When Pfizer asked help get materials make vax last fall, never even got reply previous occupant white house

A good play long term. get hopes up. new mutated strains, vaccines useless back square one. 

This misinformation.

The vaccines still provide good protection known strains virus including one South Africa. 

Second, tomorrow found variant even higher immune escape, would ""square one"". One benefits mRNA vaccines quickly easily edited allocate new variants. fact several already announced researching booster shots.

These new shots would need fully fledged trials ""The first time it, check immunogenicity,"" Marks said [the Dec. 29 ""But going another 30,000 patient clinical trial. immunogenicity studies usually 400 patients, make sure right check what's coming out.""  - FDA Top Official Peter Marks

Get vaccinated ASAP worry updating vaccines. Welp, 12.6 doses per 100 eligible people conspiracy theorists show hard evidence quiet.

So even want hear evidence unless irrefutable proof. Still hard evidence year start covid19 seems unlikely. That's way hear nothing except want hear. Yeah won’t I've wondering study would even look like. way measuring giving people virus? easy know got virus, know gave it? anyone seen kind research?  even read article? doses literally way trash people like dude give us. logistics problem distribution comes choice dose garbage literally anybody's arm clearly better arm. cutting anyone jumping line, article title misleading bad. 

The vaccinated sooner reach herd immunity sooner nightmare over. mean cut spread? entire point mass vaccination cut spread end pandemic. misinformation spread like fire - or, well, virus - early days Reddit.

But language gap scientists try avoid making claims unproven media seeking clicks articles big reasonable reporting take place subjects. administration would done exact thing. Trump get credit that. rarely watch CNN, something big happens. get news Reddit online source. I'm saying far basic cable news goes CNN bad. Whatever want agree everything said, except ""impossible.""

Very hard, sure. $trillions cost date make effort worth paying. data collection done. point, company required analyses (was efficacy similar different age groups? different side effects common different age groups? different comorbidities? write details cases interest, like someone died trial, reason believe vaccine contributed?). prepared during, there's still good amount work. 

Once done, this, running 1000+ pages, evaluated panel. I'm sure get idea would quick easy go report like that, checking statistical analysis correct, making sure important confounding variables included, evaluating results make sure balance risk benefit.. isn't. weeks means panel much beyond eat, sleep, evaluate time. Nice also told people wear masks. UK absolutely obligation. interest well-being citizens. AstraZeneca obligation. EU fighting behalf citizens, should.

I’m part! 

I’ve vaccinated ~600 people far. career become soul-wrenching come (retail pharmacist), feels great really providing key service many people. Everyone appreciative I’m sudden, instead constantly complaining. actually say even though complete total chaos last weeks, I’m actually liking job right now.  plant managers betting pool workers getting covid dying tried executed.  think what’s great J+J potential actually make Covid “just flu” even “just cold” 

Why J+J? Modern passports electronic biometric information already stored within them. hard see adapted also store vaccination status. Dems charge California spread horrible.

Logically, open vial without people lined get vaccines, ended wasted doses. could probably limited 24 hour vaccination drives. got recommended sub friend. far today, I've seen:

- Vaccines help protect infected get it
- studies shown masks effective
- need precautions first dose
- mental health! also, please entertain nonsense masks social distancing work, precautions useless people.

This place good sub valid info. Sorry asked before, know J&amp;J vaccine approved public use? LOL shit?  Thanks tip, see state offers anything like that. get that, yes, open vaccinate many people possible lower risk tiers. Targeted restrictions? there. still restriction. 

I'm sorry weighing heavily student. perfectly understandable. many situations people asking things open up. think opening indiscriminately anything close solution. No, didn't. storm hit today, numbers reported 1-2 days ago. They're low weekend like every Monday. seem ignoring that.

Ignoring speculation laundry list? Yeah, laughed US democracy (cue “it’s Republic” dorks). Yeah totally get it. 

It definitely something realise tho kids get older. 0-5, wont remember. 13-17, dont wanna anyway. 6-12? Sweet spot things/having experiences. Phase 3 trial took medication reported digit journal would pop screen said caps ‘TO CONFIRM, TOOK MEDICATION SIDE EFFECT?’, missing ‘pansy ass’ it. pretty bad muscle joint pain took 3 Advil 2 Tylenol time (which barely touched it) journal shame, didn’t say thing reported medications next visit. California still doesn’t enough doses Hopefully everything works well know. super fucking hard. Maybe check vaccine sites see need volunteers? know SD volunteer traffic control supersites get vaccine end first shift. probably actually... used word ‘idiot’ wasn’t towards you.  probably read articles headlines. It’d lot less confusing sentiments same.

So far variant making vaccines ineffective. making slightly less effective isn’t overall concern. overall concern 1) vaccine distribution 2) public behaviors.

Vaccine distribution problems since release month half ago. promised 100mil shots arms didn’t get that. even close. naturally distribution concern. News like good thing improvement current situation reduces chance substantial 3rd wave.

The next issue public behavior people. things like people wearing masks, face dicks hanging out, masks coving chins, gatherings, overall refusals acknowledge virus serious public health concern. also contributes vaccination hesitancy.

Combine two certainly risk “3rd wave” it’s vaccine itself. It’s current administration trying correct failures last. also way many people, even though we’ve 100 years science medical advancement since last significant global pandemic, still want morons conspiracy retards. going cause 3rd wave vaccines. You’re laughably ignorant. 

Take J&amp;J example: knowingly gave people cancer baby powder products. 

There hundreds examples. 

Perhaps educate yourself. Several days? almost year?   hot garbage. think australia would satisfied fighting covid thought Arizona decent? Texas? Georgia? ...... Flo-ri-da?? Hasn’t thing? flew months ago feel like going airport required mask. 
Either way didn’t see 1 person without mask. ###**STOP CLICKING CNN ARTICLE PARTIES 2024**

Lost socio-political upheaval amazing work scientists. 

We went virus discovery multiple new vaccines including brand new type vaccine (mRNA) one year. suggest keep using mask public places people guess vaccinated cu*t, feel way relaxed Covid. Wash hands ffs hygiene Covid thing (:D). Get good sleep daily things keep immune system optimal. Probably also good time get better exercise didn't. envy btw, cheers!  “The news vaccines continues excellent — public discussion continues negative facts warrant.

Here’s key fact: five vaccines public results eliminated Covid-19 deaths. also drastically reduced hospitalizations. “They’re good trial results,” Caitlin Rivers, epidemiologist Johns Hopkins University, told me. “It’s great news.”

Many people instead focusing relatively minor differences among vaccine results wrongly assuming differences mean vaccines won’t prevent serious illnesses. It’s still early sure, vaccine makers released small amount data. available data encouraging — including vaccines’ effect virus’s variants.

“The vaccines poised deliver people desperately want: end, however protracted, pandemic,” Julia Marcus Harvard Medical School recently wrote Atlantic.

What care about?
In official language research science, vaccine typically considered effective prevents people coming degree illness. disease that’s always usually horrible, like ebola rabies, definition also meaningful one.

But it’s meaningful definition coronavirus infections.

Whether realize not, almost certainly coronavirus. Coronaviruses circulating decades centuries, they’re often mild. common cold coronavirus. world isn’t going eliminate coronaviruses — particular one, known SARS-CoV-2 — anytime soon.

Yet don’t need eliminate life return normal. instead need downgrade deadly pandemic normal virus. happens, adults go back work, children back school. Grandparents nuzzle grandchildren, meet friends restaurant. Dr. Ashish Jha, dean Brown University School Public Health, told weekend: “I don’t actually care infections. care hospitalizations deaths long-term complications.”
The data
By measures, five vaccines — Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax Johnson &amp; Johnson — look extremely good. roughly 75,000 people received one five research trial, single person died Covid, people appear hospitalized. None remained hospitalized 28 days receiving shot.

To put perspective, helps think Covid done far representative group 75,000 American adults: killed roughly 150 sent several hundred hospital. vaccines reduce numbers zero nearly zero, based research trials.

Zero isn’t even relevant benchmark. typical U.S. flu season kills five 15 every 75,000 adults hospitalizes 100 them. assume would agree vaccine transforms Covid something much milder typical flu deserves called effective. scientific definition. read Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine 66 percent effective Novavax vaccine 89 percent effective, numbers referring prevention illness. count mild symptoms failure.

The variants
What highly contagious new virus variants emerged Britain, Brazil South Africa? South African variant appear make vaccines less effective eliminating infections.

Fortunately, evidence yet increases deaths among vaccinated people. Two five vaccines — Johnson &amp; Johnson Novavax — reported results South Africa, none people received vaccine died Covid. “People still getting serious illness. They’re still dying,” Dr. Rebecca Wurtz University Minnesota School Public Health told me. likely reason, epidemiologists say, vaccines still provide considerable protection variant, albeit quite much original version. protection appears enough turn coronavirus fairly normal disease vast majority cases.

“This variant clearly making little tougher get vigorous response would want have,” Dr. Francis Collins, director National Institutes Health, said. “But still, severe disease, it’s looking really good.”What would expert do?
The biggest caveat possibility future data less heartening. Johnson &amp; Johnson Novavax, example, issued press releases data, independent group yet released analysis. also important see much data vaccines interact variants. don’t confuse uncertainty bad news. available vaccine evidence nearly positive could conceivably be. overly negative interpretation causing real problems.

Some people worry schools cannot reopen even teachers vaccinated. Others left mistaken impression two vaccines highest official effectiveness rates — Moderna Pfizer — worth getting.

In truth, long data holds up, five vaccines save life.

Last week, Dr. William Schaffner Vanderbilt University told colleague Denise Grady conversation experts. it, imagined close relative choose getting Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine waiting three weeks get Moderna Pfizer vaccine. “All us said, ‘Get one tomorrow,’” Schaffner said. “The virus bad. You’re risking three weeks exposure opposed getting protection tomorrow.” Got second Moderna dose afternoon. I've prepared possible side effects. PTO tomorrow, plenty books read, airpods charged, cold chicken salad cook, electrolyte water case want eat--and snickerdoodles. FAUCI AAAAARGH IM GONNA COOM Oj Simpson vaccinated teachers.... hmmmm... news would better vaccinating high risk people first  Yes.

They're normal viruses mutate, found many mutations became daily doom gloom. something else clicks unfortunately. Seems like second wave started early also fizzling early. long new variant comes along ruins all.

Or people getting better managing risks.

Probably both. Yup. honestly never trust media again.  Brad Pitt Fauci stop watching CNN. glad people ready take back lives now, parties gonna happen 2021 better make sure it! hail vaccine ! vaccine give us peace prosperity freedom. hail 

🤣 sorry irony  Yep locally seeing attitude start shift people seeing first hand, getting testing positive fine. older are, recognize mild flu, even worst flu ever long shot friends sick either. see first hand, harder fear it. First hand experience stronger theory. Buh-bye Olympics, anyways country going win anything barely would compete all… Finland largest group intensive care 55-70 y.o. males - mean need highest number beds absolute terms, need beds per capita?

As doses currently sparse, vaccinate groups need beds per capita. males need half number beds (absolute) group size quarter, per capita bed usage still twice high vaccinating first would mean dose impact ICU caseload.

In Germany six risk categories, lower categories including people higher categories. Within group, first come first serve.

More half population group 6 (below 60, essential worker). current plans innoculate everyone last group July September, time summer helped take pressure hospital system, probably decided worth split group further. Seems legit Thanks big Joe. right, that's problem though. always impossible probe surface aerosol. That's assuming they're mutually exclusive groups. aren't.  know, sound unreasonable. family friend one vaccines second dose felt ill eat days, alone experiencing effects. bit concerning none reported released. mean vaccines stop transmission? No, see unprecedented attack individual rights. People accept mRNA. Already happening quite bit U.S. They're literally working exactly speak. presymptomatic spread colds &amp; flus actually common not. Nothing SARS2 spread extraordinary compared flus, RSV, metapneumonias, parainfluenzas, etc... 

I'm sure true. saw talk SARS expert said levels virus seen asymptomatic COVID19 patients would seen hospitlised patients original SARS epidemic.

I'm lazy deep dive confirm that, talking point throughout pandemic contagious Covid19 asymptomatic patients.


We also know Covid19 contagious Flu higher R0. think so. reduce symptoms, give risk people enough matter catch - they're protected. everyone else, optional since cases mild moderate. Nonsense.  Pessimistic imo. keep hearing June earliest gen pop. Lots conflicting info it’s fine mask public. variants effectiveness virus. see progression particular pandemic outstanding example failure education, leadership humanity whole? Yes considered polio vaccination would affected vaccinations sunday. 

0.3 - 0.4 million still terrible country size, evidenced polio vaccination capable vaccinating much higher rate. government started vaccination weeks emergency approval (unlike countries) scaled far better time prepare.

All I'm saying criticizing goverment would surely help bring urgency matter instead praising every turn like see news doing. Huge snowstorm. Might go sledding. Might build snowman. Might skid road. possibilities endless.  risk people vaccinated, reason enforce restrictions. Vaccines prevent things listed, give people happens almost cases mild moderate. lift restrictions leave vaccine optional everyone else wants necessarily need it. Varients normal, found many many became big doom gloom thing. another reason fearmonger quite frankly. Stop watching MSM tbh. wife tested positive beginning January. told contact tracer antibody 5 months still definitely get vaccine soon available. Zoom midterms! Fun times Honestly fuck CNN. lost credibility news agency last 4 years opinion.

Pandemics killed people human history. real reason going likely. people went already mostly gotten sick immunity whereas others staying home Except covid long enough incubation low enough mortality doesn’t gain advantage less lethal. numbers don’t lie cratering. Don’t panic unless see numbers drastically tick up, won’t....These variants months, they’re sequenced. vaccines work great new mrna technology updated work mutations come.

Sorry jumped throat. much empathize relate, that's can't understand there's large subsect people want this. I'm genuinely amazed someone's mental health improved year. really like working home spending day dog small, silver lining compared actual social life used have. think dangerous fall assumption people want keep things closed science telling us still need awhile. extremely optimistic summer ready things open cases fall enough folks access vaccines. Shield. let water run shingles roof caves in. Didn’t see numbers vaccine 66% effective, misunderstand something? it’s good hygiene covid isn’t germ there?  Pandemic ends - question I’m guessing vaccines approved kids probably coming April May, effort try get schools back semblance normality September Dude stfu. time original found handful people well, ignorant morons like look turned out. Grow fuck up! gave wrong numbers AZ. (Lower efficacy bounds regimen vaccine authorized under)

Efficacy 62% reported two full doses regiment per *The Lancet* publication reports media dosing regiment approved UK EU. 

I've never heard single dose tests AstraZeneca's vaccine now. I'll read source linked, ofc. Thanks. would assume data single dose efficacy statistically significant, since reported. Sputnik V's single dose numbers significant either right now. 

I think fair say cited correct efficacy AstraZeneca's vaccine. trump reason people trust America around world lol  Also warms air around face easier walk around cold. Yes.

Life start gradually getting back normal summer, everything 90% normal.

International travel giant events require months planning probably things happening summer. Life 100% mortality rate.  Let’s see much vaccine wasted AZ really effective 65 year olds. basically would start scratch. Sputnik V may appear efficacious single dose regiment J&amp;J's, that's yet investigated.

Going wait peer-reviewed published data. opposed letting spread unchecked. already saw experiment got UK variant easier spread SA variant severe. reproduction mutation virus. crush vaccine. Maybe becomes cold minor inconvenience longer becomes laboratory produces worse strains every awhile. true evaluation vaccines confined clinical trials though. Yes MRNA vaccines Covid may stop handful people getting runny nose, efficacy impact pandemic - near full protection severe disease hospitalisation. 

The difference Oxford vaccine designed purpose distributed everyone quickly cheaply. That's Oxford vaccine bigger impact pandemic vaccine technology, along policy decision, allows that. Hey dude. different conversation. side could thst limited supply getting AZ's vaccine giving younger age group. can't recall details EU multiple vaccines order maybe that's rationale. are, again, rare age group. Fauci right. key effective vaccines work new variants fast get vaccines people.

Science blind optimism day true. confused too, listening Russian media, five. Russians use Roman numerals. Like в начале XX века. brain double take / like vaccine's name. call Спутник-победа? mean data pharma companies clearly shows barely people hospitalised getting vaccinated. Looking numbers coming Israel, backs real life data. Lastly, AZ example literally said 12 week gap fine &amp; probably even better 3 week gap. makes sense vast majority vaccines there’s always gap couple months (for example Hep B) body make enough antibodies get 2nd shot. reason hasn’t proven clinical studies current vaccines trials would’ve taken much much longer keep gap 3 months first second dose. 

I think U.K. govt great job spreading like this, it’ll allow country vaccinate lot vulnerable people really quickly. Since data shows less 1% people get covid first vaccination end actually getting sick enough need hospitalisation, strategy save lives. Reinfections happened small amount people already sick.

I worry reinfection mass scale. funny partisans think President personally writes manages plans like this. Obviously nonsense. 99% people working vaccine distribution last President. What's actually important Moderna Pfizer ramping production.

PS: honestly understand people thus brain dead. ceding entire ability use brain media what? Russian Chinese science always really good goes back KNOW rushing forward, hey, cant get people even wear masks, could go wrong? 450,000 deaths later climbing Well, guess thing right then. majority whatever they’d like minority. lives privilege all. Yea, millions world naturally recovered covid? Heard immune system?
 want genes GMO vaxx Pfizer lab rat genes taken unhealthy junkfood eater sCiEnCe.

🤡 less one country lies not, lack Phase III testing. Pfizer vaccine ready April, approved later. Sputnik vaccine Phase III testing, trusted scientific community.  end, finally, getting closer closer? Ngl, gonna weird things get back normal; think I've gotten used isolation. mRNA super cool, point number people receive WAY important efficacy percent. Asia experience SARS, western nations didn't. 

I least never heard Asian country running essentials due hoarding PPE due lack stock. problems happened almost every western country Considering EMA slow comes approval, won’t available may June really need start vaccinating people hours day. 24/7 vaccination would make go lot quicker. people work night shifts start vaccinating night whoever else go night that's categories made. 14 here. true Russia’s vaccine, it’s legit/trustworthy, helpful developing countries far waiting list options. Well can't stop people, clearly, unless joking ""enforcer"" pretty bad title. know anyone else, I'm getting pretty sick damn phone. man also said J&amp;J would 100M vaccines ""April so"" J&amp;J corporate later put actual statement correcting misinformation.

I'd also like note Mr. McClellan said would enough vaccine entire adult population June. That's meaningfully stronger statement ""any (eligible) American wants vaccine get one"" We'll like 30% population pass first round anyone wants one get one enough everyone.

Now, shit guy BSing, say believe American wants vaccine able get one end June. also got remember we’re 1 shot vaccine easily distributed released. seniors given Pfizer Moderna, AstraZeneca given example teachers. agree unfair J&amp;J vaccine criticised. listen actual experts, praising pretty much vaccines shown high levels efficacy.

For every 100 people, AZ may prevent fewer amount getting runny nose, main efficacy still vaccines. Pretty much completely prevents severe disease hospitalisations. 

And effectiveness vaccines efficacy readouts trials. production, price distribution. point good vaccine clinical trials can't given certain countries infrastructure money distribute it. Fuck COVID. Oh awesome!! Congrats

I hope get vaccine soon well wash hands? existing vaccines shown effective variants - yes, even great South African variants. *millions* Americans getting vaccinated every day. pessimism negativity going pan out, sorry. realized something. someone answer me? get shot symptoms shot (like arm hurting stuff) could already covid already antibodies? way figure covid already? Flu mutates even more. Afaik article based interim phase 3 report, lets wait actual data. Can't +1 enough. hope everyone vaccine development - data accurate proves efficacy retransmission outcome. chase eliminate miserable disease, wherever Earth possible, better. Whole pandemic ends tomorrow, £10000 actually tempting, would selfish considering people businesses dying. Gotta like 500k start thinking it.

Pandemic ends hands down. can't buy mental health. It’s almost like competent administrations make things better. I’ve worked nursing homes 12 years. You’d surprised anti science medical workers be.  It’s infuriating. Educated guess, would assume variants milder terms severity, contagious.  Damn that’s pretty low considering population logic basically whatever takes work you, owed anything right thing.


OK, we'll reopen everything one ""owed"" us keeping things closed. level education little it, IMO.

It’s numeral tho. company also said Tuesday ""prepared respond"" Covid variant demonstrates evidence resistant vaccine. recent weeks, U.S. health officials, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, said concerned vaccines currently market may effective guarding new, contagious strains slides published, Pfizer said patients ""likely need boost regularly maintain immune response counter emerging variant strains."" That's figure less 6 week gap doses, yeah. Wide confidence intervals, however. 12-week gap efficacy 82.4%. I’ve taken seriously whole time people hysterical. know kids get seriously ill risk high enough people act like kids. kids die car wrecks died Covid know she’s going put car again. Correct, authors discuss **interim analysis, identified higher efficacy subgroup analysis received LD/SD** regimen14. finding **confirmed current analysis**, data available, show enhanced immunogenicity efficacy regimen **may partly driven longer dosing interval feature group**, supporting observation relationship dose interval efficacy SD/SD group discussed supported emergency use authorisation. ehhh, prediction somewhat correct, incorrectly predicted people promoting idea. dudes 100. Let wants. 19 years UK's average life expectancy. I'm sure asked old people locked they'd say they'd rather live life normally locked away die alone anyway. asthma considered chronic respiratory disease? pissed cereal? currently Pfizer Moderna vaccines coming in, AstraZeneca starting shipments sometime next two weeks. 

There single week Canada received 0 vaccines. Fauci confirmed SA variant evades Immunity previous infections one Brazils top virologists confirmed Manaus surge due reinfections I've back normal since last summer.

But 4 days post vaccine yes I'll resuming aspects life want besides dealing unnecessary travel restrictions mean I’ve already seeing family except mother see outside due high risk. I’ll probably start going restaurants again. Seeing friends indoors they’re vaccinated. lot friends still live home they’re parents vaccinated imagine we’ll hanging indoors. certain person's attempts buy U.S. exclusive access vaccines last year prompt. Especially PPE export ban fiasco. Canada similarly situated countries started domestic plans back then. big snow storm possibly recommend good masks worn make sure they're available. page 20 original article discussed. conclusion persons dying elder care homes would fared better icu, average. asthma complications byproduct getting cold amazing! even know drawer inhaler shoved point.

 what’s best interest everyone problem ? It’s mask small piece cloth face. Kinda like pieces cloth ( shirts , pants , )your asked wear go side public . started college year think age group too. prom, graduation, class trip Universal, trip friends Bimini, basically whole summer cancelled. started college online. I'm going university semester classes still online, pretty shitty year far  ongoing battle pneumonia past year San Diego, pharmacies already doses booked weeks. change things? Good them. remember everyone talking shit first came out. know xenophobia communist past, world fighting common enemy, Covid19 mutations. develop two immunities dose Adenovirus vector; Sars-CoV2 (spike protein) Adenovirus itself. injected virus **has to** infect cells make produce spike protein; know, immune system like virus infecting around, builds immunity it. second dose makes immune system face viral vector, antibodies let detected, viral vector time attacked passing message cells, since vaccines Sars-CoV2 common cold, risk second dose make fully improve Sars-CoV2 immunity. 

Gamaleya (Sputnik-V) got 91% efficacy probably used two different viral vectors, first prejudicing second (not much, least)

Oxford used one run humans. viral vectors Adenovirus strains

Now, since immunity Adenovirus pretty sucks, possible 3 months doses, immune system ""forgets"" Adenovirus vector, lets pass job, infect cells make produce Spike proteins. 

By way, Covid vaccines way try get Spike proteins us. Adenovirus mRNA making cells produce them; Novavax produces lab directly injects Probably fast. I’m expecting late spring biggest problem mutants vaccine may work them. need develop another vaccine, delay going back normal least year, probably longer. probably going case two-shot vaccines sweet spot around 12 weeks second jab. can't afford to, especially Florida never able get unemployment. state made near impossible sign up. preventing younger population right really help long term? mean whole reason covid restrictions primarily elderly/vulnerable filling hospitald. main aim right prevent hospitlisations. Although guess use vaccinate say teachers could probably prevent schools close etc Would Take Putin's vaccine? 

😬 Yeah. gets special treatment. family room dies many others even allowed that. 

I agree age let want. life expectancy country want already well. grandparents late 80s surprised even wake everyday.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think that? first shot already gives good immune response, much safer first shot nothing. vaccination passports people completed vaccine initial vaccine booster? realistic expect Daily US COVID deaths 100/day March 12th? I’m confused hadn’t put much guidance *before* started vaccinating public. makes sense people health care get fully vaccinated, regardless prior infection, older people likely worse immune response, feel like government could put guidance. I’m vaccinating people tested positive previously, feel like maximize supply. save half supply giving people previously tested positive one dose instead two, like study seems support, could vaccinate many people. Obviously studies would need done, think keep options open. vaccines stop deaths hospitalizations, that's important overlooked statistic.

Don't understand people want vaccines fail. Pfizer lead player one biggest pharmaceutical fraud history settled 2.3B. yeah, best track record, know.

 health regulator said still enough data effectiveness AstraZeneca vaccine patients 65 years data arrive coming weeks. meantime recommend use people 65 years old,"" said. recommended vaccine health workers vulnerable people ages 50 65. vaccinations ramp europe? 👌👌 article explain why. helpful. one is. OP catastrophizing. Go find another corner cry in. GTFO conspiracy nonsense. wonder coronavirus missed inauguration sure seems like turned new leaf decided magically start positive took private sector save day. state federal government ironically nothing lift regulations said sector provided private citizens dress code. Oh thanks straightening out! Bless you. 
You've gone much. 
With said, I'm glad found form relief. 

I tens unit. times get nerve blocks, get relief 2 days tops. 

The spinal cord stimulator scares me. costly to. 

 heavy research it

I pray keep strength, find relief lives journey boat, sisters 2 4 I've talking taking Disney World since live nearby. younger one able much surprised see older one tall enough rides already! birthdays July really hope Eh, I’m pro mask, I’m strong lockdown skeptic. still floors there's people think great job handling it. Makes wonder would take think screwed up? 1 million deaths? Florida's data grade Atlantic's Covid team: covid country. making us treat old people like shit appreciating theyre old enough make choices. 19 years average life expectancy UK. good innings. good went away last year opposed many old people seen families months. think wrong got special treatment allowed family hospital died many others apparently refused. sad. chances even waking morning reduced even every day lived age. mean would take right now. July August would definitely take AZ vaccine. wait 2-3 months second shot means can't travel anywhere summer.  There’s another vaccine Russians made mainly potatoes..called Spudnik. Thanks advance. Eh he's young, he'll fine. good enough, herd immunity yet. want vaccinated people comply restrictions business owners like way knowing vaccinated. solution vaccine passports would come set issues. Granted, see issue two sets vaccinated people meeting private eschewing restrictions. really mainly applies public spaces. mRNA vaccines stop people catching virus spreading it. prevent serious illness.

Bad luck vaccine resisters. US population. one gonna lose breath US requesting special treatment order able protect population.

Again, need want market US. FDA different regulation agree UK going advice scientific community spacing 2 doses. 

I curious, go advice scientific community spacing 2 doses? 21 days? Yes reality UK blocking exports, bought first 100m vaccines one factory.

Note start last year, UK basically vaccine manufacuring capability. service-based economy. EU, made 27 countries, manufacturing powerhouse.

Do really think wrong take 100m yourself, completely new capabilities paid for, also giving away billions pounds, genome sequencing resources, secured 1.3bn cheap (at cost!) doses poor countries? Especially country one hardest hit world? I'd say no. that's also assuming numbers accurate.

A lot cases went ""bronchitis"", especially 1st months pandemic. vulnerable staying home much can. true. I'm sorry getting depressed shit, sense minority people perfectly fine wearing masks public places. Same. wanna take boy zoo science center. Seriously, make comment sticky Astra Zeneca pass also due recently becoming politicized EU/UK controversy too. Brexiteers jumped take credit even average UK person exposed much propaganda there's weird kind nationalism that's developed around it. Good news!

Hopefully get shot September. Time weather.

Got compare like like. company aims seven manufacturing facilities running end second quarter ramp supply, Wolk said. That's assumed south america, 8 months later mass graves supposedly reaching 75% herd immunity. month data extremely flawed set trials really anything new. still flawed. Combining data trials one set placebo get saline , get meningococcal vaccine, include dosing error, entire subgroups excluded , dosing regimes vary significantly anything confident of. new, rehash. I'll wait FDA data , unless AZ bungled one too. Despite huge advantage weather, density, time FL ass kicked. Cavalry here. fight little bit longer. We’re almost worst this. guy named J.D Farag high risk family members unable leave fucking bedroom Florida what's happened. nightmare vulnerable populations Florida 10 months. That's assumed south america, 8 months later mass graves supposedly reaching 75% herd immunity. Trump still lost Florida hicks get decide National Covid strategy anymore, thank god.

States still decide Covid policy.

Nothing really change 40 states citizens still free. get vaccine you’ve waited 10-14 days, planning going back normal? Going out? Seeing family? take - side effect keep walking around house going beep. Beep. Beep .. claiming Pfizer et. al. lying public? Even purely selfish standpoint, would incredibly dumb move part. vaccine work, people would find quickly reputation would greatly damaged, mention lawsuits fines. hand, vaccine really ineffective variants make additional money selling booster shot. Thanks adding included bit.   New game, many corona variants catch within 1 hour? sure media reading listening to. guessing also hyperbolic stock comment. hearing ""game changer"", ""normal cold storage"", ""single dose"", ""billion doses end 2021"". 

Lol. understand butthurt attitude, whatever. media presenting J&amp;J's results underwhelming forced defend efficacy. Dr Fauci said become spoiled thanks ultra high efficacy Pfizer's Moderna's vaccine. responding sentiment rose response J&amp;J's results. seriously trying suggest J&amp;J faced skepticism met sense disappointment can't take seriously. agree disappoinent media populus, agree me. AstraZeneca criticised conflicting data, RELATIVELY lower efficacy. facts that's meant stock near time highs

It plummeted initially. never said badly now. I'm hyperbolic, incapable nuance jump conclusions. That’s 20% death.

Did undermine shit.

And who’s economy better position, FL. Good luck too... stay safe, stay healthy. Isnt Pfizer vaccine still effective South African variant? still claiming ""governments going mandate permanent masking distancing even mass vaccinations"" correct prediction despite proof claiming randos media setting policy examples, counter evidence even heavily locked states relaxing restrictions already? oh wow, congrats Americans, normal life resume soon!  Ya, great indicator --but I'm looking something that's little ""prophetic"" nature. Something help inform approaches making long-term plans/decisions (on small big scales ideally). Something considers myriad civil, health, economic, etc. aspects creates logical, data-driven model examined insight. Something goes beyond vaccine roll-out, herd-immunity, fatality counts, etc. know, there's huge amount aspects opening society fully, fatalities hospitals. Thanks input though! Presymptomatic Infection: Individuals test positive SARS-CoV-2 using virologic test (i.e., nucleic acid amplification test antigen test) symptoms consistent COVID-19.

Mild Illness: Individuals various signs symptoms COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss taste smell) shortness breath, dyspnea, abnormal chest imaging.

Moderate Illness: Individuals show evidence lower respiratory disease clinical assessment imaging saturation oxygen (SpO2) ≥94% room air sea level.

Severe Illness: Individuals SpO2 &lt;94% room air sea level, ratio arterial partial pressure oxygen fraction inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) &lt;300 mm Hg, respiratory frequency breaths/min, lung infiltrates Illness: Individuals respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction. Fancy that. rarely happier eat words. Well done Russia. hero! Yes, bees.  go: SAVE BEES!!!! logic clinically tested covid 19 vaccines able give us protection. infection starts lower respiratory tract (alveoli). SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelial cells part lungs replicates spreads around. causes different immune cells arrive site, fight virus enough strength defend us bacteria causes bacterial lung infections lung inflammation. 

Now, logic, seeing think antibodies produced via i.m. injection can't end respiratory tract, antibodies produced could never bind virus enters alveolar cells. 

My question imagine vaccines prevent disease? 

The truth IgG antibodies induced vaccines wind respiratory tract neutralize virus enters alveolar cells. prevents replicating can't detect swab using RT-PCR. Now, sometimes vaccinated individuals develop strong enough antibody response prevents virus entry completely. Sometimes don't, amount antibodies develop helps fight virus quickly, sometimes deploying cytotoxic cells case viral entry cells prominent. 

Now, true nasal vaccines looked at, purposes increasing efficacy, introducing new features. Well person 66 state opened 65-69 age group. I'll never forget doctors office teenager, seeing large muscle building grown man pass drew blood saw it. [Not data shows anyway answer question. many deadlier pandemics, never things like lockdowns, banning public gatherings indefinitely, population-wide social distancing.

The issue whether virus mutate something deadlier whether continue case might mutate something deadlier, something resistant vaccines.

At point think pre-2020 pandemics better handled done we're doing, may never stop. Hopefully I'm wrong end. 28 Days Later. NZ locked early enough, great work there. Aus too, also far spaced too, plus places get cold Aus winter. mean friends and/or family listening you, believe written Q&amp;A either. would need hear news source actually listen Facebook celebrity whatever. nothing won’t solve problem, answer something fails collapses society. arm little sore first round, it. people know got second shot felt like crap fevers. I'm hoping sore arm only! all. Get nice respirator near 100% personal protection. 20 years, try stop you. also makes excellent Olympian catch drift thinks guy devoted life public health cares Time's person year

He also cares fame (why else give interviews Matthew McConaughey go baseball game guest honor middle pandemic?) money (did know got paid 400K 2019 higher Presidential salary?). know people got infected NYC last time restaurants opened indoors 25%. guess yes make worse. entire table got sick 60th birthday party. survived one ended hospital week.

If could make people quarantine arrive NYC, like Australia China New Zealand, could limit transmission. scheduled appointment October sounds like mistake. think states opened vaccinations general public yet probably start month so. Maybe told October tell eligible appointment yet. ate thanksgiving family we're pandemic way out. bizzare! already argumented instead counter argumenting repeated words, nothing surely solve problem right ? Anyways, Hey milvet, wanted say understand saying kinda understand you’re getting downvoted, don’t agree downvotes. I’m ADN RN myself.

I’m israeli got first dose three hours ago problem data. Sorry, clarified. disputing claim all. Multiple sources agree you. wondering would classified ""severe illness"" require hospitalization.

I always thought literal definition ""severe"" necessarily meant hospitalization, must using different definition CDC? missing United States Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) created list certain comorbidities associated severe disease (defined infection resulting hospitalization, admission intensive care unit [ICU], intubation mechanical ventilation, death) can’t imagine means young kids, know? kids 5 year old range can’t get vaccinated 2022 later, that’s lot school miss. sooner everyone vaccinated, better everyone. new variants would never change emerge nipped thing bud earlier. This, look ohio making decisions curfew bars close. based hospitalizations mean that's probably worst thing. waking reality prepared probably never cope it.

Totally bro. half million dead nbd, shoulda opened long ago. 2 weeks, amiright??? Salt water? claiming completely safe effective back August actually phase 3 trials simultaneously allowing independent testing. absolute moron consider even remotely trustworthy point time.  know isn’t respiratory illness. Minimizing virus disease doesn’t help case. lockdowns aren’t affordable compare cost virus illness death.

RemindMe! 2 weeks Yes, like said, individual cases major investigation launched matter. article posted also points decisions made regional level. places handled better others.

The times see examples something done incorrectly (or someone thinks so). Exceptions, basically. make denying someone care would've benefitted okay, course. released yesterday.

Actually released today, date link quite right.  That's literally whole point. given long interval second shot raised efficacy 76% 82%

That's actually pretty noteworthy improvement.

Going 76% 82% means rate infections goes 24% 18% -- one fourth remaining cases removed. saw article Louvre closed. sounded like strict lockdown. Guess see actually happening. Eventually consider wrong predictions. said true things half says also turned lies. lockdowns going year, covid still went crazy. didn’t work. like failed systems, lockdown proponents say didn’t lockdown hard enough. No. doesn’t work. isn’t going make work. [Oxford vaccine may reduce transmission Based “... decides go back coma three months.” I'm pretty sure Middle East. TBH sketch went promoting vaccine, deep knew probably legit.

Don't forget 2nd doses! mean, currently colloquially used name. 


It still use. used historical movies. Amazing news, complete vindication UK regulator depends we're able convince under-40's take shot. dismal figure like 45% Los Angeles firefighters opted :/

There's huge number ppl feel like need to. think partially due idea makes look weak, like they're frail &amp; vulnerable seniors. realize vaccine them... literally stopping virus' ability spread throughout community. starving virus new hosts. hospitalizations deaths vaccine arm trial 28-day period immunity developed. Well UK released another set data stating risk mortality went 1 non-VOC (variant concern) 1.65 VOC, probably due strong binding ACE2 receptors lungs. 

So things changed, avoid immune system/vaccine, causing reinfection killing people vaccine meant protect. hope virus gets less lethal severe selective pressure making worse it’s race time/adequate vaccination/herd immunity. We'll see. typical flu season US 200 deaths day height season. thinking applying front-line worker position myself. Big true tbh  think will.

Looks like 79K doses week, 70K doses next week (week Feb 8th). Following two weeks 336K 396K respectively close February.

That means cumulative 1.66 million doses end February.

That leaves 2.33 million doses March (assuming Pfizer holds end deal 4 million Q1). Assuming 5 deliveries March, leaves 468K doses per week. calm nerves lot. Literal nonsense Counterargument: no, absolutely fuckin *not* time. Canada helping smaller countries vaccine. Enough examples countries hard lockdowns work. think European country went hard lockdown, let good hard laugh. 

Not single European country hard lockdown. Belgium probably hardest all, mandating mask wearing indoor outdoor, allowing single visitor outside household (same person entire duration lockdown), etc. matters borders remain open (even European countries YOLO'ing time), ""foreigners"" even tested arrival (let alone put 2 weeks quarantine hotel), police going soft approach telling ppl wear masks instead giving fucking fines they've told give, positive cases separated rest society, kids 14 wear mask, crappy contact tracing, etc. 

What fucking joke European approach been. Leaving borders open economic union, taking political actions level protect economy. pay attention data out.  r/science keeps upvoting “headline studies” like “Antimaskers psycho/antisocial/any negative qualities promaskers”. remember guy r/coronaviruscirclejerk decided review headline one “studies” break word word study it. conclusion amateur headline lots mistakes it. Plus said unquantifiable quality true antimaskers.

TL;DR : r/science basically shut-in circlejerk hates antimaskers much upvote garbage headlines insult antimaskers don’t follow scientific theory all.  vaccine deployed since August death rate continued growing flatlining peak weeks...  Absolutely. “sitting sidelines” nonsense needs end. brilliant scientists country. It’s time encourage give funding lead rather follow. Reddit disproves this. Anything China, Russia trustworthy.   Ah yes, remember early 2020 Anthony fauci said wear mask, asia dumb paranoid continent Getting people's arms = trivial Well, exponential growth seems difficult grasp lot people. wasn't, people saying ""There 15 cases US. There's millions flu cases anything flu!""  Why? What?? July Im assuming mean end July? see enough doses 57% German population end Q2 first world countries every adult usually 75-85% population. weird teachers aren’t coming defense. I’m really tired reading articles comments teachers. Sorry failed America hate man dedicated life science fighting disease much? severe misdirected anger messenger rather actual source problem.

Fauci killed grandma telling people ***not*** wear masks first months pandemic. liar, always liar. ну камрад, ты серьезно думаеш что назвали вакцину ""спутник-Vиктория""? даже русское имя кончаетса на ""v"". кому ты мозги моешь, и за чем?  enough data though. That's EMA approved ages. That's countries across globe done same. French simply adopting higher standard. 

Again, choice. data coming Britain making clear, looking likely real consequences higher standards preventable deaths caused hesitation use effective vaccine. I'm NJ, megasites across state closed two days. also likely die giant meteor strikes planet.

At point Fauci needs knock layers doom upon doom and, won't, people need stop paying attention him, sanity. want people simply give up? Constantly telling everything they're pointless even disease death remains around corner great way it.

Edit: Missed word. would rational person vote down. factual. Downvoting facts ridiculous. honestly think epidemiologists private sector salary 4 million USD per  Nice bullshit stuck end. 

That’s probably reason get downvoted oblivion. really think 25% capacity going sustain restaurant industry? Especially cases increase people afraid dine indoors. restaurant industry deserves bailout (along fitness, nightclubs, industries devastated). really saddens see it’s basically every country fighting thus comes vaccines. always poorer people lose most, case lose long term this, drives prices delay worldwide trade travel longer necessary. give virus chance mutate. 

Canada bought enough vaccines vaccinate population 4 times over. really hope richer countries take responsibility.   googled mom got KN95 mask asked could borrow one thought safer masking up. think got Amazon, I’m worried 🙃 Look another job...everyone immunized wear badge clearly indicating avoid them. vaccination success story made jingoistic imo. basically can't say anything make UK look like masters even saviours planet. 28 days later... going allow immunocompromised? assuming natural immunity sufficient stop infectious variants progressing severe disease. certainly hope that's case, know yet. state variants already starting get foothold we're 6% vaccinated.

Also 60% still immunity variants 30% deadlier covid based latest data. Nothing particular significance article, scientist ruling something evidence yet for. US lied horrible ways led death destruction much wider scale Russia. Nothing Russia done past 20 years even come remotely close lies led war Iraq. United States intervened far foreign elections Russia has, financed dictatorships pushed governments protect American Business interests. I'm sure live, damage lies United States' propagated extremely damaging. 

That's say Russia lie well. thing Russia lies things west normally lie about. said, US also likes accuse Russia lying they're not. hope means graduation ceremony lie mask-wearing necessary backtracked **months** after. even admitted record. liar, always liar. nuked account 2012. Used be. sincerely don’t understand people trying do. This. don’t need perfect, good enough. vaccines we’re working start nearly miraculous results, unless mutations render completely impotent world still able get point function normally slightly higher hygiene standards. infact need play im staying home nothing do. theres like 1k basketball players. even less. theres like 360 basketball players. vaccinate em understanding scientists British regulatory agencies got hands data skeptical LD/SD efficacy difference result dosing, instead might LD batch went early trial participants received second dose weeks apart first participants, plus statistical artifact small sample size. current focus seems studying whether longer spacing doses leads higher efficacy.  Surely first time got experience Joe mama though. Mmm...no thanks I'm extremely curious would UK plants production problems AZ fail deliveries, EU said European plants Europeans first ""contract"".

Of course happen, happen beginning, happening now. still vaccines going Europe UK USA.

It's rather odd Boris make stand European made vaccines Europeans first, would rather noble line current stance.  know side effects AZ mild, certainly give immunity 65+ population, lot people die get Pfizer moderna vaccine, nothing stops Pfizer vaccines given people later already az vaccine.

Essentially little harm potentially much good vaccinate 65 population therefore decision baffling   whose fault lol   Subject justice. 

I’m fully LAPD one.

They criminals. Yea...that’s gonna happen. actual (counted uncounted) infections vaccinations looking 40% + population varying degrees immunity what’s everyone’s thoughts “circuit breaker?” Easing restrictions case breaks two weeks lockdown. (I can’t tell article saying lockdown area/place occurred entails)

Seems reasonable everyone could get decent mask...I can’t find disposable N95’s less $3. Absurd. kid size kn95 would cool Honestly get back normal end year things going get bad, government crazy debt, states like NY CA damn near bankruptcy, people going start loosing faith currency leading inflation. minimum inflation crisis like 1970s worse may see something like Argentina experiencing.  even funnier realize couple months ago sub would treated everything said gospel.  JnJ released protocol study online, includes case definition. read it, see severe cases require hospitalization. probably also explains discrepancy 85% efficacy preventing severe cases 100% efficacy hospitalization / death. I.e. still small chance getting severely ill despite vaccine, bad require hospitalization. still strain matched though, right? ""Anyone age 16 older"" ... tell me. image near end article (which I'll post clarity: post /r/science day basically ""mushrooms good provide vitamins"" realized what's going there. Anything less what's needed make ends meet functionality aid.

If people work paid enough made whole, sure I'd less critical, clearly that's happening enhanced unemployment run people paid 70% income they're lucky enough even sign unemployment systems strained, direct payments 1800 10 months actual joke payment, still try get eviction mortgage freezes.....we would needing economy healthy...

The reason bad 08 eyes widespread, touching industries (restaurants etc) hitting Indutries worse 08 did. Also help industries exactly high paying ones world begin with, instead hitting middle class, primarily hitting poor extra hard. pretty much worst world. evidence contacted covid school?

Eta: 9 school aged children died, say 9 children attended school died. Based data russians testing Russia. Let's trust Russians, never lied before. I'm enjoying want things open! like option, even 99 times 100 I'll choose stay home.  EU never threatened produce themselves, **the EU even said oppose vaccine nationalism beginning**, get talking about.

You must talking control measure guarantee manufacturer abiding contract claimed fail delivery millions vaccines.

Basically EU doubling sourcing new pharmaceutical companies, can't count USA UK, since full vaccine nationalism place. One executive order, order per contract design (to look good picture, Trump rude would ban vaccine exports, right?).

I'm curious see way around: UK plant production problems EU refused fulfill UK vaccines want vaccinate Europeans first. 

It's weird altruism European made vaccines sent UK, Boris say: ""oh please vaccine population first, wait finished send us UK said start position screwing countries, help UK roll complete

I really understand keep saying this, first currently countries producing (USA UK), still take vaccines foreign countries,(...)

And keep repeating I've said several times, like trying make point repeating I've wrote. 3 things:

1. mask wearing common Asia doesn’t mean happen western world. East southeast Asian countries generally considerably collectivistic culture western countries likely leads much higher mask-wearing compliance. know SARS wasn’t start mask-wearing Asia sure make prevalent, one hardest hit countries SARS actually Canada, live. Nobody wore masks anywhere pre-covid Canada except job health care worker. people idea heads Asia place dealt pandemics epidemics past? western world dealt pandemics epidemics Spanish flu, Asian flu, Hong Kong flu, swine flu, SARS, covid mask-wearing never mainstream thing. likely nutjobs won’t take mask get mad people wearing masks busses stores on, that’s always going small minority people.

You take culture account. people one country doesn’t means imply people another. 

2. can’t speak Asia personal experience ~4 months spent Southeast Asia people really tend wear masks riding motorbikes. mean people wearing walking street suppose kind chalked Saigon Hanoi very, smoggy. people entered malls buildings they’d usually put masks chin take altogether. mostly Vietnam - don’t remember people Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, malaysia wearing masks much all. know experience Asian feel like lot westerners sub idea Asian people masking much (so basically time) that’s case. 

3. know seems noble “mask symptoms don’t get people sick” two issues people seem gloss entirely - first, masks really, really annoying it’s unreasonable expect people mask first sign trouble, cough might cold could also asthma, among things. runny nose might mean you’re sick, it’s also possible it’s allergies cold weather irritating nose. Second, think recognize getting sick, unless you’re already immunocompromised it’s serious illness, probably good thing. need build immune system get sick less later get sick, won’t bad. everyone wearing masks, yes you’ll probably get sick much less, get sick (which inevitable unless never leave house), it’s going much unpleasant. case swine flu, disease disproportionally hit younger people older people exposure flu strains past immune systems could deal better. go entire life barely getting sick, inevitably get sick, it’s likely much worse. either deal that, accept cold flu part lives almost never serious. 

TLDR: Cultural differences lead differences mask compliance, Asian countries don’t wear masks frequently normal times people think (in experience), wearing masks keep people getting sick normal disease isn’t unambiguously positive thing people think is. really wouldn’t surprised started talking requiring goggles. dude, tried true vaccines mRNA vaccines started testing *last February* technology developed tested past *decade* using well understood science. Considering every possibility science? Every nation laboratories working viruses. virus created wet market, I'm shocked plethora viruses emanated places mother brought Louisiana.  Равно как имя может быть известно. И то, что не понимают значение, как раз значит, что слово не заимствованное. Если бы было заимстовованным, то значило бы то же самое, что в исходном языке (как компьютер, принтер, сайт, и т.д.). Чекни определение заимствования. Yes yes yes, good news, inject directly veins (as thing going veins start offering vax group 3C whatever). Back July, predicted happening got told stupid, misinformed, full shit one could predict long terms effects. me, hard see virus could kill would leave people long term effects. article authorities investigating whether strain coronavirus detected four people Jalisco Mexican variant SARS-CoV-2, senior health official said cases virus E484K mutation detected Friday. mutation, appears make coronavirus contagious, detected new strains South Africa Brazil.


E484K mutation South African Brazilian discovered variants help evade antibodies previous infection &amp; make vaccines less effective. also suddenly appeared UK cases UK variant. mutation keeps popping place like this, makes virologist concerned virus independently random mutation finding advantage. mean though. covid longer deadly grandma, gives cold, there's risk even catch it. teachers. They're front line workers right medical staff public transport operators comes infection death rates. Numbers hard come by, random union local reports. counted 300 separate reporting pools clearly them. Also hard get total counts workers get percentage. Good Indonesia, hope widespread, year round mask wearing never catches United States. Define ""normal"", though. I'd say given volume long covid might serious second time round cannot take hold  Racist comments, even ""jokes,"" acceptable sub. vaccines reduce covid cold require hospitalization though, would still need restrict activities? Outside variants, course.

Just still contract covid mean dangerous anymore. I'm struggling mentally. Last year track finally become airline pilot working toward decade. might happen years. industry that's heavily dependent seniority, I'm wasting time. year waiting another year missing higher pay next level (upgrading first officer captain, moving mainline carrier regional, etc.) Factor next 30 years reach mandatory retirement age huge impact. really think stretch say COVID going cost million dollars course career.

Now I'm worried quality life new pilots going take hit. looking starting salary $45k-55k bonuses $60. certainly kiss bonuses goodbye fear base pay/benefits going suffer. decade ago new pilots making less $25k year. don’t know specifics NYC, vaccine tourism seem thing Isnt recent decline less travel? decline began Jan 10thish, would expected Christmas New Years.

I suspect next weeks though, vaccines start show impact booster mean required second dose (of Pfizer Moderna)? booster. want know happened dilation drops! 10 year old daughter fainted dilation nearly puked first optometrist appt really freaked never figured how/why happened   take long people sub become anti-lockdown?     Risk? Yep. took morning first second shot. Found info day second dose. we'll see. felt pretty shitty second dose probably still effective knows. need ibuprofen get day. Severe arthritis ankylosing spondylitis. Totally unrelated vaccine. Oh well Well obviously want prevent giving covid patients mostly elderly.  Normal summer. Sorry Lol wonder they’re going twist lies made past year know take months ""hardest."" I'm positively last line vaccine I'm literally losing live here. refreshing news. Keep good news coming. Hey now. Let’s kink-shame. I'm security guard deemed Essential(sacrificial). ass aint gettin anytime soon feel. I’d really like know fucking vaccines are. mom 70, cancer, I’ve got every list area STILL waiting. Pretty much, it’s already summer south haha ""Yeah. Yeah, illness. fact, brought numbers. conservatively estimate could require 48 million hospitalizations, 96 million cases actually occurring, 480000 deaths occur next three seven months situation. ""

He wrong. Period. 

*transcribed pod Joe Rogan. I’ll credit allowing scientific discussions mask mandate. also really hope virtue signalers want masks permanent give rest sake service workers. us able work home need wear masks drop store inconvenient, whatever. feel bad service industry folks wear one things day.

This lot people website seem forget think. Sure, mask big deal *them* work home. them, masks 20-minute grocery trip that's it. They're thinking service workers—or worse, factories, warehouses, etc.—who wearing masks eight, 10, 12 hours shitty conditions. thing. have. Keep coming. heard super bugs created hospitals? bad vaccine news lab producing fast enough. Following sub past year depressing bad news good news. long time, sentiment get worse gets better. finally see end hopefully gets better on. weather? Hmm...
Ok well lets see goes March. hopeful. 

I’m concerned there’ll another lockdown next winter panic new strains, second holiday season lockdown nuke governor’s re-election prospects. Yeah like three months now... I'm sure that.

Maybe less severely ill end taking hospital beds. Remember, protocols many hospitals crazy, admissions ""milder"" disease, oxygen unless sats consistently 89, etc.

Could easily fill beds adequately treated milder cases. love attitude. wish people willing work look bright side otherwise dumpster fire situation. hurt spraying ton chemicals everything coming two weeks :/  Bear mind corona cases take days months pass away due complexity treatment sometimes amounts dumb luck theres decent staffing ratio. Debbie there's least silver lining hope somewhat form vaccination. recommend prior even kick ass try damnedest still obtain it. One co-worker reinfected 8 months after. Today husband attended info session Montessori preschool baby born pandemic. Optimistic get start fall! Fantastic!! NSAIDs bigger problem. heard Tylonel problem.  got doses parents gettkng first one vaccine. year going right direction Damn! mean thing say gf! ever actually nursing home?

My grandmother 90 years old home last several years. received Pfizer vaccine last month, though doesn’t understand why. nursing home people lived long go die, without hope ever improving. patients mind — grandma always confused whether son grandson, residents always aired various conspiracy theories escape plans involving electricity swapping brains dogs, attacked another resident mistakenly thought entered three children leaving two accused murdering third child. hour would make question mental health. can’t imagine actually working day every day.

It’s great we’re vaccinating nursing home residents. COVID unpleasant death, deserve less painful one. workers, completely miserable hopeless job never pay adequately 99% people live long enough require nursing home care retirement money left pay it. workers refuse vaccine get fired, there’s nobody left work. elderly people would die neglect COVID. Haha!  WV also killing vaccines. Thanks! No, always quantified. tell you, get hit car stand road 12 pm. around 11:59pm, moved road, wrong, changing behavior result warnings change outcome? answer latter. You’d also consider Canada’s per capita death toll would likely lower U.S.’s lower. probably ever lower number small percentage even 170,000. I’d like see math 60,000 450,000 misunderstood    That’s different article, that’s mentioned article linked 

And referring variants. guess specified  misinterpretation kind protection vaccine provides. 95% number efficacy stopping symptomatic disease- it’s likely, theory, still transmit catch Covid normally, except you’d personally asymptomatic. either case, parents vaccinated you. plus side, Moderna Pfizer vaccines using mRNA tech, turnaround updated version account new strains quick. expect we'll see versions distributed late summer onwards accounting them, probably sooner. They're also working boosters shore effectiveness new vaccine variant would available.

J&amp;J kinda fucked situation old-gen vaccine tech, can't keep mutations. even gotten vaccine rolled new problem mutation strains big issue tackle. easier distribution help lot cost deployment least, much useful enough vaccinations achieve herd immunity thus see fewer new strain variants pop up. steps they’ve already taken competent plan we’ve year though. Reddit without Trump corona Yeah. ""Entertaining visitors"" probably lot dangerous going grocery store. fair Nursing facilities make much. usually stack sevices make profit. devil details. studies done directly measure whether participants became infected virus - would require testing everyone study every days. Instead, test participants virus start show symptoms fever cough. efficient (important study 40,000+ people it), means know many people caught virus without showing symptoms. Unfortunately, know sometimes people asymptomatic still spread virus. win shiny new award!  lol   watching Tiger King decided never visit drive thru safari near house. couple weekends ago said fuck went two year old needed sort excitement life. Bull. I. Haven’t stepped foot church last year wife almost never brings up. know still long battle ahead. Cases US went third two weeks. could put foot gas bit, see last two-thirds 6 weeks. 💎🙌 also jnj trial, got torn pretty badly. covered up! 

Still glad got though.  instead dogs... it’s goats. 😂  understanding, that's rate people catch virus *at all*. However, almost everyone gets disease getting vaccination much less severe case, 20 percent likely ends something like mild cold symptoms (if symptoms all). even reason asshole being. need calling ""uneducated"" ""dumb bowl soup"". Sad. 👺 harder perpetrate systemic wage theft work home. Still possible, harder. vaccine available Raleigh NC matter age health. 99 Year old aunt can’t get vaccine Pennsylvania. Spent hours daily phone doctor vaccine numbers. It’s BS. one we’ve talked boat many us 65. Even healthcare workers still appointments vaccine. kid shy 3 pre-pneumonia october/november right covid.  child. occasionally sees cousin year older teaching share together bit harder think would socialization earlier. 

Or kids selfish... Here's hoping summer better. link news report? I’m taking parents get first shots tmrw (Moderna) can’t wait. Today, three managers (also seniors) work got shots today. consolation, 2 year olds remember much, anything. sucks experience her, impacted it. I’m still confused haven’t put guidance priority list covid fall. US 25 million cases covid-19. That’s gotta least 10-20 million people don’t need top vaccination priority list. would obviously depend risk profile, time since infection, contact covid patients, etc., anything reach herd immunity quickly possible least considered. keep hearing guidance still get vaccine you’ve infected feel like probably people need more, least, probably don’t need two doses. love Super bowl morons probably gonna give us another little bump. got St. Patty’s morons next month. yeah took minute process title trying figure vaccinations cases bad.

Eventually realized positive milestone! 450k dead since time last year. Stop playing party politics. There’s tag 2 weeks vaccine rate, could expect fairly normal year around mid-late summer assuming general population gets vaccinated around April-June (based Massachusetts covid vaccination rollout, expect around states.)  Better find somebody immediate area though, case like ya enough wanna actually bang things safer. sad downvoted that.

95% greater 65%, people need understand ""95% X"" ""65% Y"", X things.  lol remember getting senior portrait taken, indoors people getting picture taken told take masks off, pen laptop sanitized every single time someone touched lmao. hold laughter entire time bc theater. Lol. stopped reading “both sides” Yeah thing since we’ve shown get functional vaccines timely manner it’s matter updating vaccines. It’s like vaccine technology go away especially mRNA vaccines ramp scale it’ll trivial put new update. might need treat like flu shot I’m honestly worried next winter.  flu doesn’t mortality rate COVID. It’s also contagious. Imagine didn’t take steps mitigate impact, think would be? 

You’re concerned bars shutting down... think underlying issues need address. I’m support need it. remember really happy makes happy well. think looking back best memories family vacations. Finally getting good news Don’t even go dating app. There’s countless subs dedicated lmao  nmmy state   people complaining snowstorm cutting vaccine numbers Northeast seem forget major weather event keeping people inside also cut infections actual concern? Agreed! He’s chasing regular paid interview gig. Besides predicts comes true he’s genius. doesn’t nobody remember anyway. I’m getting first shot tomorrow too! Cheers! :) !Remindme 34 days  College weird me, since 60% close median grade STEM classes, *everything* curved (because lets professors write harder tests - writing tests everyone get 90% better challenge anyone). grad school meant anything less B failing grade could get someone kicked out.

All numbers need context. easy 60% 95% numbers lot baggage make directly comparable, many media types ignoring baggage favor pithy headlines. Yeah I’m starting really fear much anything. amygdala enough. understanding, don’t believe currently capable exercising personal responsibility? that’s case, would politely disagree. burden personal responsibility placed individual start. Obviously, impossible initial impression whole COVID thing. now, it’s taken much seriously. Sure, dummies, shouldn’t stop rest country retaining personal liberties. Especially representatives public figures, sides, can’t meet standard set everyone else. notion incapable exercising personal responsibility, given informed are, insulting. ‘greater populations safety health’ goes, shit load evidence suggests tighter restrictions little stop spread virus. Furthermore, government take opportunity get bigger perpetuating lie need government survive. Either way, it’s definitely balance don’t think either side done well maintaining. Haseltine saying organization’s website couple months. think Forbes picked one pieces couple weeks ago. quoted Yahoo. Now...cnn. $$$$$ Neat didn’t know *before* trump, yikes. Oh goodness yes. would terribly inconvenient / terrifying. It’s fun feeling takes recover full lights out. 😓 I'm dissapoined US people die last week Canada past year combined. Hoping vaccine rollouts happen everyone though! sudden grateful vagal faint loo. feel awful folks faint potty. hasn’t going planned. kinds vaccine shortages. It’s news literally every night. kids way. want take baseball game bad! really doubt locking air travel stalled spread: Actually 95k hospitalizations! Exciting! There's plenty studies past years taking advil tylenol impact vaccines immune system responding them. data place appear impact much. I've received shots. took advil first shot. second shot, immune system responded knocked ass 24 hours. 

It hurt immune system tip top condition people bit overcautious this. Several large medical organizations reccomend taking ibuprofen side effects covid vaccines. What? eli5 me. Sorry thank pregnancy test Doom?  lead pockets bad, even refuse vaccinations contributing herd immunity one way another.

The problem definitely people international stuff, moment less developed world going dealing 2022. Yeah! given dexamethasone pregnant (they feared preterm labor) blood sugar went 180 😱    Fascinating. clarify I’ve received official diagnosis, that’s tuning obvious common causes like diabetes blood pressure problems. identical twin sister issue, started teenagers. 🤷🏻‍♀️ It’s never serious enough seek official diagnosis get laying down. don’t find blood draws particularly painful either, something experience makes go thump floor. Heh.   least double awful attitude guy complain choice made. He's one sounds rueful situation. Let’s like Asia... Well take example. observe 2 severe side effects 10,000 patients. vaccine cause pure chance? observe placebo arm, people would even expect see it? think vaccine caused it, many people think would get 100 million people? worth canceling whole thing maybe restricting use less likely occur? wanted restrict can't get vaccine? gets fuzzier introduce time.

100 people placebo group get sick, five people vaccine group get sick, five vaccine group 49 day mark. *prove* vaccine 100% effective 49 days? No, suggestive certain point severe cases placebo group.

We *do* know there's lengthy ramp-up period vaccines. Microbiology transitioning another field due stupid decisions part thinking ex I's future. pan out. I've free time read find love science again.  


I would inclined agree witness three variants 17 thru 23 mutations randomly. Either way, sobering situation we've found in, it? That’s fucking leadership action! first dose, hardly felt it, arm pain couple days afterwards. think second dose knocks people out. Good luck us both. serious conversation without antagonizing people making sarcastic commentary. I’m willing that, choose to, guess i’m loss.  mitigation strategies given diagnosed VV syncope via tilt table test. painful things = fainting upright presyncope, laying down. handle needles blood draws ok though. personally actually think it’s better use adenovirus vector don’t since means future vaccines rely won’t work you. still phase 1A though? I'm 1A tier already ran vaccines could get one. need deploy FEMA already. medical training, work medical field volunteer? 

I would totally work days, exchange early access vaccine  make sound like disinformation rare thing. expecting headline typo “bottles” supposed “battles”, really bottles! Specifically shatter-resistant glass used Corning make 70% world’s vaccine vials (as well many fantastic materials). company makes Gorilla Glass used smartphone screens, btw! I’m fan Corning used many products lab.

I wonder we'll *get* kits summer. need lot 19 million per month. Michael Mina big advocate rapid tests. IIRC, estimated 100 million Americans need test least twice week make dent covid. That's 800 million tests/month.

The significance announcement Ellume gotten EUA FDA, hopefully companies -- hopefully companies **much larger manufacturing capacity**. Yep. approved December. saw news December, website said would available purchase sometime February March. Thank god president get shiat done!

Either way I'm happy feels like we're starting fight back know people laughed paranoid virus last January already received first vaccine dose continue wait wait. Crazy things work out. hated Trump administration, said, can’t good conscience give credit Biden’s presidency. vaccinations taken place put motion Biden inaugurated.   doctor. health department, probably sign page website. Look nurse I’m gonna argue getting paid more. sub ridiculous acting like get nothing work every day. made 65k one year outta college working 36 hours/3days week. 

Literally I’m on, routinely schedule 5+ days row make decent money

Then travel nurses. One buddies made 230k year travel nurse wait general populating gets access. Probably April/May. June wouldn’t surprising.    official data  Ireland ICU admissions start drop quickly 75 years. However, UK, number people ICUs increases 80 drops off. Interesting see contrast, wonder much influenced lower ICU capacity. Sweden even lower capacity us, due staffing shortages got worse past years. know Bangalore special zone India.

like relatively clean city there. That’s good true actually. Less asymptotic means easier track got vaccine way! volunteer hospice I’m 33, perfect health. I’ve doses now, feel incredibly lucky. debated taking dose someone deserving, decided end day, I’m part stop spread. Good luck! (I zero reactions either shot, sore arm!) What’s implemented? words, higher J&amp;J Astrazeneca. Less Pfizer, Moderna Novavax. thought cough symptom. considering 40% fewer new cases 2 weeks ago number steady decline, increasingly clear R less 1 presently, USA throughout world matter. might surprised! fully prepared feel like shit second shot, felt totally fine. Good luck!  they’re fully approved yet Nope, double mask equal double ""good"" protection. better way think two bad masks add equal one good mask. Get real NIOSH certified mask. Cover another mask like, matter. go walking around two cloth masks think well protected single N95/KF94/KN95. answer? People don’t want work nursing homes. It’s literally one worst jobs country. even exaggerating. Oh boy. someone literally works field, doubt things go back “normal” anytime soon, least years.

Completely new different vaccine technology. That's like surprised electric cars use gas. dull moments ""did see Facebook"" I'm like care. FB.

Bliss. mean complicated. people taken science class since 17. Many others subreddit probably *are* 17. explain mom week mRNA vaccines still work new variants. arguing bad faith, read articles thought saying vaccines 6x less effective, thing thought actually researched further.

I also think genuine bad faith anti-vaxxers downvoted/banned pretty quickly. really opposite problem I've noticed. top comments every thread aggressively saying good news means pandemic completely over, anyone thinks still need take precautions/not immediately reopen 100% horrible person. We're nowhere near woods here, need acknowledge that. Also, coincidence many people making arguments months long comment histories COVID truther subreddits. weird, noticeable shift subreddit last weeks. Debbie downer could long bigger first wave given population size. said vaccines get fast enough prevent second talk side effects? someone family there: they’re both. mean specialist one replace right away, there’s much ado nothing? Yes could wear mask inside inside 8 hours next someone makes mask prevention negligible anyway Playbook - open drive thru testing sites.
Let dust settle see variants remain require new vaccine, all. Someone make N95 masks widely available. year almost... Never forget. Never. Forget. Yeah, got 1 727. That's actually impressive. would get credit scientific achievements Fuck wanting article read, right.. Haha fair enough. laughing saw article pointing articles praising Biden vaccinations per day already knew conclusion going thread Soooo....4 years bullshit ey?

mRNA-in-lipids adenovirus vaccines operate exactly way, manufactured differently; present SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins surface blob fatty lipids. difference mRNA ones use artificially made lipid cell structures whilst adenovirus ones use weaker, inactivated (the code reproduce removed) virus carrier: still carry (at least portion of) RNA virus they're targeting.

The presence spike proteins immune system notices, adapts producing antigens bind shape _those spike proteins_. inactivated viral vector used much muchness.

We adenovirus influenza vaccines, used thoroughly vaccinate Ebola, Green Book say either vaccine contraindication vaccines.

If ChAdOx rendered future adenovirus vector vaccines useless, recommended take second dose 28 days (with potential booster shots later on)! tell main reason think Israel, 3M vaccinated, seems several errors happened people got whole vial single dose meant 5 people. approve vial contain extra 5 doses more, could much harmful. far half dozen cases saw progress anything serious. even get vaccinated reguler person comment linking nypost.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Yes discriminating 80 year olds 30 year olds case, may warranted. Ageism commonly understood mean unwarranted discrimination based age. So, good reason believe 80 year olds higher death rate 30 year olds, no, choosing vaccination 80 year olds ageist. worries, it’s actually interesting works. Basically piece mRNA allows cells build COVID spike protein. immune system recognizes foreign develops antibodies prevent infection later on. Fascinating stuff, first time done. takes blame politicizing wearing masks, lying virus, silencing officials, limiting PPE states, flagrantly ignoring safety protocols rallys events, coherent rollout plan vaccines, etc. Also issue production, distribution. average states needled 50-60% people compared doses physically state, rumor go drive-thru vaccination clinic passenger somebody getting it, they'll vaccinate anyways finally winning! Perhaps little open minded wouldn’t problem! 😉  Wasn’t Sweden admitting many elderly people ICU giving palliative care instead? remember discussion scandal investigation refusal admit patients. Oh lol. way someone explained oops Honestly pharmacist get love should. Pharmacist mixed chemo killed leukemia. pharmacist noticed potentially fatal drug interaction got doctor phone get antibiotic worked interact heart meda chemo. people can't handle truth still isn’t going anywhere near fast enough? me, I'd continue regular precautions, feeling much relieved even get sick, vaccine prevent serious. I'd probably feel ok hang around vaccinated friends like normal. aren’t antibodies vaccine guy Yay, it! over! Oh man, went Peppa Pig playground Feb last year. Mine four now, wanna take back still likes she’s grown now. Yep aggressively happening *every single thread*, especially Good News ones. done highly unconstructive antagonistic way. becoming insufferable Well good, there’s problem, things going planned.

There's need make bottles adamantium. previous vaccines humanity used worked fine regular chemical glass. yes, freeze -80 C warm back without issues. I’m right you. Got mine 8:30 yesterday morning. 16 hours arm little sore nothing else far. Kinda getting little nervous friends told their’s hit them
pretty suddenly get behind building codes requiring ventilation reduce viral spread, chorus inherently social activity, nobody go along standing 12 feet apart singing. People want social distancing engaging social activities over.

As long everyone gets flu vaccines, cold flu season worst annoyance years, simply worth social cost continually treat friends like they’re dangerous breathing, even case right particular instance.  vaccine   guess literally long response try type gets immediately removed facts political now. Yay!  ...You cannot honestly believe Trump’s administration reason ramp up...  phrase disgustingly overused pandemic ... except particular case regarding number vaccinations administered; pretty much entire rest world catch US. body better pop fucking blue bubbles  I’ve noticed same. Lots ignorant showboating type comments. 

We want end  pretty sure 99.9 percent people wearing masks airports. everytime airport, people wearing masks..I get media highlights one anti-mask man. people good wearing masks airport. understand Biden administration still ramping vaccination distribution data, right? plan place heavily Trump administration's.  

No need dishonesty.  
Good news good news. Lol even normal times. However, movie theaters area reopening I'll getting second dose early March, able (safely) go see Godzilla vs Kong! Well adapt couple days, it’s regulatory process would bottleneck countries working speed since would alterations. get rid approval process would getting Pfizer vaccines October

In likelihood vaccine infrastructure stay place time we’re giving credit Biden vaccinations administration needs blamed deaths new cases well? conflate criticism Biden support Donald Trump.

Too many ppl seem get part fucked up. required before? 1 year late Alright fair enough. NSAIDs ones I've ever warned about. call '45 instead name? personal feelings outrage mask wearing extreme opinions sides issue. work read disseminate research aerosolization clear body evidence masks absolutely help reduce number aerosolized droplets space.  


That said, help substantially coupled social distancing, also know lot spread occurs homes family close friends. Stop listening bullshit. many least mean well, pretty clear vast majority experts well heads understanding event complex one. Yet still savoring spotlight want relinquish time soon. moderating weird, I've said far less comment removed. They're specialist whose patient position risk, strict quarantine policy patient exposed, they're allowed they'd really want kind need know patients name experience multiple family members, one reach you. reach county. website probably wait list phone number Unless report week. weird conversation I'll try one health experts considered psychology, behavioral traits, compliance, Government enforcement, geography, laws, etc...

You shifted ""health"" experts, guess getting closer?

But still talking decisions rely wider expertise considerations. expect health experts shoulder responsibility enforcement knowledge legal knowledge. Back February/March everyone thought Covid spreads like Ebola, droplets fomites. [leaders known virus actually spreads aerosols since January, decided lie everyone political droplet based guidelines precautions stuck one seems care enough update protect aerosols. wonder reopening economy ""safely"" always causes spike cases 🤦‍♀️ Oh, make tons money stockholders. pay workers often require wo multiple sites avoid full time egirs overtime pay. Oh goodness same. first child born end February 2020, maternity leave even went quarantine. family super careful met family barely seen outside home. expected life like hope hope hope get soon. forgot word “clobbered”. Good word, gotta use more. Thank saying this. I’m actually cna (post acute care, got stuck long term care unit) defended vaccine coworkers good one one convos it. Everyone shift got vaccinated. Studies show one one conversations like combat vaccine hesitancy threatening people consequences. psyched shot made sure everyone around knew elated get too. still wear got covid vaccinated sticker badge right next flu shot one. 

It’s thankless job required everyone vaccinated, we’d go under. We’re running nearly constantly understaffed many people quit. took job hated sales office work, I’m already looking getting ASAP. Mistrust medical establishment among women minorities real reason, traditionally gotten shit end stick. experimented receiving dangerous treatments wouldn’t surprise anyone coworkers reusing n95 masks year. Since fact still reuse ppe shows one gives fuck us. guess grandma wouldn’t anyone helping get thru hip surgery recovery without us. 

So people sub, instead yelling “you shouldn’t healthcare then!” bunch people society facility calling “heroes” treating us like trash nearly year leu paying us real danger we’ve put god forbid actually real shut down, shove ass. hate anti-vacciners too! instead vilifying hard working poor people maybe complain truly broken education system people come fundamentally understand science scientific research. Ask RN tell CNA’s backbone healthcare system. one tired shit come home everyday sore feet cry sometimes lonely patients want see families again. amount selfishness I’ve seen past year makes want live woods become RN. Stop blaming individuals start questioning system made way. countries domestic manufacturers vaccines want get populace vaccinated first exporting. UK US Germany advantage powerful pharmaceutical industries. Actually, reaction second shot often stronger reaction first. Congrats quitting smoking!

The biggest risk lowers efficacy vaccine. sounds scary, even partial protection better protection, especially got risk factors severe COVID. Wait least 2 weeks bar hopping karaoke 😀 think you’ll fine then! I’ve covid read affects people more, antibodies jab antibodies body little fight pretty good.  confused Dr. Lin Gupta, gone deep end. buy $GME! Biden's team done, also done. lack lies BS surely helping things run smoothly would otherwise. True single dose already pretty good. hero! underlying assumption we're stupid make personal assessments risk need scared following advice. SAGE UK [literally government needed inundate people ""emotional"" messaging frighten compliance. one people wash hands bathroom you? Wow idea went big! could buy people employed neighboring states getting shot article all, cross country hell even cross national borders!

Thanks article. I’m full hope we’ll see big diffrence soon hospitalizations deaths, focus entirely elders. total number cases may change much right away 65 got yet get soon... least serious cases typically oldest citizens fall considerably. varies much. I've heard people say doses knocked asses. Others said second dose knocked ass. Others said experienced zero symptoms.

10 hours since stuck first dose far...nothing.  yeah. mentioned they're already booster variants. mid-january Stupid part? that? literally everywhere lol Holy sh*t fast! Nice one America! I’m hairdresser dealing antimaskers day.. please get vaccine already.. scary times world.. political comments also really suck! several older clients who’ve shots now.. funny.. haven’t grown third eye extra limbs.  Teacher 🙋🏻‍♀️ district scheduled us get first round Pfizer vaccine Thursday. thrilled one step closer students back classroom! Honestly accomplish? It’s drinking me. nightcap night next night. I’ll try stay dry second dose. Here’s hoping feel like shit! feel you. I’m technically young (under 40) immunocompromised, there’s news I’ll get it. figure I’ll probably get virus die first get me. Get point jog please Damn. That's insane concerning. gyms requires disinfect surfaces use? Wait last word mean again? ... Normal? Huh, forget Keep up! feel empowering tangible positive impact work.  helped recently assisting health care organization vaccine information roll really gratifying do.  2021 showing improvement sure. damn debate covid during!!!!! Nope. I’m despairing moment. taking long ramp up? Sorry live stupid part country. ignorance everywhere. Hopefully they'll see light. elevator panel cases could infected aerosols. There's way prove cases got infected touching panels. cases people contracted virus took elevator minutes infected person. could easily exposed virus aerosols (aerolos linger air 3 hours). Finally, decently positive news. Even Fall would late, feel. Proper mask rollout begun Feb/March, like every country world doing. Genuinely surprised. ""J.O.S. Justice system joke case numbers explode winter southern hemisphere? NZ control Australia. Admittedly, Melbourne get second wave mid-winter localised Melbourne, rest State didn't. everyone refuses wear mask, going get everyone test take appropriate action after?  mean, time article posted we've already crossed 4 million.

So doordash/grubhuh take dine kind allowed know EU forced countries follow? Norway joined program willingly, EU members may done well. nice! state?  That’s supply schedule states, tribes, territories. that, supply distribution hands federal government. Even health care providers thing. Like saving supply ensure 2nd dose. 

What Biden aggressive purchasing doses. hasn’t really president long EO week ago. think distribution become efficient since start year, applaud local counties states. Got year end (lunar) party Friday three weddings weekend madness Tet Vietnam.  No, saying consider evidence given. theory evidence something happening.   follow Osterholm, Biden’s advisor topic might find sobering useful information. predictions prescient. wrote book years unbelievably spot on.

And using outlier number claim trend?

We 0.3-0.4 million vaccinations per day. ITAR, doubt ever see. Probably helps Biden actually working listens Fauci.

Im really beginning think Trump's COVID response wasnt really applauded world leaders. /s Remember take money development administration buy enough, lost track millions vaccines, seized medical supplies auctioned friends cost states taxes? Sounds awful, I'm glad gyms open! Can't wait super high risk mom dad get vaccinated get dorm without feeling like I'm going kill insist visiting University every week. love I've barely left dorm apartment entire school year got feeling lonely. saying lockdown skeptics anti-vax? seen that, generally.

Going gym...

That's it, know, super exciting /s.  boss informed today cases continue drop vaccination keeps going is, good chance reopen fully sometime mid late March early April restrictions USA here. work, they’ve got cleaning people “fogging” areas disinfectant daily. You’re supposed go areas half hour it, even then, find extremely hard breathe spending time areas hours spray. 

Still better doing. Covid cleaning measures started, wiping everything pure bleach. Five employees diagnosed chemical induced breathing problems stopped. get mine? I'm essential, elderly/weak. there's clinical trial this. Researchers collecting data actual vaccine rollout, taking time get enough data CDC actually issue recommendation this. also sensitive issue 1) effectively de-prioritizing people 2) cases Covid may may officially confirmed PCR test. Good. makes happy. Give another two weeks flatten curve :) really got two plans week

1. Go classes 

2. Hold GME AMC shares, blast moon. Yeah, read Trump vaccine supply super erratic; clinics would get 3000 doses one week 300 next. Biden made 3 week schedule known vaccine supply. lol im high dude leave alone  apparently common, things like vaccination blood draw really social event usually obvious people condition, doctors nurses.

The world knew may over. I’m envious. Enjoy low risk freedom! mean COVID literally attacks elderly primary voting base...  You’re probably fine. Covid behaves like almost every disease immune systems build natural immunity it. It’s unlikely could get covid twice.

Vaccines make immune response stronger naturally developed immunity, body developed pretty robust immune response own.

Dude it, it. Don’t try change reality instead take precautions around well yourself. logic. scientific fact. Technically correct, dont think understand whole evolutionary pressure context therefore make wrong general conclusions. Let explain.

Viruses bacteria mutate time. Bacteria usually mutate less often, DNA - double stranded helix self fixing properties (so basically 2 copies genetic information prevents mistakes copying, kinda like 2 hard drives RAID 1), viruses usually RNA, single chain genetic information, usually without ability fix mistakes (mutations). Even though mutation rate viruses like covid considered less often, fact trillions viral particles world means mutations happen many times second.

So covid mutating time around, documented 12 thousand different covid mutations. BUT, extremely unlikely mutation beneficial virus. 99.999...9% mutations ""break"" virus dies disappears. Kinda like humans, many genetic mutations know positive human, many become genetic diseases....). beginning one strain covid virus bat, thanks positive mutation able infect humans. late 2019 strain started infected people kept mutating. said mutations gave virus disadvantages died off. rarely mutations give virus benefits, like able quickly enter cells, longer incubation period, higher chance causing asymptomatic cases, increase shedding therefore viral load person caughs out, etc... mutations better world old strain, become dominant strain area thanks evolutionary pressure. continue mutating on...

So question kinda correct, sounds like assume virus cannot mutate stronger strains indefinitely. truth course does. UK South African variants keep mutating speak, sooner later emerge dangerous mutated form virus lower efficacy vaccines natural protection people already original covid strain. important quickly globally vaccinate whole world, huge number viral particles world, able mutate strain able resist vaccines previous natural immunity. 

Even looks like new variants lower vaccine efficiency 10%, 10% vaccinated people still get sick. huge. give virus time people (or animals, remember Denmakr's minks?) hosts mutate, keep becoming infectious people infected much easier, increasing exponencial curve spread. necessarily mean new strains less deadly, virus cares infecting many people can, infect twice many people, care already kills twice many people. talking virus becoming weaker false, generally virus less deadly, infect people, example mutation makes infect twice many people, become dominant strain even kill 20% people. Almost everyone gets mild moderate infection. view dangerous warped media picks rare horrible cases - sensationalism gets clicks. Age much, much bigger factor obesity. End Feb maybe Commissioners elected.

This obvious piece misinformation getting real old. European Council proposes candidate the European Commission President, taking account elections the European Parliament held appropriate consultations. Members the European Council vote qualified majority. Then, European Parliament elects. Hold on. anyone vaccination now? seen people US same, people minds.com sharing template print fake vaccine document. AZ/Oxford vaccine produced licence world bunch different trade names.

Ironically, vaccine produced 3rd party (Serum Institute) South Africa paying per dose EU bought directly AZ. Username checks It’s super simple person planet matters, care anyone else, gets complicated. evidence people vaccinated still become infected covid spread virus, even vaccine protects severe illness. Basically, still wear mask socially distance everyone vaccinated. make filling process faster, also able distribute easier. truly win-win situation. Anyway it’s wonderful hear filling bottleneck. means least production liquid going well. No, far vaccines also effective new strains. work. They'll access roads stead Hot damn! That’s awesome ! Finland biggest group intensive care 55-70 years-old (mostly) men. age group gets prioritizes 75 years old people. Men never mentioned risk group. certain areas etnic groups.

Then again, told again, main reason restrictions overstrain healtcare system intensive care, particular, beyond capacity. vaccine could but, instead, plan roll particular order (after 75 year olds certain smallish groups). Read carefully. response merely pointed many doses poster assigning first doses would given second doses. That’s pessimistic supported evidence. got covid 3 week ago I'm tested negative, still need get vaccinated like everyone body fine already antibody? One thing trickles effectively leadership. Bad leaders stick everything. wonder cases go 1 country love guy cryptocurrencies looks stupid, traveling Dubai Mexico city. people first clase safe pass using mask? Let's assume right. need herd immunity open economy. OK. need open economy? 

Believe me, even Germany, lot money solid state support anybody situation absolutely crazy. moment answer get ""lockdown patience, patience lockdown"". 

In Germany old people continue die: according vaccination schedule, 80+ group(top prio!) scheduled bis end March, i.e. full protection May. I'm sure gone April. Like miracle. That's true. I've read anti-maskers Alberta, also ton cases due getting virus Americans.  So, guess get back self-isolation containers, DoorDash Netflix end time? “I’m going grandmas tomorrow lunch. Maybe take test safe.”

“I really want hang friend drink beers smoke weed night catch up, would unsafe. don’t want part problem. take test, eliminating risk. Let’s blow lines Like it’s 2019!” 

I used spend $60 Ubers night going out. 

Why not? guess Biden's measures positive effect (like requiring masks public transit)

You mean mandate go effect later today? Also virtually every public transit already required mask. Planes did, airports did, trains did, buses did, Uber did, Lyft did. say federal government enforce it, company local authority. office cleaner would come every day wipe door handles. ‘That’s us safe another day’ previous guy gets blame new guy gets credit? Every health authority around world said virus still pretty much unknown masks short supply people hoarding everything could get hands on. logic universal vaccine. program attack cancer next week? Serious question ? 

Why buy fake ? complicated take previous test change date ? can’t talk re-opening society even full vaccine rollout, would irresponsible. People might die. keep current measures place one ever dies again.  

This guy posted completely sensible logical comment gets downvoted. despair place.

I know Reddit fucked, logic gets downvoted. armies bots spreading disinformation lies. please form opinion Reddit, seek sources thoughts. Biden told us would get worse gets better getting better. would lie? Anyone know vaccinations low February 1st (Monday)? snow storm? grubhub deals boggie? remember people saying would June 

who? dude recently vacated white house? there's big difference someone like saying there's reason optimism vs. scientists. like said sure thing but...it's better nothing  Oh, know ""how"" wear mask, adults continue toddlers want wear mask all. pretty simple thing do. Codagenix, astrazeneca/ox, imperial (not partnered yet) trialed, trial US UoB vaccine got put pause FDA , smaller trials HK Selfish rael Everyone know got got mild cold mild flu, even young. Mid 30s absolutely idea I'm even I'm ever getting mine UK. still even finished older people yet. government's plan absurdly slow. Granted there's logistical challenges fucking hard organize million shots small island get vaccinating majority population 60. cops died capitol.  They’ll get it. really many jump ship jobs.   I'd like think majority people reasonable. Unfortunately reasonable ones also people go around social media sharing typing storms vaccines, probably seem like there's way anti-vaxxers are. That's theory anyways haha. would hope FDA could turn around approve next day. I’m sure won’t. bureaucracy maddening. miserable need realistic though - people UK reportedly dying catching Covid already 1 2 shots Pfizer vaccine.

Granted they're old vulnerable, still. vaccine showing signs ""not working"" already, though likely specific cases.

HOWEVER. different people dying Flu yearly flu jab(s) part parcel human - vaccines guaranteed work, even effectiveness 90%.

Most likely negativity fear mongering usual news. surprised availability well! wife killing it! Keep up! interesting, apart terrifying, see various appointees would either actively subvert mission agency appointed to, use position personal gain, both.

Ultimately though, matter Covid especially. refused address situation much publicly first couple months knew pursued trade negotiations China, lying numbers US cases. came travel ban, ineptly applied led tons new cases coming country. pitted states PPE ventilators FEMA trying intercept seize states' shipments. that's within first months 2020.

My post removed wrote convinced evidence yet. course, two shot vaccine work, we're looking here. Ludicrous behaviour mod, complete stifling critical thought. enough around willing work wages offered. now? 1 million day literally already hit Trump's administration, always amazes divisive American politics Great response. Thanks efforts injecting scientific sanity 

 emotional 'in defence cloroxing' perspectives often found threads like ate understandable really benefit rational 'debunking' sometimes, even people want hear brings comfort . informed better equipped deal outbreaks present future good EU monitoring vaccine exports, happy pharmaceutical companies exist, nobody expect wanting make maximum profit. made way end basically without contracting damn virus. dad stepmom live go partying wolf lifted 3 week restriction brought home infected everyone. close. think you’re misunderstanding whatever evolutionary law you’re trying apply 

A virus isn’t like mammal needs evolve kill prey efficiently. viruses life cycle type organism is, requires host/vector reproduction. Remember reproduction drives evolution. virus mutated become lethal evolutionarily *dis*advantageous less time proliferate spread. Ideally, virus would like non-lethal, highly transmissible infection last long time, things foster greater viral reproduction. Killing vector faster would make sense idk. trust Australian article China sound like morons, dont think Robert di Nero Jenny McArthy jfk Jr. morons injecting random shit internet, good deflection use associationism though. There's way earth everything fine beyond April. EU next winter. Current EU projections 70% adults vaccinated September. That's adults, including children enough herd immunity mean guess makes sense although wouldn’t call person tortured logic. Telling someone tortured logic kind ridiculous thing say. right though. plan TECHNICALLY plan. Bravo good sir. managed prove point insulting time. past now. little brits tiny little island importing exporting vaccines, everything you. real question, one importance talking way Chinese numbers super low non existent either calling bs even bringing up? seems mind blowing me. read several times I’m used us done something good Moderna Pfizer vaccine effective South African British variant one took hold Wuhan. Gonna try watch entirety Richard Linklater's filmography I'm pretty sure OP saying vaccines would come quicker. They're probably hinting leader Trump (even different republican less.. cult-ish?.. dictatorship-lite? Generally stupid?) would resulted country handling pandemic better first place.

Faster travel bans (opposed late ones targeted asians *way late*). Quicker lockdowns better support enforcement said lockdowns, less anti-mask false-cure spouting, less covid death parties, etc.

Instead hundreds thousands dead, we'd likely looking *maybe* tens thousands. 

They're praising Biden. They're shit-talking Trump. Welcome ""mass adoption anything"". People want reinforce biases told think, effort involved. Like imagine New York Times talks ""the 5 vaccines"" 19 Phase 3 status 5 according WHO...but leave either Chinese Russian... understand redditors biased New York Times? C\`mooooon LOL. 

Here link full sheet going max length doses (12 weeks) still getting efficacy waiting 3-4 weeks. would love know scientific answer can’t imagine 1 year (or 1.5 years) avoiding people going counter 30+ years already put filthy person building immune system. could totally wrong. hope though. live fuckin america, bigger always better.
Send it. Thank you. shit makes blood boil. media time. Lead scary story bury science like that. Try stress. age hospitalization good precaution monitor him. culture mask wearing.  Taiwan island culture wasp wearing.

Well, case, Europeans can't put piece cloth faces save compatriots, bother saving all? chances waste used within time.

Also less waste space freezers/ fridges, fewer trucks, etc. Could positive called overfill. easy handle small amount liquid since tends stick sides container rather pool bottom. serious getting every single drop vials would centrifuging something collect one place. 


You also want put many doses one bottle want many doses wasted drop something. Hence avoid putting 50 doses bottle. guess go figure 5 good number overfill 6 expectation probably can't get 6th dose out. hope so, remember articles listing July US timeline ahead EU one.

Here France, trust government manage September knows. going gym staying 6 feet away everyone constantly mask going spread Virus faster someone going overcrowded walmart black Friday... believe steps taken 2020 - distancing, masks, etc. - necessary? comments seem indicate not. one completely different?

The answer really fundamental... virus mean similar.. flu (influenza) COVID-19 (coronavirus) considered together, different viruses (core issue ""it's flu""). Ebola even farther apart since respiratory illness transmitted via bodily fluids (so yes, clean surfaces dealing Ebola); end, masks important compared COVID-19 terms transmission means (but almost important given Ebola much worse disease catch it). 

Your question also phrased: masks? previous coronaviruses (SARS, MERS) transmissible via air. 

Each reviewed data comes it.... reason big shift masks, data came much easier COVID spread via air compared viruses (both influenza coronavirus). yeah, virus listen stop infecting! come nobody thought \-and- -never- actually part pandemic plans. Precisely reasons discussing uptake huge, though: old folks miss hugs. developed yearly flu vaccine protect vulnerable. And, speaking teacher, every winter large flu outbreaks would regularly shut entire school districts state several days time. wife’s old church back home brags much extra money spending deep cleaning keep safe every time I’m forced watch live stream. Yet don’t require masks seated, course one wear them. thank goodness “mandated” masks 30 seconds people walk inside seats. sit 90 minutes screaming tongues pastor asks money tells god bless won’t let get Covid. yes, they’ve multiple outbreaks including pastors family rest staff “leadership” retreat Gatlinburg together. Vietnam though. contracts capacity. EU biggest capacities (76%) exporting Canada, Israel, Mexiko, Singapur, many UK (that's reason able start early). Question say can't get covid surfaces, guys coming back grocery shopping? Actually get grocery delivered, get plastic bags use purell hands, put away fridge. wipe door handle. first days handling packages/grocery would  sparingly use purell again. need those? coz can't get surface? guys shopping food delivery. waste? I’m US. show fever we’re banned work 2 weeks ‘precaution’. got flu shot fall took temperature leaving work, sure enough fever. reported would miss one day instead missing 2 weeks.

I’m guessing covid vaccine day similar me.

Actually, might say fuck get 2 week unpaid vacation  island helps. Probably depends region/your living situation. NYC, it’s huge PITA get tested even though it’s free places walk-up only, end wasting half day waiting around slot. Also, really hard get tested around holidays like Christmas/Thanksgiving since anyone who’s planning visit family tries get tested close departure date possible.

My insurance covers LabCorp Pixel tests, it’s *so* much less hassle. However, still mail lab - home test kits sound especially convenient since sounds like keep hand take one whenever need it. Bloomberg update: total. 1.0M doses yesterday vs 1.1M last Monday, 9%. Rolling average slightly 1.35M 1.34M. Ya..it's scary situation good reason keep media reality situation far worse general public lead believe. 

You correct tackle one problem time keep hope one day get mess sorted meantime I'm moving cottage one thing I'm certain of..this year.    conspiracy? Lmao read article? really sound like U.K. obligation provide anything. would already contractually stated. teachers fucked. becoming increasingly evident people gotten one mRNA based vaccines unlikely transmit virus.  Vaccinating teachers means schools likely open fall could open sooner say killed 10,000 people day happened unless died day happened. could say indirectly killed 10,000 people years later, confirmed. 

But beside point. take action prevent lives lost better Healthcare economic stimulus. contrast, everyone going business usual would led hundreds housands lives lost due COVID-19, we've absolutely made right choice here.  nice. confusing time doomcrew. vaccine killing people latch onto one case nurse happened faint live television. also posted answered via dm.

You absolutely pre-vaccine rules removed shot. 

We need like 70% population vaccinated start vague type normal start return. us probably still wearing masks time next year. live here, know people, city one longest lockdowns planet people stayed firm.
Don't project thoughts, opinions whacko conspiracies onto people know understand.
We living close normal lives, hospitals quiet, come go please Covid largely something happens people parts world.
Was lockdown worth pain?
You bet arse was. That's said ""only kind biased"" instead ""not biased"" they're ones worried about, especially immuno deficient vaccine work you... Well, least found common ground (:

High school definitely 100% stay online until... Well, honestly know. either adults vaccinated, maybe high schoolers vaccinated, realize might stretch. No, fact opposite true: vaccine -- mRNA -- proven reduce deaths C-19. confidence intervals vaccines include 0% decrease. favour stay away Toronto then. subway service 1:30 even pre-corona 😔 makes say that? definitely immunocompromised old people trials

Regardless, 0 hospitalizations five vaccines prob means fine. sure you’re referring narrative like isn’t real concern. would voluntarily sign permanent heart damage, guest. Better me. 

I don’t see rush reopen semblance herd immunity. It’s already year. What’s another months? Yeah, I’m sure absolutely every possible activity dollars associated allowed nothing it. Bloomberg updated.

I got giggle. getting sketchy Russian vaccine week. I’m worried gonna lie. Since saying won't, probably means preparing so. Go, Polish brothers sisters! Fight freedom! kicked Nazies, kicked Soviets! kick lockdownists! vaccinating teachers meant school would really reopen would advocated phase 1. sure aren’t going reopen fall  Why? testing still free available area.

It's nightmare waiting line hours NYC we're February, pleasant. deterred getting tested several times luckily I'm socializing double mask buy groceries/run errands week, I'm worried spreading anyone. at-home test would Godsend. know love streaming services - new shows don’t take time slots others. old days puff piece would take 2-hour time blocks two separate days. Waste time money. Everyone get it. Solution dead space problem: discard needles only, reuse syringes. contaminated way needles are. would problem that?  comes vaccination I'm solidly opinion let perfect enemy good. Give priority aged working certain highly-exposed positions somebody gets vaccine early fine, still help cut viral spread better vaccine going waste.

Some people absolutely take advantage ""accidentally"" warm extra vials give family friends. people suck, think worth slowing entire vaccine rollout try avoid done perfectly order. Nobody screaming anyone here. scream? invent things, help argument certainly help people take seriously.

Please make coherent argument. reply say ""my point kids suffering"" go list complaints issues deal career personal suffering. it, concerned kids suffering? see listing personal complaints like ending career, schedule unstable, etc. actual concern children arguments?

Watching people orange vests spraying shit down... *Feels good man.* still suspicion accepted 60% efficacy figure regular Covid pessimistic doses spaced apart. MHRA came conclusion higher efficacy (90%) patients mistakenly received half dose regiment actually due larger space doses.

Yeah good thing we’re done snow we’ll done May take first available.  startling numbers emerged government-funded study also found infections peaked early March 2020, first national lockdown, “fell sharply” subsequent stay-at-home order, suggesting adherence rules.

How many people talking here? many infected early March? way early tell. guess Biden's measures positive effect (like requiring masks public transit), they're modest account size decline we're seeing now. serious conversation public health officials totally wrecked credibility next decade? We've gone ""two weeks flatten curve"" ""until cases die down"" ""wait vaccine"" ""wait everyone gets vaccine"" ""zero covid endless restrictions"". constant goalpost moving contradicting statements never-ending fearmongering made incredibly skeptical everything say.

Now sure. They're best; however, comes point realize straight lied things. encouraged endless restrictions told anyone much questioned lockdowns straight murderers. kind hard trust someone basically looked eyes told 23-year-old life livelihood matter even quarter much older adult COPD dementia.

I really think public health officials shot foot next time there's actual emergency. say covid real, dangerous, vast majority people fine. God forbid there's Ebola-like pandemic sweeps nation. Public health officials need trust trust long gone. No, desperation. UK vaccinated people, people per capita nation EU population larger million. UK EU, would second largest population.

It's clear EU's vaccination program failed relative success US, UK Israeli programs.  said covid soon. terrible judgment, low-balled close herd immunity estimate herd immunity would require around 80-90% population COVID-19 immunity, either prior infection vaccination. That's experts encouraging public get [COVID-19 good guessing whether things right wrong.

Stop it. understand, movement Australian states. (Please correct I'm wrong this).

Only outbreak one state states decide allowing travellers hot zones simply way going national lockdown United States.

Australia USA similar federation system federal government little powers comes public health. fells responsibility states. happens Australia state governments unilaterally decide serious go pedal metal lockdowns seriously. states decide lockdowns imposed state borders opened closed. national/federal government actually intended nothing.

After state governments decided serious, federal government choice go along support effort unlimited money printing schemes like JobSeeker JobKeeper.

So federation system like USA hindrance states serious. However, not, borders completely shut

And what? Tell what's inherently wrong that. ""it's economy"", another completely shut border country called Vietnam among even positive GDP growth 2020. level week, snows last 24 hours cause Stuff like horrific largely unreported mainstream.

What’s weekly cost pandemic US government, US economy?
Unemployment payments alone going multi billion range, never mind stimulus checks, housing relief, etc. 

The cost economy massively more, lost tax revenue.

So yes, remotely plausible price investment speeds reopening weeks, much less months quarters, pays itself.

Plus, use infrastructure things afterwards, it’s like goes away. Given promising mRNA vaccines are, highly doubt production capacity wasted.

I’m talking paying one company add new production line. I’m talking spending $10-100 billion, more, build entire new factory complexes, whatever needed.

Trumpism taught us anything, expect truth government officials. still break like sometimes. think get better things, personal standards move forward, never satisfied hate 🤷 Glad better, no, lazy (I know feeling well.) getting better passed holidays vaccine getting people. single politician election gets credit that. lot stereotypes various American states absolutely crushed right now.

Certain states reputation filled dumb, science-denying rednecks great job vaccinating people getting hospitalisations down. Certain states boast wealth tremendous social technological progress absolutely horrendous job every measure. 🚀🚀🚀 entire social life done screen. That's fine life would want. know someone convinced Covid-19 spreads primarily touching surfaces masks dangerous. believes people catch restaurants bars touch masks remove eat drink, catch mask off.

Same guy said wife caught even though always wears mask goes out. Yet constantly posting maskless selfies facebook friends. IIRC, Moderna vaccine 95% effective, basically even maskless talking infected person close quarters hour, you’d 5% chance getting infected long enough spread it. 5% still gamble you’re risking spreading deadly disease, want drive risk even wearing mask distancing.

But yes, practical purposes basically chance catching Covid you’re even moderately careful, even catch won’t get dangerously ill. Turmeric Cause SC Gov moron. changes now: much less likely experience severe covid, even symptomatic case covid infected. PROBABLY less likely infected altogether, PROBABLY less likely spread covid infected.

Obviously since many us fully vaccinated have, continue mask socially distance (just like said), wait rest us catch =D.

They've reason taking it.

1) Generally anti-science bozos

2) They're young feel they're risk

3) make job easier/different, they'll follow precautions regardless whether take vaccine not, 2 weeks 2nd injection whatever timeline matter.

Give people damn carrot they'll take vaccine, offer change yeah would people take it. Ha! It’s florida.  government stated today still ""some restrictions"" summer....

At point, definitely feel dead alive. want work elderly 

I'm going stop right there. 96% accurate false negatives means 4% positive cases missed, less 1/20. I'm talking hospitalizations, cases. would hope there's still lots cases people hospital, policies would based upon latter, former.

But knows Don’t say never nothing 800 years colonization! We're literally third wave right now.

SO maybe kind patients article refers to...IDK, English confusing language You’re spot on, good friend become hard core anti-vaccine spouting bullshit COVID vaccines non stop. asked her, response post X number people supposedly dying vaccines, number valid reason receive vaccine consider hundreds thousands people died COVID went “deaths overblown” rant. Thank God. almost want subscribe New York Times again. work school therapist Massachusetts person since September.  

I think 3 districts fully remote whole time. major urban cities lots multigenerational housing many gig/essential worker jobs much greater risk. also highest % positives state.

Most teachers least teaching highest needs students person, hybrid typical students well.  Shows you’re bigger idiot uneducated comment. posted another thread recently, West Virginia actually pretty good track record vaccination! Along Mississippi (!) they've never religious exemption option public school students standard childhood vaccines, vaccination rates actually always pretty great. I'm surprised they've done good job covid vaccine. Nice fear mongering. First time careers people begging input. don’t want 15 minutes end yet seems like multiple times aren’t working high risk environment unable build immunity normally, clearly following guidelines required us contain covid. start detaining people don’t wear masks etc - keep community see community infections reinfections drop significantly. Someone keeps getting reinfected likely spreading most. Try looking state's vaccination plan/site. Google ""How get Covid vaccine ____"". actually works. Needles bother all. I've plenty injections blood draws years. even study money once, took blood every 15 minutes. said, passed one time getting shot. clue why, did. happens. big deal. party power, get honest information president, kept saying need national mask mandate need testing capacity use defense production act build ventilators please please please pass fucking covid relief packages people...those crickets speak of? Good news finally wouldn’t politicised nearly much. 

I think non-trump republican admin also would politicized masks. Let's real, 95% mask politicization due trump. AZ say anything developing booster shot? course latter. looked up:

Very well die day government shuts everything one ever dies again. Nearly American cable news bad, regardless political slant. something agree on. That's fantastic siblings least. daughter us dogs, lol. Right, Ashish Jha always sane. 99% public health experts gone deep end. According Worldmeter, hit peak terms confirm daily cases January 8th 308K yesterday 145K. likely sub 100K couple weeks earliest. I’d rather hear damn truth government officials “health experts” opinion think can’t handle. Yes, whether vaccines actually valuable beyond wear mask important. part determining whether incentive getting vaccine even wear mask times.

You still get vaccine masks work, perfect. still get vaccine looking simply mask vs mask simplistic really making point, actually talking seriously issue. mask mask. mask there. friends vaccinated hanging house, that's mask. get vaccine safer. going shop, mask situation. vaccine progress towards rules.

I'd like elaborate million drawbacks wearing mask watch movie shop store. Please show mountain scientific evidence poses meaningful danger you. I've wearing one since started that, maybe I'm longer functioning well enough know hinting here.

Appealing people agreeing something like really something need do. We've people lot ridiculous stuff. lot people agree lot things they're wrong about. saying people going follow rules vaccinated, plenty people following rules since March 2020 really news. would say able anything long continue social distance follow rules.  weird thing people remember telling us remains lethal, that's actually bad virus survival long run. makes perfect sense, ""best practice"" zone virus make host sick, spread around, kill many hosts/too easily. That's made virus bad, mostly killed older people, everyone else, seem like much first. anything many cases. think sick, get wrong person infected, know they're sick, takes weeks kill them. 

But think going keep working way populations slaying ALSO remember hearing particular coronavirus mutate quickly well, is... well goes everything experts saying quickly developed vaccines would great job putting stop this. far, appears case.

Are supposed ignore evidence virus starting die out? Israel? U.K. U.S. peak around June 8th dropping ever since? Far fewer nursing home deaths last week so?

You've slowly, finally, changed words using (now ""health policies"") agree whole point tell *I'm* getting something! Well done USA!

As Brit vaccination procurement delivery probably single competent thing government managed pandemic. Flu went social distancing, people got flu vaccines. told dangerous going going around time. got one year. actually offered almost never happened life. guarantee people got vaccinated flu recent year factored number deaths cases dipping. Supposedly, vaccines COVID proving effective flu vaccine. Oh :( hope Euros 2021 cancelled I'll go mad, country qualified made us forget bad things moment, really depressing cancel single people without families. families bunker families, single people living single life suddenly find way less social options outside internet. year long time. face value, upshot article is:

""People buying sheds work working home hard really miss office life.""

And hidden subtle message:

""Come guys, office life great. miss it? Look ways bad people working home.""

One quote article:

""And occupational psychologists agree. Dr Chiara Amati says healthy degree separation home work. explains people, even hated commute, miss hours spent traffic train, psychologists call ""boundary activity"" puts space work leisure time.""

Like really? many us really miss spening 2.5 hours day commuting stuck traffic rammed busy commuter train? really exception can't wait suffocate amidst angry pushing shoving commuters?

It's much that, sure, many people prob miss office life. Maybe even miss commute. rather always kind ""Wasn't office life great"" themed articles I'm seeing. can't recall ever reading article working home helped someone. it, case, improved health. absolutely not, even tiny ounce, miss 2.5 hours day commuting rarely time weekday evenings anything. recall reading article mainstream media asking question, ""Could look ways make permanent arrangement prefer it?"" always, ""Mental health sfuffering. Domestic abuse up. economy can't cope. one likes working home. Come guys, commuting fun. People say otherwise looked admonished.""

Yet everyone work speak wants stay working home least flexibility. main stream media idea: Radio Silence. look AO. It’s probably gonna happen. fear big thing US? East-Europe people furious lockdown likely last 6 months want get back normal life Glad ok! dad severe, cold like symptoms along bad fatigue.. mom double pneumonia it.. stable enough sent home lots meds oxygen got long road ahead brazil variant vs south africa variant. one best ? Thanks, looked that. 

You know what's really interesting that? second dose. reported symptoms went placebo arm vaccine arm.

I'm sure means behaviors two groups striking. see masks required many public places point anyone wants shot go get one immediately, free cheap, nearby. think we'll point late April so. Vaccine begin FLOOD country around time July. giving additional eight weeks point freely available everyone times, I'd say June-ish going see looootta people throwing masks. dunno niece cool school starting around 10, 11. Think depends kid. iPads certainly don’t help. don’t know people got manipulated, lack better terms, thinking 60% effective wasn’t good enough. aiming started. That’s better current flu vaccines. blessed Moderna Pfizer vaccines top fact tweak let alone 95% rate. long people kept hospitals deaths decline goal reached. never supposed 0% cases day. Well hit nursing homes hardest first wave that's majority deaths occur. better treatments Europe unique concerns surrounding variants. Health officials scientists concerned variants, somewhat alleviated far vaccines still effective enough them. that's good news, right? vaccines still work well (as in: preventing severe illness) SA strain. Warm chicken microwave! They’re already trials.  ""Best reasonable effort"", right? 150M doses best.

Before someone explodes: pointing AZ good predictions, rather optimistic sales. means one careful numbers now. Osterholm tv yesterday saying we're going see explosion soon like we've never seen before. believe he's wrong, hell knows anymore. 

He also saying bizarre things U.K. numbers right google search away proven false. felt like Twilight Zone. It’s ensure aren’t blood vessel Wow really. pharmacy ? point Sars-COV-1 incorrect. thing is, better recent memories experiences SARS learned lesson it, antibodies.   stupid cancel  Thank volunteering time many cannot due health reasons. deserve shot. thank adding growing number people vaccinated.  tests people done check whether infected (whether PCR, rapid, whatever) general able differentiate variants. discovery full checking variants uses samples, fully genomic sequencing them. takes considerably time manual labor compared ""the tests"".

There exceptions. example, there's variety PCR testing looks 3 specific genes, one genes happened dropped British variant, could use specific PCR test see sample 2 3 genes tested for. PCR tests look another set genes, universally true. 

Usually, variant discovered new location full analysis either random sample samples take PCR/rapid/etc, somes cases interest (people connection SA recently visited, example). Interesting huh? almost like immune systems need exposure things low amounts (like outdoors) build immunity. Certainly seems way. data coming Israel incredibly encouraging, theyre dealing bunch mutated variants. absolute figures. words, I'm talking risk individual healthcare system. main argument need restrictions. Protecting vulnerable important, too, largely managed prevent that. 

A reasonalbe plan Finland situation pretty good would first vaccinate, say 75-year-olds 70-years-old etc. that's UK does. 

Germany (or alt least Berlin) done many things right, too. Giving vaccine first people 60 reasonablae, particularly capacity intensive care risk. 

Anyways, understand they're ""wrong"". something know idiots? pandemic go 2023 least. Anything else misinformation extremely developed country-centric. US president closer absolute monarch leader ""Free"" World. Murphy's Law. oldest baby almost 10 years ago. thanks clarification. honestly think lot people worried mRNA new tech happy get Johnson &amp; Johnson/Astra-Zeneca/Novavax ones. Meet new boss, old boss, terms creepyness that's sure. mean you’re able get vaccine although you’re probably fine there’s harm extra protection getting  new variant specifically sought sequenced US couple weeks ago iirc Yeah people acting like idea handle virus strains... meanwhile we’ve able handle nearly every flu strain except 2017 extremely effectively. thing lot people (hopefully) soon realise thinking back 2020 say  
""what bad year"" everyone tough time. lot people fail see exactly made bad. virus ? really. 


You find virus thing nature stay even 10 years now, one reading may experiece death close one due COVID-19 now. that's something stay us, like lot people experience pain loved one diagnosed cancer. thing really made 2020 suck virus, illnesses, health way. constant fear lockdowns. constant feeling danger propell danger. spread governments, media became effective enough became spread you, people. started blaming, started criticising doubting, someone might made aware recent ""turn events"" made governments introduce new restrictions, new laws, make new people criminals. 


So conclusion I'm trying say, 2020 shit year. new virus emerge. 2020 shit year governments media abused lockdowns, infected pretty much whole globe fear turned people other. believed them. stick 1.5 million shots per day, goal 2 doses, doubles time full/2-dose coverage. assume rate changing, every dose going towards second dose, 9 months. can’t believe stuck around long.  look deaths April versus positive cases compared fall spike see insane amount under-counting positives. bing cache:  Education, income geography. 

People immigrants developing countries rarely anti-vaxxers first-hand experience dangers infectious diseases people first-world countries collectively forgotten pre-Covid.

The reality that, e.g. undocumented people might avoid getting vaccinated afraid ""revealing"" authorities another issue. Except people get vaccinated chances evolutionary pressure allow vaccine resistant strains spread.   
Ideally vaccinate everyone possible.   
It urgent get world vaccinated soon possible order minimise chance vaccine resistant strains. president sets tone sets spending pandemic people reddit convinced olympics cancelled? Based what?  There's 5 months till Olympics States asked vaccine administration funding September. would allowed vaccine rollout occur faster easier could set infrastructure, trained people give vaccine, well refrigerator units storage. That's 100% Trump's White House blocking funding. close area SA variant Covid19 discovered mass testing occurring. wonder variant discovered. likely mechanism discovery. every test specific? tests able differentiate 'original' Covid19, variants previously unknown variants? Middle East? UAE’s per capita vaccinations 3X US, Bahrain slightly better US.  According Cuomo governors, state administered percentages they’re holding second dose, advised federal government. I'm sorry, sharing expert's opinion it, definitely not. feel like there's many points pandemic I've optimistic destroyed. I’ve better since stopped going it. Errmm... matters number people drives covid. example, deaths Ebola doesn’t mean “safer” driving. It’s far fewer people infected Ebola. great news amount people see line waiting vaccines good news well. take year get done. California fast strain that’s already become dominant. 

We don’t really know anything true transmission rates strains. 

There absolutely evidence UK strain take California strain that’s already there. 

That’s problem. Could it? Yes. Claiming without evidence means you’re taking post extreme position possible evidence. ICE  Link lazy U.S.? Ah hypocrisy. UK absolutely nothing nobody says anything cause everyone knows don’t give shit. know EU cares, that’s say something. good old UK approach world. Fuck em ass add nice words it. end it’s Trumpism better marketing. mention OSTER-FRICKIN-HOLM people saying confident normal summer insanely obscure podcast. theorize they’re goaded spouting pessimistic stuff big TV shows / interviews clicks / viewers. people never finish it?

Living Quebec depressing hell. government announce non-essential businesses finally reopen next week local news’ comment sections full angry people saying closed two months “ semblance summer “. Man, i’m soon give seeing people realize virus life. Weed actuslly helped get lockdowns lot better alcohol would. I'm Canada though fully legal wonder people would comply lockdowns could couch locked day lol agree Russian government credibility issues, press difficulties independence institutions questionable?

100% agreed. goes every nation earth. negate fact mRNA technology superior. technology quite yet terms example storage requirements etc make alternatives better technology. Vector based vaccines massive downside immunity vector reduces efficacy, mRNA downside. 

Incidentally CureVac vaccine expected Q3, also mRNA based, stable +5 C 3 months stable 24hrs room temperature. Nah, it’s numeral Ask Manaus deadly is. daughter go time time since lockdown.

I feel ya.

We find something makes us happy. Like song walk going feed foxes park, going see animals. Really ever little thing lifts spirits, seems manageable. Like pick get day life. Yep late. need fight. both. Fauci admitted lied masks order prevent mask run would leave frontline workers PPE. also admitted lied herd immunity threshold order convince Americans get vaccinated. Stop deifying him. Luckily countries already closed borders UK.  reminder current rate vaccination took 12 days administer 5 doses per 100 people US. nothing changes US well 20 doses per 100 administered end February. Meanwhile Canada getting 180K vaccines week Welp, Fauci saying reinfections happen kind upsetting, pretty much means wont natural immunity... I’m kinda middle. I’m willing take precautions family limits. I’ll stay another month till Winter want I’m gonna shelter place another full year remain unemployed them. plenty alternatives curfews lockdowns.

Yeah, wearing masks social distancing, since USA failed miserably that, lockdowns required. didn’t way, people “freedom” expense others is. Flight ban? 

The people who've banned entering since October tourists. Indian government's ""repatriation"" mission, Vande Bharat, essentially acted monopolistic flight service AirIndia--they've sending Indians across world, taking back, letting please overseas. 

From I've heard seen friends India, people stopped caring COVID-19 social distancing second Centre lifted restrictions state governments began re-opening bars social venues. going thing Canada. Pfizer Moderna pulling back orders focus countries actually invested vaccine development process. Honestly, I'm suprised expect ""owe"" us. skin game get last priority. turns can't deliver many doses thought people back line get cut out. sad unfortunate reality gonna do. comment linking sputniknews.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* No, would unethical. basically monitor check routinely. That's takes long (months COVID, years past diseases) phase 3 trials complete - need give people time see get infected not. 

Basically, part study, would give shot without saying whether real vaccine tell go normal life continue follow health guidelines. would call ask come regular basis see healthwise. 

Maybe type person sits home day never goes out, might get sick. maybe next person trial bus driver can't stay home, maybe Amazon delivery person. highly likely long enough timeline lots people exposed conditions virus present. People give AstraZeneca pass reason

Nobody ""giving pass"". Oxford produced developed high efficacious vaccine designed priced global solution. Rather constantly bashing AZ, celebrate fact vaccine effective vaccine distributed most. good news. Variant p.1 p.2 quickly becoming dominant strain wild. cities South Africa Brazil going another wave covid deaths, mind cities thought achieved herd immunity (over 75% infected) AZ already working combine Sputnik 5 (basically teo different Ad virus approach) Sure, honest china top 3 would think of, maybe far bed.   Yes literally is? Vaccinated means you’ve gotten vaccination, doesn’t mean you’ve necessarily gotten two. Also, numbers people ending hospital one vaccination extremely low it’ll mean get rid restrictions already. Great post. dad spent final weeks nursing home. nothing joyful air, ever. pay hell lot $17 bucks hour spend working years one them. Living civilized society “privilege” too. Can’t behave, lock jail mental institution. Go live boat ocean don’t want part civilized society ultimate freedom. 

With asymptomatics rapid spread, restricting confirmed infections asinine close effective enough. Leadership matters What's wild needed roll plan. Like people changing they're wearing masks. finally professionals charge distributing stuff. Directed Michael Bay think broader point things like Tuskegee Syphilis Study AIDS crisis groups people potentially legitimate reasons trust authorities matters public health. OTOH, much we've actually seen regarding vaccine skepticism conspiratorial nonsense. Johnson Johnson version seems promising, actually. Necessary? Maybe. bad move hindsight? Probably.

Should learn realize distancing business shutdowns probably practice needs end? Yeah.

Y'all pro Lockdown people playing fire point. never compliance right risk crazy guy screams moon lot people. people going dumb ""reopen"" rally, they'll quietly ignore ""rules"". teaches community college, guess there’s argument there. either case, based way money allocated, pandemic, doesn’t think he’ll back person year anyways, Regions seasons win that's known vaccine nationalism I'm it. protect citizens times dire need. also count people got COVID already part herd immunity, could double current official number comment linking nypost.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  upvote dont either. remember last January-feb exactly. Tests unreasonably expensive, companies taking advantage situation charging criminal prices need travel. cheapest get one 150 euro.

They sometimes also impossible get due practical problems. countries demand test made last 72 hours time arrive. labs charging flight ticket take 24 48 hours give negative PCR result. also limited booking slots sometimes simply possible test fast required

Then go online, guy photoshop tricks test hours later less price pay tesr, except goes literal criminal gang instead lab acting like bandit squeezing cash. bottom line virus spreads easily annoying common colds know hate. way forward either infection vaccination. Eventually everyone done one and/or other. hospitalizations plummet, crisis over. want vaccine free take chances. Could possibly happening guys?! 👍 Exactly. Pretty much vaccine efficacy regards impact pandemic. vaccines may stop people getting sniffles less, general efficacy same. Thank God! almost thought bad news. don’t think it’s bid deal like said I’m pay. don’t think would really help burnout though. see people getting burnt wether they’re making 50k 150k. end day poop, death, else, awful patients fun work with

Hospitals spend ancillary staff make working conditions better 30-50 (or even) sort covid protection?

When could start seeing trend cases hospitalization? haven’t gotten info. live Central Valley counties aren’t good this. Unironically short virus buy vaccine program proxy.

Just buy travel/hotel/restaurant/amusement/theater stocks. return next year almost entirely correlated performance immunity program next half year so.

Just avoid ones like AMC possibly AAL caught volatility WSB raids Probably still think Russian 5G track thoughts straight back Putin.  Ah, yes, ""the West"", renowned worldwide lack lying one shot protects well death severe disease. Roll out. Yes. text call friends family, it’s person. 
As noted pandemic, psychologically can’t replace person interactions virtual interactions. It’s wired. social species. need human contact. already made clear risk tolerance people know firmly stand. cautious ones know I’ll they’re ready emerge rejoin life won’t slowing personal plans activities placate them. Oxford tech inferior mRNA tech far 

What nonsense. There's reason Oxford vaccine given people world. answer questions people engage honestly?

When disingenuous behavior admit putting words mouth attacking arguments make, I'll happy set straight. then. terrorists locked away GITMO? Opt now, like 14 days stop spread, many local businesses bankrupted live, kids/teens depression lockdowns, suicides drug use time high. 
Opt mask.. mandatory. get vaccine passport future order participate society. Hardly opt now, it? think first lockdown necessary hospitals could prepare could get steps ahead.

Also hospital capacity truly threatened, majority world second wave. I’m coming home working abroad last 2.5 years. supposed come home initially August, unsure unemployment decided stay February incase vaccine distribution handled properly. Yes, deadly would reinfection be? surviving give level protection? waving ""reinfection"" word without information irresponsible scaremongering . Moderna Biotech literally enough European population. add enough doses 380M people 440M citizens.  stopped 2016 election. 50x happier before. don’t even miss tbh. Plus much free time.... spend Reddit LOL. Arizona took identical path case death decline absolutely restrictions here. we’re talking we? 675,000 deaths confirmed Spanish Flu America. would think wouldn’t anywhere close that, right? nothing done, like said, would’ve surpassing number. Easily. would effective Flu people would follow recommendations. Instead say ""It flu"" go lives normal. Meanwhile percentage go sleep never wake up. URL typo it. Correct URL: articles Walmart’s incentives payouts. It’s easily searched Google News. Emirates really well vaccinations. Look last big UFC fight, quite lot fans handful Arab Sheiks. Sign whats come weather warms West too. Everybody human makes mistakes. need ""expert"" like say that. I've already said makes mistakes held accountable, obviously know read. AstraZeneca's vaccine Sputnik V use adenoviruses vaccines employ different strategies avoiding possibility vector neutralization body.

AstraZeneca uses adenovirus infects chimpanzees, humans immunity those.

Russians use two different human adenoviruses two doses, first one Ad26, proven suffer problem. Humans appear able neutralize it.  much 'west' wanting buy vaccine made Russia. need look context West thinking like that; Russia lies lies almost...everything. every reason distrust vaccine sketchy-ass results lack true testing. confronted this, usual 'West get us' routine. blame single person doubtful.

But also smartest scientists world. scientists easily world-class put minds it. TBH sketch went promoting vaccine, deep knew probably legit. 

Western countries buying EU-produced products, I'm glad countries able get hands Russian one. vaccines = good entire world. Russia able help poorer countries put dent pandemic, deserve commended that. correct I’m wrong but: didn’t implement guarantee vaccines promised EU wouldn’t unfairly sold states?

In case don’t see would affect Japan unless planing “stealing” EU supply reason we're behind everything else, literal pile hot excrement that's impeached. see company produces Gamalaya Institute's vaccine apply EUA FDA, see US wanting actually use it.

For curious: published interim analysis anyone wants read company announced want soon apply CMA EMA, although EMA announced anything yet.

Now I'm curious Chinese vaccines. Sinovac one Sinopharm's vaccines published Phase III reports yet although ministries approved apparently already interim reports, published. I'm sure timetable publication data finalization, I'm hoping sooner later.

Either way, process EUL/PQ though, committee estimated announce results Sinopharm Sinovac March earliest maybe waiting final data reports  40 years ago would died something else, flu, cold, whatever. can’t expect life expectancy increase matter what. 

There plenty alternatives curfews lockdowns.  lol Oh come on.. we’ve seen million articles people. What’s wrong dogs getting one million published? 

There’s plenty misery go around. still getting... know ""need"". anonymous call work. Give date. deduce there. oh god, really though. Astrazeneca blue came 60% decrease doses delivered EU. time still delivering full UK. production lines completely separate, could sort ok. AZ contract EU states UK production factories part production line EU itself. Plus, worry vaccines transferred EU factories UK before. all, al lot complicated legal stuff still figured yet. 60% reduction deliveries, mentioned blue weeks said deliveries supposed take place, normal manufacturing delay. obviously gave enormous pressure EU committee look this.

As reaction, EU ""lashed out"" AZ imposed export check. Check, block, stealing either. Meaning vaccine exports factories EU soil, first need approved happen. EU much better tool make sure vaccine companies using tax-subsidised factories make profit elsewhere. far blocked exports yet, even UK. response AZ found 9 mln doses Q1. I'd say all's good ends (sort of) good.

BioNtech/Pfizer production massively ramped moment EU. new plant opened already Germany, also causing delays delivery. Without fuss (or let say reasonable fuss), communication clear deliveries fairly cut involved (or least most) one country. announced 75 million increase projected production Q2. 

I really felt out-of-place comment needed passive aggressive semi-funny response. still do. welcome disagree course, dislike it. fact probably should, smug European side showing. vaccine took long approve? we're ""so far ahead"" dont test results even separate virus. 1918 Flu 675,000 deaths America. We’re 200,000 deaths breaking even. nothing done, would’ve easily surpassed number.  freedom travel already. restricted, outcry. fucking wife Canada. (had planned 2020) get common-law married, can't together. vaccine means can't go see her, fuck point? open back up, confirm poster said never health border control militarization authorities changing globally. Indian partner seems hitting targets  Yeah became really apparent. Vice extent.  different one way matters; despite claiming ""two seconds"" fasc ist nation (which false literally ZERO chance happening anyone thinks otherwise either wanted happen stupid read constitution) happen, dictator masquerading president, allow leader enact unlimited term limits poison opposition. America seen success story even shit went last month, rationale thinkers knew nothing actually going happen. consistently people freely speaking mind disagree government, fact 2020 thing do, without fear undue recourse. see undue recourse, people actually able make better life themselves: See fauci Cohen post rump, better today trump disparaged them.  hey right, first time 150 years united states ""contested election"" winner still won, 4 years another free open election russia licking boots dictator.

The difference Trump Russia would ruler Russia people, Putin America would failed achieve dictorship.

That said, believe Sptunik effective protecting covid, wonder real/precise data. come reddit vaccine experts shit anything that's mRNA. past week, number corona infections decreased 20 percent 28,628, according RIVM. Fewer people tested, percentage positive tests hardly decreased: 11.7 11.4 percent. RIVM states epidemic would heading right direction, fact new, contagious variants virus ""throw spanner models, institute estimates two thirds infections variant causing great pressure hospitals Great Britain Ireland. several weeks actually two epidemics Netherlands, different addition British, three variants virus found Netherlands: South African (now found 23 times Netherlands) two Brazilian (found new variants higher reproduction number; according latest calculations, British 'R' 1.28. means 100 people corona infect 128 lower reproduction number classic variant, RIVM comes combined 'R' variants 0.97 15 January; 1. reproduction number 1, number sick people number infections found decreased recent weeks, 164 infections per 100 inhabitants, Netherlands still ""serious phase"" epidemic, according new hospital admissions registered past week, 166 fewer previous seven days. covid patients nursing wards, 254 ended ICU, 10 more. Data that? Teachers, bus drivers, health care workers got massacred Covid-19, can't huge effect. stuns recorded cases grocery store front line workers getting is. likely case parallel evolution No, deaths per capita would close 1918 H1N1 pandemic.  Honestly, hope things get better helpful practices like that. hope America's go school/work sick culture goes away too. move form colony, far I'm concerned. miss them. particular, documentary reports, Chinese government’s weeks-long insistence clear evidence human-to-human transmission virus lost rest world valuable time.

“By time knew transmissible human-to-human, cat bag. shot had, lost it,” says man go Reddit narrative China   comes science, prefer actually read literature. know people like play ""doomist vs everything's fine, nothing see here"" game around here, enjoy science understanding science means reading lots boring expected stuff, exciting scary trying prove disprove notions finding article back preconceived notions favorite notions. Reading articles fine, science, that's supposed do. much this. We’ve largely left fend last year. That’s doubly true places like Florida, Arizona, Texas, etc. yes, ole Joe said nothing could change trajectory leadership legend.   whew... called comorbidities reason, people didn’t die them, they’d called something else. People think life ""staying safe"" small imaginations. currently hospitalized metric went Maryland 34 yesterday. instead seeing people hospitalized, 34 let out! great news. Yeah theres nothing like entire administration gets set executive's order. executive everything hand right? Ironically case numbers would probably higher testing would much higher first spring.  Yeah, low effort ""Russia bad"" comments damn stupid. country made many advancements medicine among things. Glad published Lancet article back it. need vaccines looks like another piece ammo add world's arsenal. logic: angela merkel hasn’t vaccinated Biontech vaccine yet, sign probably ruled legitimate treatment aswell?

Also: [he getting Celebrations order battle won, get ready roll sleeves variant booster shots- war still on. keep missing point full range. Start taking deep breaths, calm down. 

My entire point human makes mistakes, said over. issue people like cannot admit human makes mistakes. need start screaming others science community also made mistake, like asked that?

He wrong, wrong, like human, admit move on. true. telling wife can’t believe haven’t sick much life. 

We used to, say, go mall, touch everything, stop food court lunch. I’d eat burger fries hands eat without washing hands first. 

Now think door handles, random objects I’d pick inspect.. oh, sometimes paid cash. CASH. anything filthier? 😂 feel like read 66% vs 94%+ vaccine. vaccine. I’ll take chances. Done living way.  Variant merging? ? ?

 He's attempt stay power failed. America perfect place sure, comparing corruption higher places hilarious. designed make shit. want illegal immigrants scared get vaccine keep spreading virus. reason fda says no? vote support Trump credit Biden beyond silly. going hit number whether Biden President. everything political. Yes! go world pandemic world omelet! brilliant, Skeepidy! I’ll take mine feta cheese spinach. Oooo convergent evolution let virus spread unchecked even people severe complications going mutate going get worse strains. take opportunity crush good vaccine still work somehow new strains. Let go long may evolve strain kills young people. blame what's point even. Another interesting similarity sorts J&amp;J vaccine Sputnik V single dose efficacy, APPARENTLY [73 Sputnik V. Sputnik V may appear efficacious single dose regiment J&amp;J's, that's yet investigated. 

I think would make anyone desperate choose deploy J&amp;J's vaccine, honestly. pretty good. Better two doses AstraZenica's. People give AstraZeneca pass reason. Imagine another vaccine efficacy 62%. would much outrage. couldn’t have. shut borders way NZ AU people would screamed racist. Also US set differently government it’s hard federal government make states things. could done better people need stop acting like works countries going work here. different countries different laws. fact thing happens multiple locations, increases virus ability spread, actually good evidence evolution, it. Evolution random. far Right break brains many people??? Sure, seems fair. What’s tally right now? I’m make haircut appointment late February! Never quite figured cut hair yet That’s probably correct. US yet seen full effects vaccination, think it’s reasonable expect things continue improving.

The timing interesting, started vaccinations “holiday surge” gave US particular spike January, natural decrease cases holiday spike. Europe South Africa peaks holidays variants around time. So, vaccinations really coincided end peak cases dropping nicely. 

I’d expect improve, apart major barrier vaccination distribution. another approval (j j) horizon, doubt problem. Imagine thinking EU order next generation time instead 3 months everyone else again. LOL.

Germany ordering vaccines 2022 alone Hungary making deals. done relying EU. Meanwhile two dozen governments stand try think ways nothing pushing responsibility onto someone else. I’m sorry, forgot nobody makes mistakes. You’ve probably always right whole life right, made mistakes right? He’s even admitted making mistakes, holds accountable. There’s reason he’s served 6 presidents counting. Come Florida. one gives single shit outside. You’ll hard time keeping people six feet away too. 😂 person responsible death EU, lockdowns persisting 2022, hundreds thousands lives lost, end Europe world power. Trump called one states overturn democratic election zero signs fraud. literally happened last month.

But, guess since trying poison someone get killed everything fine. suspect approve one shot waiting two shot trial results. second shot looks good they'll change recommendations.  scientists say lol detected small sample requires study conclusions made

BTW, used masks quarantines back 1918 well. Posted couple days ago look forward day sub pictures people drinking corona day Canada less half size Germany, *horrendously* bad...  ages testing positive last week. May suggest hatred corporations actually bending worldview something keeps seeing reality. 

This way live, dude. mutation found 11 214,159 samples, mostly area. I'm soiling pants yet. goes narrative, that's why. Probably I’m white collar professional conference calls day people saying “who knows ever go back.”

I started new job pandemic new industry. starting make good business contacts happy hours, signed conferences. I’ve trying since thing, it’s disheartening one *wants* go back office happy hours long business lunches. husband like magnet it. pregnant, careful. went amusement park ride immediately used hands eat popcorn almost sure that's caught cold. Cue 8 months pregnant miserable bronchitis. could've murdered him. [Captain Tom Moore died absolutely understand. absolutely allowed sob sessions wild mood swings (and I’m you). get day day, even hour hour. 

Sending mom hug. ❤️ early approval (other countries actually sped process too) make sure vaccinations start early possible. size economy nothing go it. notion Russia bankrupt helps sleep night it.   Plague, Inc. Absolutely fantastic. late spring indeed place adult wants vaccine get one. got summer take little breather vaccines retooled fall booster we’ll need AZ authorized UK yet?

Hahahahahhaa yeah, like month ago surprised AZ US trials time sites

I all. vaccine manufacturers forced conduct trials US well US pleased treated differently. wanna waste time conductinf clinical trials, let them. care way pandemic clinical trial sense?

In many ways. terms clinical trials. tested several vaccines population. terms vaccine manufacfuring too. much proactive supporting vaccine candidates early orders much succesful vaccinating population return. possibly similar varient spread here. Unlikely anything herd immunity. Decrease mobility (down 13% -33%) increase mask use 11% 77% overall) likely explanation. sad news. Rip good Sir Man. crazy think sub year now. Since January 2020. wild ride guys! We'll ride end! Oh no. Okay, teaching college bit different. There's much reasonable argument teaching college. Go away see mention things. top bubble olympics good japan, cost running olympics none tourist revenue Yes agree. disgusting *still* hearing PPE shortages hospitals big winter wave happened.

Honestly people point Europeans Americans selfish reason failed hard can't go week without going restaurants. load horse shit.

If look world, regardless restrictions utilized, countries strong leadership countries best. even major lockdowns.

China, New Zealand, Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore immediate strong responses plan get back normal. people listened better.

The governments Europe USA fumbled around like idiots months months people growing tired meaningless restrictions nothing. Especially look Florida fully open worse places like California even dine outdoors much winter.

Thank God vaccines came through. People we're going live awful state limbo another year rightfully badly government fucked up. Great news countries like mine (Mexico) mental health!

Even EU considering buying vaccine excellent news going back normal! Great news start week! IMO part corporations setting expectations shed real estate. know several companies floating in-person office work vast majority employees 2022 interim they'll start figuring many employees work remotely indefinitely.

While impact parts daily lives, absolutely impact certain areas. Downtown business districts remade, example. Commuting different. list goes on. going ""new normal"" lot people. Well, BA’s PR stunt really turn fiasco now, regardless contributed illness not. RIP. don’t begrudge one bit, friend. cynicism critical mass right now, means given patriotic impulses late. feels like finally landed solid blow nose thing, god dammit, I’m gonna celebrate it. 

And clear, I’m throwing hands government; I’m celebrating people finally fight thing government helping them, hobbling them. It’s solid “fuck you” anti-science peddlers denialists small-gubmint profiteers tried selling us hydroxycloriquine whatever fucking snake oil Mike Lindell trying convince us of.

Miles go sleep yet, least longer take journey balls stapled piano. Nope. life adventures things enjoyed pre-covid priceless. money could make ever want give life permanently. completely ignores boosters, though.

It's highly likely USA start snatching another 200M+ vaccines whichever variant decide need protect against. point countries, leaders, flawed. really Trump Putin. requested recently actually white collar employees afford work home forever.

I mean... care say, though, they're policy-making government employees public health officials?

Restrictions lifted hospitalizations go vaccine rates go up. individual people decide respond restrictions lifted them... book first flight Ibiza continue staying inside houses. Hopefully affect much either way. Yep, someone UK quite accurate assessment. Unless big unexpected delay supply, course. Yeah there's county residency requirements Texas (people driving hours find appointment), that's either local requirement pharmacist inventing rule. Whole pandemic restrictions ending. Keep 10k. want life back things enjoyed freedom worth far 10k. take everything grain salt days. people info gets manipulated, russia known for. crazy times. sad news. Tom Moore, 100-year-old World War II veteran raised millions Britain's health care system coronavirus pandemic, died testing positive COVID-19. Username checks out. Japanese know blame. Australians Canadians rest world.

Bye, weird nationalist think you’re talking different things. dude saying there’s still small chance get infected you’re vaccinated. vaccines better especially developed nations bought rhe existing vaccines like AZ,J&amp;J,pfizer,moderna etc. thid could mean poorer countries able get vaccinated sooner. academics I'm sorry source saying ""the vaccines taken South Americans flying country get shot.""

I cannot believe thing. Oh forget remind incivility allowed lmao. Get outa here, even Reddit deleted comment cuz it’s worthless love talk threads variants people saying “oh no, it’s effective vaccines” meanwhile completely ignore severe disease numbers trials almost completely eliminates hospitalizations....you know...the whole reason shut down? sad. incredible man. happy delaying vital vaccines nothing. Weird take mean it’s like Russia isn’t technically effective. 

I don’t get hate. Russia isn’t Syria. got universities doctors huge R&amp;D budget this.

I’m actually happy since whole world make multiple types effective vaccines one nation issues bank others. going pull specific quotes data article there's much contradicts think. Please read actual article, headline. Manufacturing things complicated -- see ""How Made"" video YouTube think much engineering work goes robots. recently read Moderna's big bottleneck current highly sterile environment required fill bottles example. They're asking put doses vial trying get companies fill contract labor.

Second, vaccines expire. suspect news articles suggesting we'd big advance production never made much sense first place. Even production line operating 100% capacity store finished vials indefinitely.  great news considering large number economically weaker countries relying this. Kudos Russia. stayed rhetoric initial days, would lot trust vaccine today. I'll repeat - J &amp; J, 2/3 chance get all, ZERO hospitalizations/deaths double-blind study. That's comparable really bad cold. 

I'll take it. means I'll survive virus. started trial December. follow similar timeline Pfizer - idea not, lot control terms community spread, prevalence positives test control groups - would release results time late March April. Honest question, matter produce? Like going send J&amp;J allied countries overshoot supply? 

I guess I'd rather protect Moderna/Pfizer issues unexpectedly come Also Sputnik Russian companion believe I’m getting really bummed hearing phrases like “new normal” people talking never going back normal. 

The people saying aren’t Broadway stagehands. aren’t employees corporate lunch cafeterias. aren’t bartenders. white collar employees afford work home forever. everyone that, livelihood depends returning normal. 

Who *doesn’t* want return normal? Normal good. Normal worked. Ye ye, mRNA used treating cancer too, least there's research that. crush viral vector delivery tropism modulated. make infect certain cell populations. UK sequencing way countries course finding mutations. Close borders makes feel better would make sense sequencing find mutations. Yeah going help world, it'll certainly help country. Plus think U.K. going stop manufacturing vaccines vaccinate population, they're giving people first would expect country tax money goes towards funding production vaccines. see relevant comment. data released September.

EDIT: used word ""didn't"" ""doesn't""  think UK absolutely leading way pandemic.

Leading way pandemic clinical trial Phase III trial results published ago there's still talk approval based US literally conducting clinical trials vaccine speak. kind answer question - Dr Anthony Fauci said waiting clinical trials US finalize.

Then FDA applying rigorous standards applied vaccines, trialed US get approval. guess even face emergency use, standardization necessary. surprised AZ US trials time sites. vaccine manufacturers were. 
Has AZ authorized UK yet? BCer here. hear ya. Stay strong, friend. We're rounding bend. Like person Florida whistleblowed state fudging statistics house raided it? I’m convinced it’s already widespread possibly even originated UK sub day astounded many people shitting constantly going trip, little mention he'd done country. veteran raised millions, sure, let's ignore talk shit took one last trip. think smartest decision? No, think makes awful person.  mean vaccine work new variants. Best case scenario well 100 variants vaccine neutralize them. read spike protein good candidate spike changes much, loses ability enter cell. Reddit posts back 2020 mentioned you’re saying won’t reach level without precautions placed. I’m arguing yes be. Even lots people aren’t following, many people are, that’s we’re “not bad.”  you’d think seem right like tbh Good one peer reviewed published prestigious british journal. Ok champ.  Yeah, think vaccines like ""scaffolding"" virus ""weakened"". Template also good metaphor. know Fauci virus.  us surpassing noted cases vaccinations good sign.. need beat strains take hold well okay mean time speed virus mutate dangerous strain based 2 things - probability (rate) mutation number viral particles able mutate. Covid considered quite slow mutator, take million covid viruses million seasonal flu viruses, flu viruses able mutate overcome vaccines much quicker. BUT, compare trillion covid viruses versus million flu viruses, covid mutate become resistent vaccines much quicker. MAJOR problem facing right now, sooo many covid viral particles world total mutation rate uncomfortably fast (if many people covid world right seasonal flu, mutates quicker, could literarly become vaccine resistent day, would able vaccinate people new variants would emerge quickly...), actually covid could mutate fast new stronger variant lowers vaccine efficiency could emerge every month even quicker, drag vaccination program months years, vaccines could become useless would start scratch, important vaccinate quickly lower amount viral particles enough overall mutation rate enough produce vaccine resistant strains near future. It’s him. It’s virus. I’m sorry feel Dr. Fauci lied you. ever live again, must devastated no, completely right. I'd take these. fair AstraZeneca, 100% efficacy moderate severe symptoms, get vaccine really stop giving fuck week second dose 😂😂😂 

(Always stay safe, ofc) wont happy go without wearing goddamn mask. *UK Variant arrives US soil*

Media: “get ready cases explode again!”

Actual data: cases freefall almost every single state flattened curve Curfews like NL don’t care going.

Regardless, going home someone everyone consents risk also recklessly injuring others. love see it!!!! rough road, finally coming together! would [like this?], indicate editor/transcriber addition.

Though, suppose would depend styleguide. actually click link, know 91.6% effective result came ongoing Phase III testing.

How people keep confidently wrong? say whatever want without source others provide study, approve? *yawn* Go bully someone else administration announced Tuesday soon begin direct shipments of coronavirus vaccines to retail pharmacies February 11, expanding points access Americans receive shots.

Doesn't say many doses hope significantly increase daily doses. That's meant would depend styleguide they're using. Thank you

I'm researching, talking pain management doctor Man 19 years average life expectancy UK dies covid rather it. think 100 year old man health issues aside covid pretty good innings tbh. actually I’m tired home thing constantly think catching shit. I’m sorry say never “normal” it’s gonna us long haul like flu ... may weaken it’ll here.. Remind me! July 1, 2021 sent 10.5 million week. 1.5 million per day. point EU blocks exports UK don’t. reality large number vaccines exported EU factories every day. That's mRNA does, makes cells make copies spike proteins virus train immune system recognize component (which binds ACE2 gets cells way.) love totalitarian mass murdering Soviet, hate modern moderately corrupt Russia. absurd fully vaccinated person still mask, etc, sets bad precedent society - ""Us vs Them"" will. good way encourage nonsense like health passports form medical-class warfare even better way society treat unvaccinated people like trash sub-human.

I know stupid we'll stick end regardless immunity. things 100% effective  America 90% way back normal summer, nearly 100% back normal year’s end. absolutely clear:

THIS hero role model looks like. Planned operational July sorry mother went much pain. Pain, chronic pain physically painful, emotionally painful to. 

It's also hard loved ones,  I'm sure warrior mother. 

I keep prayers 🙏 Hopefully right. march 2020, worst case scenario seems right way thinking. Hope better, prepare worst. hopeful vaccines long run really hope I'm wrong. realize 1918 pandemic H1N1, right? think smaller problem COVID-19? Everyone vulnerable. :/

See comments. still lose ability function without dying. California 20% fewer CoVID19 deaths per capita despite density multigenerational household working it.

That’s massive. France impressive pandemic agree, move seems sensible costs little. Sounds like night ending bad hangover. No. they’d use mid sentence. figured one English words used regularly. Like words languages use. claiming expert.  mean, hate alarmist headlines anyone, fact loss smell smell/taste distortion really linger months people. still gotten back. 

The reassuring thing vast majority us unlucky, I'd lying said worry me. i'm looking lot qualities next mayor ""takes covid seriously enough focus in-person events"" low bar dude apparently can't clear. Another good one. money available, given seen happen case numbers past 3 weeks accelerating rate vaccinations, taking short position COVID investing stocks basically free money. make sure it’s diversified enough performance tied sectors whole, much individual companies. 1, 2018 — new CDC-supported study published Vaccine conducted multiple flu seasons shows getting flu shot lessened risk severe influenza (flu) among adults, including reducing risk hospitalization admission intensive care unit (ICU), also lessened severity illness. CDC recommends annual flu vaccine everyone 6 months older. Annual flu vaccination varies well works, best available way prevent flu potentially serious study conducted four flu seasons 2012 2015 found flu vaccination prevented severe vaccination among adults reduced risk admitted hospital flu placed general ward bed 37 percent.
Flu vaccination even effective preventing severe forms flu reduced risk admitted ICU flu 82 excellent news. Regarding 2nd doses, I'm getting feeling we'll hearing lot ""heterologous boosting"" viral vector vaccines.
The Russians already think take pick.. whether AZ, J&amp;J, Sputnik. Mixing way go. mean, [July sure. Pandemic end since it'll keep going rest world, I'm optimistic we'll done US point summer. univestiy said second governor opens us they'll vaccinate us hoping happens summer, would easier dealing back home UK talking combining Pfizer Moderna got lot blowback it. think must backed seems fallen news since around Christmas, lot people pretty upset it... R number common sense.

Exponential growth common sense.

Almost one grasps intuitively many people believe spell - whether R significantly 1.

When consider vaccines impact growth population, also viral load exponential reproduction vaccine inside individual, surprising people grasp effect disease frequency severity mutations combined. observations wrong.

You're someone probably enjoyed pandemic liked equalized everyone home. actual positivity, scared success going back ""normal"". well might recommendation, one things doubt ever see actually either mandated states fed, enforced. exactly could Russia deal supply referring point TV news hosts influencing governments all. do. bring Chris Cuomo recommending COVID restrictions brother recently. guess similar situation Scotland well, though think speed mass centres opening up. That's fair right - I'm espresso depresso, lol thing is, peer-reviewed source, Russian Lancet wrote research, also checked funded research:

**Funding**

Moscow City Health Department, Russian Direct Investment Fund, Sberbank, RUSAL. 

&amp;#x200B;

So Russian government investment fund would pay research would say vaccine sucks. actually right. Every pandemic starts small amount (known) cases. Vaccines least decently effective them, already tweaking formulas handle variants. Wait. subreddit shits Russia prevailing leftism. said multiple times Russian vax placebo. 

Shame! one shot really good news rapidly change course pandemic. Russia’s even trialing 1-dose “Sputnik Light” That's lot salt 200 New COVID relief plan: Vent hoods everyone! good news, right? Sometimes can’t tell sub Knowing word colloquially using language. 


You know word ""Da"" means yes Russian. say colloquial english every time speak now? reddit. people talking kids. blame world skepticism. Russian doping scandal, know Russian labs perfectly open corruption. illiberal dictator former superpower that's declining decades, Putin every reason world put vaccine first, even meant cutting corners safety efficacy.

After all, would care vaccine effective even dangerous? arrest kill Russian criticizes him. plenty gain terms prestige first, little lose vaccine ineffective, already got desired PR victory West. preacher? served country twice, let country's leadership. Please let death vain! Stay home. Protect NHS. Save lives. That's think weird people think conspiracy. Nobody, even people money, enjoys shit. Yeah, billionaire sounds nice restrictions can't do. I'm sure everyone eager get back normal am. EU exporting none. Private companies exporting them... It’s hard learn wear mask properly. takes 30-45 days average form habit adults. almost year pandemic, still wearing mask properly, don’t want learn unable learn. 

My niece 6 years old wears mask properly corrects adults wear it. also corrects adults wash hands them, still don’t ... happened list 5 times already NEW: federal government begin shipping coronavirus vaccines 6,500 retail pharmacies across country February 11, according Jeff Zients, White House COVID-19 response coordinator. use whole box True, ""vaccine resistant"" mean ""causes serious disease vaccinated unvaccinated equal proportion.""

A strain zero cross immunity, spreads worse severity, highly unlikely. March 2020 lot media experts developed sort orthodox (though new) idea handle pandemic, modeled combination China South Korea. lock hard crush curve. open slowly gradually. keep everything check contact tracing masks.

The problem actually work places, crush curve low enough, keep virus check matter summer over. 

*If* worked, DeSantis would look like goon. since didn't, strategy really much closer way experts advised people handle pandemic 2020: keep much normal life possible trying avoid uncontrolled outbreaks overwhelmed hospitals. produced worse results, better/more sustainable quality life.

Now, think one reason Florida's results OK already lot measures place protect elderly people respiratory diseases -- to, many elderly people do. course cities ""closed"" state whole. 

But think there's tendency praise politicians right policies even work. criticize things objectively useless (closing beaches) dangerous way (closing schools). [I predicting last night Oxford screwed giving group half doses somehow returned efficacy figure 90%? Well MHRA looked data came conclusion higher efficacy actually due longer interval doses. That's talk half doses disappeared. 

I understand biology behind results would consistent hypothesis. doses administered 12 weeks apart like UK achieve much higher figure 62%. what's great synergises UK's strategy focussing saving lives getting first doses many people's arms possible. please. True, trending show minimum max rate day currently achievable. Maybe sustainable, maybe not, that's still lot, especially early. think keep rising. I’m every time get plane well (even mandate). That’s odd. Used play old games Russians, word they’d say English victory they’d win.  town live in? That's true. I'm justifying decision considering EU looking late autumn milestone significant number vaccinations, maybe strategy push younger vaccinated economy prevented crumbling. Two years lock downs bankrupt many countries. NOOOOOOOOOO This.  could use Canada, eh. California shows true... want FDA approval, necessity. 

The company losa lol. US population. one gonna lose breath US requesting special treatment order able protect population. different clinical trials.

Yeah? know? mentioned seperately. agree UK going advice scientific community spacing 2 doses. agree US lot developing vaccines. I'm okay saying US lead fight. UK well too. 3000 dose? incompetent. 4? want pessimistic, odds vaccine resistant strain coming next year zero. reading wrong, that's confidence interval overall efficacy, efficacy two regimes. Check table 1 actual numbers: SD/SD 63.1% (confidence interval 51.8%, 71.7%) LD/SD 80.7% (62.1%, 90.2%). Cool... got good source Chris Cuomo setting NY COVID restrictions? I'm pretty sure announced reopening indoor dining relaxing restrictions. Gotta celebrate wins else you’ll go insane So? seriously believe previous study published Lancet 8th December used data day before? studies cut date 4th November yes new data. brexit brats voting you? legit best way use vaccine talk ones actually help. talk UK? made clear don’t give shit. would argument EU wasn’t suffering exact issues. do. Canada, Japan, SK boat EU. US UK left space others. that’s British way. talk action. Unless, course, fuck someone over. Indeed is. I'm Russia. news Sputnik-V naming Спутник-V Спутник-5. ""V"" ""virus"". well mutation really sauk mean... would PAY 10,000 end pandemic. successful mean ignore possible consequences successful. companies backed vaccine effective. could've one them. happens find efficacy like 30%? People got shot might think immune stop social distancing. Causing covid spread even more. 😂😂😂😂😂 everyday friend .. I’m stating facts based observations year long shitshow dealing with. agree.   No. 3? Sputnik then. way managed turn science religion something special. Would like add Sputnik dollar more? top priority obviously curb pandemic, I'll support whatever recommendation helps that. 

Despite this, wish share anecdotal mask-related pain: work outdoors 64th parallel (near arctic circle), terrible, terrible vision requires corrective glasses. wearing mask, glasses dew up, cold days freeze. remove gloves press fingers glasses melt ice, ice cold fingers. I'll put glasses back on, breathe out, process repeats. Though somewhat alleviated getting mask glasses, still happens every time look down.

It suuuuuucks. Jelly World doesn’t exist! Human beings mean? know yet much (if all) vaccinated people transmit virus, we're still early days rolling vaccinations, public setting likely surrounded 90% unvaccinated people.

""Wait people vaccinated"" big difference ""permanent social distancing masking"" weakened immune system eligible yet. 70 year old parents became eligible yesterday. still way go. would better anti-vaxxers case.  mean accomplishment, certainly help us pre-september, produce booster shots required new variants, actually domestic source sold lifetime black swan event. Never again. care actually airborne ebola next time. speak clinic (FQHC), town, county state (Montana): measly trickle vaccine emanating state. giving everything received feds. There's minimal lag zero stockpile. Everyone knew N95 best masks last year prevented public buying hospital workers needed it. access n95 masks sooner mandated early wouldn’t mess. reason can’t wear cloth masks hospitals, DON’T WORK. trust anything medical experts say know better told people wear shitty cloth masks. think general public access proper masks last year would lot less people getting sick going hospital. would think would encouraged N95 masks back March unsure virus spreads. would see hospital workers full PPE knew virus extremely contagious. here. Moved home expecting summer most, would move NYC after. Time future roommates freaking clue shit normal enough justify moving decent backup job prospects Though getting sick necessarily mean hospitalization either. One possible end results always become less severe endemic infection. generally tends evolutionary pressure direction killing host typically less effective survival strategy killing da won't. might make difference booster shots variants might need every year after. People jumping line already access hospital worker. know plenty people 65, non essential, already got shot. check surface traces virus whether also walls. that's probably do. understanding aerosol transmission relatively tricky trace aerosols stay air 3 hours. case person infected wearing mask elevator walls traces Covid strain probably safe assume aerosols. people wearing mask panel traces Covid it, walls, probably fomite transmission.  that’s true doubt they’d lie me. Would love know whether memories pandemic. Also, I'm sure they're saying survived Spanish flu *pandemic*, survived infected herself. Anyone else remember [the rush hacking Western vaccine data development phase? Gee, might something 🧐 FL surge right now, going right now, it’s whole article about.

We talk factors, like multigenerational households CA, density, brown people.

But end day, FL killed 20% Americans, Governor undermined every public health intervention every step way. Ah shit, unexpected sad see. world laughing videos coming Wuhan mid January. March 11 2020 declared pandemic. Fauci really like way look. doesn't. says COVID found Italy earlier first confirmed case.

That necessarily prove anything Italy Spain first hit outside Asia. Vaccine production linear scale though. Sure first month slow exponential growth Love Fauci absurd I'm sorry. use ONE actually fits worn every day 8 months lying floor car pile Frito residue rarely use ""companion"" meaning ""sputnik"". Oh, won’t dear. license, took driving test, insurance, wear seatbelt, follow speed limit. follow rules driving. everyone mask wearing social distancing, things would lot safer. Please go.

It does, results actually say better wait. everything Russia Sputnik?? I'm essential work middle bunch farming towns. well aware continued anger democratic conspiracy. reminds post awhile back people celebrating Biden ""smart enough get pandemic without catching it, unlike current president"" comments people saying like ""I like implication dead parent stupid essential worker caught it."" downvoted heavily course.  says rather large number online reports, I'm done google searches. How? pubs shut. America competent administration backing rollout. surprised soon eclipses UK's world class rollout. There's real reason get another vaccine already J&amp;J shot. Either vaccine short supply would selfish get second vaccine shot, everyone world wants vaccine one case would pointless get second shot. yes, worked Regan, Bush Sr, Clinton, Bush Jr, Obama Trump. one best experts US World.

I'm guessing position virus purposefully created infect us all. plan, think $600,000 (because $600,000 paid promised $7.4mil) made difference?

How tie covid fake pandemic created Bill Gates caused 5G? that's rfk saying. hire new experts? ones? overwhelmed. Italy bring Army go house house collect dead.  excuse first stupid politicians sucked Macron trying get French pharma firm (Sanofi) piece action vaccine utterly failed. we're low vaccination supply least Germany, we've got clusterfuck individual state level politicians charge medical policies they're they're thing.

Such shame. really hope things speed guys EU soon though!! crazy see nations seen many deaths also slow rollout vaccine. I've heard many great things superior healthcare Europe well, baffling doofus (former) President able put vaccination plan besting world. every package takes one additional day, next etc simply shifts vaccine arrival one day everything. 

But course ""affecting"" them. Similarly new approved sticker box arrives time also technically affects it. Agree fat shaming may helpful. hand-waiving away \~450k COVID deaths they're fat and/or old insane. 

But still recognize high rate obesity large contributor high COVID death rates population? fighting obesity requires amount personal responsibility? Right, idea revised US-Canada approach would allow us get ones ordered bought Pfizer plants US rather sources EU currently midst production delays export control debacle. (speaking Canadian, clarify) objection US prioritizing citizens way been, vaccine landscape US changed sufficiently could start exporting doses would hope countries would willing consider this. I'm actual virologist anything, read papers listen virologists say Internet discount crap anything said reddit.

I may actually strong arguing SARS-CoV-2 probably produce sterilizing immunity, point matter nobody terribly cares that. good reason think may though. vaccines certainly produce true sterilizing immunity since get shot arm winds lymph nodes armpits never gets close exposed mucosal surfaces. Nobody really cares distinction though. vaccine makes never notice infection never develop symptoms that's great. got natural booster shot.  Design = trivial 
Scale manufacture = trivial Nobody said that. said gone tests trials normally required vaccine put market. recently happened...

Moderna made vaccine 2 days sometime last January, there's reason saw first post-trial shot administered December 2020. Around 100k more. Model pessimistic. single shot effective preventing deaths others looked low-risk groups like &lt;40, etc. Yeah know trust Russian made vaccine surprised see approved less suseptable populations. almost 70% effective, one trials hospitalized died. vaccinated, less spread be. getting less vaccine ordered. heck AZ gonna get approved US? guess expanding amount pharmacies access. work pharmacy supposed get shipment last month never state government kinda botched rollout distribution  We're averaging 400k day (2.82m week). rate we'll done late May/early June. also Moderna orders arriving next month sounds like plot movie joke Funny real president do... say I'm skeptical plans fail they're implemented properly. really know many countries East Asia low cases, many countries well many different policies seems likely there's regional factor, second waves hit European countries time.

Many places waited long time open, trying see lockdown could get cases low experts wanted them. opened up, many cases, social distancing broken (as saw protests U.S.) places opened late, like California, better states opened early, often worse.

Contact tracing works case levels low; everyone abandon soon rise high. summer, countries *thought* contact tracing masks keeping things check, realize weather, really prepare inevitable second wave.

So think lot damage done idea known way control virus. places tried hard could control, often harder countries controlled it.  not.

Please try find anywhere said thing. fact, I've said opposite. 

Are confusing someone else? Remember, first reply someone me. jumped wrong per capita point. first wave yes, think could argue exercise rational thinking basic compassion, correct?

They overwhelmed. Italy bring Army go house house collect least UK blazing forward vaccine rollout, I'm sure rest Europe lagging far behind.

Some stupid politicians sucked Macron trying get French pharma firm (Sanofi) piece action vaccine utterly failed. we're low vaccination supply least Germany, we've got clusterfuck individual state level politicians charge medical policies they're they're thing. this? don’t remember roads traffic closed. essential workers essential businesses. remain open. 

DeBlasio closed roads easier pedestrian access restaurants. adopted strategy immunizing everyone first, goal giving second doses 12 weeks later Pfizer AstraZeneca vaccines. guy loves talking sides mask maybe March tracking using /r/China_Flu big subreddit. think average person may vaguely familiar us internet weirdos obsessively watching leaked videos hospitals starting like Dec/Jan. Oxford literally released data today, though. like vaccine development news itself, stories doom gloom reality outperforming expectations. live California lock downs far state experienced. Outdoor dining shut two months 97% population that’s top restrictions since March. Barber shops salons experienced multiple shut downs. Retailers 20% person capacity. 

No state experienced measures parameters changed multiple times. Actually sad story Russian science suppressed Russian government, imo. mean, scientists something, TESTING it, politicians needed make cheap statements. - Putin said Russia made vaccine although tested. Technically, lot countries created vaccines, test too. 


Putin needed make statement reasons - he's exactly popular right Russia. Especially Corona. 


I mean, surprised somebody call Putin liar. reputation. already called UK variant super covid would ultra covid Google Translate says both. fingers crossed this. Haven’t seen family year don’t want travel without vaccine. Pharmacy vons grocery store. live California rules may different state state. I'm actually completely sure means affects transmission? paper show rates asymptomatic infections unchanged vaccine? October? Wuhan went lockdown January 23rd 2020. Even point one idea scale thing. wondering would hang people can’t take vaccine, you’re vaccinated? authorities insisted mid-summer last year

And even reluctantly accepted it. fall certain leader got sick SARS-CoV-2 CDC finally officially recognized Covid spreads aerosols (because said leader reverse it) truly something forgotten.

💯 suggesting contagious versions covid somehow less deadly? saying vaccines make newer contagious versions less deadly? live United States Indiana. opening vaccinations age group 65-69 family friend got scheduled October another March. said lists filled that’s earliest could based called in. 6 year old somehow caught cold, taken anywhere long time, except 1 trip grocery store could see civilization still existed. That's took... private partnerships Walmart, CVS, entities needed.

I really hope happens quickly. even care vaccine. There’s evidence suggest jumping conclusions. one knows got infected. 

please point conclusion jumped to. said nothing got infected. travelling companion Earth? So, like satellite? 😉 would things exponentially infectious leading hospital collapse followed collapse funeral industry. 

This isn’t comparable potentially fatal things. area require proof residence and/or proof employment need appointment i.e. can't walk in, could different places. basically left state county decide. 46 young terms covid risks. people say people 20s, still without risks. *actual* significantly lower risk. perspective.... vaccinated 8000 people yesterday.
Like total. entire country. Athletes need play stay home. changed title clarify story. original implied nearby manger stepped direct traffic.

*A Chick-fil-A manager saved drive-thru COVID-19 vaccination clinic traffic backed up* majority adults vaccinated, people dying people want get vaccine. think realistic expect people wear masks, socially distance, limit capacities, skip concerts conventions, kill businesses tiny number people country choosing forego medical treatment.

I think bottom line. going see support public health measures drop quickly reach point there's less people dying Covid car wrecks day 99% refused vaccination downside, can't get vaccinated Sunday now.

/s body ready that's true, incredibly worrying. France one anti vaccination countries world, pushing people think vaccine dangerous.

From medical point view, would rather people wanted something know get soon worried even one these. west get enslave, brutalize bomb world, also feel moral superiority themselves. fucking amazing people thought biannual Olympic flu plenty epic second one wasn't, know condescending like that? even live France ? bet lol people type childish here. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Nearly half lives nursing homes meanwhile lock people little risk getting sick. I’m wondering large snowstorms across country past 4 days caused slowdown Mmmm, omelets around world! Yes sure did. Prime Minister can't wait tell everyone that.
But psssssst. Half world done COVID time start vaccinating general public. We've told September general population. yes, Trudeau forgot important detail.... WHEN. So, coma?

Nothing Joe, absolutely fucking nothing. always wonder endgame type coverage. virus always mutate, majority people vaccinated, give advantage mutations escape vaccine.

So idea here? shut everything virus eliminated everywhere entire world? that's logic. 

Most experts say proposing that, insane, they're currently proposing lot things considered insane 12 months ago. 

I feel like articles create hopelessness discourage people getting vaccine. We've already shut stop pandemic pandemic history world. do? say ""life must go back normal even virus might mutate?""

I hope people say enough vaccinated, fear point (conscious unconscious) create fear vaccination enough, social distancing needs permanent. wear glasses N95 actually lot comfortable fog vaccines / boosters aren’t effective need let people live.

That's I'm saying; something else, taking many precautions covid. wAsnT ReAL LoCkDoWn It’s predicted US economy recover fairly quickly compared EU  oblivious it, recognize lesser evil directly saving hundreds thousands lives via restrictions.

Oh thank you!! misread original
 comment thought pandemic.

I don’t see anything wrong governor coming city myself. 

It’s completely irrelevant pandemic sub anyway. giving vaccine people risk, AZ one.

Its pretty simple. Yeah struggle real.  measure efficacy via PCR instead symptoms

According published results Lancet, [efficacy calculated symptomatic Pfizer Moderna (J&amp;J used moderate severe cases efficacy primary efficacy analysis included symptomatic COVID-19 seronegative participants nucleic acid amplification test-positive swab 14 days second dose vaccine.

They ALSO tested efficacy asymptomatic COVID, way less efficacious 62% preventing asymptomatic COVID, really even statistically infections unreported symptoms detected 69 participants ([table Vaccine efficacy 24 LD/SD recipients 58·9% (95% CI 1·0 82·9), whereas 3·8% (−72·4 46·3) 45 participants receiving SD/SD ([table want J&amp;J terrified needles. big benefit would simply act delaying second dose could get people vaccinated first one. efficacy good better 3 month (or more) delay second dose could really get lot people protected quickly.

Here Utah number initial first doses declining 2 weeks. giving lot doses majority second doses. **If** could delay without downside, potential upside, would huge implications getting virus control. Reinfections happening way different immunity. instance, maybe reinfected immune system limits seriousness illness. 

The reason SARS-CoV2 deadly due complete lack built immunity. immunity population wide, changes. goal vaccines turn COVID normal cold/flu, eliminate entirely.   no. i'm saying are, now, studies show maskless setting like indoor dining, even distancing, virus spread around carried AC airflows.

one year shit feel kind sort clear indoor spaces many people risky bastard spreads around via droplets aerosol. restaurant sit take mask. that's it. wanna go say risky, go ahead, even care point.  course not. would rather shit, finding everyone lived life fullest without you, problems finding everyone else sitting inside anyway.

I’m saying he’ll happy, it’s small consolation.  idea point time curevac sanofi vaccines released delayed hence extra demand pfizer got novartis help make more

BTW Bayer got involved Curevac. first Satellite, Sputnik, traveling companion planet Earth. name comes from. 

But yes, meaning word considered archaic now. literally bad war criminal. exactly. time new strain different enough (from previous strains) vaccine longer effective, going get update. Now, multiple strains show time (like UK, South African, Brazillian, Ohio variants shown recently), there's reason combine one comprehensive update. start get big portion world vaccinated, fewer sick people mean fewer chances virus mutate, slow rate need get booster shots. really, truly, race time vaccinate people fast enough get ahead mutation rate reduce number future strains.

Yes, terrible jobs lost. overall ""worst economic downturn since great depression"", even worst last decade. say given aid ignorant. local Target. Never knew much cheaper get wasted home 2020!  think grand scale _that_ many people died covid. Relatively speaken ofcourse. Netherlands estimates say 8% people gotten it. Let’s say older vunerable people careful general population.. expect maybe 8% decline health related causes. probably also diminished fact recovered covid might die easily coming years. Eh, teachers California Chicago already announced return school even get vaccinated. promised months vaccine standard get back class.

And they're ethical teachers northern Virginia. actually given vaccine (before anybody else county, including old people) promise they'd return school vaccine. then, getting vaccine, NoVa teachers broke promise announced returning school all. 

If think I'm saying true, well, guess what, already happened. I'd like see 'will arrested' instead passive 'face arrest'. France worryingly anti-vax country.

source? Haha sub ""everything science"", trash media article saying hurricane hit country (metaphorically) nothing science, everyone said evidence based downvoted (prevents 100% hospitalizations).

Which actually important metric, cause, know this, long covid. Life normal vaccine prevent long covid. Nah I'll still pass Russian Chinese vaccine. Hope Canadian vaccine completed soon...

Strict stay home orders 40m across entire state, last get pretend lockdown never happened fails. Got it. Thanks want vaccine before? Trump symptom disease: everything insane hyperbole half truths that's drives attention clicks subscribers votes etc.

Look popular politicians world, they're like that, Biden. frankly popular rational candidates decided drop support him. honestly people refuse get available that's them. shouldnt shutting everything protect antivaxers could April/May phase 3/4. advice open schools elementary aged children children special needs. I'm referring specifically advice multi-disciplinary panel NY expanded elaborated CDC guidelines. also stipulates safety measures place school prepared follow. talking following advice open schools, already moot schools cannot follow safety guidelines certainly can't make HVAC improvements recommend.

The idea toll Covid less schools open, education small part picture. Essentially, they're acknowledging lose children covid, think losing domestic violence increases hunger. child care may also improve economy, reducing deaths due poverty.

I worry panel's calculous off. Current mortality rate K-12 students 7.5 per 100k confirmed cases. 5% Florida k-12 students confirmed covid infections, least double end year, we'll call conservative estimate 10% students get virus. 50 million students, expect 5 million infected 375 die. amount could offset benefits kids schools.

BUT, 50 million get covid? we're talking 3,750 die. lung pulmonary damage covid permanent life altering/shortening? okay generation kids die 40s 50s heart failure require oxygen survive, like polio kids generations back? teachers? mortality rates much higher children. many dead elementary school teachers many? may misread article, impression counting vial six doses necessary reach 2,000,000,000 doses 2021 goal. also necessary 200,000,000 doses May goal? That's choice EMA recommended using vaccine age groups *will* lead unvaccinated old people dying. 

They literally denying vaccine group needs nowhere near enough Pfizer vaccines go around meantime. 66% actually pretty good vaccine research, 90%+ effectiveness we’ve seen vaccines extremely good, 66% get job done vaccination rates high enough. 

The 66% doenst say lot much virus stays body, says much better preventing hospitalization groups people. science.

Sorry, I'm gonna keep laughing idiots reddit NYC population far denser rest state, don’t compare apples oranges. Masks don’t really slow spread virus much. Plus, improper use masks (what’s actually happening society) decrease efficacy masks lot. 

Let put way, say you’re wearing mask hypothetically, virus don’t know it. Let’s also say you’re outdoors. use surgical/cloth mask, breath go directly mask. way, lots virus particles collected face mask inside. take mask reason touch it/your face, hands become contaminated. handshake someone, transmitting virus particles hand him/her. he/she touches face, he/she virus enter somehow. hand, don’t wear mask, virus particles go air outdoors, lot diluted. touch face, virus particles don’t rest face. way, hands aren’t contaminated. Oh man, exhausting. 


Your literal post replying says, quote, ""only used historical movies"". 


It's not. name. 


And no, also incorrect Russians immediately associate V Victory. extremely uncommon context means little.

It's little bit ""lol hate rich people""  Bye Felicia. Move list, plenty people want it. He's horrendous “public health professional”. rhetoric extremely negative &amp; detrimental mental health population. public battling physical health crisis people like Osterholm seem determined ensure there’s mental health crisis fight right along it. It’s disgusting.  did. left unsaid give organism billions chances change, going change. collective narrative involved never many cases even months ago, low level consensus 'it happen'.

Well, are, likely happen hit crossover window infection vaccination. Cringe France strikes Good. Good. clearly Russians speak English know international two-finger sign victory.  hope recovers quickly without major complications. hope everyone actually.  Common sense, live people common sense? Honest question lay person:

The message vaccination masks distancing still required don’t know whether still infect others vaccinated. would assume still level replication happening sinuses upper respiratory pathways.

If true, square impetus pushing vaccinations suppressing replication (and ultimately mutations)? sound like contradictory statements. people still contagious vaccinated, getting vaccine stop replication ultimately mutations?

Experts: little help? Something isn’t computing me.... Never said otherwise, completely understand behavior. saying literal antivaxx logic anyone subscribing better antivaxxer. probably focusing non-western markets though, given ease manufacture transport.

It focus. Az seem set local production everywhere could, us included. 

Oxford University trails. Unfortunately, well ethical rather small, need rolled quickly problem. Normally would years get data places matter.

The Company one USA like said though, soon data.  storm blanketing northeast helping things Colorado covid infection counting protocol changed?

No conspiracy here, curious way count who's/was infected changed numbers going every day. countries problems new mutations, seems US better time. lock downs? Vaccination? people aware? tide going tsunami? millions people anxiously awaiting turn, try drag rest forward. course West sink low accept Russian medicine 

You see shit like Icarus lengths go doping athletes good reason concern.

But people would love considerable scientific prowess could considered consistently dependable.

But I'm also thrilled countires many drugs manufactured India. know someoen worked one large generic drug makers shut indian plants becuase kept fabricating results fucked production. 


It took years convince damage fraudulent drugs worse cost throwing bad batches. Yeah, per Atlantic, Brazil variant that's reinfection time. We're going end needing another round vaccinations almost back back think. first usual procedure would use tissue culture classical way studying bacteria viruses. Serial dilutions followed plating. used 100 years, may modern (and hopefully better) methods old fashioned mind unaware of. 

The 'infectious dose' has, knowledge, studied animal models. ethical dilemmas human subjects preclude human studies. course human experimentation done historically. classic horror story Nazis, similar medical atrocities happened USA China though connected present situation. dishonest example comes immediately mind [the incident poor people area Bhopal (as suffered enough) used guinea pigs vaccine trial **without informed trial might receive placebo**. step deliberately inoculating humans virus, still unethical. probably incidents countries current and, especially, historical, three countries come mind.

So, infectious dose extrapolated animals. This, course, limitations, do. experimenters work good handle doses use, usually something like particle/cm^3. 

As 'how much surface question' everyone working things routinely report surface area testing, obvious reasons. *always* done. useful science otherwise. 

As repeated touches looked light persistence infectivity said surface, and, perhaps importantly, much given concentration virus particles removed given surface touch. Let's take example. Suppose X equals number virions per square centimeter. suppose compliant rather weak minded volunteer puts finger immediately sticks nose breathes in. Suppose touch pulls 50% virions. summation (Σ) virions transferred Σ = (x/50)... (x/100)... (x/200).... (x/∞). repeated touching approach 100% never actually get it. iteration 5 level 1.56% concentration picked up, rapidly downhill there. kept mind assistant quickly dumping virus touch. 

With 'disinfection' methods become standard practice open question whether protection gained actually inactivating virus. much due simply washing wiping virus away. would interesting research comparison alcohol wipes versus water soaked fabric. products tested terms 'contact time' needed kill virus (between 3 10 minutes generally). area remain *wet* time. Spraying counter immediately wiping may close nothing beyond physical effects wipe. Well.

I’ve heard discussions week virology (TWiV) podcast don’t know - look later. seems dumb unless they've stopped receiving doses science debated

The science really debated masks. Stop spreading misinformation. closed vaccine sites today yesterday NYC blizzard. happen. “weeks end” exaggeration; worst storm years really bad one day yesterday. 32,780,860 total doses including 26,440,836 first doses 6,064,792 second doses 02/02/2021.

32,222,402 total doses including 26,023,153 first doses 5,927,847 second doses 02/01/2021.

558,458 doses administered (vs 806,751 01/26, 31%) including 417,683 first doses (vs 649,958 01/26, 36%) 136,945 second doses (vs 135,531 01/26, 1%).

Per CDC dose number determined nearly reported doses administered but, missing data dose number, sum people receiving 1 doses people receiving 2 doses exactly equal total doses administered.  many people politics important people. Neither side monopoly that. due low supply vaccinations extremely slow. There's alot shortage supply right especially EU That's point though. Nobody restricting - different priority groups. France saying frail vulnerable 90 year old vaccinated 64 year old should. Crazy. point stands too, politicians need stop handing chains chains independents. diversification always better plan. no, deal hand much cvs walgreens deal made behind closed doors without transparency. still lacks transparency, apparently problem with. Prioritize athletes getting vaccine limit crowds ok.  “Our vaccine supply schedule finalized even now,” Kono said.

I mean can't say affected finalised.... It’s worth headline news either. think referring something called “harvesting effect” looking read more. basically — probably degree. Many excess deaths year would died next 5-10 years now, since sadly died earlier, won’t. August based rhetoric Feds  Deaths per capita relevant statistic anyway. California significantly densely populated areas Florida well. Florida truly shithole vaccine supply schedule finalized even now,” Kono said.

Quote Independent article covering topic. EU caused vaccine doses delivered later date yet, made harder Japan plan logistics presume. planet think Andrew Yang hits Piggly Wiggly shopping? 
He moved Manhattan apartment couldn’t imagine working remote school small place. 
He probably couple people like normal person would got infected. likely fine. That’s literally asking. attributes could use.

Saying “the rest virus” means nothing SHONTS hospital Chicago mostly african-american staff. 71% said vaccine. right work said no.

There going large populations going act disease reservoirs. course risk everyone cases, mutations. going really robust data safety soon. emergency approval flip regular approval folks forced get jab lose jobs. could make argument vaccinating medical staff 65s vaccinated.

That terrible idea too. Maybe Cuomo co. should’ve never sent COVID patients nursing homes March/April. Wrong, CA recently passed FL per capita cases, although deaths per capita remain higher FL.


Average age FL also significantly higher FL elderly make vast, vast majority deaths. don’t think attributes virus would make vaccine? issue vaccines attacking spike already effectively mutating. Stop eating human brains. not? Lol wtf!! unlikely get normal summer Canada, unfortunately. expect clamour open border protected Americans, still vulnerable. fortunate 65+ population fully vaccinated summer. Israel see quickly vaccinating (1 world). 

Remember Israel still Gaza indiscriminate blockade [medical supplies, including continue agreed give 5000 doses Palestinian authorities, still word Gaza blockade free passage vaccines sources. Correct I'm wrong, whole country need vaccinated enable hurd immunity right? like 80% people rest get majority vaccinated? never live risk free world. Get it. Jobs! close borders? Probably same. Even countries good leadership trouble containing virus, think sentiment wearing mask optional “muh freedoms” would still pretty prevalent America don’t think comment integrity Singapore, it’s one guy saying dismissing info like China got everyone trouble 

I think issue guy education minister also sits covid task force. He’s actually expert subject field isn’t closely related curve flattened! Id say quite epic, match up. best vs. greatest time. That’s said mate Yeah agreed! think local news lesser evils though saying perfect either. I’m saying it’s fucking shitty NYT still paywalls reaction. says even notice needle. sounds normal phone! Straight dude. reddit stalked you. Coronavirus _ONLY_ thing participated reddit last 9 Months. things year ago. nothing 3 years ago.

Lockdown would easier things time upset people internet.

""Get Life""  Fill shit like it’s hot cup coffee McDonald’s.  Importantly, vaccines less effective preventing SA variant altogether, seems still lessen impact virus catch it. ideal, reasons somewhat optimistic.  argument applies literally every pathogen. People don’t die AIDS, die disease usually people AIDS otherwise immunocompromised people die of.

Also vaccine *does* work drastically reducing likelihood they’ll come contact someone contagious. good news! current moment means 7% country vaccinated. misreading something answer question saying ""no, yes."" things add up? terrible math? 🤣😄 *confirmed cases Flu's IFR 0.01% 30 year olds according keep calling narrow minded without argument evidence. Tell think opinion better weight scientific evidence. maybe open mind possibility clue USA USA 🇺🇸 I'd like think could done something defense production act, maybe could everyone US provided N95 mask Fall awful Winter (getting use may another thing entirely think could helped). Great news! caveat vaccinated CONFIRMED cases. Still, wanna take away feeling good something. One thing I'm excited for... gets control extensive work... MAGAts ""see, covid real! used make trump look bad!"" spiel BET DOLLARS JELLY DONUTS say that. always Cuomo Newsom speaks Dems, right? need look others managed handle better, easy pick scapegoats solid blue territory simultaneously demonize damn city elites. please write clearly hear confrontational asshole really trying understand riled up. Man. lost dad Covid hours ago. fought month succumbing damage. going get vaccinated too. Shit sucks :/ Fuck em, clear gene pool bit suggesting people protect employees? guy didn’t mention anti-vaxx. don’t know going me. think positivity “how well nations doing” crap it’s completely different situation. friends India, upper caste fine. leave lower castes fend essentially. Excellent.

I hope keep pace up. Reference Long Covid much issue? Ultra densely populated country lot young people. herd immunity looks like works. Notice we’ve heard nothing India strain smartphone element departments health track it? remember reading like pregnancy test could, theoretically, made easily interpreted. mean, makes sense, though adds lot cost Fortunately it’s mild-to-moderate symptoms. surprised able go full 10 months without getting it, 20 year old college campus bound run eventually. Wasn’t even massive college party either, casual contact friends. think people ""pretending"". given situation try stay business also reasonable without installing new air filtration systems saying ""the worst yet come"" current situation science-based. fear-mongering BS. :: cries Florida ::

I idea I’m supposed get vax state I’m clinging every word. I’m 65, lung thing. Called doc I’m waiting list. got one, too. CDC logo area vaccine info filled (on mine sticker Moderna vaccine lot number) date location got shot. getting second shot 5 days, pretty sure gonna add info second shot card. Anyone buys tries use one deserves strict sentence. Obviously people would use people test positive, intentionally knowingly putting people lives risk. Yep. vaccines haven’t approved anyone younger 16 don’t even need full 350 million. saw Biden saying everyone wants vaccine one end summer I’m seeing realistic path goal. It’s one thing order pay vaccine. It’s completely different get people 14 weeks?? 

That’s 98 million doses now. That’s basically vaccinating entire American population gets hospitalized thing. 

How could 14 weeks *possibly* part “worst yet come” part?   know 1/3 Americans already Covid, per CDC estimate right? Bend curve doesn’t mean fewer total cases, means less spike. We’ll get ~50% time dies down, pretty much heterogenous herd immunity models estimate herd immunity. difference, much one, total cases. western countries like UK US doing? say exactly?

I referring comment thinks variant escape vaccine immunity nothing No. 300 million people 65 India’s death rate would greater America’s herd immunity reached. Something else play here. Florida country, would rank:

- 18th world deaths

- 18th world deaths per capita

- 14th world cases

- 7th world cases per capita

Those low numbers. terrible numbers. despite fact serious issues data reporting. Specifically report non-resident cases, death reporting 2-6 weeks behind actual date death, criteria death reporting set higher bar countries do. 

Numbers Worldometers. would say it’s overall “tone” since took office specific actions manage things. example, I’ve heard anti mask/vax people (people know) desiring vaccinated listening science bit more. Confusing azz headlines. Stupid lol


Hold! I’m sorry, someone didn’t believe CNN’s prediction second wave? Vice President wrote oped condemn media saying going second wave. second wave. got worse summer. media right idiot hicks dismissed them. 328 million usa pop

So 82 million got covid

at .5% fatality rate thats 410k dead

close real figure 442K dead, stress much. shot anyone's arm good. may also qualified medical condition, occupation age Talk red tape. I'm sure there's reason would think company recourses get new drug FDA approved would able make call own. 

Almost seems like way big pharma dodges liability adds barriers entry time.  Ignore idiots. can’t accept failed pathetically. India literally tests 1 million people per day, second world great ruse apparently. Source? know opened up, 0% capacity  think ""herd immunity"" means think does. Wear mask per rules around strangers, otherwise feel relaxed less guilty social activities. OSHA saying sentences useless year. tests whole time? funding? WTF? also people who've virus immunity well.  glad you’re well. comment replied to, based neutral tone, made assume new changes life ones made without factors influencing you, like job loss mention. Oh wow amazing! Thank me! Remember least rn adults get vaccines, pulls large amount population. well interesting see social effects, vaccinated people act reckless social distance leading people break covid safe practices, need protocols around COVID vaccine trials they've studying immune response vaccines counter drugs well two decades. go Google rabbit hole results pretty mixed inconclusive.

The main question particular vaccine reacts drugs rather - much counter drugs suppress immune system.

Vaccine manufacturers, public health departments, CDC said anything either. even hint could impact it, we'd getting warning news articles. took advil shots side effects continued them.

While conjecture, take anything anticipation vaccine rather immune system responds it, probably safe take something. Yo guys I’m start dabbing Yeah worked well covid numbers deaths skyrocketed, economy crumbled, mental health pandemic ignored. Good job, everyone. i've read articles they're saying ***4-12 weeks now.*** 

yeah. curve trending down. things open up.

the new variant/s come in.. new surge?

not new. 

new ***improved.*** He's talking vaccines cases. storm def took hit today's numbers vaccines didn’t say you’re spreading misinformation. Singapore already using Pfizer vaccine.  recent case Finland gym equipment. several hour gaps customers got infected must surfaces. Yeah, saw someone IG feed this. 

I didn’t lose sleep it. can’t let perfect enemy good. happen, think try hard prevent it, over-thinking something isn’t *that* much problem. father would probably still alive. People want everything instantly get better Trump’s gone say “I told so”. believe US would’ve handled covid much better different leadership, still would’ve hit extremely hard. Biden seems moving things right direction, it’s going take time. CA open loosest sense word. still ton restrictions place, it’s like it’s free sudden. state still purple zone following limitations People fairly safely summer cases anyways.

Outdoor dining groups outdoors going fully acceptable summer. worst case scenario still cases bad spring, summer immunity higher it. take virus seriously I'm still taking reasonable precautions even though I've vaccinated, know look falling hospitalizations/deaths rising vaccinations argue ""the worst yet come"" good faith. fact said thing points may need education Finally.  Yes did. Biden really changed anything would noticeable effect point. I'm skeptical that's issue. 

NYC vaccinating large numbers people outside NY. I'm guessing cities too. anyone works NY lives NJ CT get vaccinated NY. really supply much more. Yeah except poors dying droves want covered up. Ah yes nothing vaccines cases finally going instead like poor areas there. might thought. Covid influenza airborne disease benefit would small. Small non-existent. shift supply overtakes demand. alone, lot suckers like us people 30, virus already low risk. makes sense take precautions help vulnerable, save best vaccines risk populations use good JNJ vaccine low risk folks. Giving another summer tiny improvement small group people beyond stupid. Life living. may have. vaccines ordered better distribution infrastructure. Sorry expecting perfect grammar casual online forum bud. understand can't dispute argue actual substance statement resort weak grammar insults. Sad. Oh fuck off, could easily people almost country, last story like see. silver lining crazy spread sped phase 3 timelines helped us get quicker approval vaccine donated Biden lol

But mean ignore reality. We’ll get point constraint supply. Mass vaccination sites set around country speed things massively. Single dose vaccines also instrumental speeding things up. bad, fixed Dr. Jah pretty good standards True, still sometimes forget stupid people are. nice thing ""I told so""s excellent shelf life. stay cupboard longer we've finished cleaning house.  without looking excess deaths, indeed exceeded half million then. nearly year constant detriment, news feels surreal. We’ve got long way go, great step! can't track study atm (it's somewhere r/covid19) Long COVID strongly correlated initial disease severity. Taking account, vaccine like J&amp;J's drastically reduce incidence Long COVID along deaths/hospitalizations Finally! Jesus Chris slow process far...  Yep.. remember plenty experts saying would take till second half year viable vaccine production.

Medical research produced absolute hail mary effort multiple highly effective vaccines people's arms less year.

The shortages predictable new product hugely demand, look huge efforts made trajectory vaccination rates, going done far sooner anyone could possibly hope.

 US gone 900 000 vaccinations day 1.3 million day first month additional federal money started flow- extrapolate improvements forward april/may they'll jabbing rate get done extremely fast, like end June guess.

The 'covid fake' 'we doooomed, hospitals collapse' positions simply two sides irrational coin. Compared six months ago, Humanity got virus balls. I'm lawyer know ""accomplice liability"" covers failure report crime would winter waves disappearing own? there's still people infect keep growing reach kind herd immunity, must either they're seeing herd immunity lockdowns/changes behaviour slowing spread.  know. Probably. doctor. play one TV. likely immunity laymen's terms means die. That's enough people resume old lives. Uhh ordered hundreds millions vaccines, think ones we're getting came from? I’d agree still seeing Trump vaccination plan. said, feel like even messaging makes optimistic. feel like new administration tell us truth aren’t gaslit. anxiety zero fucking clue veracity anything coming previous administration’s mouth refreshing. Hallelujah. know it’s close it’s damn good read positive news change. America! 65+ restrictions category, seem ahead curve. Maybe....just maybe ..... danger. least one immunologists quoted goes post-treatment well:

Generally called. guys weird. Stop self-absorbed. Unfortunately B117 (UK variant) likely going increase cases becomes dominant strain here. Hopefully enough people vaccinated it’ll hill mountain. country whole less 100 deaths. That's equivalent 25 deaths USA. Lol Congrats! thank volunteer work. second piece like David Leonhardt NYT. much needed counterweight pieces based anecdotes 'intense' side effects.  last year normal yours. LOL Yeah same. overheard volunteers talking getting vaccine. elderly; 60s 70s figured why. Got email volunteer coordinator inviting volunteers sign it. actually emailed asked sent accident. said no, eligible get volunteering. 

I know getting vaccine 30 minutes got earlier today. helping older folks find way vaccine clinic. offered vaccine clinic vaccinated. 

I volunteer hospital way build resume peace corps actually, vaccine never thought mind. Thought I'd waiting winter. though? always quantified statement with, nothing changes. 400k people died.  Waste not, want not. Thank fuck certain somebody gone. Tell you’re pos without telling you’re pos Came say this, like... WAY, really? Whats next, waters wet? Fires hot? Lol One potential pitfall I’ve heard nurses talk puncturing skin, test pull back (no idea why), proceed inject. process contaminating.

But honesty, it’s maximum sterile technique reasonable. reason hospital ORs reuse single-use items opened, even sitting side table, never used.   Terrible timing. virus already spreading unnoticed Western cities across world early March 2020 - lockdowns. happened time Purim, really fun Jewish festival everyone gets drunk parties. non-religious Jews don’t celebrate Purim, Haredis go really hard spread virus like crazy. things played week later, would St. Patrick’s Day would superspread COVID would way worse since way people party St. Patrick’s Day Purim. COVID seriously thrives joy fun. Yo, India deep pockets comes vaccines. Way go. got both, win?  like part plague inc blue bar growing know going lose- I'm happy real life believe source me? fact I'm still eligible yet despite job actively living people state get (NY citizens) shots extremely infuriating. problem. hope works you! Dude go drink me! 

Congrats! Right, we're getting closer every day. every vaccination brings us closer R0 &lt;1. wish gotten right vaccine roll starting happen. hope virus come bite butt later line, luckily really many symptoms headlines stories still worried. handing ivermectin, maybe proven last? Masks cause false sense protection, plus people tend touch face often would wearing mask, primarily western world culture mask wearing people incorrectly, potentially causing harm good.

But hopefully time learn use masks properly, touch faces masks times, know buy proper masks regulated understand wearing mask mean everything normally.  astounding, astonishing milestone. definitely proud 3?

Woah.  think 99% gone deep end, small fraction have. pretty sane. media pays way attention crazy ones makes comments (whether reasonable not) sound scarier pessimistic actually are. seeing Biden administration warn anything like that? I’m aware someone previously part transition team longer exists making claim. person said would need 500 million Ebola vaccines. 

Can please site sources claims? get solid Easter bunny year, promised. think idea depends fast body kills off.

If every time virus tries reproduce killed instead, vaccinated person can't transmit it.

But could maybe case virus reproduce day two body gets around killing off. might soon host symptoms, late stop transmitting.

I'm claiming one other, that's idea vaccinated person could theoretically spread it.  Got invited hospital receive kinda confused selected. I’ll take though. Chem 101 stops many hopeful premeds nursing school prospects.

Why? said factually correct friend. love people west virigina dumb soup good news you. Same.  Wait... really? David Muir told worry new variant!! going hinder vaccines!!!! mean tell PROBABLY fine whole time??? Well color shocked, tell ya, SHOCKED. need herd immunity reduced spread. Herd immunity end goal enough people immune literally cannot spread widely. 

That's spread slow. journey country on. Weird literally started watching show yesterday Actually, we've hit milestone. difference fewer cases fewer vaccinations. I'm sure part discussion side effects. hard interpret especially 1-2 per 10,000 patients. chance something vaccine did.

For us ""surviving"" middle east, even close over. Extra salt day night help. Also thigh high compression stockings snug pair spanx help.  mean, wouldn’t much assuring say “keep little longer restrictions gone!” know vaccines provide safety want encourage public keep distribute don’t make unvaccinated people feel left out.

I mean really hard truthful public?

It’s like people never talked another human life think maybe vaccines technically stop infected 100%, body fights becomes noticeable. get tested right time, might come back positive. guess depends ""infected"" means.

IIRC, Moderna BioNTech included symptomatic cases data showing effectiveness. Oxford one (I think) actively testing everyone study. saw significant amount people got vaccine test positive, showed symptoms.

So fear vaccinated people may able transmit it, short time, way asymptomatic cases can. think that's unlikely, know, seems data yet anyone know. New Zealand hit milestone like two shots vaccine  Exactly. [Martin Kulldorff's Twelve Forgotten Principles Public well worth important public health scientists officials listen public, living public health consequences. pandemic proved many non-epidemiologists understand public health better epidemiologists Slow buddy, vaccine shortages real fact many variants showing possibly mean unaffected vaccine. Little early planning international trips think also diabetics seem poor outcomes? crediting Biden premature. impact won’t kick couple weeks. 

This get better we’re past election team better.

This contradictory. Either we're already better new team Biden put better, also attributable Biden, we're better. 

We're clearly better. correct even better get bearings get plan place running, credit Biden put together team trying give credit all. People piss :( usual vagal reaction take moment manifest, BP drops lightheadedness sets in, etc.

As soon drops hit, eyes burned like crazy massively dizzy - felt like simultaneously falling chair pinned wall one spinning carnival rides. managed get (fortunately available) sink vomit passing out. Crazy hallucinatory dreaming influenced people trying talk (sometimes part reaction shots also). Loud ringing pounding heartbeat ears came around. reliably stand hour half. tear ducts (draining eye nose) burned good 24 hours.

Oh, biked appointment, getting home fun, too.

Since gotten air puff machine pressure test, far able examine retinas well enough without dilation. Contacts - despite worked lens factory! Temporary, brief shutdowns calm things specifically they’re bad, get bad. Makes sense. sense broad, panic-button shutdowns exit strategy besides vague, unquantifiable nonsense like “when it’s safe”. ...so much show. Bars packed live OK wear mask unless seated bar table. Covid spread sitting evidently. act. It'll probably go back bit week. Monday numbers always lower. trend continues definitely possible within week two. You’re Welcome \*Small loan million dollars\* yup. friend tested positive July, sick day so. even know positive, random test work place boss called 11 PM tell come work lol. 

She tested positive 2 weeks ago. symptoms, bit intense. (Body aches) 

She's 27. I’m United Methodist. We’ve Zoom since last March. I’d rather church close 1 person get COVID us. 

I’m sorry hear experience Christians. church almost millennials got burned religion. hope you’re better! Honestly support first come, first served vaccines point. work healthcare we’re giving patients risk score inviting top down, high risk elderly patients checking emails. Last time checked 20,000 received appointment invitation hadn’t done anything it. We’re send snail mail invites also putting people charge calling elderly people one one get come in. Could vaccinated far people done first come, first served thing.  Meanwhile NZ, know almost every case had, we've 25 deaths 2208 cases. IFR 1.13%. Basically exactly knew Diamond Princess whole year ago. Uh-oh, go citing Stanford studies illustrate reality voluntary measures effective mandatory studies. generalizing characteristics race useful, want racist.

Is generalizing death rates across age groups ageist? saying ""80 year olds higher death rate 30 year olds, vaccinate 80 year olds first"" discriminatory? gives shit think say. I'm ME, word teachers getting it, 70+ even I've heard much way happening. deletions spike UK variant though variants would it. That's pretty shitty must say Rathkeale Rovers cool fuckin name gang lol  No. What’s sensationalized forced gripe contrived percentages one who’s hospital virus gives two shits about. headlines trying explain people what’s going it’s like front lines. brutal truth. 

What get push back couch potatoes clue knee jerking response “ThE DeATh raTe lOw!! KiLLs oLd Peeple!!” don’t think SA variant two mutations hes mentioning that’s Y453F gene whatever. binds mink ACE2 4 times affinity. Although B.1 lineage thought developed prior mink variant. Dude find somebody dating app sext with. free much satifying. That's 10% population. Yet 74 year old parents still can't get one... part pandemic game know going lose. Yay   Best news since thing started. Good ol' hygiene theater. can't believe still thing many months known better. make people feel better, guess. Emotions. thing decline signs stopping. Declines always find ways reverse within days, especially variants discovered recently. 

Look Spain's numbers. among first large wave Fall, worst yet point. began recovering wave, within weeks worse ever going despite declines countries. 

This could easily future. Temperatures going get warm enough another 30-60 days people get outdoors more, school another 100 days so. Many challenges chances go back wrong direction. Apparently. deleted comment lol We’ve pretty good news year though  Well, here’s thing. SA/BR variant also gain deletions spike keep mutations. would aid complete immune evasion would need new vaccine. Given rolling vaccine/lockdowns, going put extreme pressure virus pick whatever continue spreading. also wasn’t thought lineage would develop mutation...yet are. 

We still prepared, thing thrown many wrenches solutions two months time. wouldn’t put past continue. That's like taking shower cure bad breath.

World omelet makes think giant omelet neopets lmfaooooo real risk assholes keep virus churning population low levels long enough spit vaccine resistant strain. we’re back square one. Sad poorly Canada doing. Trailing developed world economically vaccinations per capita. 

To make matters worse, everyone thought Biden would better Canada, turns hems not. much US focused ‘buy American’ policy well stopping Keystone XL going really hurt Canada’s economy. Combine horrible domestic policies never seen levels debt means next years quite horrible. amend bit, Biden order actually, summer AFAIK, probably correct current vaccine milestone due Biden, unless improvements rollout already come fruition, would doubt. Well obviously one person 30's died covid. sensationalized says thats ""brutal truth"". People unfamiliar statistics read actually think people 30's serious danger dying covid. That's bad/sensational media tactics. Americans wearing masks properly February 2021 ""not culture mask wearing,"" ""needing time learn"". They're due stubbornness disinformation. One test reusable? No. Ellume COVID-19 Home Test single use test cannot reused. say don’t believe proper assessment made people sub. actually disagree quite lot assertions disagree teachers somehow holding want lazy.  Eh want pfizer moderna vaccine. Fuck give 95% located? 

I’m AZ we’re already rolling teacher group - I’ve got first shot staff school either gotten one dose scheduled soon You’re right. government harm. always right best interest mind. single use: FAQ: test No. Ellume COVID-19 Home Test single use test cannot reused. rich enough, old enough get vaccine, anytime soon. Rough estimates me, family April. 

So damn frustrating losing everything, watching folks found way get go back normal. That’s great people following guidelines. everyone is. Watching younger folks got family hospital administrators, bs like doesn’t really help faith humanity. It’s still know. “extras” told people, they’re right place right time. I’ve told life doesn’t matter, believe see people skipping line. time get help, it’s going matter. We’ll streets. It’s really hard, year isolation, hate everyone. FINALLY record proud much 15% people getting sick vaccine fully effective (apparently somewhere around 49 days)?

I'd like know know staying quarantine extra seven weeks keep virtually 100% safe.

Not I'm eligible vaccines near future. mutation already SA variant vaccines still fairly effective. Maybe person put tv.

That's simplistic short-sighted way see this. actually turns helpful convincing people get vaccine, showing fine speaking directly public nurse. like pro-gun person gets shot, recovers, continues staunch proponent Second Amendment. I'm high risk group signed get vaccine ASAP. I'm happy take it.

One thing makes angry least jurisdictions, folks jump line claims true.

""I daycare worker."" (person retired, watches grandchild week.) really gets me. people risk lives, jumping line? ... .. yeah talk again.  Herd immunity vaccination meant protect can’t vaccinate well. enough people take vaccine, think will, can’t vaccinate able move society level confidence incidents infection isolated. 

TLDR: We’re killing it’s ability get you. Fuck Zuck

Fuck Facebook. 

Delete Facebook accounts Hi, saw flair, felt good place ask. sure seeing cases fall vaccination? week ago, 3% population vaccinated. 9% high risk population. cases falling vaccinations working, cases fall finally cleared “Christmas New Years Death Zone” many people know better disregarded public health guidelines holiday general COVID fatigue. referring false positive number, 91% accurate, meaning closer 1/10 false positives. There's going ton false positives tests scale test. Everyone would still need 2nd test confirm.

And sick, stay home self-quarantine. Getting positive test result really change behavior. get EVP level corporation, see sociopaths function firsthand. Unfortunately many positions public office. ""conspiracy theory"", human nature desire power others. trust home test lab procured one. look FAQ thing, there's lots things could make invalid.  Sooo exact symptoms got I'm glad I'm one! turned 30 volunteer nursing home received vaccine. Onward herd immunity! Um digital lol, would create database vaccinated. government trying desperately salvage 2021 Olympics. 

Spoiler Alert: ain’t happening E484K mutation allows virus neutralize 9 11 major antibodies natural immunity vaccine creates. reason spikes essentially shifted ‘up’ position. natural immunity/vaccine equipped ‘down’ position.

What really troubling this, read blog day someone SA/BR variant picks deletions spike UK variant, would need entirely new vaccine work. Low behold, missing K417N/T gene. 

But another similarly worse gene variant pick N439K gene binds human ACE2 twice rate. Aiding N501Y another 50% increase virulence humans. Making R0 11.4. European variants already this. thought substitute K417 mutation could still occur also aids immune evasion. much focus *deserves* get vaccine, argument could made least deserving vaccinated first i.e. socialites don’t take precautions spread virus widely. yeah, it’s good vaccinate person youths going around old folks. kind church? know wife’s faith important her, used me. get pride go church her. can’t go one wrong evil one grew one grew in. know Christians awful ones grew around. can’t another 1-2 years figuring another cult. fact opposite capitalism, it’s government funded. Great news! Finally decent milestone first time since bullshit started. PS can’t believe used let people breathe public! Hahah Yeah, that's definitely part we're seeing west too. 

The City LA houses big vaccination centers around 4 million people, county whole 10 million. San Diego, population around 1 million, greater county around 3 million. So, lots demand surrounding areas well. That’s anyway. vaccines reduce worst symptoms cold-like symptoms...then cares get it? Looking numbers, could seriously sub 100k case day soon next week so. federal government didn’t provide leadership get US. also put place international lockdowns strict quarantine, would disastrous didn’t place.

Are stroke something? I'm literally losing live here.

I hope dramatic need find way socialize something. Go walks something.  Disagree. Trump still charge, country would ripping apart gets vaccine first, Trump leading charge.  Thanks. Almost 100k dead month still pretty damn crazy. Again, you’re using terms like majority talking percentages...


... ignoring crazy high transmission rate makes seemingly small percentages turn really large numbers real HUMANS... SUFFERING AND/OR DYING “Got admit it’s getting better/ little better time”

Aaaand think I’m gonna binge Beatles albums tomorrow work.

(Also can’t believe long one referenced yet...) I'm scareeeeeed, covid get 😢😱😱😱😱😱 might uninformed, sorry. I'm sure percentages coming from. support vaccines looking forward getting see sister child.

On googling, I'm finding little info asymptomatic positive cases are, there's overlap presymptomatic false positive rapid tests. confusing.  I’m unexpected good milestone! sound like shitty friend, hes better without you.  link since public record?  It’s so... refreshing? that's anecdotal. massive majority 40 years olds totally fine. estimated 40% asymptomatic. Meanwhile, Canada... reach 450k day two ago wouldn’t *this bad*  100% correct, appreciated clarify things anyone else reading. :)  Ooo....

Vaccine whack-a-mole taken turn expecting much later 2021. Brisbane based Australian company give credit Trump? 😂    Yes, said infected sick wouldn’t affect numbers reported. Publix distributing vaccines county, think. technically logged 6 made appt, logged night kept website on, quietly put virtual queue. First come, first serve. check Osmosis No, they'll wait outside.   Low life expectancy. people make 70. Thus lower number vulnerable people. Government longer tests people get test pay. one bothering test. two combined factors means virus burned out. Based study purports show risk lumping American Indian/Alaskan Native together versus Whites. find data generalizing characteristics race useful, want racist.  rate decay slows drastically numbers get lower. Going 30k 15k takes significantly less going 15k 0 Awesome. knew took enough break place eventually something good would happen Yes key believe mutated Parallel evolution similar development trait distinct species closely related, share similar original trait response similar evolutionary pressure.

Meaning prepared US experience exact phenomenon.  know well. Let's hope 1st doses come sooner rather later years Im really sure you’re asking? 

89% efficacy preventing symptomatic infection very, good. puts similar plain mRNA vaccines.

60% actually better yearly flu vaccine 

As far I’m aware it’s determined tabulating displayed zero covid symptoms [Why people keep *saying*  Moderna father law today. Keep going! what's saying? nothing changes worst still come? yes case infected test positive think rise faster-spreading variants (such UK one) going cause another spike? “Experts Say Nursing Home Deaths Can’t Possibly Get Worse Already Are!” Christian pastor here. Ditto. positive NC went one worst 10 states country vaccine administration administering almost first doses.

The negative cancelled appointments Greensboro Durham minimal notice reallocated doses mass vaccination sites Charlotte boost numbers get higher future allocations. equity across state there

I get help NC, time can't help feel irked way governor went people gathering Thanksgiving/christmas/new years. simply less opportunities spread. Thank medical science, cool. expecting 500k dead something  Uhm, no. national mandate would incredibly unconstitutional huge overstep power. 

You can't give federal government control like ever expect give up. That's got stuck TSA Patriot Act. ""Vaccines help protect infected get it""

This one sort legit, post exposure vaccine real thing, rabies tetanus particular. However, vaccine take time work, protection apply cases long incubation periods infection vaccination happen relatively close together. Yes, it’s best pluck eye now. Abolish Oh 100% agree what’s she’s saying. saying though doesn’t seem case novel mutation; it’s mutation already identified variants 

It’s like suddenly covid developed mutation made turn green wasn’t previously identified Seriously? headline true. guys keep throwing low percentages never talking virus super contagious. Ie even looks like low percentages, shit ton people become infected, little percentage becomes real measurable number.

Source: gf 31 normal weight good health. Covid steamrolled December spent 8 nights hospital struggling breathe. hell. didn’t die doesn’t fit statistics.

Anyone gone looks guys assholes. Symptomatic infection already fairly low. I'm curious tabulated data determine percentage symptomatic prevention. It’s pretty cringe tbh. evident start, media still stuck ""we know"" narrative despite fact almost every vaccine existence behaves way. 'Based' linguistically reads like insult reason, say something bad. I'm sure why, word come praising something me.  moderators assholes reddit. posted state sub coronavirus said post sub. Next week see similar post concerning coronavirus state sub. double standard cases moderators remove content agree like it. TV people kept telling bodies gonna pile streets.

Could ~~bloggers~~ *JoUrNaLiStS* exaggerating fear views/clicks? read part people taking precautions before. take precautions indefinite amount time wanted live lives, there's end sight lot people feel like would shame catch now, they're trying to. feel conflicted can't vaccinate stay home anymore  say giving agriculture I’m trying figure ways around lockdown people don’t starve don’t get sick either Demographics interesting less 6% 65 half population 25 according article.

Well vaccines work, efficacy lower preventing symptomatic infections, identical preventing severe cases hospitalizations. 

Like novavax vaccine roughly ~89% effective preventing symptomatic infection UK variant ~60% effective SA variant preventing symptomatic infection, 100% effective preventing severe illness required hospitalization death variants.

(As Novavax trail often see figure 49% cited, that’s completely accurate signifiant chunk people trial HIV positive; big problem SA ~20% population HIV positive, much issue Europe/Western world even outside Africa really) remove HIV positive group efficacy around 60%  That's nasal one, yes, nasopharyngeal one 10cm longer make eyes water. logic that? vaccines rolling out, even make sense. know dude. quoting Time fine people single mask only?

Or medicine come along that's better? something else? believe true. many news articles saying otherwise especially NY.
Oh no, ban time. know virus fragments decreased 100 times hour. heard would great true decreased fast. Could provide link study? Honest question, long expected take vaccine 99%+ people America? can’t wait day unsub subreddit.. really makes want laugh considering know great deal intelligent people who’ve probably done better people I’ve met state, it’s even apparent I’ve state people masked everywhere places.

They following fucking guidelines Justice put it, sound like absolute paper weight human being.  We're everywhere. Reddit. 💎🤲  I'm sure that's true. would expect vaccination rates arbitrary region follow distribution, group together regions rates converge mean. means expect small states best worst large states tend average.  people sub ones vocal beginning. Nowadays daily brigade so-called lockdown skeptics. already vaccinating 1mil people day Trump. Biden genius thing said he’ll make sure vaccinate 100mil first 100 days. literally nothing keep current plan moving. 

Trump busy Trump couldn’t even tout vaccination program success, giving easy Biden first 3 months. response say ""mRNA vaccines adapted matter days""?

My thought forgetting complex logistics required get vaccine people, take significant amounts time, even streamlined now. got first dose last night awake feeling shit - flu symptoms, fever, aching. that’s slice people experiencing heart breaks even more. it’s nice knowing it’s reaction I’m actually ill. Hope horizon! find get vaccine? someone going contact notify way, need keep calling? call? I'm US.

It seems haphazard like testing little guidance availability. can’t believe something positive US hit front page...     way. Two weeks moderna, one week Pfizer. get second shot Pfizer couple weeks.

So slight chance would still get infected, immunity vaccination still help fight disease. Keep mind trials vaccines include ""high risk"" people. virtually nothing worry vaccination Mental illness people get ""information ""?

Alex Jones. He's literally telling audience vaccine kills people. WTF. massive government failure president's inability role model, oh no. guy Reddit misses gym.🙄 Texas hasn’t dropped anything. still statewide mask mandate many counties capacity restrictions. finally received vaccination card first Moderna vaccine. know anything makes hard fake. carry passport sure! stories get clicks mean revenue. Well, propose compromize:

Half capacity k-8. Online high school. High schools become vaccination centers district staff.

Everything talked applies prepubescent kids. data shows pubescent teens definitely get spread virus like anyone else.

source: interesting point article indicates plenty children gotten covid, suggests children half likely get covid as. People age 10. *In opinion, means puberty possibly plays role, neat*

If children half likely get covid teens adults, makes perfect sense I've suggested.

You’re going way pessimistic, odd want optimistic. said would stop wearing mask everyone wants vaccine get one, includes kids. Idk promised would eventually get 0 community spread literally never happening guy. virus endemic always going around form another, every health expert said. want wear mask end time go ahead. deal though? Guy said lot people die it. true, strange 45% deaths came 0.6% population then. short-sighted comment. 80% effective preventing hospitalisations would still great result implication would 1000s lives saved. matter whether there's somebody ahead of. issue bonkers expose there's enough vaccines protect them. ‘smile’. states done vaccinating nursing homes residents. don’t see deaths vanish within weeks we’ll know vaccines don’t work well people weak immune systems. infirm people included vaccine trials. Right, I’m suggesting massive government investment every stage process.

This didn’t start last week. We’re year this. can’t improve production fucking glass years lead time, don’t deserve produce this.

I’m sorry, hadn’t playing building dozen new carriers 1943, that’s going happen. fucking glass jar.

Increase raw material supplies. Build new glass blowing plants. New vial making plants. it. Money object all.

Seriously, imagine suddenly make lots something actually complex. Moderna approved forget Since nutcases sleep 5 hours night one anecdote hundreds people conclusively proves worldwide indoor spaces types? mean... say going stop wearing mask kids vaccinated? said would stop everyone wants vaccine gotten one. unreasonable goal post. Otherwise wearing masks perpetuity. want wear mask 0 recorded COVID cases world go ahead endemic virus going away anytime soon Thank you. school year look different since easing homeschool. kids seem much less stressed.

I hope able vaccinated soon, truly appreciate everything bottom heart person online. need 80% vaccination herd immunity US.

I think 70% want get living lives. Another 10% follow due peer pressure. expect another 5% 10% job makes mandatory able claim unemployment benefits get vaccination.

I'm worried getting 80% vaccine available sufficient quantities. ban meeting people outside they're acting outrageously. nearly 1/10 positive results incorrect test? seem ideal. wouldn’t Reddit didn’t obsess numbers headline instead seeing bigger picture. ""Loving spoonful"" approach guess. amazing going 5 6 doses increases 20%, 6 7 another 17%.

It big news federal government increased vaccine distribution states last week 16%. nurse spare time.

Hopefully become far widespread. Lockdowns successful Australia, asked citizens whether they'd overwhelming majority would say yes, heartbeat.
Half baked lockdowns used last resort disaster, get argument score. market prices, China Russia might willing give serious discount exchange construction projects and/or supporting China political issues. Belt Road Initiative countries almost certainly get discounts. going Americans saved world using vast military power virus, lead grizzled general Faucci. Also forgot annoying subreddit thread post anything approaching common sense and/or science. didn’t say person shouldn’t hug healthy grandma. indeed good news.

Soon, knuckleheads getting vaccinated clogging hospitals. I've heard lot people got moderna. got pfizer literally can't even notice got vaccinated. I'm wondering general trend forgotten long Covid heart damage? narrative already prepared. bad? Bless heart. hope state prioritizes teachers vaccine able return.  wonder much airborne inoculum. Almost HALF recruits tested positive COVID arriving Parris Island. amount SARS-CoV-2 flying around air barracks must immense; basically 6-week-long superspreader event. seropositive individual exposed lower inoculum, like typical pick COVID outside homes, would likely turn positive PCR? Regardless, pretty solid evidence wisdom vaccinating everyone, including people previously tested positive.  I'm PAC 12 guy yes, get lol  Oh god, get high horse. making masks permanent staple lives post COVID added utility wearing facial covering protect tiny sliver people CAN'T get vaccinated greater pre-pandemic. Ignoring fact talking period vast majority people vaccinated community spread brought extremely low levels, absolute number people would risk severe COVID would likely marginally larger number people risk latent viruses circulation.

Wearing mask ""unbearable burden"" inconvenience gladly put protect others large risk public health currently. longer abnormally large risk public health beyond small subsection population benefit wearing mask longer enough justify time.

When end point general mask wearing? COVID cases 0? never going happen, endemic never going away. want live life 2022, 2023 judging VACCINATED people wearing masks thats you. Vaccinating vulnerable 0.6% (nursing home residents) addresses 45% deaths. don’t need get anywhere near 50% vaccinated get almost people high risk groups vaccinated. question vaccines work well people weak immune systems, people make vast majority Covid deaths (and included vaccine trials). Hope works cuz I'm really getting tired shit.

I love this, exact sentence crosses mind times day. Still others? creepy bug.  idea outlets like CNN pushing dreary, gloomy ""never going back normal and/or lockdowns months/years"" narrative? 1.2% pretax income apparently. 

They probably pay 10-20x more. would say Trump's inept response yes sure, blame China's greed. China's fault US infected nation world /s Let’s go!!! Either way antibodies likely activated, educated guess would say would make less sick. would love hear opinion someone expertise this. Pull bootstraps man! Big Ten football anyone? AZ vaccine cheap gets. Currently 90% fatalities 15% population, vaccinated, fatalities drop 90%. happens virus far less deadly, really might ""just flu"".

Here article explains Covid could become basically common That’s true unfortunately. thing is, IFR still 5.4% 70 - definitely major risk, much lower think believe doom gloom social media.

If 85-year-old grandma wants take risk misses family, deny that. doesn't, respect that. Everyone decide risk tolerance - allowed to. government place telling us see families friends.  don’t think it’s people like affect much. people hyper sanitized already they’ve completely eliminated germs lives. It’ll interesting.  pandemic relief check, stimulus check, meant help stimulate economy. Giving everyone benefits economy severely impacted zombie apocalypse! Living covid-centered lifestyle 11+ months sustainable all. need find ways deal virus involve destroying peoples livelihoods mental health. don’t open borders year half haven’t started vaccinating yet? Right? wow, what's stark difference democrats republicans difference *both* perceptions reality. as, overestimate deaths 24 age group almost two orders magnitude Exactly. Yeah wish people understood last point, particularly “not eradicate virus” Hugs you. similar situation. However, engaged children, haven’t seen four months (which still feels like lifetime.) incredibly strong. Holding onto comment reminder it, it! hope family united soon possible. necessarily care getting covid, care people dying.

People also care whole lot transmitting virus people care about. stands reason ones less effective catching virus also worse spreading it. There's lot crazy people there, apparently fuck like rabbits never seem run them.

This premise Idiocracy. You’re applying logic people grasp.

I agree tho unless stretegy laid enforced, folks going hop around. still try. good summary state mRNA vaccine supply US. Pfizer Moderna lagging behind Q1 delivery targets, Pfizer currently slower one. companies recently affirmed believe ramp hit Q1 target 100m doses delivered - Pfizer believes hit 120m end Q1. companies expecting lot total delivered towards end quarter. No, try mindful wash hands I'm done preparing kind food even cutting cheese fruit. here, effecient, least 5 people stopped leaving, making sure appointment second shot. like optimism little paranoid first month pandemic otherwise never wipe anything. sanitize good measure I’m super concerned ... yes, know.

[There interesting interview one authors opines elimination strategies better mitigation strategies returning normal life. seem like fair summary JAMA piece all. honest agree, know getting downvoted. 6x decrease Moderna holds, titers get area Sinovac vaccine 50% effective. Depends expectations were. try listen Federal updates MGen Fortin Minister Anand updated information. guess redditors and/or media outlets might get expectations high.

The good news best case scenario actually 46M doses end Q2. could vaccinate 23M Canadians keep mind less 32M Canadians even eligible. would 70% population.

Brilliant analysis. stock definitely buy month? always thought getting vaccine like gaining small super power... evil darkness whopping cough useless me.  That's important recognize. what's *reported*, usually *reporting* actually *happened* weekend.

But people update data stuck home today... thaw vial, use hours. beginning vaccine distribution, whole process rostering people, filling syringes, jabbing, finding replacements no-shows etc less efficient, smaller vials meant less waste flexibility. vaccination scales made high throughput, vials made hold doses too.

Anybody comparing covid spanish flu lost plot. vaccines seem effective still maybe quite much. natural.immunity covid may be. What? warp speed supposed change weather doesnt snow? Like people cant get vaccination place, cant get vaccinated? parallels Iraq amazing. Yeah, sole inland country there. also quite authoritarian country 2. People used conditions apply jobs.

I wonder gap number people vs number positions filled next days time touch package/container fridge, wash hands again? haven’t wiped groceries done anything special deliveries since started. Neither people know. work industry public information source

Attitude. ""Just 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 2% fatality"". Humans shit evaluating risk. whole thing exercise terrible risk management. unknown disease unknown long-term consequences? Fuck it, let's go herd immunity.

The successes evaluated risk correctly: would everything could, people wait out. happen live places well salute sacrifices rest world made past year know long-term continue die fact.

I I’m thankful number vaccinated. Yes smarter people right 

Im biologist experience studying virology. It’s highly, highly unlikely virus mutate lethal. runs counter evolutionary theory. Viruses use humans (and animals) vectors/hosts. evolve kill host efficiently you’re actually contributing extinction. It’s like symbiotic organism suddenly developing mutation kill symbiote feel optimistic too. get 65+ population vaccinated, hospitalizations deaths plummet. I'm hopeful happen April. much. government won’t let try something, you’ll get publicly shamed.

Mahomes vs Brady pretty great match mind. says profile she'll take breath away... stellar piece Times... even media shifting goalposts positively. 

If you’re paywalled ya gotta read: 

“Dr. Ashish Jha, dean Brown University School Public Health, told weekend: “I don’t actually care infections. care hospitalizations deaths long-term complications.”” got Moderna vaccine doses, obviously I'm still gonna mask public socially distant, less clear now?

can somebody ELI5 changes doses? Yes, country claims eliminated virus yet recently put capital lockdown. virus must popped trees. Clinton would gotten fuck way let science rule. 

Why know this? dems actually believe science. vaccine supposed stop covid. bother drinking cure? I'm looking diagram think even dad gets. think I've getting nasal one

Even today news new E484K variant, CNN article saying party 2024, Biden’s advisor saying next 6-14 weeks worst yet. need unplug. wonder many people legit unaware inching closer bars/clubs/restaurants, concerts, theatres, beaches, amusement parks opening 100% without mask requirement. Worse yet, I'm wondering many people enjoying much want things reopen. point isn’t whether accurate not- public health officials ethical forthcoming still move goalposts due nature situation happens repeatedly long period time, people feel less willing trust them. 

I’m entirely sure done prevent it, suspect lot people would resilient around changing goalposts whole situation hadn’t handled poorly along. left us exhausted, frustrated, lot less ability continue trusting despite constant flip flopping. Humans aren’t entirely rational.   Disaster. Yeah, certainly. necessarily think even horrible health care, that's part (look UK reference think that).

I think mostly culture. stereotype Americans internationally care first, family second, rest world damned. extreme individuality lack compassion endemic many parts country, births racism, anti-vaxxing, anti-masking.

It takes active encouragement think community whole order make people things inconvenience themselves, like wear masks. party power encouragement high make real difference impact less informed areas.

There less 20,000 hospitalizations US since last March. start looking number. We're 100,000 right now, went like 30k January. suppose depends mean end pandemic. 

If ""deaths covid tiny fraction life back normal people"" 4-5 years wildly pessimistic, accurate estimate would gradually move toward point next 6 months. 

If ""covid eradicated"" 4-5 years extremely optimistic timeline, accurate estimate would ""in billion years, mammals extinct"".  agree. also would like able take quite newborn anymore older kids just...somewhere. don’t go anywhere. miss feeling safe living every day. Isn’t goal? Ha ha

Reach herd immunity via vaccine. 

Unless heard wrong. Otherwise google “at home COVID saliva test” find sites sell test. old people give flying fuck ""recommendations"", one. voluntary recommendations work. gonna old people complaining can't live final years freedom. i've actually heard something along lines floridian reddit, trying incense pandemic response saying give old people dignity.

so then, even that, may step forward, let's go it. risk immunocompromised people working age? people 60s still working putting bread table? multi generational households cannot isolate elderly? long covid sufferers? risk mutations? problem complex. nobody actually tried this, far know. come? 

anyways, see may something it. apparently matter discussed uk members house lords argued would age discrimination.

i disagree ending. lockdown? I’m extremely excited turn. Yes, WSJ report, Ultra Orthodox Jews Israel shown photo 1000s attended funeral rabbi died Covid. Yet, people photo wore mask certainly keep social distance. thing happened NY rabbi's funeral. NY, still attend religious ceremonies. Without mask distancing, hard imagine virus got free rein crowds. Ellume's at-home tests appear antigen test: at-home tests great news help greatly, important note antigen tests sensitive PCR tests many testing sites provide. like never read Boy Cried Wolf need isolate forever lockdown properly. done right beginning, US would rolling lockdowns far time spent public instead terrible half ass lockdown state. Pessimists unite! go ""gets worse"" phases Closed borders maybe forever normality though. you’re MN free via vault health. advice I'm seeing go ahead take *after* vaccine, *if* feel really bad feel like need them. basically, wait long enough see there's benefit taking anything. many people, strong symptoms vaccine. I’ve read one South Africa little tougher vaccines effective against. still efficacy, it’s absolutely still worth getting vaccine, vaccine bit less effective South Africa strain. Hoping keep getting vaccines arms people hang little longer stay large social circles don’t keep giving thing chances mutate even more. can’t wait it’s turn get vaccinated, won’t yet. headline kinda accurate.

Yes, that’s she’s saying, majority article actually vaccinations. Even problematic variant, South African, every single vaccine still 100% effective preventing death hospitalization lowest we’ve seen 57% effective symptomatic infection. think it’s possible, probably likely see surge early spring. gonna like two cars driving full speed, virus vs. Vaccine, vaccine win given data want there? sort fetish? Coming conservative WSJ. Breaking news: respiratory virus causes respiratory symptoms China, lovely believable country Np! People disgusting. COVID become thing past 6 months right. Bingo. Ding ding ding thing called vaccines... clearly sustainable economy significantly better, oh way life basically back normal there.  diomers? Ramping manufacturing wouldn’t net results circulation within week. That’s manufacturing sector works, especially medical equipment. That’s good move, course, largest player piece news.  

As source listed states, Trump administration able hit 985k/100d rate, startlingly good holds lion’s share credit now. It’s issue giant vaccination centers themselves. 

They scare people, old people problem utilizing walking. predict culture shift vaccines widely administered severe cases / deaths (variants included) virtually none: catching virus longer terrifying battle could land ICU casket. 
It’ll crummy cold like bug people see another mildly annoying 2021 experience. epidemiologists predicting this. thought US used mRNA vaccines far? Optimistic. Vaccination rates increasing case hospitalization numbers decreasing. Stating blindingly obvious, making group afraid get vaccination bad everybody.

Was ICE pro-COVID announcement? necessarily gone waste. plenty stories lately pharmacies giving extra doses people happened around end day. also see nothing wrong vaccine hunters doing. figure willing sit line day, probably good reason getting vaccine.  email like could look spammy. tested sending?   They’re definitely quite stupid

It’s bottom 5 education almost every metric happen state red. 

And people moving states blue avoid poverty. 

I don’t think understand country already lives few, any, restrictions. 

Hell, states ALREADY large events like nfl games audience. Jeff Goldblum entered chat vaccinated early? master degree, deserve protection Covid? Lots people concerned US, strain also supposed dominant March. major test us getting vaccine reducing spread. Selective pressure may make UK variant adapt pick E484 mutation like UK yesterday. Nothing certain anymore. Toddlers even unhygienic, day care workers still work. teachers special? ^ brand new account, karma, defending anti-vaxxers. 

Yeah. you’re gonna swallow blatant propaganda full-throated? UK's figures improved lot 18000 cases 400 deaths yesterday. 9.2 millions vaccines shots delivered. Ah, gets credit mistakes. Let’s apply standard life see measure up. Surely needs part requirement needed work carehome? Must vaccinated disease kills elderly... Yes please. personally care either found many vaccines started telling states could plan appropriately.

There plan distribution know much two weeks ago. shit matters.

Everybody mothers knew SARS-CoV-2 airborne latest early March. local health authorities insisted mid-summer last year. [More 200 scientists shake admitted ""there probably airborne transmission.  asymptomatic transmission.

Yeah, I've reading people actually symptoms. thing crazy shell spike proteins... wild.  says something completely different week surprised. expected... disruptive enough close gates, arrested? Figured might went. Damn Either way, seems like there'll tsunami vials headed end March that's pretty amazing. idea there's significant number people thinking we'll never go back normal true. Everyone wants over.

i understand people stressed, tired restrictions, etc, idea people wearing masks avoiding activities generally want pandemic end one nastier comments gets passed around. 

in fact pretty isolated pandemic, that's made pandemic worse me, pulling social resources had. despite still try cautious want actions pandemic lead anyone's death.

i sure really people enjoying pandemic, doubt many. information source? Need reply misinformation Facebook feed  No, point correct herd immunity SARS forgot mention Asian people learned SARS. pointed out. words, I'm talking risk individual healthcare system.

If 1000 vaccines disposal, mitigate risk health care system, cannot jab 1000 people arbitrarily chosen group largest absolute numbers. statistics 101. age group 55-70 arbitrarily chosen, could well 55-60, 60-65, 65-70 three separate groups.

You ensure vaccine goes 1000 individuals highest risk clogging health care system. people 85 older, first vaccinate people 85 older.

That's first vaccinated UK, Margaret Keenan, 90 received jab (has turned 91 now).

In case Finland, tell 75 older, may totally fine depending vaccine availability. probably depend factors age well, example convenience - putting nursing home residents single category means vaccination team go nursing home once.

Depending daily available shots high-risk group through, may totally fine say ""first come first serve"", cannot say ""everyone age 63 jab week May 7th July 14th, everyone age 62 jab week May 15 July 21st."" works badly making airplane passengers board ""window seats first, middle seats, aisle seats"". Expect many people come jabs complete household.

As said, largest risk group Germany 40 million people currently expected takes three months vaccinate all. day earlier later slightly at-risk person mean much grand scheme things there, especially summer months.   Sinopharm tested already?  Actually wait, nevermind.

I realised you’re missing lot backstory misinformation won’t understand without context. guess must think I’m one trying spread misinformation.

I polish exactly misinformation is, claim is, evidence completely debunks claim present reader-friendly format.  wish system better organized this. stay available get called last minute, people clearly higher priority me. system could automate matching people left doses would huge. USA! USA! 🇺🇸  stop clicks stop. anyone doubts it, read [fearmongering CNN today. End beginning! parties till 2024! 

These academics need fuck back ivory towers news needs stop giving much airtime. Eh- store people find reassuring. It’s big deal, place looks smells nicer. also wear masks try maintain social distancing. People still touch masks, adjust glasses, etc... hand sanitizer available wiping surfaces doesn’t really hurt anything. alcohol wipes use wipe credit Cards handed me. client clean card! also love using phone.  


Since also leaving doors open increased ventilatio, also increased dust everywhere- extra cleaning works out. cut store hours close hour early make sure time get everything wiped down. Everyone still gets full time hours get time finish chores. Win/win. population wants going want mRNA vaccines, hack job media done. cooler heads prevail, assure impact lockdowns ""covid lives saved"" small number. orders magnitude.... like ""4 million dead US"" vs ""400,000"". like ""450,000"" vs ""400,000"".

And frame terms quality adjusted life years, used medical ethicists forever.... QALY lockdowns negative number. give 0.5% population years extra life we've deprived everybody year life.

The math lockdowns favorable all. Covid myopia shown far destructive covid.

PS: Comparing WWII deaths covid deaths viewed QALY shows disingenuous comparison is. average age WWII deaths teenagers. Covid's average age like 83. cannot compare two. CNN literally headline today said “it’s end beginning”

I like...what?? many people gotten covid get shot wanted save people? I'd assume bit types people. r/conspiracy would say would say r/conspiracy would say otherwise

r/conspiracy would say otherwise We'd milestone week earlier? LITERALLY enough people care elderly try force CNA’s. got bunch yasuhiro hagakures ""The nurse standing ghost!"" 1. watching cnn? 
2. cares sick messaging? 
3. can’t predict future neither guy. Except it’s 2 years. There’s solid 2 years pre-reqs another two years nursing school, even community college level.

It’s breeze nurse, Chemistry 101 enough weed many nursing premed hopefuls, watch crash burn undergrad went engineering degree.

And I’m saying underpaid, even nurses make good money, putting work money dealing heavy situations working long hours. I’ve wondering thing. “semblance normality” mean meet vaccinated friends maybe go sit restaurant still wear mask public, mean everything open like 2019? could handle former indefinitely, thing (and suspect many others) miss pre-pandemic life ability socialize freely people matter me, I’d gladly take exchange mask distance avoid large events now. Hey, least I'm citing source. working paper put respected well-known researchers using census doctors earnings tax returns. argument data fabricated? discussion, think want to, look like even silly dick already chain. Finally good one! think time April comes around cases, hospitalizations deaths lowest since pandemic began. I'm hoping less 20,000 cases, less 10,000 hospitalized less 500 deaths (because lag), could definitely better that. that's case, new spike limited cases, since we'll large number vulnerable people vaccinated. we'd see rise cases corresponding rises hospitalizations deaths would smaller expected. live world convince psychopaths woman alive indeed alive saw faint TV crazy conspiracy theory tells must dead

And wildesr part, pass point return, believing literally anything, never come back. could literally put front them, call paid actress  stuff around March April, days pick groceries person wash hands use hand sanitizer. There's need sanitize groceries. Surface transmission COVID super rare. contagious, air, surfaces. Well yes, would definitely think so. guess point failed mention need remain calm wait real solid data variants mentioned ominously media recently. fact J&amp;J really great data going potential become even better await complete data set near future. True Careful there. significant antivax streak subs. Nice  Yea thought honestly, guess put title article. GUZZOLENE  really hope so. However, today read scientists believe another 6-14 weeks US able see new variants lead increase cases. brings us middle May. Ugh. seem aggressive Oh Happy Birthday hope wonderful day 🎂 could see happening Pfizer gets full approval April. January death toll ended 98k.  Looks like you’ll top list then. Seems like almost free society could manage ""true"" lockdown, though. abandoned concept human rights, allowed complete total invasion privacy started sealing people inside homes like China did, things might gone differently, I'm personally glad that. Yep remember warned several weeks ago. right, got one day NYT care 65. journalists STILL getting wrong?

We amble studies data asymptomatic spread extremely low. KNOW now. 

But still get articles like make seem like asymptomatic people causing silent spread. main concern get hospitalizations down. elderly much immunocompromised population vaccinated open things regardless probably face mask wearing social distancing much adult population vaccinated. Plus remember 18 population still approved vaccine population numbered 74-75 million. become RN 2 years community college. 60-70 credits lot hard.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Based already knew would put good odds vaccine significantly reducing risk transmission, know moved needle much. would absolutely delighted hear them, many people everywhere unwilling comply even basic social distancing mask restrictions.

obviously care livelihoods mental health, ""let rip"" option table. i'm willing guess obvious though. That’s really handle current manufacturing deliveries. grow time wish option! think gonna last long western world either, least massive problem. still, AZ vaccine great. Title makes seem like Israel developed vaccine. know ?

They know all. absolutely track record form lockdown human history. threw pandemic planning fit hysteria chased unproven, untested thing called ""lockdown"" revisited priors since.

We truly lab rats partaking massive experiment without consent. That’s twice big last week’s Monday drop, fewer cases left drop percentage it’s even more.

The drop accelerating It’s like plague inside plague posted LockDown Skeptics called pandemic CASEDEMIC. call people support lockdowns restrictions pro-restrictions it’s derogatory term. opinion means little, believe might referring government take 1 month people start going parties say it’s ok party again. pretty typical bureaucracy not. good bet died due lack oxygen brain. Basically article talking things us aren’t d*omers talking sub now.

All five vaccines eliminated deaths virtually eliminated hospitalizations, comparatively made disease less deadly flu numbers.

In short, d*omers wrong end pandemic sight. Thanks sharing this. Truly good news, though deaths high af. think people (maybe left center) tired hearing fake news flu. think 'right' sliding far right. curiosity, know judge effectiveness? Like known people already getting covid 0 symptoms, know someone symptoms vaccine symptoms first place? 

On hand get rabies something, can't 'not symptoms', seems easier measure effectiveness. wondering process works, especially strange virus people varying affects like flu kills 450,000 people Usa year, least measures avoid spreading absolutely selfish expect people give everything makes human (social contact, purpose life, etc) indefinite amount time. Calling people selfish wanting human contact 10 months non-stop goalpost shifting is... well... selfish. Expecting people give everything people scared selfish. want work elderly mandatory. demolishing elderly. get another job want get vaccinated. There's way get data SA variant. Pfizer, high priority show T-cell immunity vaccine variants? Facts? Yet cite page?

Laughable.

Again, total inputs, total outputs get net $32/hr lifetime. teacher.

No pension, decade lost wages, longer hours, higher taxes, debt, comes together. Canada maybe US does. OSHA DIDLEY Trump office. biden in.... oh look! Shiney new worker safety recommendations! Dang. Didn’t work like hoped :/ 

Lol There’s literally nothing can’t job can’t home. I’m work facing opening office soon traffic. one hardest hit states Tbh isn’t happening new administration suddenly took over. Vaccines wouldn’t come faster think based efficiency. we’ve reached large percent population vaccinated cases/deaths/hospitilization dropping low levels lift restrictions onto reinstate see drastic increases. suspect happen people dooming CNN headlines finding something upset about. Ironically freaking latest thing Fauci osterholm says much different people freaking every article covid doom gloom. Governors lift restrictions confident hospitals won’t crushed. vaccines effective think they’ll zero incentive politically personally governors keep indefinite restrictions. They’re politically popular they’re killing state budgets. reason states like NJ didn’t close indoor dining massive case spikes that’s restriction fatigue real. That’s know it’s politically unpopular. We’re still working healthcare workers (rightly so), hopefully it’s far future. missed much school year. missed seeing kids class getting know personalities, missed lectures favorite topics like Boston Massacre buildup Civil War seeing faces they’re actually interested history. I’ve missed football games, yes even annoyingly loud pep rallies. miss want back without fear anxiety...it’s incredibly tough year grown man times left verge tears days. There’s hope better future though! Many experts demanded common sense things like paying people stay home rebuffed variety political reasons.

Paying people stay home might okay strictly financial sense humans social creatures need contact others. we've done past 11 months barbaric inhumane. Getting checks government change all. doc like porn sub. Pfizer says they'll 200 million doses (enough 100 million people) end May.

Moderna says they'll 200 million doses (enough 100 million people) end June.

Biden announced last week buying enough cover another 100 million people Pfizer Moderna delivery ""this summer"". One could interpt late September. 

But still leaves us with: 200 million people end June another 100 million coming months that. see reason people can't one vaccines prefer it. studies mentioned small done children vaccines. probably good general advice, avoid getting vaccinated bc use antiinflammatories. Talk doctor pharmacist think best you. think realistic expect people wear masks, socially distance, limit capacities, skip concerts conventions, kill businesses tiny number people country choosing forego medical treatment.

Your local health department isn’t going draw distinction people “deserve” die Covid don’t. they’re ones power implement restrictions. 

If shit’s still control area next fall, aren’t going throw hands say “I told so”. think thats part tactic absurdity. puts opponent *always guard* state. everything always goin go smoothly %100 time. Even 99 percent success rate, point 1%. stupid schoolyard bully tactics. Finally good use government help end pandemic Covid Tracking Update: hospitalizations. 7 day average cases 2,000. huge chasm cases nursing homes everything returning normal. Yes it’s trick keep economy bleeding money. government people charge decisions like money. /s Please don’t jinx think truth lot young people die flip side people spreading people much higher risk. sound insane NY times finally starting change tune love ""First, individuals aren’t showing symptoms transmit virus. Infectious-disease experts worry silent spread say reason pandemic hard contain. visibly sick people pass virus, data cited Centers Disease Control Prevention estimate 40% 45% infected never develop symptoms all. new viral variants transmit readily, potential silent spread even higher, infectious-disease experts said.

Airborne particles ferrying virus “really distribute place.”  kept covid news since December reading brought tears eyes. fucking love science!!    right one. eligible population right around 250 million. least one commentator, Scott Gottlieb, believes 120 million upper limit want it. view short sighted. let virus keep circulating eventually completely evade vaccines.   Afaik think trials done representative population I'm sure many people pre-existing conditions. definitely people diabetes diabetes Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna trials reported major side effects (read T1Ds experience Moderna COVID-19 vaccine  ""We're worried,"" said Francis Collins, director National Institutes Health.

I hope gets better you. Stay strong setting boundaries.  yeah really huge fear needles. practical standpoint (like get vaccine without passing etc), scared subconsciously find ways justify taking vaccine. 

nowadays less fear needles couple years allergy injection one doctors even prescribed bimonthly injectable (which still... fun lol), got first flu vaccine back college free nasal spray available asked, point felt like excuse it.

What strawmanning? going pretty. Astrazeneca's already lackluster data ability variant partially evade current vaccines I'd expect efficacy 50%. imagine we'll get another one goalpost moving headlines like, ""vaccine 80% effective preventing hospitalizations"" since efficacy symptoms poor. bubonic plague came went waves every often 400 years. addition, unimaginably far deadly Covid - frequently quoted number 33% European population mid-14th century killed. 

I'm saying indefinite governments worldwide seem firm endpoints lockdowns, restrictions, mask mandates. Nothing like vaccination percentages, deaths, hospitalizations. not. That's misinformation. ban medicines already sold UK market (i.e. pharmacies, hospitals, etc).

Manufacturers completely free produce medicines sell continue export medicines restricted medicines list manufactured intended markets abroad. restrictions typically 15 minute observation period vaccine administered.

Gimme break.

Understandable? Yes. 
Generous? &lt;hollow 0 chance severely ill. trials showed everybody vaccinated immune severe disease. fine hug them. Also ignore ""Great Reset"" shit comments coronaviruscirclejerk. Ok, fair enough. 

I completely agree opinion then. Three: Moderna approved couple weeks ago

But yeah despite working healthcare heard similar sentiment colleague - whole Brexit mindset really created silly nationalism. think it’s bit premature call indefinite. bubonic plague lasted 400 years, apparently. Again, cost repeating myself. less 10 countries sucesss 100 success, safely said strategy needs major revision.

If people right, works.....unfortunately, people don’t correctly.  Since people don’t correctly, strategy needs fixed way people naturally what’s needed safe.

It’s simple. list hundred success stories 5 failures, you’d point.  overwhelming evidence says standard response pandemics needs major revisions. handful anecdotes shows sometimes work. mean? Bad news gets clicks. Look front page reddit: built around getting outraged things. badly, yes. well, outbreak stopped 5 weeks. Several places demonstrated how: Taiwan, NZ, Australia, Vietnam. One thing though, shut one case, one hundred. take 5 weeks.

Everyone else like fuck around ""nobody locks one case"" kind bullshit. suffer months months.

Yes, enjoying full economic life Australia couple cities underwent painful lockdown 2 months, go within 5 km radius homes. But, over.

There. right, long. need test negative. Hide wife 😜 used good years ago Trump attacked seems like started become liberal Fox News Considering level care become infamous among nursing homes...  increase supply, means less vial shipped.
More chances waste used within time. Novavax J &amp; J Chinese vaccines options. would think Sputnik requires cold storage. EU begging vaccines, want know somehow sent UK. unreasonable question, AZ really answered it. got first Pfizer vaccine today &amp; wondering. contracted coronavirus yesterday, would infection interfere vaccine, even make sicker? thats said enough 86.6% adults single dose june 1. would fully vaxed. ofc distribution actually people fully vaxxed all. thats current speed, increase j&amp;j and/or vax approved. im optimist current trajectory really isnt bad. pointing politicians consider, ""rich"". stimulus checks either, people quality things like tuition credits either. remember trump used abbot test, perfect better nothing stringent restrictions WV been? care much people care anything anymore. make far jump gun safety make everything else waste.

You might said two weeks make point, everyone wait long guideline vaccination tells acting like fine. anyone ever snuck sneezed you?

I get dirty looks people side street I'm walking without mask on. People completely exaggerated sense risk. seen couple reports people declining vaccination, saying wanted wait Oxford one.

I don’t care efficacy, it’s 50.1% efficacy rate I’ll gladly take it. reason I’m skeptical however, vaccine came company based china sketchy past hasn’t transparent mass. 

As result, would take vaccine possibly unknown risk body, considering 90% time I’m always home never risking anybody else covid? Social media allow see everything. Yeah, similar superbugs developed via using antibiotics...99% die off, survive particular person, successful mutations, become better resisting. person gives bugs person seen them, becomes aggressive resistive. crossing fingers get vaccination right. like developing countries much choice, reduction better none vaccines gonna thrown used X time, see nothing wrong this.  teacher, really feel like I'm winning. 

Because population work (students IEPs), I've back person since August. absolutely think schools last thing close, lot work people way higher needs done. open schools, can't make parents send kids (which completely understandable). Schools want lose numbers compromise hybrid model. Let say, asked essentially teach kids two different places *exhausting*. Im basically 2 jobs 1 paycheck. regular year, job would involve traveling different schools. Since that's obviously happening now, organization decided teletherapy means completely fill every spare minute schedule. I'm teaching 8 periods day straight through, when, years past I've typically 5. Since work reading intervention, can't exactly teach 1 lesson 8 times, planning takes even time. reason planning period get school 6:30 am; coworkers lucky. 

As said l, I've person since August, getting vaccinated time soon. rational part ""gets"" it, dichotomy esstential enough person pandemic, essential enough get vaccinated said pandemic kind bummer. Meanwhile, I'm seeing teacher friends virtual entire time (albeit states) get vaccinated. 

I mean go rant, I've thinking lot this; I'll stop now. definitely think I'm better grocery store workers (I've seen one thrown around lot). I've never busted ass hard, feel demoralized :/

Seriously hope rest kids' school year goes well!  Also starting go look numbers. It'll probably continue going route  seems likely could picky fall US/UK/Israel/Gulf. Unlikely elsewhere. likely quite bit people covid get tested. There's people beginning got test came out, there's people bad enough case bother get tested. could mean ton people immune least would think would cancel people gotten covid vaccine. mom switched CNN Fox News. ""fox news boomer liberals"" J&amp;J efficacy us 40 70%. job (cheesecake factory) well. 2 hours shot (4 hours max total). really amazing better nothing.   3M N95 masks feel safe enough, given put large groups people first place. love wearing masks probably keep wearing becomes socially unacceptable again. r/NonononoYes I'm sorry. People say Australia back normal normalcy anything approximating life shut moment's notice. Ok good checking. never know days. Perhaps Florida California endless argument better threads. CA lower CFR FL less excess deaths. opinion, terrible job like rest country.  EU’s approach prompted outcry host experts officials said represented dangerous precedent so-called ‘vaccine also viewed attempt bloc find culprit trouble-plagued rollout, lagging well behind Chamber Commerce secretary-general John Denton urged European Commission abandon export regime. Ohh ok, saw earlier day said 3.8k cases. Guess updates multiple times per day.  vaccine, long take immunity take effect?

The trial 10 days showed 95% effectiveness. people saying wait two weeks, evidence shows waiting 10 days plenty good enough. think it'd good gig advertise selling these, take peoples' money, mail poop shut website. districts short-staffed enough subs. school got 2 parents applied work us. many people pushing in-person applied? many school board meetings held via Zoom send staff students back buildings? Catch ""eventually"" takes 5 years. next 3 mutations find could randomly lethal. don’t think morons... well are. think mental toll sending people one way other.

I even understand people don’t want vaccine that’s seen ‘inferior’ ‘botched’, it’s lack scientific confidence education, lot bias. Canada also getting fucked royally supply disruptions. Yes, super immunity weeks. Would faster West competent east asia.   That's reliable asking Trump.  effective preventing virus shedding make safer can't get vaccinated still good

&amp; would good afraid needle. used phobic due bad experiences getting blood drawn repeated due mono kid. Dr would wind needle around much ugh. Got shots allergy treatment excellent nurse clinic, get nervous blood draws. Anyway get fear really hope nasal vax proves successful alone. Moderna asks FDA let sell 10 dose vial price 15 doses.  usual US appropriating shit made countries disproportional rate. developed countries west ***worst*** :( thought pretty easy get 6 doses vial. Denmark generally get 7 per vial 6 doable sure.  bet phrase ""grim milestone"" used frequently 2020 year past. I've mostly seen people getting heavily downvoted asking whether they'll still work

This true. sub long hated people asking questions reason. someone making good faith argument believe vaccines work, far better educate mock call morons.

I really want agree you, believe 'good faith' arguments. many variation ""I want BAD vaccine"", referencing JJ's 66-75% efficiency, ignoring dozens posts (and often article itself) explaining stupid conclusion. would like think due new current administration plan ?? zero evidence stole vaccine it’s extremely toxic accusing frankly really, no.

just disagree someone call names boot kinda makes loser room, person youre disagreeing with. Sure, can't throw statement say ""that's true"".

Also dates wrong, deleted. I've mostly seen people getting heavily downvoted *asking* whether they'll still work called anti-vaxxers. people arguing they're effective, tiny minority commenters taken seriously. people time, energy intelligence seriously research follow new developments. someone making good faith argument believe vaccines work, far better educate mock call morons. actually itd closer 9 months. gonna speed drastically guys want normal summer small comment helps spread glimmer positivity. Thank got Moderna didn’t side effects. goal 1 million vaccinations day. Directing resources defence production act.

I Trump, already hitting 1M/day left office.   That’s efficacy works all. People need learn effectiveness versus efficacy

If J J worked 6 ten times wouldn’t useful easy knock someone down, much harder pull someone hole.

It's really hard pull someone front hole purposefully dug deeper themselves, fight (and reality) entire time, often outright ignoring fact reality. d*oomers do.... mean literally. 

I actually people tell 8 straight days lowered hosplitizations bad sign things come. combat level insanity? us going number one cases soon we're losing. people believe, fuck auto correct think that's true, can't really find numbers say true

Yes, that's burden proof works  Sadly fear best sales tactic.

When younger neighbor's house got robbed. Weeks later, ADT sales people going door door selling fear. Cause yanno, event happened that's statistical anomaly town grew in. Well said.

I’ve thinking thing. around people comfortable one best parts vacation  lowering number cycles PCR test! vaccine. anything else. Dude, absolutely nailed that. 

Do apologize speaking truth.

Fuck people done us. Never forget.  think least wearing mask you’re sick cant/won’t stay home work would GREAT cultural change. winter Covid older coworker netty pot nasal washes bathroom like three weeks... fucking gross. many others got cold too. Yes, Osterholm unmitigated quack. worst front us, category 5 COVID hurricane churning sea.  Nah, idiots (aka ""d*oomers) deserve label. well reddit full morons...

so yes, id agree   healthcare worker getting second shot next week. 

Wondering **WHO FUCK VACCINATED ALREADY ME?? CONSIDERING 1/2 SHOTS “VACCINATED”**  Nobody saying vaccines work.

You seen enough trash sub. Plenty morons argue vaccines work. know states month vaccinations, fall also due getting away holiday period? be, least US, concerned super bowl parties? fuck trying say roughly 50% people know say ""..no flu bronchitis...haven't puking diarrhea, coughing lot"" conflate stomach virus influenza. Look top comment! Trolls everywhere, much time hands. good society mom, healthcare worker, got second dose 10-12 days ago. dad at-risk person home hasn’t vaccinated part don’t anything close contact home anyway. He’s main person pushing wait home. big true...  man several people posted link. Since seems type reddit Google go friend! bit long, read it? There's light end tunnel.

And once, *not* coming Darth Vader's lightsaber. Oxford tech inferior mRNA tech far. complicated manufacture already seen. example Moderna vaccine Europe manufactured chemicals company Switzerland prior experience vaccines. also improbable indication using vector two shots results less efficacy. respect Sputnik V vaccine also better Oxford one.  Well logistically involves people world getting together... definition super spreader. vaccinations unevenly represented different countries.

I one hope would great way celebrate back normal.  valid reasons think antibodies COVID grants less immunity antibodies COVID vaccine? understand people catch COVID twice, people also catch COVID even vaccinated. hard numbers comparing two terms statistics probabilities, rather media anecdotes? Yeah, fear mongering. People seem forget thing continue mutate vaccines effective variants. tweak get booster people protect variants, too. feels tiny me, mostly I’m group won’t eligible least several many months, work exposed hundreds people per day. Idiots acting like masks unnecessary vaccine exists, despite fact none staff visitors aren’t anywhere close getting it.

I hope vaccination ramp faster everywhere since logistics easier J&amp;J AstraZeneca. Novavax probably can’t produce significant amounts, every million helps. philippines. even sniff vaccine here. yea, good luck us  That’s pretty rAdical keep seeing strawmen people calling racist closing borders nations novel virus spreads. come from? Also since care others think? People scream call racist anyways. sounds like cop excuse anything admit virus hoax. Wait, someone profiting selling bad news? I'm shocked, shocked tell you. can't really speak circumstances. parents opposed looking work? Shouldn’t to, get vaccination Imagine generalized blacks criminals, committed crime? generalizing lumping everyone wild getting covid vaxx (for whatever reason) automatically antivaxxer, villanized discriminated against. think people former secret racists act hatred towards small marginalized group (vaxx questioners case) since publically racist illegal.

I mean, I've seen enough commercials ""If injured drug, etc.. call Law Firm.."" 💅🏻💅🏻🤷🏻‍♀️ Germany arent vaccinating more? 
US already vaccinated almost 10% population - 30 milion people. 

Germany hand 2% 

What’s that? transmissible, cases continuously dropping? sloping like crazy, fear variant justified? bet fat fuck stocks vaccine companies said would need 500 million vaccines Ebola Hi, conversation vaccine development able nimbly adjust formulas stay top variants. 

You take critiques society elsewhere. weird people cling unproven bad news like life preserver.

The one people continue spread virus even vaccination, even fully vaccinated, still can't take mask, see friends, travel.

There nothing proven everyone grabs onto like last hope. idea we're going take 95% effective vaccine continue remain locked completely ridiculous, people persist thought, many people take all. would bother? friend group one extent sister recovering cancer respect No. virus occasionally deletes ORF8 protein associated severe symptoms. get one without ORF8, experience milder symptoms/asymptomatic - however, even milder symptoms uses apoptosis (kills cells), pyroptosis, necroptosis ACE2 receptors (epithelial, mostly lungs) viral reproduction purposes. known currently death cells reversible.   Damn, people must hate kids. torture them. case would start J&amp;J's formulation follow Gamaleya's Ad5. Yeah, would make sense. anyone wondering bother using J&amp;J's vaccine way Russian one available, answer doses, people vaccinated doses. simple reasoning. tend somewhat optimistic think permanent decline terms illnesses. Cases may take longer cases among young healthy vaccine yet, vast majority cases result illness.

The US 10% population vaccinated estimates 30% already exposed. numbers higher areas. 50% immunity spread permanently decline. end February another 10% population vaccinated. Unless something goes really wrong vaccination programs see woods within month. We’re also smaller world were. Planes common folk. We’re much interconnected hundred years ago. hands this, per capita would’ve story Uhm I'm sorry, enough vaccine deliveries everyone EU Q3 latest. Huge vaccine deliveries planned Q2.

Not sure would lockdown 2022 delay month two summer reach herd immunity compared countries cause hundreds thousands deaths. didn’t correct though. never claimed happen. understanding implemented make sure wouldn’t happen future. natural completely fair think biggest factor time exposed. Even cashier ring someone covid, they're face maybe 5 minutes max? either wearing mask probably get much exposure.

I know everywhere else I've seen (Quebec) there's lot exposure break rooms etc actual stores. Employees pretty good protecting facing customers hard lunch without taking mask off.  Uttar Pradesh, largest state India, uses ivermectin treat covid19. also used prophylaxis there. also mentioned link. would going work. want able start making money building resume. 

I plans resume normal socialization first half year long I’m living parents. don’t think it’s safe. Ahh shoot I’m sorry, totally missed line.   “I wish knew talking about. don’t” asking everyone else lock another 4-5 months refuse take available vaccines proven effective. Maybe count first dose, thing vaccinated.  Google cases UK, Brazil, South Africa. plateauing dropping. realized I've gone like almost whole week thought heard Trump once.

I've thought Biden like 2 times. That's be. two full dose regiment. higher figures include unfortunate 1,5 doses. UK authorities stated 90% efficacy hold miscalculation attributable something else. mean approved 62% efficacy regiment reason.

The 62% efficacy PCR measured, efficacy measured symptoms higher, much? know. 

Then 1/2 prime dose + full dose booster showed better results lower number stats. soooo confused. would use vector doses. using chimpanzee adenovirus proves aware fact immunity vectors issue... use vector second time around...

I think unexpected result. Probably think chimp virus raise high response real world. check Phase 1/2 anybody guess. Nobody’s calling god, that’s perception shows badly Fauci hurt you.  credentials understanding ""science""? Watching YouTube?

'Science' broad term. Political science science. I've seen examples qualified scientists spoke covid vaxx censored, go take seat there...👉🏻🪑 Wonder also combine J&amp;J Sputnik?

Both use vector.  NYC looks like 20,000 vaccines per day. sure talking about. Theory =/= evidence.

Accusation =/= evidence.

As see again, people believe theory accusation function evidence.

They can't. Evidence data, accusation theorising. personally bother me, find funny Hurry trucks loaders, there's massive salt mine right V name ""vaccine"" though. Let's call anti-vaccine, rather pro-pandemic. anti-vaccine pro pandemic death suffering comes  major thing would’ve prevented year-long lockdown would’ve mass testing. last administration failed that. Test people randomly. Even didn’t symptoms. Test large numbers contact contact confirmed cases. South Korea confirmed cases around time did. Look happened. They’re near level are. But, people also quickly started wearing masks kept distances other, that’s part culture (which pretty damn smart).

We needed steps ahead virus. Waiting till someone confirmed going would’ve neglectful, much Need increase production that. AstraZeneca consider producing instead 70% effective Oxford vaccine. even much change since similar adenovirus vaccines. CDC estimates IFR (infection fatality rate) age 20-49 You’re right. 

I really accepted it’s better let weak old culled nature could avoid wearing paper face grocery store standing back bit people science catches up. 

We’re rugged individuals live nature, chopping wood hunting deer every day. It’s like live highly unnatural technological culture innovate way problems. 

Oh.. except did. Pfizer Moderna vaccines incredible, already saving lives. Well live south I'll surprised get shots end summer correct I’m wrong but: didn’t implement guarantee vaccines promised EU wouldn’t unfairly sold states?

I correct you: Never happened. EU presented evidence happened. single dose case don’t see would affect Japan unless planing “stealing” EU supply

Adding bureaucracy creates delays people die result CNN co. done WSB calling domestic terrorists reason hype went little bit plus T****’s (I autobot doesn’t auto-take comment) impeachment news quiet. That’s reverted back fearmongering COVID news order get clicks revenue. Keystone pipeline joke. worst oil sludge world, ruining environment. get shipped another country. . Even ranchers fighting putting property years. Look canada oil sands look crap environment. Horrible Nice! Happy see common sense throwing incredible opportunity away ""evil Russia muh duh"". need turn drinking game. time new month holiday promised, chug beer. Hey, lefties like Biden either. Libs Seriously trend see every single day, recommend stop watching. Maybe week would better. Go things lol. Good luck making people pay price politicians' incompetence.

Anyone protesting lockdowns branded radical terrorist media. Redditors spoiled numbers lot realize vaccines 50% effective get approval.

And flu vaccines around number believe. really lots contract obligations, right. increasing production capacities. Production already taking place multiple countries, including South Korea. Serbia approved vaccine ago know Russians gonna establishing production well think announced anything regards US market personally see it

Oh, that's meant. Yeah, agree. Idk US approve, yeah, see happening. fair, like conduct clinical trials regardless, exemplified fact approving AstraZeneca based UK trials, conducting own. Imo, would base vaccination status within household. venturing vaccinated vulnerable are, concern. venturing vaccinated vulnerable not, slightly concern opportunities spread post-vaccination reduced (likely greatly so). probably vaccinated polio, measles, chicken pox, mumps, various viruses

That apply here. herd immunity things. (Or mostly anti-vax movement)

If vaccinated, chances getting virus low - could still carrier infect someone vaccinated. practice social distancing achieve herd immunity. hard understand, like all. need ""expert"" like say that.

That's thought saw endless posts screaming anyone bow Fauci accept infallible god. wonder many black folk heard news reports black people skeptical take vaccine Tuskegee tests happened seventy years ago and... hearing became skeptical getting vaccine. heard stories 8-10 times NPR it.  zero confidence grammar source link go city's cite sign certify live work NYC eligible.  Obviously need also qualify current rules well. Unfortunately lost cousin way. Covid lead falling back alcoholism, unfortunately ravaged healing body took us. depends relationship opinion. 

If roommates, think expect people stay home feel unsafe. free disagree thing respecting common places home. 

If couple, think really try get page divert cautious person really can't agree. 

If family, think mindful who's home is. example 28 year old living 65 year old uncle's house uncle risk adverse, 28 year old either move cautious. beautiful, especially since lot countries rely one vaccination. Let’s go 💉💉💉 US definitely desperate enough approve single shot J&amp;J EUA. 

Can always booster later latest variants issue. Well, variants merging next logical step fearmongering individual variants spooky enough. guess they'll say two variants merge create mutant monster resistant vaccines = SUPERCOVID. reminds me, whatever happened twindemic? Flu + COVID going kill us all. saw reporting (media) school still going back full time person/normal next fall, downer. even predict point? Ugh.. doooom. Oof. Idk practical then. 30$? I’d rather leave house get tested free Yes Wouldn’t better stat 30s get it, % die?  Omg found 11 people we’ll see doomposting entire day. Well, we'll never get FULLY vaccinated. always certain percentage protected (either medical reasons anti-vax reasons). idea adequate COVID herd immunity, get ~60% (a number pulling ass), US would need vaccinate 170 million people. Assuming held current 1.35m/day (hopefully speed up) would take 18 weeks reach 60% vaccinated nation-wide.  ignoring pandemic doesn’t work. useful life tips brought Trump administration. Next up, get away insurrection. heck researchers even determine someone got sick surfaces many cases?

If someone goes store gets COVID, would contact tracer categorize mode transmission - surfaces air? would say air, even surface, data would used show transmits air surface. 

And even isolated controlled environments, someone touch something also breathing. someone later comes along catches covid it, tell surface virus lingering air? 

This seems like difficult thing study. anti vaxxers quiet bit what???

Just kidding, know answer sht. saying weeks Fauci. Thanks.  makes zero sense schools closed long been, are. 

This happens things shut panic without ideas plans reopen them, beyond vague, un-quantifiable nonsense like “we’ll reopen it’s ‘safe’”. News flash, isn’t *ever* going “safe” people. So... every country lies ever lied? feels like another strawman avoid acknowledging poorly trump handled everything. Oh let's forget last minute anti lgbtq bits shortly leaving make sure everyone hated him. Oh he's friend ""insert minority group fucked over"" MIL religiously. shake head lol. Whatever makes feel better guess. EPIC sound like US though? Lying government, sketchy people top, general culture anti-intellectualism still smartest scientists? FYI all, article says ""by **end** 2nd quarter.""

Not ""7 manufacturing facilities"" really means anything anyone. Also, Super Bowl parties usually time bringing Grandma Grandpa Great Aunt Gladys. I'm guessing demographics people getting together skew younger holidays. Yes is. first dose provided high levels protection. remember correctly, culturing virus pulled unclean surfaces it’s detected seems proved difficult, points fomite transmission uncommon. Melting pot?? Post /r/worldnews 63% upvote rate hilarious. 1st dose: sore arm 4 days, fever, mild malaise able still work out, game, etc. Onset malaise 24h.

2nd dose: arm became pretty sore 4-6 hours, felt sleepy (out character) evening shot, woke fevers chills 24h endured chills, muscle aches, headache, another 36 hours bit bullet took two Aleve, got feeling normal 4 hrs. took day work good, febrile even without taking Aleve aches gone, headache. bit exhausted brain fog may intermittent challenging sleep. Back normal working clinic day issues. I've heard, vaccines 100% effective preventing infection close 100% effective preventing hospitalization death, even variants. Would true natural infection? got reinfected, almost certain mild case? Interesting. Thanks. probably one rare papers mRNA tech, know literature poorly researched far. mentioned nothing wearing mask. wear mask time issue mask mandates. doubt wear masks internationally thing 2020, would calling ""the worst year ever"". Face it, measures (such lockdowns restrictions, masks said) defined 2020 bad people's brains, disease. Yeah don’t see getting vaccine everyone else regardless race getting going target people experiment them. makes sense  Wow that's insane. went kids would school almost two full years.

You want lost generation children, it. point giving real timeline. got skis said “by Easter” back November.  keep screwing around won’t get elected again. Stick ape brain subs like wsb. Regardless happens vaccines, unless Covid mutates Captain Trips, people going done restrictions shutdowns within months anyways. super-cautious stay home forever want... going people deciding there’s life avoiding one specific virus minuscule chance killing them. kinda sad countries paid least attention pandemic, downplaying ignoring it, get vaccines first, rest world sits waits. Goes show shitty world Disagree take. confer required protection make bleeding stop. downside natural immunity knowledge memory cells 'forget' heard doctor say getting covid surface would like getting pregnant bedsheet. Yep, agree. bizarre, biased. probably say not, come excuse explain away. Funny thing cognitive dissonance, creates problems matter political affiliation. u. personally advocating kids **not** go back school they're vaccinated? age range teach? 16, sorry, vaccine approved kids yet dad either needs learn deal fear get new job. It’s Fauci’s fault, it’s China’s fault get clear head. disgraceful lying country cost us 2 million lives counting. Storage 2-8 °C mRNA vaccines researched

On contrary. CureVac vaccine , likely come around Q3 (currently P3 trial), stable 3 months +5 C stable room temperature 24hrs. also mRNA SOOOOO interested notion. Like, people discussing possibility. confused. could big deal, still, discussion topic disappointing

The HD + SD regime showed (on small dataset mind you) better efficacy SD + SD , potentially indicative immune reaction vector. needs researched sure, least conceptually makes lot sense. Sure too. mean half country everything bad that’s happened last four years trumps fault everything good that’s happened since November Biden’s win it’s worth trying change anyone’s mind you’ve got important things do. Uh, nursing home residents? Right? way people talk people social distancing years come. Humans forgetful also inherently social. Give time back spit-swappin, mouth-breathin bacteria cultures we’ve always wanna know what? No, *am* gonna leave. doubt it’s wealth, it’s pressure end pandemic soon possible. concerns particularly severe COVID cases interfere type interferons, represent one primary antiviral pathways within cells. could impair immune response leave patients vulnerable evidence pretty clear immune response COVID robust vast majority cases. 

Specifically, spike protein encoded mRNA vaccines found wild-type virus (variants excluded). pathways body responds spike protein whether exposed wild-type virus vaccine. leverage humoral cellular arms immune system. antibodies produced vaccine sort ""super affinity"" anything like that.

I think still valid previously infected individuals receive vaccine, deprioritized favor vulnerable individuals infected yet. people respect science thankfully. Fauci well respected, said masks, many people decided wear one. hurt many families lost loved ones someone wear mask following god Fauci. 

The fact care protecting justifying Fauci's mistake deaths humans tells everything need know far dark path gone, radical anti vaxxer. I'm less worried US end (excited for, worried know coming) worried global end. fieldwork developing country (I'm primatologist), far know they've barely secured doses. think US like nearly July-August. fear Africa going roll years.  devil's advocate, cleaning good reason surface transmission rare. Singapore one party state homossexual illegal physical punishment law code.

From human rights perspective, worse shitty backwater asian dictatorships hope work probably won’t. way tried say everything back normal August numbers dropped lasted month course go back strict tells soon they’re going go back old ways  I'm going miss articles absurdly high estimate. actual example November, bad last couple months been, current number 433k. go back find post half Reddit comments along lines ""and that's low side"". Well go talk them
Just opinion doesnt mean care argue it. translate it. clueless. Go ask actuall russian. Nope, intentions, actions, all, leadership, matter. Letting virus rage uncontrolled kill massive numbers people denying severity banking herd immunity infection eventual vaccine *the worst case scenario* also scenario Trump Republican Party committed us wholeheartedly. blame entire result rests squarely fairly them.

Biden unlucky inheriting mess late prevented almost it, lucky timing vaccine. credited taking science seriously, facilitating vaccine rollout best ability. bulk economic fallout, fear, still felt future. Vaccine efficiency? sure that. I'll see find article, read ""shape"" virus targeted, take number coronaviruses (of ""colds"" are) one vaccine. mentioned, great deal cleaning still happen rare none. sure defines ""deep clean"" wipe 100% happen dont trust character. understand post history works like tree scrolling find it? otherwise commenting post far right screen? make sense, please mess people's minds call Michael Moore election prediction model America announces ICE horrible dismantled. 

I hope. Oh definitely. It’ll get better, doesn’t mean it’s going become seamless. credit, none blame? He's got least 3 books COVID-19 already something lose pandemic ending. mean cases coming Europe shutting borders?  Yeah man, definitely realized want since saw family Christmas. good summer. Unemployed, went pool, hiking, jazz. realizing could done more/been less worried sucks, that’s all. Spain willing get EMA approves it. You’re actually deluded. people wear masks Fauci says so? know he’s hurt real bad apologize behalf. I’m not. wouldn’t want make sure nothing gets stolen though? US UK it, whats bad EU it. Japan receive ordered, minimal delay That’s Japan dealing production delays caused fact EU allows vaccines exported. places produce vaccines.... Thanks UK/US me-first policies also effected delays. like EU countries are. That’s Trumpism created. Except vaccine efforts underway long Biden took office. That's straight child abuse. plenty ways kids socialize still mitigating risk. Sputnik good news worldwide supply. Think US covered lol MURDERRR HORNETS!!! AFRICAN KILLER BEES!!! Im sure gone April way that’s actually amazing Nope. It’s numeral. round people send Antarctica? but, need wash every fruit purchase, Amazon packages get delivered 

I would agree big hardships. Yes, chance getting COVID (or something else) surfaces low. since quick easy wash wipe off, there's downside. 

If actual hardship like seeing friends family, risk low make sense. that's case. started back year ago shit borders travelers China contain spread. Right? I'm going wear masks every winter on. First winter life get sick.  Believe me..... we've heard. 

It's really ridiculous fear mongering Tuskegee experiments CLEAR case malicious racial targeting vaccine available everyone. Plus testing phase, case Tuskegee experiments. application. reason would give vaccine black population virus affects black population affects populations. No, really. Biden didn’t come wave magic wand get shots done. I'm partially vaccinated, getting 2nd one weeks. really cool experience vaccine clinic, definitely felt Iike history making. teachers unions demanding in-person teaching kids (vaccine even exist 16 what) parents vaccinated. demands never end, point assume lazy want work. Saying like walking church saying believe Jesus. UK government full propaganda, trust them. It’s almost like manage risks live life 

Tomorrow never promised years earth limited I’m hearing, plan district (and others area) incorporate online learning school year future. relatively minimal, think part plan get students prepared another scenario like happen. Additionally, even pandemic, many districts already offered “virtual academy” students parents interested. could see gain popularity, reality always need person school. Keep mind material taught classes one aspect school experience. Another big part education learning interact peers responsibly developing positive relationships. Finally, school may told “what it” sense periods classes, many teachers, included, like give students bit flexibility it. may assign assignments students give choice work on. I’ll typically allow decide class homework (if don’t finish class). I’ll help guide them, like give autonomy. Sometimes kids waste time find homework, times kids work diligently find don’t homework. history main focus material, always try help students develop skills succeed. learn interact peers/work team, manage time, persevere challenging assignments, consequences actions (or inactions). things hope develop remember, applicable many areas life. knowing history also important, may need know details Tariff 1828 actions Roman Emperors successful. father teacher, personally thinks there’s danger family latter students aren’t vaccinated. definitely approve one-shot something, better get it. hurt me? Talk family members lost loved ones people took advice wearing masks people died it. he's god, like worship god, god justified anything including take lives people. never going ""crush good"". people vaccinated become another mild endemic virus, like ones cause common cold. sounds like trying make sure one powerful men world every single treatment possible make sure take bad turn. walked helicopter live tv looked completely fine. president takes helicopter travel time saying airlifted misleading. Marine One, helicopter always use move president around. hospital day two back debates campaigning week 2 later. almost die. ""Health professionals"" would happy us locked houses businesses shut rest year longer. need get touch reality making recommendations. mean good worked way hindsight, guarantee that, beyond impact perception safety, problem rising anti-vax sentiments (very low UK compared parts EU). parties reasons approach differently. can't say would happened. they’re lot better Oxford/AZ’s. Pfizer Moderna extremely high bars shouldn’t really compare no-one expected vaccines nearly good Pfizer/Moderna’s Or, know, different opinion you? 

I can’t go around feeling sad people 80s die.  Less year ago clearly became actual pandemic, optimistic timelines 12 months good vaccine 18 months production distribution become significant global scale. 11 months later 3+ confirmed great vaccines (up 6 least good enough) vaccination efforts ramping many locations. Barring something catastrophic going wrong, end July (18 months) meaningful portion world population inoculated importantly production distribution fully ramped up.

Are richest nations going get vaccinated first? Yeah, probably. seems likely nations going lagging months behind, early doses at-risk populations enough doses herd immunity. point becomes issue setting local distributions obviously important insurmountable (because, again, rely Pfizer vaccine genuinely hard distribute places).

So close good reasons expect next flu season going that- normal flu season. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Interesting. Given study, really don’t see reason can’t open everything population vaccinated added requirement mask wearing. seems like risks would low. open Fauci church, really dedicated worshipper! Well first nobody wants politicians business owners people. Second want end like US 600K people dead. post manufacturing delays, similar story happened AZ EU broad strokes.

This relevant showing contrast reaction EU US/UK manufacturing delays. One works manufacturers ramp production, lashing everyone anyone trying get vaccines others paid for.

Instead trying sideline observations dislike, going far making personal attacks, perhaps re-examine blindly defending. one forced make passive aggressive empty responses. understand teachers don’t like online learning need realize it’s coming Covid not. Technology always continue grow Covid allowed tech leap even ahead. 

The reality schooling always supposed used prepare next level education. graduated college 3 years ago let tell pre Covid 70%+ course material, homework, lectures, exams online. computer life. let’s forget time management. Thought school trapped building 8 hours told it. doesn’t teach time management watched countless friends fail didn’t ever learn concept time management. 

If teachers truly wanted best students need accept understand important online learning students successful future stop treating like punishment Covid caused. know numbers. would win bluff. wish media would stop pointing 66% effectiveness (as defined much sniffle) point even South Africa deaths hospitalizations vaccine group, since that’s we’re really trying optimize  Sadly virus give fuck anyone saying ignore pandemic. Wait till first vaccines mostly ineffective later year, rapid roll next generation vaccines suddenly good idea.... conservatives like Rick Santorum panel

I rest case. hmm, cant possibly fathom why. Community colleges aren’t going waste spots applicants haven’t taken excelled core sciences. dual enrollment possible unlikely. Wal Mart never even gave $2 bonus... article that? gave bonus like 150 part time 300 full time circumstance equals employee would gotten hours overtime worked beginning pandemic. least Kroger gave temp pay increase. \#BlueAnon finally small trip planned involves air travel! I'm going beginning April going wear N95 whole time airport plane. traveled since February 2020! anyone else trips planned? naivete reddit always astounds me. really think nursing homes afford lose workers nboody wants work already? Let’s remember Osterholm JRE podcast beginning pandemic last year saying Covid would IFR 1.5%.

That enough tell shouldn’t taking anything says seriously.

Honestly, get Covid news r/covid19 daily thread. That’s it.

No one media trusted. hope learned year going forward. go write post thats actually either AZ vaccine, EU UK. There've plenty. post 2 vaccines produced US delivered US nothing either.

Also, maybe anger management little less internet could work wonders? write Mrs. von der Leyen angry letter feel need get chest? Took 3 months Melbourne less cases somehow take 6 weeks USA. Sure. ages define 'younger'? Yeah science. Many scientists time saying airborne transmission last February. don’t need wear masks airborne transmission. know people learn science. don’t lie like last administration multiple times blood half million Americans hands. worship Fauci. worship SCIENTISTS. won’t worship lying racist “businessman” calls president. joke last administration they’re out. see happening. things messaging going on, know messaging effect previously. places messages played virus initial spread, virus spread faster. could find correlations host ratings infection like politics, promise something achieve it?

Right New York, one restrictive states, go eat restaurant, go shopping mall, go hang friend’s house without breaking single rule. parts country (California, NYC) restrictions that, even places still nowhere near restrictions places like UK Germany have.

When suggested multiple masks that???

You hre worship like god, better worshipping many poIitical leaders destroyed countries.  Cope pretty bad already changed world, change world over. Honestly news agencies fear mongering costs? haven’t seen journalistic integrity year. 

It’s fucking terrible brainwashing people can’t see companies really - competing thousands others ad revenue. ex president got almost died pretty much display everyone deadly is. linked section bottom: [Safety efficacy rAd26 rAd5 vector-based heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine: interim analysis randomised controlled phase 3 trial favorite, ""Experts worry that..."" Since expert worrying newsworthy? Utterly crazy That's outright lie. may *as* effective, still going give I'm sure pressure they're create vaccine that's actually effective. metric, care anyone dying? Everyone dies eventually care?

That's logical conclusion line thought.

Telling people still careful even odds they're going get seriously sick die makes sense, especially consider people seem think concerned take precautions they're certain age. Monolingual Yiddish 21st century? Yep. Correlation causation. never participate another lockdown again. Guys, don’t read Vox. It’s Fox left. post posted daily question thread.... There's still media beating drum worst coming, mostly due variants starting circulate. US least, I'm sure worse possible. fairly decent population point level natural immunity vaccinations ramping daily basis. Hospitalizations deaths going continue drop vaccine deployment increases. 

It feels little like scaremongering continue act like something worse went doorstep. people need hear message still hear it, listening already minimize exposure. exactly data. feeds EU bad angle upvoted, title enough many Cool! concerts now? Finally paying vaccine makers exorbitant amounts money take priority every country contact said companies.

Congrats US. Even right still piece shit. Keep mind Indians among youngest people world CFR must low Yep virus go ""pandemic"" ""endemic"".  Go drunk autocorrect, you’re home! used, offering treatment people? saving drugs? Perhaps time loosen restrictions receive treatment. First shot AstraZeneca last Friday 6pm, kicked ass.

Man wish paid attention biology. virus man made, sure knew doing. know virus mutate, one seems several steps ahead. Covid isn’t end humanity lol Damn headline aggressive take. asked EU took longer authorize vaccines answered truthful statements. 

The UK used emergency approval. EU decided too. attack UK statement facts combined defense EU countries started vaccinate little Europe, true,” said, asked UK. “But resorted emergency, 24-hour marketing authorisation commission member states agreed compromise safety efficacy requirements linked authorisation vaccine. Time taken analyse data, which, even minimised, takes three four yes, Europe left later, right decision. remind vaccine injection active biological substance healthy body. talking mass vaccination here, gigantic responsibility.” I've read thing; many hospitals stilling unused. got impression risk severe COVID receive treatment.  I'm assuming means 65 maybe major health issue. large subset population. Nothing new here. Welcome greedy corporate America  want go ahead trust vaccine comes nation openly jails political opposition, throws doctors windows, approves vaccines without trials, go ahead dude. doubt garbage ever gets approved 1st world nation though travel Kazakhstan get Pointless comment Well Lionel Hutz, need put comma ""no"" ""current"" reads ""no current vaccines"" ""No, current Vaccines"" media click machine must fed. Germany thinking buying soon approved relevant European agency. They're already talks producing Germany (sachsen anhalt) Nope. warned NSAIDs ability decease immune response. apparently Tylonel effect. disputing it, corrected believe it. heard Ibuprofen/Aspirin/etc... effect. 

I'm also separately aware NSAIDs/infant advice.  wasn’t lab made man made - Chinas fur farms. mink farms 100,000 animals disease breeding playground. They’ve outbreaks pseudorabies, influenza A, H1N1, distemper, combo influenza distemper created super virus, even mad cow disease feed skinned mink carcasses back mink, brains all. Bats come roost barns poop cages, move farm farm.

Fur farming source. assume it’s nearly hill here?

The current trends look promising front. Assuming never great course trends could change, I'm optimistic. Jesus Christ never expected much Fox News, they've pulling type stuff since Obama years made lose credibility.

People give CNN much shit last 4 years they've turned brand left-leaning TMZ. employ anchors like Lemon literally Hannity. CNN used literally ""The News"" left's version Fox. That's called out. always have.

But talking community college.

“You become RN 2 years community college. 60-70 credits lot hard. There's comparing difficulty becoming doctor nurse. insult doctors say becoming nurse difficult. Nurses make shit ton money.”  pandemic? Perhaps. year two winter mask usage would tolerable.

But trade great use every flu season. lose much humanity without facial expressions. I.. still wipe groceries.

Way back beginning watched stocker wipe nose hand, put shelf. don’t walk away experience highly confident. 😂

EDIT: live big Florida city, way. We’re disgusting. feel like context mattes.. one thing trump right, would emergency authorizing this. Hopefully Biden drop ball hard trump everything else. Work total clusterfuck... I'm 8 days post-2nd vaccine dose today would love something simple like go grocery store, alas, I'm chained desk.

The project I'm working goes live 8 pm Friday night, hopefully things quiet Sunday leave go dinner also-vaccinated parents first time since summer. like avengers fat dudes getting paid sit home shitpost fake news Yeah, athaliah specifically said “Biden’s team”, “Biden”. Uhm... what? mean worst, riiiight?!  Oh get ... funneeeey

Anyway [here Lancet article Great news. Really great. vaccines around world better.

I like Russia - *of course* West sink low accept Russian medicine - mainly poor countries places they're selling vaccine to. Glad see works. science changes everyday.

That wrong! would dead fundamental basic aspects science changed daily. science wearing one mask change? scientists parts world urged masks said needed. 

Sorry god valid people worship poIitical gods etc could wrong wrong. 

You need stop childish worship people based post history leading dark place. misunderstand. I’m saying Russia great perfect country, I’m saying it’s hilarious think America different. two seconds fas. cist nation earlier last month. fragile democracy won’t save you, quit acting like there’s vast divide. agree, find bit odd though - guardian tended relatively pro europe, disspointing see. headline content align think overestimating UK restrictions. Declining deaths awesome. learn chronic damage.
I’m anticipating another bump cases deaths ‘it’s bad crowd’ caught 2020 loose immunity around Spring Break, Easter, early Summer.

In US. Europe fucked. redfield admitted lied medical professionals could squire n95s without public buying pressure agree science changes Exactly. think back couldn’t get tested shortage boom, everyone mother get it. Hopefully it’s way vaccine put end this. even Putin refusing get line it, that’s sign probably ruled legitimate treatment.  located? grandparents (80, 83) got NY. county system older folks signup advance auto filled appointments wait lists go rite aid Walgreens excess/unused doses end day. Perhaps state/county available? don’t think that’s true Florida. 

Our seven day average 177. around 180 August, went (way down—suspiciously down. 53 beginning November!). shot hasn’t really looked back. 

We 4.5 million people 65+ whole lot vaccinated yet. Maybe take longer here. 🤷‍♀️ New cases going deaths follow, deaths started falling yet. 7-day average daily deaths increased past two days. Better end life, think? Even turns erotic sub? people comorbidities? Bill Gates' bots vs Putin bots vs Xi's bots

Beneath bullshit government have, Russians actually extremely intelligent innovative. Private profits make killing students don’t want wait. mask wearing unsustainable entrateiment business. Open rapid testing maybe. Biden potus, everything spun positive light.  Even said nothing could change trajectory lap dog press spun it. might confusing vaccine advice advice give NSAIDs infants general? may leave lot people permanently damaged virus kill. People think death worst small imaginations. Sputnik-V tested United States? even thinking *gasp* using *Russian* vaccine United States? thing one small part country, widespread.

The people bullish HCQ moved bullish ivermectin works great test tube miracle body.

They’ll say attempt big pharma make money...

Well AZ vaccine sold cost, steroids proved effective cheap, alone disproves big pharmaceutical theory. Yeah he’s given bad advice like scientists have. lying science changes everyday.  vs. airborne 2 textbooks mis-interpreted Well's original diagram proving droplet nuclei generation neglected Wells et al...'s work proving driver colds &amp; flus

Can explain little further? understand correctly, claiming distinction droplet spread airborne (aerosol) spread binary. right? Well, least oposition wont poisened even arrested. 

&amp;#x200B;

Trump out. attempt stay power failed. still confidence US russia. people, corruption exists top. Well duh, science! Probably happen many countries people know anything it! looks case numbers deaths coming third crest (the highest one yet). much population already disease vaccines rise, assume it’s nearly hill here? wouldn’t surprised another small uptick I’m doubting ever rise heights coming now. light end tunnel? Genuinely never thought would see day. nothing him, he's trying best. can't understand people like never admit guy human god give bad advice pattern changing guidance quickly.  Jesus shut up. I'm tired bullshit. We've good job getting vaccines arms large percentage people pretending happening they're worried might reflect positively Trump. Let's live reality One dental hygienist told going get vaccinated affects fertility.  

Morons, 'em. Oh wow, higher placebo group! guess that’s happens mix vodka saline placebo 😜 sure south are, live North Carolina shoveled 7 inches “summer” driveway🤷‍♂️😂 vaccines work well new variants posted disagreed downvoted lol though vaccines immune system too... it’s not, unless you’re new subreddit. 


Just look around comments multiple posts story. figure people hosting attending parties point probably already Covid rip families friends. think fresh group people taking steps avoid infection feeling, ""Let's throw caution wind Super Bowl Party."" Vaccination five six months away everybody wants it, think people waiting going throw virus now. It’s worth pointing Sputnik vaccine similar J&amp;J vaccine (Ad26 vector), booster shot (in Ad5 vector). 

I’m curious see US desperate enough approve one shot J&amp;J they’re going hold results two dose trial. Many scientists time saying airborne transmission last February. don’t need wear masks airborne transmission.

Oh fuck's sake. first corona virus caused respiratory illness. SARS, MERS, corona viruses cause common colds, airborne. I'm supposed believe way making educated guess maybe respiratory illness caused corona virus seems pretty contagious airborne. may data specific virus, data similar viruses. They've studying 10 years (SARS surfaced 2003.) They've certainly got education know that, they?

And know what? time stop using Trump excuse, like much one anyway. Great, better dumpster fire. Pat back. THANK YOU! Literally bigger % people received placebo serious adverse effects LOL  CNN Fox told Russian vaccines literally cancer /s Maybe, really don’t know. dad type 2 thin whole life. Office job, though. explicit exercise, everyday things like mowing lawn, grocery shopping, walks me, etc. 

Whenever look exactly people develop type 2, get sense known risk factors (like weight), isn’t fully understood yet.

I can, personally. Maintain healthy weight, cardio lift weights, eat healthy diet. rest control. Well, least grow two extra heads getting vaccinated. Many dead, apparently dead better imaginary side effects. /s Still early say right now, AZ expected ship 80 million EU short 50 million. really big shortfall.   Governments going make decisions based hospitalization death numbers, cases. Vaccinating elderly vulnerable lower numbers drastically. We're beginning see hospitalization counts.

Once low risk hospitals overwhelmed, going force governments hand. going easier less dense areas, places like Los Angeles county still lot logistical headaches work out. Even using places big staples center still behind goals even vaccinating health care workers alone, we're gonna get soon enough. depends state. ICMR withdrew subsidy. states free, I'm others not. Central government hospitals seems free states  Right... Roman numerals common use Russia... Agreed, purifying fires, high ventilation rates airflow directions toward hood would seem reduce amount virus exchange. good argument! mean figures vaccinating 1% population per day speak themselves. There's point propaganda case. EU desperately trying undermine UK distract vaccine shortage, hand...    haven’t even come close NY since initial surge last year. still need mine I'm teacher health care worker. need surgery would like travel it. I'm also immune compromised. resources me? Reminder they're ACTUALLY delivering vaccine faster, made change paper says vials 6 doses instead 5 allows claim 20% increase doses produced day. However every location even ability extract extract dose reality actually get less doses paid for. mean really whole thing rooted Covid really well grabbing ACE2 receptors lungs. crux everything seems. B117 variant? Yes.

The B117 variant E484K mutation? No. Maryland Fucking A, USA!

I've watched abject horror dismay (as many you, I'm sure) America--fucking AMERICA--sat hands global pandemic brushed seriousness it. Twenty million doses unaccounted for, opportunity purchase hundred million doses Moderna vaccine squandered, absolutely plan distribution, creating chaos frustration state level. 

Now look us. 

Crank fucking engine, bois gurls! share list endemic viruses eradicated? flew 4 times holidays used cloth mask fine, entire family. family aviation worked whole time without issue. local subs general like that. FB groups.

My local FB group loses minds whenever see kids outdoors maskless.

shit like *what kind parents would let kids wander around pandemic.* personal favorite, *These kids selfish! would never acted like age.*

Do people remember teen?  lmao here, okay holidays eating drinking decorating nice distraction. cold reality January hit I'm mourning year life I've lost. makes harder seeing people age traveling, going vacations, brunch. Meanwhile seen parents year. Research children: 

Pfizer fully enrolled COVID-19 vaccine trial kids ages 12 15, focus 2,259 participants assess safety efficacy group. clear would produce data time soon.

Moderna running trial data kids 12 up, recruitment difficulties.

AstraZeneca plans continue U.K. trials new protocol kids ages 5 18 ""beginning coming months”.

Johnson &amp; Johnson talks regulators including pediatric populations development plan.

In short, doubtful efficacy data children time soon. cases drop, number infections trials also drop, take long time evidence efficacy produced. think likely vaccines approved children risk factors (i.e. immunocompromised) case-by-case basis, like pregnant women right now, would surprised never get blanket approval younger kids. stop people complaining Trump ventilators, PPE, .... production.

USA lost quite bit manufacturing capability, pandemic revitalize Medical manufacturing forcing federal, state hospital groups buy made America products. read article?

They said wear masks distance June over.

What pessimistic that? Nobody waiting get vaccinated. get text, go. local pharmacist spoke saying they're unable provide vaccine anyone proof US residency outlined CDC guidelines. I'm sure must published online somewhere, I'm difficulty finding it. someone please assist? havent even heard news vaccine state, maybe I'm looking wrong places youd think word would gotten around how/where get one.

Perhaps high populous cities first, idk. Yeah really surprise, month half distributing vaccines already 1 million doses day. Give another month see hit 2 3 million per day assuming supply. everyone debating letter v number 5, V Vendetta So? suggesting we’ve enough good news it’s time pack up? way, want good news get. know multiple decades 1918 flu pandemic ending flu vaccine invented, right? 10,005 really makes sense Poland high levels Pfizer vaccine available short term. Otherwise vaccinating young significantly higher rates vulnerable. title bit theoretical article seems sound? continue wear mask distance June over.  trust anything Russia. probably worse relative summer can't see anyone would think worse even comparable fall/winter. Good job, need every vaccine defeat this. production scale 10x-100x.  Correct virus’s never mutate.. unless get food.  relevant. Nope Ehhh jury still one personally know somebody caught twice, 7 months apart. EMA MHRA say effective 65s. Unless data proves otherwise perhaps keep nonsense yourself. Great. Combine MoCo's god awful vaccine rollout end well us. Right, they're rush specifically precarious economy is. West largely able borrow ton money keep lights on, cost paying back, manage it. Russia kind halfway economic ruin good day, keep big boys resolve pandemic fast enough. That’s correct, comment already long, trying keep simple could, general method vaccines use, exposing template still gives immune system exposure virus like. drank 3 glasses wine last 6 months. Turns drink polite, otherwise desire stuff all. Weed though hand ... hospitalizations depending state, central government hospitals It’s lack education ffs. It’s desire best chance catching covid. still think people take J&amp;J don’t shame people wanting best vaccine especially time many people eligible nearly enough mRNA vaccines every person country. Things going well....we're worst economic downturn since great depression people can't work... like pandemic like 3-6 years ago. wait century. probably going cause decent slowdowns US, too, J&amp;J still getting Baltimore plant running (currently made mostly Netherlands). much production placed EU concerning. 

The US concern, still is, current administration much friendlier Canada interest seeing Canada vaccinated quicker, Canada definitely needs domestic production ensure supply. ut would imply UK pass criteria

Why? UK adequate ethics boards monitoring/auditing capabilities?

Has FDA announced indicated would approve AZ's vaccine solely done UK? understand want Russian Chinese vaccines ""fail"".

IDGAF vaccine comes point, least proven safe effective. arms get vaccines better. Yes um it’s detected everywhere... mistake. happened small handful cities? find hard believe. really. Many Pfizer.  Good see getting new job though, rather going dole, even overcommitted bit. spent past weekend crying nonstop, feeling sick non-life version life we've living long now. desperate progression again. really hope around corner. 🚀🚀🚀  seen anecdotes hard study takes time. enough different ones assume something going on. Exactly find years long science need figure out. brilliant news! Go Canada!!  Sweden’s ICU deaths lower result admitting people, even doctor evaluate them, article can’t claim lower ICU deaths positive. 

I know claims elderly people denied treatment Sweden. That’s don’t believe numbers represent true situation. Agreed. 

While won’t see vaccines while, it’s nevertheless positive move. Canada (hopefully) learned can’t rely even closest allies need vaccine manufacturing in-country. I’m expert gather, mRNA vaccines don’t weakened version virus, template protein similar COVID-19’s. Going rate EU country compliment right now. True, Make News Boring Again. FDA authorisation applies extremely tightly defined product. There’s world stuff goes - vial dimensions, exact type glass, labelling materials, fill ratios, name it. Moderna wanting stuff product bottles probably fine FDA higher change standard posting vague assurances internet post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 🤘🤘🤘 much comment here. There's background? Reasoning? rest potential vaccination plan? ""tweet"" can't even called article. purchase enough. Even without Astrazeneca Novavax we'll enough J&amp;J looks like approved. 200 million doses Biden talked buying likely either never actually bought else donated third world. We're already scheduled everyone 18 vaccinated would receive single one doses. Astrazeneca and/or Novavax approved speed process. Sorry facts support political rhetoric. That's (Joe) spells name.  remember woods statistical. Young people still get COVID die it. start getting back normal, caution still worth way knowing sure one death long-hauler (what latter means/is still clear) lol, people still exist ""8% efficacy"" embarrassment? Jesus. think people can’t read form coherent response times. also take account everyone has/had get time population examined working-age Californians. title news story that's misleading.

A accurate way less buzzy headline might been: 'Among Working-Age Californians, Food Agriculture Workers Highest Risk Dying COVID-19.' flu generally cause potentially life-long heart problems 6+ months symptoms recovery, though. I'm fine flu vaccine lower efficacy (I get flu vaccine every year), I'm fine COVID vaccine lower efficacy could still potentially allow mildly symptomatic infection followed months lingering symptoms. Ah well pleased know Oxford/AZ say UK approach leaving 3-12 weeks fine. write ""instructions"", stop spreading idiocy UK giving 2nd doses (which are). don’t order UK? Oh right, UK doesn’t export all. delays due production issues, selfishness. Hmm, rate vaccine distribution Germany. Doesn’t sound nice imo 

Plus, Russians like use English place Russian variant gathered. run across lot instances walking around Moscow. It’s curious english speaker like myself, I’ve told catches eyes ears Russians maybe considered bit higher class? Read article. referring professions. Specifically professions deemed essential. No, they’re seriously saying exposing non-deadly viruses. immune system needs practice function properly. less exposed environment, unprepared immune system face it.

The COVID virus killing way many people safe expose wild. That’s need expose weakened version virus bodies vaccines. allows immune system get feel virus work create respective antibodies could fight stronger Absence evidence claim giving vaccines benefit doubt. statistically significant data single case suggesting.

I'll take first vaccine available me. Michigan, pretty populated county too. We've looked. We'll continue look. mom moved years ago, two kids. primary reason we've super careful isolated. vaccinated, relax bit. Although put guard everyone else able get vaccinated. Unfortunately come much later ""general healthy"" categroy. I’m expecting 20-50 year olds probably gonna get J&amp;J, Moderna Pfizer likely gonna reserved vulnerable people healthcare workers much higher risk severe illness death. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Oh, took moment. Well played. It’s easier say don’t know either you’re willing give virus benefit doubt. Cool. 

As long you’re personally okay taking low efficacy vaccine leaving Pfizer Moderna ones rest us, we’re okay. 🤷‍♀️ Technological advancements wouldn’t helped first steps precautions weren’t there. Medical attention last resort. Especially there’s 0 capacity. would’ve hit 0 capacity much sooner much longer. hospital beds mean hospital beds. Confirmed Covid needed hospitalization wouldn’t stood chance. emergencies wouldn’t answered, therefore increasing excess deaths. Again, precautions saved lot lives even half ass it.  looked found list: smallpox. going eradicate COVID-19. able eradicate last pandemic friend (H1N1), despite 60 years vaccinations. can't get entire world hard -- welded homes -- lockdown. going able vaccinate kids another year. ""couple months"" even couple years. They've working since March.  Working distribution months exactly rocket science. Canada joined chat.

We got shit coming province site vaccinate 10 thousands people per day.  CureVac results expected?  Ok, Florida.




Edit: clear, I'm talking Florida open since summer, yet Florida followed trends. Actually Florida done well considering high number older people lack real restrictions. talking microchips truth serum. Haha Hard approve requested yet filtered ventilation recirculating virus aerosols air?

even hood vents outside suck virus laden air past face. aerosol scientists suggest people riding car someone outside household sit one front, one back &amp; opposite sides vehicle. open window **opposite** rider suck virus *away*. love sub see plethora good news something like quickly bring back earth lol seem think I'm arguing bad response. not. 

It still reach per-capita deaths Spanish Flu. Again, huge part medical advances, per capita numbers are. Another Washingtonian chiming in, unpleasant watch/participate in. 

We mass vaccine site locally anyone hop queue set appointment. site got 4,000 vaccines week healthcare/over 65's, 1,500 doses sent back doctors offices previous week's vaccines ""borrowed"" from. 

The reservations remaining 2,500 doses opened 5:00 p.m. last night 6,000 people line second countdown started. COVID number one cause death US, exceeding heart disease cancer. easily transmissible respiratory droplets.

I think that's end discussion

Edit: COVID almost exceeds death heart disease cancer combined US. LOL. Actually lol. said another post thread, they're cut-off mainstream society. Reeeeaaaallllly cut-off. Imagine Amish, except live city. F Meanwhile, I'm confused this. country mRNA vaccines. France Germany saying work? I'm scared parents People want lockdowns continue want work. would thought. two-shot trial 2 month separation doses, might know second shot worth getting people get second shot anyway. would rather whole mess suddenly end tomorrow amount money, even billions. I've vaccinated, parents vaccinated... $500k might say ""fuck everyone else."" hate simply cannot energy country... Even new administration place, sour taste mouth yet leave.

We're celebrating finally vaccinated higher number infected - that's something depressing celebrate.  500 million ebola vaccines heard already using mRNA method Georgetown university gene therapy ...? many years instead chemotherapy cancer patients also approve back August results we're published. create doubt mean humans never encountered Ad26 till first time? (But neutralize it)

This 😂😂😂 made laugh hahahah thank youuu. probably express well. Sorry Sort of, big problem flu multiple strains re-combine inside (usually animal) hosts every year - 2 antigenic proteins interest, hemagglutinin (H) neuraminidase (N) relevant, year dominant variety might combination. That's hear flu strains called ""H1N1"" ""H5N3"" etc. 

It takes year make enough flu vaccine upcoming flu season. epidemiologists take best guess dominant problematic strains next season, design vaccine accordingly. years guess better others, vaccine thus effective. going indoor places close contact others, sure hell is. understand point Yet we’re still number deaths we’re 100 years medical progress. basics there, half-assed it. fully-assed it, think would’ve even technological advancement have. Rest peace hero. really link us comment writer 1947 trying claim premonition? link Milton Freidman quotes would like says essentially exact opposite... actually education pedigree lived century. One country point say leader took government, eliminated free elections poisoned opposition leader gaining momentum, country nut job try steal election, fail spectacular fashion since faded oblivion. George orwell right one countries, hilariously wrong other. () silent Even though 100, hurts. Rest Peace, absolute gem man. People becoming unironic anti-vaxxers rather accept Russians make effective vaccine. said implicitly dumbass lol. ""Not lying science changes everyday."" right upper arm! Almost like know now... hopefully symptoms mild non existent due vaccines. Whether using doses per vial actually ramping production fantastic news. Also side Atlantic Pfizer fantastic job even exceed promised doses. year end least one billion received immunity ground breaking vaccine. solution vaccination 100% effective vaccine (which probably impossible)? 62% vaccine means infected 62% time. understanding J&amp;J trial one died hospitalized. key. 62% time get 38% time mild cold, inject veins right I'll go life. 

Plus said above, 1 shot. Moderna Pfizer 50% one shot. come booster, maybe even better. knows. isn’t even relevant benchmark. typical U.S. flu season kills five 15 every 75,000 adults hospitalizes 100 them. assume would agree vaccine transforms Covid something much milder typical flu deserves called effective. scientific definition. read Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine 66 percent effective Novavax vaccine 89 percent effective, numbers referring prevention illness. count mild symptoms failure.

A lot people miss this, pretty important.  Remember..you sick. got this! Almost there!! COVID recovered? opinion means anyone rolled dice? Many would died, economy would much worse off. ""dragging pandemic"" allowed time vaccines released, seeing now. 

Frankly, shocked getting upvotes. nearing end plan worked. first two lockdowns, I've stopped though. helped cope first realised productivity (yes still productive home) anxiety creeping. US better freedom press freedom thought. pretty safely say, even Trump, academics muzzled words filtered state apparatus. can't say Russia. phase 3 results analyzed independent body? mean I'm pleasantly surprised given tried roll early last year, I'm happy turned safe effective, everyone get hands Pfizer moderna vaccine good news vaccine ""the guys"" indeed works. wonderful Canada, therefore, world! figure also spread across age ranges. believe effective younger patients older patients. gives scope possible stratifying receives vaccines...The EU already hinted bit. put anything past them.

ICE is, theory, necessary evil. practice, seem lean towards latter. Hang there! It’s half-assed lockdowns problem. Realistically, places never going Vietnam, NZ, etc able achieve. 

But...if took hit via deaths overloaded hospitals, definitely would affected economy. delayed. reason literally millions people around world meet especially countries besides US barely started vaccinating. God bless, God bless... Yeah? course blame them. Pessimism choice. I'm pointing stupid people, everyone lumps ""antivaxxers"" (whatever means, guess anyone concern fear)  one group, seemingly comprised nutjobs. We're global pandemic one delaying vaccine. moment offered one go. sooner get vaccinated sooner pandemic ends might make sense focus tangible failures action vs theoretical lower death doll. One show video audio imagine. 

This way people actually lost people know remember leader voted handled crisis vs conversation ifs maybes. Herd immunity via vaccines much, much, much, much different herd immunity via ""everyone run get infected, time COVID parties"" incompetent leader refuses sign initiatives provide guidance, make effort less effective. 

Quit talking shit. simple concept. Almost like need evaluate nature extent lies instead saying ""everyone lies"" setting lies equal other. actually V Vladimir, DUH 🙄 

CDC says no. live virus vaccine physically impossible infected virus vaccine. cases would people caught someone else real virus would personally prefer getting sick training immune system never getting sick. that's I'm surprised see collaboration good thing, considered positive development

I never said 😅. said dishonest present collaboration benefited parties *equally*. way salvaging AZ's low efficacy. glad working vector yield, I'll post source little, non english one hand. 

Okay. really wanna see saying talking 62% number two doses AZ that's accurate comparison. right compare another vaccine lower efficacy bound regimen that's used 

But absolutely fair, that's data impression regiment that's approved, definitely EU, believe UK well. absolutely cannot understand refusal accept efficacy comparison game vaccine nationalism cheerleading

I'm either. said like fact AZ's muuuuch lower efficacy ignored comparing vaccines, slightly lower efficacy vaccines gets negative coverage. claims, true, apply certain regions worst part first wave.

But yeah, overall ICU death rate say much severity linked age is. comparisons within certain age groups, taking age differences account way. Even guidelines ICU admission median age differs different populations. [It's 83% Atta boy President Biden ! Keep fantastic results sad news, rip Sir Tom. 

Amazing inspiration raising money NHS. That’s interesting case make. pairs really well discussion post class year ago. vaccines came essentially part question “what group vaccinate first why?”. first would think elderly medical workers...but quickest way may vaccinate super spreaders people 18-30 range likely spread it. agree giving healthcare workers elderly first, it’s interesting counterpoint. Adderall works best randomly stops working times.

Omg issue thought kind head. wonder happening? previous administration deep problem admitting anything wrong, ever, reason, latched deep cleaning something could actually do. done that, would admit needed masks get domestic production enough meet domestic needs foreign sources *needed theirs*.

Of course, hurt long run. ""6 feet social distance"" everyone latched onto. There's nothing magical 6 feet, intended something for, say, grocery store lines. still see sit restaurants, churches, etc say ""it's perfectly safe, everyone sitting 6 feet apart"" (even though clearly see aren't), really need like 8-12 feet depending size room often completely replace air room.

We gave people simple common sense suggestions early became gospel even knew whole story. we're trying tell people ""you need distance, need proper masks"", they're getting mad goalposts moving reality authorities never said goalposts, good starting point. Yes, right. Implemented avoid stealing

But stealing look stealing. example, ""delay""... Delay stealing, pretty clear. effect same.

So correct question 

Didn’t implement guarantee vaccine delivery schedule EU wouldn’t sacrificed deliver vaccines states? 2020: year either got corona get sick all. didn’t admit nothing, said lied, me. Watch language blood pressure, don’t want rage Reddit comment Dr. Fauci lmao Yeah, family said vaccine 
the drugs taking pneumonia. I'm real shit day made laugh. Appreciate it. went back re-read article reply. see bad news way. new plan US receive 200m doses May, earlier previously accepted. Whether done via extracting doses vial shipping vials matter. anything, getting doses per vial Pfizer ramps production allow begin shipping countries sooner. also great news since we're safe everyone safe disease communicable. US doubt approve J&amp;J single dose. reason to. still efficient vaccine help end pandemic many expensive covid19 far been? imagine due level natural herd immunity inevitable decrease end holiday season. think there's enough vaccinations take effect yet. one private company Brazil talks ""Brazilian CDC"" allowing use Sputnik V Brazil. last time heard it, allowed studies. study, published Lancet, believe *shot* (sorry) making Sputnik V available Brazil. Ah, right. saw getting offered assume must it. point stands. Geez fucking miserable lmao must buy vacuum tubes often Thanks.
""Humans appear able neutralize it."" 

But terrifying? 
Let's say naturally occurring Ad26 enters body. can't neutralize it, growth kill u?
Or misunderstand? mean humans never encountered Ad26 till first time? (But neutralize it) yes, there's small percentage may get positive vaccine, that's doctor said. once, state top good lists, mostly bottom. third highest rate vaccination rollouts state far. personally doses vaccine I'm 65 frontline position. I'm hopeful :) thought get first dose pneumonia? Regardless, sad news. Good news...luckily people life seem pay attention “public discussion” vaccines anyway. We’re patiently waiting turn get whatever vaccine get ahold of. Hoping get mine summer. helps, take long time help work anything happening. can't change course large ship moment. are, still trending specific arguing?

[This I'm talking know mean say works. SUPPOSED work, Russia did. Hence absurd argue concerns virus evidence bias Russia. Chinese vaccines actually seem less effective Sputnik, Pfizer, etc. Plus haven’t even published data yet Dubai bars? TIL. EU threatened stop export vaccines UK ordered last summer? 
No, think send excess vaccines Africa. facebook cancer. without 7 months, don’t miss slightest. severe arthritis, cerebral palsy, neuropathy. need ibuprofen get day... I've never taken CBD wondering might alternative would affect vaccine? Exactly Well explains Reddit deleted lowlife comment then.  Nope sorry doesn’t... know likely nonsense, two claims come from? (I hear covid deniers)

A) virus never isolated (??)

B) PCR tests extremely unreliable even creator PCR test states work

I'm believing them, wondering originated from. Facebook I'm guessing. “Mostly normal” different different people. really doubt means distanced masked like now, fall, especially colleges. Students generally lower risk group, students teachers offered vaccine time.

As far going back normal, things might change. Maybe means won’t stand crowd waiting move dorm; scheduling staggered. Or, may option virtual learning days certain lectures. Maybe you’ll provide negative covid test one time attending. speculating.  No, never wanted FAIL. vaccines better. problem was, Trump office would ever sure really safe giveaway Putin?

While that’s good Florida huge decline hospitalizations, you’ve huge increase deaths. Government saying summer, May. Summer realistic. May unless enormous ramp vaccinations. right vaccine filed registration wont far Vaccines potentially less effective new variants, much problem. zero science saying work current variant.

I'm interested Fauci saying potential higher reinfection variants, even words exaggerated fear mongering now. China named vaccine Great Vaccine. CoronaVac showed ordinarily! 91.7% efficacy 3+ month wait? reading incorrectly? needs professional help, online advice. trouble going getting accept it. average person COVID infects 3 people. means 3.3 million people infected 1% US population. take account 3 people could infected, infecting another 3 people; that’s 10 million people infected 1%. I’m hesitant go diminishing returns due possible exposure sources. yeah. 1% population remarkable correlation infection rates going down. Left handed lives matter!!! Antimask subs kept saying governments keep pushing idea permanent masks/masks distancing vaccination August, MSM even entertained idea. also learned lots negative effects masks lockdowns there. predicted lots things correct. never plan countries actual lockdowns, countries actual leaders last year. vaccination efforts become real pandemic. Actually real pandemic always publics stupidity. certain doubled amount fluoride water back early 2020. amount stupid( especially sub) convinced. common Russians use English words like rest world? TBH never loved - thought big distraction Tory's failures - NHS funded fundraising. That's true tbf, need shit that, fault something honourable. case NHS properly funded deal Tom Moore's money help even more.

But yeah r/uk one miserable, self-righteous cynical places I've ever come across reddit. Stay away sub toxic. first product label make Space ""Made Russia"" it, must know make reliable product oomph it

Russian also invented Helicopters, proof get inventions ground around world good days going 40k see graph around 10k. Yesterday pathetic 5k plateauing. I'm hopeful it'll pick though. I'm shocked getting upvotes too. many people upvoting statement like ""Lockdowns actually dragged pandemic longer""? stopped even consider whether makes sense?

This strikes lot survivorship bias. hundreds thousands people died COVID-19 get speak themselves, point, become collective number easy dismiss daily lives. Little attention given number people saved lockdowns mitigation measures. good news! would hesitate one second offered vaccine. Tell New Zeland, doubt people would half compliant without financial support.

As friends family bit, people deal weeks. 3-6 weeks turns 3-6 months, that's becomes problem. Almost successful lockdown needed last 2.5 months, easing restrictions least. reason, consider Melbourne lockdown good example follow. Reading words ""ending lockdown"" gave different kind hope joy! agree, already 100 wanted go enjoy final trip, let him. need advice mom, believes Covid believes ""slight cold/flu thats super exaggerated "" thinks vaccine cause infertile microchip, aborted baby parts? kill me. walks places without mask sometimes scares me. Yeah. thought exactly. 

Great news theory risk health based small probability state-run, dictatorship-driven, research project fact fabricate data. 

Let dw flow care - trust anything comes types regimes. call personal attacks, call telling truth. Maybe stop playing FIFA read book. matter politicians say though. ema approves vaccines independently. countries get want tell constituents ""yeah approved safe get like Russia"". Even az vaccine treated ""give us many can"" report address REinfections? Like what?

Specifically, anti maskers correct since know sure masks help? anti vaxers, vaccination saved countless lives decades. right along?  thank YOU!!111 I'd rather SICK MISERABLE two weeks EVERY FUCKING YEAR sabotage GOD'S BREATHING SYSTEM. new normal!11! /s Sir Tom Moore. Sorry fairness never claimed everyone would vaccinated Easter, said things would significantly better Easter, doubt things significantly better Easter  necessarily. 2 doses, 100 million Pfizer May, slightly less 1/3rd country. Moderna expects 100 million end March, another 100 million would process end June. So, end June 200 million, slightly less 2/3rds bit shy adult population No, think go ahead conflate. isn’t worth arguing yet are.

(We also don’t want hurt anyone’s feelings get sued potential charter violation.)  Algeria, Argentina, Serbia Russia moment far I'm aware. successful vaccines have, better. 90% sure yes. masks/social distancing existed past summer, governments done shit job power hungry. what? slightly related note, dad reason believes China 100% effective vaccine.

* Assume worst-case scenario using variable above
* Add *likely, unlikely, could, might, maybe* drive headlines
* Hope maybe 2021 finally get Time's person year award
* ?
* Profit!!! Unless want vaccine passports, makes sense force people comply policies relax restrictions vaccine rates hospitalizations reach certain levels.

I'm pretty confident I'm transmitting virus vaccinated person, want give free pass anti-masker falsely claim they've vaccinated overall vaccination rates still low. Results pretty similar I'd say: J&amp;J endpoint 28 days first jab, however antibody production peaked 56 days (8 weeks). optimistic guess two-dose trial result excellent efficacy (looking phase 2 data). second dose administered 8 weeks, take time numbers out. happens, people might offered second booster shot. read correctly 2 doses efficacy 54.9%? real low? Shes trusting ""doctors"" saying vaccine isnt even effective theres point even taking it... covid-vaccines UK currently exporting? 3 EU exporting? Keep whining, nobody side, lmao Side effects?  26th deaths per capita states. right middle everything open. remember people predicting Florida death zone? Evidently happen informative, thank you! Hmm. Vaccinations delivered omelet form? I'll invest! talk seven facilities? don’t see reference all. mention essentially would mean restrictions last forever, vaccines good enough, is?

I know ""Lockdown"" foulest word English language sub, idea shutting places people congregate spread disease actually managed reduce spread said disease terribly shocking novel concept.

Nope. thinks injecting water. trusts dumb ass preacher medical professionals, preacher basically saying things sadly believing all. asked simple question REinfections way anti-science. give topic answer call names? necessary. grateful first day vaccinator yesterday. know someone too. Husband works hospital won’t put older kid back school kid get vaccine. whole year since last March porch visitors outdoor activities. Kid homeschooled virtual everything else. It’s sad. good friend working nursing home still lets hang friends won’t. Assuming US, fall everyone wants vaccine gotten it. colleges still restrictions point see would possibly criteria ending them. Interesting, 5 times giving blood passing nearly passing time nurses told need blood badly sign again. I'm happy get needle stuck me. 

I donated plasma problems, takes hours places take done much. vaccine manufacturers forced conduct trials US well US pleased treated differently.

If want FDA approval, necessity. many ways. terms clinical trials. 


In way? US tested several vaccines population too. 
Manufacturing different clinical trials. curious went since mentioned 'led' way terms clinical trials. Considering one fumbled dose administration Oxford vaccine major protocol deviation, can't really call 'leading' way. Yea, sounds right ahahaha. Hopefully didn’t offend! Still trying understand Russian soul)) made 170K 2020 kid lol. Try again. Aren’t weekends?  best take Novavax production facility come REAL handy Christmas 2022 Well, fact talking COVID. cycle threshold 35 bound find whatever looking for

To clarify PCR test make viral genetic material appear matter many times cycle it. someone infected 4 weeks ago possible ""dead"" viral genetic material trigger positive PCR test even though person actively contagious. 

The cycles likely catch remaining inactive viral genetic material thus good reason test beyond threshold. EA Sports ensure social distancing next decade new NCAA game drop Novavax production facility come REAL handy Christmas 2022. Fully agree bro. Well make six figures, probably ever make, jokes still you. Oh yeah Nets Knicks. Also remember eagles lost purpose giants couldn’t make play offs? Okay I’m lmfaooo don’t wanna hurt like dr Fauci That’s pretty common vaccines. 
Given urgency companies want add 3/4 months gap testing. Emiratis get priority everything can't put price freedom. take $1B tradeoff.

What's money can't spend enjoy it? Please let Americans read this, new crazy theory. general, diseases, vaccines provide better immunity infections, way SARS-CoV-2 too. agree everything except “Anything better nothing”. 6 month old mask keeps getting reused 100x worse nothing. issue mask itself, mask wearing culture. Every single thing mask wearing culture wrong decreases effectiveness masks. That’s find people N95/KN95 way less contagious regards COVID people wear surgical/cloth masks former proper mask wearing. misreading mistyped, saying give US 70% world 90% I'm perfectly fine trusting Johnson Johnson unfamiliar Moscow. governments 

Not randos MSNBC role setting policy know. state 21 million people, that’s pretty impressive. However sub seems hate instinctively politics. Headline Florida Times year COVID-19 pandemic, researchers still sure survivors may regain senses smell taste – ever.

*sigh*

Can abolish media? Lockdown fanatics care. Yay! Ah yes, Putin wants us look way Navalny. cure. first point would lead second, isolate, mask, etc like one would protect pneumonia get physical sure everything else working order. wouldn't. J&amp;J advantageous one shot 100% effective hospitalization death. Presumably Sputnik well, that's two shot. Remember 72% effective symptomatic disease still fucking effective. Poland high levels Pfizer vaccine available short term

It doesn't:

- 10M people older 60 Poland
- Pfizer sends 300k doses (for 150k people) every week Poland guess olympics run decreased capacity. Athletes sports used next spectators anyway :P 0.

Stop lying. first shot already gives level protection.

Nevertheless, Moderna/Pfizer/Novavax much better vaccines overall countries try get many possible combat new variants get quickly. Single dose, don’t know promised delivery numbers. single dose makes game changer.

I admit we’re sucking Covid wise though. 18+ currently

They vaccinate children however MHRA approves Awesome news. Lowering lethality transmissibility would amazing. far know, first set clinical data we've seen shows vaccines lower transmissibility. Believe research concluded yet, strong expectation transmission reduced Weird. CBC says going make significant impact current vaccination effort. bet AP style rule--you mention someone first last name mentioning last name. Cringe. better vaccines later reach developed world. yes AZ cheaper, makes sense countries go better vaccines get quicker. AZ simply effective enough Yes, ""birth rates"" way phrase that. birthed? Well, one knows. Sputnik? Really? Trying relive old glory buddy? point flu's existence last 60 years mild enough that's worth cost eradicate it. That's true another month two

Where anyone say month two eradicate it. current peak two months. press conference 1,000,000 doses 6,500 pharmacies. doses addition doses already scheduled states. still need qualify based state rules. Yup - vaccinated Sept always optimistic timeline, announcement made much realistic. Serum institute confident enough since preproduced millions doses soon signing contract Oxford/AZ. EU could asked Oxford/AZ start production earlier didn't. i'm SoCal literally mid-70's sunny, mass vaccination sites work states torrential rain blizzard-like conditions keep pounding areas weeks end? get breezy conditions cancel vaccinations tents may go flying. put vaccines eyeball Da Lol. UK already vaccinated people (a large percentage received AZ vaccine). think they've able achieve starting production December 30th? Yessss! Zoo Science Center top two list! little one obsessed animals she’s ever seen dog car lol. can’t even imagine look face sees giraffe something!! aquarium splash park also list! Go off?

You realize measures required last year, solid 9-10 months late here. like mandatory hotel quarantine.

This yet another reactive instead proactive measure federal government. investment going make significant contribution current innoculation effort. Best case, going yield 2 million doses per month starting July. known anything scale up, nothing ever goes wrong, right?

When govt like UK boosting domestic manufacturing last year, govt relying foreign production. they've bitten US EU, scrambling around find domestic manufacturing (US EU nothing wrong prioritizing citizens, imo). Right. forgot one, double dose single dose? That's interesting. clear, say herd immunity, mean enough less R, full immunity sense spread all.

Do think possible hit sort herd immunity among groups (church goers, front-line workers, people throw parties etc) earlier, think all? 1M. addition 10.5M states. Last week 10M total overall increase 1.5M. Looks like increasing every week right now.

6000 pharmacies get 40000. get fully ramped up, would expect March, giving well 3M shots day.

Just point note. look Israel see quickly vaccinating (1 world). blew us population, would going rate 6M/day. me, that's high water mark shoot for. can't put politely, incredibly naive think EMA completely independent political lobbyist pressure (it German pressure made ""hurry"" approving Pfizer Astra Zeneca's vaccines), Europe pragmatic enough lose chance annoy Russia. Right wrong, countless examples recent years Europe going directly interests give finger Russia. entire political spectrum many eastern european countries number 1 policy ""be anti Russia"" voters like it.  agree American lockdown. definitely agree concept lockdown. Using lockdown get handle exploding virus great. gotta push mitigation like said. Masks, banning social gatherings, etc. Lockdowns work people follow public health measures set place afterwards. can't call 3 month lockdown. nothing except fatigue people give less compliance less invasive public health measures come afterwards. constant stay home orders CA, losing confidence people. see peers partying disregarding less invasive mitigation measures lockdown fatigue. Exactly. Rational people UK know Pfizer/Moderna/Novavax much better vaccines UK US sharing vaccines all. They're talking political ideology parents... fantastic news. single dose efficacy higher anticipated, two dose efficacy around 80% given dosing schedule recommended UK, zero hospitalizations vaccinated group (compared 15 control group). UK, Italy, Spain exercise rational thinking basic compassion? not?

Spain Italy got overwhelmed partly first outside Asia, partly social, dense population, partly tendency multi-generational housing close family groups.

The UK bumbled way there's excuses there.

Pretty scary reality.  totally agree. Pool basketball money, funnel PPE teacher/first responder/hospital staff/etc salary, increased testing vaccines won’t matter anyway.

Yeah let's listen high school dropouts instead. Clearly made best decisions. That’s suspected: less viral load, therefore less replication, ultimately less chance mutation. I’m biologist though, gotta ask.

Even Fauci, also optimist, least tact less saying ""Well, know yet, chance XYZ could happen."" 

Back March 2020, Osterholm Rogan's podcast breath fresh air clarity, lately, I'm getting really tired guy. respect credentials scientific knowledge, dwarfs mine, he's atrocious communicator. Every time speaks can't help pray he's either wrong hyperbolic. Phrases like ""COVID hell"" ""category 5 hurricane"" emotionally charged almost propaganda-like nature; fill people despair fear. let's forget November, predicted we'd see ""hospitals literally verge collapse"" (direct quote!) within next months. 

And hopelessness doom gloom, dude audacity go podcast last week tell shitty story WWII general refused give face certain defeat that's great example also give in, reason. 

Sorry, realize kinda turned rant. lot displaced anger too. American hear great cheap drugs Canada.

I'm saying that's untrue Canada change, fact making vaccines house, going wait result. hope goes fast possible.

Also feeling summer there's going lot vaccine floating around countries ordered need. first might big issue worldwide supply is. verify this? Enough guy, stop scaremorgering! value ""good number"" changes based efficacy.

Simplified, let's say we're talking herd immunity instead decrease infection rates. Imagine herd immunity occurs 70% population immunity. many people need vaccine get herd immunity 70% effective vaccine? Everyone! 95% effective vaccine occurs 73.6% population. potentially reporting issue, state problems tracking system showing massive backlog vaccines sitting shelves destinations without administered reality delayed delivered administered yet due arriving others administered get reported properly back state meant lot ""available"" doses reported locations already administered every dose received.

It pretty eye opening imagining that. I've always minor introvert, thinking NEEDING around people made tired. kind helped understand actually difficult time extroverts. get virus... Sorry obviously think really serious they're afraid getting vaccine Sorry translations perfect said ""I think choose name sputnik one english words borrowed Russian"" know ppl get vaccinated, less daily case get. it’s relevant Netherlands, pretty strict lockdown R older variant around 0.9, R one new variants 1.03, become dominant striain days. means somehow take even stricter measures before.

Good job trial data come back saying actually could **better** longer gap. get 6th dose syringe/needle pretty consistently, *occasionally* get 7th using vanish point syringes. Either way, nice right tool job.  perhaps importantly all, data found even one recipient vaccine became severely ill Covid-19 requiring hospitalisation

This important info. one stab eliminates need even elderly become hospitalized, covid becomes another annoying cold longer immediate public health threat. Get get shot everyone's arm.

Obviously time tell whether still long-term effects covid vaccine, clearly saving lives. virus wants socialize. UK vaccination policy near-perfect. produce covid vaccines need yearly ease export Europe + beyond. Investing skilled manufacturing like good idea, especially given much research behind occurs too. hope investment science continued grants money given universities, though much faith. Yes, ideally. Assuming 16 get need 80% people want means need 200M people vaccinated. number seeing end June supplies get 300M people vaccinated. matter get paid

You're missing point. He's implying/trying get see make money product produce creates lot jobs.

Which like totally obvious thing.

So course people reddit really get it.  First grade teacher teaching person 24 children here: uh, no. need vaccines. know it’s like working closely six year old barely keep mask on?

I'm assuming everyone went second shot faster.  dilute vaccine, must use within certain time. Say there's 10/vial, need ppl multiples 10 (e.g. 41 ppl means 9 shots waste).

If 5 shots/vial, 41 ppl. Means 4 shoots wasted.

Now imagine 20 shots.

Like friends WFH we've mass testing available city since May. absolutely seeing responsibly one caught COVID. discussing risk levels one another, ensuring safe otherwise, etc. 

I also agree; flattening curve overwhelming hospital system. finally drop-off manageable, let people live lives choose. overly cautious stay home longer they'd like, risk level ourselves. Yeah don’t think issue approval. Politics crazy game real world things lot grounded reality dealing everyday life things, like health. Russians always great things ability make largest nuclear bomb history well space achievements proved ability keep , surpass many cases. I’m progress think someone like Fauci, someone representative mental health, someone representing small businesses advisors equal influence talking spokesperson President take say turn policy coherent message.

Hearing Fauci quoted directly press makes cringe. seems likely. everyone. Trump never got better President. like 10k. numbers go include coaches etc.

Still, that's drop ocean compared country 120m people. Entirely realistic, UK 3 months vaccines anyway CNN never anything real scientific journals. made AZ charge $50 everyone would want it. me? company even sent Chinese partners masks January 2020 idea would come here. much estimated severity spring. cost lives. give vaccine people risk. policy stupid lead deaths   believe Putin's daughters took it. also reason believe couldn’t vaccinate 150 people 150 doses.

Because 150 people need second dose weeks. sure we've vaccines generations.

Yes, we’re talking specifically Covid vaccines. Russians *were* first register it- deemed reckless premature time- luckily ended lie.

It literally first registered Covid vaccine anywhere. take two seconds google instead doubling down. Well guess depends goals are. 

Are stop virus punish people don’t like? 

If they’re stop virus, black athletes top list. USA said 'do another trial' shut up. 

EU politicians actively trying undermine it, every chance get. also stands VX get say anything different. mistaken anti-mitigation

This. Yeah, claiming vaccine back like... June? 3 months between? Lousy unrealistic. Say want russia putin, russian science always top crop.

I would take it, questions asked.  wonder much spread could mitigated actual mask quality standard tied mask mandates.

And initial message ""Wear CDC approved mask"" instead ""here's fabric pattern make mask"" Curevac? vaccine? (no mention Curevac article BTW) reading several posts, engaging successful search vaccine high risk person 65, I’m asking people consider vax line cutting?

I see 3 scenarios:

A. use money/connections cut line

B. hang around wait excess vaccines would otherwise go waste

C. actively search vaccine outside home state ineligible home state.

Which vilifying not? NAbs bloodstream tissues block entry virus mucsocal surfaces nose. need NAbs virus enters produce sterilizing immunity entirely prevent infection totally prevent shedding.

You get i.m. injections arm all, post pretty flu vaccines produce sterilizing immunity, requires set specific immune responses existing vaccines administration SARS-CoV-2 vaccine MIGHT produce sterilizing immunity (this bit better blog post above, vaccines produce sterilizing immunity (don't good reference literature this'll do, since scouring literature day NAbs bloodstream sterilizing immunity.

As ACE2+mucosal immunity possible, that's something TWiV video awhile back bring time time, good references one. one subject matter expert asserted pretty strongly. understanding since ACE2 surfaces get infected NAbs. virus able enter mucosal surfaces. able find tissues nose NAbs ACE2 infect them. get innate + T-cell responses tissues inflammation immune response combat disease, NAbs bloodstream prevent transmission tissues, viral replication happen. Since virus infect cells directly mucosal surfacs cells never express antigens MHC B-cell NAbs responses never happen mucosal surfaces, even though virus swimming around there. Clearly there's experts hopeful intranasal vaccination produce sterilizing immunity though based papers cited (they're biased though since they're pushing nasal vaccine, assume people automatically like mice). also clearly stated papers none existing vaccines approved produce sterilizing immunity wrong NAbs titers blood. matters NAbs are.

Well hope see data many people dying could protected  Yeah totally think deserves matter. vaccines go people quickly stop spread disease.

My grandma, lives aunt uncle, particularly high risk. got vaccine first sounds wrong. volunteer shelter jobs need world. grandma basically home whole time people going vaccinated much safer. even better they've vaccinated. even gave grandma vaccine even though she'd covid.

It's pretty large weight chest come terms fact early pandemic likely see again. tired crap... ""some survivors"" like many? chosen? health conditions? long run study statistically significant number people?

I've seen many articles like based informal poll 50-100 people one hospital peer review anything. feel problem lies fact months anyone epidemiologist officials people listened to. left fields economics psychology widely left behind.

Also people academia really deal ""people problems"" explanation slowed production two weeks prepare factories faster manufacturing vaccines - lie (why would they?) seeing effect efforts. heard someone $7k bill ambulance ride. That's just.... wow. Blows mind. obscene. Well small lively towns, castles, nice people, exxageration honest. Romanian way...  would need vaccine booster 2 targets. two vaccines 2 boosters each. Also, respond one antibody spike protein. That's even reduced efficacy still efficacy. Basically mutation evades antibodies all, basically thing wanted. exactly right mindset. overthink - shots great improvement nothing, greatly reduce epidemic transmission rates well individual risk severe disease. advantage developed country long symptoms? COVID antibody tests came back negative, probably something else. never “normal” it’s gonna us long haul like flu ... may weaken it’ll here..  AwardshareReportSave

You really earned downvotes thread! powerful one free countries ever existed. Since WWII maintained global system free trade allowed absolutely unprecedented amount global growth. entire modern world built back America decided police seas participating free trade (as opposed previously history global powers would conquer market hold captive).

There country could replace America's role world (and probably when) America steps back next couple decades there's going lot 'friction' countries worry security seventy years. like order vaccines world? agree. understand countries seeing high cases large control pandemic, UK country high numbers cases, save thousands lives.

But guess certain countries may secure supply UK feel comfortable guaranteeing 2nd dose. You’re asking wrong guy. don’t know nothin bout  Clear plastic bags cheaper, prevent 100% deaths Covid sealed properly  vaccine? Typically 80-90% protect Pfizer Moderns starting 2 weeks shot. However still get 2nd shot. could use science actually manufacture vaccine paid manufacture six months ago.  Lucky him.  Hang bud, feeling way today. felt better day passed. You’re alone. look singing elsewhere that’s really case. Like local pharmacies. There’s multiple lists sign state state county health department list  opinion watching hospitalizations best indicator. timely fatalities represent real impact people health care system. Cases vary lot severity really telling. think right cusp vaccines making major difference hospitalizations across country. 1 million ship 6,500 pharmacies Feb. 11

That seem like much.. that's average ~150 per pharmacy week. That's 20 shots day, 10 people day. entire pharmacy effectiveness gives info. best metric. would like know vaccines tested newest variants. usually brings efficacy. Also good news hospitalizations deaths uniformly good among vaccines. means see deaths hospital utilization go intimate goal. save people get sick reduce deaths due causes. would bring death rate Norma levels life would go back normal. people jobs. 
You can't magically say 65 cutoff age numbers worldwide indicate 60+ high risk.  UK calling cynical political move think stupid.

Are they? seen anything. know there's enough data 65s. threat seems much lower threat coronavirus may impose heart. wrong?

I also worried lower efficacy vaccination. currently really worried dying virus, worried long term effects. chronic inflammatory issue right now, I'm pretty scared inflammation virus causes anything. Yeah yeah know, 60% great, die, great. saying say matter definitely get best one can. remember reading post someone said something along lines of, ""in news, life jacket helps keeps drowning ocean also prevents drowning lake."" company seems getting strict despite us vaccinated. It’s really frustrating. data 75+ Pfizer/BioNTech concerns there.

There concerns even reported complications terminally hill frail elders, could caused potential deaths, report Norway.

And there's wide range health issues 60-75.

EMA job, there's enough data approve it? Vietnam one wonderland places covid?  Thanks!!! Indeed. far looks like we'll lot vaccines Q2/Q3 meet goal. facility need future knows, maybe future virus - maybe it'll start cranking booster shot Covid variants next. That's actually really good know. elderly family members got first dose, think breathe bit easily even get second shot. Thank you! can't drink alcohol it. suspect domestic travel person college school back full swing fall. Minor mitigations, like covid tests students lower occupancy rooms might still around.

And want date ScarJo. Neither going achieve desire. Yes overall matters transmission number infections group, asymptomatic+symptomatic Nobody wants work though, surging staffing already proving difficult likely factor found ones holding unused doses. Nope must've creepy experience. Like, imagine seeing people wearing masks talking death rate, knowing what's happening.  vaccinated less 8,000 people entire country yesterday. see people perceive problem. coincidence curve starts plummet immediately 2nd doses start rolling out. Love see Would said thing NBA players white? form changed lot year. went one places taking covid seriously, influx people worried it, last month half many people treating news everything though it’s media wanting views cdc profiting somehow. Yeah would. I'm sure would even work many people pulling ""vaccines area religion"" card Facebook already.

I'm sure key factor fast supply ramped though

Let's say hypothetically get adults want vaccine taken care get hundred million storage, would mean one month trials every kid could doses...or Johnson Johnson, days afterwards could taken care of

That said, much area schools going back full person cases dropped 20/100k per day though person even 100/100k required breathalyzer ignitions every car America since 2000, could saved 200,000 lives prevented many hospitalizations.

JnJ also testing second shot 57 days later. heard experts apply idea MRNA vaccines. hard data it.

But really answer ""of course do."" 100% means, merely making COVID asymptomatic -- getting rid coughing -- inherently make virus *less* transmissible simply infected people spewing viruses far frequently.

The question *how much* reduce transmission, ""if."" ...

every single vaccination get kid administered months boosters. body needs time ""study"" invaders commit long term T-cell memory.. (and B-cells need learn spike proteins go back ""***march 2020""*** (start vaccine trials first cases US)

pretend said Phase 1 going start 4 month gap..

that means Phase 2 would start July..

phase 3 November.

phase 3 finish ***NEXT MONTH.***

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**not acceptable.**

so run 4 weeks trials... nothing like vaccination ""standard"" Poor Laika.

Fucking humans. willing outspoken fans (The Elvis effect). pedantic. understood meant ""liberal birth rates,"" feel that's confusing, either correct move on. That’s damn funny. -the antivax thing. hadn’t proven effective yet. 30-40% effective, they’d injected tons people something useless. 30 people 40,000 person trial serious side effect, would translate 75,000 injuries.

I’m glad it’s safe trustworthy, I’d take shot, stunt pulled August fucking stupid. There’s reason many Russians passing He's right this. Literally every NBA broadcast would serve vaccine infomercial. Agree, read earlier one definitely optimistic. guess read “yea we’re pushing goal post little bit variance, end still near.” guess it’s matter perspective.  Thanks, good is, I’m hoping something that’s little programmed Q/A response tree sorts... 

You say, “but it’s around long enough prove it’s safe”

I reference cheat sheet respond simplified answer citations (if needed) clearly gives clear, simple rational answer debunking “facts” they’re citing also ideally heads future stupid arguments. 

Your list good interested reading —and/or exploring more. It’s great honestly —but supplemental terms I’m looking for. 

Your post made ask this, FYI. frustrating 'whatabout' change anything. Russia's government dishonest. Even another government accusing something precisely dishonest... change? may make one hypocrite something, still address original point.  living rock, right? Russia flat lying anything makes policy making look anything less superb last 20 years. vaccine came months ago? lot people careful distancing, masks cleaning hands. Yeah, let's also distrust Pfizer vaccine shit Trump done. update McKinsey forecast lot pessimistic month ago. says “may” begin transition normalcy Q2 it’s likely still “strong public health measures”, makes attempt see forecasting actual normalcy, care about. It’s sad appreciate trying right thing obviously restrictions working. 1 MILLION PEOPLE DIE EVERY YEAR CAR ACCIDENTS. need hunkering traveling improve car safety. 

Is driving club worth senseless deaths? I've close friends die car accidents agree imposed restrictions heartless selfish. # FDA, APPROVE US ASAP!!! supposed good news, mean, worst pandemic... I’m pretty sure cases involved people getting sick either immediately vaccine, immunity hits.  fairly decent population point level natural immunity

The P1 variant still concern here, hence Brazil limits many countries. 66% antibodies, ripped second wave worse first, like even there.

But I'm cautiously optimistic. one thing *would* heck lot genomic surveillance, coming hard anything tending upwards vaccinations roll out, assuming that's done nothing comes up, pretty damn good position summer.  weird bubble helmets, see those? good, glad see supply still coming  So, like said start, exercise rational thinking basic compassion.

At first though. Here's history Germany; ""daily new cases"". this. see second surge started? summer vacation season kids went back school. utter stupidity stupidity even work hard. data 75+ Pfizer/BioNTech concerns there. find strange EU countries wait EMA's marketing authorisation national agency give different advice. going diverge might well gone emergency authorisation national medicines agency like UK did. Maybe give one dose altogether lok  manufacturer? applies viral vector vaccines. Pfizer Moderna viral vector issue Hey, Tim's reworked dark roast blend recently. People split it, think better.  point much do, 73 y\o mother to. I'am waiting VAX effective national talk it. I’d take taking AstraZeneca shot tbh. I’d take whatever get I’m taking 2 shots, I’d rather 62-70% effective. AZ enough old people data meet FDAs requirements (same reason France Poland giving vaccine under-65s). trials emphasise older people finishing near future, presuming data good, it'll likely approved late Feb/March. 

AZ probably focusing non-western markets though, given ease manufacture transport. thoroughly good egg. remember people brushed aside Russian vaccine joke propaganda show.

Turns first successful Covid 19 Vaccination...and released August *last year*. Correct. They’re addition state-run efforts. :) NPR said specifically couple Argentina last week think mass people rolling in.  Yeah, people making lot false claims spreading false information. example- many areas US locked Spanish Flu. hospitalized.

Zero hospitalized Fine, give top 10 players ad campaign. players, executives, coaching staff etc wait turn. Envious ways Mutations top mutations... thought scientists said virus limits concerning mutations! Summer. fine. one use soonest, point that, multiple vaccines imported available, busy vaccinating risk groups, simply use AZ 65, others over. one faster slower other, giving different ones different groups Mouthwash came topic John Campbell's recent video, thought interesting.

Some previous studies shown gargling water (often used placebo) effective. u bot? hell Xenophobic towards Russia? government notorious lieing everything (they convicted sent jail guy ran Putin 'fair' election). Doctors falling window since day one virus Russia. mention online disinformation campaign.

I trust Russia much trust china, that's fat zero. Transition normal Q2 2021 depressing? Q2 starts April 1st! can’t tell cities indoor dining haven’t seen tremendous spike? positive news everyone really. vaccine plants faster produce them. hopefully take alot pressure EU plants vodka lada vodka  Ah interesting! suspect gets bit stable low levels population would see pattern. every five years booster would seem like reasonable approach eventually yeah russia messed things politically mean smart scientists there. think main concern willing roll without testing western countries do.   Almost shills Reddit talking product inorder make financial gain. know would never happen, wallstreetbets, anywhere. Sorry homie died 100 importantly, anyway, developing countries cannot afford/have trouble temperature storage vaccine lifesaving. Go OXFORD!! 

Feel quite proud scientists one. dogs pass virus human?  you’re welcome :) fair somewhat public knowledge last February, idea worldwide issue.

I remember flying back Japan mid January reading cases found town visited like 3 days  tell missed vaccine. France recently too, that's mainly AZ enough trial data over-65s satisfy countries. suspect removed near-future trials emphasise older people finish. actually got little stated lower efficacy. ""Effects term"" mean anything. definition sterilizing immunity presence high enough titer neutralizing antibodies, binding antibodies prevents cell entry.

Preventing virus entering cells high affinity neutralizing antibodies literally main goal vaccines. 

Vaccines produce sterilizing immunity often vaccines definitely goal vaccines.

Could clarify meant say mucosal surfaces cells virus able infect ACE2? Ahh. Metal Gear Solid V approach naming.

All games English numbers. fifth game roman numeral ""V"".

One would think refers number 5. also refer code name protagonist ""V"". refer design ""Incsoc"" Orwells 1984. there's *lot* parrallels 1984 MGSV (also game set 1984). Instragram? Really? Reported misinformation. dad already took first shot avoid second one delay much possible dut take 26th 28 days first   Air filtration air sterilization mandatory restaurants. expensive compared increased viral transmissions wonder they’ll include gay rights activists genuinely like AIDS epidemic. mean takes 6 months get full vaccination US 3 months example. yeah we’ll see, US UK fairly well despite doom, Israel course beating everyone. really not, since already ""worse things"". taking side islamist forces dictator even worse Putin war generated one million refugees Germany because, well, side Russia. 

Also, Germany important force EU, extremely hard sell idea everyone west Berlin. block, slow considerably. completely rule EMA approving Sputnik V, time happens, useless market already well supplied.

It want, course. want see every effort thrown minimizing deaths spring get us situation. sadly political games always important. explain lower risk rate ""ground maintenance workers"" ""maids""? could argue share overlapping demographics. Sadly, that's thruth going around sub.

 leave want read ""scary news"" ""goalposter headlines"" scientists experts, clearly ""think"" virus expertise virologists studied whole life. predict five figure daily #s within month Pretty sure serious applies every decision life. Pfizer vaccine 95% effective Moderna 94.5% effective. AZ 100% efficacy stopping severe disease (it’s 70% effectiveness tested asymptomatics). low chance you’ll get serious COVID case vaccination. risk massively decreases 2 weeks getting second dose (that’s full vaccination reached). Multiply fact issues COVID immune system also deal it. words, masks distancing risk assessment risk getting disease low, masks distancing redundant point.

Do worry all. Let vaccine body everything you. Live life like 2019. Mental health important physical health, getting depression/dystopia feelings masks/distancing worse getting disease full vaccination. would say it’s convenient since it’s cheaper doesn’t require deep freezing, agree doubtful used US really unfortunate become *our* personal responsibility follow research know actual situation is.

All information broadcast mainstream media becomes common knowledge.  never intention stay rate. never going get piddle Q1. start getting million doses per week Q2 increasing there. September target still possible.

Pfizer also says able fill order bit quicker anticipated starting Q2, due factory upgrades. Though remains seen (skeptical hopeful).

In Q2/3 we'll suddenly go LOT vaccines. There'll slow ramp practice, training wheels. hope health authorities planning well. Lol that's gonna happen, least way intended be. Japan strict entry policy right highly doubt lifted literally millions people every country coming in. foreign fans likely no-go (or least limited capacity). there's thousands athletes staff need vaccinated and/or quarantined two weeks prior actual pre-Olymics on-site training. That's gonna smooth country yet even start vaccine trials. Also, state Japan's covid crisis uncertain since routinely anywhere 13k-60k tests/day country 127 million--nowhere near enough ensure community spread low enough medical experts give green light. Further, Olympic tryouts may need redone certain countries athletes come Olympic contention. ALSO, many countries may even participate (I mean, Morocco gonna send athletes people yet vaccinated?).

Going ahead Olympics stupid financial move, it'll leave sour taste millions' people's mouths fans majority Japanese-only several-to-dozens countries participate. That’s issue. People gathering indoors tiny apartments instead spaced tables first registered vaccine world.

Pretty sure we've vaccines joke isn’t funnier third time repeat either.

Neither lie. decreases odds getting spreading Covid less two shots. Cuomo governor NY fucker said trust experts 2 weeks, kept flip-flopping predictions normal return. said full normal fall, full normal summer, semblance normal fall. data indicates current vaccines *very* effective known variants, unlikely we'd see variant escape vaccine effectiveness enough ""send us back drawing board."" 

**""Less effective"" mean ""not effective""**, especially dealing figures like 95%. 

We *what-if* day long, scenario describe basically likely brand new pandemic something unrelated Covid. *Possible*, sure. likely enough waste energy worrying about. think difficult understand group individuals particular would particularly skeptical lack trust healthcare system. low percentages... wondering going on. Forgot guys got snow north. hardly see stuff anymore. 

In OK, talking increasing appointments place. 500 extra today Tulsa, plus another company coming extra 1,200 appointments week. Np Plus want teams able beat Maple Leafs, Canucks Oilers et al fall. They’re necessary evil atm prevent spread virus community setting. personal level would rather live world without tho That's number 3 days since update all. admitted making herd immunity numbers based public perception much info could handle, huge red flag everyone paying attention. number flip flops he's made astounding. think I'm still confused appreciate effort. depends many doses have. AZ vaccine shown least efficacious wide margin would better allocated less vulnerable - means vulnerable wait.

Of course, vaccinating vulnerable first mitigation move. suppression scenario, want vaccinate super-spreaders first keep vulnerable (along everyone else) catching all. depends country state live in. I'd say majority people vaccinated countries probably longer masks mandates could either summer late year depending fast country vaccinating Ohh little indeed, really hope able get doses. EU getting reduced deliveries lately well, though severely cut that. But, plant back full speed, new plants put production already, hopefully enough us all. weeks bad news, suddenly pharmaceutical companies EU projecting increased revenues coming months. 

And indeed, faster US is, faster they'll willing export well. UK US sign deals saying export vaccines, EU did. agree export something export it, nothing said. Doesn’t sound scientific like pretend don’t speak Russian Absolutely nothing selfish wanting live life. can't treat like lepers forever. sick, sure stay home. everyone at-risk around vaccinated absolutely justification someone else manage risk you. get fun, need re-normalize social interaction avoid patronizing virtual ""distanced"" events summer. TX numbers go since yesterday. Numbers MO 50k behind numbers site. Tuesday seems low day CDC updates reality definitely somewhat better this. 

Still, disappointing see lower updates last Tuesday; hopefully tomorrow improvement.  initial message ""don't wear mask"" anything would CDC approved needed medical workers. timing message change mask supplies finally level general population get KN95 masks.

I agree, point needs standard sub-standard masks banned. Masks exhalation valves big danger beginning (all anti-smog, Asian sport masks finding new market), least eventually identified and, least company, banned. still people going store 3M respirators dump exhaled air directly without filtering way.

The ideal would everyone KN95 surgical mask perfect world would issued masks government March. Слово «спутник»? Оно ни в каком языке больше не используется, насколько мне известно. Based - opposite cringe : via UrbanDictionary  April, celebrating first human get injected COVID-19 vaccine trials starting. Yep, caveat family vaccinated. get full doses I'm going go gym though, certainly feel guilty frequenting outdoor bars want. Variations number daily cases always fluctuate depending many tests done. dsyd testing lower cases course lower. see France example yesterday less 5,000 cases today 20,000 cases. Better looking 7 day moving average cases gives better indication whether cases decreasing increasing Unfortunately, none big international alliances feel like claiming supporting us present. Unfortunately mother one them. So, I'm old now, someone explain slang me? response mean? 558,458 increase CDC today vs 806,751 last Tuesday, probably due expected, doses distributed increased nearly 3M. day day numbers pretty ""lumpy"" based tests run results come in. Monday usually spike includes numbers weekend etc. Best look like weekly averages. Good luck that. Eh, it’s summarizing recent statements Michael Osterholm, correctly predicted back September winter wave would horrible worse anything seen yet. right. 

I’m seeing variety concerned various virologists epidemiologists new strains, general rule, don’t take Osterholm’s warnings lightly. Right. Training functional immune system fight disease ton value. Training system can’t fight disease doesn’t make much difference. doesn’t matter immune system recognize threat can’t put fight. never said anonymized, sending info reason Pfizer giving doses MSM antivaxxers really stupid nurses (and doctors) Хоpoшо Stay strong brudda. shouldn’t need explain kid got vaccine. That’s one problems... CVS, Walgreens, Walmart distributing vaccine Illinois. Man daft. stated fact: Wed/Thurs stock $170, Tuesday $163. Friday went back $163. Yesterday today $163. Facts matter. disputed use word plummet first post using actual values dispute it.
You wrote ""J&amp;J getting KILLED media stock plummeting. Absolutely unfair."" Agreed would unfair true. getting KILLED media, stock price change normal range follow market all. stock dropped $20, argue -- would ""plummeting"" -- continued drop time, argue, stable $163. reality, $163 market puts value right &amp; probably bumped two days anticipation results higher trading volume earnings call last week. Full disclosure, long position JNJ &amp; concerned least return level support $163; long able fulfill billion doses vaccine year, quarterly earnings call last week also positive &amp; continue deliver good value blue chip high yield stock shown growth potential.
 
I absolutely defend characterization efficacy results J&amp;J vaccine. expected similar AZ adenoviral based vaccines researchers experts, hoping anything 50% get FDA emergency approval, unlikely reach mid 90s mRNA based vaccines. want talk disappointing -- Merck's covid vaccine efforts terminated due insufficient immune response. Merck major manufacturer many vaccines, long history success, shows challenging make effective vaccines. stock took small hit well BTW, also plummet LOL. 
 
The public media see 60-70% JNJ AZ vaccines misplace expectations due unusually high efficacy Pfizer Moderna vaccines. change fact 60-70% efficacy extremely good &amp; vaccines available reduce severity disease help things get back normal. think disagree this, apart statement J&amp;J getting ""KILLED"" media, still say hyperbole. 
 
To end optimistic note: J&amp;J vaccine potential improve 2-dose regimen trial still ongoing, either improved duration immune response actual efficacy % (take account comparing single dose J&amp;J two dose AZ, Pfizer &amp; Moderna regimens...). Let's wait data speak itself. Australia example incredibly strict, California 

Do really want argue Florida australia position? 

Also California STILL fewer deaths per capita Florida Currently doses shipped states decide many send hospitals, pharmacies, etc. Cuomo New York criticized sending doses hospitals generally set administer public, maybe intended health care workers.

The way really achieve mass vaccination send pharmacies, 40,000+ around country. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

India manufactures vaccines World Health Organization, distributes vaccines developing countries includes Pakistan program called COVAX Around May first 100 days end, people sick masks weather becomes warmer. know downvoted, reasonable take. lucky enough already vaccinated would still complying legal guidelines- law stage people, especially cashier local store, vaccinated. can't see I'd want unnecessarily stress someone helping can't handle fabric face minutes store. Would making much effort isolate though? Likely not. like say, masks go away people vaccinated. Yes. need know. data stellar, course. 

But lived rare &amp; debilitating chronic illness 25 years life (now remission) don’t plan go back chronically debilitating state. So...still super cautious. I'm assuming they'll start go area-by-area things go well dependent deaths hospitalizations (and let's honest, politics region affect quickly long stay). They'll go eventually, suspect one last, last measure go entirely.

That said, predict I'd say sometime mid-to-late summer early fall they'll gone good. least hope lol bloody hope so, need pint shite. “Brutal” lmao Ah ok. Yeah agree. It’s almost like lockdown stuff isn’t public health. never said that. 90 year olds risk vaccinated die strategy. hope politics rather policy see Oof. Rough day office. down. Anyway, mot related directly post, last memory best. Plus FL cases deaths per capita California lot health officials starting shy away question restrictions place certain time future. 1) it’s hard predict months advance 2) know they’re ultimately political decisions.  find sorts examples actions taking contrary medical advice everything covid. Kyle Korver would never talk this, respectful. rest virus?  Agreed. I’m pointing don’t really take drastic measures society prevent death much lockdowns would us think do. understand concept perfectly explain well. it’s people do. small group 6 lifelong friends seeing places outside, restaurants park, went inside got infected. well virus make rules insist. Pfizer planned already gonna production J&amp;J + Novavax coming viable vaccines. less effective, vaccines seem preventing death, still offer good protection severe cases. 94-95% effectivness infection seeing original virus. get deaths hospitalizations still get mess end lockdowns, point worse flu really. Would bee quite sting bumble without hexpecting them, bug 'em enough they'll stop combing buzz off. program, begin rolling February 11, start 6,500 stores receive total 1 million doses eventually expanding, Zients said.

That's average 154 doses per pharmacy. good start lot needed.

I wonder compare existing system shipping states choose ship (varying state) pharmacies. think masks good? Wanna hear side bro. heh, never knew one lot people would died things next year died covid past year. last memory him, considering post him. sad hear. I’m hoping increase production plus approval Johnson Johnson least mean vaccination speed allow vaccination efforts Canada able speed well. think understand vaccine trails work. 

But Oxford ? Lmao . trial fucked miracle anyone accepted it. normal circumstances regulators would laughed office. Yeah great question - endgame? 

I’ve tried remain positive throughout variant news cycle. I’ve tried tell others get beaten negative news, especially non-scientific media. 

I’ve tried remain positive remind main reason avoid hospitals overwhelmed, 5 covid vaccines 100% success rate keeping recipients hospital, even South African variant (almost immunity binding antibodies produced), there’s evidence data moment suggest future mutations this. 

I’ve tried remain positive tell *all respiratory viruses mutate avoid binding antibodies*, doesn’t mean protective immunity bodies create rendered useless - otherwise wouldn’t flu kill rates similar previous pandemics similar times first introduced novel virus new population? 

I try remain positive tell *even everything said wrong* - experts like Scott Gottlieb say looks like mutations predictable slow enough develop booster shots stay ahead virus. 

But really want hear leaders, decision makers - case everything wrong - plan effing B. Keep public health restrictions 5 years? things forever? Kids never play friends again. Students enter highschool years told, ‘sorry - life remote now’? Young adults told - sorry, weddings you’ve dreamed *too dangerous*? Grandparents never come Christmas anymore, *you might kill them*, even though say it’s worth risk ? **Or** choose move forward every human generation pandemics disease - accept higher levels risk rates death. don’t know guys, given choice two take latter 11 times 10. 

Sorry. rant, maybe get Reddit avoid news little while. really hope plan works - least % it. really scares people think plan B completely alter live lives never look back. hope world leaders aren’t thinking same. think compliance enforcement greatly eased summer, rules officially set aside fall (depending state/country) think spot on. Basically, miss 11 month period past 30 years, pick past 11 months? Thanks. know exactly feel Blyat  even funnier fact: used spelled differently: ""миръ"" ""мiръ"". letter gone Russian alphabet they're spelled same: ""мир"" Got COVID May, got sick December tested negative.

So got sick COVID something else 2020! Giving life loved ones 13 months opposite selfish. Portugal’s hospitals overrun. UK desperately door door testing try find SA variant spreads further.

I'm UK we're vaccine thing, completely ignoring fact new variant rips ages like nothing seen.

Heres infection rates age (per 100k) town Kent, place started. Darker higher rate infection

 also hospital admissions data second part year, shorter period saw massive rise admissions. 18s daily admission 7 first period, second daily admission rate 18....

Ultimately, pay attention new variants....

 50 percent healthcare worker sample symptoms, even mild. around 80 percent general pop, prevents severe symptoms every cases. Hopefully not, needles going cock sounds horrific, I'd rather get virus. sure, everything's fine, would hope students pursuing pre-med would smart enough pass undergraduate intro chem organic chem. Also, think children exposed would normally. aren’t though. Osterholm thinks worst yet come variants hit hard March. I’m sure believe lot credentials. Wow turnaround time really fast! pfizer. Chills day one. Joint pain increased heart rate 7 days. i'm certified cna. work cna right now. considered getting vaccine.  


and thought would keeping people like mother. people need more.  


so get vaccine. seems pattern less M-F weekends massive jump near future live, nursing home workers get paid less Target cashiers. could get another job, working nursing home. Yes stopped testing happy ? euros fine. empty hospital fake news propaganda please euros . mean mistake reported 2nd highest numbers world flu season india . stopped testing butt hurt euros superior entitlement cones way see better Job. 

We get one outside superior west better showing statistic says others lie obviously Even so, like Singapore backwater shanty town, GDP per capita actually higher US's got 29 Covid deaths... Rest Peace Ass Dan Yeah sort levels orthodox. know nice normal people there’s ones like Unorthodox Netflix need get grip go outside. god.  whole point cut doctor salaries can, always take note doesn’t compare US law salaries overseas law salaries, it’s excellent tell.

Nor ever get lost decade, time cost medical school, impact higher taxes. talks pretax unadjusted earnings primary care doctors $62/hr (and let’s real here, tradesmen make $62/hr taxes).

When adjust earnings inputs get $32/hr.

I know cause live worked math guys like author trying say families like mine wealthy.

Where lawyers hack economists now? Certainly helping anyone CoVID19 wards. anyone questioning windfall probate lawyers? Completely anecdotal, rural areas smaller population states seem rolling bit faster. 

The logistics distribution large cities bit challenge, seem lagging bit terms people getting vaccine prevalence virus transmission urban areas, got two factors working big cities. 

Betting catch-up next weeks (my city setup 3 new ""vaccine super centers"" last week two, instance, takes first get supply second train/hire people work vaccine centers. Best thing get spinal cord stimulator. origin pain neck spine osteo/rheumatoid arthritis disk degenerative disease. stimulator work arthritic pain kind. took neuropathic pain. 

I getting torn nerve pain stimulator, adjust according activity proactively ahead nerve related pain. gave back hands shoulders full functionality. arthritis pain, take morphine, Demerol break pain, tizanadine, cloroaxazone muscle relaxant pain. 

The stimulator souped TENS unit. 2 modes, one mode constant flow electricity running 2 leads epidural space spine. Leads start generator lower flank back. feel anything lack pain. 

2nd mode like TENS unit. active, run mode, within seconds, neuropathy pain gone shoulders hands. kayaking, things reaching things on.

Surgery incredibly short. Trial surgery 25 minutes. Implant surgery hour. two surgical spots since problems upper back neck. lumbar, one surgical spots deal with.  Different styles syringes leave different amounts vaccine within done injection.

Imagine turning water garden hose attached. turn off, there’s still hose worth water wasted. limitation country supply; ~350MM (350,000,000) people US x 2 = ~700MM (700,000,000) doses needed consider vague type normal? way talking surprised idea ""some vague type normal"" dystopian nightmare. much evidence virus establishes latent infection like HPV herpesviruses.  understand mask mandate would make difference. 

Anywhere would enforce policies already anywhere policy going enforce anyway. say there's mandate, bus driver South Dakota still going enforce it. Way misrepresent Covid-19 task force co-chair Lawrence Wong said context. Everything else points 2021/2022 target. exact safe management measures like mask-wearing avoiding crowds continue year maybe good part next Beyond that, availability COVID-19 vaccinations progressively restart global travel, getting world vaccinated quick Government planned everyone Singapore vaccinated third quarter need really tide point everyone Singapore vaccinated, maybe third quarter year. Perhaps end year, solution add up, literally everything spouted bullshit. lockdowns. objectively. work. Based comes rapper Lil B, also known Based God. Based stands Bitches Sex Every Day. get folks r/numerology make completely arbitrary milestones know mean? 20,000 people take trial shot 20,000 people take placebo 

Then compare infection rates two.

The trial 95% less infections placebo. I'd buy one every month maybe twice month    rate new cases keeps plummeting, largely thanks vaccines

Largely? No. small part? Yes. 

We need hit well beyond 50% antibodies hit herd immunity. We've vaccinated less 10% US, well less 2nd dose. 

Most nationwide drop COVID-19 cases simply due states passing winter waves. Northern plain midwest states got hit HARD several weeks ago since got past peaks, cases dropping fast. States like California, Arizona, Texas, Georgia recently coming waves. hard give grace, sure! ADHD people tend overachievers people pleasers. causes us super hard executive dysfunction kicks in. 

I remind every day productive go go go. Burnout real everyone remember taking break OK! Sorry, parents right now, 70s still get vaccine time.. hope mild Simpsons reference yet still waiting get single dose country. death almost 6 months. would nice need worry outbreak. desparately hoping US complete vaccination June, us plebs Canada get some. good news care, we're habit washing everything comes house within sneezing touching distance humans, going stay way moving forward. None us much sniffle since last February. Yes germs good, immune system needs blah blah spare arguments. I'm sure get plenty exposure regardless. need house salmonella, e-coli, rotavirus, giardia, cryptosporidium, on. Humans fucking disgusting nose picking ass scratching lice carrying meatbags. Geez. didn’t know mono would stick around pop back up. never mono (to knowledge) know weeks. Holy cow. leave sub due comments questioning pros cons lockdowns. least refreshing hear sub considering different positions. Personally, think it’s important vaccinate many people possible rather vaccinate people exact right order. Better would actually eliminating minimum wage entirely. free market would sort out- McDonald’s wants try pay 6 bucks hour Los Angeles nobody work them. Vaccines wouldn’t come faster, less people would died.

And vaccine may found faster, manufacturers would better prepared ramp production.

We would’ve masks PPE secured. trump administration ignored American manufacturers wanted ramp production needed federal dollars explain capacity. impacted healthcare workers causes shortages.

States would clearer guidance consistent nationwide response. Instead 50 states 50 plans resulted rich people traveling Florida skip lines driving poorer communities color taking vaccine appointments online. Poorer communities technology gap older residents poorer areas less tech savvy therefore able book appointments. happening NYC.

More people would taken things seriously stayed home instead believing hoax miracle cures.

We’d also better data instead various states bungling death rates nationwide. 

With vaccines, better coordinated response, people taking seriously might able vaccinate country offer help poorer countries.

You seem ignoring that. kind hard argue administration others getting vaccines workers giving theirs. That's good one. Except hardly actual laws codifying covid restrictions. get fuzzy area lying medical results.  Realistically, vaccinated people really much worry about. buy much optimism. First week january includes lot surge lagging Christmas morons good chunk new years morons. 100 million vaccinated 100 days whatever statement aaa proven hyperbole daily rate vaccinations lead Biden’s inauguration would also hit number. yes correct. Hopefully admin shoot higher goals. necessarily, idiots think testing dangerous vaccines going turn gay something! I'd love work remotely Hawaii want wake 3 daily morning call What’s going happen 1 million vaccines donated Myanmar? would love Target mom right now. Anywhere house please! gave birth right COVID. first three months advise go anywhere crowded newborn didn’t go much... COVID hit right 🤦🏻‍♀️ mall sounds heavenly compared this. added security visiting elderly parents contracting transmitting virus 70% vs 95% needed. disagree... revenge garbage dump insurance land  Reddit literally become Facebook, Jesus Christ

Shut fuck ya goddamn idiot Looks like people immunosuppressed like people taking meds control autoimmune disease control organ transplant rejection weren’t included trials Pfizer least, would continue careful around family like got vaccine myself. Might work neck wood buddy, seen Europeans, Americans, South American currently.

Not everyone Taiwan, Australia, Singapore, whatever island nations competent population government Lol third wave. first one ever end US? common Yeah oversanitizing negative health effects people, mutation germs know? 

There office building Hong Kong noisy call center. bunch people one side one floor got sick. Almost one else building got sick. 

I think that's pretty strong evidence surface transmission really thing. Flatten curve always lie, take foot brake goes curve we've seen throughout world.
Crush curve successful strategy, failing left lessening damage far possible. milestone grim one? Hallelujah!   data even clear common long covid even is. Oh definitely guilting anything. Worried health issues. definition saw was...
A substance used stimulate production antibodies provide immunity one several diseases, prepared causative agent disease, products, synthetic substitute, treated act antigen without inducing disease.

It's provides immunity part confused me.

Look, you’re obviously smart, since you’re defending Trump, you’re still delusional. see 12-year plan accepting Trump administration chaotic disaster. post covid effects mind body? much data this, prevents disease cases, least reduces severity eliminates possibility hospitalization and/or death, one might argue also reduces chances large amount long COVID. cOVID-19 rarely spread surfaces we’re deep cleaning.

2) Money. They'll make it. [Provisional Death Counts Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 

Filter ""Yearly"". There's 8 week delay states. North Carolina Alaska 12-16 week delay. use snail mail death certificates, every state uses electronic submission. It’s politicians consider rich though, see readily definitions middle class tax code. one time stimulus nothing rich not.

But getting away issue, people underpaid.

Let’s look primary care doctors. work debt, taxes, lost years income, long hours, extra training, net $32/hr career total benefits, that’s high school teacher nets per hour total benefits (the doctor makes cents less per hour actually).

Teachers absolutely underpaid, primary care doctors netting hourly pay surely agree underpaid well. Still need second dose though companies involved present trials? think nice supermarket pretends wash scoops meant pick mix candy.

I think people disinfecting groceries something active right now. situation control individual. I'm sure OCD rise. Fair point. 


We’ve got six months data around schools country. Including public schools don’t even require masks students. trust public health officials would cite facts point schools can’t opened. Since hasn’t happened new administration hesitated make major Covid related statements conclude schools offer person education. So, caused inflammation heart muscle? immune response spike protein? 

I guess anything lipid nanoparticles supposed cause allergies cases? MONEY likelihood yes, assuming time passed.

For example new variant appears months J&amp;J's vaccine work well Pfizer's could go back get dose Pfizer vaccine. cheaper AZ?  awesome! Always thirsty good news days.  able least distance fairly well

Our classes able distance sufficiently back hybrid, since they’re trying fully person, there’s way older, cramped classrooms sit six feet apart. means every time there’s teacher student tests positive (which past weeks two **per day** school community less 1,000), sends whole bunch people quarantine EVERY class multiple students and/or teacher Zooming in. kids really need school save nightmarish home life follow rules pretty well.

Every functioning adult learned wear mask properly long point. 95% 60% even though vaccines numbers actually amazing. People understand science focus numbers without context.

Numbers *always* need context.

I think huge problem they're reported without context. know, J&amp;J vaccine good, numbers reported single dose longer wait become effective.

Something often mentioned people getting sick getting vaccine getting sick soon receiving it, without looking directly data (and, course, controlled experiment test this!), hard say much difference 95% 60% coming lag period much factors much actual difference efficacy vaccines.

There going uncertainty lot reasons, although one-sided uncertainty (I'd guess unlikely J&amp;J vaccine *better* others), asserting confidently J&amp;J vaccine worse wrong. Yeah seems knock people day two unlucky. flip side nothing symptoms wise lol. I'll find soon enough I'll land. Lol, saying experts can’t predict future better areas experts ignore predictions “they can’t know future 100% accuracy”? don’t think novel mutation case though. looks like extremely small amount samples analyzed UK variant (11 200,000 +) also mutation. don’t think indicator become prevalent mutation variant, much hasn’t “wild type” variant speculation; culmination year consuming absorbing news makes feel want people would taken things seriously stayed home instead believing hoax miracle cures.

-

Statements like product people trying find reasons constantly upset exasperated.  I’m labor supporter I’ll give credit Liberal state governments, done well. federal government hand done little outside welfare (which suggested opposition anyway). J+J specific part huge portions population

With Pfizer/Moderna, you’re less likely get symptomatic covid *at all*, J+J results still great news even doesn’t fully protect getting sick, pretty much eliminates severe covid + greatly reduces likelihood getting even “moderate” case - *and* it’s one dose, easier store/distribute, requires less specialized tech manufacture. “shots arms ASAP” standpoint, that’s awesome. I'm concerned about. one's expecting super covid. wondering whether vaccination work new strains. You’re holding oil soaked cloth skin, yeah  Good see greatest country world catching rest world.  develop vaccine. also put place system delivering administering vaccines. delagated state, many poor medical infrastructure. States also must operate within budget. ""plan"" simply Trump avoid responsibility (as usual) real work. began tear reading thought. Finally, fucking finally. here. get arms! I’ll wait. Fine. feel much optimistic there's new WTF beyond pale thing President news every day two. Even he's able really improve things yet, least they've stopped getting worse. I'm still bit worried another coup attempt. Another reason let virus run rampant. longer drawn chance mutations. even insisting vaccine would zero effect effective transmission rate Yeah nah completely shutdown every time there’s even 1 case. staring eternity unable leave state country forced hide every months due 1 covid case, think I’d rather take chances. Nah, dude. according people share sub with. want live mothers basements rest lives never make kids leave again. Also, teachers like wife lazy don’t want classrooms shitty entitled moron kids. made use nice weather December meet people outdoors. understand total isolation. go park beach go walk bike ride. call bullshit!! Bad covid 19 😢😢😢😢😢 E484K mutation Danish/mink strain had?  Actually headline true. doesn’t say “majority people 30s dying,”. doesn’t say specific number people 30s dying. headline pointing that, yes, people 30s dying Covid.

There’s nothing true that. remember: President Trump. President Biden office long enough start affecting......now! Watch mutations though. Here's hoping variants also affected current crop vaccines.  Everybody question don’t agree afraid leave basement: lockdown skeptics idea good night trolling coronavirus daily thread spring? think took while, think I'm point too. Every shot brings us one step closer getting back normal. glad hear! Trueee headline misleading hell. 

If said infected 30 year olds spreading virus sure. herd immunity. happens contain virus. nature log xlogx curves. That's said step gas. However, like physically impossible. Vaccines start help soon. Ramped stay home measures could bend curve enough elimination. will, could close normal April. Instead we'll opt half measures detriment social economic lives. appointment Wednesday. work healthcare I'm one family eligible. reduce risk us, really wish could household basis. wife get sick, knowing I'm vaccinated I'll spiral guilt. God forbid die it'd me. Sure, I'll healthy enough take care her, there's whole hell lot virus treat symptoms ventilation ECMO laying around. Soooo, done then? wasn’t thing recently frigging nuts. wonder many people legit unaware inching closer bars/clubs/restaurants, concerts, theatres, beaches, amusement parks opening 100% without mask requirement.

Umm, unless they've head completely buried sand, think soon vaccinations started distributed administered day coming soon. Lose money stocks yet. worries, one too. Well least removed, idk banned. question long-term viability lockdowns alternate effects go unseen, including country won’t support people financially said lockdown. don’t want compare moral high ground think want pandemic over.  gonna need cool name. 

SAUK great. get job quit 2 hours in. You’ll still get pay stub asking for, least Illinois. people like bully people make feel good. Whatever takes, guess.  logic it’s masks distancing Covid gone. Sorry, hard no. No. wish true. 

Setting goal 1 million vaccinations day. Directing resources defence production act. 

Its small things trump administration didn’t do.   TBH like retail pharmacists. love asking questions medicines I've prescribed. Also love surprising sometimes knowing said drug. Really pharmacists cool. sense legal drug Lord. Lul. think that's highly possible. probably doesn’t know better Huh. results proper leadership... Oh damn love Guy Ritchie movie. probably gotten asymptomatic. confusing virus different impacts people. *stonks. FTFY That's naive perspective China Try telling parents think world stop them. We're Asian...we're good math. 

We probably stats question accuracy tests false positives 😂 US Congrats! Legitimate question cause I've loop: success attributed way Biden administration change, coincidental milestone achieved less month innauguration?  i;d tell shut up. what's point living see eyes look screen never anything look forward too? experts shut one ever listen again. understanding guideline 2 weeks second shot reach 95% efficacy. community spread somehow incredibly high would support continued risk mitigation efforts even vaccinated. community spread low, expect May, hope able live life normalcy. get wrong, I'm open public health officials scientists say it. Lol people believe 🤣 nothing prolonged lockdowns. story young people dying, know relatively rare, accept story instead coming back people percentages? Would situation? 
1. weird, obviously make feel safe
2. person died 100% chance dying. Probably focusing assuring everyone wearing mask wearing properly. That’s area lot businesses could better. Make sure masks covering nose, don’t put piece paper wall, enforce it. 

Keeping people home don’t absolutely come in, distancing can. idea impossible?  There’s reason still works next administration, lying last administration lost including man told Americans drink bleach pediatrician older? used standard advice studies showed reduces effectiveness significantly. older doctors may really kept don’t care much effectiveness (it still provide protection all).

I think generally advice see child responds-if they’re miserable crying feeling bad vaccination give Tylenol. they’re bit tired cranky let thing    cult around guy insane. 

Dude denied effectiveness face masks beginning continued working Trump whole time instead backbone resigning speak dogshit administration. Logistics priorities big deal. How’s boring? think problem. People can’t five minutes. might talk shit internet, least I’m able stand myself. There’s there’s ever been. bored based hospitalizations cases. Maybe allergic something them? can't say I'm particularly interested trying investigate. Exactly I’ve doing. Ans making sure things handled carefully cooking etc. Rinsing fresh food (even tho anyway). earth small profit margins. charge middle class person makes year equivalent dorm room slop food sometimes hundreds people one building. call bs making money theory. Thank God(and even believe guy) Mutations cause imaginable change. Natural selection would tend favor contagious, less lethal mutations. reduce immune response vaccines-am physician Lol. 

I wish. Life boring af.  HE’S STILL IN, I’M STILL Thanks (presumably) downvoting me. many people go “living fear”, it’s me: making sure person take care doesn’t even get chance infected vaccinated. Europe people need stop listening entirely find naive. Businesses ton work present good image. agree that, it’s obvious. somehow cleaning surfaces unconnected that? lot places understand virus spreads, also need stay open know cleaning services make people feel comfortable (that’s secret). It’s also cheaper options. almost seem point yourself. much care limited, much want appear care less limited. Nobody saying vaccines work. Nobody saying great news, really get people view totally black white. bad thing remain cautious. going take years fully vaccinate world. Even US, 200K people could die get fully control. new strains apocalypse, tiny percentage US even received first dose vaccine. time throwing reopening parties, we're rough months. I’m sure that... free testing booths set Bangalore. saw one railway station day. They’re pretty much same, it’s second dose that’s much intense. first dose basically tired little bit rest day sore arm. second shot like legit getting flu minus respiratory stuff. go away relatively quickly  lots issues vaccine distribution administration, vaccine manufacturing actually OK far. CDC data shows 30M doses ready go end December. January climbed 70M. 40M January vs 30M December shows ramping up. still ways go able hit targets (supposed \~200M end March, need ship something like 55m Feb 75M March), definitely room error, companies reaffirmed belief hit targets, cautiously optimistic. think we're closer closer finally ending nightmare. warned thing. point life needs resume leaders realizing means seeing faces public too.  I’m sick vaccine shoppers. Take whatever shot offered first. great news! Tired always hearing negative things. get 20 million vaccinated Biden sworn plan? made fun Biden wearing mask god damn debate. Crazy would interesting. one long time ago growing up. don’t know it’s effected me: usually never catch anything even colds. Maybe (a non-scientific speculation) depends someone’s genetics. Yeah toughed second shot avoid diminishing response seriously sucked. worst pounding headache, deal muscle aches trying focus head killing isn’t easy. Finland already 3x vaccinated vs confirmed cases. like 90s early 2000s, foresee real issues days. called cloud shit scales wide. airports class 2 network connections well. type hysteria completely unhealthy strongly urge stop thinking like this. referring shortage available vaccines shortage production materials?

There’s huge difference think you’re confusing them. Oh gosh awful. Sounds kind similar daughter. started screaming drops burned, doc insisted didn’t. kid sat up, looked me, eyes rolled back floor! ended thinking funny cool story definitely traumatized hope never happens Question, vaccinated trend downward current order vaccine producers ends US already handled stock future? Imagine actually thinking due admin thats less 2 weeks, culmination months work. And? says possible 30s die it. chance may miniscule chance there.

Since one's claiming otherwise I'm sure point is. 10 days created vaccines, put better plans logistics good world?

I get it, Trump moron, Biden make happen magically. mRNA vaccines code antibodies. mRNA vaccines code antigen, covids case spike protein. especially wondering seeing countries they’ll show huge teams PPE spraying streets sidewalks cities, anyone actually gotten covid virus fomites road? dare apologize opening eyes realizing fleeced.

You mad.

Indignant outrage right response hucksters' preying upon us. know many people infected sick (fully asymptomatic) people get tested right time. going either case. It’s happens good leadership mean, it’s true—there’s going back 2019. said, no, hell 2020 cannot go interminably. People fed up. Vaccination MOON 💉 🚀 🚀 🚀 Masks compulsory schools 9th grade shut. pretty much everything open...... since July- August. convene panel meeting order go data vote approval panel members available whenever. J&amp;J (or whoever) also get data ready present regulatory body might perfectly coincide press release. 

probably lot good old fashioned bureaucratic nonsense fucking shit though Yeah, I've seeing comments lot subreddit. like COVID truther people migrated last month. Yes, good news vaccines here, pandemic far over. Even *in* US, tiny percentage Americans actually vaccinated. still horrible situation much country. incredibly gross seeing people essentially mocking anyone wants cautious pandemic far killed 2+ million people. *Identified* cases. actually think bit fat, least type two. fat person is, rather much fat pancreas liver. great restaurants I’m planning going I’m vaccinated so... good fucking food better chance talking Scientologist Scientology

you even _try_ talk anyone anything see. Frankly, looks like trolling.

Also, try /r/selfawarewolves feel like might fit right in.. forgot hot garbage sitting sidewalk summer mornings. best statement read while, eyes ears perked up. Hope, say? still amazes large first world countries relying net importing vaccines.

If say top-50 countries taken initiative develop licence vaccines, built production facilities inoculate home populations would meant quickly would world-wide glut vaccines exported cost across world everybody else.

All top 50 countries could easily afforded question money, question willpower. One days prediction wrong. Cases dropping like lead brick really overestimating new administration's impact short period time. need labels. California :( stories like make want hold mRNA vaccine. Hey remember time previous administration literally funded greenlit vaccine development &amp; production? Yes, body's already poor ability regulate glucose taxed. Also hospitals notorious poor helping patients control glucose hospitalized. sliding scale control carbohydrate heavy meals offered help. Fair enough. speculation point. However, paper speaks affinity mutations. Things could drastically change selective pressure right mutations. really trying “both sides” shit

-

Calm think real argument. always knew could laugh cried, took pandemic teach cry laugh.  took us little 2 months go first vaccine approved reaching point. Imagine we'll 2 months now! Let machine fart good health 👍 Keeping toddler normal life interacting peers cause way developmental damage. That’s 80-90% guarantee vs .01% Covid think human nature someone unhappy feel put lot time right thing waiting, sacrificing make point, receive significantly ""worse"" vaccine others getting. Can't shocked give almost felt less safe testing lobby around others waiting tested go grocery store asked U.S. Food Drug Administration permission fill Covid-19 vaccine vials five additional doses **to ease bottleneck manufacturing**, according person familiar matter.

Filling vials bottleneck manufacturing. stands reason easing bottleneck could increase supply. course, could bottlenecks, know much would increase supply near term. absolute best case 50%, could low 0%. Diabetes alone like 1-2 billion? visitors

Which complete disgusting travesty. Seniors live life isolation already plenty well established science showing isolation correlates early death. Making impossible family visit one many atrocities we've committed last 10 months.

I live next several old folks homes breaks heart thinking people forced live last years life completely cut outside contact. cant fire someone getting vaccinated non-fully approved vaccine. Canada ordered 20M doses Pfizer vaccine August 5th ordered additional 20M around Jan. 12th.  
Right know Pfizer contract says need deliver 4M doses Canada Q1. know Moderna/Pfizer deliver 20M doses Canada Q2 know many Pfizer many Moderna. also know Pfizer deliver 40M doses Canada end summer. know specifics rollout Q2 Q3. Ikr, first u need **own** home really make worth investing home-based services anyways. 

BTW- saved enough making espresso drinks home buy + hold AMC I'm saying *don't* shut restaurants concerts flu. saying do? definitely mandatory environments unless fully approved. What’s end game here? they’re trying prove? point, there’s nearly 100 million received vaccine worldwide. Let’s assume actually died (she didn’t, clear here). One death millions statistically insignificant you’re trying prove vaccine dangerous. People still day, wonder still got disease. went like 4 months sanitizing groceries letting cardboard sit garage 3 days, eventually gave it.

I sanitize hands leaving grocery store, come home, put stuff away, wash hands. keep rolling average steady throughout snowstorm, I'll satisfied. Hopefully explodes afterwards. countries sceptical Russ Federation developed vaccine tested fully. Moscovia pushing vaccine heavily trying achieve political gains it. love see data showing outside transmission thing new variants.

I'd argue also easy hold breath seconds pass someone unexpectedly. I'm incredibly cautious, also admit wearing mask 24/7 comfortable. I'm walk, keep kn95 back pocket. I'm going populated area, throw on. Otherwise, keep distance. data shows airflow, surrounding volume air, sunlight blunt ability virus spread. coupled fact duration exposure walking past someone negligible. pretty safe outdoors holding conversation huddling area people.

&amp;#x200B;

‘*Our study rule outdoor transmission virus. However, among 7324 identified cases China sufficient descriptions, one outdoor outbreak involving two cases occurred village Shangqiu, Henan. 27‐year‐old man conversation outdoors individual returned Wuhan January 25 symptom onset February 1. outbreak involved two cases.’*

*'It difficult study outdoor virus transmission epidemiological analysis transmission events China earlier COVID-19 pandemic found one case outdoor 1 500 20 died covid? I'd like see numbers from. sounds great need 19 million tests month end year. Seems like it’s little late party these. vaccines numbers dropping less tests needed What’s another months?

Two weeks flatten curve. What's two weeks? ELISA test? I’m curious what’s actually can't imagine keeping things shut dumbasses afraid getting tracked Bill Gates whatever.... nobody sympathy 'em. Try real conversation stuff people affected simply positively affected. got laid 6 figure job March, multiple promises brought back terminated along many others.. job market appalling moment. want 15 years experience , MBA better, plus plus plus pay $50k... I've applied hundreds jobs qualified got zero interviews. (For reference last 3 jobs senior management exceptional performance I've progressing career). talk people continued livelihood get work home everyday make money.. lockdown everything, talk people like mooching government etc. can't even conversation anymore live 2 different worlds would absolutely shocked able convince even 50% gen pop get vaccinated.

There zero effort educate public vaccine trust level own. give people idea, 3127 cases reported single day three weeks ago (January 9th). That's also curfew announced.

Monday results typically weekly average, meaning expect back 1000 cases Wednesday. aside, number still right track mean, organizations report data actually operating today? lower numbers centered NE states?

Funny stuff happens across board snowstorm hits. think numbers weird next 2-3 days least. Considering sold millions vaccine many countries including Brazil indonesia think got pretty much covered. Bro competent leadership since shit *started* Washington's phased opening plan (V2, V3?) anything beyond ""phase 2"". Inslee's plan exit strategy. People say ""the pandemic guides us"" BS copout. absolutely reason cannot publicly visible plan includes ""return actual pre-2020 normal"". things there's 96% chance problem planet people around you. eat avocado toast, maybe close 19% chance problem. go Starbucks there's 77% chance problem planet people around you. Keep following orders till masks allowed sent packing. Basically them. chances killing healthy person 20s 30s approaching zero. wouldn’t year anybody would bothered taking shit seriously.  make policy know instead wait conclusive evidence make policy.

They scientists live breathe data somehow decided make public health recommendations without data, inexplicably stuck them. people know work home working home. don’t pretend know true places industries it’s see ones observe. 

I feel like people cleaning stuff generally people businesses don’t function without people visiting person. maybe greedy shut places people would probably lose jobs.  shame headlines like one could scare people vaccine. yet buried article ""Side effects vaccination entirely expected. show immune system mounting response better prepared fight infection body comes contact virus."" agree. I’m skeptical - think it’s important. reality is, number ppl die every day regardless. Covid last month, vaccine. Doesn’t mean either caused it. care they’re heavy numbers that’ll still prevent things open again. don’t want get vaccinated that’s them, won’t hold anything up. People sitting bottoms ordered? agree. actually look forward looking cases vs vaccination daily numbers now. :) fear porn, new variant day, keeps sanity away. They're waiting delicious *I told so* moment never come. negative effects son missing school one entire year extremely low compared negative effects son losing dad forever.

Don't send son school, think what's best him. I'm going stay house nothing whole year, literally time leave house gym, currently online college classes.  yearly, shut restaurants concerts? No, don't.

If saying that, agreement friend. good. motive control people's behavior. get jollies way. care die. That’s dangerous exaggeration. update recommendations based new data responsible way act. want scientists decision-makers updating decisions recommendations data emerge. taken transparent, obvious, narcissistic grifter cares literally nothing nobody else. it, once. Pancreatic inflammation could cause this. work people can't generate immune systems, vaccines rely working immune system. badly, yes


When people “do badly”, raises important question: badly? can’t dismiss failure “well, wrong” majority wrong. better that. find strategy majority actually correctly. then, majority continue wrong people continue die fact.

Design systems people actually behave rather wished behaved. People going going absolutely crazy (in good way change) summer. whole thing started, felt lot people really want bad possible. Almost like internally cheering doomsday news. People refused listen hope, optimism good news. think feeling true then. I'm overrrr thisssssssssss UGGHHHHHHHHHH U.K., gene sequencing test samples constant expect around world similar facilities exist.

Also, hospitals know things get worse better something changed, investigate.  Nobody reads articles anymore even attempts understand something arguing it.

I usually even read comments. make decisions based person's username . look countries did, like Australia, New Zealand South Korea, much restrictive lockdowns short period time, now, long control incoming international cases, things pretty much back normal. huge pride parade South Korea month ago, see pictures?

I feel like reason successful extreme lockdown, short period time. half half lockdown isn’t anything slowing spread making people miserable. pretty comprehensive study 2018 (pre-Covid) investigating viruses including coronaviruses, citing 141 sources basically concludes still know viruses Respiratory viruses transmitted via contact, droplets studies inter-human transmission routes relative importance respiratory virus transmission routes known.

We think studied brand new virus 12 months drawn conclusions figure viruses decades research?

The Lancet article referenced article post tries make case experiments done surface transmission simulate realistic real-world scenarios.

But experiments done airborne transmission vaporized virus airtight drum measured long stayed alive... also completely unrealistic.

I think answer simply know, rather saying know, pretend know make policy decisions. still know. Eh think US fire time Thanksgiving/Christmas wave. you’ve seen mouth breathers usually work nursing homes, you’re probably surprised this. Hope so! would great Haha - exact question days ago got first shot. plans evening involved drinks. Everything saw issue took chances. Inject straight veins! No, seriously. Inject it. want vaccine! Thank you. vaccines fucking medical miracle far concerned. produced vaccine begin distribution within year pandemic fucking incredible. that, efficacy astonishing can't imagine mRNA vaccine hard adapt newer strains (if even comes that). Eh - vaccine works pretty well, least keeping getting hospitalized/killed. LOL yeah...you bubble likeminded people presumes speak whole city...and what’s plan? Stay isolated island forever? BTW...remember everyone wanted help guys whole country fire don’t recall **anyone** smugshits smart live somewhere fire... indicate *at all*?  Therea enough data half dose. given small amount people Britian younger 55. beginning used like now.

Now put away like normally would covid thing. don’t even think twice now. Good call Agreed. trash. Use Instagram keep track friends check tik tok entertainment value Hey mods, y’all pin top? crucially important info. I'm country husband either. son able see 9 months now. feel sure. Let's stay strong ❤️  People shouldn’t shit either. Seriously, think post meant?   wonder much due Northeastern blizzard.

EDIT: due Lmao sitting home , offering par education preaching ""front line worker "" really working flu’s IFR .02%? curious.. I’m 33 yr old female health anxiety high.. can’t stop worrying get I’m done for.. think media’s blame need comparison peace mind. Like bigger risk dying car accident? Gottlieb, guy spinning nonsense doctor income quite time. It’s difference presymptomatic asymptomatic. 

Doctors scientists use words mean specific, different things. 

Everyone else seems understand difference.

Presymptomatic people spread virus. 

Asymptomatic people rarely, ever, do. think anyone entitled getting lost year back?  


Are people suffer years cancer medical treatments entitled getting lost years back?Who gives them? 

Are kids miss school activities, friends, effective learning good grades entitled get back endure years medical problems bad family disruptions? so, gives them?  


A bunch folks town lost stuff massive wildfires. adequately insured, entitled entities paying build new homes buy new stuff. However, renters underinsured folks didn’t get level entitlement; adapt move on. groups lost years living neighborhood homes. Nobody got years back, even folks able rebuild Nearly double sq footage.

When wars happen disrupt/destroy people‘s lives, families, businesses, jobs, trade, etc... none get lost shit back. Nobody gives back them.

COVID19 natural disaster comboed war battlegrounds bodies societies. None us entitled given lost shit back.

How well lost time you. 

This surprise rant I’m really tired modern privilege spoiled many folks. Like, aren’t first humans endure life-altering problems global scale, yo!

Nobody ever entitled perfect life purely self-determined bubble free external disruption. yeh, reported OP misinformation that's premise see end 4-5 years. virus keeps coming back every year, immunity lethal (or according even lethal) extinction level event. Maybe dont test theory public? Ever heard something backfiring? Ugh... new news     Umm say virus mutations circulate throughout world. kid’s school us drop valentines 14 days advance. Filling vials brim what’s Biden help? Maybe 1-2 weeks earlier because, right, competent actually working president much effect speed research. 

However, masks would mandatory Spring instead last week, federal gov't would actively taken leadership role instead ignoring issue spreading disinformation PPE supplies would gone right place instead political allies. CDC would permitted job effectively instead hobbled bombastic, vain useless president.

Short version, probably tens thousands less people would died minimally competent leadership US gov't. guess, imagine would per capita death toll similar Canada’s, would around 170,000 instead +450,000. Still staggering death toll absolute numbers proportionately less. points make sense. thing loses steam, we’re gonna start seeing politicians move opinions well. capitalist society cannot sustained stop flow money. Right?! expecting read grim milestone far vaccines still effective variants, far know. Perhaps less effective however, still effective. submission linking washingtonexaminer.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I've saying weeks. actually people charge actually jobs, thing going ramp faster believe. us vaccinated June, we'll semblance normalcy Christmas.

Start making Thanksgiving plans now.

I'm going Europe July. Well there’s waste time responding person. Indonesia purchased 12 million sinovac vaccine moment.

Idk . Mind article indonesian language. I'm tired ""the worst yet come"" articles. I've hearing phrase like week nearly year. tell I'm precipice disaster every single day ONE YEAR, I'll start believe I'm longer danger. tiresome. needed someone else say feel crazy anti-truth push. Thank don’t know sure helped reducing people getting colds regular old bacteria, guess that’s plus. got first dose Pfizer vaccination today. managed get despite 29 otherwise perfect health volunteer local hospital. 

Glad 10% vaccine far. can't wait get mine! I'm pretty low list. But, open general public, I'm there! Good grief Dude. New papers fuckng companies produce product. want enjoy product pay it. 

Gtfo playing dumb bullshit. know this. Feel better man India produces vaccines countries paid , profit matters (than human lives). 

It's understandable. dog eat dog world, rich prey poor. Snowstorms like don’t usually blanket 95 corridor Philly Boston foot snow middle coordinated vaccine effort end pandemic. 

NYC doesn’t get ton snow. isn’t Buffalo. I'm sorry, goalposts moving. least paying attention.

""Flattening curve"" preventing healthcare system collapsing. saw happen US late last year, families country insisted gathering holidays careless. 

Life go back normal achieve herd immunity. We're long way go that.

Until then, everyone continue practicing social distancing, especially new transmissible variants there. ""Vhere papers?"" article weeks ago interviewed bunch different health professionals asked thought things going get back normal. said never. handrails work destroyed constant cleaning. cleaning rather important maintenance things. There’s always cost. grandmother said thing. says come see outside whatever. doesn’t expect people aren’t high risk struggling make ends meet/ stay healthy quarantine indefinitely try protect her. told quarantines fine garden. It’s mostly younger people privileged work home get everything delivered I’ve seen “holier though/nothing ever opened etc attitudes” Ah sorry hear that; hope recovered well! 18 hours eh? I'm team moderna that.  think definitely will, simply people stop complying they've vaccinated. light end tunnel people, even experts public health officials try shift goalposts, ordinary people going it.

You're entirely right: doctors see things medical standpoint, that's job. entirely respect that. like attitude many seem adopted, prerogative dictate people respond virus rather advise it. case, factors need taken account. Yet many experts spent past year either ignoring bigger picture concerns, commenting though necessary qualifications (they usually don't) times trying silence raised them. That's becomes toxic, view. Lol. worth arguing 15 minutes ago. answered. go running away response. lololol terrible, they're gonna turn lizard people! -My parents probably, they're retired MDs we're sucked local church stupid conspiracy theories. Needless say I'm getting mine secret without knowing. Finally, good news pandemic. ...or many news outlets, including New York Times today, report. like Pfizer saying amount vaccine given 6 people instead 5. issue Moderna vaccine production bottlenecked vial filling process want put vaccine vial. happened maybe twice entire life idea means. someone translate old person? (ok i'm 30 still need translator) PLEASE share reactions vaccine. 

We need area members report parents grandparents reactions shot 1 2, report subreddits 50. 

I’m 68 scheduled first shot end March (unless another comes along sooner) would love hear others age older responded. 

TIA decide share experience. apply US? Since guy Germany.

I'm sure believe though. Variants media's golden goose atm. That's Moderna requesting. requesting increase amount fill per vial. 1). else would watch? Fox News?

CNN actually tries show sides things conservatives like Rick Santorum panel. Fox News still shilling Trump.

That comment Haseltine fear mongering, really said all. take ""decacdes"" overcome Spanish Flue worse pandemic without benefit modern medicine. real worry next coronavirus super flue type thing comes along future live ever connected world. Thank you. Seems affect vaccine efficacy, too.

Narrator: ""They weren't.""

At least superbowl travel isnt bad holiday travel. Still doubt it'll issue though. Phrasing matters too. amount blue-checks Twitter I’ve seen say “We haven’t ruled can’t transmit covid you’ve fully vaccinated, still social distance two weeks second dose.”

I’m sorry, wrong premise. premise “you can’t spread thing you’re fully vaccinated,” disprove THAT. 

Vaccines work make body *immediately* recognize virus attack it. prevents virus replicating spreading throughout body. Viral load especially important covid, default can’t spread you’re fully vaccinated, way around.  Hope speedy recovery! enormously effective stopping death, top that. left wouldn’t able get back again. Take upvote.  Glad know co workers going get fucked near infinite deliveries coming weeks    I’m slow. joke? feel ashamed realize badly overestimated risk. [The average person age thinks catch covid chance actual number 1000x less. media, social media reddit really messed people head up. lack evidence isn’t proof lack knowledge, lack something occurring scientific method defaults isn’t thing; “but could be!” probably worst one I've ever elements zero covid crowd probably disagree title, insane. correct.
Although airborne transfers far likely, surface transfers SARS-COV-2 well documented quite time.

For Example - elevator administration *any* plan vaccination........  Okay including school activity weird, like going get rid chorus now? Whatever makes feel better pal. worth arguing. Really struggling fact spent 10 months diminished social life saw places love go business hear “the worst yet come”. Meanwhile, friends went bars vacations year never got sick. Kick ass. point enough vaccines teachers think overall consensus return classroom point.   That'd nice 99% population horrifying 1% supposed take live culture vaccines boss said day. future. going testing everyday work. posting facebook/instagram constantly, nothing. Husband ""single"" facebook.

Will say thing 6 months? taking break life? got Covid lol Thank explaining stuff.
I'm sure I'm getting voted asking question thread questions oh well. long wife ok I'm good.
Thanks again. She’s 72 low grade fever (99) first night along sore arm 


A good read ""why take billion dollars build vaccine factories"" folks. That's weird... vaccine couple weeks later heart started hurting, like chest gripped. wonder anything vaccine XD spread disease encourage others so. 33% decrease dosage? see data? feel like see conflicting reports every couple weeks. 

Is problem someone *new* cough easily relate something natural / normal therefore dismisses coronavirus? all. average american likely even aware tuskegee experiments begin ""Jewish Aliens"" think valid point immunosuppression organ transplants, etc. Sometimes, people can’t get certain vaccines, don’t work well, it’s reasonable concern. 

In case mRNA vaccines, thankfully, immunosuppressed people good immune response develop antibodies covid. fact, they’re considered high risk group priority vaccination. effective people individuals without immunosuppression. grandma want over? yes, go over. Grandma ain't gonna around much longer okay it, okay too. necessarily ""active ingredient""

they could make millions gallons covid vax equivalent egg whites...

&amp;#x200B;

The US keeps ***millions chickens secret farms make flu vaccines******. eggs work day, hundreds thousands eggs trucked facilities, protected guards multimillion-dollar, government-funded security systems.  eggs breakfast; they're source common flu government invested tens hundreds millions dollars past 15 years ensure enough eggs vaccines. No. Added boring shitty chores minimal impact ge majority jobs isn’t ideal world. Government bailouts work federal government fairly obvious reasons. Unless you’re 65, it’s going fall least.  Dont understand need explain internet lingo days, word like use like slang inherent meaning. news based sure.  I'm violent person, fight since kindergarten I'm 0-1 (that 2nd grader kicked lippy little 5 year old butt), absolutely curb stomp anyone trying block getting vaccinated. need meds, take them. Even reduce effectiveness vaccine get, still lot protected got vaccine. check primary care doctor, tell concern, see advise something. Check get vaccine case need ask others look things up. sure. personally watch follow sports. know thing amongst people. Masks even mandatory now, makes think would mandatory start this? Text? (I'm paywalled) I'd say over, it'll happen much sooner expect. Sure Jan. crazy people get away political comments like yet side it, get banned lol looking information. home health nurse GA. Today found one patients exposed covid paid caregiver comes daily bathes close proximity 8 hours day without mask. caregiver developed symptoms Wednesday still went work, escorted patient Dr appointment Thursday, tested pos Friday. question is, covid related law letting patients Dr office know paid caregiver, patient therefore I'm bound HIPAA, exposed office? office mandates masks, release part consent form let's us talk patients Dr, supervisor said think ""out"" caregiver. want give name address phone number, even info except first name, want tell Dr office caregiver know exposure many days, caregiver office symptomatic. supervisor said thought could get trouble due disabilities act, think fatal pandemic causing virus covered that? Getting close herd immunity? Holiday surge coming end plus fantastic job vaccinations. make vaccine, think heard one thirty times there's vaccine fifteen around somewhere possibly everywhere already, might something it. Vaccines often something viruses. I'm whore vaccine! care put me, want damn thing me!  Winnipeg 17 new cases.  hit 400 peak. 

Province wide 100 people northern remote/reserve communities getting rocked really heard. I'm going stop interacting making claims verifiably false plain nutty. 

A challenge reader inane thread quickly research alternative sources whether evidence side his. Start doctors vs lawyers nonsense work backwards into, uh, doctor vs teacher. 

Have great life dude. know, really watching Dems covid started, seeing going make fuss alternative plan action Trump complete crickets. thing Democrats saying was, ""listen science"" without articulating exactly referring to.

I think US always going disaster due complete lack national healthcare system accompanying lack national control resources pandemic preparation.

Consider Gov Cuomo overseen almost 50% reduction hospital capacity career order make hospitals, businesses America, profitable.  It’s song tune, yet get fine. There’s stopping cases right now. Fact matter is, 300k people got covid single day US. can’t believe I’m saying “light end tunnel way” seeing number drift near 100k day, convincing news something’s working. 

And let’s forget 100k cases aren’t 30k cases last April. Last April US testing sickest sick, checked every box. need covid test everything. jobs require regular weekly testing. 

I’m constant flow bad news, think facts prevail. I’m curious.

How much population needs vaccinated start lowering social distancing restrictions practices?

Right now, makes sense social distance. people 70 years old can’t get vaccine unless frontline workers. say summer gets there’s vaccines people willing take them. anybody get easily.

At point say antivaxxers roll dice? 

Most family process getting vaccinations getting soon comes out. still gonna social distance, it’s time yet social distance.

But make best case everybody wants vaccine received one antivaxxers live choices? fully expect people wear masks form least decade. Maybe even rest years. mandated worn majority? No. WA - case community transmission 10 months. last community transmission April. lock since late april last year.

We imprisoned. I'm cell. I'm house. go shopping. watch TV, work, play games, go exercise. may never get completely back normal, we'll lot closer end year.  No, idiot realize car accident singular incident. 

You're also idiot understand virus works, way comparable car accident. Yes, coronavirus always around. But, vulnerable population immunity (either vaccines natural infection) cause serious problems society anymore. reason masks point. sure people willing continue wearing masks forever.  Misleading headline accurate.

He says people may elect wear masks future abundance caution, required necessary 

Also he’s saying doesn’t think virus ever totally eradicated, likely true sees analogous flu may come back seasonally since don’t know long vaccine immunity lasts. Although I’m kinda ahead one since data I’ve seen immunity likely lasts many, many months guess people adapting behavior. Overall, mask-wearing rates gone time holiday travel season over. could also social distancing actions taken governors mayors. Scroll stories see news vaccine uptake improving cases dropping hard. According idiots Covid supposed disappear election...

They ever admit horrifically stupid reaction pandemic. keep doubling stupid. Point one entire point paper, dude.

Point two, say doctor salaries ""too high"", law school guild - American Bar Association. familiar, yeah? interact whenever commit malpractice.

The average lawyer make PCP. See paper, claim read. sources easily corroborate fact. really dislike misinformation person posted. I'm tired find article, J&amp;J really much less effective vaccines, objectively. 

I'm opting J&amp;J, one shot method. really care wait longer vaccine result preferred one.  J&amp;J I'm comfortable with.  Known cases vs known vaccines. Last checked undercount vaccines factor 8x. doubt lot ""really bad flu"" sometime last year never got reinfected.

When summer rolled around back work + family actually went places (not lot still), never got sick. parents got super sick January suprised covid get fear mongering headline! get fear mongering headline!! case like past 6 months least, it? new this? believe immuno suppressed/compromised people [should take COVID-19 vaccination might provide lower level protection people immunosuppressed immunocompromised compared rest population, still important get vaccinated offer certain amount protection catching COVID-19. important receive two doses vaccine maximise protection vaccination offers   stopping tell see you, aren’t alone, shit situation isn’t lasting forever. I’ve following guidelines along days really hard, today ok day figured would reach out. situation hella unfair, least know right thing community. Keep eyes prize know lots internet randos stand side getting responsibly.  completely agree. miss walking around mall! Grabbing soft pretzel coffee. Here’s hoping summer better!! They're already opening things everywhere. California opened even though 0% ICU capacity LA. guy super reasonable. First he's saying lockdowns could end mid late spring (for UK course), suggesting people might choose wear face coverings crowded public transportation indoor locations future. like asia. big deal. Let try:

The title states cases, really, say confirmed cases.

The number cases US estimated ~1/3rd population, 110M, meaning they've actually vaccinated fraction total cases US.

In reality, fact hit milestone already testament horrible job done testing US population celebration successful vaccinations. good job testing, we'd far milestone.

How do?  Natural immunity+seasonality mostly 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 No. thaw vial keep fridge 30 days. vial punctured used 6 hours. 

Thats right Moderna site. Phizer similar requirements listed. general public get vaccinated summer that'd great. Yeah could get hit asteroid tomorrow. I’m going go around worrying someone going sneeze throat walk outside give covid. Let's compare two totally unrelated numbers!

Good news! Same! Weekends rough, especially stuck inside wind hurts face. bundle face elements sometimes sure would nice just..idk walk around mall her. Go aquarium. Something! realistically can’t western countries. That’s fire hazard. may be. need said true. Whatever happens happens. matter people agree.

Right still hangover previous squad store unpunctured viles 30 days normal fridge .  punctured used within 6 hours


It’s incredible left waste. better standby list people don’t meet current level requirements whole world dying get every shot 


Here Canada vaccines supplies stopped come crawl.  horrible. We'll accept level risk then. tens thousands haredis London.

I assume reason many affected March first wave Britain mostly concentrated London, ultra-orthodox types tend big families attend lot religious services. probably ripped quickly. Also lived downtown denver likely apartment townhouse. Got neighbors hallways Thanks link slight doom spiral. mean Jesus christ. getting prime airtime? Guy assumes come back flu keep lethality every year. Meanwhile Gottleib CNBC, much lesser watched network timeslot scientifically explaining (as technical get cable news show least) unlikely evolve flu type situation ongoing basis. would wonderful, don’t see evident content article (nor seen convincing evidence elsewhere). 

It’s evident vaccine works stop hospitalization serious infection. Whether stops spread next big question.  family needed seek treatment right away. 

The delay medical care exacerbated  disagree.

I think, obviously clue, what's going schools open debate. long term care residents/elderly vaccinated lower death numbers (unless one new infectious variants takes over). Hospitalization ICU admissions may stay high awhile, tend skew 50-70 year age range, age range may immunized months. Oh, sorry. long, rough day everyone. Vaccine not, end pandemic, don’t think people recognize arduous next months be. don’t want vaccine don’t get it. What’s point protesting vaccine opt ?? Best. Season. Ever. Plans probably last year. Sorry. I’m shocked thought news free. suppose depending B could honestly come conclusion. people idea talking about. ""Lockdowns work lock hard enough fantasy world locked hard enough COVID would go away somehow"" Hmmmmmmmmmm  see equating government overreach virus spreading anywhere thread?

Interestingly, fwiw, _other_ comment replying mine, made 2 minutes yours, automoderator removed. probably dick, I'm sorry make assumption.  words, could Thanksgiving Christmas gatherings families without shame.  excited saw respected epidemiologist said get worse new variants. Thoughts? thought vaccines still worked new variants. I'm confused! experts optimistic worried. Someone says going take 4-6 weeks eliminate virus USA living planet. took 3 months freaking Melbourne. Science wasn’t enemy trump office. listened doctors. information coming first wouldn’t chaotic would started correctly. Stay home, that's real trick! Yes doubt we'll done May. Even J&amp;J saying ""could deliver 100 million doses June"". Regardless, even going mRNA vaccines adds couple months onto timeline....the tradeoff robust protection country large could well worth it! won’t mandatory even take precautions. Really people masked world fantasy land everybody focuses lives covid avoidance they’re going sorely disappointed. order them. said nothing holding back using ordering vaccine approved EMA. ever seen lack boundaries gross Kindergarten students personal hygiene? know crammed filled students classrooms are? almost guarantee cashier behind plexiglass (which cashier didnt pay for, teachers would definitely pay want some) isnt elbow elbow five year old cant keep mask well, always personal bubble, doesnt always cover mouth coughing. 

Thank goodness classroom year. loved teaching Kindergarten, gross. caught H1N1 one K students pregnant second literally almost died. people want schools open badly, prioritize vaccines. Eventually it'll become like common cold. People got 2-3 times, severity wane. 

I suppose could go opposite way well, understanding (from asking people smarter am) thats less likely. Listen would rather little bit really good pizza lot ok pizza Population 2022, greater 100% population 2019 accounting regular growth.

If new person born. Population 99% 2019.  intramuscular vaccine, probably want veins :P yet I've right year optimists keep getting egg face  believe you. disagree completely. idea many lives would lost without social distancing? We’ve already surpassed WWII casualties. 

I think implementing policy save lives opposite barbaric. Yes (even approve vaccines)! BC age 30-34 expected get 1st dose August 2nd dose September. sure province probably something similar. 

Either way Canada enough vaccines (80M) September. people would wait October get second dose though. vaccines get approved faster rollout be. Come April Canada getting 1M doses per week 2-5M per week June. Right bottleneck lack supply. Come spring time hopefully provinces used time make sure distribution bottleneck.   Vaccine sign-up error leads phantom appointments Nashville.

The actual Todd initially said appointment website — page SignUpGenius.com — ""not legit"" said agency taking steps shut down. However, Todd later confirmed page actually internal part city's appointment system supposed available eligible residents already navigated city's true vaccine sign page, hosted REDCap, SignUpGenius. Anyone made appointment SignUpGenius website without first using RedCap website reserve actual appointment, even thought appeared had, Todd said. alerted issue Tennessean, Metro Health corrected problem making SignUpGenius page password protected, residents could longer sign without first using REDCap site, Todd said.

Internal Website gone public, caused issues false appointments. think lot common ground here. 

If set “everyone wants mRNA vaccine get it, AZ/J+J lower efficacy vaccines available first come first served basis separately”, I’d totally favor that.

But suspect/fear based current messaging luck draw show appointment... LOL it’s getting toward buzzfeed territory everyone okay it, doesn’t mean it’s okay. Look nazi Germany. Germans supported Nazi party. problem economy aggregate demand, supply limitations due pandemic regulations. Stimulus going fix issue. like revving engine harder car neutral. they'll go work Amazon/FedEx/whoever make money. strategy work. also call vaccines. Call covid prevention inhalers people anti Vax get going vaccinated? would getting test going getting back big deal? hard get area?

Actually, followed authors' advice, would probably reason get tested. much chance tho.  Curevac need temperature requirements Pfizer Moderna. hope phase 3 trials shows good results Denzel Washington &amp; Samuel L Jackson Lots good news, gooder realize. admit live authoritarian nightmare even anti encryption laws passed without opposition, let alone tyrannical nonsense lockdowns. Enjoy company CCP another year country even allow citizens escape prison island. Could theory definitely wouldn’t due massive eu push solidarity. Also didn’t leave Corbyn would likely charge would problems rest eu Well results precautions dont exactly see downside

These mutations mingling. alone alarming. Fused variants anyone? wanting fathom it, doesnt change potentially face Yeah, that's covered statement. care people dying. prevent people dying spreading loved ones vaccinated. don’t open borders year half haven’t started vaccinating yet? Right?

And? what? Taiwan, Vietnam, Australia, NZ closing borders countries imploded yet. Vietnam actually among even positive GDP growth year among sea negatives.

So? What's problem then? Complete sentence.

Well, three countries strong base agriculture part economy food security, may make difference. I'm commenting personal experience. making vials bigger watering down/reducing now? Cause latter seems sus love downward slope worldometer. hope keeps going! number end 2021, would awful folks wanting delay reopening 6 months chases %points vaccine vs. vaccine.  problem see there's lot data missing J&amp;J vaccine. results focus preventing moderate severe disease, also hearing reports people mild COVID-19 end long lung scarring possible long term complications. find info many people mild covid j&amp;j trial whether theyre even looking lungs people. There's knowledge combining vaccines, people choice they're going go one prevent disease occurring first place. try keep updated vaccine news, definitely see benefit j&amp;j, would want family get pfizer moderna vaccine, J&amp;J.

My mums bf diagnosed covid19. Even j&amp;j vaccine disease mild, still potential pass vulnerable like son, young vaccine protection. seems like rolling average starting stabilize level.

Ventilation decent. It’s newer building super small town northern plains. said, it’s little chilly leave windows open able least distance fairly well. measures taken apparently worked, population density sure helps keep transmission down. 

I like spreading shit around normally see school year.

Edit: forgot address online classes. sucks. Sucks us really sucks kids. Whenever start getting rowdy don’t want follow guidelines ask want go distance learning again. eggheads say yes that’s get fuck around. kids really need school save nightmarish home life follow rules pretty well.

The thing worse online kids zoom kids classroom. Fuck that. face mask face shield suggested airlines Immunity begins building around 1-2 weeks first dose continues build reaching plateu around 2-3 weeks. second dose follows similar pattern final full immunity reached weeks. track trace local outbreaks. pretty standard epidemiology. virus hard asymptomatic spread, think doable. r/COVIDVaccinated I'm personally going avoid taking anti-inflammation immune system affecting supplements herbs (that currently take part better prepared got virus also health conditions) days 1st dose week 2nd dose. Afraid things could interfere body's natural response vaccines possibly weakening effectiveness. noticed this. influx upvotes people sudden longer concerned covid.

I'm sure bots what. J&amp;J vaccine becomes available first could take Phiz Mod later added immunity? continue want to, early studies thinking finding trace amounts virus fragments 100x 1000x concentration hour later. finding presence spike RNA tested via rtPCR. tell infectious virion there. Studies tell require attempting culture actually infectious SARS-CoV-2 surfaces, much harder, studies done recover infectious virus. sure. Mexico apparently close approving Russian vaccine think deal went get astrazeneca India.

I don’t want give impression minimize serious nature devastation Covid can’t end society know put generation children behind international competition. Oh sweet summer child. get loss taste covid vaccine. It'll happen sure, downward time. That’s exciting news Within Czech Republic, issues incompetence government underestimated epidemics street pressure ease restrictions PM changing directives ad hock created chaos prevention; social indifference toward protecting others, especially elderly. Czech Republic initially implemented harsh lock population complied, six months later fall outbreak, measures met opposition. lock rules loosened reapplied; infection got wider population, changing course infection. certain segment population see Covid big deal. Czech society became also extremely oblivious indifferent toward death toll. one highest per capita infection rate world, one highest death rate, still create pressure upon government save lives. People care point. Several months ago, models predicted current death toll reach 20,000 spring (currently 16,000) met total disinterest health ministry, country epidemiology centers, medical community. cannot get professionals care, really little average person do. Hell yeah, let's thing MA! Got second Pfizer shot Friday.

Armpit shot still swollen. Worth though. probably case cases falling. Could seasonality cases peaked etc need third world, please :) Money. scheme cost government however many millions reimburse discount, much made extra spending? Businesses unfurloughing employees starters, you’ve got money made food drink sales, it’s half price people would spent ordered expensive meals, there’s revenue taxis public transport people using again, revenue fuel sales people start going cars. we’re meal, may well pop X, Z shop make day it, clothes first time months, new bits home we’ve done up. 

And you’ll wholesale orders restaurants, they’re serving food half price still putting big orders meals cook, boosts industry. businesses making money again, they’re able start paying debts rents bills means landlords see boost. 

If government makes appallingly shite decision best interests average Joe, absolutely guarantee money motivator. 7 day average single doses, full course two doses. 31.8 million doses already given, many doses given person.

I would love optimistic, believe majority American adults, let alone majority Americans, fully vaccinated June 1. Many thanks.

While 20-fold difference WCN nations, I've seen 2-fold difference WCN US States. Regardless, lemme commit sharing graph two US coming 24 hours. really hope thats satire. Truth usually stranger fiction. yet still see articles every day saying new variants cause third wave vaccines may longer effective

I don’t know believe anymore Nothing beat real headline November:

# COVID turned breathing deadly event us potential serial killers  also celebrate Faucidians (mask upon him) every month per r/churchofcovid r/coronaviruscirclejerk council. think India shipping doses countries amazing Myanmar, bangledesh etc ton people size. two combined 200 million people.

I think getting vaccines countries helpful citizens moral people know countries getting would feel better know country least getting started. Also, processed foods, carbs, sugar, high- fructose corn syrup, lactose... many foods. really really aware read labels cane sugar. Mostly family making everything scratch now. persons system get overloaded. Even salad dressings sugar them. People forget things like this. Ketchup. Sauces. Drinks. Breads. Perfect storm causing new diabetes cases. Stay home, eat food, exercise... know it... That’s arbitrary income amount factor opportunity cost obtain education, hours worked get income (let alone scope work).

RN’s Primary’s Care Physicians much underpaid. Sure. none remotely worth locking indefinitely.  Fucking BASED Give tourism income excuse travel abroad? answer simple. getting kids school priority, vaccinating teachers well. reopening school buildings truly critical people claim (and teacher agree is), teachers first round vaccines. absolutely feel safe sitting room 30 kids time, cases 200 kids class day. hate online learning too, want know going die end health consequences that, poor health benefits many states, leave us physically destroyed buried mountains medical debt. want schools open, needs increased demand vaccinate teachers. currently one teachers want class. experienced fall quit job moved district virtual experience awful. get shots arm, immediately supportive reopening building welcoming back however many kids may come. Sure would ideal eradicate it. means hard lockdown millions jobs lost trillions debt think would political make happen death toll zero. Again, younger population shit like nothing cases (in fact, younger population means cases) deaths death rate.

Again, peer reviewed studies look transmission controlled sanitized environment. studies look real world effectiveness masks. incorrect serve little purpose talking use masks local Walmart outdoors. Yeah! also crazy pack bottles 5 doses accepting maybe 10-30% drug wasted how’s ventilation? letting keep classroom windows open? students complaining it’s cold (being January that) I’m thinking myself, better cold dead. don’t like windows open, go back online classes. still REALLY expensive isopropyl alcohol bought back April. contamination

viral mRNA, infectious virus.

you get positive hit incredibly small amount fragments viruses. level detect trace amounts remains SARS-CoV-2 pretty much science-fiction level good.

figuring infect much difficult process (and requires BSL-4 lab successful actually cultured grown infectious SARS-CoV-2) tests turned infectious virus spread surfaces. hope so. Honestly charge id lift restrictions mandates say heck experts didn't;t like I'd tell quit say business run whole economies hands. Mission accomplished? Well clearly British would already known this. able get amount doses faster. say rain didn’t impact activities. non orthodox population getting vaccinated pretty fast ( I, example, got vaccinated last week second dose already I'm 30yo teacher). general population cooperative even FB group dedicated announcing leftover vaccines found people get vaccine wasted.
The orthodox jews getting vaccinated fast be. lot suspicion towards vaccines general (last year measles outbreak). 
In meantime, hospitalization orthodox jews, jusy old people, going people received vaccine yet. guess funeral cause another outbreak. mean polio eradicated, world open, must right level. However, feel like smarter dumber strategies could pursue. Get front page! Remember doctor's video clean groceries. almost gave whole thing right then. restriction though. Unlike UK, EU let’s vaccines exported. Actions mean words crisis like this. People don’t stop dying give IP. far, nothing British propaganda. attendance capped 30,000. Why? deadly pathogen loose. safe, would cap it. unnecessary risk high potential cost. good thing know attended masses overseas visitors. That's plus. reddit recall. acknowledge significant demographic difference, brought up.

There demographic difference entirely explain wide 5 6 fold difference mortality rates &lt;60 years developed developing nations:

It seems combination higher infection rates, poor hospital care higher rates pre-existing comorbidities Middle Aged especially Young Adults developing countries.

From Chauvin, Fowler &amp; Herrera show COVID-19 mortality age gap ***is explained younger susceptible populations developing countries.***  ***we provide indirect evidence higher infection rates play role***, showing variables linked faster COVID-19 spread residential crowding labor informality correlated younger mortality age profiles across cities.  show lower recovery rates developing countries account nearly higher death shares among young adults, almost half higher death shares among middle-aged adults.  evidence suggests lower recovery rates developing countries driven higher prevalence preexisting conditions linked severe COVID-19 complications, limited access hospitals intensive care units countries.

Chauvin, J.P., Fowler, A. Herrera L., N. 2020. *The Younger Age Profile COVID-19 Deaths Developing Countries*, IDB. someone gets shots covid vaccine, long take immunity take effect? heard reports Israel, West Virginia. Basically alternate list, cancellations extra doses end day whatever reason, put word immediate area anyone show within 2 hours gets it.

It common sense course makes uncommon. Cuomo fining places $1 million deviate prescribed order, one doctor Texas arrested took vial reportedly going go waste. much attention wrong things enough attention right things. Great turn around say look vaccines dont work 😣 convinced much anti-vax campaign, particularly covid19, promoted outside actors America's best interests minds, well idiots parot them.


This one sciences greatest achievements least half century. pat back.

Anti-vaxers sudden beleive every vaccine side effect story, still beleive stories bad actual disease be. Delusion within delusion. Elevated blood glucose levels also common among taking dexamethasone, steroid front-line treatment COVID-19.

I felt interesting sentence article. time many people news said would take years vaccines developed shut downs last March would last least year, came be. agree one knows sure. uncharted territory. Yet know people go crowded bars/clubs every weekend eat almost every day without mask yet still got it. get it. taking piss?
 expect worst never disappointed! ;) “I need covid test, and, it’s negative, condom bag Doritos.” Keep mind efficacy younger group 92% mixed group 62% support theory works ages. immunological data enough judge efficacy need phase 3. took president took virus seriously we're going need rethink entire pandemic response strategy. Lockdowns don’t work people don’t want work.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Honestly, soooo wish efficacy higher. like tech behind vaccine. think lower limit efficacy

That's two full dose regiment. higher figures include unfortunate 1,5 doses. UK authorities stated 90% efficacy hold miscalculation attributable something else. mean approved 62% efficacy regiment really messy, actually outrageous given experienced scientists behind it.

I soooo confused. would use vector doses. using chimpanzee adenovirus proves aware fact immunity vectors issue... use vector second time around... possible think likely result parallel selection. kind recombination events co-infected cells thought less common corona viruses prevalence SA Brazilian variants probably still quite low UK. else going handle deportations customs? Bro, researched hours YouTube Facebook, fire trucks won’t get faster, matter do. care pour gasoline houses?

-	you, apparently  Bingo. it’s excellent vaccines become gold standard production stabilizes. others simply aren’t good enough long term. really think Americans gonna ""lock down"" near cusp spring, they're treat. Sooner later everyone regardless background getting still waiting game like now. know it, you’ll hear state, city, county, town ready go anyone (except little kids) get vaccine. doses body, it’s another waiting game rest state nation get somewhat stuff freely again, perhaps depending people are, won’t second waiting game people things boldly. Archbishop Canterbury, Justin Welby, said Twitter EU focussed control export vaccines undercuts EU’s basic ethics,” said. “They need work together others.” [That’s true.

Another day, another morning morning shows saying variants cause us great suffering next months Nah, they'll still come in, people roll eyes more. Water Teachers first likely. Western nations really look approving this.  Biden said wants 100 million vaccinated first 100 days office, currently 1.34 million day think surpass goal. noted 900k day inaugurated roughly 67% increase 2 weeks still good see Probably gonna watch Europe, too. Gonna late. soon approved relevant European agency

It happen. EMA extremely slow approve anything, even vaccines produced european companies, without political implications slander involving russian product, would usually take weeks, almost month point application filed. happen yet russian vaccine.

Any country wanting use vaccine Hungary go alone emergency procedures. polite way refusing shifting responsibility elsewhere. OP joking getting covid get immunity common cold safest way avoid cold. :) Yeah know intention apply European market, think announced anything regards US market personally see it, rather focusing others.

Maybe bit like calculus “discovered” one person worked independently. 

It always “found.”  single-use articles cleaned reused? airlifted hospital helicopter. pretty serious condition Actually mechanism action similar. Instead lipid nanoparticle use virus get genetic information inside cells. know I'm glad, I'm UK, (weirdly) find proud governments actions. say think VdL clearly deflecting European media hitting hard (rightly) - read full interview Le Monde paywalled it.

What I'm finding silly lot threads idea completing standard approval emergency approval EU automatically wrong. UK EU balance (different) risks making decisions, I'm saying either right wrong- using 'they came conclusion' argument EU's decision simplistic. LOL!! Selfish??!!

USA bought enough mRNA vaccines cover entire adult population country. doses people use, for? 

It's OK want get J&amp;J vaccine OK people choose pass one get mRNA one instead. enough. selfish get something allows live normal life again, alternative option continue masking, gloving, avoiding people effectiveness significantly lower. People want feel safe again. travel again. go crowds again.  ""per capita"" operative phrase here. I'm going wade argument 1918 objectively worse this. Spoiler alert always die end. instructions unclear, applied directly forehead good enough Germany good enough world.  ""almost die"" dude. Best medical care world.  plan handle differing opinions level precautions take within households year? 

Should whole family staying home accommodate cautious people, fine disagree/do risk assessment maybe take precautions home want extra protection? Good question. Could truly delay ""we need days verify *can* export doses."" could also form pushback AZ deliveries. know Japan ordered AZ doses. 2 government wasn’t tracking first year pandemic. great news world. Even don’t trust Russia China, hopefully efficacy good vaccines. need every country reach high level immunity order end pandemic. can’t Europe North American immune rest world still struggling. seem happening. information trusted? Whats UK variant avoiding immune response, fear mongering? give AstraZeneca pass reason.

I think Oxford name behind it. truly made mess Imagine another vaccine efficacy 62%. would much outrage.

I think lower limit efficacy. measure efficacy via PCR instead symptoms, stats really messy, actually outrageous given experienced scientists behind it. Oh gosh miss theaters much! Another zero decimal? mean like 00.2% instead 0.2%? Lol So, article *you* linked discusses people getting infected vaccination could theory transmit others, didn’t study specifically rush get vaccine approved. article linked support assertions.

And take lack looking specific thing proof doesn’t exist??

I would say might want reread article linked, 538 business trying dabble medical discussions. 

People getting infected vaccination, most, severity illness greatly decreased, illness still caused active replication virus within body. nothing mechanism vaccine would make virus formed vaccinated body inert. virus sheds potentially infectious.m  mentioned America. I'm talking democratic country free press independent institutions.

Do think they're different Russia?

How many opposition leaders assassinated Ireland? many journalists murdered Sweden?

How many opposition leaders currently jail Germany? Organ damage, brain fog, psychosis, diabetes, heart failure, kidney failure, more. list endless happen later without strong initial response immune system. Enjoy dealing country gives zero shits someone can't work. AstraZeneca trials see whether vaccine compatible one Gamalaya boost efficacy availability?

I heard anything trial yet since announcement, anyone information? one dose two dose vaccine? curious this, though others might also:

* Sputnik 1, first artificial satellite go orbit, launched 4 October 1957
* Sputnik 2, first spacecraft carry living animal (the dog Laika) orbit, launched 3 November 1957
* Sputnik 3, research satellite launched 15 May 1958
* Sputnik 4, crashed Manitowoc, Wisconsin Sputnik 4 actually Korabl-Sputnik 4 according Another mutation UK? Haha

The reason UK ones finding mutations performing huge amounts genome mapping test for/find them, unlike many nations. identified 55% mutations global shared database, I'd pretty confident betting house UK responsible 55% world's mutations. interesting alcohol consumption fallen almost nothing (it high start) pot smoking increased.

A lot alcohol cheers minutes only... Lockdowns persist 2022 though. People fed up. Good luck making people pay price politicians' incompetence. Actually, Europeans expressed openness approving Sputnik V EU. remember reading headline stated Merkel encouraging Russians work EMA help guide process.

The fact Gamaleya institute working AstraZeneca combining two vaccines also encouraging sign eventhough UK member EU. EMA approved AstraZeneca's vaccine all, collaboration significant. I’m sure made US. Find way get done. meanwhile german breweries sold 14% less beer germans. \*cheers  also dying.. don’t get look back.  widely promoted let many possible. enforce 2 weeks isolation let virus marinate. Big boost gene pool. months people talking “PeRmAnEnT dAmAgE,” haven’t seen single peer-reviewed, non-anecdotal, scientific study suggests type permanent even truly long-term damage COVID, especially among people mild asymptomatic cases. 

The whole blood clot thing bit worrisome specifically since I’m hormonal birth control slightly heightens risk developing clots, seems happening small percentage people recently recovered treatable. again, I’ve really seen anecdotes. it’s risk I’m willing take. slows down, matter much.

That's articles ""this 20yo guy happy life got long covid he's plant"" start. One shot per mutation? Gonna turn y'all Big Pharma pin cushion rate. people fat diabetic expect live months longer, since that's generally considered quickly terminal ailment. people even think they're worthwhile humans deserve live! added megacomment yesterday! approve single shot now? sign desperation, adding another vaccine works. sounds like J&amp;J much stockpile sitting around anyway. think so. wording firmly implies UK irresponsible. great take. Excellent news, especially developing countries like mine probably never see Pfizer/Moderna's vaccines.

For people still ""Russia vaccine bad, western vaccine good"" even independent test reviews, guess there's hope anymore... There's excuse EU approve vaccine take 100M doses June Gamaleya offered. Approving buying 100M doses Sputnik make us dependent AstraZeneca vaccine, data strong vaccines fucking EU delays.

Buying 100M doses get herd immunity June. vaccine companies hit supply deadlines, US enough doses everyone June. mean pandemic suddenly see well ramp vaccination sites goes actually get vaccines people vaccine takes time become effective. definitely good milestone watch, mark end. Wow. ton empathy teachers vaccinated needing teach person.

When vaccinated, empathy gone. would kill vaccine right work without worrying catching virus.

What else want? please compare Germany mororn murderers outright refuse buy vaccines western countries US evil wants control destroy them, important! 

I'm saying guys problems, actually - really dissapointing see even place like Germany struggling this, god behind laughable. begging gov BUY vaccines months, we're called traitors it. 

They ended buying Sputnik V vaccines, even health officials inside country saying getting vaccine. lol 

So started making vaccine, testing 37 people far sure it, they're gonna start mass vaccination starting March. like WTF. I’m surprised it’s Putin vaccine I’d willing take precautions home like wearing masks common areas eating separate times we’re close contact room.

Archbishop Canterbury Irish? That’s odd.... Imagine thirsty That's valid point think given strong immunological data chances vaccine negligible impact extremely low. 

AZ conduct phase 3 trials, issue simply enough older adults control group infected covid. nothing suggest data I've seen suggest efficacy levels would low. lack results highlighted MHRA authorised based results within age groups safety data.

In cost/benefit situation way justify providing AZ vaccine older adults makes sense able quickly provide enough vaccine another manufacturer. English second language too.

We play along else CIA and, sometimes, IMF get upset start fuckery  God, breaks fucking heart. :-/ wonder way shot might actually used US? makes zero sense me. fall anybody wants vaccine US able get one.

Why keep schools closed past that. COVID literally less dangerous flu children Teachers vaccinated risk? original post focuses US only.

Probably cheap enough. Cough, cough Nalvany North Stream. 

But, think vaccines come strings attached receiving countries? articles Europe complaining vaccine debacle hurting EU soft power international stance. Chile getting Sinovac (4+6 million doses). Curiously electricity firm sold Chinese, lol. choice have? ah.. 50k Pfizer doses.... sigh. Group 4, Wales. Would need perfect compliance though? would stop-gap measure young, healthy people vaccinated countries time critical summer concert season. Reducing spread 80% would probably enough avoid huge spikes.

It's obviously difficult balancing act. I'm inclined allow outdoor concerts limited crowds allow artists organisers chance survive. get vaccinated chances getting virus something like 1 10,000. really risk keep us home businesses shut down?

See edit quote. assume that's meant say. not, disregard.

This data actually practically non-existent. sparse 95% confidence interval includes possibility vaccine causes COVID. [See Table (-51.5%, 100%) Dose 1 Dose 2.


Is data regarding symptomatic cases better use infer hospitalizations/severe cases? Yes. data Israel also solid stuff? Yes.

They monolith, midway vaccination fine teach person, hope students safe it. Many unions smaller scale responsive everyday teacher concerns, ""let's never return"" BS. idea return safely, teachers vaccinated, definitely happen.  they've got vaccine volume, might, think it.. took quick look..

In England only, 200+ hubs based hospitals, 1200 vaccination sites running them, 50 mass vaccination locations sportsgrounds etc, they're adding big pharmacies this, I've even seen they're fitting supermarket pharmacies, converting clothing sections closed moment

There even training non qualified staff start got data people, via NHS, stocked supply chain items since March last year, they've got range vaccine, home brewed imported..

and given 600k peak two days ago, that's 1% adult population.. 3 months away start May - unless supply chain stuffs up, think it. live Florida. never state mask mandate “lockdown” open worthless. businesses opened 100% awhile ago, vast majority us carry like nothing happening. 

No one living government restrictions here—quite opposite—and yet it’s still fun. Why?

It’s fun sickness death. virus itself, nothing else. 

Things like formerly healthy coworker seeing cardiologist thanks mild infection. kind random thing nothing restrictions government. 

It’s ths virus.  purchasing more. Trump passed obtaining doses least twice. Biden pushing purchase additional 200m now. already happened previous administration. purchased enough country could help rest world. Instead Trump even purchase enough. 

That's pretty major difference. put mask stay away people. I've made point fellow countrymen posting well proven it.

I know small minority selfish ignorant, stereotype validated world post here. Eh course. one powerful enough beat final boss, course beat normal enemies. say conservative. lot leftist friends use it. I, one, waiting see President (Tim) Biden say issue Ditto. Soon enough! think pandemic good all. also look introverted and/or people anxiety issues perspective. similar issues.

But can't defend anyone WANTS pandemic continue selfish reasons. That's bad anti-maskers anti-vaxxers refuse whats best community. death rate higher UK previously officials said new variant deadly. right, 

Even see slander happening ""european"" products, Macron come suggested AZ vaccine ""quasi ineffective"", Respected German newspaper HandelsBlatt spread misinformation AZ vaccine 8% efficacious 65s (turns got confused difference efficacy percentage people 65 took vaccine) Von Der Leyen accusing UK compromising vaccine safety even today. distract mounting anger EU procurement process cut supply astrazeneca 

There way face comments EU would smoothly quickly endorse Sputnik, despite offer Gamaleya mounting demand Germany et al, even data clear strong efficacious vaccine. likely hear smear campaigns. Supply likely booked elsewhere time EMA authorization granted, especially rolling review undertaken. 

I beleive correct individual member states Hungary, Serbia etc go shopping individually endorse individually want time soon. would imply UK pass criteria, they're approving AstraZeneca's vaccine based UK trials. article pre-print peer reviewed.

That count Covid.  I'm really saying bad, think testing revolution, especially coronavirus wanes. general, think we'll look back testing efforts say ""this helped"".

I'm convenience, think lack convenience reason Test &amp; Trace failed. Well, according source, they’d let go 62% clinical workforce, pandemic, staffing shortages already problem prior pandemic.

Okay buddy. 2020 ""healthiest"" year. Sorry say, Joe Biden Win. Trump vaccines decline Christmas New Years.

Christmas + New Years inevitably going spike cases month January decline infection periods.

The million vaccines day already happening Trump, Joe's Mask Mandate going work quickly would believe. numbers reflect this? Increases doses given steady regardless President. elementary schools least, personally think really depends location vaccination staff broader community. Plenty areas gone in-person learning outsized impact community spread. expect teachers staff vaccinated - really spring early summer - surrounding community vulnerable adults strong vaccine uptake, good reason delay in-person schooling.

Can kids still get disease? Yes. pretty much evidence we've seen thus far, they're extremely likely shrug days lasting impacts (yes, know MIS-C, extremely rare) biggest impact community level vectors spreading it. community large decent protection, impact greatly lessened. Festivals axed, mostly big ones. Pandemic June. That’s profession. see think that, means one medical condition simultaneously.

The root ""morbid"" means ""disease."" require death. know someone isn’t going leave complete isolation kids vaccinated. can’t fathom it. know huge socioeconomic component dying covid. Cooks likely uninsured, undocumented, people color living poverty line, etc. logic heterologous prime Boost AZ/Sputnik would help out, boost vector harder manafacture prime Gamaleya's. 

Ad5 harder manufacture?? I'll definitely need source that. unfair say vaccine manufacturers benefit equally collaboration. mission improve efficacy AZ's vaccine. data soon Lancet

What specifically? expect overall similar protection two doses, AZ using 12 weeks (89% AZ, 91% Sputnik something like that) 

Well that's speculation wait 12 weeks order get second dose opposed 3 Sputnik V huge difference. AZ's efficacy 62% two doses they're administered now. That's main regiment testing Phase III clinical trials. is. useful preventing severe symptoms, absolutely fair say Sputnik V efficacious vaccine. AZ's advantages Sputnik V, hand. fair admit that.

Idk US approve, yeah, see happening.

FDA wouldnt since need way ascertain data genuine monitored and/or auditable. 

This reason FDA considers authorization based mostly US trials. Quality trial conduction data collection poor places regular monitoring, ethics boards audits carried out. Supply one thing. logistics behind distribution another. second venue, leadership much matters policy matters; coordination feds states matters. nearly complete show feds came ppe, respirators like mattered, lot. competent leadership direction going matter quite bit. Every country afford produce vaccine home rightly investing ability. great news. vaccines needed, less countries monopoly help prevent ""vaccine inability produce COVID-19 vaccines home left country mercy foreign governments, could time slam doors shut vaccine exports people vaccinated.
That risk became ever real week Europe's new export controls vaccines take hold, putting risk Canada's entire supply COVID-19 vaccines.


The eu seems spooked less everyone. Good news everyone tbh. countries EU actually want Sputnik V vaccine they've offered 100M doses less $10 dose...they reason buy them, especially AstraZeneca shortages

The US definitely able vaccinate 80% adult population May... Russian med tech actually usually pretty good, trust comes vaccine. You’re living different reality rest world. realize we’re blaming government right? You’re blaming locking down, I’m blaming supplying necessary aid help businesses.

At end day, person loses job stays unemployment continue wake up, breathe future opportunities find lines work.

The people would died would privilege. It’s selfish prioritize money human life. succeed? No, bunch stupid people mad easily manipulated get way, cares! give credence actions acting like ever real opportunity make difference. Politicians send dick pics random women, mean US democratic system collapsing politicians dirty things? Let's forget country went attempted coup early years union, civil war, two world wars 3 wars majority country agree yet are. Everyone still standing everyone moved trump, even fox news. vaccine clearly works 60s

Probably, data lacking, nations dont give elderly moment (until data there).

Makes sense. think nailed it. mentioned DHS shitty reaction Bush 911 like mask police now. lame. also, people keep claiming lockdowns lead reopening faster, not, experience. Lockdowns lead lockdowns, reopening leads reopening. observed living San Francisco (lockdowns lead lockdowns) Atlanta (reopened stayed open). Turns bullshit apparently common sense beats high school diploma. I’m shocked wasn’t mu cm preparation vaccine came nowhere addition that, amount fat shaming justification people's deaths overweight irritates beyond belief. addition African American Hispanic populations getting hit hard virus many derogatory comments regard. Despite notion everyone supposedly free thinking accepting walks life, pandemic shone bright spotlight fact hiding hate anger people years, addressing it.

If pandemic opened everyone's eyes fundamental issues government society, know will.

But I'm babbling now... 660,000 people die year heart disease ban poor foods, 173,000 people die year accidents force people stay home, 50,000 people year die self harm prioritize mental health. (Even though should)

in total almost 3,000,000 Americans die every year.

This comparing WW2 getting stupidly hand. Nobody cares 3 million deaths year.

Why COVID much different. expect Fauci good actor, expect good immunologists even doctors?

Why authorities you? knowledge subject me. I’m feeling pretty cynical things CA. Silicon Valley, Kaiser cancelled 5,000 vaccine appointments didn’t enough doses administer. Meanwhile, Newsom loosening restrictions CA small dip cases he’s pressure recall parties pissed him. one largest portions UK variant. Throw fact Biden basically starting 20 points 4th quarter thanks Trump, it’s feeling like won’t March 2022. I've read, side effects even much. oral typhoid vaccine pretty bad side effects, least it. covid vaccine nothing.  Yeah, alone thinking would fucking awesome get sputnik vaccine people ask got Pfizer Moderna, say “no actually got Sputnik V” studies hospitalized patients. sick enough admitted hospital illness could cause thing. Fatigue? Obviously. 25% recovered patients walking shorter distance average six minutes? patients obese, would make likely hospitalized COVID first place, can’t walk fast non-obese people? Depression anxiety listed lasting symptoms one studies. without COVID lol. None scary people trying make things be. May Rest Peace. inspiration. source that? That's great! vaccines shows enough efficacy sooner reach end shitty tunnel. opinion unfortunately downvoted en masse sub. sub toxic last year. May Rest Peace. inspiration. Vaccine manufacturing prone lots delays setbacks. tried ramp early didn’t quite get people keep misrepresenting news. bad news that's spun good Pfizer PR team. We're getting less doses need all.  cannot become positive vaccine itself. person caught regular COVID vaccine full affect one small percentage people get COVID vaccine. know really understanding? know 40 younger, chances dying COVID low. *aren't* zero, obvious COVID long-haulers impact health rest lives. 

And 93% people kill, 55 older?

Does leave society two choices: simply take hit let 55 die 40 inconvenienced (I'm reminded Logan's Run here) - generations medical professionals live PTSD? vaccine, leave place common restrictions lift population vaccinated? way UK seems right, is, prioritize age groups. already said, convince there. 

Sure problems least prevent biggest problem, problem everybody prevent year now. practice works way works 75 year olds (you pick Internet service telephone number tell service there).

Whatever system, problems. going work perfecly even countries things tend work well. way UK it, making risks smaller probably better anybody else. would highly recommend it. check least every week keep pulse following daily/hourly basis exhausting. problem family. 90 year old grandmother wants family come see lonely, also digging heels getting vaccinated stories long lines, doesn’t want “be pain” doctors office trying schedule appointment. also unfortunately plugged really trumped news sources, thinks vaccines taken South Americans flying country get shot. insufferable person hoping never ends always looking bad news think statistics known, that's conversation i'm having. still 1.35? thought gonna reach 2mil point health impacted politics. article Journal American Medical Association shows President Trump's social media posts influenced attitudes towards COVID-19 turn public health implications. Let's forget besides factors extremely stressful job relative industry whole, line cooks overworked management, line cooks minimal sick leave, line cooks drink, smoke, drugs excess.

The ""commercial"" restaurant industry pretty horrible. I've worked two chefs basically think live see 60 I've worked lot people who're basically running adrenaline coke regular basis.

That's find hard sympathize industry regards what's going COVID. empathize BOH people need money small, family run businesses who're suffering right now, zero sympathy exploitative management, FOH staff get tipped hundreds dollars night standing around looking phones goofing off, yuppie/hipster foodies who're bitching moaning places go get pictures Instagram accounts. need be, I’ve yet see compelling metric says we’d need booster currently circulating variant. sad. ""The Health Ministry confirmed 31 new Covid-19 infections Tuesday evening, including 30 domestic cases ongoing outbreak.

30 evening + 1 morning = 31 local cases 2/2. Daily local case count wave 5 98 62 61 31 32 31. Chí Linh city total lockdown. There's case vaccinated person gets positive mild symptoms infect another person severe decease hospital medication. I'm saying vaccines bad but, vaccinated people responsible regulated got first jab think already immortal. anti lockdown start could see forest trees. virus wouldn’t kill everyone people left behind would everything live decimated restrictions government boots necks. 

I right. sucks. didn’t want right. are. called every name book: murderer, heartless, denialist. We’ve murdered people weren’t risk virus, we’ve heartless people lost everything people don’t see denialists themselves. Simple that. ICU capacity super good right now, last wave added hundred temporary ICU spots never used, therefore removed. back far max capacity I've heard Floridians, seem lot ""normal"" time rest US, let alone rest world. can't take opinion general whole state.

And again, I'm protesting mask mandates, maybe Florida one order lower deaths infection, maybe would ""fun"". Turn into? think I've last week? mean many studies done this. School safe community spread down. community spread high it’s probably safe especially teachers vaccinated. think teachers hold long possible think clear point go back community spread low vaccinated. say “President (Joe) Biden”? tf else would be? talk J&amp;J able manufacture doses June—were one companies making shitton vaccines approval? thought big part operation warp speed millions doses ready go, even meant risking wouldn’t pan long run. Something something something can’t trust Russian vaccine put fuckin vodka tanks shit mention social distancing impossible situation. constantly pass within foot another person. respect incredible money raised family go Barbados pandemic. wrong probably decision go can't help feel death influenced trip Military Myanmar grateful donations. like immensely. thought too- seems like West bought supplies vaccines, hopefully developing world get vaccinated faster. Lmao see comment like Based know data don’t think public policy wise it’s necessary children vaccinated safely reopen schools someway. something directly related unrelated? get comment.

This Plague, Inc. unlock new feature instantly transforms viruses/bacteria/etc across entire planet new feature.

Obviously old B117 still exists going spread around, new ""sub variant"" (my term) E484K mutation. 200 trillion dollars, use money speed production distribution vaccines. 

And buy new house. need reminded this? worried might hate Pfizer less? maybe I'll feel good we'll doses hand sooner? What's goal reminder? mean make joke OK.

All want people financially ruined. obvious matter say government care, fuck open everything. want us shut down, make worth it. guys seriously coming around this? Better late never guess.

Afaik admitting patients deemed weak survive moved treated ICU unit. know cases people calling individual hospitals decisions made around ICU vs ICU, rememember investigation saying would systemic thing.

I also doubt countries moving people ICU matter condition, idk.

Kind makes whole article bit pointless, hard know helped reduce increase death rates. afraid allergies, probably stop trying new foods.

You never know *might* allergic. Can't careful know. thought Reddit loves Russia obsessed Soviet Union though. watching Chernobyl taught anything metallic tastes mean got radiation poisoning. Chinese vaccine bad :D Jesus thats awful. Im sorry. really think banning alcohol outright I'd sober several years lockdowns. 

Old habits die hard. told Florida total disaster people going there? don’t work field. someone actually works biochemistry, would extremely unlikely variant arise unaffected current vaccines. would essentially variant completely new virus.  [Relevant clue OP was, make wrong.

You clearly understand. government care. We've begging assistance best may get another 2 grand. course want assistance, I'm dumb enough think they'll actually anything, I'm realistic...and know too, believing anything else pie sky blind hope. wake up.

So concerned lives lost rather lives destroyed economic fallout? understand ridiculous right? Remember myast comments caring impact people? Kinda adding ammo that...

And yes, need tk concerned lives lost...but really better way protect people feckless, contentious, politically economically costly Lockdowns? People like Newsom Whitmer's political futures damn dumpster (at least Whitmer's case) actually decently effective keeping stare healthy. contact tracing set January? states mass testing system within first month New York getting fucked, like surprising us point. 

Lockdowns possibly temporary necessary evil....but make mistake objectively evil little evidence far lesser evil, time tell..

Bottom line, Lockdowns going forward objectively bad policy. followed, they're galvanizing support behind radical movements, they're explicitly political politicians fearing jobs continue (as should). law useless fuck point said law?

This going go way pro Lockdown people think going go point being? US seems less concerned. part infections vaccinations probably close 50% country immune. might false hope, hope.

There also lot COVID deniers US get attention. (they exist Europe too, get less attention - information many exist) Please add BREAKING headline

It’s better maximize total number people least protection. man ):


Person. Dude least ): virus 99.9% greater survivability rate.  
Ridiculousness issue cut corners didn’t release clinical trials. basically said “trust us, works” without proof. nothing Russo-phobia. Going outside apartment 8pm recklessly injuring others now? That’s fantastic! anti-vaxxer problem US would compounded purchasing Russian vaccine. vaccine clearly well designed vaccine would harm good US right now. I'm saying right, is. Well one NEEDS to. consensus ""Sure fine!""
Then yea.

If consensus ""We're sure"" ""No""... I'd skip it. vaccine numbers 2 doses plus 2 weeks. reality partial immunity gained soon first dose increased there. Youyang solid model changes frequently new data arises. Depends long goes for. I’d take working thing dragging little while. Thats awesome! said above, never claimed did. April May people saying would see entire collapse medical infrastructure without rolling lockdowns.

Some cities states pushed close brink never saw massive collapse medical infrastructure like people saying.

Even NYC, probably came closest, collapse. army medical boat hardly even touched. Thank explanation. read artifices early talked relatively slow mutation rate strains disturbing. Naw. There's still lot people affected far knowing someone got severely ill died it, continue believe. Uh, vaccine wasn’t even guaranteed think would same. 

That said, 1918 pandemic nearly deadly antibiotics, supplemental oxygen, pharmaceutical-grade steroids. ...will get mRNA vaccine. Damn, really bad. time normal healthy adults able receive vaccine, hospitalizations deaths low enough us able say pandemic well control god's sakes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lets start over:

&amp;#x200B;

1) precautions reduce deaths. 

2) even without precautions, best estimates still fewer deaths actual deaths Spanish flu even precautions

3) big part medical advancement. 

All three things true. deny? know think. I'm gonna wait hard data UK. account purchased 1 month ago. almost fucking month ago. Trump bad, Biden Trump gone long way. Sorry can’t see it. so? seems like contrary mix. H1N1 fraction problem covid19 been.  Melbourne lockdown always least favorite exact reasons mentioned I'm sorry experience that.

While think enforcement vital part mitigation, think negative reinforcement good long-term strategy. would compare Jacinda Arden's handling country's lockdown premier's? always seemed less heavy-handed lockdown emphasized temporary. delivered formal request yet variant merging thing made put phone second. That’s pure science fiction. people would better writing short stories commenting viruses. information high risk populations Florida found horrific zero plan left previous administration wonder things would even worse right actually plan. track record last 4 years shows anything tried intentionally even worse. Leaving behind good plan would ideal situation perhaps leaving behind plan realistic best-case scenario? December 24. /TASS/. letter ""V"" contained name coronavirus vaccine ""Satellite V"" means victory. stated Thursday Kirill Dmitriev, head Russian Direct Investment Fund, Twitter account drug ""V"" name vaccine means victory (from English victory - approx. TASS), wish people Argentina decisive victory disease,"" Dmitriev said, commenting delivery first doses drug Argentina. Probably deadly. seems give similar protection better vaccines. numbers many Russians vaccinated ? Russian science generally good. (Stalin sometimes kill messenger lead bad science, since tend allow scientists work inject politics afterwards) Chinese politics means take care bad scientists scientist politically powerful. 

There bad science everywhere. countries better others eliminating it. way unsustainable? People can’t listen music masks on? Curfews still allow go home work. fighting someone else another thread this. Mask wearing simple, small price pay sick winter. would adopt subways, grocery stores high contact places cold/flu season? understand maybe workers need 8 hours option running like 30 mins, throw baby let's live flu free. wouldn’t reached amount deaths followed precautions harder. didn’t precautions either, would’ve worst. You’re literally proving point.  IMO, pro-vax anti-maskers/anti-lockdowners correct along. weren’t correct everything, correct lot stuff.  People extremely lazy apathetic good day. people don’t give much shit anything consuming food media homes. can’t imagine 1 dimensional people like need stop given loud voice table. finished reading book immunology, Elegant Dr. Fauci it. opportunity I'd get autograph it.  originally thought going like Enola something really become widespread maybe cases.

People saying goodbye loved ones zoom could. sit right Let introduce r/covidiots r/masks4all. Probably safe option, then. Lol, why? want transparency? lmao fair even Russian acquaintances little distrustful. (As you’d imagine.) faith scientists rightfully proud scientific heritage consensus seems “yeah given government handled things don’t really trust it.” really unfortunate important lesson countries/companies comes transparency acting good faith. Somebody help Canada!!! Pfizer delaying shipments here!!
We run total idiots cannot negotiate! End 2nd quarter end June still ways away Exactly. reasons people get Covid factors help spread it. Herd immunity models assumed homogenous population estimated 70% infected stop spread. Using realistic heterogenous population, superspreader events like Christmas Thanksgiving, 30-40% infected+vaccinated sufficient. states like Dakotas November. Almost everywhere point now. take confirmed cases multiply factor get total cases. CDC suggest 4.6. people vehemently disagree suggest closer 2-3x. don’t feel like getting back debate data generally poor quality debates go nowhere. necessarily true, tests negative even someone (false negative, early diagnoses, etc.). might even tested right away, don’t know. seems like quite coincidence two aren’t related. It’s possible. None us actually know, making educated guesses one hell ride. offence can't wait day sub becomes irrelevant lol. Hopefully long end 2019, Flu Cold back-to-back, two month stretch coughing. 2020, sick, wore mask, sanitized.

Fuck getting sick, bad. think misunderstood tried say russian scientists requesting vaccine reviewed EMA Hope get better soon man! never should’ve followed China did. they’ve conditioned people accept something get West accept night it’s making people insane. I’m sorry education system failed you. Best luck. Sputnik? tracking probe emits low frequency beep anything? Haha let antivaxers go crazy one. get jnJ shot committed jnJ booster. Like could get pfizer shot moderna shot equal immune response ? They’ll find excuse return school getting vaccine. always guarantee.

Teachers cheat 85 year old vaccine, still refuse work. probably feel zero guilt it. Teachers unbelievably unethical pandemic.  like 100 million US actually gotten Covid. 20 million confirmed cases. Huge majority cases never confirmed testing. Surges issue need worry vulnerable vaccinated. hospitals fine there's reason worry things happening. old normal, weren’t forced wear something face forced maintain distancing people banned travel even though nothing wrong home day. i'm left-handed :) exist!! COVID-19 AKA Spicy Cold They’ve got school provided masks (for kids staff). Kids (if opened) staggered schedules, certain grades arrive staggered times go separate entrances. parents allowed school whatsoever. Kids would rotate last name attend two days week person, Wednesday closed cleaning.

Just paint full picture — I’m sure get much safer. husband works public, essential, worked hospital without shot recently. still doesn’t shot he’s still working, home much can. Many others same. 

So... I’m little frustrated all, frankly. Like soon hit 60 turn different species. work applied strategically 

Ex-fucking-actly! Sweden absolutely right recognized COVID going long-term problem, countries like Singapore also recognized planned accordingly needed lockdown since part strategy. came said countries cannot rely lockdowns. one knew vaccine going arrive making one even possible; made sense mitigate way could sustainable least year. Places like US UK acted like COVID would go away without really anything they're paying it.

Compare thought planning went NZ lockdown, lockdown threat single case either. China, thing, one big lockdown put system place deal future cases Wuhan lockdown would never repeated. J&amp;J stock near time highs. Wednesday Thursday hit high around $170, data dump Friday, returned level Tuesday week ($163). 2 days, $163 high preceding 12 months. 
 
Also sure media reading listening to. guessing also hyperbolic stock comment. hearing ""game changer"", ""normal cold storage"", ""single dose"", ""billion doses end 2021"". 
 
The unrealistic public perception efficacy differences &amp; ability see pros cons different vaccine platforms main issue here. would expect nothing less glorious Russian vaccine. Seriously though. Russia long track record vaccines I'm optimistic report accurate. flu definitely cause heart valve damage. even rhinovirus. whole pandemic ends tomorrow. Im insanely immature asking friends they'd eat 1 piece poop end covid, mature. Considering west likely using much vaccine especially since they've bought vaccines Russia/Chinas vaccines could key getting poorer countries vaccinated much sooner. would expect individuals infected viral seeding period leading wave, necessarily actual wave. look spread places like universities, happened large wave, ""second"" smaller wave seeding period large wave. larger third wave community spread would governed mobility general population. alma mater completely normal except masks campus. lot state schools point. would say university unreasonable restrictions fall, consider transfer. reason lock people doesn’t it. 

I work 8 pm.  mRNA vaccines make cells express ACE2, body immune reaction it, come previous COVID infection, would same? similar? immune response halt virus? every country. matte people top sketchy. worse others, nobody get made leader country allowed lead it. little 30% younger people, demonstrated protective value elderly infirm. Something seems weird, saying max compacity horrible believe single use. difficult sanitize disposable item every patient. idk man I'm vaccine comes vodka  Give exposure therapy. Go get coffee walk. Next day get coffee sit shop while. on! works.  Probably decision, hope nice time. wasn’t going live forever anyway. 1. engineering talent exist. 3.5% college grads engineers, foreign born immigrant background

2. tooling machinery exist. chinese manufacturers make machinery PPE face masks.

3. supply chain exist. outside limited production melt blown fabric west vast majority comes china. Medical manufacturing forcing federal, state hospital groups buy made America products.

good luck, healthcare #1 source lobby dollars US. government works them, way around. 100 years old probably wanted enjoy last little spot life. want come across bitter cynical current times one travel, see friends family, hard think I'm healthy young person US work medicine - means I'm back line.

I would get J&amp;J shot second. I'd get second shot offered 2 months later. I'd get offered 6 months later. I'd basically get shot anyone offers, many times think helpful. Thanks! Furthermore, get ""I believe science"" nonsense. mean ""believe"" it? process method understanding physical world. exists independently anyone's belief it. ""understand"" scientific process understand science constantly changing revealing new truths. also understand scientists even doctors human fallible subject pressures people. 

That read much can. Yeah, little skeptical big pharma producers huge government contracts bypassing normal safety testing protocols. Seems like lumping pharma industrialists ""scientists."" So, excuse automatically believe man white coat says. make ""science denier"" ""flat earther"" ""we ruled alien reptilians human bodies"" wacko. know vaccine is? crazy, always put left Hi! I'm freshman college, I'm wondering future.

Could students United States possibly normal semester - without masks social distancing mandates - fall? know international travel normal while, I'm hoping colleges United States, along national travel, like 2019.

And also, say ""we mostly normal"" quotes similar that, mean? willing drag pandemic want play games think enough data you.

We know things bother read anything beyond news headlines can't help you. told look, every symptomatic case every study followed thoroughly.

I prove something exist, onus hurting credibility vaccines. could easily prove one case exists given large test sizes top millions vaccinated AZ vaccine worldwide. Yet case provided. Skepticism lack data fair. people put Novavax beyond me. I'm trying promote narrative. I'm much support Covid protocols. saw comment somewhere else looking explanation come back with. rate, amount. Yeah. wrong..sorry 

You dont get back track . USA done little genomic testing, probably unknown variants emerging USA. chance viable mutation increases number cases.  consequence letting virus run rampant . seems little hopeful. article says sources, spends remaining paragraphs also fearful. can't wait panic variants combining roll through. I've already seen couple people commenting that. always use vaccinate healthcare workers though.  Check post history rofl. civil. definitely does, worked right next person covid nearly week usually right vent hood I'm hopefully still worried new variants spreading. hope set us back much. Lol, still saw though so...go play FIFA. source grandmother, sources friends whatever OAN similar news outlet she’s days. Florida, articles legitimate sources state people flying get vaccinated there. Reading lines, see easily get distorted xenophobic, right wing perspective. wait next week headline reads 'Whole UK could vaccinated Johnson' 1- No

2– Enhanced transmissibility makes small negative outcomes meaningful 

3- You’re far rabbit hole doesn’t matter anyway Sounds like Trudeau going start pressing Pfizer/Moderna produce vaccines Canada too. Precision NanoSystems Vancouver (who apparently capacity produce 240million doses) got grant retrofit facilities mRNA vaccine production.  California covid situation started improving immediately Inauguration date. Biden really much one day improve situation? No. Covid timing. situation likely improve inaguaration regardless office. 

And no, support Trump. data cut-off date analyses 7th December 2020. right about? list everything, ""a lot"" FYI, China Airlines Taiwanese carrier, Chinese one. Valhalla, hero. idea permanent masks/masks distancing vaccination August

Who government pushing that? can't think anyone US least. people think article news ""vaccinated people potentially exempted restrictions"" seen carrying thought everything went well Israel... literally signed deal domestic production today. Quit reading Sun. think Africa enough Chinese vaccines. UK keep digging grave. quite true. resistant strains - exist spread, odds go way mutation allowing resistant strain happen first place goes down. like Russia - *of course* West sink low accept Russian medicine - mainly poor countries places they're selling vaccine to. Glad see works.

Yeah, world would west suspicious vaccine coming country known history poisoning people foreign, sovereign nations?

The poisoner underpants get chance poisoner vaccines. Ask define number one, discuss it

And second one, even thing tests, people dying one knew proper response would similar, isolation, masks, try find treatment / vaccine, etc I’d worried called Chernobyl 2. 54.9% efficacy original variant? Pretty low. since mid november %of positive tests roughly 12%, stable situation

still beginning feb. 

the amount tests conducted country reached peak starting december. % stayed stable.

Which GREAT please let's avoid regular ""blame / praise new president everything last one did"". comment gone buddy, go. know heard prevent transmission extent case talking sterilizing immunity,

sterilizing immunity means virus replicate. also, clearly, prevents transmission, specific term specific meaning preventing transmission hit bar. need similar study J&amp;J since similar vaccine. Seems like 12 week booster indeed way go. Based previous study 4 week booster second shot basically wasted. improvement one dose regime give booster early. First foremost: Put oxygen mask first (no pun intended). Wear mask. Look online see whether might eligible vaccine soon (this depend age). young, know call pediatrician's office time yourself, say want talk want mom know--they dealt way zanier things ""I want vaccine"", talk you. engage debates whether *you* wear mask sign shot.

Second: try persuade change (some of) behavior favor without changing beliefs. mom otherwise history semi-reasonable, try asking please wear mask *psychological* well-being, even though know think COVID big deal. = vaccine efficacy

Imagine first vaccine announced efficacy 62% (with near complete protection severe COVID)? would happy. Ohh fault. see, read comment wrong, wonder confused Well someone feeding elderly parents lies feel need stop shit. /r/unitedkingdom sub hates him, bizarre. Link doesn’t work  That’s still huge though, 200 million people crazy. Also gotta include potential new vaccines then, imagine atleast see one new one. June 31 would least give extra day. She’s batshit crazy. microchips phones electronic devices, it’ll useless inject microchip directly human. Also, won’t effective microchips cannot work own, need electricity stuff work. felt really bad seriously explain injecting microchips bad idea, anybody double/triple digit IQ know shit.

About COVID serious disease part :

I speak everyone, experiences, mild disease got it, like got flu late 2017, way worse me. experience 0 long-term effects. contrary, 17 got started going gym losing weight immune system waking up. People may worse experiences me, lot people, like flu, little bit worse. legally allowed travel Barbados, got free travel, family preferential treatment way.

I think deserve that, rather refusing him. traditional vaccines still track second year. non-traditional ones using new techniques blown water. *Jeff Goldblum busts room.*

""It's called Sputnik!"" sorrow reflects fact took old man, one century old, raise funds NHS battle bus brexit promised 350 million extra week. RIP old dude, great show end. doesnt really square. lockdowns installed well anyone chance get masks distancing train, mask adherence high across America summer fall. hero let anyone tell different.

live dead bodies.

if they're working site lots dead bodies, dogs need end day live find. someone hide.

the dogs get depressed find bodies. 7 day average stays now, mathematically speaking vaccinated adults one jab mid late May. That's perfect world every person gets jab, reality younger demographics go people turn vaccine down, adults could done even sooner. Cries Canadian. really complex picture lots info article. Although racial inequality definitely plays significant role. I'm also white collar professional, would want go back office? Working home saves commute time (aka sleep morning time work), saves gas money wear tear car, cook lunch get chores done, dog happier I'm home, etc. much upside.

I think ideal setup 2-3 days office per week, rest home. Okay, hopeless apologist. can't stress enough: **vaccine distribution incremental.**

Canada EU little one month behind UK reach similar levels due time. takes vaccinate entire population late summer earlier. good thing April/May cases deaths start going naturally due season anyway, like even worst-case scenario Brits dancing streets everyone else cooped home entire time. someone nearly dies reinfection, good news, I'm afraid hell go taste firsthand immunity longer exists without vaccine don’t work field someone actually works field. 

Lol okay. Case closed. 

You’re either bio person bad one. lying. variants occur. you’re labeling unlikely doesn’t really say much. happen. conveniently ignore points. 

If you’re bio person think it’s wise start planning International trips things going back normal, you’re lying ignorant   Okay, it’s kind hard document reinfection. excuse British giving us evidence still need vaccines help prevent 65% higher amounts deaths. 

Get fingers ears, anti-science/anti-lockdown/whatever hell want call point, going make continue longer needed. Brings monty python flash back Johnson &amp; Johnson's 300 million June

Dubious get 300 million June, since produced 2 million doses far would need manufacture distribute 830,000 doses every day June 31 meet stretch goal. inspiration was, may rest peace!...

CA cases dropping It’s hedging, would expect almost everyone who’s knowledgeable vaccines strongly suspects prevent transmission, don’t want come say case they’re wrong celebrity someone trusts gotten mind changed? Mind pointing comment incorrect “low quality info”. It’s easily verifiable seems England pushing ahead, N.I reporting 6-8k vaccines day, population 1.9million it’s going lot longer May everyone vaccinated. think evidence shows anti-lockdown correct position. example, US number deaths state essentially relationship strict restrictions studies showing ""less invasive"" measures (e.g., banning large events, masks) place, lockdowns little impact less clear. seem conclusive evidence either way whether masks much anything, especially cloth masks people wear. 

Pro-vaccine definitely correct position. evidence far points vaccines highly effective safe. agreeing disagreeing view, sources within school leadership say go back kids vaccinated could easily say September starting happen since kids vaccine trials end around approval come even later year younger ones. aggree. 
We also keep mind that, France, antivax really present. use vaccine later demonstrated work years old, large bunch population hesitate take vaccine all.

## Abstract

**Background**

Although almost year passed since Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak promising reports vaccines presented, still long way measures available all. Furthermore, unsolved issues remained choose appropriate corticosteroids treatment COVID-19. conducted study assess effectiveness methylprednisolone treatment versus dexamethasone hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

**Method**

In prospective triple-blinded randomized controlled trial, enrolled 86 hospitalized COVID-19 patients August November 2020, Shiraz, Iran. Patients randomly allocated two groups receive either methylprednisolone (2mg/kg/day) dexamethasone (6mg/kg/day). Data assessed based 9-point ordinal scale extending uninfected (point 0) death (point 8).

**Results**

There significant variation among groups admission. However, intervention group demonstrated significantly better clinical status compared control group day 5 (4.02 vs. 5.21, *P* = 0.002) day 10 (2.90 vs. 4.71, *P* = 0.001) admission. also significant difference overall mean score intervention group, control group, (3.909 vs. 4.873 respectively, *P* = 0.004). mean length hospital stay 7.43 ± 3.64 10.52 ± 5.47 days intervention control groups, respectively (*P* = 0.015). need ventilator significantly lower intervention group control group (18.2% vs 38.1% *P* = 0.040).

**Conclusion**

In context treating hospitalized hypoxic COVID-19 patients, methylprednisolone demonstrated better results compared dexamethasone. Many UK calling cynical political move think stupid. Use Pfizer Moderna vaccines effective vulnerable older population use slightly less effective AZ vaccine younger population, least data available AZ. compelling argument. applied close basically said “no dice” looking people active society. goto stores, see family every while, eat outside week etc. looking folks work site coworkers, goto restaurants bars often, don’t wear masks etc. don’t think immune system training exists much viruses. mutate doesn’t matter already flu, example, next year get exposed different strain one year, get immune system won’t recognize it. way train immune system viruses get vaccination. flu vaccine notoriously iffy. Thought 33 million powers combined captain covid!!!   30% vaccinated. FL could done much better took precautions all. This. almost feel guilty wife (who 35 healthy) got first vaccine Saturday I'm getting first one tomorrow I'm 27. We're Illinois grandparents early 70's able get yet they're Maryland. I'm happy wife finally able feel secure, especially since mental health disasterous almost year this, feel fair. whole thing ridiculous. 3 depressing dystopian af.  Russia politicized vaccine racing first vaccine, registering based preliminary data, willing wait full report Phase III trials. Basically, Russian government rolled dice betting vaccine winner knew exactly effective was.

That bet paid data coming outside observers giving thumbs up. Ultimately, I'm glad vaccine ended safe, effective, cheap around $5 dose. Sputnik V likely vaccine choice developing nations buy 1/4 Pfizer's asking price $20 per dose. Stats gender? I'm willing believe men can't take anymore nagging women
 /s

Kidding aside, guess really need step outdoors get oxytocin social interactions. Specially prone depression. Exactly, tend forget everyone necessarily needs vaccine next months. People live rurally, instance, wait much longer time simply due circumstances. I'm many vaccines fast get them, course, saying we're estimating numbers, many individuals tucked away simply risk someone living city center. first sentence... thought never expected ignorance people governments allowed things get bad / ignore CDCs numbers, correct shit medical advances Russia. government proven untrustworthy matters tendency steal countries IP. tests instead trials. good/reassuring know!  exciting news let’s forget 95,000 people died January. need number vaccines administered per day ramp quickly. federal government needs step make sure states making best use vaccine states receiving enough vaccines cover everyone groups 1A,B C believe it?

If does, post proof life, end this. won't, isn't.  Brad Pitt gonna star movie Fauci’s life 5 years now? know, right? Somewhere someone still this!! ever considered maybe since virus doesn’t affect everyone equally, maybe shouldn’t restrict people equally? put voluntary nursing home lockdowns give recommendations old people careful enforce anything else? People absolutely overthinking overworrying this.

 get vaccines - doses - isolate 3 weeks build immunity, could still infected COVID-19. might get really mild case asymptomatic case, come contact someone vaccinated antibodies yet, could infect could end needing hospitalized.

We long way herd immunity. I’ll respond agree you. It’s tough decipher experts listen to. going sound dangerous, you’re right. Doctors view things purely medical standpoint. example, bad liver infection 10 years ago landed hospital. weeks treatment, doctor refuses sign return work slip, said long way go. sick bank nearly expended, didn’t savings live of. went back work anyway, got different physicians signature. 

The point being, medically may 100%, would’ve financially ruined heeded advice 100%. It’s simply sustainable go route lockdowns stay home forever. comes point utilitarian philosophy take decide there’s gonna much recognizable society go back continue allow things way. I’m expert, I’m sharing experience. Overall, we’re trending toward finish line thing, shouldn’t issue much longer. I’m hopefully summer get serious relief. additional screaming, especially anti mask motherfuckers delayed flights caused havoc deep stupidity.  Kinda I've thinking little while.

We're going play whack-a-mole vaccines vs variants, virus spreads population next 4-5 years.  better infecting cells, probably leads symptomatic cases. One capacity constraints beyond actual amount drug product drug available many vials filled given period time. 

This *should* help improve throughout, approved.  even define ""based"" without looking up? Exactly. careful *any* subreddit dedicated people sharing experiences illness such. hard come subreddits straight head. US trial data comes out. think also similar issue Novavax since results Uk trial. Although long thr US trial results come out. Nike : definitely slept worst part pandemic. Things getting better March Ur sad person OP asked something semi conservative backed logic thought would good source given it’s data driven, provides data predictions based on. states may begin transition normal soon second quarter 2021 I’m sure seems depressing? Mexico Canada would next list US. Central America that, followed South America. Well, day 2 1/2, lol. reaction first dose 4 days later, aside sore arm. two coworkers ""flu like symptoms"" today though. Second dose definitely hit us harder. That's great news, hopefully vaccines prevent large amount transmission. Cali Florida like Cali better while, worse Florida.

Okay, link data pls. Sure personal responsibility. can't make blanket statement though. justify someone's death COVID OK. ""Well fat anyways"". People encouraged positively lose weight. mocked shamed they're fat. blamed obesity. way encourage loved ones get drug alcohol abuse smoking.

A lot society issue well. US, go grocery store 80% what's shelves total garbage body. High fat, high calorie, high sodium, high carbs especially high fructose corn syrup. make strong conscious effort eat healthy. also time prepare proper meals. real easy quick grab go healthy fast food either. 

I'm back track getting fit (for probably third time last ten years) struggle life responsibilities. single dad, two young kids, working, grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, laundry, name it. Getting 5am getting bed 11pm challenge sleep afford get make proper meal prep exercise. mention chronic fatigue, bit better I'm fit, still exists.

jk vaccination effective training immune system virus protects against. flu vaccination spotty guess strain going around vaccinate it. necessary stable viruses like chicken pox measles (but also benefits disease all). probably effect viruses.

There benefit training immune system overreact foreign pathogens, that's generally related viruses, particularly seasonal ones. list full can't schedule someone october? we're vaccinating 700,000 new people day, assuming nothing else changes, will, means we'll 200 million people vaccinated US. There's fucking way 65 year old included that, either spouting bullshit heard bullshit. feel like giving tbr athletes vaccine doses wouldn’t hard, like many there? Probably hundred? California variant since probably Labor Day Oh yeah...Twindemic 🙄 Probably whatever godforsaken reason, many experts media outlets decided pretend vaccines highly effective somehow key returning normal life. know there's much surprise people hear think ""why bother then?"" Right - I'm already low-risk category. I'm ok getting mild covid symptoms days vaccine least prevent major illness/hospitalization/long-term effects/death. ""lower efficacy"" vaccines would great millions us already low risk. [coronavirus: what’s going wrong Sweden care really. clearly says ""some survivors"", ""all survivors"". Mostly started later due later approval

Canada approving vaccines earlier EU add state efforts since don’t give pharmacies now? Like super vaccination sites? half vaccinated offers lot protection 50%.... love looking back Predictions, someone predicted PA would see 20k cases per day, max ever got 12,700 cases 1 day, dropped. Manitowoc

Probably charged Brendan Dassey crash. America does. dick around monumentally flub early responses variety reasons (fractured state system, political inertia, individualism, take pick reason). 

Then backs wall things awful, turn around introducing groundbreaking way combating initial problem. See also: WW2 bomb many examples throughout history.  Pogrom-I не прокатил gonna wish still coma. several colds kid goes creche (husband essential worker) Source Anthony Fauci saying 85% threshold upper part ranges.  alarmist part *if ever*. 

It’s deal “natural immunity lasts x months” data long.  obviously don’t way prove literally called day opened told early March soonest date.

Like another poster said though I’m sure might change supply goes up. Thanks! Even today apparently pissed friend speaking reality industry worked 15 years (just got laid off), didn’t mesh Republican Governor saying. People really don’t seem want reality intrude cozy, convenient worldview. see, thanks. inactived virus targets spike, right? mean, recognize many parts virus. think read Sinopharm's one almost equally effective SA variant. *:Cries brazilian:*

We vaccine 3% population here. simply adds vaccination venue options doses, doesn’t take away federal, state local efforts. States still control vaccination efforts best carried out. Canadian looking vaccination numbers, extremely jealous.  me, that's high water mark shoot for.

It's good goal, also number advantages really scale (established centralized national health system, unified medical records allocation, extremely urban population clustered locations, etc). Changes mobility lower well better explanation. think we've hit sort immunity threshold. theory talking allow resurgence restrictions lifted mobility changes spreaders already immune. see resurgence every single state holiday period case. Pacific northwest California obvious examples double peak caused holidays. Hazmat suits coming next. huge comment thread count?

Also, /r/antivax appears pro-vaccine. That’s depressing Good God, much taken us Finance related quote, appropriate facts change, change mind - do, sir?” - John Maynard Keynes There's way that's true tbh  I'll repeat: **not** hospitalizations/deaths vast majority people worried about! bad cold, it'd still severe disease high chance long-term damage.  carry heavy metal pockets weight always dumb prediction imo. course covid precautions also work flu, spreads less begin with. fucking joke. science 'so clear' settled, coming two masks better? whole time could wearing two masks would potentially better off? buying it.

The CDC recommend want. I'm sticking one mask. That's ignorant way thinking this?

Less 48 hours ago (related snow storm pandemic) rate US going, certainly. I'm sure US would like see border restrictions lifted biggest trading partner. I've seen alot people sub claim failiure. never thought I'd see actual vaccine snobs. Fauci, come Brazil. Florida huge surge July size (in deaths) one that's currently falling. California nothing time - *first* major surge now. timelines matter, need take account.

If want compare deaths end day, compare FL states locked hard. killed lot fewer people NY, NJ, IL, etc, (and larger margin). Either compare everything nothing - picking one state metrics like, crafting narrative rather trying discuss rationally. piece SARS people getting SARS spanish flu worries, happens us sometimes multiple people get conversation. February it’s totally possible. everyone spends every waking moment r/Coronavirus. Single-dose regimen gave 67% reduction overall PCR positivity 22-90 days post-vaccination. another great result study. Lol ok? anything? 😂 I'd honestly pretty happy live world health officials like Osterholm Ferguson job. Hell no, would like see restaurant workers get bumped line. Everyone wants go eat/ drink majority don’t mask. must caught last March unexplained rash/ hives body. one knew was. Lmao they're gonna start manufacturing vaccine late year, fact everyone hailing accomplishment shows delusional Canadians 76% really good. set target 50%, flu vaccine. get focused numbers see higher/lower vaccines. protect serious illness.

Also, shows UK strategy right call. doubt access ongoing trails. Leaving longer, contrary reddit experts claims, actually better call according study.

AZ also working others mass produce cost, working Russian vaccine maker see UK one joined either/both made really good see politics left behind. traditional vaccines easier mass produce, way easy transport get poorest countries. heavy lifting rest world. Pfizer must pleased, hitting every symbolic goalpost could: first approved, high efficacy, new technology, better-than-estimated delivery volumes. kind feel bad AstraZeneca, since they've working asses non-profit - series blunders, slower-than-estimated progress, stiff competition mean they've overshadowed Pfizer's success. headline article slightly misleading. [Pfizer (go page 6 slide deck) say ""**expect deliver 200M doses U.S. end May""*****.*** means schedule they've touting little now. saw somebody claim ""failure""

Fucking idiot.

It snobbery. conventional CHEAP. people like that. real question opening restaurants limited capacity make things worse. think occam's razor rules comparison infected animal transmitting population Yes I'm aware, case countries too? personally believe formal restrictions remain least medium term two main reasons. 

1. want encourage low risk people cut line get restrictions delay vaccinations high risk people. 

2. element population lie vaccinated get restrictions. Right probably people fully vaccinated. could administratively challenging prove people vaccinating way people cannot game. 

Both change vaccines become much available. 1 pretty much go away 2 fraction people would lie goes many people vaccinated. think saying drop like countries. COVID literally come waves, that's happened come countries. guess that, even without J&amp;J, sometime April see vaccine open everyone (to fight appointments least, knows youd get it) California taxed absurd amount cost living high. Tax dollars genuinely flushed drain seems. forest management joke resulting horrendous air quality third every year. hard business there.

If wasn’t rooted California, I’d move Florida simply cost living. Yes, still respecting local business regulation. IE, I'll wear mask even want business says they're required.  many people turning vaccine production/distribution ramping up, would willing bet get access vaccine early Summer. Well cold Pfizer, That's still good. Thank leaving there. gave first good laugh day! That's name. No, I'm saying Italy Spain got taken badly surprise.

The UK Germany excuse. Right, understand people seem think cotton mask hazmat suit Exactly. pfizer bad science. I'm sure time tell really young kids. Vaccine trials young kids tough though. wants toddler guinea pig? COVID pretty much neutralized throughout general population. Although, kids 11 12 now, hoping get vaccine fall school starting, that's even likely stretch. I'd definitely feel comfortable did. why?

Sold mother fucking COST!

This one (along ones) would ""great""? going allow doses super vaccination sites take away state allotments? Yes, also there's small group people planned got pregnant gave birth pandemic. serious 11 months plan, conceive, give birth time small percentage people. thought rich already jumping ahead line. data - given J&amp;J AZ use second vector - would likely suggest want doses spread long period regardless, 3-month delay even bad probably. anything, data points 12 week wait making vaccine \*more\* effective. mention 76% effectiveness second dose! Sleep easy. lot people, catching coronavirus moral failure. thanks Dr. Sputnik, Sputnik vaccine ready Sputnik little three Sputniks NY IL earlier surges worse weather deal FL.

Sure parts CA worse weather FL too, yet CA whole still far less death per capita FL. FL failed even weather time advantages.

And FL still woods, DeSantis knows this, it’s didn’t take victory lap time like last spring.  I’ll take Johnson&amp;Johnson Bakers Lung serious thing inhibits capacity breathe. imagine doesn’t play nice covid Novavax’s also easy store move, it’s effective transmissible variants. Moderna’s vaccine also stored standard fridge 30 days. agree, everyone great job get working vaccine all, new strains particular cause concern less effective vaccines like AZ. addition, multiple countries restricting AZ’s vaccine 65s.
All (including future ones like Inovio, Imperial College etc) needed though. Please tell more.  200m doses Pfizer Moderna. 400m doses total, 200m people. Amazing plan people assigned work do. BMI 28, eat lot food weekend make cutoff group 1b? It’s insane, isn’t it? It’s like America existing two entirely separate universes. Says 

study found chilblains, rashes hives could indicators individual contracted Covid-19. biggest problem mutants vaccine may work them.

That's risk, sure. sounds like reduced efficacy far likely risk. E.g., Novavax study shows still works South African UK variants &lt;50% efficacy former. Even reduction maybe reduce severity illness? 

Apparently need studies.

Meanwhile race immunize recent variants dominant (or new variants appear suppose). Well, contagious doesn’t mean deadly. makes sick low probability killing you, won’t stop things reopening. California hellhole always migration increases/decreases. claim coast state hellhole, it’d Florida. You’re either uber rich poor. truly deserving name “armpit America.”

These two close actually working Europe though, none countries exactly ready travel summer anyway.

Don't get wrong, EU really fucked this, they'll still vaccinated at-risk groups like April. Aug/Sep UK/EU/USA similar positions think. Imagine treated potentially fatal things way. states lost doses feds?

Would allow super vaccination sites get doses since states need send pharmacies? Nah, didn’t bring CA this, I’ll compare since brought OP. It’s really much concern totally ruin optimism, keep check around -18 C Oh, forgot might also option use 200M order booster shots new variants. Fuck yeah I've hoping May/June regular middling-health middle-aged person. timeframe looks likely I'm okay riding next months home.  Push late summer I'll start issues actually expected. intervals studies pruposefully small effort speed studies. No, suspect many stuck mindset take time bring back normal, expect even risk-averse return normal point. Show something FL well economically? say check economy, do, get pissy. California colleges planning full resumption in-person classes fall. may occupancy restrictions masking requirements, believe resources weekly testing students/faculty/staff keep case counts &amp; positivity low, even Fall Surge due mutant strains. oh, thanks, know name came head. Symptomatic Covid ? zero problem Russian developed long tested western authorities production/distribution chains monitored.  Moderna Pfizer already working boosters current vaccine demonstrates decreased efficacy variants. think likely scenario we'll vaccine reduces R value sufficiently, Dr Fauci says may take longer get woods resistant variants spread. even people got vaccinated continue take precautions. Per capita not, that’s 2.2 million people would’ve died without measures. Even less people affected per capita, allowed that? want allow weaker virus kill people stronger one? would he? flu vaccines around number believe.

Not even close except elderly. Look CDC numbers see 15-50 year age range many years often single digit effectiveness usually around 10% Wait, actually? like 107% effectiveness rate, actually realistic? Wow actually got sick May 2020. Fever, chills, works. Still sense smell taste though, think accepted kind ""the"" defining symptom. Went get test, negative. Antibodies, negative.

I barely even left house like... March May, knows got whatever got? Food delivery maybe? Still baffles bit, honest. never said implied that. opposite fact. now, special treatment fully vaccinated? know need still wear masks physically distant, live someone suspected COVID still isolate?  “Two weeks ago, Yang announced quarantining potentially exposed Covid-19 campaign staffer.”

But could this? especially, kn95's I'll giving friends family still waiting vaccinations “Two weeks ago, Yang announced quarantining potentially exposed Covid-19 campaign staffer.”

But could this? line cook hard. Lots drink drugs job. already fucking hot wear mask 10 hour shift.

I went get sushi day 3 chefs masks nose. lady back even wearing one.

I told host picking order soon got there. ordered 6x population would take flu vaccine even 10% effective. takes 10 minutes get shot decrease risk worth it. Yeah guess so, shame, figured worth try. They've suggesting people wear N95 now. France pushing it, Harvard medical also suggested past two weeks. got first dose 1/4, week later, red, itchy rash injection site two days. delayed reaction fever, chills, body aches day 4.

I got second dose 1/31, rash yet, symptoms besides sore arm.  shoulder ready earth triple blinding?

Source? thought first confirmed case US Jan 19th, first confirmed case Italy Feb 21st? initial reports vaccine efficacy came out, said Pfizer’s Moderna’s best reducing transmission Yeah absolutely. I'll still wear masks asked legally mandated follow whatever I'm legally required do, roommates planning brewery crawl Catchy.

You wanna come ~~Netflix 'n' Chill~~ Wuhan Rona? Defense Production Act

Good idea!

Mina says manufacturers big capacity make $1 tests huge quantities, thing holding back FDA approval. FDA insisting PCR-level sensitivity, Mina says *wrong* thing; relative insensitivity rapid tests makes useful diagnosing whether someone infectious. know FDA budged that, following developments closely enough know. Better metric though? Oxford/AstraZeneca cheap, easy store move - could end multiples effective global basis mRNA vaccines.

This way decry others - boffins done excellent job round applauded.

But saying others 'better' reductive way looking it, think. Cold places probably mass vaccination sites indoors, like stadium roof. person replying saying UK public essentially experimented real time MHRA. hope works out, decision supported statistically significant data yet. ""ground maintenance workers"" ""maids""? could argue share overlapping demographics.

My wild guess they're either outdoor working alone. Possibly wearing least *basic* PPE like dust mask and/or glasses, sort gloves.

That is, mean groundskeepers housekeepers.  get legit KN95 masks, filter effective N95s.

Where less effective fit. want make sure good seal. double elastic bands shape n95s make easier ear loops KN95s. make sure mask snug possible get really close.

Be careful though, many fake KN95s market. buy amazon ebay. see Home Depot something probably fine. powecom ones bonafide verified reliable want online source. could go kf94 - korean-made masks also offer level protection less fakes there. Interesting, thank much :) following would prefer?:

Ty, stay safe.   isn’t apocalyptic scenario. Viruses mutate, COVID continue mutate. vaccines rolled out, effect covid. Covid likely forever, restrictions aren’t going place forever. social end pandemic sooner medical end. don’t know whether still infect others vaccinated.  isn’t computing me....

 *""Don't know""* *""no doesn't""*

Past experience viruses favour vaccines reducing transmission. assuming data would risky. see crazy. par Western counterparts(the mRNA ones almost) ... even better J&amp;J AstraZeneca. 2007 decade ago haha people already wear masks, no? late polution gotten much worse people wear mask daily even pandemic. meant mask always ""gone"". people already conscience wear mask personal courtesy responsibility contagious disease prevent others catching without govt mandate us. didn’t change anything. *reminded* read rules already existed  anyone know Astrazenica conducting LD/SD (half dose + full dose) studies right now? really like *Mars missions* still referred ""Sputnik"" say ""Don't worry guys, they're far ahead, r-right?"". Bro take L Ahh understand. 00.20% 👌  I'm perfectly fine skeptics/deniers getting people want get it. see peers havent turned radioactive frogs they'll want too. still dont whatever, adults desperate it. one died Covid (even hospitalised) 21 days injection No, Oxford developed - - vaccine lowest efficacy major candidate far, worst efficacy Adenovirus vectored candidates. Then, chose production partner nearly zero vaccine production experience, AstraZeneca, proceeded completely fail meet over-ambitious promises.

There’s basically nothing recommend AstraZeneca product “it’s better nothing all” “it gives UK locally produced vaccine rally around stoke nationalistic sentiment”.

AstraZeneca realize pickle in, *AstraZeneca pursuing plan produce Sputnik V license*, either combined lieu Oxford vaccine.  EU's FDA topic people saying shorter interval often effect vaccines, particularly unusual idk. I'm vaccine scientist can't say whether that's unusual not, amuses many reddit feel qualified say. Either there's surprisingly large concentration vaccine scientists lot people talking ass. Many strains active coronavirus yet vaccines seem continue effective. anger EU threatening produce themselves, late game, restrict supply, countries relying supply able source options. UK said start position screwing countries, help UK roll complete. many grocery store workers died ? Actually it’s EU that’s [holding Pfizer’s vaccine going Canada. vaccine suppliers significantly slowed deliveries Canada combination manufacturing delays demands Europe, Canada procures doses, restrict vaccine exports subject EU approval.


Though, fair, reason procured EU Trump admin said wouldn’t allow export US-produced vaccines. funny think commonalities are. Canada? store outside cause cold fuck. interesting read seeing today's UCSF study highest mortality rates happening among line cooks bakers. ime, people grasp exponential growth want to, even basic education.

Yes, invested lot little production. since too. government taken guess yearly now, probably point. mention risk countries blocking access foreseeable. 

The uk put really strong position. Yes, immune system also changes dramatically age. 

For example, flu shot highly ineffective +65 year olds. That’s nowadays +65 olds need high dosages flu shots. Data trials Brazil, South Africa UK shows Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine highly effective 12 week gap doses.

Efficacy fact much higher 12 week interval shorter gap.

The data also show single dose delivers strong protection — crucially — wane quickly.

12 weeks first dose, efficacy still well 70%.

And perhaps importantly all, data found even one recipient vaccine became severely ill Covid-19 requiring hospitalisation

Every single participant admitted hospital Covid-19 placebo group

Via Twitter, John Burn-Murdoch I'm optimistic supportive world opening local level, think variant fear going cause delay terms international travel. 

I think find vaccine natural immunity enough keep variants form bad, point (and hopefully I'm right) see international travel issue.

It really hasn't. difference data 100 people, people get runny nose sore throat. vaccines vaccine primarily intended - stopping people getting badly sick.

Nice. didn’t u get way back september what-if day long, scenario describe basically likely brand new pandemic something unrelated Covid. Possible, sure. likely enough waste energy worrying about.

We kinda tried that, point what-iffing opposite direction. 'The pandemic hoax' 'it'll easter' 'masks losers'. 

At point open possibility negative trends perhaps less 'what if'. lucky. Woke up, showered, ate breakfast...then went back bed slept 9. Fatigue, chills, aches--so glad took work today. 1. Lab creation always hallmarks/fingerprints. fingerprints splicing genetic code glycosylation patterns (or lack thereof) due lack fully functioning immune system tissue culture. saying obviously know sure bit cop out, evidence lab creation there. Furthermore, found similar viruses wild. evidence points wild origin virus.

2. impact. benefits drawbacks various vectors independent virus origin.  Short answer: don’t know. 

Long answer: Even infect others, it’s **very likely** less infectious weren’t vaccinated. reason simply stronger immune system = less time infected lower peak viral load. 

Less time infected means less time contagious.

Less time contagious means less transmission per infected person . go test results correspond clinical presentation, new specimen taken retested using different NAT technology."" 

Straight WHO. Mask requirements probably widely relaxed daily new cases drop ~5 cases per 100k (currently ~45 US). They'll probably stick around bit longer airlines especially vaccination progress overseas. think people probably continue wear masks public flu season, would soft recommendation rather requirement. Athletes getting vaccine camera increase likelihood black people feel safe getting vaccine. 

So again, question goal get people vaccinated it’s harm people don’t like. 

If it’s get people vaccinated stop spread, NBA players getting vaccine camera correct choice. found it, mixture both, could definitely better have. Awesome. Can't wait get vaccine normlancy like before. definitely tested new variants. considering J&amp;J’s effective their’s nearly identical first Sputnik shot, it’s probably pretty promising Awesome. Can't wait get vaccine normlancy like before. Awesome. Can't wait get vaccine normlancy like before.  100, don’t really think gave fuck looked like Mask requirements probably relaxed daily new cases drop ~5 cases per 100k (It's currently around 45). They'll probably stick around bit longer airlines especially vaccination progress overseas. think people probably continue wear masks public flu season, would soft recommendation rather requirement. France saying frail vulnerable 90 year old vaccinated 64 year old should.

France saying that. Stop lying. giving 65s vaccines shown effective age group.

They arent giving vaccines arent shown effective.

They give AZ vaccine high risk groups retirees. medical professionals. Every AZ vaccine get Pfizer / Moderna vaccine extra 65s.

France foolishly trying follow strategy vaccinating elderly vaccinating anyone else done. resulted 50 jabs per week one point. changed stupid strategy. vaccinating people young 50 still conservative compared countries rolling much faster. people get AZ vaccine.

Most countries vaccinating young medical professionals. sister brother law twenties thirties UK Ireland. gotten jab. people get AZ vaccine. really enjoyed Winnipeg. Even though January.

In areas schools remained closed, students, especially poor minority students, far behind rest children country. 

That’s thought process.

The medical community near unanimous schools must open person. So, point, you’re in-person learning, you’re basically saying “We’re going ignore science recommendations order place worse position.”

That’s tad silly. 

This one rare instances closed schools don’t go hand-in-hand massive lockdowns crater economy decade, good. think places actions government basically killed city’s economy placed generation poor children behind peers. 

The sad thing middle class leaves areas move places didn’t lockdown thus jobs offer, they’ll able children catch back up.

The poor children? They’ll stuck dead areas absolutely hope. parents won’t able move Texas Florida Georgia take advantage booming economies there.

It’s horrible. 

I think we’re far enough along pandemic see differences vast majority country never shut schools areas did. areas much worse. 

So ignore scientific advice keep areas worse? Sorry, I'm realizing discussion pointless, live word unwilling get information you.

You completely ignore anything say. example even small insignificant details. corrected incorrectly call JFK Jr, first name Robert, still continue refer way (I guess make look like somebody's opinion matters). reason even known anyone last name. sub got weird somewhere around June came back closer reality around Christmas. even said words assumed antimasker bad faith political troll. could say something totally factual (“by time hit herd immunity least 2 million americans would dead”) you’d people ready hang you. Production distribution same? planet on? Production distribution same? planet on? Honest question know...

I live Florida daily case numbers positive rate seems place. Yesterday cases 5,000s (good us) today 10,000. 5,000 drop 15,000 day. one day high percent positive rate dropped went back up.

Am looking much this? they've already said pharmacies get doses week so... issue clarify, 26.4m people received least 1 dose vaccine 26.3m cumulative confirmed cases reported date. active cases, total since start pandemic. Also don’t mind something watch TV I've heard also cheaper buy way, people tend buy consume more!  Oh come like he's waking Mad Max hellscape. He'll need wear mask/distance/stay home adjust weird things. He'll fine. guessing going keep altering according variations, like flu. may need one every 12-18 months.

That good business. Please... nothing coherent based verifiable fact say, keep quiet. nothing harm. 3 mil doses distributed today nice Sorry, find hard believe, especially study Sputnik-V Russia. least poison, thank universe that. I’m glad vaccines coming out, really putting eggs one basket them. That's suspicion well. Northeast redditors comment public vaccination sites closed cities? 

Regardless, numbers today very, disappointing. day low since December 12. might something interested in.  ofc does. eliminate spread though. still happen. reduces chance virus spreading think countries rolling vaccine 4-week delays

Hasn't AZ data whole time saying 12 weeks best? I'm sure talking criticism UK waiting long. I, one, ready eat traditional post-innoculation Costco hot dog ignored 15 minutes shot. first? People getting vaccinated month now. he's anything like me, last bit optimism humanity crushed seeing selfishly pandemic handled live. I've lost respect least 80 percent people used care past year alone. kind feels like joy experience future false temporarily bury feelings. That's way live. drinking least tripled year.

I'm beginning cut back, exercise, tend mental health more, totally get someone would want give past year. I'm fighting I'm stubborn, can't judge blame choices. seen statistically higher deaths past year especially among elderly, think next 3-4 years we'll see statistically lower deaths. Basically bunch deaths front-loaded Covid.  also fun fact: Mir means world peace It’s strict all. Nothing enforced besides dining restrictions select counties. Well athletes, coachers, team owners etc probably far gets payed NBA essential slightest. anything imagine amount idiots watching games together home create good knows many super spreader events chances superbowl gonna even bigger scale. Society 1918 vastly different today. Interconnected air travel, time inventory. even close same. 

Additionally, don’t know you, one stopping socializing I’m able essentially want (and people do). 

The much ballyhooed restrictions US soft except comes businesses. check 1918 businesses also restrictions areas required masks.

There also shortage anti-maskers people crying restrictions. both? tag Good News?  read article. Fuck you, wait line. much nor'easter contributed low numbers? see New York reopening vaccination sites tomorrow know vaccinations across entire Mid-Atlantic ground virtual halt.

This means even grandma vaccinated probably seeing COVID case counts much much lower.  Applies same. hitting million doses day Biden took office. certain. one security expert said processes anonymizing data reversible. said without touch irony lol Old and/or obese reduce immunity mecanism Drunks would drive old cars don’t them. ran poll asking people close every restaurant bar cancel every sporting event group activity country year virus 5% fatal nursing homes, 1% fatal elderly, 0.1% fatal healthy adults 0.001% fatal healthy kids, curious see response would be. Amen brother. masks gone? difficulty predicting strains circulate most, underlying technology Sooo, means Oxford vaccinated people catching covid passing people? less nonvaccinated.  Yes lol Mostly observing posts r/pharmacy job offers CVS walgreens recruit people like ""lmao, hell no, going back hellhole""

Also angle federal government needs stop leaving independent pharmacies. Independent pharmacies dying breed yet better patients staff. year without gastro :) That's great analogy!

The spread highly contagious coronavirus variant first identified Britain sparking worry future surge Southern California, one nation’s two hot spots strain.

Scientists say essential keep coronavirus transmission low ramp vaccinations quickly, variant spins control, hospital systems could become overwhelmed. variant, known B.1.1.7, identified 467 people 32 states. Florida seen cases, least 147, followed California, least 113.

B.1.1.7 expected become dominant variant within weeks. L.A. County officials announced second confirmed case Saturday said “spreading county.” least two cases identified San Bernardino County.

San Diego County California’s largest cluster known cases B.1.1.7, least 109, plus 44 others linked epidemiologically known cases variant, officials said last week. Health authorities San Diego County announced last week first death linked B.1.1.7, 71-year-old man household contact someone confirmed infected variant. Two people hospitalized variant.

The median age sickened B.1.1.7 30, strain identified newborns age 77, said Dr. Wilma Wooten, San Diego County health officer.

The emergence B.1.1.7 “requires us remain vigilant, complacent, continue take necessary precautions slow spread,” warned Nathan Fletcher, chair San Diego County Board Supervisors.

B.1.1.7 led rapid expansion COVID-19 across U.K., Ireland Portugal quickly became dominant strain countries, Natasha Martin, associate professor UC San Diego Division Infectious Diseases Global Health, told Board Supervisors last week.

“This particular variant estimated 50% 70% transmissible previous variants, leading surges cases,” Martin said. “There recent evidence may lead higher mortality well.”

California first detected B.1.1.7 variant Dec. 30 San Diego County. It’s estimated account 5% circulating strains, Martin said.

“The question whether strain become dominant, long take, effect epidemic trajectory, given increased transmissibility,” Martin said.

The dominance B.1.1.7 could dramatically worsen pandemic California. Currently state, effective reproduction number — average number people contagious person transmits coronavirus — around 0.8. means every infected person transmits virus fewer one person, explains pandemic improving state. B.1.1.7 become dominant strain, reproduction number could become greater 1, Martin warned.

Officials need operate caution reopening economy, said. Even decent vaccination plan match U.K. variant people abandon wearing masks practicing physical distancing, according simulation Martin presented.

If people reject measures, many fall, San Diego County likely see case count — currently 1,500 new cases day, lowest roughly two months — rise much 7,000. would far worse anything county experienced far pandemic. county topped 3,600 new coronavirus cases day seven-day period ended Jan. 12.

“This scenario ... would overwhelm health systems,” Martin said. “There emerging data B.1.1.7 [strain] lethal. could expect even deaths we’re seeing every case.”

Reducing amount circulating virus would delay expansion B.1.1.7, Martin said.

“I can’t stress enough — emergence B.1.1.7 strains may transmissible potentially lethal — time double reducing transmission expanding vaccination,” Martin said.

Concern strain, well high number daily cases, led Wooten last week retain San Diego County order prohibits restaurants allowing outdoor dining 10 p.m. 5 a.m.

Dining locations comprised 20% confirmed community outbreaks last 10 months, according San Diego County.

Wooten told supervisors uncomfortable allowing restaurants reopen outdoor dining service late night often transitioned parties, households mixing people drinking wearing masks.

“I uncomfortable — number cases still — changing particular order time,” Wooten said.

San Francisco also kept place order requiring customers leave outdoor dining areas 10 p.m.

That’s different stance L.A. County, Friday allowed outdoor dining resume, including late-night hours. L.A. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Monday U.K. variant thus far dominant county. urged people continue wear masks, practice physical distancing stay home much possible — and, dining outdoors restaurants, adhere new rules.

Those rules include dining table members household, six people spaced least eight feet tables. Outdoor dining areas must least two noncontiguous sides completely open increase flow breezes dissipate exhaled virus particles, guests urged wear masks servers approach.

“That’s we’re trying right now: Keep numbers low possible wait get vaccines really accelerate pace vaccinations,” Ferrer said.

The vaccines currently available believed effective B.1.1.7.

Officials also voiced concern variant identified South Africa, B.1.351, closely related variant Brazil, P.1. South African strain detected two cases South Carolina — different parts state believed epidemiologically linked — one Maryland. Brazilian strain identified single case Minnesota.

Current vaccines found less effective South African variant, although “it still cutoff would expect degree efficacy,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, U.S. government’s top infectious diseases expert.

Nonetheless, scientists government officials working additional booster shot case officials feel it’s needed protect new strains.

“This wake-up call us,” Fauci told reporters briefing Friday. “We continue see evolution mutants. means ... nimble able adjust readily make versions vaccine actually specifically directed toward whatever mutation actually prevalent given time.”

We must also ramp vaccination efforts quickly can, Fauci said. “Viruses cannot mutate don’t replicate,” noted.

It’s coincidence rise mutations occurring nations coronavirus run rampant.

“Letting virus run wild, like [the U.S. and] Brazil did, endangers everyone,” Dr. Ashish Jha, dean Brown University School Public Health, tweeted.

The emergence U.K. strain could mean summer — rather quiet period coronavirus — could result higher prevalence, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner U.S. Food Drug Administration, told CBS News’ “Face Nation” Sunday.

“What’s going likely happen prevalence going high certain regional hot spots. we’ll hot spots infection maybe epidemics parts Florida, parts Southern California, B.1.1.7. They’ll never really get it, rest country see prevalence come down,” Gottlieb said.

Gottlieb said South African Brazilian variants — unlike U.K. strain — don’t seem transmissible original virus. means “we time get control variants develop new boosters could protect them,” Gottlieb said.

Michael Osterholm, director University Minnesota’s Center Infectious Disease Research Policy, offered far dire forecast Gottlieb’s interview Sunday NBC News’ “Meet Press.” Osterholm compared U.K. variant forming hurricane predicted new surge six 14 weeks.

Nope. Infection starts alveolar cells, lower respiratory tract.

Well previous two posts rather unlettered hard interpret, surprised got something wrong. all, that's asked clarify. 

Again, vaccines induce sterilizing immunity many individuals, all, many. Vaccination rate Austria truly something else. average getting 0.02-0.03 percent population vaccinated per day, getting 1 1000 vaccinated considered good week. like collectively hate Osterholm threads... False. line LeBron James Kevin Durant would picked everywhere. people you’re trying influence aren’t tuned local news channel. They’re Twitter ESPN. barely get people wear one mask. We're vaccinating children yet, like 56 million adults. think plan indeed receive gigantic continuous supply.  Meanwhile they’ve screwed Canada elderly vulnerable people dying droves. feel like would nice US could least allow doses come Canada vulnerable vaccinated (over 50s example). Otherwise you’ll healthy people teens twenties vaccinated elderly. good way treat ally major trade partner. hard say. Ministry Health says 1.5 million regional data suggest actually closer 300-500 thousand. estimates bad country 146 million people. That’s point lol. Don’t gather friends. It’s eating restaurant that’s generally dangerous proper restrictions. It’s sitting across 4 random friends haven’t seen 6 months hanging others. isn’t complicated - think like std. masks condoms, vaccines excellent birth control std cure. stick bunch random people without protection also got stuck random people... eventually gonna get got. concept. Go ahead. let kids reddit scold lol saying ""millions people coming every country"", high and/or unaware policies measures place preventing people go nearest town, mention visiting different country continent. way 5-6 months going different, even virus magically vanishes May people broke fly anywhere, least Japan. Wake dude. dont even know fucking looking data rofl. Moderna made vaccine 2 days sometime last January, there's reason saw first post-trial shot administered December 2020.

This. lot people realize this.  webmd. site tell headache cancer like framing social justice thing gets redditors care. simple economics makes 😴 deleted comments ""in disgrace"" ""dimed out"" **realized executive could wrong**

Clearly not. saying exact thing based single source. Buzziness booming - bees probably think Macron certainly weighed things correctly here. lockdown get, even pissed population point probably going stop following orders stalling? abundantly clear outside extraordinary lockdowns, can't eliminate COVID. even France managed it, give week someone comes across land border France COVID starts again. get paid support entire industries. think NBA game played, people getting paid players lol Sorry job loss, here’s much better days yours. Black yellow, hello!  bit better now, actually: confirmed stored +2 +8 C, month two including production phase. trying determine time safely increased allow comfortable transportation. argue 1) 3) (I think reported sequelae COVID pretty normal bad bout respiratory virus, early yet). issue 2), we're talking long shut vaccines can't stop it, mutates get around vaccine.

At point, then, learn centuries humans learn live pandemics?

If get resume normal life without kind massive death pandemics had, great. can't, history tells us deal lot death pandemic, tells us nothing consequences remaking society prevent virus ever spreading. scares me, think consequences good. Illegal immigrants (*and* legal immigrants even [citizens already reasons fear ICE.

I'd like point US citizens *aren't* generally habit carrying citizenship documentation, documentation (passport book card) actually quite slow somewhat expensive acquire. $110, think, last time checked, months.

The citizen news story actually US passport.

He got authorized-persons-only part hospital (and might patient) accused setting fire. Arrested charges trespassing tampering fire alarm, far tell news stories, arson case develop enough evidence. 

Without enough evidence hold Ramos-Gomez local police decided call FBI ICE. Criminal mischief maybe-probably setting small fire sprinklered building. 

And despite authenticity passport citizenship, ICE took custody started deportation proceedings.

So totally understand people, especially members profiled minorities, skittish around government activities. Even legal, *proving* huge hassle. every day police Feds lose $190k case. time waste couple hours days get lame apology. Considering variation data country etc, hard give decisive evidence CFR one stable metrics death terribly subjective thing considering ""estimates"" underdiagnosis... Comparing CFRs 20 somethings 40 somethings, 40 somethings roughly double risk death. around 40 person's immune system starts weakening significantly age.

At age 40 CFR still levels worrying much death sick though. significant risk needing hospitalization long recoveries negatively impact one's career right peak earning years though. plagued ongoing fatigue politician known energy wants means.

I'm saying blowing risk like someone someone 20s bit... something. People 40s keep telling selves invincible 20 something like denial aged. Get guys, invincible anymore, 20 somethings either least bodies resilient enough justify sentiment. one department infected, thankfully, recently I’m still battling it. changed mind vaccine. 
I want get vaccinated completely recover. American here, confirm dicking around! people think pandemic real minority, even among conservatives. much common viewpoint pandemic overblown measures harm good.  Also vulnerable people getting vaccinated month now. I'm aware vaccines got licensed like unlikely Hey! It’s me, Robot Fauci. AMA!  groundhog predicted 6 weeks winter! going awesome. love winter season far :) real answer scientists know. Even Kent variant they're difficult time deciding higher mortality rate not. Otoh, Brazilian variant seems driving force overrunning hospitals Manaus, town Amazon thought achieved herd immunity First Wave.

But 2nd point whether scaremongering not, really depends whether who've covid taking bigger risks re-socializing others. Personally, can't really say since know handful who've gotten infected &amp; recovered (and social behavior seems mirror broader community), maybe varies state state. national mandate would incredibly unconstitutional huge overstep power.

Agree 100% also got around 14 mill vaccinated now, may one first western countries eradicate like telling people need hear push vaccinations get this. Every vaccine bought EU produced EU. EU countries produce supplies. can't travel anywhere summer.

Looking Europe though, none countries exactly ready travel summer anyway. negative effects masks? keep stating haven’t said are. Defense Production Act utilized. Getting first shot today along elderly parents.
I don’t even know process feelings. Isnt j&amp;j 61% effective though? much antivaxxers Europe Russia. reassuring 3 month wait seem affect efficacy vaccine. got given first dose AstraZeneca vaccine Sunday concerned wait next dose long. Without vaccine im expected die catch covid need effective possible, case catch post vaccine.


I'll sleep little better tonight knowing 3 month wait make vaccine less effective, that's mind since Sunday. thank posting this. Whole uk? approve children? vaccines eliminating death serious illness wonderful news I'd really like know get vaccine still get covid lead lasting damage. read people symptoms type lasting organ damage. would great know vaccines prevent that. We're celebrating finally vaccinated higher number infected - that's something depressing celebrate.

There's like three countries say  ""The AZ vaccine tastes bad!""

""Yes, portions small!""  Fauci advocated permanent masking social distancing? 62% time get 38% time mild cold, inject veins right I'll go life.

I right beside getting shot, ""mild cold"" 38% people develop contagious. means vaccine never effective developing herd immunity protect people conditions mean can't get vaccinated. second dose probably improve percentage, looks like virus never going stop circulating around population fairly high level.

Smallpox eradicated, polio eradicated places, things long term antibody response, like measles, quite rare developed countries. Covid may become mild vaccinated people, look like ever rare. term means virus neutralized mucosal membranes never invades cells replicates.

It therefore detectable via rtPCR strongest immunity human body produces prevent transmission certainty happens.

It unlikely human body produces sterilizing immunity SARS-CoV-2 since mucosal surfaces ACE2 receptors cells never get infected virus vaccine.

Vaccines generally unlikely produce true sterilizing immunity. sterilizing immunity even goal.

You're confusing effects term definition term. Less chances fuck ups shenanigans go directly pharmacies rather states pharmacies. Cuts middle man shipping, deliveries go little quicker

Also, there's still question missing doses went, feds know directly doses went. harder swindle lose track doses. States lost vote confidence there. set boundary somehow seems pessimistic forecast vaccine supply.  J&amp;J 100 million June Moderna Pfizer works another 100 million people.  almost whole adult population.

By April May AstraZeneca Novavax approved. basically little chance aren’t general public May. currently eligible population estimated 225 million.  

Given three unapproved released data authorized elsewhere seems reasonable get approval. numbers also don’t assume Moderna Pfizer beating committed targets.

I think state official point claiming won’t starting general public August assuming two current vaccines supplied improve capacity assumptions incredibly conservative. 7 day average daily cases 100k fewer peak 7 day average daily cases Jan 9th, definitely making progress. Damn, ordered 25 tests 4.7€ piece Austria. today death count 454,712 prediction model little wrong.  difficult, knowledge nobody approaches research way. looked things like rate decline viable virus various surfaces, concentration air virus without various measures, rate decline infectiousness airborne virus also viral concentration air, infectivity virus various physical forms (droplets various sizes, etc) delivered animal models, probably things come immediately mind. 

In end various approaches looked judged reliability (results vary study study) importantly light *respiratory* virus. touch surface virus attack cells finger , finger fall off. make way respiratory tract (don't fingers) best. 

So, right person X develops disease person places W one can't say categorically dogmatically X caught either air surface place P. infectious disease looking probabilities statistics. present studied led consensus airborne route far important. route route greatest importance route deserves attention. essence author article saying, I've added mass words it.

Absolutely. I'll wear mask respect/if mandated, I'm vaccinated I'm going bars, concerts (if exist), seeing family, traveling, etc. I'm someone prefers restrictions I'll adapt them, I'm going back normal+masks (if mandated/still social norm).

Have feeling I'm alone opinion. gotta assume US surges ahead vaccinations, Canada benefit that. Surely getting number one trading partner back online would priority. government said Canadians September, figured would promise deliver. News like makes think we'll earlier too.

Most vaccines produced go straight distribution. Even assume 200 million doses produced far (and probably much less), distributed every country earth, one would vaccinate even 3% population. Far little speak slowing virus.

So think bigger problem production capacity. doubt anything whatsoever profession itself. know someone going 7 months without taste smell. don’t think it’s alarmist say don’t know long symptom last. EU page. summer, 70% more. Could better, still great. ramping production fantastic Curevac Sanofi-GSK behind. wore 2 masks shopping week pain. 1 kept moving around staying right, consistently adjust kept touching masks. wonder making things worse end day.

Obviously 2 well fitted masks better grabbed had... California, study was, highest Hispanics, often live crowded housing situations. That's probably main factor. Read again... Ok, may found problem here: know term ""per capita"" means?

Because 2.2 million US deaths slightly lower per capita death rate 675,000 US deaths 1918. again, counting mitigation efforts 1918 NONE now. Newly discovered California variant could reason California experienced rough surge: “The gross domestic product (GDP) California 3.14 trillion U.S. dollars 2019, meaning contributed state country’s GDP year.”

First, California failed state economically. It’s US’s largest GDP. Florida 4th. matter what, state take California’s place. Everyone wants California fail...but Californians keep nation going. Florida wishes could state.

Eh. Debatable. Yes, that’s great point. far working dogs go, think won’t permanently damaged. think like us. We’re shape little awkward, shake emerge pandemic. 

The dogs, like us, simply need practice. bounce back. Working literally DNA, right? *want* get back shape. Maybe money reintegration training, that’s thing. Ive seen countless posts page last weeks claiming take Pfizer Moderna Oxford vaccine useless.

Never ever think would see vaccine snobbery American here, already talks delaying second shot Pfizer Moderna order get people partial protection. know offered one shot J&amp;J vaccine take it. Pfizer one better doesn’t mean AZ one isn’t good   Yes, would make sense country best genomic surveillance world might able detect... 11 cases. 
I’m scientist don’t wanna get things don’t understand appears one happened result natural selection. Meaning amount travel restriction going save another nation fate. I'm going say Trudeau's efforts flawless. calling Sanofi's GSK's facilities co-opted government produce COVID vaccines. NRC facility construction while, exactly proactive. needed vaccine worth producing home soil appropriate facilities. AZ vaccine's trial bungled caused FDA Health Canada grant approval. Novavax looks solid data non-mRNA vaccine NRC facility equipped for. 

Precision NanoSystems previously given grant money create vaccine manufacturing capacity I'm guess Pfizer/Moderna wanted upgrades recent inspection allow production vaccines their, hence grant today retrofit.

We want go faster, facilities produce vaccines appear snap finger. used capacity AZ J&amp;J moved facilities away long time ago. well Israel's health minister stated:

“We see cases people returned abroad became infected vaccinated...""

There's large community Jews S. Africa think that's big worry. light end tunnel, it’s long idiotic downplay this. 2020, people critical thinking skills acting abundance caution. we’re vaccinating, people see media’s COVID porn unnecessary good snapshot state affairs. don’t get it. literally can’t wait turn finally go visit parents. Glad you’re getting yours! California getting burned emergence California Variant: CAL.20C.

Russian vaccine example far better Oxford/AZ’s US government rn focusing believe 200mil vaccines doses solve problem Better marketing department likely moderna pfizer, 200 million people end June. 260m qualify 2. also know everyone take it.

So want vaccine, youll get beginning summer earlier. 

Plus, ya know, J&amp;J likely come soon here. 3 vaccines currently approved UK, (even better ones) way Everybody going lots traffic lockdown. “Please always remember, tomorrow good day,” Moore said interview walk, uttering words became trademark. UK, Italy, Spain, Germany, much Europe exercise rational thinking basic compassion, correct? Otherwise would kept case numbers control death numbers minimal like NZ Australia. getting numbers back control vaccinations. lock working.

Sorry hear vaccine rollout subpar forced still rely lockdowns foreseeable future! Hopefully rollout significantly improves soon Europe! reduction asymptomatic cases, think that's huge deal.

There seems 50-65% reduction overall PCR positivity, transmission still reduced somewhat. world. people wanna live like that, good luck guess won’t participating. cases reinfections less severe original infection. biggest issue people become part transmission chains thus increasing viral transmission diminishing herd effects.

🥱 USA genomic testing, would probably find USA variants. flying blind.

The testing known variants may uncover new variants.  Fact check: COVID-19 pandemic orchestrated pharmaceutical companies, investment groups philanthropists

A Facebook post suggesting pharmaceutical companies, global investment groups billionaire philanthropists conspired bring COVID-19 pandemic shared online.

The post claims links organisations invites readers consider proof conspiracy. ends sentence: “Now understand dead bat sold wet market China infected ENTIRE PLANET” (here, here, here, here).

Many claims appeared similar posts debunked Reuters (here) fact checkers (here here) December 2020.

The claims roughly split two themes, first focussing pandemic’s origins Wuhan second highlighting spurious links global organisations.

The Wuhan laboratory

“The virus started biological laboratory Wuhan”

No evidence. Unverified theories suggested virus causes COVID-19 synthesised Wuhan Institute Virology (here). However, time publication, majority virologists infectious disease experts say new virus likely evolved naturally. extensive Reuters report examining origins COVID-19 read .

“Winterthur built Chinese laboratory Wuhan”

False. Winterthur Swiss insurance company bought AXA, French insurance company, 2006 (here). construction company nothing link building Wuhan Institute Virology, originally founded 1956 Chinese national institution (here).

“The Chinese biological laboratory Wuhan funded Glaxosmithkline”

False. Wuhan Institute Virology funded British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). institute part Chinese Academy Sciences (CAS) (here), governed State Council People’s Republic China (here). 2019, CAS member wrote open letter (here) maintaining academy’s funding split equally Chinese government ‘competitive funding technology transfer’. Institute’s partners listed website (here).

“The biological laboratory Wuhan funded Dr. Fauci”

Misleading. Anthony Fauci Director US National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since 1984 (here). NIAID part National Institutes Health (NIH), agency US health department (here).

The NIH confirmed Reuters email granted $3.4million non-profit organisation EcoHealth Alliance Inc 6 years fund research understanding bat coronavirus emergence. non-profit awarded money Wuhan Institute Virology, alongside East China Normal University (Shanghai), Institute Pathogen Biology (Beijing), Duke-NUS Medical School (Singapore).

US government websites show Wuhan institute received $814,608 2015 2019 (here, switch “Prime Awards” “Sub-Awards” upper right corner). spokesperson added grant EcoHealth Alliance terminated April 24, 2020 reinstated July 8, 2020.

A decision Trump administration cut EcoHealth Alliance funding reported Politico April obtaining emails EcoHealth Alliance NIH (here).

The NIH website shows reinstated budget run June 2021 (here), EcoHealth Alliance wrote August NIH imposed “impossible irrelevant conditions effectively block us continuing critical work”.

It US government funds Wuhan institute: European Union stated Jan. 26, 2021 awarded grants laboratory since 2015. added institute: “delivered first SARS-Cov2 genome sequence, enabled partners European Virus Archive design widely used polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) diagnostic test COVID-19” (here).

Pharmaceutical companies, investment groups philanthropists

Pfizer

“Glaxosmithkline Pfizer!”

False. GSK embarked joint ventures Pfizer, two separate companies (here here). fact, Pfizer one owner, owned members public range institutions, top shareholder Vanguard Group (here)

“Bill Gates shareholder Pfizer”

True, time publication. outlined above, Pfizer many shareholders. Bill Melinda Gates Foundation owned Pfizer stocks since 2002 (here here) 2019 tax return Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust lists Pfizer among corporate investments (here , see see Foundation Trust annual tax return 2019). foundation also provided research grants company (here).

BlackRock

“GlaxoSmithKline managed Black Rock finances”

Misleading. BlackRock, world’s largest asset management firm, owns 7.5% GSK (fintel.io/so/us/gsk/blackrock) time publication largest shareholder (here). mean GSK “managed” BlackRock, GSK 1553 institutional owners shareholders (fintel.io/so/us/gsk).

“Black Rock also major share-holder MICROSOFT, property Bill Gates”

Misleading. BlackRock second largest shareholder Microsoft time publication (here) Microsoft property Bill Gates. 2014, media outlets reported Gates eclipsed Microsoft’s largest individual shareholder company’s former CEO, Steve Ballmer (here).

When Gates stepped Microsoft’s board 2020, news reports said owned 1.3% company’s shares (here here).

“Vanguard shareholder Black Rock”

True. Vanguard, another global investment company, top shareholder BlackRock time publication (here).

“Black Rock controls central banks”

False. US central bank hired BlackRock March 2020 manage commercial mortgage-backed securities effort shore economy (here). means BlackRock assists Federal Reserve, control it.

George Soros Winterthur

“Black Rock manage finances Open Foundation Company (SorosFoundation)”

False. Open Society Foundations world’s largest private funder charities non-governmental organisation (here) owned funded billionaire George Soros (here). foundation connection BlackRock.

Soros Fund Management, however, investment fund run Soros shares BlackRock (here), sold 2020 (here).

“The SorosFoundation serves French AXA”

False. evidence connection Open Society Foundations French insurance company AXA (here). However, financial research website Fintel recorded last year Soros Fund Management disclosed ownership 450,000 shares AXA Equitable Holdings (here), US-based company (here) partially owned French AXA (here).

“Soros owns German company Winterthur”

False. Winterthur Swiss insurer (here) bought AXA 2006 (here).

“Winterthur built German Allianz”

False. Winterthur Allianz insurance companies, connection International Commission Holocaust Era Insurance (ICHEIC), non-profit association founded 1998 US insurance regulators representatives Israel settle outstanding life insurance policies Nazi era.

The ICHEIC’s website states negotiations led settlements AXA France Winterthur Switzerland (here) Allianz’s website says German industry accepted responsibility involvement German companies Nazi regime (here). connection may explain Allianz, AXA Winterthur mentioned social media post.

“Vanguard shareholder German Allianz”

True. Vanguard second largest shareholder Allianz (here).

VERDICT

False. post claims reveal links origins coronavirus pandemic, pharmaceutical companies involved COVID-19 vaccine research, global investment groups billionaire philanthropists George Soros Bill Gates. implies connections, many fabricated misleading, evidence pandemic deliberately orchestrated. evidence support this, virus created laboratory.

This article produced Reuters Fact Check team. Read fact-checking work here. think he'd covid tested get pneumonia first place, would come back positive covid caused get it. swear subreddit distrustful russian vaccine months ago problem variants ""starting circulate."" likely months. deaths going still. British report yesterday seemed indicate non-VOC (variant concern) mortality risk 1 VOC risk 1.65...suggesting (I’m sure includes reinfection) 65% higher mortalities new variants. Updated 26 January 2021 include new data. matched cohort study undertaken SGTF non-SGTF cases, matching based 10-year age bands, sex, week test lower-tier local authority. 92,207 SGTF cases equal number corresponding comparators included matched cohort (n = 184,414). 28 day case fatality risk calculated SGTF non-SGTF cases. Initial analysis completed 8 January 2021; 14,939 SGTF cases 15,555 comparators least 28 days specimen date study period end date. 25 deaths (0.17%) SGTF cases 26 deaths (0.17%) comparators (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.58 – 1.73). 19/01/2021, updated linkage deaths data matched cohort provided increased time follow- ascertainment deaths identified 65 deaths among non-SGTF cases (0.1%) 104 deaths among SGTF cases (0.2%), within 28 days specimen date. this, risk ratio increased 1.65 (95%CI 1.21-2.25). ignore reality evidence, absolutely correct agree need shift spreaders point. Honestly I'm jealous law makers this, many ways isolate different populations create priority tiers. Maybe score based system factors like job, age, health, weight, location etc. could try consider risk spreading risk death intersectionally optimise outcomes. maybe one statisticians scientists! get 82% efficiency. thought 92% 1.5 dose regimen UK/EU rejected went full 2 dose regimen 62% efficient. not, report EMA receiving EMA confirmed meeting Russian vaccine’s developer took place Tuesday “to discuss development plan engagement EMA noted statement “currently Sputnik V undergoing rolling communicate start rolling review procedure,” Herd immunity correct option day one. 

We repeatedly seen nearly impossible reach herd immunity widespread infections. We've suspected many countries level herd immunity, see huge spike cases.

Herd immunity *through vaccines* correct option day one. goal mitigate spread virus minimize hospitalizations deaths vaccine rollout began became option could actually choose. Rip getting sick. got rona yet fingers crossed. makes incredibly sad. Thank kind sir. true hero. ""new normal"" big business considering ditching real estate save money. they'll talk dip productivity makes fed enough head back.

It looks like potential post-law school job give people option, bet ass opting working office again

But that's extent ""new normal"". everything else return normal even businesses considering allowing employees work home indefinitely want absolutely everything else normal  Oh you’re trouble! shows low life since can’t civil conversation resort personal attacks. less I’m at. post-vaccination waiting period over, I’m done anything that’s legally imposed me. wife bit catching eating favorite restaurants. giving it, timescale recommended ""On box"" speak.  don’t know yet. far, signs good, we're looking little year viral evolution human populations. That’s FAR short draw conclusions from. Let know you’re done temper tantrum sweetheart say herd immunity, mean partial immunity among population likely exposed. huge chunk people go church, eat out, parties, work front like jobs etc might ready it, giving herd immunity among sub-groups. words, relatively small percentage population accounts spread. think there's herd immunity among work form home shut-ins like me. It’s simply changing cloths different geological places time.

All Brazilian variant, African variant BULLSHIT, it’s beast get ready vaccines going become expensive. Hard think two related. 

But even aren’t, good look.  evidence slightly less effective

Pfizer's tested full set mutations. so? one them. think COVID hoax conspiracy. can't deny normal vaccine process rushed long-term studies. cases allegeric reactions. SO, skepticism nothing loonies think Bill Gates putting chip head altering DNA, think tad cautious unwarranted. Ages? really. week, according article. It’s entirely possible covid related (also possible wasn’t). knows. NEVER LOCKDOWN. TAIWAN'S STRATEGY BASED AROUND FINDING CASES QUARANTINING BORDER CONTROLS. 

Don't mean yell, amount people know nothing Taiwan's mitigation methods infuriating. Taiwan poster child effectively mitigate COVID without internal lockdown, Sweden. Hey thanks finding that. see anything else please let know! Again, state fact something don’t appear data say. “statistically significant data single case you’re suggesting”? know mildly infected even tracked problems? 

I don’t data. you? 

I don’t know you, people trying push low efficacy vaccine offered excellent vaccines. university employees work infectious diseases, example. want have, I’m willing wait.   Immunity vector factored dosing regimen, done J&amp;J vaccine. know viral vector based vaccine producers used strategy, efficacy J&amp;J vaccine reduced immune response vector. ""dose through"" giving higher titre dose. Worst country. Hogan joke

Kids gonna go 2 years without classroom. Horrid That's pretty solid pasta tbh Probably seriously unhealthy begin with, eating food around day. Greasy diner food diet = systemic inflammation, heart disease, myriad comorbidities increase risks COVID death. virus sucks. amazing life led. Hopefully reunited wife.

My sincere condolences Sir Tom’s family. Thank God absolutely herd immunity. random ass virus doesn’t spread quickly enough build herd immunity it’s statistically prolific nothing anything. Source claim? try fight misinformation whenever see it. It’s tiring it’s right thing do. Russian word Victory starts English equivalent P (pobeda), hard take claim seriously. like claiming V COVID stands ""thermonuclear"". world lost exceptional human being. people say hate government people/country, believe them. great news developing world Reddit large from. Awwww. makes sad. loved fact tried something help, even advanced age, made tangible inspirational contribution effort. Two wrongs don’t make right. People wore masks social distanced 1918, too. 

The difference today's medical advances, 1918 flu deadly. enough vaccinate every adult right? 12+ trials still happening 18+ that’s eligible believe. 200MIL + doses already including Moderna must cover us right?? Rightttttt?? answer likely we're sure, might well skip tonight safe Ohhhhhh spooky Reddit police. I'm much trouble lmao. Faces best typing papers. Please use fingers. 

Seriously though, sending mom hug “you it!” beer..."" know vaccines cases plummeting? plummet summer without vaccines? India without vaccines?

Still happy drop cases, curious degree attributable vaccines. Oh come on, know places people go 8pm form social gatherings. 

And walk, walk 8pm. fighting heard?

They daily coverage. 

The millions people Covid respiratory infection resulted long term symptoms? people fought heard. didn’t get daily news stories them. didn’t get special clinics them. 

What get?

They got doctors telling it’s head. Moderna/Pfizer better clinical results amazing real world results Israel. think approach definitely best approach given efficacy numbers. don’t buy strains led less efficacy given us trial J&amp;J saw 20 percent reduction efficacy preventing infection. strains really resistant Pfizer would probably see evidence Israel not. don’t see wouldn’t want people vaccine know effective. Like said think need let people decide vaccine want people want one shot regions J&amp;J preferable logistical reasons. plan segment vaccine types population stupid doomed fail imo. want work treat blacks monolith. [Ok go. findings studying studies effects Tuskegee experiment belief anti vaccine conspiracy part whole. Also note explains vaccine acceptance black community goes income education go up. Amazing life, great man sympathies family. good idea went Barbados? soon saw going China, like uh oh. Shit go down.

The whole month February surreal watching everyone walk around clue way.

My friends thought come even big deal.

I definitely reacted degree severity virus overreact disruption would cause daily lives.

Nobody believed said going really really bad. Facebook friend asking vaccine elderly parent, someone chimed in, paraphrased, ""Don't take it! Hank Aaron died taking vaccine!"" I'm debating whether chime smack nonsense, grit teeth keep scrolling. Gosh, misinformation stupidity people... NY Times came article complaining even calling experts downplaying efficacy vaccines. collectively accept goal totally eliminate COVID-19, rather use vaccines reduce threat level flu, threat variants lot less worrying. Head on. Apply directly forehead! Heh.. well least know hold human life high regard. even math?

Interesting facts:
Most obesity self inflicted product environment.
Smoking self inflicted addiction fed environment

Any death loss someone, respect someone lost part ibviously..

BrAiNwAsHeD, aMi RiTe Br0¿

Dumb flat earthers... Smh J&amp;J based Ad26 based vaccine, dosing regimen higher potential anti-adenoviral vector directed immune response. taken account immune system recognize covid spike well vector, dose higher (""dosing through""). way, booster shot 2 dose regimen still underway, still trigger additional response spike protein. Source: Mathai Mammen (J&amp;J global head R&amp;D). Yeah. That’s doom gloom evolving fast trash. going many ways virus change spike benefits it. isn’t flu virus administered case numbers correct, already 10% US population vaccinated include vulnerable. know change fact everyone else spread virus still. average 1.5 million vaccinations day, theoretically everyone 16+ able vaccine summer. many people trouble reading comprehension. “Could” means it’s possible, usually certain factors play certain way. “Estimate” means best guess, inherently uncertain. weatherman says 50% chance rain, weather app going show rain showers. doesn’t rain day, weather man wasn’t wrong, like guy wasn’t wrong. Period. Number people **currently** infected correlated many people currently vaccinated.

Eventually see drop infections vaccinate LOT people, nowhere close that, 1% us population fully vaccinated. cannot make dent infections.  Palace said Queen sending private message condolence family Capt Sir Tom. Army veteran, originally Keighley West Yorkshire, came prominence walking 100 laps garden Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire, 100th birthday first national lockdown. Capt Sir Tom joined Army beginning World War Two, serving India Myanmar, known Burma. Eh, assumed referring comparison professions based title. think going comparing ""line cooks"" age groups racial identities something.

And read article commenting confirmed suspicions. don’t know desperate are, reached point vaccinated infected I’m putting life hold years find 10% chance diminished lung capacity eight months get COVID. would like so, go it. + amount af vaccines distributed amount cases? suspiciously good news. ...according Russian scientists. trust much believe China 8k Covid deaths. Would idiots shut fuck up?!?! exhausting even think stupidity. decide best ignore them?  hold promises everyone, 16+ least, able access vaccine summer. Hopefully trials go well children they'll able get vaccinated school starts fall well. really issue.

I hope open things soon everyone chance get vaccination. say ""chance"" people refuse that's problem. least give everyone chance going full bore open doors everywhere. federal government also pushing special syringes needed extract 6th (which probably accounts much increase). read 60% access syringe. suckers fancy names. bad definition fancy fucked. naturally introverted person, primary thing bothering me. good hot food. care stuck home almost entire past 12 months. logic makes sense see repeated blindly sub constantly. look age breakdown us probably 30-35% population age 50 100 million people. know probably 60-80 million actually want vaccine. Moderna Pfizer promised deliver 200 million doses end March. Meaning 200 million doses vaccine deliver June wouldn’t go anyone plan. plan makes zero sense. top J&amp;J going approved right away likely won’t see doses till April. try prioritize doses based age run log jam distribution. Get vaccines peoples arms. Adding complications like segmenting vaccines slow process. we’re going prioritize J&amp;J anything hard reach places lack EXACTLY. told 30 millions people US received vaccine, handful hospitalized allergic reaction. Meanwhile, 20 million gotten COVID 400,000 dead millions hospitalized. shocked 7 allergic reaction... 100M doses Q2 would put EU way plans Pfizer AstraZeneca published problems production. EMA reviewing it, date approval yet? right swing fists ends nose.

People right go around recklessly physically injuring people. math checks out. Max 12% population vaccinated mid spring, probably close 30% level natural immunity. leaves plenty room new strains spread faster find hosts real damage. Hopefully age prioritization vaccines minimizes deaths large degree. Osterholm right everything said far. Forever ever. said shot available stage over-60s workers disabilities

I guess shouldn’t surprised country that’s 90% expats (Dubai even moreso), Emiratis get priority. We’re talking people 30’s. 1% 300 million. 

Lol i’m sure freak badly deaths caused obesity smoking 😂 brainwashed US part Covax program. extra vaccines donated parts world. 

The US hedging bets bought hundreds millions doses various vaccine producers. describing EU? Germany? pleases person wanting visit USA :D Eh, tasteless commodity obtained years anglophilic tendencies developed Russian Empire. Sticked us modern age, lol. Frankly flat wrong. Thanks man, appreciate twice many lot faster getting milestone. Yeah, get paid worse others, said underpaid. Agreed. need clarity strategy messaging. problem year. priority list ""best"" makes sense, shoring availability others makes sense. May vary county/state. county, provide either proof residence work county. ID, pay stub, bill name, etc. think better analogy would compare reckless biohazard flu season, rather comparing drunk driver.

Being reckless biohazard potential kill lot individuals drunk driving does. know Covid does? could also inaudible word, no? Whatever say, Charles ""Ai Ai Ai"" Spain.  However true point may Europe USA lied, different less constant consistent basis, doesn’t really change OPs point Russia lies lot. Like... elections, people assassinate try to, cheating Olympics, planes shot down... it’s perfectly reasonable skeptical governments claims, also perfectly reasonable trust claims something verified independently like vaccine results.

To clear I’d expect many countries trust results claimed Trump administration, given speed run lies, without seeing verification independent sources. think lot us waiting see countries approve vaccines concern regulatory bodies would pressured “look good” leading election. Yes, getting blood pressure (and sugar) help. Doc checked VV syncope said ignore advice relax keep blood moving flexing leg muscles (not arm injection happening, though - makes harder give shot). That’s probably state-by-state call terms residency requirements remember residency =/= citizenship (e.g., need U.S. address SSN). UK adequate ethics boards monitoring/auditing capabilities?

I opinion. think UK absolutely leading way pandemic. explained description approval process US would imply. FDA announced indicated would approve AZ's vaccine solely done UK?

AZ's Phase III trial results published ago there's still talk approval based US literally conducting clinical trials vaccine speak. *kind* *of* answer question - Dr Anthony Fauci said waiting clinical trials US finalize.  No, read article. clicked link different fear-mongering headline content yesterday. understand recruiting big cities, like Los Angeles, NYC San Francisco? would filled quickly, would think. called months back teen, said think could accept area. Seems silly, no? Unfortunately, title click bait. nations exercised rational thinking basic compassion kept case numbers control death numbers minimal.

So UK, Italy, Spain exercise rational thinking basic compassion? Hear cry millions New Zealanders Aussies mourning death individual rights? 

I'm sure countries natural advantages two nations did, would seen success stories. actually can't help think death rate COVID-19 -- low single digit percentages -- worst could happen. One magnitude lower, could feasible achieve herd immunity without overwhelming hospitals. One magnitude higher, people would scared shitless complain ""personal freedoms"".

But are, stuck twilight zone millions died, yet people look around say ""Hey, affecting me, even does, I'll fine. know fuss about"".

The disjoint viewpoints shockingly wide. called convergent evolution slowly starting see light end tunnel? know late?

This mutation B117 variant.

What's actually concerning would least second unique time E484K mutation occurred possibly more.

So could happened B117 variant multiple times across globe. patently false. economy whole fine, growing. Employment down, yes, nothing close even 2010 much less great depression.

For refresher, unemployment hovered around 10% year form 2008-2010. Currently around 6%. current government also place less 2 weeks given plans, tracking system, numbers it. caused unnecessary slowdown still trying figure actually happening. lack smooth transition hurt vaccination efforts, something people warning weeks.

We're going see larger role federal government, hopefully streamline efforts instead 50 different things happening. think US recover well point, UK well. Things hopefully slowly get back ""normal"" year goes on. problem virus continues rage throughout rest world, chance virus mutation among nations yet even see light day vaccination scares most.

This really get world vaccinated, completely isolate countries reached herd immunity yet. that's another entire bag political worms. International travel sketchy time come, believe.

Not mention recovering millions unemployed many homeless and/or completely broke disease. Jokes dumbass. admitted indeed lie. grow father? acting like he's replacement. Wow lmfao trumps office worst every 10 days biden starting drop everywhere US. Sounds like bunch bullshit me. mean, they’re common use plenty places don’t speak ancient Roman. native Roman speaker?  Nothing article says anything black person’s willingness get vaccine hold college degree. fact it’s entirely based anecdotes one family says Tuskegee experiment important cornerstone anti vaccine conspiracy theories. doesn’t talk 42% blacks willing get vaccine all. learn nothing don’t hold conspiracy theorist views vaccines. 

Please show study, real study article, breakdown vaccine acceptance college degree race income race. hope right. I'm repeating what's said there. No, that’s research development works remains seen. Olympics tough sheer number countries involved. Positivity help us virus. abundance caution will. I’ve done thing recently. Knowing close yet far lot handle sometimes. sit back think much ive lost unpredictable future start freak out. It’s hard keep hope going sometimes. find going outside safely getting sun exercise people watching really helps. try safe stay inside due covid really helps getting knowing life still moving forward still cool things happening every day. Going runs, journaling outdoors coffee shop, taking little picnics.. ways ground Deadlier old ill people? infected

Yeah, well - happens get back me.

We yet.

Rights connection completed vaccinations infections. 100 I'd drinking whiskey smoking cigars day. Preferably front open fire. Oh great! need work resume saw one scientific opinion article actually good thing mutation keeps spontaneously arising suggests there's level predictability mutations would make easily overcome tweaked vaccines. still get sniffles time. I'm convinced allergies. I've suspected before, prove stayed home. suppose next year I'll sick days allergy again.  second paragraph, you’re saying people refuses take vaccine voluntarily, going “faces eaten leopards” meaning don’t take it, they’re gonna learn hard way? wanna see clarification due fact saw antivaxxers shut vaccine clinic Dodgers stadium LA past Saturday. Well don’t see anyone saying virus would evolve lethal; knowledge would run contrary evolutionary norms Im sure viruses similar covid done 

I think probably meant virus comes back vaccines effective, spend another two years others developed distributed although think that, doesn’t make much sense since vaccines already offer signifiant immunity symptomatic infection (~60%) total protection death severe cases boosters developed speak Cases peaked right New Years dropping since. Deaths lagging indicator.  People looking summer reasonable pivot point. 
Harsh truth: we’re keeping whether means masks, distancing, stadiums, theaters, etc people can’t get vaccine. That’s societies work. burden shifts personal responsibility point. weird randos like stalking online? I’m living like decades... I’ll take risk live full life die, whatever may causes that. process hit brick wall trying vaccinate half anti vaxxer! There's more, early days, much changed since. 

Surface transmission impossible, nothing worry about. Same. faint fasting bloodwork every time I’m laying down, enough piercings tattoos prove I’m afraid needles. Food lots water help circumstances. Stupid vasovagal syncope. 😓  can’t track it’s widespread fine appears. Although still struggling, won’t link studies children pages found trying find one it’s sad. Yeah shit. major variants E484K - care past immunity had. Fauci one fireside chat sessions give average American's rundown seriousness mild/severe illness. baffles year people still blind fact know damage lungs reversible not. pisses off. No. It’s Roman numerals. According projection, may start hitting herd immunity threshold US summer, likely start seeing dramatic drop deaths next month vaccinated enough people risk death, primarily 65+ that's slightly ambiguous I'll take it. Reassuring know. really surprised. used work Kroger (worked 9 years, quit pandemic). they've always been. friends mine still work said back May/June Kroger going force employees ""weren't supposed"" receive hero pay, pay back. happen thankfully.

I lot stories could tell. union great either. experience mostly negative.  That’s pretty decent turn around eliminate facts average changing weekly. brings us June statistic flat line. major stadiums taking mass amounts recipients pop areas built, lets cross fingers normal summer! think EU creating delays Japan receiving life-saving vaccine American firm order stop something never happened never happen ""completely fair""? need protect tourism industry, big part economy Italy Spain.

So, like said start, exercise rational thinking basic good. Frankly, would dead live American health insurance system.

Essential Tremor.  stuff I've paid 7% monthly salary coverage co-pays 5 euros drugs might need.

Wow, sorry hear went that, good hear covered.

Hopefully superior healthcare system gets act together starts vaccinating people, rather forcing people stay indoors even longer. understanding, multiple types vaccines, replicated ""spike.""

Welcome back life dude Totally weird. Goes show easy is, though, even big one. alarmist it’s extremely anecdotal rare regained couple months. headlines articles alarmist frame situation “if get covid lose taste smell good” like hunger games. Yeah thats great, expect similar results J&amp;J vaccine I’ve lived California whole life - I’m entitled opinion state state are. see money going door never seeing fruits it. beautiful place love weather. feel horribly mismanaged. say first second shot, given long interval second shot raised efficacy 76% 82%, guess really matter. would seem vast majority cases vaccine provides symptomatic protection, also prevents transmission.

I say, though, AZ/Oxford jab still real odd duck. waiting 12 weeks jabs increased final efficacy (single shot) 76% 82%, interval shortened 6 weeks, efficacy went **down** 55%, even lower second all. seems really weird; look studies that. Also, linear progression 6 12 week efficacy, means getting second shot even bit early might better getting (unclear long term, though). Exactly.

Like Elvis polio.

People know people, identify people got vaccine likely get vaccine.

The reason saw doctors FB showing vaccines influence families communities also get shot.

Like ICU docs wife still clinic, card show patients she’s put money mouth speak. Anybody received second dose vaccine don’t need wear masks distance 2 weeks got second dose. Yeah.

The amount protection generally increases severe result. Like J&amp;J vaccine 66% effective mild illness, 85% severe illness 100% death. However numbers change generally improve time longer since vaccination. bull   Fortunately UK developed country. likely zero. sure. discussions decisions made pandemic whether right ones light future problems years come Yo fuck true please spread information. Flu vaccines work  Leave Argentina - vaccine we've got. En français pour la flamme, le vacccin ferme la porte d'entrée, en gros le virus peut pas s'accrocher, pas de réplication, pas de maladie, pas de transmission. chez 5% des patients le vaccin ne marche pas, ils ne developeront pas les défenses faut essayer un autre vaccin.

Verify, trust. factor exacerbates spread raises chances uncontrollable spread. Add fact lot undocumented immigrants working industry means can't really go medical care even money it. 

But negative aspects job industry affect physical mental health probably main reason there's higher mortality rate occupational field opposed others. 

If people back house depend industry livelihood, destruction commercial restaurant industry due effects COVID pandemic society would great loss. FOH would actually learn work foodies would learn cook themselves. 

Obviously I'm wishing little restaurants that're run families kept family generations.

\- hopeful spring

\- (sometimes bitter)sweet summer

\- brilliant fall

\- euphoric winter need get arms everyone country. Tiers never get us there. Younger middle aged people need get vaccinated active. huge difference USA Russia. successful russian companies funded government owned oligarchy close Putin. lots controversy US, big companies agenda need synced constantly US government. kind matter many purchased, matters manufacturing them. spin half dozen manufacturing plants 6 months ago kind beyond me. get know vaccines would pan geared produce all. true. Many areas world locked once. 

The blueprint came Spanish Flu cities like San Fran locked escaped first wave largely unscathed unlike city like Boston got creamed. course, leave wide open second wave lock-down, San Fran fell victem to. 

That's we've failed time time due human behavior. Hopefully learn better ways handle pandemic. Unfortunately, every pandemic isnt same, tough put together blueprint that's universal. can’t find mention Cuomo visiting NYC. road closures past two days blizzard related.

Work even it’s much, know even they’re less effective ways still prevent severe disease death. evidence virus immunizable, hard understate massively good news is.

It's understanding viruses, HIV comes mind, either inherently unimmunizable currently technology develop vaccine for. entirely possible SARS-Cov-2 would turn one viruses, know not. Yes. know extent, yet. plan college full person semester starting fall, assuming current trends vaccinations continue. Unfortunately trended week - 1.3M doses/day 7-day moving average Jan 25th flatlined (after continuous consistent increase 250K daily doses per week since vaccine rollout began). fact moving average trended ever slightly past three days. 

In way, ""good"" thing - means got rid bottleneck distribution. early days, vaccines trouble getting distributed. distributing them, need vaccines. 

On flip side - ""bad"" sense distribution issues easier fix production issues. simply need vaccines, (at least short term) clearly delivery bottleneck holding us back.

Given (overly optimistic) projections said ""20 million people [first dose] end December"" easy disappointed we're 30 million people end January flatlined curve. We'll get there, think everyone would like move quicker are. Yes!! Go Israel! It’s awesome see good data there. tell ya Fauci drives crazy. makes statements like without supporting facts data, he's supposed scientist. thing warnings pessimism well. Like predicting humans stop shaking hands.

Why spokesperson? people listen him? advisor someone communications. read article? certainly must dreamed chinese korean studies matter since pretty clear America greatest country world.

I rather good giggle this. Hmmm would disagree you. 100% moderate severe symptoms. vaccinated doses 👏🏼are 👏🏼 good👏🏼 😂😂 Damn got stick ass. said Taiwan stopped COVID cold. say ""with lockdown"".

I talking general approach. Yes, border controls control introduction cases internally, complete approach, must measures place stop leakages. hilarious see ""vaccine connoisseur"" types pop up, never even seen vaccine efficacy % life months ago, insisting anything less 95% simply unacceptable them. ""Only purest vaccines arm! Ho hum!"" awnser question, can, should. people vaccinated better, especially high risk. still breaking news? 5 years thanks vaccines, people nervous?  Pfizer/BioNTech increasing output belgian plant EU get bigger deliveries starting week think. canada's deliveries scaled back well? (Honest question) Great post mate. Recorded cases averaged around 180k per day. Everyone gets covid obeys health advice gets covid test case documented right?

Or would agree 10m documented active cases there’s going widespread undocumented infection transmission virus. hit 300k documented there’s high chance total days actual infected us exceeded 500k

Secondly deaths. Another 100k covid deaths Jan. Hospitals hit capacity deaths causes happened. data collected lag effect however it’s documented CDC extra 50k people died Jan directly covid didn’t get care needed ie heart attack parking lot hospital beds etc. 

Either way Jan worse documented deaths Dec. need know vaccines protect long covid nasty long term problems. welcome long wish.  Let's ban sale alcohol, too. Problem solved! war thing almost affect (german) civilians though thus really comparable. denying/blocking vaccines would allow reduce corona measuerements shield populace virus cleary less (electorally) popular sending army forces middle eastern country. don’t think pushing mask you’ve fully vaccinated people vaccinated. lot places still mask mandates even don’t still wear one stores.

Progress guess. stealing legal? people vaccinated better. read article? reduction asymptomatic cases, think that's huge deal.

They said still get lung damage asymptomatic?  Border controls work, inevitable leaks quarantine sites, something Vietnam, Aus, NZ habitually experience. leaks occur, must strategies place deal it.

Vietnam long land border good smugglers human goods kind. must strategies control inevitable infiltrators got through. Yeah, makes sense, AstraZeneca tested British population. tested South Africa Brazil well. Exactly. Oxford insisted sold cost, one that's going heavy lifting many developing countries. Even reason alone, fantastic news reconfirmed they'll getting effective, cheap vaccine that's easy distribute. actually read article see published information Lancet, one renomated scientific journals field, data peer reviewed scientists different countries. God hope right. Thanks insight. game changer! Nostalgia jerking strong us Russians It’s funny Fauci become voice positivity light crazy “experts” guys coma 11 months he's probably going back ""normal"" time soon either Wonder future we’ll see headlines like “COVID-19 Survivor gets new whatever virus vaccine” Yea. hear dude. vaccines here, work, they’re already reducing hospitalizations deaths! There’s guessing predicting start work, update kind first looking long take see significant difference (enough “return normal”). become magically vaporized killed person's immune system. immunity is.

Sure, virus particles could land someone's hair something, would attacked immune system, could shed virus somewhere else infects someone. true every virus exists world lead global lockdowns.

I think people lost perspective virus. nowhere near deadly people think first contagious virus live with, first vaccine. 😞 🌹 think forecast updated daily: date little optimistic read article suggests everyone could offered first dose May. look latest AZ data earlier single dose results unbelievably good (prevents 100% hospitalizations). get everyone UK first dose May amazing position. It’s both. 20 million vaccine doses shipped states found way arms. i'm shaming getting covid, i'm shaming mayoral candidate holding in-person events pandemic. He’s advocated social distancing masking getting vaccinated  source look realistic timeline returning normal? Ideally broken phases (i.e. age groups, social restrictions, economics, etc.). can't get head around plan seems everyday there's new conflicting idea take hurdles causing called ""timeline"" skew even abandoned.

I want something semi-conservative, backed logic (and ideally sources), anything, better expert's \*guess\*.

Any suggestions?

Edit: Americas Europe focus, would like see whole world obviously. agree. glad case you. close family member works programming company. could work home resources boss type boss wants physically see come work. Compound V? according friend who's lecturer UCLA, state colleges California planning resume majority in-person classes fall, barring kind complications vaccine availability/rollout surges due mutant strains. said may occupancy restrictions even masking requirements, expectation on-campus dorms &amp; apartments regular capacity. Mind universities infrastructure institute weekly testing students/faculty/staff catch outbreaks early. Needs people stop fucking around every single clone human body increases chance escape people flippant give virus home run. took 103 million infected 3 escapes occured imagine ppl wore masks adhered correct social distancing many would escaped.  one aspect economic health. like using booming stock market justify US economy well. pretty clear genuine discussion.   Yeah, makes sense. Sadly death toll today rebounds 1400 UK, without vaccine would absolute carnage. 
It's like war, thoughts go amazing NHS, light glowing end tunnel. share price seems stable despite this.  Sure /s mean goal herd immunity, herd immunity vaccination instead actual infectious spread lot participants fell windows. good enough 64 11 month old good enough person month older? Like difference weeks going make? understand wanted cut somewhere 60s France I'd worried they're offering poor jab.  Snow? hands matter European countries might trust issues Russia? People already hate wearing ultra thin fabric ones advertised ""ultra breathable cooling"", doubt they'll able tolerate proper medical masks n95/kn95 especially winter starts winding temperatures begin rise. BTW strange lot Canadians seem fine fact Canada vaccinated 3000 people yesterday, UK 600,000 US 1.3 million.
People seem fine that. can't wrap head around it.
I mean wonder Pfizer screwed us, know anything it. joke. way I’m kind glad we’re vaccine push winter, weather sucks I’m hurry go anything million things cause lose ability function. fact minimal risk happening worth losing everything makes life worth living first place. Japan vaccination-wise? doesn’t seem like situation all. vaccine 8 months ago “herd immunity” fraction now. I’m assuming goes away overnight I’m least hopeful we’re worst. Time tell guess. would good allow teachers willing take risk teach in-person. tactically taken advantage reduced risk young, healthy people. Vaccine snobbery something expected witness year ago. Yet another pipe dream Thanks.

So better comparisasion guess would be, comparing 12 week, vaccines. Comparing two time lapse really fair. America greatest country world. greatest country reacting things immediately. Time get knocked things, time nothing stop US gets rolling (whether rolls right direction another discussion).   could work, didnt think that. 0 2, eh Fauci?  genetic lol reasons make claims. country known lying. judging funded research allowed suspicions.
Time show silly not. 
I guess days write /s every time use sarcasm. Even obvious ones can't recognized apperently. Florida UP

Calfornia Lots did, including Canada. started investment last year, late majority countries domestic production already. coming weeks US trial believe. Strange decision retrospect include 65s UK trial. Great, also get GLONASS tracked... Combination of. 

1. 25-30% people already infected. 

2. major holidays past month people comingling less. 

3. Vaccinations started ramping (small impact cases 3% people vaccinated (first dose) 2 weeks ago)

4. People generally still significantly less social this, even without formal lockdowns masks likely help too. problem surgical masks leak lot. cases less 50% air breathe filtered. One way improve fit mask use cloth mask top surgical mask. strategy significantly reduce leakage.

BUT wearing single good N95 mask properly fit tested subject always preferable. Yes. I'll protected also I'm way list get vaccinated time I'm offered one vaccinated anyway basically one scenario, right, need them.

But there's dozen scenarios wrong. Here's easily identifiable ones:

1. 16s approved June.

2. Pfizer delivers first 200M May starts putting next 100M

3. pivot double dosing strategy J&amp;J.

4. J&amp;J continues production issues.

5. One Pfizer Moderna unexpected production delays, would still hook deliver extra vaccines make difference. #1 source lobby dollars US. government works them, way around.

If hospital health insurance networks want make profit, cheaper supplies government subsidies vendors helps that. Pfizer Modernas vaccines prevent transmission covid? I'd like one refute antivax BS, I'd need help. part life already back normal seeing family going without masks. I'm vaccinated, course I'll start again. That's literally I'm getting vaccinated. Well, guess EU would help manufacture it. Yes  wasn’t point making brought end date. admit wrong move on. I'm talking specifically Manaus surge. evidence top Brazilian virologists? Pretty good news says nod space race. might help. actually happened.

Just DeSantis blamed media summer surge. Still sure long term acquire special super power collateral effect. 😥 Interesting also, Pfizer/Biontech deliver 100 mln vaccines China year. course, Europe:  depends age, profession, health status. states public health website tells when. horrible part adulthood: says, trusts, believes, ultimately matter. Take old gay lady Christian parents--letting parents independent people required *you* become independent person too. cannot control her, need to. 

If old enough get vaccine next months (16+ US), may able arrange vaccine appointment calling pediatrician's office directly (if one) saying want talk confidentially. old enough that, problem may solve itself--teens 16 probably even allowed get vaccine end year early next year.

That said, really painful see parents believing hurtful false things (see above--gay, Christian parents). Let feel pain even try talking feelings her, saying scared going get sick know believe this, want try call *her* doctor see *that person* thinks vaccine (not ""doctors"" online).

Precisely, currently countries producing (USA UK), still take vaccines foreign countries, countries produce others (EU, India, Russia, China).  Since efficacy 95% already, benefit aim for? also get exposed first second dose. Since Pfizer already optimal, better stick tested possible. Astrazeneca instead, obviously improvement 60% 82% desirable Take care yourself. hope support need. 37 million Canadians including children — wouldn’t worry much, we’ve got lot vaccine skeptics U.S. we’ll vaccine glut June.

I wonder there’s something like that’s model based real-time data ability adjust milestones/issues?  told us can’t manufacture Canada. guess happy better late never. 

Nonetheless, facility won’t running July best. whole US population vaccinated then. 

It’s good news I’m going light fireworks it. think tested. mRNA provoke immune response though. least much actual viral vector. *opinion* issue show pfizer Moderna can't prove it. scientist working pharma industry, still take everything grain salt Seems possible news sources cut stumbles long affect meaning. Oh wouldn’t try make sense downvoting. Folks downvote silliest reasons. main Chinese vaccine, sinopharm, around 79% actually mean literally received half standard dosage. yes encouraging numbers. think important point UK achieving this. Basically vaccinations speed US skipping second doses now. legitimate strategy. I'm sure would case. I'd wager anti-vaxxers would overlap ""I'd rather Russian Democrat/liberal/progressive"" crowd USA. Anti-science, anti-intellectualism, prone accepting conspiracy theories describe camps. even single way spike changes benefits it, enough vaccine resistant variant run amok updated booster created... task failed successfully uyghurs  Presented hospital bill went right back Coma. Correct agree I'm sure ship convenient place US export ban enacted vaccines purchased entities US govt, US govt ordered full US manufacturing capacity far.

As Europe, (currently) going restrict exports us Pfizer going get ahead targets. AstraZeneca another issue they're behind target. **Asking providing medical advice allowed - includes speculating dosages, supplements, active ingredients.** cannot responsible health. need general information, please refer CDC's website need specific medical advice, please contact qualified medical professional area.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Agreed. US &amp; USSR achieved great joint successes medical field despite governments’ mutual hostility Yes, course. don’t think he’s saying screw sick old. don’t need always assume least charitable interpretation someone’s comments. 

Blacks Latinos bearing brunt covid infections, hospitalisations deaths. may important you, it’s clearly something cares about. British Invasion. So, feel like read somewhere else delayed 2nd dose could also benefit Pfizer Moderna I'm sure misremembering. 

Are sources Pfizer Moderna see benefit delayed 2nd dose case know yet tested.  took four hours look silly. think/hope UK gets one round vaccs done, combined Summer see incredibly low cases, else equal. Fingers crossed. Alcohol transported containers variety locations ingested. million now. freely available anyone since couple weeks ago. Many drop-in centers malls, theaters etc interesting point. think athletes ""1A"" ""1B"" groups maybe could make exception them. including trainers staff everything would probably 30-40 thousand people. wonder worthwhile event without spectators. AZ results today show single dose provides 78% efficacy 100% reduction hospitalization. three month interval rises 84% efficacy second dose given 12 weeks later (all data 3 weeks vaccinated). 

It's pretty clear second dose hugely important, three weeks first dose already huge amount protection place people certainly ""only half vaccinated"". Gamaleya institute developed vaccine long tradition creating effective vaccines. think would rely steeling data western developements. Also Sputnik vaccine different approach Pfizer effective vaccines. #1, think crush line cutters. go gray hair nursing home residents first! Hard game :D.

For #2 sounds like classic ""punish whole class bad kid"" situation. figure people inclined lie vaccination would also along way ignoring restrictions? holding back harm good.

Also, go easy people think ""lie"" -- people legitimate reasons wary vaccinated young enough statistically low risk.  think another spike cases largely inevitable- vaccination proceed smoothly quickly enough think we'll avoid spike hospitalizations deaths Thats absurd argument. Masking public heavy lift. Asian countries done forever. sars1 ever really disappear? know mers still around. Nahh, everything fine! circumstances say comment on an interview **60 Minutes on March 8,** early stages of the novel coronavirus outbreak United States. A longer extract interview visible   (see 30-second mark).   

The interview predates CDC’s updated guidance use face coverings. **On April 3, 2020**, CDC updated previous advice recommended people wear cloth face coverings “in public settings around people outside household, especially social distancing measures difficult maintain.” huge help, thank you!  odds overcoming response trained specific spike sounded moderate, made think.

Why go two completely separate parts virus, even one sexy target? Give separate booster, half half upset immune system much.

Seems odds virus changing two distinct parts overcome response would zilch me, would sure defeat could pulled off.

And even - end 1 2 viable standalone candidates. Everything parallel test phase, basically unlimited budget - hairbrained scheme ever proposed? Guys, buy SP5. squeeze 8.4%.

🚀🚀🚀 100% effective pluto.  That's popular opinion. fucking facts talking about??? Trump administration's performance vaccine distribution unknown, reasonable extrapolate would considering performance administration course pandemic. brainwashed one blindly believe would suddenly see competency sound priorities people devoid characteristics four years. Gotta catch em Typically big sickness spikes like bad flu year overall death rate drops next year lot died worse normal sickness also likely die causes next year two.

There probably bit Covid, think effect smaller typically is. Many Covid survivors going ongoing issues put risk illnesses lower life expectancy. I'm positive across nation even people gotten Covid life expectancy lowered statistically I'm sure country become overweight less physically active. course dramatic impacts mental health everything entails.

The people trying minimize disease every step talked like short term thing hurting people already going die anyways year two (which already incredibly monstrous, heck write two years well-lived life like rounding error?) health ramifications going profoundly large negative years years. Yeah can’t take much goalpost pushing I'm glad boss takes seriously- he's saying I'll bet he's genuinely thinks it'll safe. released yesterday.

Edit: don’t feel like reading whole study, important part this:

“Interpretation: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination programmes aimed vaccinating large proportion population single dose, second dose given 3 month period effective strategy reducing disease, may optimal rollout pandemic vaccine supplies limited short term.”  said was? Airborne Ebola probably wouldn’t get bad terms pure case numbers purely would terrifying one would leave homes weeks.   we'll live covid way live flu. hard lol post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* ouch. suck big time. Woof According EMA Astrazeneca 59.5% efficacy.
I get vaccinated it, prefer get Moderna Pfizer. still need wait till autumn least.

Funny thing country decided can't give AZ elders give teachers. Yes, great idea, give least effective vaccine people contact many children school.

When turn I'll turn vaccine less 90% efficacy. first though. Here's history Germany;  ""daily new cases"". this. see second surge started? summer vacation season kids went back school. utter stupidity stupidity even work hard.

I'm aware happened Germany. But, like said start exercise rational thinking basic compassion otherwise would kept case numbers control death numbers minimal.  Nah, nothing beat american ingenuity super spreading virus. flu doesn’t mortality rate COVID. It’s also contagious. Imagine didn’t take steps mitigate impact, think would You’re concerned bars shutting down... think underlying issues need address. I’m support need it.

Stop crying  coming decision whether actually going recommended saying anything publicly it?  People Reddit likely lean scientifically artistically. sort people also likely ""miss matchers"", they'll spot flaws something rather identifying positives.

I sure fit persona, try quite hard hone positives. Whatever find, please let know! obviously viruses work like that, according Britain they've found identified B117 variants obtained E484K mutation present SA variant sequencing. Certainly possible mutation arise naturally, certainly appears advantageous change. said, SA variant variety changes spike. know E484K itself, think early evidence said E484K neutralized simply enough vacuum. [Understanding COVID-19 Vaccines Work | It’s money now. Could technically go next state get vaccinated seen big no. I'm asking considered high risk health wise, state's plan seems far off."
