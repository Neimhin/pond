California ranks 36th among 50 states, District Columbia Puerto Rico highest number coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents. absurd comment. “spoiled” (??) “selfish” demand state federal governments *everything* power — using every conceivable mechanism — get vaccine entire population quickly possible.

This worst pandemic century kills 9/11s worth Americans every single day, tens thousands around globe. 
The entire country, fact entire developed world — mobilized like war effort. Yes, logistics scaling difficult. Yes, precursors needed supplies infinite. Yes, need lot qualified scientists engineers. unexpected.

There dozens factories online producing millions doses promising vaccines since early summer. Anything else unacceptable.

Why entire western world waiting factories Belgium? Appreciate advice. Still feeling pretty good might ibuprofen bed get ahead anything. reaction second dose? I've heard worse. ....oh fuck guys....now care.

As said: messaging biggest challenge far. Every state getting requested allotment every week. ignore awesomeness going right means, vaccines require 2 shots, they're truly vaccinated yet, right? want make sure informed correctly. Wow, worse Hooverville called suspected nearly impossible confirm due lack stored first samples. Confirmation academic adventure. clinical. two positive tests 90 days apart, intents purposes, reinfection treated such. Viral titers highest beginning infection taper infection progresses. 45 days around limit RT-qPCR detection first infection. think thought already? Come now. literally job right now.

No idea lol, know thousand times do.  Oh I'm sorry prestigious science journal world good enough you.

Hope helps. According SCB (source : ) currently +500 total deaths year compared 2015-2019 average considering half december reported properly happened yet. Even take average 2015-2019 leftover days, put total excess 5000 baseline. currently, 2020 reported deaths higher 2015-2019 baseline November December might even more.  sure vaccines didn’t cause mutations? probably US UK Hi OP, allow case vaccine trackers! better daily discussion, check subreddit FAQ!

During time relaxation Orange county, population normalized mortality rate higher rest it’s well established credible science proving current individual lockdown measures real impact infections mortality.

More like there's science want believe. numerous studies show lockdowns effect infections mortality. New York Cuomo said back April 600 cases Manhattan patients 100% home isolation 4 weeks still became infected. 

They 100% home isolation stayed home entire time. venture somebody family ventured brought virus back home. seems logical assume ventilation apartments style dwellings. even staying home sure path safety.

Oh heck yea, can't wait season 3! like 70% us get shot decent chunk remainder virus fine problem micro economics.

Pfizer Moderna limited production capacity. Now, could invest build more, take long time do. moment passed. could jack price supply low. I'm sure build capacity house.

But, societal standpoint, could made relinquish patents extent - actually done Write brothers anything Germans building warplanes. 

They could licensed patents pharmaceuticals makers fair profitable license fee - Sanofi, J&amp;J, Novartis, AstraZeneca, manufacturers asia, etc. Let produce approved vaccines well.

They that, companies know never let potential competition get foot door. undoubtly learn new methods gain expertise, licensing could ultinately backfire competitor beats next vaccine. 

What best Pfizer necessarily best world. 

But humanity, moral economic optimal decision would allow everybody manufacture vaccine strict quality standards sell, regardless patent specific approved version. Or, allow pay reasonable license fee. counter argument would many companies competing buy materials supply chain, could really make entire supply chain less efficient. Thats assuming capacity contraint process raw materials distribution, case Pfizer Moderna producing would better. 

I assume, maybe wrongly, critical constraint manufacturing vaccine itself. 

Side note, major vaccine makers essentially colluded formed pact overcharge first market. want competitor gain huge profits selling extreme prices got approval first want negative PR industry. bc false. fauci expects herd immunity end spring/beginning summer Thanks giving entire document look find one issue brought up.

I find interesting quote:
""In primary efficacy analysis, additional 19 cases severe COVID-19 (one resulted death COVID-19), total 30 severe COVID-19 cases starting 14days dose 2, per adjudication committee assessment. 30 cases placebo group.""

Now talking adverse reactions, common one pain, afflicted 87-90% people vaccine 2-3 days. yeah, sounds like pleasant experience. 

But see stat document claims 20% severe side effect anywhere. see 1.4% &amp; 1.5% severe adverse events listed page 40. also says 21.9% first shot, 23.9% second shot - also reported 19.4% first placebo, 21.6% second placebo.

""In FDA’s opinion following review narratives, 3 SAEs considered likely related, including one report intractable nausea/vomiting 2 reports facial swelling"" (pg. 44)

So either misread data, got info conspiracy site know read, maybe missed something point out? Oh yeah.... “Coronavirus”...... like coronavirus back head I’ve lived lot states moving California totally want move back! laws decisions much rational xenophobic, country basically follows CA within years passing groundbreaking laws anyways. feels good trailblazers. Biden man!!! Healthcare accounts 17% US GDP. it’s surprising. That's normal injection pretty much kind due amount liquid pushed muscle. ...and rubles. ain't Japan France god sudden? tell exactly how, lol.. Covid infected Aids breed HIV mutated something else.   dangerous 102deg fever? Obviously getting covid potential dangerous, know fever compares. vaccines side effects, common probably pain soreness injection site, course we're generally fine with, obviously threshold side effects could worth it? Really reasonable evidence based claims here. Thank sharing another rational angle. Cool, 1 million 10 days. rate, it'll take 8+ years vaccinate entire US population. virus literally genetic material protein. Mutating Yes, first symptom. put pain killer point dealing severe pneumonia covid. 70% lung space compromised pneumonia even small breathes causing extreme pain back/shoulder. think doctor, monitoring heavily afar, thought possible going die. kept saying next three days id either get better take turn serious worse, put pain meds could sleep. slept day everyday next two days thankfully began able breathe again. Don’t bother, President isn’t going anymore giving time day. go back mocked. 1 million people vaccinated 10 days comes 100,000 day. 

100,000 x 365, assuming vaccinate people 365 days year probably overly optimistic, makes total 36.5 million one year.

So rate, without even considering need administer second doses, would take 9 years vaccinate roughly entire US population (36.5 million x 9 = 328.5 million).

But current thinking vaccine probably grants immunity year less, everyone need refresher shot every months year... 

Am crazy, things looking good? Please someone tell math wrong. Great worries! r/iamatotalpieceofshit think ban citizens returning home?

Wow Health insurance premiums employers whose members low covid vaccination rates increase. Honestly, think drives employers mandate vaccinations. 2021 year revenge ""FUCK 2020!!!!"" bashes plus mask burning.

Heh, covid hotspot whole time 3 closest coworkers get vaccine. learned life people change ready so. one family saying take vaccine, multiple medical professionals family. Seems like fear-based science-based decision. Logic pretty much dictates ""get vaccine, get covid"". Astounding people fear vaccine fear wide range medical outcomes reside ""asymptonatic"" ""death"". used deaths indication spread since reliable measurement time testing cought small fraction cases.

Death per capita kind irrelevant numbers still small evenly distributed Sweden... even 1% population. hey start. You’re charged?! this? **TL:DR** using numbers lie, Covid still number one cause death currently US.

Back taught statistics one favorite quotes Mark Twain, ""There liars, dam liars, statisticians"".

Let's take quick look see story misleading data really telling.

""a total 621 people died drug overdoses year San Francisco, compared 173 deaths **the city** COVID-19""

First thing look at, since says city. many hospitals caring Covid patients city? many Covid deaths hospitals surrounding area? many residents city died Covid (regardless location death)?

Second, IIRC 46% Covid deaths nursing home patients (this may old stat). feeling SF high cost living expensive real estate nursing homes. 

SF skews younger general population age distribution city follows: 107,524 people (13.4%) age 18, 77,664 people (9.6%) aged 18 24, 301,802 people (37.5%) aged 25 44, 208,403 people (25.9%) aged 45 64, 109,842 people (13.6%) 65 years age older. median age 38.5 years. every 100 females, 102.9 males. every 100 females age 18 over, 102.8 males. ).

Finally, virus disappear travels outside SF city limits. Infections originating SF kill people many areas.

**Conclusion**; Covid currently number one cause death US. average marriage lasts 8 years, probably right. Body bag manufacturers hear thrilled. That’s exactly facility except test patients test positive staff tested positive upper management didn’t even tell us. find staff. contact them. Every medicine market. There's army scientists every major pharmaceutical company. (I'm one them). 

Academic insights basic biology/biochemistry may identify targets pursue, drug discovery, preclinical studies, toxicology studies, clinical trials, pharmacokinetics, formulation design, chemical biological process development, etc employ massive number scientists. industry spends $80 billion R&amp;D, double budget NIH.

Anyway, I'd grateful diminish efforts colleagues industry dislike capitalism. working asses bring new medicine patients. 36th now. Wouldn’t much surprise significantly higher month considering new epicenter 80+ elderly population vaccinated, US vaccination programme already saved 50k people another 10 months test, EUA apply variants? doctor?  nothing offended here. hope infection rate well 100 million everything ive read estimates 2-3x current figure. north 100 million 1 3, reported 5 1 march would 200 million 2 3 approx current 200k day. seeing reported 5x estimate? need wait least 2-3 weeks get vaccine that. needs time thing. 

And sound stupid. miss normalcy. want go get hair chopped April fixed. fish food scandal? local newspaper local officials estimated 60% care home residents willing get vaccine, based first responses. 40% oldest risk aren’t willing take it. That’s sad I’m Tampa Bay Area Florida. much liquid assets, though? Raising base IQ one patient time.

Thank you, like it, try continue using it. proven women higher pain tolerance men? get wrong. I'm particular fan sensationalism article. 

I understand comparison statement ""We can't know certain"", however different let explain why. I'm trying say can't know certain simply assume racial bias involved, (similar police might say) comparison. 


All said, also explain decent chance (although easy prove one way another) racial bias present case. 

Studies implicit bias show doctors likely hold negative racial stereotypes, implicit bias may activated stressful conditions. 

Now article describes woman told doctor pain, able receive appropriate treatment despite test results proved needed. think alone *least* conclude care standard, doctor made mistake bring race it. However think pretty damn reasonable imagine doctors implicit bias towards black people (whether that's viewing black women inherently loud obnoxious, general mistrust, difference perception pain tolerance), *could* heightened even due stressful conditions covid, thus causing make mistake. 

My point evidence racial bias medical system strong. take articles like face value. Ultimately us readers power determining whether medical facility punished corrected this. However, use opportunity direct attention systemic issues evidence existing.

I came medical school $180,000 debt months “volunteering”. actually try block overly dramatic news postings last month. best can, whatever gets upvoted break rules gets upvoted. Recently, figure millions Americans look guidance — Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, adviser Trump administration incoming Biden administration — begun incrementally raising herd-immunity estimate...
In pandemic’s early days, Dr. Fauci tended cite 60 70 percent estimate experts did. month ago, began saying “70, 75 percent” television interviews. last week, interview CNBC News, said “75, 80, 85 percent” “75 80-plus percent.”
In telephone interview next day, Dr. Fauci acknowledged slowly deliberately moving goal posts. so, said, partly based new science, partly gut feeling country finally ready hear really thinks.
Hard may hear, said, believes may take close 90 percent immunity bring virus halt — almost much needed stop measles outbreak.
Asked Dr. Fauci’s conclusions, prominent epidemiologists said may proven right. early range 60 70 percent almost undoubtedly low, said, virus becoming transmissible, take greater herd immunity stop it.
Dr. Fauci said weeks ago, hesitated publicly raise estimate many Americans seemed unsure vaccines, would need accept almost universally country achieve herd immunity.
Now polls showing many Americans ready, even eager, vaccines, said felt could deliver tough message return normal might take longer anticipated.
“When polls said half Americans would take vaccine, saying herd immunity would take 70 75 percent,” Dr. Fauci said. “Then, newer surveys said 60 percent would take it, thought, ‘I nudge bit,’ went 80, 85.” Never point said food within country bad insignificant. said america known food. said.

There'd 75b gain all, loss. remember, 75b essentially represents assumed profit life time company, like actual cash bank company spend. misleading metric. thought gave hazard pay Seaweed one potassium-rich foods there! delicious salad.

It’s easy absolutists virtue-signalers social media sit basements try heap shame visiting family holidays year, it’s simple. 2.8 million people - average per year USA, even Covid - isn’t going next Christmas.

Santa Claus bringing CoViD town Well 100 mill travel normal year... 15% terrible. attitude ""oh odds .."" combined ""give elderly people break distraction""

I'm teacher, tons colleagues went go partying without masks, cramped together.
Same attitude ""oh what's chance someone it. Look! Nobody sick""

People plain stupid really selfish. Ah yes, close 657,000 thousand doses day. Thats 600% increase week before, keep up! See also: masks 

Rule number one public health honest public. It’s joke fauci allowed lead pulled misinformation stunts HIV crisis. true? Must lot empty nearly metal tubes going back forth then. Cargo bays probably full though. Casinos traditionally utilized one specific age demographic times I’ve one city, yet evil scapegoat pandemic damn millennials going bars headlines like don’t get lot traction. It’s almost like news knows profit blaming young people, considering target audience. I'm thinking kill nun, mention pie young Chan? Tell I’m wrong. I’ve corrected lie, source, ordered 20 million vaccinations, reality ordered one billion manufacturers. 

I corrected source incorrectly stated could Pfizer doses right now, reality orders would come second quarter 2021.

And country I’m aware vaccinated people US one week. 

So, urge tell I’m wrong. Basically they're screwed answered question post... ""I realize everyone knows comorbidities""... people comorbidities so... old people people working medical vaccinated right they'll vaccinating people working grocery stores... vaccinating obese, asthmatic, dark skinned people cause... Idk that's groups people find I'm guessing be. Telling people ""we going vaccinate dark people first"" get lot hatred white people... Dark people higher chance dying virus cause skin tone cause get less vitamin cause outside longer get vitamin would. Also obese people... legally say people. What's weight limit? even calculate out? Agreed California knocking park! 

Way go leaders state, MPV. Casinos depressing enough; go one deadly pandemic? Hi, developed COVID symptoms 8 days ago, starting feel better. Low fever, aches, sore throat, Lost smell day 5. Never shortness breath anything concerning. Tracked o2, temp, HR entire time. 

I got PCR test + flu test today, negative. odds COVID already cleared testable viral load 8 days symptom onset?

I saw CDC say end quarantine negative test day 7, I’m assuming possible? I’m going get antibody tested 3 weeks regardless. it’s pretty lame got pretty sick wasn’t even COVID. people high risk severe allergic reaction...? Santa Reeper. Int' WAYYY down. Less 5% normal. usual, logic sub downvoted. think scapegoating, sensationalism. Back January-March sub used bring insightful information. Nowadays primarily collection 'who come sensational title'. 

Sad. Registered nurse here. Seen pandemic fatigue PTSD front line nursing. Fauci. guy. love you. NEED stop answering hypotheticals don’t know answer, especially you’re going change every time. looked videos yet, can't say covid-related are, presumably Prof. Racaniello touches covid lecture relevant. event, think would useful people trying understand mechanism various treatments covid, probably vaccines. 

There 28 lectures average length hour 10 minutes so.

If there's enough interest, perhaps could create sub discussing lecture, /r/virologyCourse something. Perhaps. kind of, yes. mostly comparing LA area areas California. admit data anecdotal researched. said immune covid-19 Thinking exact thing. Ever since UK varient surges SoCal made think wouldn’t surprised variant new one. know far many people coworkers come last week never feel guilty. blame falls anti-maskers. blame falls Trump every single person voted him. Still safer getting COVID. first smallpox vaccines extremely dangerous today's standards, yet people got anyway safer catching smallpox. telling people travel travel thanksgiving make qualified job. That’s public trust health professionals declined significantly. can’t tell people something name public health break rules. point goalposts became “we stay home one dies anymore” Anti-vaxxers also get priority care. doctors echoed sentiment. obviously can't that, mean like to. Went drop meds nursing home Central Indiana last night around 3 stupid cunt sitting dining area without mask, breathing everything 

It made angry 

If wearing mask now, wearing mask times, means likely means odds better probably breathing god damn virus everything 

Unbelievable 

I'm one ""bye bye job"" shitlibs, *is* one things can't follow basic safety guidelines (gonna go limb guess 250-pound elephant horfer ass ""has trouble breathing"" one on) keep *other people safe,* working nursing home. Thankfully, we're talking nurse, think CNA something, still. 

Unbelievable can’t see Joe Biden Justin Trudeau stepping saying, “Ok businesses, ok restaurants, open sorry small percentage die”

Yeah mainly cause Biden say that. Or: “We’ve sacrificed nine months lives. Fauci’s news floating another 12 months. That’s trade we’re willing make. We’ll take chances.” history allergies, allowed trial. Im RN works Orange County Los Angeles. It’s bad. hardest year life. switched hospitals due facility able handle first surge safer without compromising patients staff. I’ve never worked harder life. y’all people cushy ass jobs sitting home working remotely won’t understand struggle us healthcare staff go hospitals become run understaffed. least there’s job security 🤷🏻‍♂️ matter time mutates point new vaccines worthless.

We deserve everything that's coming us selfish, myopic actions many. Fuck assholes.  Bay Area already trouble need shit. rip Aye Biden told 30-something governors last week need plan schools opened within 100 days. understands political cost dragging on. I’ve seeing lot videos near empty hospitals USA Britain. got thinking packed hospitals would feature news surely. haven’t seen news yet. conspiracy theorist genuinely curious. “We don’t need mass vaccination tents right now.”

*Also person*

“Why fuck shit still shut July!” Nursing homes gonna pretty rad 50 years residents actually know use Netflix, computers game consoles. Hell, they'll arcade machines ""living room"" homes continue focus importance activity. remember thinking people seeing healthy 60-something guy brush super mild symptoms would stem panic hysteria. wrong was. Sorry break you, sub full people like get turned fearmongering emotionally based articles. sure why, maybe it’s makes feel self righteous something. Judging comment history, head far ass, you’re one who’s touch.

No one would complain content posted informational, that’s far case you’re delusional see it. don’t test much either positivity rate tends skewed amount preventative testing done film industry gets rolled overall testing numbers (healthcanada separates numbers available, bc isn’t transparent numbers).

The good news hospitalization numbers don’t reflect higher spread accounted for, testing numbers - overall lack transparency province - well backing many people think outdated ideas behind transmissions among children within schools - definitely caused lot people lose faith response here.

But numbers going down, feel lot hopeful things November time high even numbers sometimes asteroid next it...  Tbh, I'd take mRNA vaccine, like something artificially manipulated mRNA level get cells directly without going natural checkpoints like antigen presenting cells, need long term safety data accept that.  missing result study could ""no indication"" ""study shows survive Covid-19 innate immune responses, antibody production, means protection reinfection"", antibodies way people clear infection. immune system complex, far answers ""survivors Covid-19 antibodies antibodies definitely confer protection reinfection"" thinking always going less million day forever things ramp time healthcare worker, first responder, high risk death infected, likely vaccine least 6 months. lol level 1 trauma center none patients vaccinating Palestinians tho live Ontario, lockdown here, weird driving mall parking lot empty except drugstore liquor store still stay open. medicinal. mean dude one get sick get someone else sick like kids can't get vaccine... still go parties people mask on... one stopping going parties mask especially outside... I've gone one two hang outs year outside people masks food people sat away people. Like hard that. hug people mask also. careful. start kissing random strangers giving virus... Time Ontario follow provinces hold second dose. vaccines reliably coming use up. Consent governed. everyone starts ignoring statements like people like Fauci become old man angry neighbors party. equivalent goku literally never ever trying fight new opponent, let’s enemy gets stronger reason eliminate threat right now.(IE CELL SAGA) statistic like viewed skepticism. Survey taken month ago based relatively small sample size.

“Nearly 4 10 Americans say would “definitely” “probably” get vaccine, according Pew Research Center survey 12,648 U.S. adults Nov. 18 29” Tablet multivitamins tend complete I've seen. Since new strain came UK, start calling British virus English virus? USA goes hungry bunch selfish fucks wearing masks. Deserved! wrong. Australia 8 new cases day, losing minds, lucky Vorgy's peak 2021. openly admits article pushing goalposts. point it’s right wing conspiracy they’re moved people setting openly saying they’re it. China tried cover fact highly contagious disease spreading. UK straight told world expense... There's massive difference. division naive estimate numbers presented, Youyang Gu guy. 

He literally guy. I've got 6 Youyang's working now. estimates much line actual predictions seen methodology paper November:

""As rough estimate, believe COVID-19 deaths US undercounted roughly 30-40%. IIFR 0.5% would imply true, age-adjusted IFR around 0.6-0.8%. consistent published reports CDC estimates.""

We less actual infections predicted third wave based actual serology studies rather machine learning. Additionally, projection global projection, define wave?

A wave period increased cases disease peak eventually subsides. show wave we’re deadly shorter time? US went ~5 deaths March 100k May. We’ve gone 230k deaths October 330k December.

More people dying per day March-May. trough trough, periodicity waves around ~4.5 months. March-July wave 1. July Mid October wave 2. Mid-October current wave. done wave yet people dying per day right testing completely nonexistent high income countries months in.

IFR based serology testing...not PCR testing. CFR based PCR testing. Serology testing measures many people ""were"" infected, currently ""are"" infected. Less serological testing performed poorer countries making harder get accurate get lack deaths means widen confidence interval, look staggering lack death sub Saharan Africa (and rest 3rd world) due virus.

As I've said repeated, countries universally younger. median age sub-Saharan Africa less 20 years old. number low estimate IFR Imperial College provided actually within narrower window high income countries. Despite lack testing. Despite lack reporting. Despite mitigation.

Confidence intervals smaller numbers closely agree largely due age effect. Smaller sample sizes smaller numbers serological tests also closely agree other. Smaller sample sizes larger numbers serological tests increase confidence intervals. That's basic statistics data analysis. yeah, IFR noisy cases, it’s noisy 0.3 3rd world countries like 1.3 1st world countries.

The reason larger confidence intervals high income countries, I've stated, there's variation brought varying degrees mitigation. numbers less likely agree other. thinking intra results rather inter results. mean results invalid. sounds pleasant! get record? Donald Trump? Yes yes, Coachella, even Beyond that, underground raves I'm sure everyone one fine seeing gram-gram christmas true. front line situation supposed CDC, never deployed front. we’re left medical workers holding line Ditto. Shut god shops. strange, wore masks, ** happened there? revenge smallpox blankets? “Going doctor” different admitted hospital. Going doctor implies doctor see willingly office go home. admitted hospital happens avenues: referral urgent care, nursing home/rehab center ER, walking ER providing transportation ER Yeah, back September first saw it. everywhere already. Wow thought respect human life 🥺 “lockdown” joke, pretty whatever want, people are. Also exception office workers, everyone going work like normal. Thank you. finally got work home I'm relieved. I'm front line worker. I'm claims adjuster medical bills among things I'm exhausted mandatory overtime. retired someone pay mortgage worst part 80 year old grandma recovered treatment well, nobody wants hear stories. want negative stories. fairness, virus *is* political America. way remove silence people expressing feeling fact. understand mods position remove them, can't good conscience agree it. still screening bombs terrorists priority anymore?

I mean, comparing numbers, terrorist kill maximum 200-300 people plane, covid 300 000. Sounds like need stop trying kill people... agree pandemic. state actions. seems like good indicator me. started taking seriously weeks personally. took lot U.S. countries even longer.

I completely disagree. also compare previous year, hitting peak 2020 still incredibly dangerous valid topic comparison.  Dude, I'm one talking to. went war shot people, like normal person. 

So student debt. shrapnel lower back. 

Still go school paid though. everything thread downvoted today? many people outright dismissing China Russia. That’s right. Thanks usual, part found important;

*"" ""I can't predict mutations appear order time, make pretty sure prediction going evolve escape immunity like everything always does,"" said Holmes, evolutionary virologist University Sydney, Sydney, Australia, involved mapping SARS-CoV-2 genome. ""That's inevitable consequence natural selection. played millennia happen again."" ""*

I'm reminded ""evolutionary arms race"" Richard Dawkins talked about. BTW, know; Dawkins ""creator"" ""Memes"" 1 million already??! That’s super awesome! Feels like vaccine came love already got million people done Wait.

If stayed 1mm doses per week, would 52 million per year.

There ~330 million people US. take Pfizer Moderna vaccine, that's 660 million doses needed vaccinate everyone.

Tm current rate, fastest could occur would 12.69 years. believe assumes get another vaccine, two. J&amp;J probably AZ coming shortly, too. recently campaigning office many LA constituents didn’t wear masks generally did. It’s probably already overseas given number flights rush ppl trying get London hard lockdowns.... vaccinated yesterday. throbbing sinus headache, improving Tylenol. side effects list ""headache"", course -- anyone know manner headache typical post-vaccine? tremendous fear went long acquire disease \~12-day period immune response mounted. portion unfortunate people will. :( state governor announced plebs lock deprived two biggest holidays year, packed bags went Miami.

It possibly biggest case hypocrisy crisis, competition fierce. [This says first dose, efficacy 52.4% Pfizer 80.2% Moderna. means vaccines likely need modified deployed new variant right? I’m expanding pod either way super soon. It’s beyond ridiculous point. going attempt it, it. quarantining working home, I. okay it. 


But reason suddenly saying ""fuck it"" large get together family. Cognitive dissonance. way going see party least 2 3 weeks, assuming go back quarantine. Could share models? 1 million down, 249 million go!

Quick read makes seem used cutpoints interaction term, think non-linear transformation probably appropriate. said, may possible limited spread community transmission rates sample data. elected government official? so, year’s end. not, eat cake wait. Got call mom today. father came home early work dizziness. 

He's going take test tomorrow, im concerned. dizziness common early symptom? That’s curious. didn’t realize sign process, thought “here’s spot schedule week” opt option. less hoops jump through, better, kind thing. Interesting! work government. Mutation slides chat... got vac today. 

Was dizzy prollie due hunger, arm feel like bruised. sweet.

They stated 14 days fully effective second shot long term. pfizer shot.

I keep journal 7 days anything wonky symptoms. misread Fomite Fortnite fuckin' baffled second Fortnite anything Covid. Oh mean pandemic itself. mean lockdowns killing economy theory weather. Coronavirus thrives cold. Things safe previously longer safe. used 0.0001% chance catching COVID grocery store, example, 0.0005% chance. cumulative risk adds across population.

But, would nice see real data, ideally contact tracing. didn’t hard lockdowns earlier.... pointless everything goes really well. Pfizer vaccine success, lot Europe US would waiting 2022 dose. stands, extra capacity could still helping parts world. virus mutates whole world needs new shot 2022. doomsday anti-vaxxer cult decides take one production plants. That's kind irrelevant though, we're talking severity disease young individuals anything else. Lol yea people(who adults subscribing r/Harry Potter) downvoted said chance existing vaccines might work it’s directed someone otherwise used uncivil reasons, typically! That’s good! bottle neck dispensing them. ask doctor? get notified turn? hell even work?! agree alot feel-good narcotics medical uses good luck telling cops feel like assistance funding ‘loose-seal’ People labeled crazy trust quickest vaccine history, combined entirely new RNA vaccine protocol prevent disease nearly everyone 60 survives little impact them. 

The government big pharma would NEVER fuck things cause problems. yes people questioning crazy ones... ones rushing get poked. became one 1 million today! though? Stop feeling sorry man. know exactly doing. grown ass people, children. Don’t matter healthcare providers cannot dispense quickly enough. I've needed something live entire life. I'm glad Covid going get control I'm sad shut-in piece shit going go back seen outcast. year, instead looking like weirdo, seemed sensible. back weirdo. :( Late summer code 2022

This scares :( I'm young prime, want actually LIVE survive sitting house day long. sucks. Anti-worker propaganda Countries surging anyway. Stop spreading crap. fair, first time drive car, get fastest speed ever, fastest.
Until then, car goes 2 mph. rapid test “strong showing” Covid still possible PCR test comes back negative? mild symptoms I’m quarantining regardless I’m curious. hope wearing mask coughing! 😅 It’s shitshow. Every leader stinks. least every day tv telling knew Good. government right demand leave house. Fuck them. long bosses require mandatory mask usage refuse get vaccinated, shouldn’t problem. also people country world done far. could more, pretty good context.

If want make sort comparison, sensible think terms per capita rates raw total. UK past 500 k doses 1/5^th population USA. 

It's also important consider GDP per capita thinking performance national efforts sort; interesting see places like Cuba do. both, 6 million doses 3 million people.. he's 41 sisters hospital extra doses first round vaccinations! use within certain time thawed out.

They took walk ins employees used vaccine. Although wish people signed first group, might mean line go faster think. variant strain. closely related group genetic lineages clearly stand apart rest lineages graph. semi-unemployed extra assistance CA much appreciated. quit long ago qualified. Fingers-crossed something happens. comes free Frogurt! Why? 

His state worst outcomes. Everyone made excuses first round hit first states time prepare, time fall/winter strain came around, comparatively bad outcome. Limited antibody tests show lasts 5 7 months.

I covid November still plan getting vaccine. I'm hurry obvious reasons. However, I'm hoping get vaccine around time antibodies wear off. think labor actually performing injections close primary bottleneck here. would take shot heartbeat. Yes, takes years train nurses, increasing number nursing schools pumping nurses alleviate nursing shortage. Paying nurses extra money go far. problem twofold. Hospitals create hostile working environment ignoring workplace violence, inadequately staffing units order funnel money top, cutting costs equipment leaves nurses without adequate PPE supplies. also problem nursing burnout inevitably occurs working condition. conditions effectively renders hospitals unable retain nurses. problem burnout severe according NSI annual RN staffing report 25% newly hired nurses leave position within year, 50% employees quit nursing position less two years service. Hospitals can't retain staff normal conditions. quick solutions hospitals greedy enact proper solutions. all. 
The Swedish approach muted foothold also Estonian Health Agency. Sweden hosts one international centers disease control thus actively tried influence others follow Sweden's lead death.

Either way, 9.5 million vaccines available, inside someone's arm, someone fucking up.

True that's another con besides loss taste pleasure intention vaccinating kids 12 June. Adults teens ones getting vaccinated. age 12-15 Pfizer testing finished early Spring determine group vaccinated. Lol what? We’re exponentially vaccinated people every day Here’s don’t understand. Would love input..

If contracted it, shouldn’t still antibodies?? need vaccine, wouldn’t give overdose (if that’s even possible) antibodies?

Or show use publicity promote taking vaccine? felt sick self quarantined early December, got tested, came back negative, went back work.

""I aunt working rest nurses works 15 patients per nurse. breaks tears stress what's going on. awful""

""Here NYC tell 1:12 every day ER""

""I used staff float staff Midwest hospital, [12:1] happened time. supposed 7:1, never staff that."" never said solely due Thanksgiving, certainly impact kinds social gatherings one primary vectors transmission. think cases going keep going Christmas New Year's kidding yourself. need source I’m going assume you’re misremembering straight lying. *are* ramping shipments ramping storage time. literally both.  7% similar vaccines seems  science's version mic drop Theyre free, cost? curious, going take spring vaccinate average person ??
Seems like extremely long wait probably quite bit moer that, hard tell Different countries use Sinovac Moderna/Pfizer, really choice.

Mostly developing countries use Chinese vaccines (and also Russian vaccine, Oxford Novavax). I’ll happily take trash vaccine dose please. deserve doubt guilt grandma wanting see you, refuse visit keep safe dies anyways loneliest time life. many Microsoft products purchased Times like people need proper guidance, get it.
I'm Canadian things quite different here.The place worked recently small outbreak.500 employees follow strict guidelines,there protesting everybody complied.The outbreak contained.
I think I'm trying say breakdown proper guidance caused lot issues masks vaccines understand huge 
Division US right now. Lol 7 day averages showed you, daily numbers. takes account variability reporting. know bothered post. mean reality is, shouldn’t politicians getting vaccinated TV. celebrities. (And maybe are, reddit main source news local it’s popular post, don’t know it.)

To go along you’re saying, people like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Chuck Norris action heroes tough guys televise getting vaccinated.

It’s probably sad people follow celebrities like cult, works...... speak russian /s Same. arm never sore life. worth it!! 343 go! mean people psychologically designed live entire year cooped significant other?

So either knew able keep delivery schedule, article true.

Can't both. Either way, they're lying. ass understand. nice move macron. said that, appears negotiation move anything structural. EU didn’t impose this, France specifically No, never met small groups since virus started working home like everyone else. planning meet quarantining month holidays.

Thankfully school district follows science. can't imagine depriving kids education cases transmission school. ten times zero still zero don’t think data yet. know hospitalizations higher among young people new one. complain president managed fuck even simple tasks. entire resources US, can't manage distribution logistics single product. Trump failed every regard coronavirus, win handed silver platter, ducks too. So, complaining vaccine, complain handling it. speak worldwide perspective anyone pushes panic button. 60% tough sell skeptical public. take 60% effective vaccine first one available me, safe get 95% effective one later available? control age... median age almost sub-Saharan Africa 20.

Throw holidays don’t think it’s possible. want create panic?... Great news US trial still underway. That's approved US now. 

Not standards, finished. Right?! 90%+ fatalities come specific groups at-risk. Vaccinate COVID deaths less flu. end there. live California though question rationale unless money runs out... agree everything said. 

Have nice day! We're scheduled first injections 27th, Germany. now, local distribution field vacc centers built. Berlin looking reasonable rest country behind.

We're mostly going using Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine needs kept dead cold delivered injected pretty much Peanuts specific Indiana, specifically area. frustrated Congress too, change fact vaccinating Members Congress helps government function.  That's ""we thankful anyway remarkable crowd"" understand. think vaccination effort became 90%+ logistics first vaccine actually formulated in, what, February March?

The logistical effort monumental. people rightly criticize current round screw-ups federal government, including basic things like ""we forgot vaccines QA tested yet actually lot less thought"". New grads replace burned nurses, dont really add supply 15+ years nursing shortage. would panic? 

Most people assume virus won’t go away everyone infected. 

This virus would good news people would achieve goal faster. we're 1,009 deaths per million. took 6 days. crystal ball, think (mostly) 2022. fact, might long then. stay hopeful keep distance then.  reported totals way behind number doses already administered. like someone presses button makes tally go every time give shot.

Definition logistics

1 : aspect military science dealing procurement, maintenance, transportation military matériel, facilities, personnel

2 : handling details operation

The second definition? **THE HANDLING DETAILS OPERATION.**

Appropriate staffing vaccination infrastructure (like office/clinic space) details vaccine distribution operation.  know stay home. I'd know ya gotta spread 🤷 us deal things different ways.

I drove hospital house last night seeing 3 ambulances 15 minutes pass sure enough 4 fire trucks lined 3 tents normally parking lot.

I literally never thought would see situation hospital child born last year would treating people tents set parking lot.

Did make pun little stupid joke? Yeah... us need little levity keep going crazy situations. I’m glad aren’t one them. shift, accept shift. us: 6-7 days 1 mio

germany: 10-11 months 1,1 mio LUL article focuses actions hospitals taken, part due state staffing Sweden similar Nordic Baltic countries, Belgium. Belgium much higher population density much higher air pollution levels possibly less frequent vitamin consumption. mean chances slim covid. even doctors call “happy hypoxia.” Pulse ox extremely low talking seemed breathing ok. 

Wasn’t flu strep. negative those. could probably skip middle man pay people $150 take vaccine. would totally fine invite covid positive friend play kids infect don’t get older?

Is you’re saying? Yeah could lots issues double positives. far many variables. think agree happens. hopefully common (at least point). Nobody want's that. science looking decent. hope immunity least decent serious covid give reprieve, get vaccine. Nobody wants dealing shit twice. Thanks reply. “Give us bit time compare trials make sure line say anything” got mine yesterday, guess one first million :) astrazenca produced MUCH faster (a bit double amount others). whole storage issue Pfizer (and certain extent Moderna) non-existent. cringe every time hear word thrown around first thought ""damn amazing people"" ""Oh boy, wonder people exploited"". I'm sorry mean go tangent, want people understand anyone charge (or media) uses word usually expense someone else.

Also thank working VA! I've used local VA working somethings years ago people amazing, extremely helpful. hope know I'd I'm without help. antivaxxers legit reason, thats sad reality is

But people who, now, first, right still new, simply delaying. want see plays out. Things happen. First release vaccine ever coronavirus, mention time turn even comes up, may strains dont even respond vaccine. others list want it, perhaps best next person gets it

Just another POV Care must rationed.

People warned, didn’t listen.

No doctor nurse work without proper PPE third wave.

They took nose first two waves, millions upon millions Americans traveling week, putting huge F-you healthcare workers nation wide.

The way get change apparently bodies streets.

Deniers continue claim hospitals aren’t overwhelmed, absolutely healthcare workers strike second there’s adequate PPE, patient ratios off.

Make public see reality going on. Hey asked info come out. nervous British South African mutations? Ngl kinda panicking People put restrictions another months led alone another year. US pretty much given already eggs vaccine basket. lmao, fuck aren't, regardless might think

the majority reddit users american love try downplay canada even deserved Well hopefully vaccine .  See you’re saying makes sense. You’re actually telling it’s “fine” deliberately infect child coronavirus, right?

That gloatingly trying say, right? got mine yesterday!  know spend money ahead time right?

If buy pie 20 costs 5 make spend 15 improving recipes buying equipment ahead time make with.

They also part operation warp speed... Try reading something besides /r/politics  atleast 1 million people infected 6 days coz braindead deniers,right? SÃO PAULO—Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech Ltd. delayed announcement results late-stage trials Covid-19 vaccine January consolidates data Brazil test results Indonesia Turkey.

Brazil, first country complete Phase 3 trials CoronaVac, expected announce vaccine’s efficacy rate Wednesday. However, Brazil’s Butantan Institute, research center backed São Paulo’s state government testing CoronaVac, said Sinovac asked 15 days analyze data together results trials vaccine, also tested Indonesia Turkey.

“There can’t three efficacy results vaccine,” said Butantan’s director, Dimas Covas. said delay nothing efficacy vaccine, expected one first approved use Brazil.

Scientists tracking vaccine hoped CoronaVac would comparable Covid-19 vaccines shown much 95% effective.

“It frustrating…this vaccine moment Brazilian soil,” said Luiz Carlos Dias, part Covid-19 task force researchers University Campinas São Paulo state. “I’m worried perhaps efficacy rate high all.”

Other researchers said weren’t concerned, dismissing delay mere contractual issue. “It’s anticlimax, must happened Sinovac banned announcing result, likely it’s result one country,” said Carlos Fortaleza, epidemiologist São Paulo State University. 

While Mr. Covas said couldn’t announce trial’s results, said CoronaVac passed 50% threshold efficacy, meaning regulators could give green light use.

The Wall Street Journal first reported Monday Phase 3 results showed [CoronaVac passed 50% set international scientists vaccine considered viable.

Sinovac, Beijing-based private firm also developed vaccines hepatitis B, H5N1 avian flu virus, H1N1 swine flu virus, didn’t immediately respond requests comment. 

With disease largely control home, China’s vaccine makers turned countries carry clinical trials. 

Brazil proved ideal testing ground. Covid-19 ravaged Latin American country, killing almost 190,000 people, second U.S. upside grim statistics country able test vaccines much faster countries Covid-19 control. 

Mr. Covas said 200 Phase 3 trial’s volunteers contracted Covid-19, allowing scientists calculate CoronaVac’s efficacy rates seeing many people took vaccine placebo. definitive results, researchers waiting minimum 154 volunteers contract Covid-19 figure quickly surpassed disease came roaring back Brazil recent weeks following earlier declines.

Trials CoronaVac Turkey Indonesia still ongoing. 

Brazilian infectious disease specialists tracking CoronaVac’s development hoping results similar vaccines developed Inc. jointly Inc. [BioNTech shown efficacy rates 94.5% 95% final stages testing, respectively. Unlike two vaccines, new types genetic-code vaccines, CoronaVac one many traditional virus-based vaccines use killed weakened form targeted virus induce immune response. 

While traditional vaccines tend lower efficacy rates, CoronaVac kept standard refrigerator 36 46 Fahrenheit, making easier transport store poorer less developed countries, infectious disease specialists said. 

São Paulo’s government plans use vaccine immunize state, home fifth Brazil’s population, end July. Butantan also plans start shipping CoronaVac May Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Honduras, Peru Uruguay. 

“It’s lot easier logistically bring vaccines Brazil China,” Colombian Health Minister Fernando Ruiz said interview. Colombia, like countries region, lacks capacity produce vaccines. Philippines also negotiations Sinovac. one seem understand reported vaccination totals way behind number doses already administered? congress decided getting vaccinated important *their* safety, *they* function, yet national mask mandate, semblance national strategy Covid important *my* safety (or 323,000 people taking COVID dirt-nap). urgent emphasis human safety six eight months ago? Thanks looking me! searching task team didn’t find anyone logistics/ops background Germany, vaccine invented, number zero. disgrace. assault,I'd walk people fix masks Pfizer uses contract manufacturers. Like drug manufacturers. Confirmed cases way true number cases March April probably hard draw conclusions those. 
 
Or, words - Sweden counts differently. 
 look like Estonia greater problems back March? 
 
Those absolute numbers, per capita. 
 3rd world countries manage epidemics Sweden can't design? 
 modern democracy complicates lot. democratic safeguards Sweden prevented government taking control country. laws place makes possible government gain power case war, laws applied pandemic. 
 
And yet Tegnell well aware country rapid reaction capabilities. job demand capabilities. Instead waxed lyrical... 25 mile stretch sea exactly tranquil.

compared 330.000 deaths since beginning/germany 28.000 ok  likely caught previous flight US. returned, met local woman, went several crowded places (department stores Costco), went fly next flight symptomatic maskless infected copilots. failed report symptoms flew maskless would EVA house rules. Cloth masks seen PPE equivalent putting wet rag mouth escape burning building. They'll emergency, something use carry usual. Natural selection. They’ll keep infecting killing other. Oh well.  lost sense taste I'd probably end eating healthy live longer ironically. Although think worth trade off. 

Assuming die covid itself. Oh must gotten around then. /s 

Plans paper fall apart time put action. They're going miss target days rate, considering scope scale pretty well executed far. “Thank Sinovac 50%, know y’all barely lmao” - Pfizer &amp; Moderna joint press release need slightly different version booster every year so. it... literally does, though?

a match tiny amount fuel, happens fire starts light exactly sweden looks like right  deserves 95% effective ones deserves 50%? reading day UK 500,000 done Dec 21st, put place structures ramp 200,000 day going foward huge, wont take long really start taking effect, 

Hopefully US get together fast, gets locations running start pushing 3-500,000 day, would better. Well REALLY insane pro-lifers homeschooling 25 children off-the-grid compound since pandemic thing usually see hear *those* ones much, thankfully. clear, position figures shot quickly lockdown position true lockdowns coincidentally happen time natural drop new cases? updates affects babies ? father 14 month old concerns obviously. Particularly new strain affects younger people more. ...and there's nothing say individuals involved places republicans either. insert political assumptions? Making puns video people dying, le epic reddit moment. Germany *is* great. 944 deaths yesterday! Nobody said going jump ahead everyone celebrity.

He simply stated get vaccine long need get one. They're intramuscular shots right? Get bunch junkies it, know difference hitting vein muscling pretty well. I've seen friend stick sweater. work choirs certainly hope know avoid half getting sick future. sickly singers spending 45 minutes practice room they're coughing. Heck no. Yeah see vaccine arrivals? ship fridges. u gotta ship thousandss fridges filled millions vaccines clinics hospitals country, time shipping production already stretched limits. Id hate person organizing that. According probability false negative day 1 exposure nearly 100%. However research little dated.

Tom Rita already virus. would get vaccine antibodies already blood? Totally agree. speed new year, believe locations US start offering too, places like CVS/Walgreens etc, offer jabs already, happen, push numbers way fast. Yup. that’s happen. Debbie downer coukd irrelevant one strains get control Although HAAAAAATE fact GOP politicians downplayed virus months getting vaccine, least shows “elites” regardless political affiliation support vaccine annoyed “masks aren’t proven help” “wtf obviously masks work, stupid?”. He’s fucking tool PM health department would disclose employer is. Fatality rates everything are, IMHO, short-sighted measure. parents wearing masks either get. parents say study hard, recycle plastics, say please thanks..are ones passively spread anti-mask sentiments. weird, like it. think form anti-intellectualism negative effect realise Current timeline still shows April, less six months. hope. That’s thought.  really interesting thing (I say this, anxiety, someone sure experience it) mild PTSD us who've taking seriously face. live alone, relatively isolated since March, I'm already talking plants forgotten unclasp bra. 

Reintegration going tough. I'm talking Shawshank Redemption tough, know I'm going uncomfortable first time go concert surrounded hundreds unmaksed people. Ironically local college elephant mascot. Yes hope carefree wingnuts infect someone love. know spend money ahead time right?

Sure. thats investment moron. That's pre-purchase.

Also? US pre-order shit. simply committed buying came out. Which, spoiler alert, would done anyway. buy pie 20 costs 5 make spend 15 improving recipes buying equipment ahead time make with.

Yep, that's happens customer purchases product. That's investment also part operation warp speed...

Awkward. Nope, Pfizer never took money us research. ""**This contract research development (R&amp;D)**"". don’t Best part, downtime Seasons, could binge non-stop shit show... Excuse me, 1 million Americans partially vaccinated Coronavirus, since Pfizer vaccine needs double dose. Pathetic. gets closer shots... strain wipe human race nah? 70%  need help people. Monday went birthday girl covid recently said ten days, new covid exam lack symptoms quarantine. 10 days ended Sunday. Monday birthday still coughing bit, like every 3 minutes, sneezes rough voice. birthday, sometimes eating coughing mask. 
I freaked pretend mad. family angry me, made uncomfortable evaluating skipping Christmas place. 

I'll quick exam tomorrow, hospital said 85% success rate. 

I really want know: 
Have overreacted? saw symptoms, imagined clear roam around.
How high risk got (I kept bit distance birthday)?
Was really clear?

Thanks, in-law facing huge family drama maybe contamination vacations beginning. Don’t know got downvoted, true lot places it’s dysfunctional. create campaign involves bunch burly good ol boys challenging masculinity anti vaxxers calling snow flakes democrats unless get vaccine prove badass Rambo like are.

BOOM! Problem solved. literally killing get vaccine. added bonus, sell truck nuts says GOT VAX'D generate extra revenue.

I take $250 mil now. well, work also expensive consider everyone needs two doses vaccine?
I sure large first batch was. copy human dosing using horse variety. cheap scale give correct mass paste use.

Are familiar ingredients equine paste? assume must list percentage Ivermectin paste, then, saying this. Thanks! released data yet make weaker, means passed threshold 50%, vaccines. may well come little lower others known yet. using correctly. can’t vaccinate everybody crazy parents don’t think it’s safe wild conspiracy theories going head. Gave humane angle argument easily, huh?

Ecoli salmonella constantly happening within US, seeing Trump rolled back meat processing regulations gutted budget food safety inspections, still think arguing purely sinophobic standpoint, originally argument Chinese less humane, less clean. 

And again, must ask, specific scientists accusing abandoning data favor personal opinions? mentioned Swedish scientist. name? Oh gosh terrible her. 😣 end eating whatever convenient food longer enjoyable. may even eat calorie dense foods get meals quicker. appetite want feel hunger. Well, actually much dangerous aren’t treating way. Okay this. quiet unsafe conditions? 

If nurse tells unsafe, respond “hmm- people might hate speak up”? 

Fuck people feel, peoples lives stake, I’m pretty sure care surviving unpopular right now. mean got first shot. Cooooool, meeeeeeeeee. new normal crowd punching air right anyone considered possibility mutations much spreading across improbably distances like South Africa UK simply arising lots places since minimal modifications confer slight fitness advantage, potentially higher viral load children? No, can't agree. figure shows 2020 11th December, means bound jump least 5% higher end year, put 94k total year higher every full year graph. explained previous time tried use graph last week. Totally. Seems like inevitable place weve wound news business venture. polyethylene glycol may culprit. Listening people savvy science- apparently someone minor allergic reaction past, encountered could cause severe reaction. COVID back September. sister tested positive today exposed her. anyone know protocols following? normal risk? can't flip switch.

They scared crap half population. people going anywhere without vaccine even high risk. people administering dose fixed rate. would spend half time giving 2nd doses instead initial doses, reducing rate initial doses (which reported here). think that's far tell. guess made initial sign narrow. vaccinating main hospital bunch satellite offices couple smaller hospitals. guess lot people would eligible able sign first days took slot worked schedule. Good intentions think underestimated could handle.

And yeah, kind annoyed reporting aspect.. Another really weird thing - one friends volunteering telling actually getting 7 doses per vial. apparently confusion whether vials 5 6 doses telling ones received 7. Can't confirm see would make haha  I've watched much netflix quarantine, system thinks I've lost sense taste entirely. No, believe so. Take pinch salt, biologist attempted understand can.

The vaccine spike protein itself, i.e. thing provides easy access cells makes infectious. mRNA effectively provides instructions body create spike protein, point immune system sees unknown protein says 'fuck boys!' gets work. new strains use spike protein, believe do, current vaccine work - although I'm sure affects efficacy. good timing me. Probably 150M people ahead me, depending number anti-vaxxer mfers lack access medical care Alaska makes vital communities Oh yes...Bednar's rant speaks volumes church feels close temples ward buildings. /s case sarcasm clear Great, could figure get warehouses people's arms would set. last couple weeks smooth. give week Michigan makes national headlines absolutely botching vaccine effort. Given many immigrants work medical industry, title tad inaccurate. hate point plague Inc. Better evolve coma neuroticism way 1@1/2 dose regim approved general use long trials it...they stick 2 full doses dont understand adamant closing them. Yes children need face 2 face contact schools online learning ready go time compared last. Instead government threaten sue schools wanted close week early, week experience normally spent watching films Xmas activities absolutely science behind it. 

should fit right rest COVID nonsense then! 329 million go enough people wear properly Yup, anything 70% huge help wipe pandemic. better options everybody, viable vaccines better. yes. get Oh yes you’re right. Maybe information come point. you’ve covid it’s still recommended get vaccine scientists aren’t sure long antibodies last. recommendation wait 90 days get vaccinated. Lockdown works well three times exposed nearly two weeks ago I've days little coughing/sneezing/headaches, way knowing covid allergies I'm staying home ordering food online contact delivery. didn't, tell I'd feel embarrassed.

Numbers rose throughout lockdown, numbers went dropped, time countries lockdown. can't look graphs European countries go ""lockdown, lockdown, lockdown, lockdown"". point.

Like said, I'm sorry confused you. mind mostly things day Christmas. one wants that. hospitalizations deaths drop like rock right people vaccinated. going go little, half. They'll go huge amount.  work Walgreens cash price Pfizer first dose like $11.99 want work unsafe conditions? 

Did say that? didn't. using [Bloomberg's says many doses distributed administered Meanwhile, heard NPR DeSantis hard-lining senior citizens would first line, period...ahead ""front-line workers.""

Don't get wrong: elderly right terms need...but fighting figurative trenches. Grandma grandpa probably stay home wait weeks...medical personnel? much.

If cynic, I'd think DeSantis thirsty votes. know, wish said specifically allergies had. sure still trying figure triggering reaction, specific allergies allergies coupled additional factors. 327 million go. made haphazard compared Canada's? understand Trump charge, made haphazard compared Canada? people government representing hundreds thousands people each. I'm sorry important healthy. sick and/or incapacitated miss vote disenfranchises hundreds thousands millions people senator. country attacked crisis need top elected officials military healthy alert ready action. Millions depend them. Capital idea! (see huehuehuehue) profits? killing economy  convince anything--feel free give jab right now. bigot unwilling change opinion. happily reassess position based new data. probably not, probably bigoted Read he’s receiving Remdesivir. 

Is study efficacy remdesivir? it, humans keep getting it. trying stumble debate, curious. Yes! parents older siblings 40s want get together. low risk work home Im sure worried them.  ""The AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine efficacy 62% trial participants given two full doses, 90% smaller sub-group given half, full dose"" hence get EUA data place wrong doses. 

The advantages vaccine: -4 -70 c refrigeration, easier produce much easier developing countries special refrigerators go low.

Also: effectiveness relates well treatment works practice, opposed efficacy, measures well works clinical trials laboratory studies Took second, thought referring Rita Wilson lol. It'll fine. take care own. rest sort out. Tom Hanks COVID likely still antibodies. antibodies later never gotten COVID entirely true. COVID patients die generally virus active entire stay hospital. I'm sure _help_ lot help ICU taking 5% chances turning 10% chances instance. 


Username case directly relevant hahaha. coronavirus subreddit. put negative thought every positive post. Get program. ""N.C.C. One Seven Oh One. bloody A, B, C, D."" Man, Tom Hanks really nice guy.

Why can't others genuinely nice like him? idiot comment post proud weren’t going get vaxed. that’s case? Conservatives cool million

sounds much average human being, actually pocket change want "" Use money invest future country listened science got vaccinated. "" another node mesh. affect vaccine? Agreed much. Since beginning pandemic even traveled outside county, hung friends, really cooped up. feel people hard time dealing that, sometimes there's important things amusement. sucks, would suck knew reason someone else today. certainly last thing would want would end one patients want bog healthcare system right now.

I wish people taking seriously work medical field deserve much better! guys bust ass day day what? lot people (Not all, significant amount) plain flat selfish think anyone else themselves. I've seen PTSD people sucks :( really worry healthcare workers.  Fauci consult experts reddit, though? 20,000,000 people December

we wont even hit march Half immunized. I'm gonna try encourage many people vaccinate possible. thing literally going bring world back normal. Let ask though, earth flat? Nurses replaced much easier realize. Fuck jobs. Viruses used weapons since humans began colonizing other. Global warming means faster viral mutations. course pandemics, makes travel privilege. government wants us vilify Russia China fuck us over. Politicians given priority vaccine. hate lung scarring too. Surprisingly, yes. Health care providers don’t strike first resort. unions provide least 10 days notice allow time mitigate administration unsafe practices (and prep case strike goes through). Pre-strike, task force RNs prep transfers, help phase process, conduct measures ensure continuity care. Also strike (usually short lived), another nurse task force assesses patient care “tag in” necessary.

These nurses striking staff *and* patient safety. they’re asking things like: adequate ppe testing; putting elective surgeries hold (for staff/equipment availability reduce patient infections); hospitals increase staff patient ratios “new normal”. using data supplied Florida? know that's shaky best. really care doctor says lockdown situation? Trump? though Pfizer Moderna distribution plans?

I’m sure president messed private company logistics say problem? Healthcare worker high levels contact covid patients lol Yes.

Source: science  yourself.... Merry Little COVID..... l upvote Bing Bong City Since I’m not, LA county compare Orange rolling 14 day? hospitals cancelled elective surgeries MONTHS ago. beds taken others need them. another article posted last week profit hospital nurses wanting strike, sure series hospitals, so, TON could do. hospitals care bottom line, staff patients. 

My husband nurse state hospital pretty clear could make nurses lives easier: 
1. 3 12 hour shifts changed. norm many hospitals staff work 3 12 hour shifts week. reduce shifts 8-10 hours add another .5 1 day onto schedule staff rest put PPE. Wearing full PPE EXHAUSTING. 
2. Patient load needs spread evenly. works med surg patient limit 5. Often times gets multiple patients critical care, they're capacity end unit. He'll 2-3 critical care patients nurses floor none. insanely dangerous could avoided spreading load. 
3. Orders get put within hour shift change fall next shift nurses. Putting tests nurse's shift 20 minutes pushes back charting paperwork often results staying extra 30-90 minutes working 12 hour shift. 
4. Mandate breaks lunch time. Many nurses busy time use bathroom, get drink, even eat lunch. mandated. Hire traveling nurses fill time slots floor nurses take breaks. probably happen traveling nurses paid lot hospitals either want to, can't afford to, hire pay them.

These things could handled differently make lives nurses little bit easier. experience nursing, pretty easy say anything done. hospitals rarely run efficiently. Nurses sign martyred asking work exhausting unsafe conditions fair anyone. person needs imprisoned. sure that? real question degree. FUCKING TWEET Snow banks? *Laughs West coast southern Ontario* website trends... need computer, mobile. Type county, hit Get county data, it'll show graph reported cases particular county along rolling 14 day average. units American acute care hospital 8 9 patients,

Lol. idea talking about. 

That LITERALLY happening now. Sorry Cases blowing well Thanksgiving. Midwest full Anti-masker rednecks haven’t followed safety protocols since day one.

What’s likely occurring early stages [viral resistant phenomenon shall named].  Got mine yesterday. arm quite sore morning starting get better now. little fatigue nothing major. awesome there's already 1 million vaccinated Oh. Great point. Since never seen it, *must* neither real worth concern. 🙄

Yea. fucking troll. work blood research studies can't know. 

And either actually work healthcare, forged license, work worst fucking hospital country. way goes clue wtf actually talking kids meant said ""first worst"" humans. Unpopular opinion, think good reserving people get second dose proper time frame.

I'm sure large part due logistics issues, that's expected. Fuck you. Can't use technology change vaccine work new strains? Kind like flu vaccine different flu variants? neither major political party wants put money actually solving major issues lead homelessness America. strongly advocate cheap housing homeless simply fallen hard times &amp; need address get new job. believe would help even scratch surface majorly drives homelessness country: mental illness addiction. got rid asylums due rampant abuse terrible pay employees instead decided let mentally ill individuals loose streets look way. sordid past asylums, aren’t allowed even discuss solutions helping homeless mentally ill addicted. It’s real cluster fuck. nah talking october cleared phase 2 trials, bare minimum even lenient fast tracking administration. depends hits market first, pfizer moderna could drastically affected cold chain distribution. -70C joke, fragility pfizer vaccines make complicated store transport. 

nobody wants risk losing batch, countries infrastructure. huge markets like india buying moderna, one non mRna solutions stable standard refrigeration reason theyre safe. asked theyre testing children, said no. Everybody received vaccine administers vaccine two people know Why? curious. disproportionate people African-Americans. wrong you? Damn sister smoke show No. fact. loss, mine. I've enjoyed additional traveling year. really nice getting cheap rates hotels. 

Just anticipate shutting every years new coronaviruses appear. think second last one. Guarantee every communist country world people trying develop next Covid-19. Sure vaccine free, costs, employer like mine provides health insurance could hook costs. Yes does, mean people get second dose, means reserve second dose national storage. supply chain reason dose reserve unless expect supply chain disruption larger size stored amount. 5m reserve means need somewhat likely 5m unit delay supply chain. information suggests delay. real, author blog post[tweeted NEJM longer \*/roll eyes/\* do, never seen it. ? many 1 million said COVID hoax ""the flu"" ran office republican last year? powers haven’t figured get paid yet? nj.

Or maybe layer google maps something. know -- Republican senators representatives seem getting it. Yo, got $30 gram. itch don' go away, give next gram half price. Got first dose Pfizer Saturday. felt anything all. Painless injection, soreness, side affects all. We'll see second dose brings three weeks. pace giving (1m week) half decade anyway vaccinate country. 

We’ve got 10 million dosages sitting shelves right complete total failure federal state government roll shit out. 

There’s excuse 8-months couldn’t mass vaccinate approval day. sit millions doses go unused talking many million going make. 50% isn’t bad virtually cases circulating. criticism original question? seeing US rn? lockdowns holidays days away. least UK there’s attempt containing it. Thats true point people exposed either vaccine direct sickness immune systems still may react level. problem, why? 

If costs economy X dollars insufficient number people taking vaccine, dollars bribe sufficient people take vaccine, long X much larger Y, bribing people correct solution. Labour would remotely better. They'd call border controls racist, refuse anything school transmission fear impact education.

Right, California massive population relative states. per capita cases significant statistic. sue anyone getting harmed Corona virus either. O, Canada... miss it.

Your patience politeness noted. makes laugh -- kind way -- characterization cause division US: ""The breakdown proper guidance."" Here, US (where Democratic ""left-leaning"" party leftist Conservatives), much blunter truth it, immune subtlety nuance, also we've subjected deliberate policies denial dismissiveness, object always amplify divisiveness. led assholes, neither care 'proper', 'guidance'. 

Canada problems, fabric social responsibility existed US long time. And, fact, existed here, monumental attempts rend fabric tiny strips light fire. 

One day -- soon must -- might learn, imitate neighbors north. rednecks, rednecks. white supremacists, white supremacists. politicians want amplify worst among us, nullify social responsibilities. can't even say phrase ""social responsibilities"" US without causing furore ""socialism"" half 330Million people. That's dumb we've made ourselves.

Also, plenty masks medical equipment beginning, twin-headed dragon federally-sponsored hyper capitalism created artificial shortage monetized stuff, multiplied insider trading government officials. nation condoned profiteering time crisis, citizens valuable chemicals reduced to.

The division US deliberate, borne ignorance, bored greed, hate, politics fear.

Understand anger language way directed you, telling truths, and, perhaps, trying take barbs truths respect living them.

One checked box? single day week trend? website doesn’t trends. Days go different entities don’t report every day. That’s silly way collect manage data. It’s like there’s “give shot person, press button” data systems. want focus cohorts groupings large data set like this. Economies scale apply data well. think *has* new strain spreads easily. think there's much change people. people still cautious hell, people still breaking rules. know else could be. Wow. Free? That's good hear.
In country already fixed prices United tried spin ""medical emergency"" Covid knew Covid. Lol. Why? human life less important business profits? What's person called realizes they're biased called?

It said vaccine within year unrealistic. 

And much 18m going people whose 'pajamas' scrubs uniform get holidays off. Yep unheard especially comes things bed block, rooms requiring cleaning, staff reallocate patients several different rooms etc. starting blood transfusion hallway unheard of. enough housing house everyone. Landlords leaving houses apartments empty people can't pay rent want charge. disgusting  Unfortunately never true death rate Covid, since transparency Covid deaths counted. Dying dying COVID-19 may require complex investigation cause death, beyond citing positive SARS-CoV-2 test completed prior person’s death. Looking pictures dailymail see woman clearly obese bring list health issues. I’m denying COVID exists dangerous, everyone view reports critically always face value. Trump bought twenty million doses, even offered much more. Agreed. feel genuine. ""According Transportation Security Administration, air travel surpassed 1 million daily passengers U.S. throughout weekend Christmas, despite warnings Centers Disease Control Prevention.""

Just, why? data backup claim? May difficult, least DeSantis administration ordered districts stop releasing school specific coronavirus information, citing privacy issues. happy report, one 1 million! Counting 28 days booster!    I'm undermining severity pandemic man fucking exhausting past months reading article every day ""new wave"" coming way. Yeah Mom thinks way! I’m driving 3 hours throws fit! One studies worked support look blood types outcomes critically ill covid patients first surge, yes. large nationwide (US) registry study various levels hospitals, provided equipped critical care patients. 

Honestly, would reread manuscript, bc scanned abstract shared. recall outcome/conclusion, otherwise would (and can) share. 

You could possibly find scholar.google.com searching ""stop covid"" main author David Leaf. date, study resulted in, think 6 7 manuscripts. might pay access them, though. I'm sure. likely, would like happens flu vaccines won’t need lengthy trials, go basic regulatory assessment. whole registration process today LIH testing site, came back appointments...maybe I’ll try again. site one said “Appointment Recommended, Required” - walk in? thank 🙏🏻 right deff get worried bc im used long recovery like ur right one day time, stayin positive staying healthy help body heal takes maybe 30 seconds get shot. Dude even sayi- скачать бесплатно программы регистрации игры на бесплатно...? be. Masking hand hygiene deep 2021 mainstay, like viral respiratory infection completely agree! Many patients, including white patients, feel complain heard, it’s particularly hard ration care right now. HibernateMeBot here! hibernation period 20 days elapsed. 

*I bot message performed automatically* need industry mass produce vaccines. Scale up. also think need scale waste water testing catch outbreaks become seen. massive opportunities make money helping world. Hopefully someone means make happen. Maybe tweet Elon Bezos. Yes, would safe vaccinated twice. weird post. point here? 

If get Covid physically fit, young, exercise eat right, think buying myth. Anyone catch virus. get really sick. 

If upset friend caught Covid yet even though meet standards healthy, think need take step back. ignore stuff don’t like enjoy parts like. don’t believe everyone’s opinion Internet. lol what? also proportionally less resources/people conduct vaccinations Thank much! feel like I’m finally able something likely *actually* make difference. assuming linear growth administration silly. 3 days ago sub commented post US 500,000 one week. three days later 1 million. comment showing even assuming 25% growth vaccinations/week would vaccinating 14 million/week end March 500,000 7 days 1,000,000 10 days basically doubling administration rates (or 100% growth vaccinations/week) 100,000,000 end March seems realistic point, possibly even conservative. pandemic people eating unregulated street vendor hot dogs driving buzzed home taking Xanax drinking alcohol. people washed 18 seconds instead 20 quarantine wear masks then? Cite sources. getting 7%? seems sensible me. Part reason we've struggled badly measures we've taken 'half-way house' mentality. 'Better collectively take pain months much better chance able control around March time, keep trying give bit interests simply end going 'round endless cycles opening up, restrictions, opening on.

As say, three months hard slog everyone vaccinated meantime. ageeed! ive using example young friends like pleasee u guys want shit! like course greatful im ICU still don’t understand virus generalize say doesnt effect us bc young dangerous  Great insights! ""mutation"" ""strain"" different? new strain would actually concerning usually test near Escondido you’re talking San Marcos, CA. Try LHI Care, one county testing providers. appointments become available rolling basis, keep checking back see get something. 

48-72 hours results max, testing since August. 10 minutes usually. also locations Hemet Temecula don’t mind extra half hour driving.

Also, county drive testing Oceanside take 3-5 hours wait time, recommend. fucked understand saying, I'm asking feel way preventable/semi-preventable conditions, Covid. I’ve become even cynical that. think people don’t give offering online services one sees put envelope offering plate. minister pretty lucrative career even medium sized church. Whole thing straight scam. Seriously, like everything said accurate shit lmao  I've too. Got yesterday afternoon, felt super tired time went bed. Lethargic today arm felt like punched Tyson. Nothing else though, pretty minor things considered. I've heard argument buy (in current incentive exchange things like children

What even mean? Kids expensive shit; always financial incentive children. saying one would paid top that? opposite true; government provide financial incentives people kids (in form tax credits, etc.).

I agree everything comes back money. know killing middle class keeping poor really going benefit rich long run. Antibodies drop - role t-cells? recall, studies SARS shows t-cells ramped production antibodies fairly quickly. reinfection really issue there’s quick neutralizing antibody response? need Vanya Umbrella Academy. probably mostly measure homogeneous health care is. Even don’t, print deal later. approach Canada. Trudeau fast tracked Covid relief benefits first $2000 cheques sent March. possible touched contaminated surface? people immune response that's line see viruses. long lasts open ended question due long around. 7% immune response seem diminished type interferon response virus beginning. leads rapid viral seeding lungs, leads migration monocyte derived macrophages lungs rather alveolar macrophages cleaning viruses up, leads neutrophilia lungs leads hyperinflammatory responses. Th1 Th2 cell ratio goes skewed toward Th1 drives hyperinflammation. Then, B cell response also becomes inflammatory start releasing tons neutralizing antibodies antibodies tend derived extrafollicularly (meaning memory). 

So, really hyperinflammatory responses drive lack long term immunity generated first place. air exchange systems exactly shit you’re nearby Covid positive person. catch outside, definitely catch tiny skybox. state priorities straight, actually caring education. vaccines rest us. Sorry, want face want vaccine, can't force them. T-cells still around. History won't. Sure best thing needing urgency risk spreading community.  Even said fomite transmission rare, still wipe packaged groceries let non perishables sit garage need them.  research covid blood types? Yeah, there's way I'm going put risk people vaccinated. Even young get mild case, permanent heart, lung, brain damage. wish people would wake realize this. Agreed, countries exactly Nah get tinfoil hat — Wally World’s pharmacy even name brand one. Meanwhile still waiting africa, mainly poor.

Pretty sure mess somehow. lot recent times unfortunately. Sure vaccinate earth moon crashing it? situation, would say go. risk greater health issues ignoring dental emergencies. 

To reassure yourself, call dentist ask go Covid protocol inform precautions need take end.

Hope feel better! Hahaha hit head Everybody everywhere. It’s kind ridiculous. know bunch people think sick anything last winter, OMG, Covid. Oh, felt really bad day February nothing since? Yeah, bad cold. Get vaccinated. loss tragic physician works hospital question story. would expect given pain medication “pulmonary infiltrates”? People Covid great deal discomfort one getting opiate pain medications pain associated Covid-19. 

Also, “new pulmonary infiltrates” criteria hospital admission. hospitals full around country. keep critically ill Covid patients hospitalized (hypoxic), everyone else goes home, even radiologically visible pulmonary infiltrates. hospital based physician would know that. 

I could completely wrong sounds awfully like patient getting treatment everyone else expecting treated VIP. Mistreatment happens sure none points add discrimination. physicians hospitals treat patients book, literally. meet criteria stay, otherwise go home. that’s insurance companies demand us. 

I’ve dealt hospitalized medical workers difficult patients. It’s shocking see medical system patient point view used side. precisely need stimulus money avoid spread. admire positivity loathe naivity White people pay. 250 suspected reinfections Indiana. Close 500,000 confirmed cases. Multiply antibody studies actual tests you’re looking 2 million total cases state. 250 suspected reinfections versus 2 million total cases. Sorry, excited this! 1500. got mild covid March sick 2 weeks kinda sick 4 weeks, relapses symptoms continuing til off. got gradually better though. think early worry much. One day time! good news, still couple years front us till lockdowns turned bit. doubt things like restaurants anything fun social humans exist anymore 9 billion got vac, humans awesome species recover that, even none us expieriencing it, ones making happen, HEROES point. Enjoy left used know point eyes towards future. take MRT everyday work. rarely see people mask nose. never see anyone mask beneath chin. I've personally forgotten put mask always stopped gate. One time removed mask bathroom forgot put back on. immediately reminded someone escalator. journalists didn’t pass high school science clickbaiting hard point. Yes viruses mutate. panic worthy every single time  Real reason three-day workweek. Dad caught church one damned ministers. barely got sick gave Mom ended hospital. pulled I’m still pretty mad it. Masks also protect reducing initial viral load. provides two benefits:

1. Reducing risk getting sick.
2. Reducing risk serious get sick. could lead serious complications across population due undertested vaccine rushed through, there's reason high testing requirements decided go French Laundry. I’m also needle phobic person/nurse passes out. Talk person giving shot. Ask let laying head slightly lower feet, lay min two. Slowly test sitting seeing feel gradually standing. Sure takes little longer, haven’t passed since started neither patients say always faint. 

I received Moderna vaccine today, honestly tell didn’t even feel needle tiny bit fluid injected. It’s little 12 hours arm sore lifted gym. 

Good luck! this! implying killed trouble maker?

Haha yeah def should*! Hazard f job. Nurses still lower risk rates normal circumstances many professions vaccinations important allow people sue someone them.  think false. mean 1 million doses? Ever heard fake IDs? imagine nurses well trained spotting fakes. 50% efficacy rate minimum standard set U.S. regulators emergency authorization Covid vaccines. Messenger RNA vaccines Moderna Inc. Pfizer Inc. produced far better results, reducing symptomatic Covid cases well 90% giant trials.

Don't worry, did. Should**unfortunate typo haha definitely keep wearing masks That's pretty reasonable. ppl die, beds available. Symptoms. time, people joked it. laughed, bronchitis! didn’t go away. Bronchitis always goes away.

Once people get vaccine get people accept lockdown anymore. think civil disobedience bad fringe people?

That's also assuming things go according plan start much wider roll out. easy make things go smoothly trying vaccinate 1% population versus 50 60%. also able change things data whether virus continues able spread viably vaccination received, particularly 70% population inoculated (or per Anthony Fauci interview FiveThirtyEight). good deed. great deed, good one know else foundation donating where. Ask people gave zero dollars charity hunger. Holy fuck uneducated Article December contains relevant information apparent lack post-Thanksgiving ""surge"". happening pretty simple: hospitals filling up, admitting fewer fewer people. doctor nurse tell demand beds soars, threshold admission rises it.  
The decision whether admit patient depends two things: clinical judgment bed availability. Critically ill patients always admitted. hospitals start fill up, less sick — younger covid patients, whose oxygen levels aren’t yet dangerously low — get sent home. patients would safer hospital bed, isn’t one available anymore. doesn’t happen covid patients. People show hospital heart failure, wound infections ailments asked manage conditions home, doctors keep remaining beds sickest patients.
 
&amp; best calculation, third half covid-19 patients would hospitalized beginning October sent home instead. really bad patients. get much sicker home. may die there. Ohhh shit. makes American tech?

Beyoncé! patience! rollout going one greatest logistical efforts decades — can’t expect everything go top speed day one.

There’s going slow start, there’s going delays, there’s going stupid decisions every level, there’s going wastage, there’s going inefficiency. It’s foolish expect otherwise logistical operation magnitude.

As progress, we’re going get faster, we’re going move efficiently smoothly. Less two weeks ago, wasn’t even single vaccine authorized use United States. Since then, we’ve already innoculated million people. That’s impressive itself, it’s going get faster. Better 5g cell reception, perhaps?  disparity also showing wide gap previous version virus? 1 million folks vaccinated 12 days since Emergency Use Authorization better nothing, absolutely, comes 580,000 per week average. average, it'll take 7 years full herd immunity protection (\~75% population, \~235 million Americans) achieved. performance also benefited recipients healthcare workforce, closely tied institutions built vaccinations; I'd expect performance decline vaccinates offered folks increasingly outside networks.

Meanwhile virus ravaging citizens causing incalculable tolls economy. best way honor absolute dedication scientists involved rapid development vaccine deploying effectively humanly possible. Every investment effort must made get current stockpile willing folks' arms, sparing expense. honors dead, protects living, respects every ounce hard work already spent. responding part people sub downers. extremely clear conversation went...? I’m done here. wasted enough time arguing something ultimately meaningless. good one. see real change end February.

By 60+ population medical staff vaccinated.  1-in-1000 number, that's bit higher would expected,” said Dr. Justin Lessler, infectious disease specialist Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health, COVID-19 cases closely tracked worldwide. “I think worrying signal potential long-term immunity perfect.”

That's difference somebody studies infectious disease somebody studies data analytics. guy

Probably ready sprints hit, I’m getting back routine. weights feel little heavier, also haven’t worked bit. hypothetical circumstance South African strain resists vaccine (I know folks saying unlikely, I'm hearing it'll take weeks sure) want know, exactly would put us?

People 65, people serious co-morbidities

Usually death rate covid cited .01-.2% 65. It’s range it’s based IFR (mortality people infected) obviously everyone disease tested total number infections estimate. story sources study Indians lists IFR .26% excluding nursing home patients (even exclusion average age death 76.9): .26% study still doesn’t take account young people co-morbidities, vaccinating drops even more.

Flu mortality rate generally around .05% according cdc numbers, low end covid numbers excluding 65+ year olds don’t believe large part treatments covid like tamiflu insanely high level community spread

Yes do. Crazy tell political affiliation sarcastic comment.

Unfortunately, nobody heeding warning. Stores packed, freeways full...It’s going tragic winter. think American. sound like offended lol $50,000 bank, would equivalent donating $62. original comment thread talking said roll quickly January came back saying unlikely. took mean saying masks shit 2022 mistake. Wide spread vaccines happen summer lucky. Even mid 70s parents told expect late March best.  like everyone else

I wish halfway joking, legit tin foil? aluminum foil mostly replaced tin foil WW2, aluminum foil block space/quantum radio waves quite well tin does. Oh cone man, need man. Can't like, give deal something? I've already got fever shakes everything. I'm literally dying man. I'm good money, know am. I'll pay next Wednesday, promise man, please? reported 28,200 coronavirus cases, sequenced 58.6 percent, highest rate worldwide.

We sequence virtually every case days, provides invaluable info contact tracing, get confident they've figured whole transmission graph/family tree leaks quarantine.

Which every then, sadly.  There's nothing draconian restrictions also people follow. lockdown name only. US sequenced third tests compared UK though, significantly smaller given population size. Larger samples mean see far emergent variants, also clearer picture demographic factors (e.g. like UK see seems affecting children more). get good shit? seem like cool hobby have. use fair amount eggs course year. Hell would give money take spot. would feel guilty give shot parents someone old lol. Administering vaccines...

152d 13h 37m 33s remaining get taxes everything closes though? simply give business owner public spending sector suffer consequence agree it’s foolish assume came anywhere China, though I’m sold lab release theory. fact is, humans encroaching nature more. bats humans meet, happens. Generally speaking people don’t spontaneously assemble start making vaccines. corporation organize direct action workers. fact making contribution. doesn’t mean drug companies haven’t done bad things.
Other models might possible better, instance appear done **a** good thing. people corporations deserve credit making vaccines happen. Incorrect, sorta. real number 0.12% 19 15180 patients. 

He quoting fever all. fever basically expected, worrying adverse reaction. immune system works. 

They recorded persistent is, fever lasting 7 days total 19 people 15180 vaccine patients. detailed contact tracing studies countries like South Korea though far indication even single case fomite transmission. example would infected person attends church service someone subsequent church service sat pew gets infected. recent case study South Korea found infection occurred 21 feet away restaurant said used security video verify surfaces touched people, meaning fomite transmission something they’re looking for.

Maybe change weather cools, it’s clear far fomite transmission pretty rare isn’t people forgetting often touch face. Pfizer formula. experience almost identical. me, soreness lasted 3 days, didn’t impede movement daily tasks. annoying sleep side. 3 day? would take forever Two FDA approved vaccines year definitely record time. gotta ask: claiming interested pharmacology zero idea vaccines work point? They’ve transparent throughout development trials tech behind drugs. proprietary stuff Acuitas’s lipid nanoparticle delivery system, rest mRNA tech straightforward: cut piece COVID’s genetic code gives best antibody response, force cells manufacture protein, like real infection would look like immune system, without ability replicate sites may generate auto-antibodies (like we’ve seen actual Covid infections N protein).

That’s 10 grade levels news media reports at, you’re going research want disagree scientists media’s quoting. average person would hear go “They’re gonna infect COVID? thanks.” Yeah 0 vaccinated people austria far, even 1 million doses till march fair countries list really matter would nothing data anyways. 5-7 months usually closer 7. buy laying hens already producing, used cheap; Covid went $35 each. TBH recommend Covid; space already raise garden might something would like. came Wuhan. It’s absolutely virus originated China. You’re looking US China vacuum saying “well Americans nearby.” look entire planet. China isolated China weeks began crop elsewhere. would identified earlier transmission (not estimates confirmed transmission) came first. would rest planet. Wow way then...that’s huge difference Unfortunately isn’t true. There’s island community near Seattle bunch affluent liberals refuse vaccinate kids “do research” Facebook. one lowest vaccination rates country. Without ending mental issue seen pandemic ER. trump also remove lot funding science/medical based stuff? NASA got less funding to? 2021 bad. least first. Half FDNY polled said would take vaccine.

Those folks forced forgo hospital treatment fall ill, signing agreement happening woman's gravesite. heard microchip glows. Try going dark room look travels veins! Great protect them. Hope stay safe healthy! vaccine gonna work new strain UK? Wtf alaskans 25% less effective. 6x less effective (5% chance Biontech/moderna) vs 38% chance AZN/Oxford suppose 20 million...this concerning... many power ball lotto tickets buy expecting 1 292,201,338 wins. vid told good 3 months, really want buy ticket possibility getting again. almost 40 days still days, like today, feel like I'm drowning. I'm pretty healthy middle aged male ran lifted. Now, I'm two inhalers, scheduled breathing test tomorrow. statisticians could maybe shed light data.

If sequencing 0.3% positive tests adequate contact trace play even understanding many different strains there? I'm assuming not?

Same goes country 10%? country masks celebrated everyone wants wear forever? Genuinely curious! Also objection don’t like believe right show face *once public health crisis control* Sorry, getting Mexican-American? article say anything that. controversial point view sub. People need minimize contact people.  How's doctor gonna know??? state company yet provide solid clinical evidence efficacy.

Neet. US started giving people flu shot saying Covid vaccine. could march. 10MM vaccinated UK September!   retarded. there's that. imagine thinking everybody catches die? that's is. go crappy 62% full-full regiment way-too-small-sample-size-but-hopefully-90% half-full regimen? Cases New Zealand almost exclusively came overseas limited community transmission.

So cluster cases different overseas origin really got brand covid here. reason lower % would due could link cases together i.e close contacts point testing.

In UK places yes probably get overseas variants covid 100% stuff highly likely mutated origin point there. think joke tested little UK definitely adequate contact trace system place way knowing clusters together people picking up. wat happy new year... beginning next week. NYT article mentions told team short breath doctor argued wasn't.

I also physician inclined believe truth lying. also inclined take seriously another physician, black, feels something wrong way treated. Screw feelings. ones started this... 


Now must ones stop *the world* mean USA, right? No, statement made. made statement one 45 died Covid, 100% false. People literally want stir shit online. That’s all. vast vast majority people want “normal” life work towards it.  What’s estimate normal, middle aged people aren’t risk aren’t teachers essential ? want beer, sit favorite local bar. like thinking. hate them. conduct research publicly funded universities, run away results start companies, becoming billionaires expense people funded efforts . fair world income would Taxed. sister sounds cool. Yeah worthless article. Mutations news demonstrate likely higher contagion competing strains (ie UK strain), demonstrate higher fatality demonstrate resistance vaccine (which none yet) Yeah, I’d say that’s fair assessment. Well that's nonsense optimal care point view. 12 hour shifts lead worse care mistakes tired people lose focus. Probably cheaper hospitals. awesome. Shalom 100% doable. already explained cases marked covid died complications. Even 300K, I'm concerned 22 veterans kill day. Yes going at, US might meet quota doesn’t mean every community will. Pretty much poorer areas country, inner cities rural areas risk people unvaccinated. 
Headline is: 
**Utah ICUs 99.4% capacity, state reports 2,408 new COVID cases 8 deaths** yet... God killed racist. racist kids. “It may necessary greatly accelerate vaccine rollout.”

We anyway. ain't doable I’ll give props Trader Joe’s Aldi’s clean practical. figure 10 minutes N95 mask meteor risk territory COVID.

How long take getting chickens getting usable eggs them?

I know nothing keeping chickens. entire world GREATLY benefits US Pharma. hate them, extremely innovative. Countries like Canada company producing vaccine...they even factories make vaccine. Virologist here. blown way proportion. currently concrete evidence transmissible. Also, calling ‘strain’ indicates developed different/new biological function viral replication. simply true. RNA viruses develop mutations every cell infect. isn’t different. took sequences across planet SARS-CoV-2, you’d see mutations everywhere.

Using computational modelling mutations spike protein, isn’t evidence makes mRNA vaccines less effective. 

Here’s another virologist commenting Obviously, bigger point workers, ""industry"". Still ain't worse rest US, including certain states certain color identifier often used (original comment auto-deleted...c'mon) restrictions officially acting like pandemic exist. explain we're second Tennessee hotspot even already leveled whereas still exploding (also East Bay here...I know single person social gatherings, saw anyone Thanksgiving, rarely beholden unmasked person, outdoors, 99% people even outdoors masked). Hate crime? wish rednecks, historical mistreatment, skepticism also much higher amongst Latinos African Americans. Los Angeles, example, 39% white, makes worry uptake. think enough people take it, justifiable fears groups addressed. Seriously?

You want us wait 2 years get involved another year ramp production? 

WWII hilarious example. using WWII example, well ahead relative mobilization schedule. We're #1! Good, good would attribute fact really celebrate christmas system slowed down. means I’ll get sooner. want know whether forced labor involved production distribution vaccines. Probably issue USA big deal poorer parts world.  Nearly 4 &amp; 10? Dafuq say approximately 1/3? That’s it? 

Just attention Fuck can’t wait see ""Some people say"", ""Many people say"" - Trump trick. reject hypothesis. full vaccination? I.e one done going require follow shots later on? .


If later think anythings changed all. There's concept called proximate cause, though. Someone accidentally causes house fire probably responsible damages house, cut-off responsibility series mistakes poor decision making leads whole town burning down. Cool, statement one age 45 died solely Covid 19 Canada. Meaning cause death listed death certificate. 100% true. Okay don’t know tell understanding it. rifle fully automatic semi automatic isn’t going change much. Besides that, legal 1984. Every citizen able anything government owns. 

Going back point 250-500 rpm equating 250-500 kids dead minute... hell would even work? Like honestly, c’mon. You’re better searching r/COVID19 information. studies linked prevalent estimating contagious is. remember, it’s 60% contagious original strain, dominant strain here. Don’t quote that, that’s think remember top head. 

You always ask weekly thread someone link relevant study. sitting cross legged day crotch starts stink. back casedemic? Yup. Mother mortality unusually high US. scary. I've told partner woman giving birth needs constantly advocating health mother doctors nurses neglect sake child. taking care child bad, lives need taken care equally, unfortunately USA life mother given enough attention birth. sites tracking vaccination numbers globally right now? heard Phienix next LA droves left LA  know venting, doesn’t seem like kind guy plan future with. know...he said something want get tested. thing kept saying knows family practices safe protocols like... like lives them. think believes since one family gotten infected everything fine.

It's quite irritating... still do. Ever watched video witnessed circumcision? horrible. definitely bias play statistics bear out. wrt mastectomy, given tylenol mine surprisingly fine.

Many businesses close first six weeks (no line credit). Every one working businesses lose job. gets bad.  Guessing aren’t California obviously without certain exceptions everything open ppl wearing masks. education know populace convinced free open healthcare socialism direct path communism. don’t want ignorance. want Christmas.... Well, didn’t say women better handling pain men, honestly don’t know that, don’t think either us make statement, unless wanna back up? Anyway, say women often ignored experiencing level pain man comparable situation: Doctors, nurses, healthcare worker valued enough. 

Really depressing. ever time, read Medical Apartheid, eye opening me.  world ended, see....

It's almost need public housing.  


Ironically - places people deem ""hyper capitalist"" like Singapore Hong Kong actually / world's best public housing models. they're trying say cried last like 6 injections I've gotten. bruh nuke valley filled 2 million desperate people Lol ok moron Seems sciene good supports hivemind's 

Also: says like 3 paragraphs article. 2.9 million go out, 2.9 million need reserved second shot, 500,000 case something happens. Matter time....Im surprised Nevada got first. want point it’s “wrote” “writed”.  like Clintons, despise trump minions. Hillary never intentionally allowed anyone die. Shit went way beyond scope control. Repubs arms, held hearings, make case actually blame. 

trump hand advance knowledge pandemic likely consequences, admitted much private (while record), yet publicly downplayed it, refused act, called fake democratic plot ""failed"" impeachment, generally acted official manner directly led thousands unnecessary deaths. officials Europe elsewhere similar blood hands, point party directly responsible hundreds thousands dead Americans never hold accountable way tried hold Hillary accountable deaths beyond control. worst kind hypocrites, devious deadly, trying claim moral high ground...

And broad generalization ""reddit thinks"" way reveals something beliefs... yeah pretty much. probably want catch Covid escape thier prison jobs end misery.

West LA VA Hospital: Pharmacy flagged medication mine didn’t show urinalysis I’d almost week. said system month. urologist step tell gets flushed 3 days. PCP apologized listening pharmacy. Note: patient flags staff see. 

LA County Health clinic: broke bone hand (metacarpal) receptionist told “if broke hand you’d pain”. sat another hour till saw doctor finally X-ray confirmed fracture. doctor referred ER get fractured placed cast. drove ER. 

Blood pressure readings: normally high blood pressure readings. high reading patient supposed sit calmly minutes get rechecked - RN removes normal size arm cuff regular sized arm place “THIGH” cuff (to intentionally lower reading - she’ll done BP reading). I've told repeatedly VA healthcare accepted places I've sought care. telling we're supposed able use places normally?

No one else catches it. public health fantastic job isolating correct people fast enough prevent wide spread infection. considering testing turn around still 3-4 days makes extra impressive.

Signed, 17 year Paramedic. Thursday healthcare worker told busy, got lunch. Mostly covid.  day heard one person say we're going get anyway, might well get with. ""Never attribute malice could attributed stupidity"" Ah, mystical ""racism exist I'm from!!!"" Point is, racism human issue, Western-specific issue

but okay guess 👍 I've insurance intervene treatment plans multiple occasions.

Dr. prescribes medication diagnosis X, insurance refuses filled, insists medications B, C, must attempted pay A.

Go thru B C D. Dr. Prescribes again. Insurance requests PCP refer specialist. I'd agree except A) nearly every candidate ran M4A platform election B) poll poll shows majority people, even conservatives, favor M4A least reform medical system. fact never seems get anywhere leaves who? entrenched political structure vast amt $$$ they're beholden to. don’t even care Bey Jay like that. Sure, gave us 500k scraps made million selling overpriced hoodies crap. 

My point being, really want help community - stop idolizing putting rich people pedestal. Use money help others, don’t give decide wanna it. aforementioned hypothetical 1 million overpriced hoodies/clothing. gave us half stole back us lol. trying showcase american food best world think grits, clam chowder, biscuits gravy that? US diversity food, mean American food. means US imperialist nation. like British claiming tea British. tea leafs came india, dishes china, sugar Americas. ass hole admissions office unicersity Amersterdam tell Indonesian food Dutch food colonized Indoesnia took back Netherlands long ago. No, looted imperialists accounting events labeled racist immediately without evidence attempt bully hospital demanded/giving pain medicine. Places like usa like 3000 deaths day.

Is 1500 deaths better. still bad. recall US built large public housing complexes back 1950's '60s. good places live; generally attracting crime, concentrating poverty certain areas.  demolished years.

I see would work better today. Unless mindset corralling underclass tenements ghettos acceptable solution. shouldn’t. *is* insane. Hey there, das rayces Im sure comments useful? US Covid relief bill includes 500 million dollars aid top usual 3.8 billion yearly aid Israel receives. 

Also Covid relief bill includes new law make streaming copyrighted material felony, punishable 5 years. thank North Carolina's Senator Thom Thillis adding one. Interesting updated things watch for. Seems negligent. 

Hoping get negative test. military, surgeon general play ck3, set crown authority high? go high partition / primogeniture rather confederate partition? put peasant rebellions overwhelming men arms send marshal subdue local population restore control? realise authoritarian that? Imagine government pressure EU decline hundreds millions Pfizer doses. America reels effects poor governance. Still mention vitamin D3. Given ten percent USA infected covid gonna take vacinations new virus strains circulating since September, think thats we're seeing exploding Covid spread around world. updated page. Yesterday said number doesn’t include Moderna like food killing people supporting healthcare system. Diet-related diseases number one killer America. reactive care preventative since lot people don’t even eat real food. know get forced... forced, free find job find business require vaccine decides take risk. Freedom 2 way street, sounds like \*removed healthy people?

What ""innocent"" anything? know know vaccines work, use healthy people either. Damn bro might need \*removed mods\* . love conclusion is, “When less covid community, less people die it.” A+ work there. 😂  Michelin rates based cities country.

This good metric means.

Their former Michelin stared chefs moved Chicago rural Michigan example. restaurants can't listed guide rate rural Michigan. Maybe like 800k ppl SF also significant Asian pop wears masks generally younger educated pop mutate anything like flu. Influenza amounts Lego bricks. mutate way, called reassortment. Take three stacks Legos, break open one, add pieces two. That's happened inside pig Mexico 2009.

This novel influenza feared. take shortcuts something novel transmissible humans. Merry Christmas/Happy holidays fellow covid nuts.  Omg defund Hospitals! BLM 

**Conclusion**

COVID-19 devastating health society broadly. Yet reason proud much medical progress, including upcoming vaccines monoclonal antibodies, well increased masking social distancing, made combat virus unknown end 2019. really difficult imagine 38% positivity rate. Without doubt things dire . wonder though selective testing whether reason high percentage positive tests. Remember side pushed hard lockdowns know poor bleak future administration changes. saved lives, dramatically lower hospitalization rates. 
The people risk hospitalized first true front line medical personnel (not administration/non-patient facing/non-clinic folks).
This simple. 

The virus causes logistical bottleneck point care leads deaths. Eliminate bottleneck won’t secondary effects (due delayed surgery/treatments). 

Texas’s approach correct one Texas. 

I don’t think ethical considerations (pictured link) nearly significant cdc let be. you’d rather give dose 20 year old grocery worker long-term facility people? support American citizen much expensive third worlder level testing homeless populations realistic attainable goal? need ramp testing much US. yup, that's it. It’s sad think much could prevented certain political party believed science. Take millions solve prob USA. meant understanding teaching goes. Much job training comes medical field, that's myths persist still passed down. Also help teaching hospitals abundance iv drug users/homelessness population serve. perpetuates bias. 

I know program clear pain treating real matter internal bias tell you. started working hospital see everywhere.

People pain never hospital labeled drug seeking. Like yeah educate pain free unrealistic (aka like right surgery), make realistic goals like let's able sleep comfortably. get control.

Not say ppl drug seek pain, tell me, something give/stable vitals, problem. not, time page doctor ask planet thought 650mg Tylenol going enough.

I've spent many night paging docs pain meds fine make floor. excruciating pain hit can't anymore nice pacu meds one things ordered already gave it. NHS say look for: high temperature, new, continuous cough loss change sense smell taste. 
The symptoms watch new - that's asked question. I've booked test sure either way Small, homogeneous populations culture freedom pathetic comparison multicultural, multiethnic, country almost 400 million culture bucking government authority. 

It's amusing examples authoritarianism go to, though. telling well. day two inquiry, three-way call CHAMPVA UCLA credentialing office. 

I knew would protocols terminology would go head. CHAMPVA lady explaining getting pushback showed - would easy. 

We’re upfront private practice offices comes CHAMPVA, we’ve experienced unwilling billing departments - completely understand. reimburse rates Medicare.

Key Points

Question hospital outcomes patients coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) improving?

&amp;#x200B;

Findings cohort study 38 517 adults admitted COVID-19 955 US hospitals, rates 30-day mortality referral hospice varied 9.06% 15.65% best- worst-performing quintiles. early months pandemic, 94% hospitals subset 398 improved least 25%, strongest determinant improvements hospital-level outcome decline community rates infection.

&amp;#x200B;

Meaning else equal, COVID-19 mortality hospitals seems lower prevalence COVID-19 surrounding communities lower.

&amp;#x200B;

Abstract

Importance unknown much mortality patients coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) depends hospital cares them, whether COVID-19 hospital mortality rates improving.

&amp;#x200B;

Objective identify variation COVID-19 mortality rates rates changed first months pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

Design, Setting, Participants cohort study assessed 38 517 adults admitted COVID-19 955 US hospitals January 1, 2020, June 30, 2020, subset 27 801 adults (72.2%) admitted 398 hospitals treated least 10 patients COVID-19 2 periods (January 1 April 30, 2020, May 1 June 30, 2020).

&amp;#x200B;

Exposures Hospital characteristics, including size, number intensive care unit beds, academic profit status, hospital setting, regional characteristics, including COVID-19 case burden.

&amp;#x200B;

Main Outcomes Measures primary outcome hospital’s risk-standardized event rate (RSER) 30-day in-hospital mortality referral hospice adjusted patient-level characteristics, including demographic data, comorbidities, community nursing facility admission source, time since January 1, 2020. examined whether hospital characteristics associated RSERs change time.

&amp;#x200B;

Results mean (SD) age among participants (18 888 men \[49.0%\]) 70.2 (15.5) years. mean (SD) hospital-level RSER 955 hospitals 11.8% (2.5%). mean RSER worst-performing quintile hospitals 15.65% compared 9.06% best-performing quintile (absolute difference, 6.59 percentage points; 95% CI, 6.38%-6.80%; P &lt; .001). Mean RSERs 1 398 hospitals improved; 376 (94%) improved least 25%. overall mean (SD) RSER declined 16.6% (4.0%) 9.3% (2.1%). absolute difference rates mortality referral hospice worst- best-performing quintiles hospitals decreased 10.54 percentage points (95% CI, 10.03%-11.05%; P &lt; .001) 5.59 percentage points (95% CI, 5.33%-5.86%; P &lt; .001). Higher county-level COVID-19 case rates associated worse RSERs, case rate declines associated improvement RSERs.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusions Relevance first months pandemic, COVID-19 mortality rates cohort US hospitals declined. Hospitals better prevalence COVID-19 surrounding communities lower. Interesting 7 day moving average cases appears peaked last couple days. Hopefully real effect upcoming holiday. Unfortunately know till week 1/4 probably. Please remember Mike Pence said 'The Democrats Progressives want make rich people poorer poor people comfortable.' 

Remember McConnell wanted give $600. 

Remember put multiple billions maintaining dominance across globe can't, read won't, shit people. 

Instead using giving us back money choice give taxes, give away Rich foreign powers. I'm 'America first' type sweet fucking hell, need help people worrying everybody else! lose/lose either way. avoid limit narcotics, making experience pain. give narcotics, oversedating. Tolerable amount pain far better oversedation F#$%, January going start really bad phase pandemic... friends selling hobby belongings distressing hear imagined would be. want friends troubles like this. kind country anymore. shitty sequel, don’t like [**COVID-19 Resource Points**

**Question** projected clinical outcomes costs associated strategies reducing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections among people experiencing sheltered homelessness?

**Findings** decision analytic model, daily symptom screening polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing individuals positive symptom screening paired nonhospital care site management people mild moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated substantial decrease infections lowered costs 4 months compared intervention across wide range epidemic scenarios. surging epidemic, adding periodic universal PCR testing symptom screening nonhospital care site management associated improved clinical outcomes modestly increased costs.

**Meaning** study, daily symptom screening PCR testing individuals positive symptom screening use alternative care sites COVID-19 management among individuals experiencing sheltered homelessness associated substantially reduced new cases costs compared strategies.

**Abstract**

**Importance** Approximately 356 000 people stay homeless shelters nightly United States. high risk contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

**Objective** assess estimated clinical outcomes, costs, cost-effectiveness associated strategies COVID-19 management among adults experiencing sheltered homelessness.

**Design, Setting, Participants** decision analytic model used simulated cohort 2258 adults residing homeless shelters Boston, Massachusetts. Cohort characteristics costs adapted Boston Health Care Homeless Program. Disease progression, transmission, outcomes data taken published literature national databases. Surging, growing, slowing epidemics (effective reproduction numbers \[Re\], 2.6, 1.3, 0.9, respectively) examined. Costs health care sector perspective, time horizon 4 months, April August 2020.

**Exposures** Daily symptom screening polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing individuals positive symptom screening results, universal PCR testing every 2 weeks, hospital-based COVID-19 care, alternative care sites (ACSs) mild moderate COVID-19, temporary housing compared intervention.

**Main Outcomes Measures** Cumulative infections hospital-days, costs health care sector (US dollars), cost-effectiveness, incremental cost per case COVID-19 prevented.

**Results** simulated population 2258 sheltered homeless adults mean (SD) age 42.6 (9.04) years. Compared intervention, daily symptom screening ACSs pending tests confirmed COVID-19 mild moderate disease associated 37% fewer infections (1954 vs 1239) 46% lower costs ($6.10 million vs $3.27 million) 2.6, 75% fewer infections (538 vs 137) 72% lower costs ($1.46 million vs $0.41 million) 1.3, 51% fewer infections (174 vs 85) 51% lower costs ($0.54 million vs $0.26 million) 0.9. Adding PCR testing every 2 weeks associated decrease infections; incremental cost per case prevented $1000 2.6, $27 000 1.3, $71 000 0.9. Temporary housing PCR every 2 weeks effective substantially expensive options. Compared intervention, temporary housing PCR every 2 weeks associated 81% fewer infections (376) 542% higher costs ($39.12 million) 2.6, 82% fewer infections (95) 2568% higher costs ($38.97 million) 1.3, 59% fewer infections (71) 7114% higher costs ($38.94 million) 0.9. Results sensitive cost sensitivity PCR ACS efficacy preventing transmission.

**Conclusions Relevance** modeling study simulated adults living homeless shelters, daily symptom screening ACSs associated fewer severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections decreased costs compared intervention. modeled surging epidemic, adding universal PCR testing every 2 weeks associated decrease SARS-CoV-2 infections modest incremental cost considered future surges. So? money either goes government people mostly need it. already know US government giving peanuts citizens. Giving charity seems like logical alternative considering Congress Senate right help Americans pandemic.

Additionally, people say worth 400 million dollars. idea much liquid. assume millionaires money lying around bank rather locked contracts, assets not.... fuck threshold y'all start think cares?

What charities???? look one nitpicking microscopic observation Beyonce rant sake nothing? USA ranks 120th quality food globally.

ONE HUNDRED TWENTIETH.

You seriously ignorant think food eating high quality healthy.

It's cheap.

That's it. Thats complete nonsense. White people enemy. black Americans twice poverty rate whites, still twice many white people poverty line. problem economics lack access adequate healthcare. None new except maybe skipping meals? Meaning loss appetite? Goes along nausea. new either. Damn. people sleep A&amp;P? nerve endings. That's fun. seem suggest black, none story gives evidence that. always wonder people try frame experiences light racial differences. experience reddit shit could anyone, fact uniquely American.

It appears also many people say racism reason injustice happens them, time ignore many injustices happen races too. saying believe shit happened color skin, provide zero evidence it. 2 weeks till full zombie outbreak happens. Good know economic benefits vacine mean investment asset pays need intense public service education viruses. yet another reason people believe spreading virus, care spreading causing harm understand. 

Slow spread, slow mutation. Frankly could less annual flu spread well, virus education could improve health overall. Headache, Fatigue, Diarrhoea, Muscle pain, Skipping meals, Confusion  absolute numbers they're actually sequencing lot. Concluding Paragraph: 

As number SARS-CoV-2 infections continue increase across country vaccine development continues rapid pace, critical ensure populations highest risk left behind. study Edlow et adds important information understanding vertical transmission raises concerns lack impact vaccine given women pregnancy might protecting neonates. appears that, like influenza, COVID-19 severe pregnant may associated preterm findings underscore importance ensuring pregnant women included SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinical trials opportunity receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccines found safe effective. also highlights importance protecting pregnant women newborns exposure SARS-CoV-2 infection. learned much transmission SARS-CoV-2 since emergence approximately 1 year ago; essential lessons learned used protect pregnant women newborns. Removing imperative go work

The Capitalists want America Capitalist. people wake fundamentally abusive system puts capital humans is, never change. new...? Sorry, come again?

First off, fucking awful metric choose. represents economic strength country, quality groceries.

Second, adjust per capita took values? compared 330m population population 60m.

AND THIRD, YOURE EVEN RIGHT????

France most, ITALY.

Hahaha hahaha

Never ever seen blatant American ego horribly wrong.

**Main Outcomes Measures** main outcomes SARS-CoV-2 viral load maternal plasma respiratory fluids umbilical cord plasma, quantification anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies maternal cord plasma, presence SARS-CoV-2 RNA placenta.

**Results** Among 127 pregnant women enrolled, 64 RT-PCR results positive SARS-CoV-2 (mean \[SD\] age, 31.6 \[5.6\] years) 63 RT-PCR results negative SARS-CoV-2 (mean \[SD\] age, 33.9 \[5.4\] years) provided samples analysis. women SARS-CoV-2 infection, 23 (36%) asymptomatic, 22 (34%) mild disease, 7 (11%) moderate disease, 10 (16%) severe disease, 2 (3%) critical disease. viral load analyses among 107 women, detectable viremia maternal cord blood evidence vertical transmission. Among 77 neonates tested SARS-CoV-2 antibodies quantified cord blood, 1 detectable immunoglobuilin nucleocapsid. Among 88 placentas tested, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected any. antibody analyses among 37 women SARS-CoV-2 infection, anti–receptor binding domain immunoglobin G detected 24 women (65%) anti-nucleocapsid detected 26 women (70%). Mother-to-neonate transfer anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies significantly lower transfer anti-influenza hemagglutinin antibodies (mean \[SD\] cord-to-maternal ratio: anti–receptor binding domain immunoglobin G, 0.72 \[0.57\]; anti-nucleocapsid, 0.74 \[0.44\]; anti-influenza, 1.44 \[0.80\]; *P* &lt; .001). Nonoverlapping placental expression SARS-CoV-2 receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 transmembrane serine protease 2 noted.

**Conclusions Relevance** cohort study, evidence placental infection definitive vertical transmission SARS-CoV-2. Transplacental transfer anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies inefficient. Lack viremia reduced coexpression colocalization placental angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 transmembrane serine protease 2 may serve protective mechanisms vertical transmission.

Let's take iphone. Without research physics, computing, etc done universities last century would iphone. Yet would say Apple stole public researchers work stole profits, iphone actually result university researchers 60s, would you? No. Apple developed iphone. used public knowledge so, public made iphone. made plans assemble parts, developed software, set production chains, on.

Merry Christmas you, hope enjoy it. agree. Seems like reinfection taboo shouldn’t surprising never concrete evidence can’t happen. it’s likely happen, 1/100 get infected, even there’s immunity(unlikely using extreme case example), happen twice would 1/10000. Here’s speculation though, it’s less likely (1/200 1/300), cases less severe, level sterilizing immunity. I’m healthcare worker slated vaccinated Monday! Proud among first Americans hopefully put end pandemic. Twitter epidemiologists evidence overwhelmingly points reinfections 1) rare 2) resulting mild cases (immunity isn’t all-or-nothing, immunity virus, still get infected, less severe case otherwise would). experts don’t seem concerned large antigenic drift UK South Africa variants, I’m either. Thank you. agree everything said, except fact half-ass measures took back March April actually slow spread virus. Otherwise, May June would like like right now, overwhelmed hospital rising deaths.

But yes, never stopped half-assed measures. whole-assed lockdown individual support payments brought NZ levels. data collected decade ago, kids born 80s become Attending Physicians yet. Racial discrimination less prevalent younger docs (just observation), becoming charge things. irony calling commenter arrogant ignorant hypocritical hilarious. I'm Canadian. pretentious. time worker customer satisfaction factors making profit. market mechanism broken due poor controls basics - corporate transparency accountability, anti-monopoly laws financial regulations.

Markets function well fraud, manipulation abuse rooted out. Consumers workers can't alone. Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine much easier roll quickly cheaper, advantages it. also seems almost universally prevent serious Covid infection, really need. final data Oxford vaccine published soon. advised people medical conditions take vaccine. Old people medical conditions usually come hand hand You’re right, everyone’s 20...fuck off. Well lucky then. lot people easily dir it. wife one them. Stay safe. offense taken all. LMAO. Still clutching straws. Sweden highest proportion single person households world. Let's even get started population density. Let's even get started supposed advantage number doctors medical facilities.

But sure, keep making excuses. two variants together, UK South Africa one. already UK variant, could stop SA dominant strain best move, many direct flights flights SA makes scale UK.  saw yesterday too. heartbreaking watch speak. wanted someone rescue her. Today going around telling everyone know watch tape. don’t know done one medical care persons lose license practice. UK three months. global already. elderly, high risk father law guilt trips us going see Orange County 🙄 I'm suggesting currently waring mask anything conscientious. saying benefits could become new normal.

I'm UK, celebrated everyone wanting them. non compliance like places. Japan one country masks already become new normal winter, though know people feel them.

However, perception population mood, people think different. closest think vaccines. sceptical country France 33% disagreeing vaccines safe (18% disagree effective), yet 97% children get them. UK US fall 95% target mostly 90%, despite media screaming many sceptics.

Culture change. companies start seeing financial benefits reduced sickness mandate, schools would also place improve uptake, adaptation rise. 

It needing 100% people people, proportion people protecting others would huge gain, also winter lot colds, flu virus illness increases (according company data anyway), would also see larger benefits.

""The right show face"", vs protecting people ill future (talking flu, colds, etc), weird stance me. Wow, beats nursing homes I'm little surprised. dream disturbingly often. think returning normal going take quite while. less medical texts old white guys still nearly every leadership role. think AZ even going submit FDA unlikely get approved due study. Also, vaccine 67% effective, compared 94-95% effective vaccine moderna pfizer. good team doesn’t give fuck anymore us wear masks would wear regardless president says.

But president puts foot hard, dumb-dumbs gonna resist means people public wearing masks. seems lots evidence reinfections perhaps antigenic drift. dont think woods. state's hospitalizations reached levels seen since mid-May, all-volunteer crew Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps say they're getting handful COVID-19-related calls week. Back spring, ambulance corps slammed twice usual call volume — almost every single one COVID-19-related patients respiratory distress, cardiac arrest already dead definitely patients we've transported tested positive around someone positive,"" said Chief Jacob Finklestein, 25. ""But we're definitely seeing type grave medical conditions seeing March April part."" Anything ordinary folks help front?  say one person builds basement. said millions people make individual parts basement get checked.

The machines complex, made simple parts. Dont Pfizer vaccines need administered twice? First shot, 2 weeks later booster shot? took religion equation. Incorrect Black people DEFINITELY getting worst go off. 

I would imagine Black folks face linguistic discrimination, since speak English well White folks. Darker skin Latinos Asians face racial aspects, also get discriminated language accent. Fix Black people EVERYONE else gets better care.

I would imagine reducing healthcare racism Latinos, example, also result better care EVERYONE. 

So instead making Black issue, make POC issue. way, get allies. better? title little misleading yes? lot governments (and government research money) involved creation vaccines? feel like bloomberg might showing bias here.  also mentioned making vaccines problem with...its rest horrible things do. end day really capitalism health care make horrible mix. Lockdowns enormous boon tech companies large retailers afford harsh capacity limits.

The stock market well *because of* restrictions, spite them.

If one conspiratorial think might intentional. agree. send money Israel, Pakistan etc without means care people. get affairs order, send money everyone else. course, decades following fat tyrant. get deserves soon Biden-Harris administration. US privilege taking 94% effective Moderna 95% effective Pfizer.

What countries questionable poor-efficiency vaccines like Astrazeneca (could anywhere 62-90%) Sinovac (could low 50% depending final results)? better hold better one? strongarm doctors. many times doctors disagree, either try inferior treatment first 4-6 weeks patient pays thousands dollars pocket insurance pay it. Fomite transmission assumes respiratory link. two cases would need place different times person link eachother. Looks like got open presents early year! US luxury taking 94% effective Moderna 95% effective Pfizer.

What countries poor vaccines like Astrazeneca (could anywhere 62-90%) Sinovac (could low 50%?)? better hold better one? taking person mad fitness, takes supplements shit, eats insane diet supposed healthy.

But still willing goes gym, wearing mask, braving public transport, exercise height pandemic...

No, wasn't. average 200 new cases per day ""practically eradicated"".

Even France, one worst hit countries Europe seeing around 4 times many cases per day population 6 times large. kinda true though. lot countries tout case numbers testing far be. know much helped though. nothing compare to.

It’s silly think herd immunity point summer goal. think summer start bars parties full swing, idc elements normal really actual demonstrated behavior people mass scale past 9 months.

Which mix “take precautions cases surging, relax they’re down” “lol big deal fuck lockdowns masks.” Very, people diligently take precautions even cases deaths low, Fauci suggesting people do. Yes. Hi, Mr. Nefarious here, source anxiety. quote actual article:

I really can't find information all, know Reddit may answer, really know go get one? call CDC? local Pharmacy? go getting vaccine available him? Would anyone know? also seems almost universally prevent serious Covid infection, really need. 

How completely inconsistent idea even mild covid infection lead serious long-term effects, myocarditis, etc.?

It seems I, healthy lower-30s man, gone year+ effort get sick *in part avoid risk complications myself*, want wait vaccine 94%+ effective preventing even mild covid, given vaccine exists. Business elites collective never convinced behave like Angels give profits working class.

Researchers Brazil, also running final Phase III trial vaccine, said Wednesday shot 50% effective, withheld full results company’s request, raising questions transparency.

Turkish researchers said Thursday major side-effects seen trial, apart one person allergic reaction.

The Turkish trial began Sept. 14, researchers said 1,322 people taken part.

Sinovac first Chinese vaccine maker release details late-stage clinical trials, following positive results rival products developed Pfizer, Moderna AstraZeneca last month.

The Turkish researchers, speaking alongside Health Minister Fahrettin Koca, said 26 29 people infected trial given placebos, adding trial would continue 40 people become infected.

“We certain vaccine effective safe (to use) Turkish people,” Koca said, adding Ankara would use data licensing vaccine.

Turkey agreed buy 50 million doses Sinovac’s shot receive delivery Dec. 11 shipment delayed.

Koca said **doses would arrive Monday**, adding Turkey would vaccinate nine million people first group, starting health workers.

Sinovac also inked supply deals vaccine, called CoronaVac, countries including Indonesia, Brazil, Chile Singapore, negotiating Philippines Malaysia.

Koca also said Turkey would sign agreement Pfizer partner BioNTech 4.5 million doses vaccine delivered end March, option buy 30 million doses later.

US national program, leaving individual hospitals universities wonder know. test can't know one way other. think somewhat misleading; distribution numbers date, I've read administration numbers 3 day lag. That's going make look like state agencies bottleneck, even aren't. 1/3rd 1% down, ~99.7% go.

Feels weird, simultaneously depressing hopeful time. one hand we're making progress, hand realizing little kind crushing.

I'm trying depressed vaccination numbers start somewhere started.

Maybe we'll semi-normal lives around 2022? miss... um, everything really. Social interaction, restaurants, lack existential fear around people, etc... find reporting available capacity still severity general population. reporting used 95% available beds. lol cannot serious. Yes days increases might product college students flying home. would call man running 180 million dollar bio lab we’re building “smart” I’m glad say 80% people know work happily declining vaccine New strains announced almost often ""Record high daily new cases"" now. mean ""stack boomers save life""

Medical triage. ""Rationing care"" means letting folks die folks higher probability survival therefore get scarce care. science people could trust. It’s bad isn’t research finds way slow spread Covid. /s Let’s also cancel student debt. took debt I’m victim Yes that's works. look value perspective. grad student know hundreds fantastic ideas/concepts, especially biomed. can't even count amount times told sentence ""if xxx ie developed might revolutionize medicine"" end presentation new biomedical approach. 

But stage, say prof team found new concept published couple papers it, stage lot value. hundreds ideas one knows whether actually work practice, developing mature product takes decades billions, really risky. That's get sold much less end product might get. first spinoff company risky investment capital develops further, thereby walking steps development path. successful, shows product worth beginning, fail yet proof might actually work. bigger company buy it.

I’m definitely waiting data. Especially people start getting second dose. issue amount vaccines, need ""tents"" lol Op, gonna need new name weeks... pessimist 2021? that's true, Ebola also ultimately got control people West Africa willing change took care dying people conducted funerals. Also people present day literally never dealt pandemic lot aren’t going gyms avoid Covid. Give people break Every week feel grumpy annoyed. wanna workout interact people real life again... I'm fucking pissed every day. There's even sun outside cheer up, sea cold swim in. agree that, hence I’m still going get vaccine unless doctor tells to. 

But get anaphylactic shock, dangerous people covid itself. Bloomberg gonna Bloomberg “smart people” know.

Seemed pretty obvious talking Science- “the systematic study structure behaviour physical natural world observation experiment.”

That done outdoor dining thus assumptions science. done hand stove, thus science. reason people freaking mutations (well were, think they’re mostly now) early pandemic told virus proofreading gene basically doesn’t mutate.

Am one remembers this?

If implied covid could mutate downvoted like 2-3 people reply “proofreading gene covid doesn’t mutate.” (And people would get like 10+ upvotes.

I can’t one remember this. weeks ago, “fact” covid doesn’t mutate. mean ""stack boomers save life"" certainly work. Genetics 101. Fruit flies that. Should?!? Really, try little tolerance ... little.    
🎅 Santa knows who's naughty know lot people including smart people getting vaccine calling stupid? vaccinating President say go away itself. hope Biden sensible enough put place keeps moving 2022 beyond. really wanted give Fauci benefit doubt I’m mad actually moving goalposts instead honest upfront. would better mental health sake take bad news pill beginning rather led trail lies. basically non-scientists trying sell news general public based politics. ever seen study eliminate confounding factors really see masks can't do? add confounding factors see changes?  


This nordic Countries masks-everytime hype train well: know masks enough, spread bad information need make masks political issue. Go norwegian website read say masks, message pretty clear: ""we know exactly much masks work, we've seen masks + social distancing work social distancing works masks. Use masks packed room, indoor, touch risk person, feel safe wear them, still need rest masks alone enough, overkill alone street outside"".  


On contrary Countries masks became political like Spain, Italy work became political opposite policy like parts US social distancing work. dare say anything like here?? Don’t know USA MUCH MORER! Source 7% seroconverting? 

So you’re counting people who’ve tested positive twice 90 days? 

Is likely turn mostly people immunocompromised, extremely young, things think taking account reinfection possibility average person? 

Alright, I’m open understanding number number 3.5x higher number wide taken seriousness. I’m agreeing you, right amount people severe reactions 8/1,000,000, .000008%. Exponentially lower Covid mortality Vaccines apprently start slowly Latin America, Mexico starting 3000, Chile 10000, Costa Rica around (the three Pfizer vaccines) Argentina around 30000 Sputnik vaccine.

The rate increase slowly, least help health professionals protected month now. military protect nation? could planned advance. beyond incompetence. right. ER copay $750 deductible $5000. take high risk job factory job get sick, likely wages cover cost treatment getting sick said job. Why? 20mil end December always optimistic, vaccination process going get better get doses open vaccination centres. 20mil vulnerable UK protected, I'm sure it'd US, we're hoping vulnerable protected March, we're using Oxford considerably less effective Moderna. think America great position come April. hope anyway. kind thinking ""99.99999996% survival rate people"".
Like, yeah, maybe die 7 day stay hospital able work month? (Happened somebody know ""survived"" it) bullet kidding. psychiatrist stressed many patients..... People youth middle adulthood legitimately likely die flu. claim bankruptcy it, yes option, definitely last resort. So, either take control finances work payoff debt, keep sitting around waiting government rescue (they won't). downvote want end day kidding think government coming save day. won't, still sitting debt plus interest. That's problem right there. healthcare workers could together put aside pride start striking; would see change pretty fast. People ignore hear news different story grandma needs help. believe responsibility demanding better working condition lies workers, regardless circumstances. clue. can't remember hearing either way COVID-recovered people virus transmission, know they're recommended wear masks public (which said doing). got wondering can't verify getting vaccinated means can't transmit virus. Someone might know sure, like Google, guess. eats bananas gets grocery section forbade enforcement mask mandates

Pandemic fatigue? Sure. Rough time? Sure. 

It's sudden trauma. Lmao. Sorry bro. I’m used seeing /s didn’t realize😂  Yes, approved started vaccinations earlier US. considering US already 10 million doses ready vaccination point, don’t see behind rest world vaccinations initial argument stated. 

So, tell countries getting vaccinated US waiting. 

Tell false accusation Trump bought 20 million doses where, reality, secured 1 billion doses multiple different manufacturers. 

Tell people could getting vaccine US right main issue production vaccine rather sort missed order Trump. want go “once get vaccinated” route wait 2 weeks second shot since that’s immunity peaks. definitely makes much worse. hell letting people without wearing mask? Complete madness. use March 16 'before start' pandemic, clearly incorrect. 

Either use legitimate benchmark date look 2019 Christmas travel see year year difference pandemic year non-pamdemic year US. hate “fearmongering” here? spend much whining? Seems like really afraid something. What? unbelievable many downvotes has. sub fucking hysterical... ""vaccinate slower, america rulez!11!!"".

All said absolute need reserve second dose storage could handled future supply chain. get benefit people getting first dose earlier, despite whatever keep trying claim. enough immunity likely reduce number infections, number severe infections, overall spread. good done giving reserved doses letting future supply handle second dose, obvious trade risk supply chain gets disrupted.

But people safe hospitalization deaths go down, care less asymptomatic spread.

40k deaths 0 Covid deaths masks distancing everywhere. Ikr... I've got friends telling business usual.

I see articles wonder.

I've local hospitals recently frequently they've never close capacity covid. odd.

Eyes ears telling one thing, articles telling sky falling. gotta figure stop people getting multiple vaccines money wasting precious vaccine stocks posting people strongly suspect we're vastly overassigning blame credit human choices actions opposed innate nature virus natural conditions. trajectory virus seems quite similar across states countries regardless actions policies taken. remember coworkers going India beginning March reported flight home 30% full.  America! Lol hear you. better worse I’m months away even option vaccinated.

I feel frontline workers “up” allergy issues giving pause. 

Here’s thing - it’s mental too. assume someone can’t mentally put anaphylactic shock (placebo effect real though anything possible suppose) could definitely see panic attacks. Fauci's new estimate 90% hit herd immunity obviously absurd... North Dakota approaching little 50% infected ton people live paycheck paycheck too

That's true probably hardest hit economically, still awful lot people live paycheck paycheck choose spend everything luxuries. patients develop detectable IgG antibodies, detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies, suggesting immunity.

Thankfully you’ve given reason believe almost everyone gets virus survives able develop antibodies. Certainly 93%. Brazil’s government doesn’t seem care Concerts tickets impossible get. imagine good festivals be!  isolation, quarantine. keep saying “stay home holidays, able”. leaves loophole people. Unless it’s literal medical emergency, people stay home. Except kid little enough understand parents gone, probably affect while. 

When youngest little, ended hospital pneumonia. still one parent home, gone days traumatic enough took weeks would stop clinging came home. Toddlers still fuzzy concept ""parents always come back.""  Dan Forest ReopenNC nutters support type superspreader crusade renegade churches. folks denied healthcare hospital support. Let Jesus heal homes. POTUS really powerful man earth can't even enforce mask mandate ""It's states"" legally enforceable federal level?  good know likely would need small study ensure safety effectiveness new version oppose variants news yet documented. 

bad news still would take time produce new vax needed quantitates. Still better go back beginning many months trials month development time. article new mutation identified UK, UK sequencing positive tests look new mutations anywhere else, variant probably everywhere. Especially USA stopped flights UK. 

Oh, explains everything. know area, probably surprised.

I hope none come Asheville recently. amazing... year tough! weekend place husband works outbreak least 70 percent workers home sick getting tested nearly tested positive. super worried also got tested. Fortunately tested negative, quite unfortunate since qualify covid payments. husband can't go work wait told safe again. Ugh. family going struggling work situation sucks... hope everyone everyone works makes okay full recovery. going office every day almost every day...does office protocols put place? coming full time since June &amp; last Friday office ordered pizza lunch &amp; 13-14 people ate lunch conference room 22-23 total people office &amp; 1 conference room tested positive knocked whole staff week. 7-8 people daily office eating lunch together conference room. Surprisingly, 6-7 came back negative far. protocol place allowing anyone eat conference room breakroom.  wear masks distance end time? majority vaccinated? 

I'm fine latter, end going former - obey. I've obedient entire time, I'm vaccinated people are, yet STILL demand - disobey.

This way life sustainable.

We need get rid masks social distancing ASAP - even means still lose 40k people/year COVID.

But I've vaccinated (and I'm going among last I'm young healthy), wear mask certainly social distance.

I care thousand per year die COVID. Death part life.

We can't protect everybody.

Most people think vote politicians keep pushing mandates COVID exists.

Picture this. November 2022. vaccinated past 15 months.

Nobody know died COVID past year.

Yet, still testing everybody. 

They still publish COVID numbers daily.

And states - hundreds new cases daily hospitalizations deaths.

It's worse flu point.

With predictable results. And? result hospitalizations? really matter? Generally, viruses become contagious, become less deadly. Though always true. But, basic reason virus spreads easier becomes less deadly symptom stage gets faster people less likely spread (i.e. sick bed).

In summary, mask wearing enforced places transmission likely. say open air public areas, mask wearing observed, yet closed settings, not. Masks distributed used insufficient prevent spread virus. Mask wearing nurses insufficient prevent spread prolonged exposure patients.

Eh plan get everyone vaccine June now, inevitably delays Kindof? companies developed vaccine 2 days. Government paid buy vaccines Yah no, that’s actually works. check before, 15 minutes start, transfusion.

I’ve never seen transfusion reaction 11 years nursing, give transfusion week easily. risk extremely low advancements blood bank protocols.

And units American acute care hospital 8 9 patients, besides maybe discharge lounge people waiting ride home. one units exist, patient requiring blood transfusion would transferred higher level care. Unless work garbage hospital also exceedingly rare hospitals part nationwide organization chain. Children children. adults making choice. make choices. even get one? Facebook blown people showing vaccine cards...Like work healthcare employer silent it. ultimately means little bad California doing. California sitting 800 tests per 100,000 people making testing double states higher end states. And, positivity rate much lower many states. Yes struggling still much better situation many places.  Let’s see trump fuck Children can't get vaccinated, anybody kids would still inclined take precautions. That's 33million households.

Also, vaccine 100% effective, given choice establishment requires vaccines one would personally choose safer location. reduce chances getting sick, also reduce encounters crazy anti-vaxxers. knows diseases could carrying? Same! I’m super excited I’m going feel huge sense relief get shot. really can’t wait strongest thrived survived. lot people forget chronic poverty, homelessness, prison. people recover childhood trauma. survivorship bias.

To give anyone else priority pandemic wrong. sounds quite alarming:

Clinicians providing anecdotal evidence shift clinical epidemiological picture- particular noting seeing larger proportion younger patients co-morbidities presenting critical illness. #SARSCOV2MediaBriefing  I've studied lot stats never heard naive regression.

Idk countries willing let people fly different countries this. live California suffer consequences others. Thanks UK! time make sure new UK strain virus gets spread around country. Surely people covid yet least get priority, though? Trump going learn say South Africa annoying, racist way blaming country strain. litigious US is, I'm surprised heard anyone companies sued sort negligence. didn't. Crime scene.  get heebie-jeebies another way - hard year. said anything random people. nursing programs LA pumping nurses like nothing. Might good tome rethink given emergency. Good thing fairly asymptomatic also got aware it. getting severe case probably strep decade ago deal fun IV antibiotic, someone near got felt fatigued day later got appointment quite quickly even though major symptoms tested positive. catch something like early stages take blessing. hopefully Covid, even beyond vaccines, antivirals become available get people get infected reaching point needing supplementary oxygen outright hospitalization.. Incorrect, Pfizer shopping based ordered first ordered back June would ahead several countries. Instead decided nickel dime vaccines, moving us back line. Since logistics shaping mean even people want going hard time getting it, seems like marketing primary challenge moment. Anti-vaxxers bring everytime. Canada 2.7x less deaths per capita US.

Stop dumb fear mongering. Canada done better US. America failure. Let’s rephrase this. 

We fix this. It’s profitable we’ll sacrifice workers call heroes hope nobody notices. problem: people saying can't get reinfected, mistakes people reinfected really reinfected. basically saying can't get COVID twice year two.  

We good numbers reinfection rates yet, even evidence rare.   

Thousands people telling others masks help all. hundreds people trying tell others reinfection happen. things dangerous misinformation.   

And yes, course, people could mistakenly think COVID twice. Yes, please give portion directly Current CDC guidelines says need watch patiens 15 min (30 min previous allergy history) make sure dont get anaphylactic shock would suck, far know 6 cases 270k vaccinations. block virus. block respiratory droplets virus traveling. Cases gone 30% since thanksgiving, deaths nearly doubled. case count probably artificially low due lack testing. near 100% increase deaths weeks I'd call ""a negligible impact"". That's right language use.

It's due Thanksgiving though.

If look case counts state state basis (see much clear. Cases gone since Thanksgiving nationally, that's largely highly populated states (California, Texas, Florida, etc.) seen significant increases. look case trajectories, increase faster Thanksgiving. slight dip cases due people getting tested holiday weekend states have, able tell holiday fell based increase - true nationally - dip around holiday, trajectory looks same.

In states number cases decreasing - Illinois, Dakotas, Colorado, etc., etc., holiday cause number cases increase. peaked around week Thanksgiving continued fall despite holiday. saw slight increase (Indiana, etc.), they've resumed downward trajectory.

Either way, think there's way person actually looked data conclude Thanksgiving led increase cases. timeline moved back Or, words - Sweden counts differently.

Not difference counting, difference testing absolute numbers, per capita.

A majority cases Sweden found Stockholm region March April. region 1.7 times many inhabitants yet Tegnell well aware country rapid reaction capabilities. job demand capabilities. Instead waxed lyrical...

This valid criticism. argue Swedish FHM failed mission identifying lack tools handle pandemic. Fear outrage!! Go go action media! (Reuters) - Travellers wanting fly Netherlands required tested negative COVID-19 three days departure next Tuesday, Dutch government said Wednesday. Passenger flights countries temporarily banned earlier week discovery virulent new variant virus. government said would look broadening order train, bus boat travellers Netherlands, coronavirus infections jumped around 40% last week amid new lockdown schools many stores closed. Netflix Party awesome idea!!! look that. Thank you!!!! agree two weeks long time could less mean two weeks nothing start vaccinations Europe goes faster places. We'll see months vaccinations managed Europe. also depends Oxford-AZ vaccine J&amp;J, two vaccines may give big advantage Europe. vaccinate like 100-200 million people within span 3 months every year, new flu vaccine. said, COVID actually mutates slowly virus, amount cases drops vaccinations mutations take lot longer virus isn’t given many opportunities change objection wto wearing mask improves health reduces sickness?

It's normal (or me) ... yet. lot Asian countries traditionally worn masks.

In terms benefits, say personally; sniffles, illnesses year feeling good that, number others. think combination, masks, hand washing, home working office martyrs coming (I fool, even though get 6 months full sick pay).

More impactful company sickness rates. dropped floor (we furlough anyone remote working strict rules). used averaged 8 days year sick per employee (this includes long term sick), bit lower industry average. 

Now 1 day sick per employee. Double still gain £200k extra staff productivity (it's ignored holidays average 38 days gave everyone extra holidays year partly low sick rates).

So workplace going keep number measures benefits. Hand washing gel continue, hint sickness mean working home feel fit enough. currently split departments 1/2 home 1/2 office work likely stay increased cleaning levels.

Masks also potential keep public places, something I'll probably push board us supply (2.5% savings improved sickness spent). Yes things go wrong that's redundancies built logistics plans.

I'm saying rollout disaster, yet. ambitious starting target they'll need hit target increase rollout 40 percent every single month get everyone vaccinated September.

It's huge undertaking.  surfaces people touch, watching people touch face. NTY. Proper sanitary practices Wuhan, China, would saved 1700000 lives pziler vacine likely could transported lower temps, want risk study 1,00,000 million vaccinations clock, hopefully, going report every single rare case something happening simple shot? find Billy G's vax-chip runs Windows 98 tried make thru actual study - skim ctrl F while, long, full statements disputing findings inconclusive biased, nowhere comes conclusion title, best states ""statistically negligable contribution"". Good. need Americans literally give fuck them. Apparently trial run 2 year old toddlers. point shouldn’t lenient leaders. We’ve letting get away long this. UK notoriously reopened economy little effort trying contain virus. someone like California suffer consequences someone else coming UK bring new mutation. Sure, behind countries mere days. Approvals (from countries waited proper trials) still fresh and, logistically, production delivery still ramping up.

Canada also ordered doses per capita country, opting hedge bets vaccines may pass fail trials (and might pass trials.) answers done.

Because Nationalist Defense Production Act never activated force production PPE? never attempt federal leadership coordinate rollout efforts federal, state, local authorities, private corporations, non-profits?

Because beginning this, *someone* central leadership told states get PPE own, sent FEMA officials steal supplies states stockpiled own? lack central leadership coordination caused country fight fighting virus? 

I mean, know better, I'd almost say looks like narcissist anti-social personality disorder give shit anyone running everything!

South Africa's testing / million population, although highest Africa far, still waaaaay UK. really know SA less raw number. could also struck lightning simotaniously mean China built hospitals 10 days beginning. infrastructure done done matter weeks government invokes wartime production acts. yea staff shortage main issue help seems like general public give shit affects suddenly 'Where doctor's nurses!?' 'Why hospital full!?' everyone's like there's enough exacerbating problem. common folk Remember sub used downvote people -1000 suggesting reinfection possible actually know happen, ultra-rare?

I think I'm going draw big list completely wrong predictions subreddit had. first virus would become pandemic would contained Wuhan, second there'd wave winter we'd hit 'herd immunity' last spring. Yeah, needlessly scaring pets traumatized loud noises something could definitely lose. Funny many people ones often shout loudest honoring troops first responders. Science vital existence. know it. creators vaccines heroes book. Political power I’m guessing? Moving fundamental religion? Conservative voting? possibly take peoples time energy real problems?

Making world less functional benefit someone. Old people die. 80% deaths 65 plenty things happy about. can't help already see that. Vaccines actually work better vaccine dose provide exposure fewer side effects. Tetanus noteworthy example this. Natural immunity unlikely second lowest LD50 toxin. lethal dose far low immune response. could lot immune already gotten covid want doses go someone might need more. hope HHS convinces get vaccine.

I also hope there's enough delay jump ahead line. ask center, I'm currently enrolled CureVac vaccine trial said could get vaccine another manufacturer whenever ready. compete what's already here. That's part every doomsday scenario leaves out.  really? thats surprising looked health canada said side effects hope made sure effects approving need vaccinate at-risk solve lot death rate. People still die hope see death rates plummet month two. 1.yes should. People undermining virus long. It’s shit show way leaders undermining virus. want strains come out, undermine possibility new variant virus coming later sooner? words ignore future. We’ve downplaying virus there’s repercussions people needlessly spreading causing mutations spread more. 

2. think should, we’re finding varieties way virus impact someone’s body. IE people losing teeth. 

If pressing issues putting pressure leaders we’re better literally ignoring pure greed(IE USA). United sucks sure Vaccinating small percentage population limited social contacts (people 70/80) little curb spread. drastically reduce fatalities. taking advantage Pareto distribution :) family mingle since March. know strong anymore.

Stay safe stranger. literally held press conference apologize badly fucked last week.  love this! [all homies 🙌💉 would lock 5 years make example him. Another year? keep moving goal posts away. feels like experts don’t really think life go back normal again. 

One thing sure, Covid never going away. never get everyone take vaccine. vaccine effective, doesn’t everyone vaccinated?


Just think seeing end pandemic, got new mutation worry new restrictions. 

They gonna hold restrictions us long see fit reason. Life know won’t going back normal. upset vaccinations I'm wondering certain states seem much slower vaccinating people others. -\_- I'm looking you, NJ. can't believe people complaining there's vaccine (because they're psychotic anti-vaxxers), are. People complain. let math. 1 million people vaccinated, 9 million doses held reserve. holding back enough redose everyone 9 times? Egg, could planned eventuality much better.

Instead, millions doses sat warehouse days logistics plans shit. Good
Only 374M people left go! get downvoted. Studying Comparative Literature college upside. 

Cheers! J&amp;J wont even finished data end january likely wont March get approval.

And downers realistic. realistically people wont get vaccines April May. around 45 straight weeks daily corona cases getting worse week (last week I’m pretty sure hit 700K daily several days row) might finally start see drop weeks. 

I wish worldometer would add vaccinated column  white guy Question: I've seen friends say followed precautions, still caught covid. couple friends say caught boyfriend careful family member came see even though they'd exposed (and tell friend saying goodbye). question is, caught virus even cautious diligent stay home/wear masks much possible, think got sick? Nope. US genomics biotech powerhouse. basically invented next gen sequencing - Illumina, PacBio American companies. invented PCR. actually completely ridiculous centralized place funded this. gangly consortium likely even good access patient samples. I'm sure tons researchers want get hands it.

Denmark (lived several years) medical research powerhouse thanks state centralization medical data patient records. general done Europe. US still stone age aspect things. Pfizer started 12-15 year old testing October finish March April. Presumably early results great start testing next age bracket earlier March. Since disease almost impact really young kids doubt need test anyone 7 8. Neighbor across street rental party company setting tomorrow night. 1000, technically. None permanent residents, quite folks hang months work. takes 10 days one million ten percent USA one year. Takes ten years get everyone. It’s Pfizer vaccine inserts say unknown effect fertility. We're already organizing workplace mandatory vaccine. like vaccines, trust I'm stoked polio ""x"" company telling us put bodies is...well trust government types fucking capitalists best interests heart. want profit control. Vaccinating elderly cut deaths 80%. almost becomes flu like point. long known temperature within normal range often cuts viability viruses (and things). Basically factor 2 every 10 degrees C. Obviously also sharp knees curve phase catalytic transition 2 every 10C good rule thumb proven otherwise. 


However, significance fomite spread begin with? Outside frozen packaging, handling could resuspend freeze-dried droplet nuclei settled, fomite spread big deal? required provide link source research paper. hate popscience websites don’t that. hard embed direct link? legitimate medical reasons get vaccinated. one those, proper medical certification (that one reasons), doctors recommendation....  

But, exception, think might headed. Goodness, yes right, plethora global articles starting panic me. contagious strain people notified, it'll still likely protected some/all existing vaccines. contribute society lot ways. don’t work biotech doesn’t mean can’t opinion topic directly affects me. didn’t say stimulus said stimulus. current one won’t last. gets muddy though. There’s many variables liking. thing every article regarding outdoor transmission, conclusive way trace infection back outdoor settings. guess work. I’m wondering useful mask really open air. Thanks!

First all, can't ""make"" someone take obviously. people want it, good chunk may never get employment requires late next fall. 

They still going get healthcare whether get get ""pushed back phase 3 line"". ""withholding"" anything. get vaccine. 

Then discussion moves last paragraph. beneficial give people go someone home 24/7. really can't make call. 65-70 mean ""at home time"". people worked 40+ years hit retirement want finally fun go experience life. helped economy decades diapers. 

Now realize may privileged balancing life way working lots fun personal life age 65 lots people 65+ minorities worked whole life never got fun. right enjoy retirements cross 70 quality life decrease significantly(since minorities tend worse health age). thinking people. 

Of course agree vaccines first go people risk groups frontline workers. Yes. Exactlu, believe. doesn’t make true.

The point vaccinating old people reduce death rate 80%. moment Estonia better, Latvia equal (less positive cases, deaths), Balkan countries worse Sweden. likely cause differences? Vitamin levels. 
 
Cumulatively Sweden still worse Baltic countries, better 5 Balkan countries. trade mine $20 gift card? 

I’d rather get beef jerky. East LA way underrated. I’m East LA lived Santa Monica/West LA six years college grad school.

There lot high income neighborhoods East LA. unlike people West LA/Santa Monica/Beverly Hills flaunt wealth expensive cars, clothing Michelin restaurants, wealthy people East LA tend low key. going need mandated. know several people going claim sort religious exemption. Paul, you? Paul Alexander? met one time, conference last year. really long talk trick people forced herd immunity pretending kids unharmed, brilliant plan. It’s me, Ron. remember me? information going annual vaccination COVID-19? ""get 2 shots done"" vaccine? everything early tell still? Many state/national plans considering putting potential nexus individuals higher priority: already medical professionals top, putting first responders next, talk/action towards putting people like teachers cases grocery workers earlier queue. I’ll take chances not-florida. Welcome country imperialism. 

Plenty money bomb innocent civilians overseas, enough help people though. Military actually delivering. Unless they've changed/added companies McKesson w/ UPS &amp; FedEx shipping.

Though feel talking code, helped understand strains mean bit more. Thank you! Yes, title read ""1 million US citizens halfway done getting vaccinated"" #2 like make sure playgrounds safe kids play even they're clumsy, can't let made child like decisions die. takes discipline. Something people have. think ""We want bare cost vaccinations"". would think admin's intentional spreading virus, would lot mutations would found. We're one big petri dish, coast coast. They’re going needlessly spread kids well, don’t tend suffer much still pretty bad cases, we’re still learning long term affects. talking another subreddit old roommate got covid, never got tested symptoms days, last months gallivanting around multiple states. Someone tried challenge saying would’ve contagious two weeks, it’s nothing good wasn’t big deal. 

2 weeks contagious. Going two different states going breweries restaurants there. going almost cross country wedding. insane amount people infect. Marco That's good news. Maybe another yet approved vaccine work kids. know vaccine candidates developed tested. I'm hopefully swing towards wanting vaccines happen quickly there's civil unrest get it.

This issue US vacccines going arriving faster put arms. going many citizens affluent countries, used getting way, waiting long time this. NCBI dozen deposited sequences N501Y Victoria, Australia June-July. check mutations yet, someone should... guy work covid full 14 days. Ever since he's back, he's coughing regularity. one worried one infected him. Lingering nuisance coughs common covid flu well. vigilant symptoms cough alone good reason afraid. Lmao glad enjoyed hometown. bad I’ve already lost 3 family members covid glad got walk street fill tourist shit matters dude really connection NZ citizen. lives Taiwan. ultra rare makes mad! father law assisted living year now. They’ve able keep virus recently ONE staff member extended family Thanksgiving...tested positive asymptomatic course spread it. 20 60 residents hospitalized including father law, others sick. count fear porn profanity yes. There’s reason believe it’s safe. Yeah, know. Hence question. life votes blue important one votes red? Backs wall? epidemiologists do. back wall dog's throw ball. puzzle needed solved quickly possible, least two vaccines approved finished got first case US. scientists developed vaccine idea government would let spread, much less actively work spread disease widely possible. could never imagined catastrophic whole thing was. 

This puzzle first solve it, best solution, one solutions saved lives career-makers. exactly do, we're lucky them.

Imagine threw money curing diseases currently spent developing expensive drugs treat symptoms... 21-28 days first Forced closure “non-essential retail stores” government mandate absolutely goes idea individuals peacefully assembling purpose exchanging goods services.

Who gets decide difference essential non-essential goods services? That’s obvious power-grab scam move completely speaks itself.

I understand public, basic reasoning suddenly become super confusing, whole authoritarian overreach thing conveniently disguised underneath heaping pile cheesy rhetoric state “experts” know best, cos really really care us, people ought unthinkingly concede state demands let governing class decide members public allowed assemble purpose conducting business, because.

This part con ought extremely obvious anybody two brain cells rub together, mega-behemoth retail conglomerates like Walmart open biz bar corner apartment remains closed government order, there’s justifiable, scientific basis one other, state said so, simply unscientific fuck logically morally unjustifiable.

Of course right assemble isn’t absolute, I’m claiming gang thirsty dudes absolute right assemble ladies changing room Victoria’s Secret dicks hands, freedom.

The state actively normalizing use violence intimidation peaceful business owners haven’t committed *real* crime simply disobeying demands so-called authorities.

State intimidation business owners solid reason obvious infringement right assembly, justification provided argument authority.

Doesn’t logical inconsistency seem slightly suspicious you? Exactly, countries seemingly getting free pass insane. Every single comment making sub focused Sweden. 10 frequent posters commenters thing. those, maybe 1 2 *max*, actually living Sweden. simply find peculiar user activity regards country.

Wouldn't deem strange? words, problem needs solving around 200 million people vaccinated. going provide articles countries amusement make another denial point. never said anything losing sense smell. That's basically cons. I'd terrified eating something spoiled ending food poisoning know taste all. N501Y also D614G. Technically N501Y D614G replace D614G. thanks president trump! /s took one Economy! Better win gipper. think original r/coronavirus contain profanity? 😂 Regardless, UV D-vitamin factors. Omg, saw EMT performed cpr, explicitly says didn’t give mouth mouth.  safe use protection! It’s like 20% think. 1 billion poor people tests beginning. rural town America right now. Walmart, store, restaurant, etc. employees want wear masks bother enforce it. fear retaliation. know supposed hold second dose. downer rate take 10x years get Americans vaccinated.

1M / 10 = 100,000 per day.
350M / 100,000 = 3500 days ~ 10 years.

I realize we're ramping we're going get 10-20x better. Note sequencing variants way conclusively prove reinfections (each infection different versions virus show remnants first infection). Yes might never pass 90% considering death rate decrease exponentially risky population vaccined. become flu less risky flu people care much Yes, agree this, also assuming 9 million doses available. 9 million doses today, 9 million 21 days now, means immunized 9 million people 63 days, instead inoculated 9 million 42 days. believe anything worry about, people take it, wait weeks opinions take become much prevalent.

And probably flip, weeks people start complaining yet gotten it! polar bears wearing masks. Yes above, except travel within borders states believe. Depending country you’re in. whether vaccine-requirements actually implemented another matter entirely, legally possible. Loved Gatlinburg last week! Great city, guys rock. know works? I'm genuinely curious, got vaccine (have get another 21 days). know done research so... need list. list use search persons name. feel like card faked 1st dose gives significant benefits. 95%, somewhere 50 I'm sure extending previous lockdowns would prevented countless lives well. I. Like. Cuomo. Good! would get vaccine disease aint got???? /s 339,000,000 go ""You would expect temperature makes huge difference, that's saw. point packaging virus completely destroyed even moderate temperature increases,"" said Michael Vershinin, assistant professor University Utah co-senior author paper

Did miss link actual research paper? article say much anything really. get Moderna vaccine Monday! Throw buffet I’m in. D. North American. It’s read disinformation English Americans.

É. parents give chicken pox vaccinated?

F. mods actively censoring topic reinfection sub? That’s really sus. Thanks! Lots great details document. agree seems like N501Y case advantageous convergent evolution. also find interesting sheer number mutations UK strain — conditional origins mutation burst surely focus research. Congrats!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* quite frankly understand subcontract vaccine distribution CVS, Amazon, Walmart private companies decades experience logistics vaccine distribution. Look - joke - I've reading Dostoevsky's *The Idiot* past months, eloquence subject feels like right monologue Prince Myshkin General Epanchin family gathering dacha mid-June. 

I appreciate thoroughness (also Dostoevskian trait) sentiment. hopeful, given happening, - noted elsewhere comments - US long way go. Thanks, best you. lol would donate countries? He’s covid. doesn’t really need vaccine. impactful repercussions taking Covid vaccine? companies make proof vaccination requirement hire someone? schools deny enrollment unvaccinated kids? travel? countries require proof vaccination travel there? Genuinely curious aspect. IMO repercussions better. fact tho

Whatever don’t talk bigots many side effects? best think answer question. 1/20th amount supposed have. behind, amazing.

At best leaving politicians military avoid backlash. worst, truly behind. Really? vaccinating US citizens? None yet no. Emergency service personnel Good luck family, hope stay well. think underestimate professionalism Truck Drivers. know people kept us eating buying worthless crap online. *biontech person injections person watching check anaphylactic shock. could couple EMTs watch dozens patients time nurses inject 2-3 people per minute each. Well 

a) check history. Im Canadian. first language french speak four languages. would like privately prove set head straight

b) Reinfection real rare documented scientific journals including international scientific journals

c) much ignorant science think are. brought single citation would take defeat argument Nobody gonna say anything. rule ""mandatory, enforced"", assume are.

Honestly, people wear masks poorly piss lot people wearing masks. already on, give fuck makes breath warm fogs glasses.

And think cuts air supply, need go back school think masks capable meaningfully filtering oxygen molecules. ""Meatpackers""

""...and meat coming""

Hahaha Good question, good answer though. Thank much.  hear vaccine best option us Canadians. requires less extreme containment methods easier deploy ...did watch video, though? link people watch wasting time pointless reply covered video. That’s good, I’m glad live country government admits mistakes instead arresting doctors journalists covering problem. Let’s go Florida. People run vaccinations taking days off. little holiday would literally kill someone do.  Exactly. aren’t ready administer administer use want it. got work every day dozens people don’t get ppe hospitals get course is! There's much paperwork involved every single level. God forbid someone gets vaccine without signing 50 forms first. Always! Masks, social distance hand washing. first think anything it, couple days ago thought maybe should? dunno, reflect care take going out; remind think SOPs bit more. case necessary vaccinate entire population reach herd immunity. need 70% population get COVID-19 vaccine establish herd immunity. Belgian population currently 11,460,000. 70% 8,022,000. people vaccinated stop spreading it? protect them? fan. too!! medical people know vaccinated scheduled waves, people bad reactions whole hospital doesn’t call sick day. 

My nurse friend said half co-workers sick come work day shot. wasn’t able lift arm little fever 24 hours — young, healthy, thin, active RN. wear mask outside high risk people life fact city pretty dense nasty, curious conclusive data common outdoor transmission really is? I’m hard time finding anything conclusive. Likewise dude. ✌ Well dont know would expect every person getting paper details inyection, person kind problem Id imagine would make sure safe you.

But lets assume first case like possibilitty went undetected trials.... make headline ""Person suffering __________ gets allergic reaction"", headline makes seem like random Alabama guy got it, considering started, could really mislead people. (I saw somewhere today 4 10 americans dont trust vaccine, thats alarming).

Dont underestimate power misleading headlines. antivaxxer fuel. old, work health care. idea 700 million doses wouldn’t we’re now. Warp speed already vaccinated million people it’s growing exponentially every day Got first dose today. sure expect regarding side effects going since flu shot normally run moderate fever feel like crap day starting eight hours later. I'm ten hours since COVID vaccine feel absolutely normal. nurse talking said ~3,000 people inoculated havent even seen rash yet. Overall seems thoroughly tested vaccine. Heres hoping proves effective long term! Please send Tennessee we’re cesspool covid. people keep visiting acting like happy came. Ugh. Again, pull wool eyes. People like banned subreddit telling people Asia reinfected back March, next day America “discovered” reinfection real. wrong then, you’re wrong now.

Why? Honestly think it’s language know read English.

The problem won’t believe anything real someone prove already happened. always side incaution, ridiculous. I've WFH 5 years. Fiancee (as yesterday!) WFH last 8-99 months.

I love it. lived together last two years everything great. Granted, share dishes cat litter, make ways.

I'm pumped get along well feel like 2020 proven it. Thank you, stranger internet - really appreciate :) Back you. 3 Options:

* Either current vaccine effective it

* requiring updated vaccine

* current vaccine makes symptoms much less sever get new corona Yeah, would require touching nasty asses though. sat far away possibly could them. luckily called name quickly, room longer minutes. pisses off. feel like one nurses staff nicely said something though. idea, one friends works calls job could easily done home months, made come back getting tested co worker came positive interacted everyone :/ thank 🙏🏻 hope start feel better soon Different everyone depends health/age/etc.

Drink plenty water/electrolytes. Stay away much added sugar. 

Eat healthy. ordered vegan ramen bunch virus.

Supplement vitamin d/c, zinc, magnesium, fish oil, quercetin, melatonin. Here’s links:

Vitamin regimen starts page 7 go walks mask feel like it. Get sun. Stay internet think positive. Anxiety real especially it.

Sleep well, eat well, hydrate well good. Good luck! friends: wife got vaccine
One stupider ones believes things like chem trails gop: hope doesnt faint


Followed thinking what? would faint? would side effect. Looking find brand new story somehow already heard showing girl said faints stubs toe. definitely people cannot afford take time sick. However, also jerks selfish. coworker comes work sick time. workgroup, also someone MS another kidney transplant. immunosuppressants. give two craps getting sick. selfish. 2 pills day! getting supply idea? look Bloomberg tracker, states aren’t even close expending current supply. 10%. That’s issue. It’s efficiency distribution problem, based see. oh gosh im sorry hear that...I hope don’t face something like continue recover...

Interesting mention itchiness...Ive super itchy night try sleep.... probably know yet. may reduce efficacity, nullify vaccine entirely nothing. We'll know handle thing next Fall/Winter comes lockdowns shit go crazy. 

Either way, numbers go weather starts getting warmer people get vaccinated next winter true test.

Of course, point, I'm sure reached social end pandemic...I'm pretty sure Spring, lot people stop caring, whether that's good idea not.   Thanks hard work Dr. Fauci totally right. adjustment many, many people going easy. fact diminish hopefulness growing advent vaccine, would cruel wrong glass-half-full view ignore toll taken pandemic itself, -- live countries like US -- super-concentrated doses anxiety wrought massive campaigns denial, full awareness planning playbook pandemic scenario literally tossed trash bin country's leadership. stain reconciled one way another. 

You mention effects people like -- great sympathy hope near future enables re-connection restoration trust. May patience understanding process. group difficulty reconciling kindness -- denialists, especially top. Senators Representatives strove suppress acknowledgement, stood way science financial assistance -- early access vaccine bugs shit me. Sure -- science clear, folks vaccinated, better we'll be. consequence repulsive contribution mess -- hyper-excessive deaths, economic destruction individual lives, everyone essential put delays diminishment status safety.

And protested masks vehemence violence claims name freedom -- go hell. vaccinated? course -- right thing good all. made life worse? 

There consequences knowingly adding misery anxiety death bankruptcy public safety. consequences be, be, truly idea. 

So push anger side now, choose instead tell anyone situation sun also rises. then. Stay safe. Stay sane. Stay gold. Nice try plague inc I'm glad going numbers still good. I'm content fact family able access risk consent see me. probably basically immediate family year, I've seeing whole time.

Everyone's gonna different though. saying unfortunately maybe personally think way all. I'd probably what's best mental health (weighing nice see vs. fear/anxiety). Ooo wait tomorrow. Hurts good. doctor friend Canada working virus told this, addition last comment here: “sigh...

""Government officials get priority, people need more!!""

We can't both. least way nutjobs can't another reason dismiss virus. Zone’s hundreds residents packed together - often wearing masks, many living sleeping bags tarp. Without running water plumbing, simple pandemic health protocols, like handwashing, difficult. Although city posted portable toilets washing stations along perimeter, feces garbage litter property. spots, stench overwhelming.

This sound like POW camp. Wtf Americans doing, unhygienic conditions continue fuelling pandemic. Live posted. Ask variant everything else. noun

I stand previous fact based opinion. Feel free provide evidence change mind. existing evidence strong. Yes. According Anthony Fauci, World Health Organization, German Health Ministry, vaccines cover VUI 2020/01 strain SARS-COV-2, virus causes COVID-19.

One employees turned away needed hospitalization due possible blood clot covid. Shes early 40s, admit bc theres room. week ago.. fingers crossed sakes. Look there! Good point. real goal post see death rates plummet irrespective many vaccinated mean, vaccinations many states even started people long term care facilities, PA wont starting plan Monday, point CVS, Wallgreens, etc giving vaccines lot faster Hospitals can. No, Finnish Norwegian, Danish Estonian newspapers. depends quickly authorize vaccine use children. parent I’m getting vaccine it’s available me, kid can’t age guarantee I’m traveling, going high risk business/activity I’m going use services company requires everyone vaccinated option.

No, I'm not. I'm responding specific comment.

You're imagining shit. Lay crack pipe. comment direct result people’s selfish behavior seen personally. “I want cannot adjust life all.” Absolutely safety precautions taken refuse believe necessary. Complaining families 364 days year, throw hissy fit can’t go see them. sure pissed much. course, relatives upset. 

I really upset relatives visiting Thanksgiving.

Dad 73 62 y/o immunocompromised wife. 

All avoid worst plague living memory go inside anywhere place. id love see detailed explanations specifically vaccine works, might happen vaccine exposed coronaviruses, protein response could change immune function long run talked mainstream media. currently seems like trying talk children simply saying ""its safe""...personally, im inclined believe safe, people skeptical, seems like depth discussion potential long term effects pharmacology vaccine general would helpful, even alot goes people's heads. 

the ""dont worry guys, safe"" messaging media discussion vaccines pharmacology potential long term effects discussed clear, objective, technical detailed way seems counterproductive far getting people skeptical take vaccine. live States, opinion matter, think great. like service recognized.

I'm reminded Heinlein's saying Starship Troopers, ""Service Guarantees Citizenship"". wonderful news. We’ll free curse.  Yet USA, Europe Brazil people African descent hit extremely hard.

The points valid. Yeah Biden really done PPE last March election! get point, Republicans literally say things like straight face infuriates me. [10 days since estimated would 7-day average 2850-3000 deaths/day referenced (actually 12/22 updated yet today) 7-day average 2780, 70 deaths/day *bottom* range, though suspect discrepancy may due delay death certificate records processing increased workload. estimated 3000 deaths June --- notice claimed would post-Thanksgiving surge *most* (NOT ALL!) places, yet still managed slightly *over*-estimate deaths would reported today.

17 days ago posted [no-post-Thanksgiving-surge case maximum peak estimate 250K weeks following 27 days (~4 weeks) since Thanksgiving. 7-day nationwide case average currently falling peak value 223,866 --- 26,134 *below* 17-day ""no-Thanksgiving-surge"" maximum-peak prediction.  (Really 30-day prediction referenced post, posted 17 days ago, I'm gonna claim 30 days.)

You swore would much worse predicting. hope accept math human behavior *is* critical part predicting case-load jump conclusions future. Yup. clue get it. People work dropping like flies lately pushes back deadlines. Ah, fair enough. suppose it’s better cautiously plan things not. Seems simple rare see reddit, particularly COVID19. 

aka swedish problem gona open bat pangolin petting zoo. agree you. fact don’t think we’re disagreeing much. wanted point 99.97% stuff misleading. Fauci one originally gave timeline. Stop pessimist. Things gradually going keep getting better that's damn good thing. life died Covid. Hockey 3 weeks! leave million belgium guys, 10mil Sure people Reddit say either haven’t gathered all, wearing masks whatnot, Reddit represents small fraction society. 

Not that, say gather friends wear mask comment gets heavily downvoted possibly deleted. people Reddit simply show posts comments. 2021* typo end Vaccines save lives vaccination little percentage basis far. dare happy country’s COVID success! offends beliefs...../s 2020, ""fat shaming"" cool. think probably realistic RE: phase 1, count hospitals, medical centers nursing homes distribute vaccine. 

Things pick distribution moves away moves local governments comes vaccinating public. Well vaccine won’t prevent catching Covid. milder symptoms catch it. 

I think look anything might help stop transmission help treat Covid even vaccine. People still getting sick dying. astonishing...

Finally good news use words ""covid"", ""good"" ""USA"" single sentence. matter say. people fucking selfish ignorant. stupid good word too. see christmas loved ones. think eastern christmas next year. try ask children wanna celebrate grand parents get presents one last time skip one couple Events celebrate them. say let's go choose right way skip christmas. little kids much smarter parents. Kind funny somehow strange right? South Africa. detected cos lots sequencing. variant already world. makes sense block flights SA UK. /////Sss   Sounds like broken system I’m saying doubling well underway pre-Thanksgiving. fact, rate increase deaths slowed since holiday. I’m hard time understanding think Thanksgiving caused numbers already control beforehand. “Rising” lol. Look actual number cases. long diligent quarantine infected situation still much control. “Some restrictions” LATE 2022? Holy bejeezus. wild. comment would've downvoted oblivion month two ago Yep! Christmas back on!!!!

I exceedingly careful months order spread thing Dad &amp; family. 

Well, infectious ones Thanksgiving, refused go visit (of course know yet). 

They survived, safe. 

It's gonna hard say ""I told so"" 1000 times though. don’t think anything comment disagreed said. Damn. Instead ""begging"", hospitals coldly announce age BMI people turned away without seen.

Maybe change behavior. 0 studies long term side effetcs

On bright side anything happens you, cant hold anyone liable except 😂 Got link vaccine tracker? Sports definitely back normal long protect players. stadiums open air, already safer. enclosed stadiums might limit capacity little while, doubt last long. think biggest risk players keep spreading around, assume spring summer able get vaccine I'm gonna call bullshit

Thing is, US anti-shame culture. can't embarrass people changing behavior here. work aids, certainly going work Covid. Protect family first, don’t worry people getting getting vaccine. control that. get sick, it. That’s them. That’s sad, I’m sorry. area three conventions planned May August timeline, one scifi, one furry one anime con pretty much already cancelled 2021, others around time frame ""watching things closely expectations cancel"" others late 2021 predicted hold events maybe restrictions Earlier month exposed COVID. 2 friends got super sick tested positive. called HR said probably exposed COVID, went got test. stay home get results? HR says “ long feel fine symptom free report work normal.” did. 4 days later positive result came in. got lucky wear masks/distance work one working super close ended testing positive getting sick, I’m sure situations like mine happening around US well. know inaccurate test 1 2 days exposure? family exposed together weekend. Many tested Monday , negative positive. However read many places tests less accurate uncommon get false negative unless wait 5-7 days exposure tested. articles vague - “it’s less accurate”. Okay well mean? There’s 1 100 chance it’s false negative? 1 10? 1 2? Natural herd immunity back table! /s Feeling good. Arm sore 2 hours. Otherwise nothing far. Let’s fucking gooooooo striking (not working) helping patients? Ummm yea makes sense /s I'm threatening ban making joke. I'm telling banned making fun others stirring drama.

As final point, would direct towards Rule 1, subsection 7. kidding. got sentenced prison, death camps. obligation get inmates killed. couple possibilities reality probably combination them. 

1. Africa young population overall younger people tend less severe cases. 

2. Researchers found evidence higher percentage Neanderthal DNA link severe cases. DNA found people African ancestry. 

3. Lack testing lead deaths caused covid reported resulting misleading statistics. 

4. People spend time outside western countries it’s harder virus spread conditions. i'm sure group volunteers lead kushner dank room mean click HQC top page 210 studies it. fraudulent? ones found effective? like live little orlando bubble, people neighborhood overall amazing wearing masks. mean. Yeah. Bars open. part little weird is. 

It’s interesting see communities take seriously others. community 30 min away house supposedly horrible acting like nothing going on. Weird times. 50% final number. It’s threshold considering vaccine effective. announced merely vaccine effective. final result could well much higher 50%. recent approval emergency use vaccine UAE, efficacy cited 86%. delaying announcement efficacy number trial work one number across multiple trials.

The big advantage inactivated virus vaccine supposed much cheaper easier transport, show 80+% efficacy, would huge developing world cannot afford $20 per dose Pfizer vaccine. understand doubling deaths means? I've already used plain English. There's massive upwards curve. Back line stuff comes courtesy Conservative Party Postmedia conservative leaning outlet. faults, Trudeau done fabulous job promising delivering. remember shitty 2012 movie? scene main character asked cheap laborers got room ark laughed at? enough old folks unaware social democracies, regulating capitalism anyone gets healthcare education...

Got it. seems something wrong that. would imply immunity, obviously would statistically off. portion needs information. truth nobody sure. UK Health secretary said today he's ""hopeful"" 2022 gave promise. replies come people constantly unrealistically optimistic wrong every single one predictions far. Yes. Two hundred million doses total. Two doses full vaccination. One hundred million full vaccinations. like AZ

You quite clearly know nothing vaccines. 

You keep posting this, make true  even comprehend post? fucking gym economy??? 5 million people New Zealand lost 2 months life dumb government. can't even put price something like that. internet toxic story going pick hoodies one wanted available online. Nothing needing paycheck. Oh haha. Amazing mention likely already may already type protection People still catching Covid even wearing masks social distancing. keep reading people preventative measures still got Covid. Israel goes last dash hope thing already Europe lol You’d surprised much comes FB. 😂 millions doses already made would trash would need start again

Why would trash? there’s new strain doesn’t mean old strain isn’t still circulating. It’s possible you’d need still distribute current vaccine another one, assuming neither vaccine worked strains.

Regardless think it’s highly unlikely vaccine doesn’t cover new strain, experts vaccine makers don’t think it’s going problem. copy human dosing using horse variety. cheap scale give correct mass paste use. dressed up. Nowhere go. There’s videos going around saying shot spring it’s like you’re actually getting 330 million people hard number comprehend... Damn, must really big brain. feeling first dose? I’ve hitting local rural Texas Walmart random maskers weekly months yet somehow I’m still testing negative. hate position defend Walmart, maybe church problem equation? Yeah worried know portion kids severe symptoms long ""sick"". affects heart cardiovascular system. family heart problems already see fight school sending back vaccinated. kids teens worried especially one already got health problems. claimed obtained, anyone could obtain 3m verifiable masks 100.

If said ""anyone obtain chinese made n95 niosh masks 20"" wouldnt responding back forth.

Your comment equally applicable. medical respirators cannot used medical settings.

It's ok wrong. you, would accept move on. Excellent news considering vaccine effective one doesn’t require ultra cold storage. situation, would leave job. Doctors nurses obligation help anybody else shouldn’t make less money hospital administrator wanted money invest stocks. lot nurses doctors strike fault lies solely people hospitals profit healthcare system. word “hero” doesn’t mean jacks hit unless you’re financially compensated like hero people power. double blinded peer reviewed scientific studies supporting safety efficacy vaccines. Supporting suspicions nothing general governmental distrust complete lack evidence. Skepticism generally good, admit scientific evidence would convince unless supported viewpoint. 

You're skeptic, simply another conspiracy theorist thinking ignorance equal science. ""high risk"" people people hospital dying. everyone gets mild case recovers quickly. way. daughter age. Plus helping horses. say want evidence say accept anything scientists.

Nobody responsible ignorance, responsible getting change.

You go elsewhere wanting excuse debate right wing conspiracies. doubt anybody interested bad faith arguments nobody. Case numbers always undercount though? Thanksgiving doesn’t change that. Go check curve trajectory holiday tell “huge surge”. dunno older family members. like think road full highway men something. used think family members like wife's family way.

Lord forbid drive night rain. That's certain death.

Personally right I'd hitch hike across country flying. Oh he'll get next week. think probably middle ground: instead reserving 1-for-1, reserve lower rate, say 1-for-5, gets doses sooner leaves enough doses reserve account supply chain disruption (which presume trying guard against). read it. Nothing say Warp Speed helped them.

And know quote 😘😘 every country deaths? They’re getting prosecuted too? understand freedom money though. agree logic #3. already happening. England tier 4, aka lockdown remember guy! hard core denial. get bad case, though. Mexico buy this, sux! anybody know there's plan buy (later, course 🙂) Pfizer Moderna vaccines? reports hvac systems helping spread virus. winter furnace running, hot air hurt virus goes room room hvac system? talking lockdowns either, I'm sure point trying make think *some* business incentives. 

1) company want trained employees come COVID take sick leave. That's expensive. 2) company want gain reputation risky environment patrons / patron's children.

It depends business, obviously, certainly incentive require it, employees customers.

It's similar mandatory masks businesses now. Businesses incentivised keep employees - certain extent, customers - healthy. * People United States, mean.

This isn’t citizenship don’t think there’s different dying hospice 95 throwing 50th story burning building? That’s unusual difficult do. need virtually zero special equipment blood transfusion. think bigger risk 26 year old man concerned spreading covid parents. best Christmas gift! God bless. Lying title. amn't doctor point talking me. shoot messenger haha.

I 100% sure vaccines fight versions current COVID19. Why? lots top doctors said so(and said without shred doubt). specifically said get resistance vaccine takes years-- reasoning.

Again, messenger. many nurses available? Theyre little tied already... Yeah 556k people vaccinated Friday. That’s exactly said. already reached 1 mil. quick exponential growth like saying. Wow o_o there’s base vaccine, easy tweak adapt potential future vaccine breaking mutations? still need whole trial process lengthy wait periods? hilarious? can't find larger collection idiots side YouTube comments Also get second dose late it’s probably still highly effective. don’t data, like 1 week sway second dose end world. I’m still camp reserving second doses though due we’ve seen supply disruption Americans understand logic understand money. Doom gloom gets much attention. Given current spread, unless households isolating two weeks beforehand, there's way least one person bring covid Christmas. Sir know exactly vaccine 

Landstar entered chat somehow triple brokering load everyone lost macro'd hamstrung Madigan machine. Even wanted something, there’s way he’d able to. Madigan dying best thing happen state years. Idk, I’m RN covid unit I’ve best year ever financially. top that, covid patients 100x easier care typical cardiac cripples. know nurses country. don’t think many us “struggling” outside major cities like LA NYC. beauty nursing don’t like are, apply new job hired within week. don’t like heat, get kitchen. It’s story year. Sweden invoke martial law war serious threat war. way declaring state emergency peacetime, least without changing constitution (which would possible 2022 case).

The government completely tied legislation, create new laws shut parts society extent. Look temporary law Spring example, new coming pandemic law. government power would country attacked Russia. Yes, are. doses, people prioritized. ramp fairly quickly. I’d also note current vaccine tracker likely lags actual vaccines pretty significantly. ""Can stop mutating...FOR FIVE MINUTES?"" I'm sure kind administration buy plague medicine pandemic outbreak said plague???

Even pfizer, company who's business model hold insulin ransom thought slimy negotiate plague medicine. Pfizer took high ground. oh serious side effects? Friday 560k Week day learn read god dammit. reached 1mil... SLOW. expected pace said already NEAR month.  likely would've blown lot earlier then. US pretty safe European countries already bad among 27,480 people HIV (0.16% study population) higher general population adjusted hazard ratio 2.59 (95% CI 1.74–3.84; p&lt;0.0001).  believe strain 23 mutations genome.

Don’t think might 1mil vaccines /10 days upcoming months? ""But they'll fake get work"" /S

Seriously, people choose personal financial stability infecting others, we'd much better right now.

For reason, ""calling sick"" seen weak work ethic. contrary, pandemic taught us anything, ""calling sick"" genuinely believe infected makes good worker. infections spread workplace decreases productivity weakens consumer confidence. Customers going return see whole staff coughing storm. like guns. mean yes something concerned panic about. say vaccines work mutated strains unless learn otherwise panic. America beautiful. 0.3 % population. Keep going! Yah they’d go business. Florida cancelled electives month operating normally now. electives cancelled, laying people expected huge hospital surges covid never happened. (And still haven’t happened yet). fuck ways can't even imagine possible

*SWIFT entered chat* you’re Republican yes. 9 million time. year, flying least half dozen times year work. much miss it, flying anytime soon safe so. need millions die change. havent enough deaths people even think real yet.

Of two part followup, Part 1 2 seems better written. talks search existing approved drugs determine efficacy. realistically. whole direction problem changed release vaccines problems created B.1.1.1.7 variations. moms nurse 25 years prestigious American hospital. She’s overworked overtime right annoyed isn’t paid extra disagrees general sentiment stuff

Doctors/nurses educated understanding jobs. get paid well great benefits. upset grocery workers nurses would thought thing protects humans reinfection protecting humans reinfection. older people? Same, rewrite mine less political. Tho probably anyway since issue certain party party, party whole. blame this, blame administration, one seems enough. Truly best christmas present dreams time. They're pretty awful. also fairly focused dreams - is, start unpack logic within. outdoors? people tested? going see parents tomorrow? Etc. 

I also - sure this, lot friends - watch TV I'm watching narrative program see people gathered together indoor space without masks, get little anxious. ""Do realize they're wearing masks??"" really dumb enough believe continue cautious kids get vaccinated? die except rare situations. article says 10 days would equate 100,000 day. continued pace would closer 5 years. They've months plan this, would expect faster roll out. supply issue 10 million doses available. 99.7% go! work hospital received shipments vaccine week ago. boss contacted asked wanted get scheduled date me. vast majority people absolutely fucking hate China hate Chinese people, ccp. There’s whole shit ton travel contract nurses though. amount money pay, never shortage staff. SHIT. 

Here go again. Basically certain part certain party hijacked understanding use advantage. actually snap fingers nurses appear. It’s called travel contract nursing. pay us one week would typically make month.

Hospitals don’t want bottom line. rubber meets road hospital needs staff, it. plenty nurses line contracts. coulda killed hallway nurses station know. you. Texas? 'probably better waiting'

That's rub though it? There's virtually part pandemic that's benefitted ""let's wait see"" style approach. Oxford/AZ approved month, millions doses available immunise vulnerable now. UK 700+ people die today. one else waiting around vaccine even completed testing case. 

Even months J&amp;J finished approved, still production bottlenecks mean theoretically inferior options reached for. Perfect allowed enemy good. long truly important people got first. /s RemindMe! 38 Days misspoke work sense supposed regards eliciting immune response wonder necessarily mean works mutated strain. believe sentence responded Dr's said mutually exclusive. realize half population still believe COVID exists? um test hbv titers throughout people's lives assess immunity Internet US invention. get scheduled get it? contact doctor basically?

If US going spread pathogen make obvious. need stop reading conspiracy theories. US: Nice try India, still win big.. really big” /s

Joking aside, really worrying see US number shows sign abating. Aye gotchu. Back negatives 😈. place really seem shitty tho :/ mentally ill often cant reason rationally still mandatory hospital staff emergency services. long stays way? knows tend agree you. quoted you. fault case can't read, unless browser blocked quotes reason.

No doesn't. Nowhere quote mention banned tourists Wuhan Jan 21. mentions increased screening procedures including wholesale banning tourists Wuhan 21st. ever get worried? Worried injure mental gymnastics perform twist reality bullshit propaganda stuff various orifices? 

Hong Kong Macau autonomous, they're window dressings CCP authoritarianism. Taiwan actually autonomous, that's able ban tourists mainland China without Beijing removing leader.

Hey could also discuss Tiananmen Square? many student protestors think died there? 52% really bad. Plus give 1 dose everyone, nothing lower demand. people still need two shots proper dosage schedule.

So right, point. point wasting vaccine.  Every single dose give nothing reduce total amount people still needing two shots.  Further, studies read transmission among young children suggests kids contracting COVID-19 adults live. parent vaccinated young child not, child still gains protection virus. lol.. look fucking losers profile.. created account literally go around say hates republicans call people white supremacists, nazis, ""republicans"" disagrees.. thats fucking sad people hahahahaha mom (age 55) tested positive. underlying health conditions, chances she'll severe illness? They're behind curve deals. Anyone knows is? course would work. choice, live tiny apartment go jail. Living street longer option.

As said, nobody guts actually this, happen things stay are. Look, going object reality, courage say ""I care many people cause get sick die want pretend happening."" Like, I'd respect level honest sociopathy. Saying like it, fair, unreasonable... irrelevant whining. either think fun worth people dying don't. courage come say think people die entertainment. Unless suppressed immunity, probably longer contagious 10 days. said, it’s average, think it’s pretty irresponsible people like, welp! Day 11, time party! employers like, welp! Day 11, must return work teach 60 kids per day. People understanding discomfort...but won’t be.

Coughing, snerking, rough voice linger literally weeks months fully clearing virus — even though it’s gross, it’s necessarily dangerous. Yeah you’re right that. I’ve caught depression hadn’t thought yet. Thank perspective. support sentiment covid-19, preventable/semi-preventable health problem? We've always patients stacked hallway sorts diagnoses, whether acute surgical issues transfusions whatnot. patients guaranteed room people coming acute traumas need trauma equipped rooms them. I'm busy metro area volumes high. norm numerous hospitals area we're already far worst I've personally seen hospitals area crazy get.

Now think putting people hallway bad seen resort COVID surge here. working literal 2x4's nailed together around plastic tarping temporary ICU. Hot dog. Reddit censoring free speech 20% chance sever side effects second dose :) exciting! love rushed vaccines lowest bidder  actually people vaccinated might still able infect people organize delivery food necessities ensure people can. medical procedure today anesthesiologist sticker back hospital ID (or kind key card) stated he'd gotten vaccine. congratulated told thought deserved glad he'd gotten it. Great guy. Thank service! really want vaccine, effectively work home, I'll wait patiently front line workers people risk get first. know work. city's homeless services makes contact people living parks time. many come shelter stick tent. lol, significant point? get 2nd time, still need 2 correct schedule.

You wasting supply. Anyone getting one dose still needs another 2 doses later proper schedule. Honest question - since person received second dose, really say anyone vaccinated time? job go working terrible conditions appease selfish individuals want take seriously. sign that. free think best interest. 

I find funny can't understand that, yet want probably complain restrictions forced you. RESTRICTIONS ME! GET BACK WORK! pain compare TDaP? findings indicate around 90,000 incident symptomatic infections, corresponding 9 10 cases, ascertained surveillance system first 7 weeks following lockdown May 11 June 28 2020

Note they’re talking first wave here. 

France hit 500k tests one day days ago first time. Still don’t mouth swab tests though would make three accessible everyone. imbalance that? persisted, probably get checked ASAP. Could nothing course, also symptom stroke Thats interesting nearly 4 10 Americans permanently dropped school failing complete 6th grade. Hospital coder. Last week director asked headcount many people interested getting vaccine. Got email schedule today. co-worker get January 4th. 20 million end year, huh? 1 down, 332 go. fucking kidding me?

I'm british, i'm starting loathe canadians reddit. always acting sanctimonious like better yanks. Poor americans, they're shat everyone here. Could please point brought Florida all? Well asume everybody lying proven otherwise, including china hospital, people waiting see effects coworkers got it. One guy sweated profusely. One guy nausea--a known side affect. friend said getting tiny chance side effects. told took fine. tiny chance--regardless inconvenient side effect day--that keeps taking vaccine. get it. look it, there. problem one COPD CHF would ever allowed aboard. way conditions COVID cause low oxygen saturation. Also, nail polish cold hands cause falsely low readings. smoking prior measuring cause false high readings carbon monoxide binds hemoglobin. God damnit that's third time week! problem government pays 99% cost, 99.99%

Then government get 99% profits. getting downvoted hell Reddit hospital we've often busy enough people stacked hallway getting sorts things including transfusions even pre-COVID. I'm guessing medical center typically slammed ordinary them.

If go inner-city hospital that's heavily underfunded even worse that. can't wait get headlines like ""kids go back school"", ""stadiums 50% capacity"", ""Concerts held people attendance"", seeing restrictions get lifted incredibly enjoyable!! true all. Plenty viruses give long term immunity.

Sterilizing immunity coronviruses last 6-24 months.

Shorter term immunity quite common similar RNA viruses well.

For type virus is, long term sterilizing immunity would atypical. 

Your comment wrong around, much nuance it. You’re deluding yourself. semblance royalty actually exists elsewhere minor league shit compared opulence buys US. 

Call crown, police, Conservatism dates back loyalists licking royal boots revolution resist change maintain established social order. aren’t free almost anyone, misperception embarrassing happen fast, takes time symptoms show, even time fester. deserves more. Young people much likely spread around. giving vaccine reduces spread sooner. lives saved overall. southern Californians reacted pandemic justifies refusing move there. absolute number sequenced better measure percentage sequences we're trying workout likelihood country picks virus first? Say NZ/Taiwan sequences everything case tops chart, they're still unlikely record new variance since cases. Individual mRNA transcripts translated once. Individual transcripts contain distinct feature called polyA-tail that, intact, protects degradation. time exonucleases chew polyA-tail transcript undergoes normal RNA decay. least couple mechanisms don’t involve deadenylation don’t really know those. richest country world tent cities? Again, simply distribute doses pairs keep second dose first, way around it. cannot gamble 2nd doses showing try innocuulate people faster. Streaming doses across shipments risks getting 2nd dose time.

Also, better 1st 2nd dose manufacturing run cold chain shipment case something went wrong. doses different batches used, bad batch, invalidate two batches worth instead one. lockdowns became less following science control cannot compare deaths per capita state that’s warm year round state becomes deals freezing temperatures half year. Regardless politics that’s stupid argument.  case, going see number deaths drop? Maybe months? showed 1 1000 second positive test 90 days. realize reinfection occur, person exposed again, right? every single person previously exposed going second exposure. Understand reading. That’s fund vaccination programs schools. Paul? That’s really YOU? OMG trying find you. think wife gave herpes.  There's easy solution homelessness, neither political side wants it.

You build bunch tiny apartments edge every large city. Tiny, 1 room 100 square foot apartments. Then, move homeless people them. give free food. ban sleeping street anywhere.

This gets homeless streets, without causing added issue creating homeless. Nobody homeless person going want live tiny apartment building full homeless people. homeless people often want live there, arrested keep trying sleep parks on.

The left never agree apartments nice enough, want homeless people free live parks shit street. right agree want waste tax dollars, even though wasting much tax dollars various homeless programs, plus result homeless hospitalized time. travel *ANYWHERE* allowed right begin with? **Stay fuck home.** man dude left wing social justice warrior max.. hes using fake account cause im assuming ones fucking dumb Either 1% serious issues offended need seek help.

Thats like pet food money hoe. common see Reddit people shitting America universal healthcare, certainly necessary. also appears Redditors want universal healthcare themselves; would like anti-maskers, realistically people accused anti-maskers, receive healthcare due contracting disease. people realize country universal healthcare, treat EVERYONE? could failed every single class took school, still get healthcare. could gone prison committing gruesome murders, still get healthcare. could world record number days spent hospital, still get healthcare. matter problems have, still get healthcare.

While anti-maskers certainly stupid dangerous, idea treating people due accusation anti-maskers even stupid dangerous. hospital deny someone right receive medical care purely suspicion patient anti-masker, taking revenge patient. Instead would endangering even people kicking patient out, since patient might use excuse go socialize, since ""healthy"" now. Moreover, already system determining gets medical care called triage. triage, thankfully, based fantasies revenge.

actually guy Berkeley invented PCR taking symposium held centenarian Albert Hofmann, Hofmann said Mullis told LSD ""helped develop polymerase chain reaction helps amplify specific DNA hmmm...all ""groups"" irresponsible.  younger people likelier survive. Hence, left phase 3 r/coronavirus strange place. I’m sure narrative is. Understandably anti-vax seems swing far opposite way times. test pending still saw you? works hospital supervise 911 Dispatch center part first tier state. **Plenty coworkers want it** hopefully soon everyone start getting doses actually want them.

Don't want others prioritized? want intend get it? I'm directing you, honestly anyone working hospital setting required get major vaccinations - sake patients see... That’s true anymore. vaccine willingness including people want wait bit first 75%. need keep there, it’s spiked since first shots started coming Protective against? What? Reinfection? mean, kind defeats purpose. purpose get infected first place. 

If mean reinfection, overall population, yeah. around same. older population, vaccine going protective due immune response SARS-CoV-2 older individuals. 'It took nine months California record 1 million confirmed cases COVID-19.""

""It taken less six weeks see 1 million more.""

"" Nov. 12, state averaging 7,000 new coronavirus cases per day, 4,000 people treated virus hospitals. Tuesday, California averaging 45,000 cases per day past week, number COVID patients hospitals climbed past 19,000. patients treated COVID-19 California’s hospitals today hospitalized spring peak virus New York. "" Uh. No. Employers never scared worker backlash. aren’t going mandate there’s nothing do. like many done little protect workers far. Good, slack going back dose #2 matter busy are. Biontech used American tech form vaccine FINALLY someone else gets it. recommending even get shot. Without antibodies, run real risk reinfection also carrier disease others. I've already 3 patients back hospital sick 6 months ago. long period testing negative them...yet sick enough land hospital again. 


I'm sure happened people seem think sub sick covid, near permanent immunity clear. making gnash teeth frustration. coworkers also got covid also signing get shot first chance let us. us nearly died first time eager repeat experience. us seen enough cases reinfection know vaccine neccessary longer lasting antibodies help bring pandemic close. There's nothing implausible claimed, basically ignored idea going phased trials let regular people basically work trial subjects. that's way would done I'm entirely convinced entirely wrong either setting pandemic. got vaccinated! sore arm day two. issues otherwise!! Bro you’re super critical it’s 10 days we’re big ass country. whole point. answer yes, things speed up. 10 days. It’s like we’ve dealt something like before. Covid making every country things haven’t done like distribute vaccine basically whole population. Like guy said we’re #3 vaccinations per capita it’s like something going terribly wrong  Looks like UK Israel vaccinated highest rate far. Exponential growth, like virus.  Million dollar question. planning too. Oxford vaccine first, followed mRNA vaccine available. I'm sure safe take like Canada passed legislation provide compensation citizen injured vaccine. valid point. people think need hospitals grocery stores survive. people perfectly fine eating Applebee’s shopping Walmart rest lives.

I don’t think way. opinion local restaurants small businesses necessity healthy community. got Pfizer shot last week. year's flu shot LOT worse first Covid shot me. We'll see 2nd dose like. Fortunately/unfortunately gotten 2nd penis warned getting ""rushed"" vaccine  mean older population though? weaker response virus vaccines?

They hyperinflammatory response virus. strong response one necessarily elicit immunity B cell response completely screwed lack better way put it. vaccine focus response RBD region spike protein without hyperinflammatory response. Let's use better sources shall we?? joking hall beds homeless people.

The strike isn’t rooms. It’s staffing. coming China. need 2 doses. right move. need 2 doses full protection, give one, entire effort wasted.

Remember: get infected, already 85% chance higher mild symptoms. single dose even protect better anything? That's problem we're facing. give everyone 2 doses try smart it. sounds like miracle me. nice see one location hit 70%ish vaccination actually see hospitalization numbers drop... would give enough credit vaccine everyone fighting it. article specifically American homeless tent city. though? 

He’s saying will.. opposed exactly? something called hyperscusis, causes intense pain response every day sounds (dishes clanking, cars honking, chatter restaurants etc). real treatment expose noise, given pain response rather difficult do.

Especially US trump UK brexit. guess that’s special relationship that. least end day. Especially since survivor 2 Million... coronavirus originate China propagate population inhumane unhygienic wet markets? Incredible! goal 20 mill

its gonna cure population Don’t spend 250 million people choose ignore pandemic. Use money invest future country listened science got vaccinated. Especially grocery store. 

I customer say loud yesterday covid, fine care. Well fuck store going entire night shift sick covid. yet figure out. based biases. based immunological response SARS-CoV-2 disease pathogenesis. would rare event person test positive 90 days infection. might find case two that's happened somebody chemotherapy/immunotherapy something like leukemia lymphoma agammaglobulinemia, going far between. cases pop like going shift number reinfections significantly down. Since really don’t wish ill anyone, hope neither you, elderly mother end gasping oxygen due ignorant stupidity. Fingers crossed work heard shouldn’t hard make modify vaccine work new variant necessary. got mine 12 hrs ago. arm barely sore- hurt way years flu shot. hope mines working!! shit big problem long trump quietly covered simply talked Obama president media didn’t allow look bad. maybe many saffers UK/ Europe going back home visit? Im reading any. asked said ""no way"". Ok. Maybe Im wrong yet completely ignore brand new strain going around. far over. sound like Trump calling win far early. Yes, important note, change fact screwed testing procedure, even regulator determined screw enough warrant throwing step repeating (though seem waiting US data sort thing). Let’s count chickens get SECOND dose. count Covid.... Covid exist, death happened. Hopefully get bunch votes. We'll that. Thank you! No, really, that’s vaccine intended work. Sure, also sounds very... authoritarian...

American politicians completely ignore homeless problem acting like world’s ATM. criticize it, get called xenophobic. ignore homeless issue there’s nothing 1 citizen it, get called names too. Often people called xenophobic suggesting stop starting interventionist wars shipping money countries rather helping people. Can’t win. Yeah new strain? you’re bad guy here. can’t imagine what’s going dumb head... covid you’re still coughing stay home! don’t care CDC Guidelines say you’re fine 10 days, it’s guideline absolute rule. don’t want em near me. Imo 2 consecutive negative pcr tests taken least 3 days apart go around people anymore. 300 million go... I’ve heard NSAIDS decrease immune response better take before/after vaccine isn’t. across country time. cities this, particular city flooded homeless people. Even Fauci said thanksgiving surge. fear sensible probably people took fair bit precautions (there lot testing matter fact). I’m guessing slightly half people *can* take vaccine actually *will* first round. still lot health care workers a) saying virus isn’t bad media says b) taking vaccine. 

It doesn’t matter me, know they’ll keep offering next line, point getting people want priority. understand people hesitant, I’m glad least option now. Sure ideas. Two them!

They SPENDING BAAAAAAAD MADIGAN BAAAAAAD.

I can’t argue second one. [Exaggerated risk transmission COVID-19 risk SARS-CoV-2 transmission fomites real-life They'll mandate hospital bills unvaccinated people catching covid start coming in. Vaccinating workers cheaper covering bills covid treatments. they're paying bills directly health insurance premiums worker's comp premiums start increasing insurers find they're mandating. Prevention always cheaper clean up. Unless variant viruses come play. many white people getting it. flu argument one biggest dumbass quotes ever.

My family said said good know got flu I’m coming since it’s big deal.

Funny get flu year ago tell stay home get better. god damn covid politicized orange twat waffle killed millions downplay “just like flu”...Well don’t like shit either! FYI: visible US. Mine similar arm soreness TDaP. know covid-19 positive infected someone plane elsewhere travels. see. administrators even patient-facing? Even ER staff don’t get tested twice per week... I'm caping anybody, I've taking care patients hallways ER years find ridiculous see redditors downvoting someone saying unusual strange everyone else makes sound like incredible astounding occurrence never happen million years. really think ""only homeless"" that's honestly dehumanizing homeless begin frankly touch reality. I've done plenty volunteer medical work third world nations even though hallway fantastic end world everyone reddit trying paint it.

What care right patients spread infections isolation done correctly, every non-COVID patient hallway that's reality life. rooms going needed isolate infectious patients.

I also understand expect hospital do, can't magically create 100x rooms. failure society government controlling pandemic, failure particular hospital see people whining patients hallway help anything. definitely felt like arm soreness worse flu shot, mine brief. coresidents got symptoms chills, generalized body aches, headache lasted day. didn’t get symptoms. covid, losing taste smell hands worst part me. scared wouldn’t get back (like months senses) sucks able taste food keep making completely wrong points even reading others suggesting. never said give everyone single dose like post trying say.

I said need hold back dose every individual future production cover second doses. moves first vaccine date 3 weeks number people. significant.

You keep dismissing fact single dose benefit trying put words mouth (as well replying comment even chain). even know TRALI is? Yeah probably, summer start thing, we’re 9 months people it. 6 people know last two weeks gotten it, 2 wedding, 3 weekend away friends 1 nail salon little compliance. 3 months ago, none people would even consider things lockdown fatigue mixed summer holidays making people complacent. Exactly that’s meant. saying one go around trying get infected protected next. saying portion population might protected extent similar vaccinated population. help get herd immunity quickly (despite failure per se course).

I feel pain, instances like wish single didn’t deal someone else. Actually reason nobody wants it’s never ending problem. Without federal funding states cities might own, municipality offers support homeless attracts droves. It’s localized problem transient nature, makes pretty unique. You’d end problem homeless shelters - capacity serving needy. Antibodies kind key preventing reinfection (or initial infection case vaccination). However, study really good one terms what's going happen general population. Health care workers likely continuously exposed SARS-CoV-2 work. keep antibody titers higher would seen general population infected. Also, know always focusing IgG antibodies pretty well known going need strong IgA antibody response prevent reinfection line upper respiratory tract basically first line reinfection. SARS-CoV-2 general population, IgA antibody titers drop quickly good sign. company better get ready pay out. Especially safety critical industry like military, health care, education food service could impact people get sick.

If case come companies require employees get flu shot, pneumonia shot, tetanus shot, etc.? know company never required show proof got them.

What people can't get vaccine medical purposes? Religious purposes? 

Don't get wrong, support vaccine get can. think companies force someone get vaccine. keep saying, allowed live streets. either live apartment, go jail. trump thing. rendered irrelevant context. Many doses held back second doses. saying doses ship exist wrong, particularly PFE vaccine. cannot anything fucking troll. Seriously. GTFO. full shit feel you. work wound care facility work getting vaccine anytime soon. outpatient considered frontline workers. test temperatures well. coworker tested positive facility still requiring employees get tested regularly. Patients good far, we’ll see things go Hire* countries financial positions provide funding vaccine research.

I'm talking vaccine research. I'm talking abou doses vaccine. Canada bought far many population, smaller countries could fair shot getting, redistributed places Canada likes guise ""charity"". doses go middleman? Need restrictions tracing vaccinate non-healthcare frontline workers? People cashiers Wal-Mart definitely closer front (behind elderly immunocompromised). 

I dog fight, I'm frontline worker. read fucking headline?? explains. dudes picture look like dance Capoeira, sick moves way Canada almost deified reddit lol

You know Canadian American healthcare systems ranked 30s worldwide (and that's including cost) got news website, example. Why?

And I'm congress celebrity either. guy charge leading it. forget trillions given away unlimited qe liquidity stock market ever get paid back. That’s valid point. want work unsafe conditions? 

Would like volunteer job strike? I’m sure could use extra hands, kind generous attitude you’d make great hospital aide. healthcare workers receiving now? That's false lol.

How?? 95% vs 70% (or even 62%) effectiveness.

If argument I'm willing hear it, even Fauci said there's real reason approve AZ vaccine two exist. Balkans Baltic countries now? believe although there's one candidate uses different volumes second shot. think that's AstraZeneca one entirely different platform statement apply. wrong Early March, could later February depending J&amp;J approved. People downers, roll happen quite quick January. Everyone pretty much wear mask now, persists. mean taking supply market countries could bought

Poorer countries financial positions provide funding vaccine research. Companies research unless know there's payoff, leaves larger countries foot bill promise buy vaccine. also means end buying shit ton vaccines redistributed countries could afford purchase vaccines companies directly.

If buy poorer countries able afford buy anyway.

We've already donated extra COVAX part 2 billion doses given away, no, going 'our friends'. 

The US Europeans wealthy enough buy vaccine themselves. We're actually trying help inoculate everyone go back living lives Friday, Canada part announcement COVAX, global collaboration get COVID-19 vaccines poorer countries, agreements place access nearly two billion doses several vaccine candidates, enough protect vulnerable eligible countries first half earlier pledged $485 million support COVID-19 tests, treatments vaccines low middle income countries.

And there'd legal weed. I’m wondering it’s better administer 1 shot double amount people vaccinated.

Yep, sounds right. Hospitals already spread thin thousands Covid already. Staffing issue getting shots arms. logistics already fairly difficult regardless anybody says people administer, well......... mean, us social. I’ve miserable person lockdown used go literally 4-5 times week friends, cousins, coworkers, family, etc. 

I would get soooo damn tired 24/7 one person. Personally stop, unless feel symptomatic something He's saying 'a degree' normality 'November 2021' latest interview.

Never forget absolutely BEST year Fauci, Cuomo, Whitmer, Birx, etc's life.

As say masks stay even beat virus, social distancing long term disagree tons new grads. 

Not ideal, much worse throwing 7+ patients nurses. 

Also money talks. Pay enough people want work (second jobs, part time, per diem). lack communication city state Country leaders what's going hurt us. understand correctly United States government procuring vaccines Distributing states, leaving states administer shots. Problem nobody really page comes they're going they're going it. Think group project everybody wants way one agree proper way get done deadline. every complex problem, solution simple, obvious, wrong. 

Hospitals maximum capacity caring dying. spare staff spare rooms. 

This vaccination program supposed rely heavily private partners, like clinics national pharmaceutical chains. Like flu vaccine.

Do go hospital USA flu shot? get mine Walgreens, Walmart, Shopko (before bankruptcy). 95% effective

Here 20 candies. 1 make sick possibly die. must eat one.

Good luck!!! directly. exposed covid body rapidly react, neutralizing infection quickly destroying infected cells. Replication would effectively neutralized shedding much virus others, any.

Indirectly think it’s still possible could spread fomites get coughed infected touch surfaces, etc.  Republicans team players, captain team think much covid precautions. Hope ends 80 ish %. help contain COVID V2 vaccines appears take good. don’t know sure yet. evidence suggesting could actually covid cases year flu cases normal year. 

18 million confirmed covid likely 40-80 million total 18-19 flu season estimated 35 million cases. monitor allergic reactions LOL!

Maybe next time take serious beginning?? 
I see you’re saying. I’ve going LOT lately. even went Disney world September. 
But people least adjust little bit unfortunately lot people won’t it’s freedom whatever want. 
Unless it’s abortion, drugs, driving drunk, etc. seasonality combined increased saturation virus among population, sudden shift behavior. room improvement, here's bit context:

Louisville, KY population: ~620,000 92 murders 2019 151 2020

Baltmore, MD population: ~600,000 348 2019 310 2020

Milwaukee, WI population: ~590,000 98 2019 184 2020

Albuquerque, NM population: ~560,000 82 2019 75 2020. You’d wrong. hospitals administering slower supply would allow. It’s difficult process observe every recipient 15 min vaccine given observe Covid isolation precautions, it’s really time space consuming process. It’s slow we’re slowly getting together. rate increase. though, rate limiting step hasn’t physical volume vaccine unfortunately. Yup, suck. I'm excited big LARP event late 2021. No.  lot reasons this. Florida, one, hit first wave back spring, Illinois, specifically, Chicago region, was. Also, look case numbers now, Florida much higher IL now, rising falling significantly. PCR tests (not rapid result) 5 days post exposure generally pretty accurate. 

Actually, really. point false negative % still around 67%. lowest false negative rate 20% around day 8 exposure. dental work done, course experience may different yours, felt pretty safe. think there's probably bigger risk staff patients. 

It uncomfortable, new procedures equipment try keep anything flying around much. vacuum thing mouth flap covered throat, felt like spraying everything water usual. 

I numbers point felt comfortable it. Well, Covid safe part. throat Hoover super uncomfortable. right, know sure, honestly care. 2 rapid tests came back negative even antibody revealed virus past. 2nd rapid test day flew. quarantined week traveled.

As far I'm concerned took every precaution could take. Every activity inherent risk felt like taking precautions worth risk. confident virus virus now. People need start assessing risk stop relying government tell do. “Rising”..well gone UP..so one would assume “RISING”. Ok, aren’t getting 200,000 cases day..doesn’t mean aren’t “RISING” though.. Yea got better treating virus. anyone denying this? original said responded to? might note Democrats passed covid relief chamber hold majority in, would aren’t mentioned government support people financially everything gets closed indefinitely though? want control not? Quit flip flopping address shit. We've seen lack direction do.... stupid would look millions people get second dose weeks afterwards?

The fact matter is, damned do, damned don't. situation dire now, better conservative. Keep Simple, Stupid.

I think exactly right thing. current population U.S. 2020 **331,002,651.** Depending state, essentially works. button clicked vaccine administered message gets sent state immunization reporting. I’ve three times since May, multiple members family. You’ll fine that's one get right now? able make appointment local drug store get vaccine? I'm hurry I'd like wait high risk people get first, curious anyone prediction. Sorry dumb question complete grasp phobia could go doctors office lay eyes closed don’t see feel pinch it’s over? Original couple months ago talking two co-workers phone. says go, ambulance street. Maybe 30 minutes later back phone. starts talking neighbor, small daughter around 3. another neighbors house pool. Well, pulled blue kid pool raced away ambulance. know outcome. found incredibly sad broke phone, canceling meeting. found sad, this, much. fyi, girl ok. matter? ok let white people die, black people? 320% go sinus headache, home remedies might help - staying hydrated + little bit steam inhalation + honey/ginger tea, etc? also absolutely zero idea treat back well. Adjusted age could say death rate America would 0.8-0.9%, however treatments today that’s reduced lot. Hospitals arguably negative impact many patients, putting ventilators oxygen went 87. know oxygen levels go way virus recover normally. know venting, I'm sure bf great qualities, big yikes. Personally, kind thing would break someone over. I'm saying bad person, kind person want team forever. Well, surprised. situation pretty dire. similar infection levels per capita Us less testing. hope start tracking number people vaccinated Thank God pandemic over. Back pubs boys! wouldn’t make anti-US headline lol. 

As far I’m concerned US see much traffic places. Additionally, really need sequence tiny portion people within community transmission outbreak locations. example NYC starts spread new strain could sequence ~50 random people area draw generalizations population strong confidence intervals. last thing I’ll add. US capability blow countries water. It’s matter politicians wanting happen. need immunity claims employers.  probably long shot, Madigan vulnerable he's ever been. I'm coming back Dover. trucks empty amd finishing rotation.


They going home, bringing anything back UK states talking about, already, allowing pharmacy technicians administer vaccines. 

I say nine years pharmacy tech experience, best 20% pharmacy techs would competent enough pull without wasting significant amount doses. probably closer 10%. people different front line healthcare completely overwhelmed next best thing terms getting ""boots ground"" far concerned without taking nurses doctors ERs/ICUs. again, lot smart folks could pull off.

We can't get desperate. Stick plan run risk prolonging pandemic. Yay mean, second one wrong, terrible governor.  5000 bajillion% chance fake numbers. Well post specificity nejm seem bit left field..I mean can't deny born vag female born peen male. change sex desire identify neither sexes, still can't really deny biological gender giving test trace system far credit think missed one infection every one caught. 5x conservative estimate based test positivity rate. multiplier likely higher. That's extraordinarily expensive gamble turned vaccine work major side effects stage 3 trials. diamond princess death rate 1.6%, percentage 65+ also like 45% population compared 16% USA 17-22% european countries. 

The key stat case fatality rate. key stat hospitalization. hospitalizations convert death overrun system. Every single person hospitalized ship got bed prompt medical attention. things available right many hospitals across America, it'll get worse. Also, mention converting rate princess diamond cruise ship stats **adjust age.** voted down? see much hypocrite Jan mad Chinese keep traveling despite new virus going , they're without batting eye ? guess "" Rule thee , me"" standard mindset USA expect much better country like U.S track record morally wrong travel pandemic. unfortunate circumstance era find in. think it’s slow roll out? don’t know I’d blame government. military logistics groups running it. yes, type vaccine, scientists said could modified within 6 weeks it’s pretty hard tell you’re wearing two honestly !! usually grocery store &amp; work, cares ppl think i’m weird 🤟🏻 you, 12? Seriously, uses word ""cursing"". Like I'm casting spell lmao.

Grow up, read headline commenting. hard. right could imagine government regulations put place venues/businesses taxed ""COVID maintenance fee"" something like that, could waived venue/business demonstrate they've implemented certain features/policies.

Ensuring employees/customers vaccinated could one stipulation. People directly affected yet becoming careless. mods gonna ban bringing up! /s die? Yes watching unfold closely since New Zealand like contact tracing machines true personal responsibility.

Heath insurance life insurance based risk profiles, people saying vaccines changing risk profile outside established parameters.

They commons, get freedom choice freedom responsibility actions. thanksgiving specific surge you’d see everywhere Us national event. cursing me? okay, question dentists.

I wanted put pandemic think kind emergency point need go dentist. safe that? I'm scared going. relative already go, requested first appointment day fine. I'm gonna thing. 

it really makes so, nervous mouth open knows long less foot away people see god knows many people every day get right face. seems dangerous I'm genuinely getting headache thinking tooth rotting. advice thoughts would greatly appreciated still fucking joke people. Thanksgiving Californian celebration work one manufacturers one Covid vaccines aren’t getting vaccine either. would think facility actual manufacturing QC checks would highish list stay healthy continue produce batches. Rolling short time frame absolutely killed head count. We’ve many people quit throwing money us, company wasn’t hiring staff support super quick timeline. We’ve people working 19+ hr days, personally day months, etc. can’t afford people get sick everything grind halt. I’m trying selfish myself, I’m supervisor large portions job home therefore lower list, analysts needed every day lab. manufacturing workers every day. Losing one people huge impact staffing levels currently at. 

We site wide virtual meeting every month people asking leadership told us talks rolling us. think medical workers absolutely top list, think us producing vaccines least towards top bottom. You’re smart crazy. husbands family pressured us get 4th July said no. brothers household tested positive like 8 days after. would caught shit them. They’re still acting dumb taking kids see Santa masks too.  so? Keeping home come contact airport? Trumptowns government utterly effed up. completely heads rears. (You might guess I'm little pissed this!)

It looks like professional politicians wanted see local, Korean-made vaccine would cheaper could sell overseas, refused commit foreign made vaccines. Even now, still ""discussing"" contracts. They've saying would get vaccines February March, they'd hold months ""make sure safe."" 

I think missed window, ended back line, making excuses clear idea they'll actually get vaccines. seems like they're dropping PR ""test balloons"", making excuses seeing people buy. But, people really fed up. election now, guys would gone. 1/4 population Canada 4,751 sq mi 12,310 sq km. Losing taste smell usually means easier go people lose senses. Certainly makes great headlines doesn’t Source surface transferring transmitting virus well? I’ve washing hands pretty frequently touching groceries it’d nice piece mind. Marco? Polo? Nope. Doug Ducey. gave patio heaters help. if. So, math, 9 years vaccinate everyone America one dose vaccine rate 100,000 per day. 18 years 2 doses.

Or 70% immunised get herd immunity 229,740,000 people take 6 years one dose. 12 years 2 doses.

They need ramp vaccination speed lot more. That’s 1/328 people, 0.023%. Good progress that’s nowhere near enough I’ll say it: herd immunity. shit used happen normally modern medicine viruses didn’t start occurring 1900s somehow humans managed progress despite coexisting viruses modern medicine. Yes it’s herd immunity matter anyone else fucking says I’m tired hearing can’t say it. “let rip”. No. Governments public health officials trying prevent that’s still what’s happening herd immunity begin take hold spite attempts. That’s nature. It’s happens always happened many viruses like this. think rules can't describe sad makes us.  Yeah says actually happen?

Much like current leader saying wants give everyone two grand. 

Why table earlier? grand-standing. Well, nothing ""free"". would subsidized Mexican taxpayers, indirectly paid person.  Yes, seems likely. BioNTech put statement saying could tweak vaccine work new strain around 6 weeks needed. Health care provider data US Europe. COVID specifically, young skinny(non-smoker, heart issues) puts lowered risk severe complications literally offered anyone, regardless insurance thinking situations. best case scenario, less likely get it. worst case scenario, people might notice look funny. Nope. husband's best friend getting married week, sister Florida weeks that. wanted fly both, (quickly, credit) dissuaded gently me.

And know what? BF sister good people actually care him...no hard feelings! sucks never gets spend time either (hell normal circumstances would psyched either trip), tempting. Spaghetti sucks. 

This comment paid Fettuccine Gang can't allow recovered COVID patients proof antibody presence hold mass events? There's 18 million confirmed cases US alone, possibly 60 million include get test. fair deny right live normal life? I’ve followed story. tragic loss. top many tragic unnecessary losses. ""Why triggered lib nurses help treat China flu, exist?"" Random question, know covid Jan? It’s “I tell arm got in” feeling, better?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  problems ramping solved. got mine yesterday. I’m respiratory therapist hospital major city. I’ve seen shit. 

No side effects far all, except tell arm got in. Probably going happen next weeks. They’re shooting 20M vaccinated first week January. Right US sitting 18.4M cases. THAT'S rebuttal 250 scientific papers around world?  10 million people flew Thanksgiving., restaurants reopened time, people got careless. that’s besides anti-maskers lock protesters political nut cases on. think entity taking 30% everyone’s salary every year, 30% revenues corporations, 5% sales tax everything sold doesn’t money give back people? think really varies family family. personal family, know Christmas tends bigger people work either eve day always gatherings days. Vaccinated FIRST DOSE* 

Guarantee hundreds thousands people go party one dose end spreading more. interesting see Let's see second shots arrive. told heroes back april /s Straight I’m already limiting distancing pre vaccine. Basically parents vaccinated protection, I’m way less worried. people people probably point time. us prepared takes help keep people safe. think tipping point financial state country rather people think. I'm sure much longer go funding jobs businesses God knows many going go wall near future due restrictions. agree sentiment post wanna point truckers transporting goods kinds include biohazard materials, waste, yes... frozen/refrigerated goods. don’t think that’s much concern. someone stated above, mobilize country like WWII. weren’t concerned men women never mad tanks bombs went roll historical rate. Forget government it’s people gonna pull us thru terrible time! cowardice.  

They're kind like draft dodgers necessary war.  Except much less asked them. yeah, least personal anecdote, even everyone still wearing masks pretty religiously Seoul, lot people getting fed restrictions. I'll curious see if/how new less-than-five-people restriction affects things going forward last count, 330,000,000 US citizens. Would listen Tony Blair told double pain meds. 
They work better says. Unfortunately, people learn understand experiencing themselves.  literally commenting thread based Operation Warp Speed. Google it. significant evidence systemic know, correct phrasing would “too few” instead “two little”, otherwise totally agree point least shaking hands dead Birx Fauci get travel photo ops, interviews, baseball pitches Thanksgiving. shouldn’t anyone else? think major issue would supply vaccines people willing take it. Considering world reacted virus overall, think countries actually paying enough attention notice? Lets pretend moment actually started US. infrastructure incredibly poor tracking things. Early on, regularly misidentified pneumonia. could certainly case went unnoticed. private heath insurance money went paying CEO yachts instead actual research development lol. first * point actually wildly wrong. classified ""starvation"" famine due economic factors seen such. Take example fine work Mike Davis late Victorian holocausts. live capitalism dominates world. honestly think heard ""econ"" 101 defenses rebuttals every single day adult life?

Lol didn’t find global progress Econ 101 doesn’t make less wrong. Famine time low. Claiming otherwise bold face lie. There’s reason poorest nations earth struggling obesity rather famine. Claiming isn’t case iust make impossible take seriously. You’re desperate contrarian taking opinion equivalent flat earther absurd would tell greater economic freedom served laboring hacienda system united fruit provided bananas cheaper. abhorrent insanity act isn't.

Ah yes cheap food oppression... cause makes china

Lie cases? Silence protestors? Authoritarian solutions? Like that’s really want? honestly going sit say that’s want? I’m awe actually believe nonsense. absolute decay mind extraordinary country could manage logistics face masks sanitizer six months advanced notice somehow going accompish this?

The US sold hand sanitizer, face masks vaccines country. scared capitalism would let mind decay acknowledging actually know probably waste time, really, loved one dies going say ""well least listening market signals""? die wish invested bitcoin made friends? perfectly obvious system thresher live now, better world possible.

When loved one dies famine say “at least didn’t suffer capitalism!” let ideology meet brain. can’t accept reality vaccines produced democratic west capitalism solved logistical issue transporting vaccine requires low temps. aren’t willing acknowledge reason US vaccinated people country capitalist system place. can’t acknowledge reason innovations COVID front coming US system place spurs innovation.

I know waste time. Ideology virus. manipulated much aren’t willing anymore acknowledge reality. cares data shows point something guy 1800s said perfectly obvious system thresher live now, better world possible.

No shit. turns capitalism leading technological progress get there. hope got mine right away ;) new control measures, including closing schools universities, might necessary. Even may enough, noted, saying, “It may necessary greatly accelerate vaccine rollout.”

Should anyway. Lol, US going hitting rate tens millions per month March so. thing slow availability vaccine. I'm French live States too, also think great! Nice quote way. I'm 30.

Explains found pants fit Costco. NY Times created dashboard week ago. I’m sure they’ll making improvements time. Right it’s state level. 

Their dashboards good pandemic actually subscribed one open see. sad, maddening... loss. hope Dr Bannec guy loses medical licence. county currently 8% total confirmed infection rate almost fatalities age 75. like care killing everyone's grandparents. lower efficacy rely around also inoculated herd immunity effect. Lots people would need shot control spread. think fair say would never fly US many conspiracy nuts around. maybe China, people socially minded enough. Tested positive June 18th, haven’t gotten since. go time time bars stuff. Wear KN95 mask shop, eat restaurants, go places.  Anyone else feel good inside right vaccine news? 1 million + vaccinated already. beginning end guys.

Does anyone know find info sheet show anti-covid vax peers? family members want explain take vaccine. Maybe something explaining chances unknown long term side effect, something comparing vaccines taken?

Thanks! It’s legitimately one greatest achievements human history. mom boat therefore we’ve barely able see her. It’s frustrating her. said “we literally take anyone street may find 2 days later covid”. get first vaccine today. must state decision. I’m sorry. plan getting party get vacinated? Regardless plan it, give many articles young people dying that. Anyone Mexico here? looking someone isn’t negative subreddit, r/covidmx supposed place learn COVID Mexico instead turned place judge others enjoying staying home bunch people claiming never go back normal wear masks until, 2024. It’s actually worse subreddit. K watch, it’s going happen front real time. thing slow vaccine availability. True...you know think it, drive thru head...but means getting car I’m truly interested. guess makes wonder many like may like “yeah, sounds little difficult, pass” never find out. actually wanted try get appointment, registered system one testing sites - joke like fifty steps. questions, creating account huge password, getting like two text verifications. Literally 20 minutes I’ll never get back. find appointments. actually super pissed thought “alright fuck it, Guess y’all don’t want get test.”

Though husband don’t see anyone totally isolated socially except trip grocery store like week...I work home essential job, thankfully working warehouse like half day. sleep ok night feeling like I’m part. seems matter. Okay, rant over! Lol California talk scary travel state one wears masks. 40 million people California almost 500 cities you’re basing knowledge headlines handful communities. 
I love new narrative California people would stop coming here. won’t miss ya lmao see least people facemask pulled nose way pretty much everyday. guys gate remind people put masks. Assholes still pull get past entrance sight.


I ride mostly brown line Taipei.


Only one time seen someone run towards lady inside facemask telling put mask on. near beginning pandemic. get vaccinated. Especially around holidays. vaccine today! terrible year doorknob licking community JFC, mutations literally happening everywhere, nothing mutation found protein within **the COVID-19 cell**. ramifications yet determined.

It virus. cell.

FFS. aunt's doctor lectured quite vigorously keep mask properly. middle getting diagnosed advanced lung cancer told mask interfering breathing keep nose. wearing N-95 face shield. glad see fully enforced. many locals idiots.

When fire department says caused house burn down, don’t say “the house caused burn down”. say kitchen fire whatever caused it. ....aaaaand?

I'm POC news me. Population density:

Brazil - 25.06 people per square kilometer

Peru - 25 people per square kilometer

Chile - 26 per Km2

Sweden - 25 per Km2

Finland - 18 per km2

Norway - 15 per Km2

Denmark - 137 per Km2 first wave didn’t know virus acted yet. Tylenol, extra strength, round clock. Hydroxychloroquine time actually possibly going anyway autoimmune disease, alas know it’s helpful corona. also rescue inhaler every hours, cough med, given tramadol. Honestly helped little. least help sleep maybe needed deep sleep body fight. sleeping two days straight made side. crazy. Like one day everything crazy horrible. one day, could finally breathe without much pain. Fever started going away. Intense experience! Swine flu *did* [become case unaware hear single person Earth complaining cost?   lol can't believe it? majority POC America aware racial hierarchy United States. majority time, nobody dies it. Keep good work get shots faster. 250K cases day 3,000 deaths day surge? majority people, still early stages Healthcare people, much else. way optimistic fast ramp up. Combine current admin actively sabotaging efforts lucky 20mil end January Pretty awful well. Got Pfizer today, same-not side effects stiff/sore upper arm. may partially needle, hurt worse flu shot noticeably longer I'm used to. Deaths per capita:

Illinois: 130/100k

Iowa: 114/100k

Wisconsin: 82/100k

Missouri: 86/100k

Indiana: 120/100k

Illinois done worse every one bordering states. governors praising case die. case now? Article MidWest:   now, two weeks later — long enough holiday transmission start register official tallies — regional post-Thanksgiving spike speak of.

  sure, slowdown reporting holiday briefly reduced daily case counts, backlog last week briefly inflated them, producing fluctuations curve. big picture since Thanksgiving, average number new daily cases fallen 19 percent Illinois; 22 percent South Dakota; 23 percent Minnesota; 25 percent Wisconsin; 27 percent Montana; 38 percent Wyoming; 41 percent Iowa; 48 percent North Dakota. Especially hasn’t really “waves”, steady climb since fall started. I’m convinced it’s seasonal/weather related activity related. Yeah, nobody would wanted take responsibility.

But would kept tens thousand, hundreds thousands alive. Meanwhile australia done nothing, jacinda gets shit done general, media rarely reports good news since people less interested hear things working normal making small incremental improvements

A lot journalists see impact exposing problems issues addressed - cause media narrative seem extra depressing. 

Though case, situation USA pretty concerning overall - pessimism warranted unfortunately really matter number cases already? US States even managed deploy 10% vaccines in-hand. We're screwed unless cut red tape whatever holding things radically accelerate vaccination. show math there? get vaccinating 20% vulnerable - means exactly- get covid deaths flu level? don’t believe large part treatments covid like tamiflu insanely high level community spread. protocols anti- coagulants dexamethasone, etc - widely available treatment. amount virus community high, I’m sure idea significantly reduces deaths.

Can explain calculation? Okay then.

Illinois: 130/100k

Iowa: 114/100k

Wisconsin: 82/100k

Missouri: 86/100k

Indiana: 120/100k

Illinois done worse every one bordering states. governors praising again? Ask one nurses talk getting shot. Keeps mind occupied :) easy, many vaccine programs faced delays failure? haven't, good BioNTech Moderna? Realistically speaking, long gotta wait things become normal again? lockdowns vaccinations done 

I live Indian subcontinent (not India) think poor country opt Oxford vaccine Blessings protecting others. January ugly. unhealthy skinny. “Skinny fat” means eat want unhealthy garbage metabolism breaks convert weight gain. It’s synthetic opiate. Less respiratory depression it’s partial agonist believe I’m pharmacist. experience doesn’t work well, makes people dizzy, kidneys fine I’d sent home naproxen Tylenol taken together. 

If you’re truly life life altering pain (long bone fracture, kidney stone, burns, etc; don’t mess around Tramadol. give people real stuff. question insurance issue, would seriously freak out, insurance held bunch moronically wealthy white dudes doctors hope isn’t reality. 

From experience actually covid badly, sending people home unless actual respiratory failure full. rationing ventilators point. in, choose save. That’s insurance issue. don’t expect get vaccine January stock holder, approve message. cells protective. act infected cells. So, cells activated, already ""reinfected."" 

T cells make antibodies. B cells do. cells signal B cells make antibodies. But, quick antibody response, need memory B cell survived. But, SARS-CoV SARS-CoV-2. different cell response. SARS-CoV Th2 response severe disease. SARS-CoV-2 Th1 response. one reason SARS-CoV vaccine failed elicited either vaccine associated hypersensitivity possibly even ADE. purpose, think. least easily. Lymphocytes (the cells make antibodies attack foreign material) automatically check self-reactivity (target one's body) produced. So, healthy individual, unlikely vaccine could trigger immune response one's cells; either antigen (the spike protein) recognized foreign response mounted, vaccine nothing.

It apparently *can* happen, though. (influenza) vaccine reported cause narcolepsy due causing autoimmune response. One explanation HA protein, influenza surface protein, similar enough hypocretin, brain protein associated sleep, immune response HA protein also destroying hypocretin causing sleep disorder, paper retracted lack reproducibility.

I know examples.

This information mostly college intro bio class, I'm sure got something wrong. Yet, still better elsewhere.   want reply downvoted far comment even show anymore. 

Because would ""unfair"" rest population ""responsible"" that's why. stay locked inside get value signal good person am, stay locked too. 

You may picked sarcasm asking completely valid question people inevitably shut knee jerk dedication ""safety"" without even really considering saying. Please keep asking kinds questions, they're helping turn tide irrational fear. partner dentist took things seriously. Super clean safe imo sub constantly telling ""formite transmission negligible!"".

Of course significant. Think people know got infected. Guess what, also remember touching face 100 times day using phone outside inside rubbing eyes. giving vaccines illegals means people cross border real motivation. Colombian-Venezuelan border far easier cross US-Mexico border. moment immigration rate 80.000 people ***daily.*** Bottom page 35 top page 37, two columns right. adverse reaction numbers increase massively second Ah old shifting blame trick. Kids learning young. vaccines normally shipped secure channels? would never buy vaccine street vendor... Canada send checks everyone unemployed? know UI benefit way Canada’s first time believe still time. several strains strep, necessarily analogous current situation.

But top that, frequently recurring bacterial infection *far* likely case initial course(s) antibiotics fully clearing infection. exacerbated people finishing course (stopping soon feel better), even finish full course, sometimes kill bacteria fully. cases, patients often prescribed stronger longer courses antibiotics order fully clear infection. position numbers worrying seems disagree running got moderna today, clinic gave 210 people total. single person adverse reaction. little tenderness shoulder... different vaccine. Congrats! Bought Microsoft products ? Yeah don’t really think “second wave”. Wow amazing! cool makes happy. 'American tech'? deaths per capita:

Illinois: 130/100k

West Virginia: 63/100k

So West Virginia much sunnier state death rate less half Illinois? think commented wrong thread. Awkward lol literally don’t actually, likely even cover CA let alone nation. print dimensioning returns consequences like inflation.

Is worth it? Maybe, think it’s pretty complicated certainly depends much aid long. regardless it’s like government extra hundreds billions trillions laying around run economy one working months years. Sure, like already overflown 2 million Venezuelans crossing last 5 years, need give rest Venezuela reason come Colombia right? sometimes wonder people question safety vaccines, find people apparently think make machines people build backyards. 

It's orders magnitude complicated describing. Drugs huge problem, top many people chronically homeless. Many mental issues, social issues, plain trouble staying home. Contrary popular cliche, organizations need money. problem actually get much much better actually set comprehensively solve problem. Social workers, medical services, mental health, temporary long term shelter, residential programs staff, jobs/school programs. full capable people go rut hard get it.

You can't hand keycard hotel room expect solid life fall place week two. seen eyes. people deserve help, worked whole life economy changed whatever stay ahead it. fought foreign soil flag, people got dealt cards life. Americans, people, deserve little help. People risk serious complications death get 95%. People less risk get whichever one available them. I'd take either long low risk side effects Absolutely disgusting. cannot believe happening I'm always bud. 28th

January 28th? theories yet discrepancy blood types? I’ve wondering since hearing it. Pray 4 China trolls sub given Tramadol. still majority lol. opiate? reading ""fires"" wanting mean something let go job? Designed Tesco point article get clicks contributing fear mongering covid campaign Wow. Also, group vaccinated, significantly easing restrictions. Masks stick around while, distancing, group represents 99% Covid deaths vaccinated, don’t see public standing draconian measures anymore. ""most"" patients, yes. ones we're concerned reinfection, though. CONSUMES! real especially it.

I'm sorry what?

I know trying bolster poster's feelings trying kind.

But again, what?

This comes across kind dismissive. 500k doses held reserve thanks letting know Honest question done research modeling actual IFR? OK, that's good know. two sources found real conclusive evidence vaccine actually stopping contacting spreading it. 

Made little worried.

Thanks! Ok wanna see low count gonna get lol. joking, wanna see low get 30 minutes. want 80 downvotes lol, 30 okay Woah took massive leap try grab straws. US pace vaccinate maybe two million, goal 20 million end December. Regardless bottleneck, doses occurring fixed rate. Wait couple weeks, takes little body build full immunity. Also probably feel like shit day two. go wild. new strains virus reminded terrible/great idea earlier pandemic. idea genetically engineer strain virus simultaneously spreads far quickly causes asymptomatic mild infection cases causes severe infection &lt;0.01% cases. Ofc, thought ""last ditch effort"" kind idea, like find vaccine whatsoever vaccine turned 10 years out.

I'm curious know new strains turn less fatal/severe first, same. information that? know new development, probably not. served 8yrs military &amp; 2 years Iraq. saw real triage is. doctors/nurses combat would go 40+ hours without. fuck nurses. fuck California soft boyz. don’t think that, lol. mean, ehh, really don’t think so. early thirties ready send hospital “have throw kitchen sink me.” Luckily elevated oxygen still around 94/95, lying 91, sometimes 90. thick first wave right outside nyc really bad hospitals inundated. keeping ER 80s (cO2), quarantined hotel room didn’t kill family. went hospital twice it. first started getting sick tested. Second pneumonia pain, wanted make sure didn’t blood clot. 

And thanks. intense experience. lost half hair! feel sad dr. think probably scared many different reasons valid concerns one way another. hospitals scary they’re full this. didn’t get medical attention used busy cases. lucky doctor watching like hawk. FaceTiming every single day personal phone. Checking 9 11pm night. hope wife gave best sex life deserves it, forever. 

This pandemic horrible every facet system. I’m sad everyone. going staff it? New strain covid rise year, would like end Covid-19, world peace, climate control, new Xbox

Jasmyne priorities straight a) 400 reinfected now. b) counting anybody possibly asymptomatic get tested first second time. c) 250 reinfected cohort 3 months (90 days) number cases approximately 78,000. d) 78,000, 7% would potentially able reinfected (5460). e) reinfected, need actually exposed virus again. f) those, 250 re-exposed reinfected reinfection rate 4.5% potentially reinfected. 

Those encouraging numbers perspective. wave increases, numbers get larger potential re-exposure increases. Would helpful volunteers observe? I'd happy go hospital watch people get shot 15 minutes yell help allergic reaction get giving next person shot. Probably happens second dose.

Then all, ""Execute order 66""!! studies say virus stay viable 20 min hands. Many eons ago, got sick Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving big deal family. 7 8.

I spent Thanksgiving home alone ill. Yeah little kid. really sucked. Mostly spend Grandma.

I'm sorry going right now.

I feel you. Source? mine? your? speaking like think im american share “formula” manufacturers several companies cranking vaccine? people campaigning minorities top tha vaccination priority list ""social justice"". even dude? Yes anyone get virus, chances significantly slimmer healthy active person. majority time, **nobody hears it**.

FTFY.

Just spent past months watching 5 month old niece get MRSA pneumonia hospital. bacteria heart, doctors advised brother anything affect her, spread body, died end November months struggling. Two doctors case, surgeon neonatal specialist, kept giving brother conflicting information care never seemingly communicated plan action. brother currently suing malpractice since state he's one-party consent state doctors multiple recordings giving completely opposite information care. 

It's fucking heartbreaking watching shit happen can't even support person covid 3,000 miles distance us. article says 50% white medical worker act like that... isnt racist generalization nothing is. Yeah, states different. California exploding now, Midwest going down. Where's freakin' ~~gabagool~~ vaccines? + testing time? dreaming *only thing* wearing mask. Loll. Sorry help laugh. messed imagining stupid movie (one of) sad, enraging thing(s) NEWS. taught disparity school failed move needle it. generalizations.

A racist generalization would - ""white people like country music"" 

If scientific study 20 years data indicated white people indeed like country music, would cease racist generalization.

That article seems demonstrate - decades data analysis indicates racial bias white doctors influences treatment black patients.

I want perfectly clear - someone making unsubstantiated claim white doctors treat black patients. would racist.

What article suggests decades data - clear undeniable pattern emerges subject whims subjective opinions poll - indicates clear pattern leads black people mistreated white doctors race. 

There way cut it. 

If upsets makes angry - good! should.

If upsets makes angry someone taken time gather data, analyze reveal findings - must ask upsets you.

It's different upset someone investigates water finds wet. would silly upset study findings implies emotional response instead tied desire avoid truth - water indeed wet. actually thought aspects clinical trials better. example phase 3 placebo group Pfizer Moderna given saline meant participants knew sore arm didn't.

Oxford AZ gave alternative vaccine placebo stayed true double blind. fun begins! I'm agnostic, agree seemed real missed opportunity. remember reading 10 plagues, passover, etc. seems ready made for, sign God... Stay Fkkk home. awful.  

rest peace. Obviously already know microchip read title first ""fortnite"" spread confused af inflation fetish. pumps cells full RNA til explodes releases itself.  think need look closer home blame game. ive done bunch reading questions answered, still outstanding...i saying way discussed mainstream media seem likely convince people skeptical take it. saying ""its safe"" showing bunch politicians taking tv seems like waste time. dont think basic concept works difficult, would nice see open somewhat technical discussion potential long term side effects, moment seems like would treated great sin even bring possibility long term side effects, even within context explaining likely wont any. 

im disagreeing scientists, im disagreeing way mainstream media chooses discuss issue. True enough. We've trained argue instead discuss. Also exists:  
A black medical doctor UK decided write handbook diagnose skin-related conditions POC especially blacks neither taught anything similar medical students learn regarding black skin degree program. education

And that's realize can't offer educated opinion stop commenting. supermarkets said plenty stock. cause shortages hoarders usually go apeshit come Christmas anyway. 2 person household never need entire shopping trolley food christmas. insane. shelves empty today, go walk boxing day/27th see house green bin chock full uneaten food that's problem right :( Strange conviction buy Microsoft shares... rollercoaster Uh no....

Your example operational change, geographic. biological structural change directly impacts. 

Not good metaphor black people really blame everything color skin Yes.

At least, reading, even getting first shot significantly reduces severity covid symptoms. many high risk people getting initial doses mean difference life death. taught med schools nursing schools . rising violent crime area also. flu shot last year hurt lot 2 1/2 days. year got (in armor) hurt much. Weird. think remove size church leave scummy behavior = lack caring. I'm doubtful originating too. somebody lives Kent lowest figures UK back September area hitting bottom table October. Obviously virus mutate point seem rather improbable happened one least infected parts country. Add fact we're gateway Europe channel tunnel dropping people straight area could say there's fair chance imported.

Also seemed November UK wide lockdown apply Kent roads every bit busy normal throughout may minor contributing factor spreading fast south east. Sadly, socioeconomic status education doesn’t play role this. It’s largely race. Serena Williams almost died childbirth doctors didn’t believe pain/having pulmonary embolism she’s prone blood clots. studies this. fact, one reason opioid crisis didn’t really affect black people doctors never prescribed black people pain meds think lot learn taking look numbers. also common practice belief women general complain lower level pain men do, therefore woman screaming agony, (in multiple verified circumstances) held “being hysterical”. trying women color explaining pain? Good luck. Even money Mexican vaccination program runs smoother faster, per capita, US version. don’t think personal (unless bias military veterans/families) - none ever met me. issue asked direct questions help understand problem. met roadblock many people would stopped - many people would ability (or time) find direct email CEO within large organization like UCLA Health. even three-way call insurance plan credentialing UCLA. 

My wife works healthcare doctor, many years pharmacy auditor reviewing insurance claims behalf insurance plans (checking BOP regulations compliances). household good grasp insurance billing. 

How questioned post - sort way tried resolve situation. comments made UCLA staff continuously, appeared regurgitated person person. went several levels chain command (and departments)- continuously told “the contract renewed” excuses, never contract ... open access plan. previous year wasn’t problem billing - really tried get bottom issue trying help see themselves. didn’t appear critical thinking utilized UCLA Health employees. 

Your last sentence shows biases generalizations. mechanics changed careers, another close connect insurance billing. black man, people sometimes appear underestimate knowledge capabilities appearance .... assessment - get kick showing wrong! I’ve justify worth knowledge whole life - advocate close doesn’t cause stress. 

I go VA hospital staff doesn’t always follow basic protocols/standard - job stop laziness don’t harm Vietnam (or older) vet. hope younger veteran I’m frail. want people treated fairly.

You need better impression automotive mechanics too. Lol see comment like others thread, gotta give account scroll waste energy responding. damien00012 account real treat It’s related skin color personally. Read op also staying home holidays. crazy, you’re making safe, socially responsible choice.

No offense family, I’ve never met assume nice people. selfish putting others risk. 

So many people going close eyes pretend bodies somehow won’t partake spread deadly virus. It’s really sad people can’t even give single Christmas help protect people communities. definitely don’t doubt racist

But hasn’t “not giving pain medicine physical proof” forced doctors heads combat opioid crisis?

And it’s messed let go they’re probably already way capacity gonna make anybody leave, patient also doctor, kind seem logical since identify symptoms better others

The doctor taking care might racist, idk, wasn’t there. far 2 things, kind makes sense would way, it’s still shitty, seems like best way handle pisses off. people go work (customer contact jobs, manufacturing on), everyone else encouraged WFH reducing overall risk. WFH need mandatory lower risk period, point since February zero risk. Give clubs, bars, concert venues ability enforce verify vaccinations you’ll like 90% compliance among young people like 2 months. Hell LA hotspot, let vaccinated people attend Lakers games cheap whole city begging take vaccine. 1/4 coworkers (geriatric) getting round, it’s honestly frustrating distrust science much that’s America 🇺🇸 people keep going fantasy Covid deaths happening elderly people would die soon anyway, it’s peaceful passing hospice?

Middle aged people dying. Teenagers dying. Children dying. People still long lives ahead them.

/And that’s die./
 Franklin Veaux put it:

“What people survive?

For every one person dies:

19 require hospitalization.
18 permanent heart damage rest lives.
10 permanent lung damage.
3 strokes.
2 neurological damage leads chronic weakness loss coordination.
2 neurological damage leads loss cognitive function.
So sudden, “but it’s 1% fatal!” becomes:

3,282,000 people dead.
62,358,000 hospitalized.
59,076,000 people permanent heart damage.
32,820,000 people permanent lung damage.
9,846,000 people strokes.
6,564,000 people muscle weakness.
6,564,000 people loss cognitive function.”

This exact opposite Numbers rose throughout lockdown, numbers went dropped, time countries lockdown. 

You confusing maybe. lies transparent anyone reading.

France went light lockdown less 2 months ago. time daily new infections dropped 70%-80% peak. period, Sweden experiencing either growth daily figures effective plateau equivalent rate Frances peak.

Haha holy shit priviledge comments life hard might you, reason, seem unwilling accept reality feel like fantasy world head way _factual_. might easier time little work critical thinking reading comprehension skills. Hmm pretty telling think hard life = claiming street smarts People depressed. Cost living mixed covid. Lots people dont see point living. What. pay bills forever? mean vaccine made research scientists German, Hungarian, Chinese American public universities? 

or mean development process financed German government European union? EU 2nd wave 100x US infection rate time leaders 100% fault every death Hilary killing Americans purpose? count trump dont like him. intent matters well personal responsibility citizens. government cant control every person people stupid. government slow purpose. could much better however slow time change course think things push elect like minded people majority. reddit thinks government needs involved person person level allowing business open providing trans hormone blockers 4 year olds free military trans people, free healthcare free college, free child support. simultaneously wants less police less military, abortion laws drug laws. borders, freedom speech, personal weapons. Many, many people definitely faking get time post office. Trust me, know. many Americans need vaccinate 6 months order gain proper “ herd immunity “?  Found another proud graduate School Hard Knocks.

Lemme guess... think street smarts, think matters, right? There’s giant hospital chain near live (in US). know lot upper management work since love neighborhood. received COVID vaccine I’m really confused how. say enough front line worker plus management (people don’t work hospital, like accounting). I’m sure got many vaccines. people voted Trump, called Covid hoax, went around life like pandemic laughed people like stayed home.

Now vaccine resume normal life ( stopped living normal life). I’m pretty peeved honestly Outsourcing Infosys (his wife daughter founder). ever gone wrong..... 1/328 0.3%. c guy guut like know normal. trying spread body positive message covid time that. Yep that's everyone agrees obv referring daily case count, shows downward trend month December 2020... might want check facts make inaccurate claims. average, virus picks one mutation every ten people infects. UK alone would made 200,000 announcements. Like say, mutations completely insignificant. significant announcements would get drowned noise announced every sinle one. two kinds Americans:

Those think America best country world...

And passports. especially horrible considering high rate death child birth even overall compared countries (55th world) horrifying Already hard life, struggled ever will. conclusion ass wrong imo. Nobody earth thinks norway world's best country, prob really usa That's part pisses ""nobody innovate there's profit"" argument. Like, bit company invents new drug makes butt ton money it, GETS FUCKING MONEY? FUCKING SCIENTISTS ENGINEERS ACTUALLY INVENTED I'LL TELL Good. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Holy cow. sick place. nightmare world you’ve decided live in. That's 3.8 million doses day rate. think going take much longer 2 months. God that's dumb. can't. one can. passports worthless Mexico.

LOL. touch, comebacks even post-Covid-aware. It’s anecdotal evidence healthcare workers, confirmed deadly dangerous Ah, thorough thoughtful rebuttal. 

Im always amazed encounter willfully ignorant, despite often happens. hard life ahead attitude wish best. Pee covid worked abroad 2-6 week shifts, year I've home almost entire year. nice spending time partner driving mad I'm used time away home. That's life always think I'm one routine homebodies, need personal time space away others year. Let’s use $250M pay people take vaccine. “You wanna go wine dine? Yes? Here’s $1500 make happen gotta get vaccinated first” Another poll straits times showed 80%. poll lowest seen Singapore. Original (deleted) comment Covid only. said agree relevant general. think funny quickly deleted comment though; 5 minutes. Good job said world wide Web Muppet

Completely different things Plenty Republican politicians got vaccinated first.

So elderly misanthrope, Rupert Murdoch, owner FOX News. I'm sure Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity Laura Ingraham right behind him. know US government printed money. can’t keep printing money like that, takes value dollar. print, less valuable dollar becomes. Next year going real fun world governments realize printed much money it’s 20% less valuable, even more.

Also, stimulus 900 billions, 80 million Americans get 600$, much total? 48 billions. rest doesn’t go people. politics politics. simply easy solution problem Yea, governments subsidized shit? think achieved public system? South Africa United Kingdom saw yesterday highest number covid deaths months (744 UK, highest since 1 May; 411 South Africa, highest since 5 August). double shocked – 64 hours course online licensing? getting licence nursing aide requires one year course combined school job training practical exam. running nursing facility half staff? attrition staff negligence residents. utmost respect helping residents survive. Stay well possible. Glad hear USA Canada countries world Europe doesn’t exist. It’s get people trust vaccine watch videos pharmacy school hospital worked at.

On trainings unit nurses bitching Mr Sanchez constantly complains ask pain medication post op. ""I wish like Mr Wong! Asians never complain!"". Fast forward 2 hours Mr Sanchez rushed back bleeding everywhere nurse pay believe him.

I personally know pharmacists use n word. 

And yes, physicians, nurses, HCPs human. biases. first step correcting recognize exist. point lol think Nope. currently approved vaccines produced Switzerland Belgium. issues forced labour there.

Lonza might opening another manufacturing site Singapore, also forced labour issues. imagine easier develop vaccine H1N1 virus overall similar influenzas? lived 6 months Switzerland. notorious bureaucracy.

The article seems related experience bureaucratic institutions. interesting see Inauguration Day handled. given shit treatment, coming conclusion race based hospitals overwhelmed bit ridiculous. It’s disgusting.

Young, poor citizens enticed military career, used, left psychological and/or physical trauma never recover from, power reap benefits leave almost nothing.

Have heard Wounded Warriors? run ads TV awfully similar SPCA ads Sarah McLachlan. Tell something, fuck charities military personnel budget big? I’m going overtly optimistic non healthcare starts getting vaccinated. Im american. use , . opposite do, Denmark. 500,000 would written 500.000 here. Switzerland's extremely high life expectancy birth pretty much shows terrible simple. people health reasons cant get vaccine. rely everyone else protection.  .. drink mercury? show studies? Herd immunity stupid thing heard. lot young people also long term/permanent damage. go to: I'm going give obviously non native speaker benefit doubt assume he's questioning results per se instead generalization made it, i.e. white healthcare workers racist know treat black patients system inherently corrupted white Americans cause evil world.

He attitude shows people confronted research like African Americans score x points lower average IQ tests African Americans x% likely criminal.

One group makes crazy generalizations like treat black people differently (I mean, county x state x might also score lower IQ cares), group denies could even true decided must racist. Friendly tip: reading certain subreddits make feel worse, try taking break see feel better. add this. Black people also likely diagnosed severe mental illness even presenting symptoms white person.... happened years doctors rarely communicated diagnosis kept changing overmedicating for. monitors specifically test scenario I'm surprised based I've seen heard people taking covid seriously. trust anyone. That's avoid flying airports publuc spaces much possible. never amaze people like would rather believe everything fine anyone speaks out, including physician, simply trying “increase hate”. increasing hate people speaking lived experiences? It’s truly exhausting read people brush everything real. Stuff like realized didn’t matter many degrees got, spoke, profession, would change people mindset. Nothing say people like say, matters people think like you. gonna Force vaccine innocent healthy people? Sounds like Nazi Germany me. Thanks great posts. wondering exact topic talking UK variant UK's frequency testing.

Thanks stay safe. Also dying covid prevents reinfection 100% time Actually no. phenomenon studied controlling socioeconomic factors black women still disproportionately die childbirth. Also black people general lower life expectancy (again, controlling socio economic factors) it’s socioeconomic status. Health care isnt terrible all. lack restrictions caused similar infection levels US. Health care world class. past week California jumped four five spots 36th US cases per million. there's another 40,000+ cases tomorrow could state two spots, surpassing New Jersey. guess that's exponential growth. Ugh, Indiana. Surprised burning crosses hospital lobby, hateful bastards. Hoard bottle caps first extremely interesting read. video Dr. Arkin taking work: shit. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Madness, takes toll. listen closely, much longer, Trump's got... lose control. Yes, especially considering doctor mentioning history claims hospital multiple claims discrimination; specifically pertains Black women. Sure, could delayed also introduced things. Years banging controlling borders nothing actually matters. really think need lecture one getting vaccinated current phase. They're either healthcare workers already trust science Facebook people really travelling far nursing home. Yeah, maybe politicians getting vaccines right might idiots it, they're probably reddit. TBF reason wrote upon time, guy. Young, smart, profoundly ignorant. one nearly good thing getting older knowing don’t know. decline 500 million doses, EU initially ordered 200 million instead 500 million, back July. ordering another 100 million doses. population 748 million, there's plenty time order since supply scarce. think could gotten doses sooner. Jesus, that's awful. I'm sorry.

I watched three close family members (children ex husband) go hell US medical system.

My ex misdiagnosed Lupus. Doctors immediately put massive dose steroids anything control control blood pressure utterly vicious temper (they warn awful side effects, internet back then). Two three years later finally addressed it, kidneys already compromised. put high dose diuretic none multiple docs communicated adjust potassium take. year waking excruciating leg cramps. Docs said ""It's nature disease."" 

He RA, Lupus. Hodgkin's long term steroid use. wonder he's even alive.

Still nothing approaching happened family, tiny, tiny fraction happened one family ridiculous 'healthcare' system. children come close dying - daughter medical condition clear obvious symptoms. pediatrician sent us away four times, saying flu (no fever, respiratory symptoms). guess nobody wants “disrespect” troops?

Look treat veterans. US *government* disrespects troops. somehow that's completely fine. works. Yes, starting fight virus, like fight boxing match, mRNA vaccines basically give immune system instructions destroy protein virus uses enter cells (really simplified) mutates protain, really really probable cannot enter cells ease anymore, basically loose loose situation virus. require formal declaration war. invoked ""at war risk war"". 
So would possibly invoke de facto war well. think lawyers would agree pandemic cannot called war legal sense. reputation ruined. people talk describe ""micro-aggressions."" mean ""dumb small thing thin skin can't handle."" means small act gesture racism cases reveals deeper instinct societal trend.  Uncle dad sister mom missed, along grampa cousin. least never forced wear mask, thank Jesus. really see connection taxes. taxes part comparatively low *because* pay health insurance pockets. biggest budget item rent.

It's lower middle class gets shafted oartly qualify subsidies therefore pay health care (in relation income).  Well either health minister fucking idiot saying he’s right, either way it’s concerning  get 0.457 person? Someone cut half waist down? had? “having” certainly insures can’t reinfected, least yet. right time attitude wins _no one_ side indeed infuriates people even more. Thanks sharing, super fucked important us know. Supposedly 90% (self proclaimed insiders Brazilian forums) vaccine makers afraid miscommunications different arms trial comes back varying numbers.  gotta love Dunning-Krueger effect full display Rapid important screening though. infections get better nothing. PCR slow useful context. Yeah... I'm hoping vaccinations start rolling everything somehow go back normal. thing think COVID messing everyone's feelings.

Believe me, lots stuff need agree hope get married one day. Thank helping vent ahaha Oh ffs....I hate anti maskers. fuckers worst. Russia declared war neither Georgia Ukraine. Source ""dude trust me"" quite normal medicine, example lot antibiotics used tested Israelis one biggest pharma development sites based 80's / 90's, we're finding antibiotics like hydroquinones fine Asians, Africans people Middle East serious fatal side effects even tiny doses white people native Northern Europe. unpopular opinion here, think should/should've focused protecting elderly unhealthy locking everyone down. Healthy young people virtually zero chance dying sequester themselves. low risk means get vaccines last, low risk also let engage activities. economic point view (most earners learners 50) mental health point view also. Yesterday people føtex wearing anti mask badges 😅😅😅 insinuation 100% false. 

People 45 fact directly died Covid. fact. real tragedy fuck lady extremely racist 3 500.000. days might 3, days could be188.457 number range. constitution requires actual war martial law, yes. pretty clear point. government literally power invoke martial law. look celebrities role models; say admire way behaves. Oooh. SarcoIdosis. That's game changer. Significantly less number tests done though Utah source. Cost living wealth influx disenfranchises people wonder crime rate goes ""nice"" place. Donald Trump built little golden hotel home told leave I'd sure come back rob place. flip side, people support denying care anti-maskers anti-vaxxers. expertise 

Doctors expertise are. tell GP want trippy, visual, mellow high minimal drowsiiness they're going know give you. That's mutilation opinion. least real doctors know, babies feel pain. get feel single comment...Is wrong think way since truly love partner?

It's difficult. Here’s do:

1. STFU
2. Educate yourself

None new, settled science. first part, already know, know fuck all. pipe listen people do. Based headline, get vote for. 

Im strapping 2021..... would medical trainees get idea black people thicker skin less sensitive nerve endings? Yes actually, first batch H1N1 caused narcolepsy sizeable portion people. healthy adult wait high risk people get vaccine first, chances getting side effects tiny comparison chance dying COVID. Oh fuck deliberately exposing people COVID. Yup. tendon surgery St Pete's Olympia, WA.Dog bite. Tenosynovitis.
But case pain direction. wanted go home. insisted would need pain meds. Everything gave sent heart rate up. 
My arm still numb kept slapping face it. insisted need pain meds finally let go home. fine ibuprofen.
Everyone different pain threshold. 
I seen people must unimaginable pain ER. focused skin color. make videos.
I sorry died. think perhaps care pandemic bit less usually is.
Staff stressed working much.
My husband set homecare since spring. never planned able get hospital bed going go alone home get covid. VA provides health insurance (CHAMPVA) spouses children certain veterans. insurance completely different health benefit I, veteran, get VA. 
CHAMPVA similar Tricare Medicare. 

That problem racism .... showing proof hardest thing - use another excuse actions .... sorta like man say “a woman deserved raped dressed.”

Also, don’t know people thinking moment - rarely characterize racist. use term “bias” - biases I’m trying convince person never experience anything close - I’m feeling. 

For time, people hid racism - caught blame substance abuse, mental illness. article black women facing higher risks white women female POC general.

Secondly, mainly issue poor therefore getting good medical care compared wealthy people? 

From article:
""All told, African-American women probably entering pregnancy less healthy women,"" said.""

This also probably related poverty black people suffer lot people backgrounds shame see article racist medical staff racist structures hospitals play role here? Yeah, you’re right.

I think it’s stupid amount military spending goes country even social radar far movements goes.

I guess nobody wants “disrespect” troops? got virus, always it. Covid-19 similar AIDS/HIV. Thats called ""vaccine"" useless. But....according libs libertarians Swiss healthcare best world due low taxes!

I mean wish bad things Switzerland, feels great myths capitalist superior nation low taxes dying out. Turns low taxes save burecracy bad healthcare system. expectations....well know... everything heard; Canada way better. miss something? beyond obvious now. say most, large population is. Surprisingly avoided top restrictions year Im worried waiting turn.... *eye roll* Sweden invoke martial law war serious threat war. way declaring state emergency peacetime, least without changing constitution (which would possible 2022 case). 
 
Well, case noticed whole world war epidemic. new war front opened Antarctica. 
Does really Estonia declaring war Sweden Sweden initiate measures epidemic? 
 government completely tied legislation, create new laws shut parts society extent. Look temporary law Spring example, new coming pandemic law. government power would country attacked Russia. 
 
Just it. Sweden almost 12 months take appropriate measures - far looking good. worried. Stay Home. Act like March. Dont fool. Kill one person, murder.

Kill 20,000. mistake brah food good? Lol True, purely stimulus package though. $600 may seen stimulus, PPP unemployment social safety net.

Don't even want comment rest. know million important people US even laundering, that's illegal. successfully convinced American public spending 740 Billion year military essential. get *legally* pump money bank accounts. true. mentally ill. Scientists, doctors, engineers, logicians, technicians, etc. takes deriving chemical formula make vaccine. There’s testing, supply chains manufacturing distribution testing lots forth. I’m saying aren’t issues drug companies, denying contributions instance disingenuous. lol replies insane that’s pretty safe! Huh? world hate 'big Pharma', that's pretty American thing due awful healthcare insurance companies. I've using Walmart curbside months. Amazon Prime I'd probably eating oatmeal eggs. I'm lucky enough chickens get fresh eggs. Every white peoples raise diferently, hear racist generelazing make mad, half white peoples like that, 3/4 black like this, GTFO racist BS. Singapore still lots measures place despite local cases days. Travel restrictions, quarantine, contact tracing, group size restrictions, etc still effect enforced. I’m probably last round given age prior health conditions related COVID. I’ll gladly wait turn risk get there’s first. Cheers you!!! corroborating pointlessness UK travel ban... so?

Don’t twist words suit rhetoric please, it’s unbecoming.  There's research sime polling surveys. . . . I'm embarrassed know that. Cool, statement literally one 45 died COVID still 100% false. lot interesting think. Majority life earth dependent oxigen, fast way process energy huge evolutionary advantage. deathly stuff bodies, literally rust bodies, reason get cancer. Oxigen dependent organisms active, energy, grow faster also die, oxigen compounds unstable, best worst life autism yet? Chris Rock standup special. Trumps Vaccine going save us. implying entire team scientists see results showing vaccine might ineffective wave say nothing? none conscience speak even government lies? surge happening,...

What? seen doward trend Utah since December 1, 2020? Measures take weeks make impact. Earlier implementation measures result smaller earlier peaks. places US, including California, implement measures fast enough. Dispatch Center first line? office job? see patients. people corporations shut making money dead yet? dont reply assume dead wont get That's still enough vaccinate everyone ~75 first responders hospital staff.

That's enough drop fatality rate ICU rate almost nothing.

And that's 3 months away! make proteins thank much, though never seem mutate...

Entirely new? studied years invented 90s. Scientists using completely new. 

It's fine skeptical probably frustrating scientists people bother understand issue depth(outside catchy headlines/CNN articles) still wanna contradict top scientists world. Oh god more.

Approximately $1.5 Trillion. notice starts make difference them.

If all. 70 million wont take muh freedum fuck least four SARS-CoV vaccine candidates showed hypersensitivity ADE upon rechallenge animal models driven Th2 responses. Spike S.

Because people liars cheats. None states Chicago, hence Illinois double population compared Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri quadruple Iowa. Also significantly higher population density. listen experts. experts listen say FDA never approve levels ivermectin used countries it’s extremely toxic.  say studies poorly done.

Glad lived see light yourself. part project work I'm less concerned asymptomatic cases far reinfection goes patients going die. But, kind side project disagree Ioannidis study done way early pandemic lasting, meaningful results. 0.67-1.24 current range increasing US, antibody tests really garbage hard put together decent data set, especially considering false positive rates antibody titers drop off. quick... It'll take decade immunise everyone speed Well, that's cool. keep pace, 3m/mo, need 100 months. Ugh. Yes they're still run ground.. Powers need wake up. MRNA vaccines Prettt sure first BioNTech doses produced Pfizer Belgium shipped US. sitting 0.78% vaccination rate. lying, didn’t say weren’t gonna lie. work, who's holding bag? like, oh they're afraid workers yeah okay. bunch asymptomatic cases make difference looking efficacy that's saying 90% effective

It make difference pose question limited way. would really like know vaccines prevent people spreading disease stop symptoms forming. prevents symptoms result herd immunity virus still spread 5% us effectively vaccinated, still over.

I tend think stop (or greatly reduce) spread. also tend think protection starts earlier studies claim cold chain requirements overstated, also reliably tested we're going assume true. one possible SARS vaccines, triggered specific spike protein (m?), hypersensitivity ADE? thought ones targeted protein (s?) really many negative effects get developed time. person knew consequences still decided go ahead anyways ... Maybe option couple considered .. again! HIV person cant become super spreader... many groups advise allocation prioritization. One big ones US ACIP. group made experts field. decisions based scientific data ethics. recommendations implemented state governments. several states know leaving COVID decisions epidemiologists physicians. However, others leaning political scientific. Yeah even get clicks without alarmist headlines?!? mean still makes zero sense me... lol. Like political conspiracies ppl believe ridiculous like get cause power power. ppl gain stopping ppl getting vaccinated?! 🤯 Well, hoping also. also seen confirmed reinfections ( also one them. March, november). 

We also patient October, treated patient, 2 negative PCRs sent home. 
Came back week ago symptoms, pcr positive, although high CT- value ( 35). 

Reinfections definetly possible, know exactly immunity works long. remember didn’t get rid pain knocked out. Lol. Wow! That’s crazy. call local hospital ask need volunteers recommend way going it? Cool get American quotes here? Idk countries, Americans name here. move consider American, youre american... nation immigrants one... early data suggest Moderna vaccine might protect vaccinated people asymptomatic infections well symptomatic disease. it’s clear vaccine, along Pfizer’s, prevents people developing COVID-19 symptoms, stopping infections entirely crucial curb coronavirus’ spread build immunity communities. 14,000 people received placebo, 38 tested positive coronavirus — without showing symptoms — first injection second. 14 received Moderna vaccine, however, asymptomatic carriers virus people tested second dose, company reported. two-third reduction COVID-19 cases without symptoms vaccine arm trial compared placebo group hints infections could prevented, even single vaccine Pfizer hasn’t yet released data showing whether vaccine prevents asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. works much like Moderna’s does, “I don’t think there’s reason believe difference two,” Naggie I'm teacher seoul many young students sharing they're going grandparents cousins, etc, christmas guessing cases gonna rise january. Sure vaccine free, costs

What costs? Please spread fake news vaccines. Yeah understand saying try limit read believe media.
That said, rising number cases deaths something can’t ignore even though don’t even live America.
I’m also shocked appalled governments lack leadership pandemic sometimes feel like I’m watching South Park episode it’s actually real life america. read actual medical science shows 400% increase deaths vitamins deficiency? Stop making every goddamn thing politics jackhole. visit couple done Thanksgiving Christmas years, live mile half away. adding 2 leaves table distance us them, opening several windows air circulates.

That serving Covid-19? We're turning down! definitely. need volunteer post vaccine observers. We’ve several minor allergic reactions facility. One ended trying hide rash leave without treatment. patient ended spending 6 hours ED progressing minor tongue swelling. Need observers make sure patients don’t leave full blown anaphylaxis leaving facility. see say ok bud. I’m sure point. never said majority people would vaccinated next month. said people sub minds thinking still masked/locked down/distancing 2022. Eh, Tramadol pretty low scale possible painkillers get hospital. closer ibuprofen fentanyl. Tramadol still effective, especially take painkillers regularly, comparatively intense. roof head, food, healthcare, enough money cover basic expenses (phone, shoes, clothes, etc) makes huge fucking difference. 90%, makes infertile, half people polled said take it. Excellent news. confirmed covid positive, back vaccine line! Although half people polled said take links seems everyone reddit knows somebody twice year. 

I know anyone even once. Y'all need keep better company. Well yes also India's cases dropping steadily since September Ok, masturbating actual argument that's going help counter ?

It's annoying source That’s amazing

It's good start. needs ramp 10x more. good 30 days dry ice, 5 regular fridge, absolutely reason vaccines sitting 35 days start distribution. Ah, honestly, vulnerable vaccinated, currently getting vaccinated, things calm considerably I'm like terribly worried that. weeks okay.

Okay, actually, bear mind I'm talking Canadian perspective apparently 70% deaths long term care homes. I'm assuming much different US, though. Look shitwit real number 0.2 - 9.7%, according page. again, lying. prob...glad helped. saying new probably important mutation top strain already original mutation predominates everywhere transmissible. actually quite lot mutations that, likely ones matter. mutations neutral. D614G definitely isn't, N501Y proven yet since showing apparently independently likely also something. number amino acid position, letter left original amino acid letter code (D = aspartate, N = asparagine), letter right new amino acid coded nucleic acid mutation (G = glycine, = tyrosine).

Couples used lots independent time probably find really difficult adjust to. see problems might happen. He's hoping find job allow continue work home indefinitely.  Oh shit, thanks Yeah that’s problem. Racist pricks know New York Daily News pimped article long vaccine became available knowing would one last death vaccine given medical people. people cry gnash teeth, even though dolt would know would one last death.  Yeah would someone mild symptoms go hospital? They’d sent home. Ya hopeful realistic. many people think J&amp;J coming early January late Feb early March realistic LET'S GO SCIENCE!

Looking new cases charts shows trends lot cyclical people talk here. don’t know, I’d love head bashed in. 100% covid deaths people 45 (about 45/14500) one co morbidity factors meaning literally one 45 died directly COVID.

1000% false statement gross misunderstanding comorbidities are. Mine barely sore , others getting woken first night.tbh, even notice arm sore till mentioned arms laughably childish conspiracy theory. sounds like something mind five year old. 1% open distributed people initiating vaccination (1st dose received) Moderna Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. right. 20% high, focusing fever numbers, real number 9.7%, experienced sever adverse reactions. Taken directly top page vast majority people get Covid rarely experience anything mild flu like symptoms. I’m sure people told getting Covid like, unless you’re 60 ain’t bad. I’m sure you’re fun worrying semantics describe dynamics Senate GOP caucus, topic hand covid relief giving agency party worked it.

Agreed. started Europe October, north US, northern US November, we're seeing play southern half US December. whole sub freaking thanksgiving surge going destroy everything - I'm certain many needless deaths cases caused thanksgiving gatherings, month thanksgiving cases decreased half states since (the states mostly got hit hard Nov), shows seasonality cyclical nature. places increasing lot December start see drops January. exactly rocket surgery, write instructions clearly enough bet 99% people could pinch.

Thanks! Hopefully approved end February... Fingers crossed!! 🤞 debunked it. Used common sense. I'm sorry-- told going back normal sooner that? close relative mine pharmaceutical executive told back April. common knowledge within industry rollout thing going run mid next year get large portion population vaccinated. driven throughput limits number vaccines produced using existing infrastructure, well timeline took get EUA. Anyone even moment suggested community spread began across states thing could remedied end year deliberately misleading you. may hand read would vaccine end year-- true, do. never realistic believe every American would received one sooner end Q1 2021, even stretch given above. 

Who think lockdown? far tell, large parts country fact *not* locked down. Nobody generally stopping engaging risky activities, primarily mixing households. places, businesses open limits. live state southeast basically restrictions businesses operate right now. measures basically suggestions around safety precautions-- that's it. emulates states right now. say: joining told can't work still.

in large part nobody telling people can't come work, least live, would imagine states few/no restrictions. work businesses going under. thought going under? pandemic getting worse, *people choosing patronize high risk venues*. knew answer, took moment look answer.

I’m black former military medic, things said family members scary - didn’t healthcare knowledge ... healthcare staff could successfully gaslight us. 

I email CEO UCLA Health seven employees kept telling daughter’s insurance plan wasn’t covered. Department Veterans Affairs provides health insurance family - open access plan (meaning long willing bill insurance get paid). kept getting stonewalled rank file UCLA staff - even black employee came line calm reassure “new contract”. None really knew - sent email CEO, UCLA Health VPs, Secretary Veteran’s Affairs (because UCLA Doctor used VA hospital teaching hospital). 

I spent 7-8 hours calmly explaining situation UCLA staffers course 10 days. went nuclear route UCLA Health follow ups occur delays continued. 

The UCLA CEO sent direct email reply (within 16 hours) issue corrected someone calling schedule appt. able get daughter evaluated later afternoon.

I show really up. Lord knows many people fallen incompetence. 

FYI - got follow White House response team (sorta worthless IMO) two weeks later. UCLA employee mainly handling case never apologized holdup.

I used healthcare background/ regulatory compliance knowledge showcase problem. tried tell health professionals wrong- didn’t believe me. sent emails executives - people gave fair treatment asking for. Half Americans obese though  Lol 😂 think time goes people see nothing bad happens, time gets general population people ready take it.

Question level air contamination severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) different hospital areas, factors associated contamination?

&amp;#x200B;

Findings systematic review 24 studies, 17% air sampled close patient environments positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA, viability virus found 9% cultures.

&amp;#x200B;

Meaning study, air close distant patients coronavirus disease 2019 frequently contaminated SARS-CoV-2 RNA; however, samples contained viable viruses.

&amp;#x200B;

Abstract

Importance Controversy remains regarding transmission routes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

&amp;#x200B;

Objective review current evidence air contamination SARS-CoV-2 hospital settings factors associated contamination, including viral load particle size.

&amp;#x200B;

Evidence Review MEDLINE, Embase, Web Science databases systematically queried original English-language articles detailing SARS-CoV-2 air contamination hospital settings January 1 October 27, 2020. study conducted accordance Preferred Reporting Items Systematic Reviews Meta-Analyses extension Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. positivity rate SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA culture described compared according setting, clinical context, air ventilation system, distance patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations copies per meter cubed air pooled, distribution described hospital areas. Particle sizes SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations copies median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per meter cubed analyzed categorization less 1 μm, 1 4 μm, greater 4 μm.

&amp;#x200B;

Findings Among 2284 records identified, 24 cross-sectional observational studies included review. Overall, 82 471 air samples (17.4%) close patient environments positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA, significantly higher positivity rate intensive care unit settings (intensive care unit, 27 107 \[25.2%\] vs non–intensive care unit, 39 364 \[10.7%\]; P &lt; .001). difference according distance patients (≤1 m, 3 118 \[2.5%\] vs m, 13 236 \[5.5%\]; P = .22). positivity rate 5 21 air samples (23.8%) toilets, 20 242 (8.3%) clinical areas, 15 122 (12.3%) staff areas, 14 42 (33.3%) public areas. total 81 viral cultures performed across 5 studies, 7 (8.6%) 2 studies positive, close patient environments. median (interquartile range) SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations varied 1.0 × 103 copies/m3 (0.4 × 103 3.1 × 103 copies/m3) clinical areas 9.7 × 103 copies/m3 (5.1 × 103 14.3 × 103 copies/m3) air toilets bathrooms. Protective equipment removal patient rooms high concentrations per titer SARS-CoV-2 (varying 0.9 × 103 40 × 103 copies/m3 3.8 × 103 7.2 × 103 TCID50/m3), aerosol size distributions showed peaks region particle size less 1 μm; staff offices peaks region particle size greater 4 μm.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusions Relevance systematic review, air close distant patients coronavirus disease 2019 frequently contaminated SARS-CoV-2 RNA; however, samples contained viable viruses. High viral loads found toilets bathrooms, staff areas, public hallways suggest areas carefully considered.  Meanwhile, company can't find factory workers. bumped hourly dollars added $1,000.00 signing bonus (and dropped drug testing, ha ha). takers. I'd want work factory job either we've never trouble finding employees now. feel like whole year medical science roller coaster gonna take least decade sort through, we're safe COVID mess. thought doesn’t stop spread, lessens symptoms? google fomite means yup, HVAC fomite.

Anyways, outside temperature low absolute humidity lower means inside air heated outside air relatively dry. Airborne viruses like dry air.

Same safety measures help slowing spread. Wash/desinfect hands, maintain distance wear mask. We've winter weather two months already disease gone wild, yet. Knock knock. No, still mutates half fast. We’ve never many hosts though. need vaccine. Please send asap. Im rich either, otherwise Id vaccine now. Race hustling part journalism now, especially nyt. Nyt even argued vaccine distribution based ""equity"" instead age groups using age groups lead older whiter population . get 3am work, boyfriend makes hours usually sleeps till 9am. light sleepers crabby first cup coffee. back problems need different mattresses, likes room cold like warm, sleep fan running hate air blowing me, sleep better TV drives bonkers. like dogs bed me, refuses sleep animals. snore. shared bedroom would probably crime scene. Well damn.  I'm going ""95%"" effective rate stated Manuf....  Don't. America spent every waking second post WWII ""counting blessings"" realizing much better parts third world. made us complicit ever growing pile shit living busy resting laurels, america shit show today.

Don't count blessings. Get due. Healthcare understood it. called - leaders always pieces shit. It’s easy too. Black woman comes complaining something, doesn’t matter what. Nurse checks blood pressure part intake sees it’s high. doesn’t say anything well, African Americans frequently high blood pressure. Doctor misses too, sees it, maybe tells get down, meds diet talk maybe lose weight. doesn’t ask questions doctor talks like know stuff, doesn’t get referral dietician “she’s black black people eat crap anyway”. 

The patients keeps issues goes doctor years. one talks blood pressure. starts taking Motrin regular she’s getting headaches lot gets talked ulcers. loses weight doesn’t feel well stomach hurts anyhow. vision blurry gets reading glasses. Maybe sees eye doctor tells high blood pressure cause there’s follow education. 

She finally gets super sick ends hospital tell kidney failure unmanaged high blood pressure. lot small decisions took there. 

Maybe someone brushed black, follow questions missed. Maybe prescribed medication one point stopped taking (too expensive, enough time see doctor again, didn’t understand forever). welcome people like paying income. Yeah stayed open like Florida cases going bad. True, that’s going big hurdle there. “We can’t know certain.” You’re using terminology police use black people try pain accusatory guilty manner.

The reality is, nothing article suggests, even remotely, race anything whatsoever. Especially considering exact story situation shared 10’s thousands people across country, overlooked care due completely overloaded patients due global pandemic. see read news like this, read news passing COVID relief bill really doesnt provide relief Americans, get angry country run Americans 
who dont give shit Americans.

Says quite lot... Oh boy, thinking behind that? They're going get bad press, one going take it. Happy 420 guess Wahhhhh wear mask wahhhhhhh Merry Christmas Eve. 

### Summary

**What already known topic?**

On December 1, Advisory Committee Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended health care personnel long-term care facility residents offered COVID-19 vaccination first (Phase 1a).

**What added report?**

On December 20, ACIP updated interim vaccine allocation recommendations. Phase 1b, COVID-19 vaccine offered persons aged ≥75 years non–health care frontline essential workers, Phase 1c, persons aged 65–74 years, persons aged 16–64 years high-risk medical conditions, essential workers included Phase 1b.

**What implications public health practice?**

Federal, state, local jurisdictions use guidance COVID-19 vaccination program planning implementation. TIL Spaghetti taste Coronaebola Reply thanksgiving comment clear simple. possible vaccine ""works"" 99+% people immunity black white. possible exposure differences location exposure causing people vaccinated get sick. 

Like, person vaccinated another virus weakens immune system hit large dose covid, get infected. normal health exposed normal amount covid would become infected. Man need get vaccinated ASAP....This shit getting frenzy hospitalized patients. It’s new news work given early. mean, obviously. Otherwise left would give ""my body, choice."" mean, thats nice all, doesnt even qualify drop ocean compared needed long term. hope US govt comes party sooner later exactly think vaccines work? Crazy misleading titled. “Get vaccine savvy help end lockdowns getting vaccinated.” We're saving humanity, we're trying develop medicines treat serious disease. Like scientific endeavors, great number dependencies industry academia government labs. works splendidly, entity providing great contributions towards end goal. need denigrate part IMO.

Scientists pharma US well-compensated, intense competition talent. want hire scientists trained world's top universities, need pay. Honestly, nearly two decades working pharma R&amp;D, I've never heard colleague talk salary relation CEO's salary. especially germane comparison - CEO exceedingly difficult job us would want could successfully.

I work publicly traded firm, shareholders (self included) reap profits form dividends capital appreciation, ""boss"". industry profitable, middle road terms net profit margin (less profitable banking, tobacco, semiconductors, financial services, software, etc.) accurate health screenings result missed life saving interventions (preventing stroke / proper medication management). 

They changing cuffs using reading non-thigh cuff thigh cuff wrong. Make sure properly. 

I honestly don’t know situation, ask health staff can’t measure proper cuff size arm start machine. Using wrong cuff isn’t quite RACIST, you’re getting proper consistent BP assessment. US, it’ll like cards dental hygienist gives next six-month appt written in. purpose remind vaccine got, get booster (that varies depending get). 

It’s meant serve proof you’ve vaccinated, although countries talking making things like access public transportation contingent vaccination status, they’ll need come something permanent less easy counterfeit. sounds like one doctor particular dickhead. unpopular, delusional.

In Germany, 1/3 hospitalized 60. That's shut recently. Perfect protection elderly would given us days, more.

An FFP-2 mask prevents something like 90-98% particles emitted. Let's assume that's proportional amount virus, let's settle realistic 90% fitting issues. Hospitals Germany still reusing them, still rare, world production still can't keep up.

It's estimated something like 10 10^3 infectious doses per minute emitted someone first phase disease, still looking 10 100 times infection exhaled per minute FFP-2.

Now imagine caretaker helping people brushing teeth changing clothes small private room care home 100 times day, doctor diagnosing someone close distance.

What think happen?

Also, one put patients hospitals, mostly elderly? two patients per room.

And rapid tests: Germany trying source big money, likely enough spring. shows strange priorities people - worry occasional Big Mac might lower life expectancy tiny bit maybe lead shorter life clogged arteries decade two completely ignore epidemic 1% chance killing **now**. Slow af CECC fines EVA keeping house order. I’m early thirties. severe pneumonia. took five months get back normal. Hope you’re back soon! I’m doctor. abundant proof racism profession affects people. 

There’s recent issue British Medical Journal (one Big Four medical journals) British perspective: 

[I think it’s here. New Zealand genomic sequencing used boost effectiveness contact tracing. almost certain cases coming single cluster. 

In terms identifying mutation much less likely mutation occur due lower case numbers, much likely pick up. Though less likely able study effect has. Yeah, seems like stretch might possible. Kinda like second-hand smoke, strong mean 100% harmless. Ok I’ll listen you. I’m sorry go contributed exhaustion. Yeah. chopped 7"" April, kinda uneven. Viruses evolve way kill host. infectious necessarily mean deadly. Think it. host virus dies.

A good example cold virus. ancient ancestors nearly wiped several times cold virus various forms evolved. Look easy catch cold isnt generally fatal. What's point knowing strains change public policy? 

Knowledge knowledge sake great anything knowledge valuable.

So props Denmark identifying taking action (sad see animals culled greater good) props UK done locking well. 

America lot cases, barely sequencing done percentage wise way change public policy based sequencing. 6:30 pm yesterday, 1.12 million people recorded received first vaccine shots U.S total 2.7 million people  ""It hurts this""

""Then take break it.""

GENIUS! haircut get...I’ve cutting own. Thankfully White black colours shades genius don’t know made logical jump Potentially higher new dosages, though.

Unlikely since group younger, likely respond well vaccines. last comment Andrew Yang joke  think u/neotonne really saying modification Newton's quote; little spin.

*"" “If seen further,” Isaac Newton wrote 1675 letter fellow scientist Robert Hooke, “it standing shoulders giants.” ... Standing shoulders giants necessary part creativity, innovation, development. make less valuable. ""*

Basically little happens today could done without work done us, early work done government coffers. joke, learn take one term, then, would use describe entire marginalized-by-race group people? can't say every single racial ethnic group trying refer them. practically community transmission Australia Chilean flight crew disobeyed quarantine/isolation requirement 100 cases week shut borders instigated lockdown again.   
It takes bad decisions people go “we got handled” “here go again” spring layoffs temporary nursing positions highly used (OR, PACU,etc) due eliminating electives. even offered positions refused. furloughed paid emergency relief fund, per diems part timers aren’t eligible benefits (we two classes part time-some get benefits, dont) laid off. obviously kids infants close immune virus. least terms dying. country we've 1000+ deaths 3 age 50. 0 age 30.

It basically affect kids major way. even single serious case among kids hundreds thousands cases now. schools open. Makes sense. vaccine simple intramuscular injection. need basic aseptic training administer dose. Picker cotton according physics white = colour, darker = less colour. Please listen. know bias coded systems, right? I'm IT, KNOW bias coded systems. listen sometimes we're trying say. shit crazy mad exhausting explain we're dying explain it. Look hostile remarks thread. white people run america white people.

all talk equality never meant anything all

yet one actually fights freedom. isolated congress fighting, alone 

you deserve america, let happen Switzerland neutral conflict Coronavirus?  know sounds stupid one things I'm looking forward going everything junk food food place around. Mcdonald's, taco Bell, etc.

What better way celebrate surviving pandemic destroy health willingly. don’t know better busy squabbling realise rest us have. internet slowly changing though, slowly unfortunately. Less effective preventing infection tested first round trials (something like 65% vs 94%). Potentially higher new dosages, though. think joke 90% one half dose guess. idiot here

if someone one dose moderna yesterday, still (and spread) covid today?

thanks advance Probably depends contact time since ""immune"" persons immune system would target virus. mean like spraying something Lysol.

The true caregivers. That’s fair. guess get slightly defensive it’s system I’m involved in. amount time 2.5 million people tested positive Coronavirus. think quite cut dry. definition middle east (which thing relatively recently) race. bring good point, even examples found; think point still holds.

I may wrong, I'm thinking early discoveries might fit. Flemings penicillin teaching hospital became part taxpayer funded NHS.. think. possible ""discovery"" aspirin... even going back 150 years hard find things even discovery taxpayer funded place. scientists trained training might well 99% discovery.

Thanks sidetrack brain teaser, distracted doom scrolling appreciate :) Yeah, maybe politicians getting vaccines right might idiots it, they're probably reddit.

You'd think, no.

Exhibit A: Reinfection rare possible. I'd say keep preventative measures signal all-clear. 

Something mom asked answer seen written discussed anywhere os: person antibodies breaths virus someone could breathe pass someone else? 🤔 200,000 day still ""kinda"" slow want reach herd immunity end year though. least 50% population need get vaccinated get ""herd immunity"" soon (if exists COVID) take account people already infected. 200,000 vaccinations day far truly means 100,000 vaccinations day would mean half population vaccinated late winter. mean?

I’m going reply anymore cba Also several studies back up. think someone earlier even posted peer reviewed links. countries ? Like India way many people , good healthcare Okay, Liechtenstein makes lot dentures, like 20% world supply, asked someone know country they'd probably say ""that small tax nation Europe"" ""what's Liechtenstein"", fact making dentures immediately come mean known that, food immediately come mind thinking america mean good food. evidence provide racist? thigh cuff thing time.

Viruses mutate time. Dumb journalists getting desperate. Obviously ramp vaccination lot following weeks. 1 million 10 days 100,000 vaccinations day: taking account two vaccines given someone order gain full immunity, pace, takes 2 days vaccinate 100,000 people. There's 365 days year means roughly 20M vaccinated year. means increase vaccination rate 16-17 times vaccinate entire population end year. J&amp;J vaccine works take slower approach vaccination achieve goal one dose needed. interesting see US increase vaccination levels I'm talking about. Technically US wants reach herd immunity summer, got increase vaccination speed least 25 times Felt like crap how? sounds scary folks like carry antibodies donated plasma? plan getting vaccine shits giggles wonder really need year. literally says post never met him, went describe systems issue millions americans face. think much racial bias overall medical bureaucratic stupidity one example.

That said, I've personally witnessed incredible subvert overt racism healthcare. someone tell me... get vaccinated, giving use prove got it?

The statistical power study small. study found mortality 6% study group 11% control conclusion would difference. 


Likely real answer difference serious cases order 1%, test required achieve statistical power would something like 10000 cases.

We've given $1 raise. Twice. One right away one month ago.

Three $500 bonus checks. made sure $500 every employees pocket taxes.

Various thank gifts delivered home month. Food delivery gift cards, actual food various online companies (meal kits like), gizmos gadgets. 

If someone even felt little down. Stay home. paid us. risks taken.

I ask treated better. know major companies suck.

I say style. workers rights steadily increased decade decade... sure dont car fair, concept used work. Look boom period 90s, significantly invested back US employees economy whole actually felt like boom time opposed now.

Unfortunately past 20 years greed reigned even supreme. surprisingly millennials turn blind eye involves favorite trendy companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, etc. definitely helped local dealers indication helping lot people business booming NYC. he's star....they'll let it. what? Lot churches NC religious minded folks. Everyone needs believe something, IMHO various church leaders needed preach via zoom outside larger area. know easy, feel easier seeing friend family carried church funeral There's country batch tests millions whenever rears head, squashes partly way fast regional response/restrictions.

I condone much said country, honestly I'd expect superpower well funded pandemic response dept look like, compared we've/the US shown.

Anyways... they? obliged contracts? No? problem. 

Business charity run good employees. profitable operation run good owners workers contributing paid that. company loses money, workers still getting paid, paying back times hard... guess senior citizens aren’t people??? much party “pro life” lol Yeah. Agreed. Honestly think normality Fauci different us. day stop tracing etc normal prob. already said could see normality spring someone willing undercut competition angelnfunding reach monopoly power and/or transform customer product/profit.

Your ideology flawed leaking. Best got. terrible take. ton people live paycheck paycheck too. want to. want save 10% paycheck rainy day doesn’t work like that. Rather blame working class, blame government raising min wage since 2007. Blame billionaire CEO’s doubled wealth pandemic 20 million unemployed. lot happening America can’t say people living close edge. countries lovkdowns still managed help ppl. virus really exposed pure greed malice called democratic system. Every vaccine reduce sickness transmission, data prove yet, pretty confident Covid normal regard.

Even extremely unlikely situation vaccine prevent transmission all, still expect people mildly symptomatic would *lot* less infectious severely symptomatic cases, see research That's true. Fight among scraps. hope people get fed Robin Hood old oligarchs. necessary. partner noticed IV drip working birth. nurse never did. kind shrugged said need disconnected it. Even labor, told husband thought baby coming. went get nurse difficulty bringing someone room. nurse charge us said there's way progressed delivery stage. finally came checked immediately ran doctor. Like know baby's head emerging vagina? supposed predicted timetable? top tier hospital, ranked highly quality medical treatment. I've exercising balances got work, go gym, go stores try pickups much possible. wear mask everywhere go disinfect things ASAP. Nurse: *Shares alternate opinion situation*
Reddit: dare you! 

Lol dad sneezing cleering throat intensely lately. live dusty house stuff made anxious pandemic seems worse sure refuses get test. legit feel hopeless here, they’re gonna wait till say, beyond miserable live with. Wait, they? agree work working for, feel entitled employers profits. Amazon makes profit get drunk order inflatable dinosaurs, employees anything remit, did, that's promotions work, good job get promoted. principle applies COUNTRIES. THAT'S MASS INFLATION IS. LOWER COST LIVING I’ll eat bowl cereal regardless directly quoting study, never said thing deadly vaccine. call severe debate hope, lifetime, see massive transfer wealth. Either law, force. world would actually WAY prosperous part pie. addicted opioids 🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂 voted h Trump.
Now die poor decisions. That’s I’m saying. Fauci seems disagree think point reach herd immunity point reach normalcy, lied. Idk small businesses likely fuck normally try harder maintain customers. Small businesses certainly made bank year PPP loans though. Many got $ entire annual profits would been. area certainly paying forward too. mean isolate potentially infectious others? mean maintain social distancing infectious prevent standards? one infectious vaccine itself, since efficacy doesn’t kick week second dose people still behave though vaccinated bit longer. humming 🤫 get high 5-7 days week since pandemic, makes forget life like that’s good enough mean, money still part though. may make “a lot” near enough that’s worth this. fiancée nurse NY that’s feel. It’s enough Social security would worthless topic though, that's wanted rant US imperialist nation, specifically settler colonialist one, *takes* things little regard people. imperialist entitlement that's got Americans triggered.

So gonna discount two hundred year old cornbread recipes *not American* because, what, white grammas invent corn? *apple pie* really food borne rural American poverty iMpErIaLiSm? counters behind actual administration. know hospital I’m already given vaccinations waiting next week. frustrating many reasons mainly admitting government health officials manipulating information “what public handle” lens. us looking facts left untrusting info coming government even legit. 

What rest society looking conspiracies?? Corporate greed rules america. get away can, people ok take stand. figure little bit longer, hair never long currently. LOL said cases decreasing half states, means they’re rising half states, hence line looks flat last couple days leave house. go hiking go doctor's appointments. wear surgeon style mask hiking, restrict breathing.

outdoors relatively safe. article conversation Southern California. keep downplaying virus. Good job. It’s way early tell. Yes work based subtle mutations are, said last comment removed, it’s easy modify mRNA vaccine. They’re essentially plug play US failed bunch self-entitled, selfish assholes. 

There belief one’s self, greater good collective. latter seen socialistic communistic. Why? We’re still hooked Cold War propaganda. more. Looks like someone traveled California uk/ south Africa month half ago post rant like this. NYT worst IMO. keep publishing articles week UK variant much contagious even though isn’t fully established yet. published interview “disaster oracle” back June saying would years normalcy returns. wannabe psychic, pass legitimate information.

I turned news notifications phone April reactivated election week. media rooting worst case outcomes, looking readership viewership ratings 2020 makes abundantly clear why: they’re time highs.

Sad... Look up? One overall statistic doesn’t determine cause situation. Even hospital. can’t look hospitals information, made claim able back up. Show info hospital sending proportionally people color home make understand claim accurate. downvote continue bad faith arguments. 

Btw healthcare system joke general needs gutted US. wrap gifts, long family wait open them? Covid travel surfaces? tested positive yesterday. Profits go owners, wages go workers. Simple ain’t it? Woah color surprised!

 /s case Yeah leaves sour taste mouth. Even 90% figure ends high estimate, matter put it, example deliberately misleading public vital health information. That's like asking someone farted next you, would help people breathing near inhale it. happens people's bodies really affect you.  Isn’t called salary?! long vaccine available - that’s fine.

My biggest fear vaccine won’t effect England strain. seen Europe treats native gypsies? read 40% people dont want take vaccine U.S. say getting doses every week. Instead slow rolling vaccine sitting massive surplus. massive surplus even accounting second doses held.

Fun bonus hospital can't sure get second doses, also keep second dose reserve, meaning minimum holding double reserve. thoughts Italy. I’m looking forward seeing again. source prevalent younger people? Right. phase trials, confirm works, theory. could vaccine months ago use theory validation.

I trust guys know they're doing, fact validated yet give dose confidence, headlines like feed false confidence something confirmed yet. pandemic ending doesn’t necessarily happen time normality. perfectly reasonable think time spring ending life mostly normal mainstream ones US. CNN, NBC, CBS, etc good explanation US allotted 11 million doses already, 1.1 million administered? would thought initial round US, administered rate would track allotted rate high %. relevance Michelin stars food actually eaten normal people regular basis? good food too, get butt. doesn’t sound like quick access, I’m happy you. least one us safe lol way downplayed virus. Yes. feel you. one I’m right pretty busy Woah hope people realize that’s pretty fucking big statement made best friend ER nurse Hollywood. says ICU full, ER full halls full paramedics patients waiting bed people coding over. god hurting religious? information given article doesn’t seem worrying. It’s around since least July. says vaccines issue currently evidence it’s even transmissible. God poor thing. rediculous. Yep, try holding nose eat. also kids hold noses take liquid medicine. can't divulge information customer's secret illegal account. hell would they? Thats capitalism baby. none me..scraps pittance make money.
Tax fucking shit people/corporations allready. Jesus would want to. “As white person, personal experience seems prove wrong racism, racism affects life. Personal biases don’t affect professional environments.”

Yet.. minority yourself, intimately aware personal biases others affected life. provided counter-examples claims misogyny male perspective, would helpful?

Think through, tell white friends. black community thanks advance service here. mother worst. It’s coping. refuse accept reality. terrifies them. it’s easier deny reality create own. Nice ~~article~~ link blog, seem mention ""Fast track designation"" given FDA least vaccine. I'm gonna waste time though. information 2 minutes. percent estimate, Dr. Katherine O’Brien, agency’s director immunization, said thought range low. declined estimate correct higher one might be.

“We’d leaning thin reeds tried say level vaccine coverage would needed achieve it,” said. “We say don’t know. won’t world even national number. depend community live in.”

Dr. Dean noted stop transmission crowded city like New York, people would achieve immunity would necessary less crowded place like Montana.

Even Dr. Fauci right take 85 even 90 percent herd immunity completely stop coronavirus transmission, Dr. Lipsitch said, “we still defang virus sooner that.”

He added: “We don’t zero transmission order decent society. lots diseases, like flu, transmitting time, don’t shut society that. vaccinate almost people risk severe outcomes, would become milder disease.”




Wow long article lmao tried low dose 50/50 edibles? It’s easier manage intake rather smoking. NYT one biggest cheerleaders war Iraq despite evidence anything go war over. They’ve always trash. might Fox News OANN, NYT Washington Post etc dogshit untrustworthy outlets right. Amazon gotten substantially slower comes shipping things good reason!

 Instead shipping things advertised 'in stock' right away, semblance quick, hold onto order days weeks. Then, say 'we offer 2-5 day shipping SHIPPED dumb peasant!'

I made order stuff Dec. 10. shipped. expected Jan 18th. I'm slowly migrating Target, Walmart, Ebay.

I'd rather miserable year reason, rather mostly miserable occasionally exposed. Keep spreading word every time find something like bc new normal crew pretty well lately also became clearer later “superspreader events,” one person infects dozens even hundreds others, played large role spreading Covid-19. events, “normal” populations — one wears masks everyone attends events like parties, basketball tournaments Broadway shows — push reproduction number upward 4, 5 even 6, experts said. Consequently, scenarios call higher herd immunity; example, R0 5, four five people, 80 percent, must immune slow virus.

Further complicating matters, growing consensus among scientists virus becoming transmissible. variant “Italian strain” mutation known D614G spread much faster original Wuhan variant. newly identified mutation, sometimes called N501Y, may make virus even infectious recently appeared Britain, South Africa elsewhere.

The transmissible pathogen, people must become immune order stop it.

Dr. Morens Dr. Lipsitch agreed Dr. Fauci level herd immunity needed stop Covid-19 could 85 percent higher. “But that’s guesstimate,” Dr. Lipsitch emphasized.

“Tony’s reading tea leaves,” Dr. Morens said.

The Centers Disease Control Prevention offers herd immunity estimate, saying website “experts know.” Amazon spread even market Prime Pick delivery service - picking things local businesses delivering percent monthly service fee? would mean ever faster client serving potential, less warehouse space inventory needed, bite market, still letting local businesses stay around. would allow Amazon offer specialty items less redundancy. Perhaps poors thought decided born non-capitalist non-billionaires

Why Amazon Walmart anything nice people whose labor depend exploit deadly pandemic?

/s naming depart run Microsoft Mexican I'm always wondering work there, companies actually offer less minimum wage? illegals get paid cash? accountable tax system robust?
 I've thinking migrating USA (I pretty good life wage insecurity bonkers here) I'm afraid I'll overworked thrown bus company work for, USA labor laws God awful Yes needs sorted workers need protected help protect residents. Soooo many subreddits filled people don’t know free market works. definitely spent 2020 2019. never shopped Walmart covid ones offer pick delivery near me. people dying covid EVERY DAY 9-11, yet types still think covid hoax senators shit people voted continued say virus fake like “VACCINE?!?!? FIRST!!!!” Epidemiologists watching fast cases doubled outbreaks calculated virus’s reproduction number, R0 — many new victims carrier infected — 3. two three potential victims would become immune carrier infected fewer one. carrier infects fewer one new victim, outbreak slowly dies out.

Two three 66.7 percent, established range 60 70 percent herd immunity.

Reinforcing notion study conducted French military crew aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, outbreak late March, said Dr. Christopher J.L. Murray, director University Washington’s Institute Health Metrics Evaluation.

the outbreak still progress, crew went quarantine, unclear whether virus finished infecting new sailors even 68 percent caught it.

Also, outbreaks aboard ships poor models land infections move much faster close quarters vessel free-roaming civilian population, said Dr. Natalie E. Dean, biostatistician University Florida.

More important, early estimates Wuhan Italy later revised upward, Dr. Lipsitch noted, Chinese scientists realized undercounted number victims first wave. took two months certain many asymptomatic people also spread virus. Trickle right? already happened family friend. stroke get help right away hospital overburdened. 

He died complications. come 2 variants start, fine many months, bunch variants popped up? working me! worry, trickle-down economics take care it. /s Here's thing, lobby congress keep wages benefits down. claim can't afford pay workers penny more, they'll go business, move headquarters overseas, blah blah blah. owners rake BILLIONS profits.

The elite class even willing keep poor workers alive anymore. Wealth inequality gone totally unchecked decades, end result. Small companies willing make modest profits pay workers well can't compete ruthlessness Amazon Walmart. “You tell numbers put equations, I’ll give answer,” said Marc Lipsitch, epidemiologist Harvard’s T.H. Chan School Public Health. “But can’t tell numbers, nobody knows them.”

The truly accurate measures herd immunity done actual herds come studying animal viruses like rinderpest foot-and-mouth disease, said Dr. David M. Morens, Dr. Fauci’s senior adviser epidemiology National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases.

When cattle penned corrals, easy measure fast disease spreads one animal another, said. Humans move around, studying disease spread among far harder.

The original assumption would take 60 70 percent immunity stop disease based early data China Italy, health experts noted. Dude he’s saying context two different times. could potentially either Well that's silly article entire discussion healthcare CA. Wage pressure real unemployment/stimulus crept in, real gains left willing work.

I optomistic type innovation slow offshoring business people intensive bring back opportunties onshore. Probably title article clear point. want deadlier

you want people die?

that’s said dumb fuck look dumb right Pepperidge Farm Remembers might discouraging Americans, said, sure enough voluntary acceptance vaccines reach goal. Although sentiments vaccines polls bounced year, several current ones suggest 20 percent Americans say unwilling accept vaccine. 

Also, Dr. Fauci noted, herd-immunity figure 90 percent range infectiousness measles.

“I’d bet house Covid isn’t contagious measles,” said.

Measles thought world’s contagious disease; linger air hours drift vents infect people rooms. studies outbreaks crowded military barracks student dormitories, kept transmitting 95 percent residents infected.

Interviews epidemiologists regarding degree herd immunity needed defeat coronavirus produced range estimates, line Dr. Fauci’s. also came warning: answers merely “guesstimates.” Please don’t feel guilty. letting down. way around day one what? reasonable Oh please bullshit. literally wrote want deadlier. Get fuck outta shit. Anyone already convinced wearing masks important likely convinced this. even people coming senses better none. similar make bit cautious direct stimulus. much go China junk? 3 vaccines (‿|‿) mean era straight white men allowed fully participate American society? may misunderstood 7% figure. numbers also discussed person working project thread. idea scattering cases doesn’t hold it’s inaccurate don’t original infection samples. doesn’t rule reinfection occurring. 

You read discussion Dr. Fauci said weeks ago, hesitated publicly raise estimate many Americans seemed hesitant vaccines, would need accept almost universally order country achieve herd immunity.

Now polls showing many Americans ready, even eager, vaccines, said felt could deliver tough message return normal might take longer anticipated.

“When polls said half Americans would take vaccine, saying herd immunity would take 70 75 percent,” Dr. Fauci said. “Then, newer surveys said 60 percent would take it, thought, ‘I nudge bit,’ went 80, 85.”

“We need humility here,” added. “We really don’t know real number is. think real range somewhere 70 90 percent. But, I’m going say 90 percent.” much longer...


*Boston Dynamics entered chat You’re wishing deadlier. dumb fuck. say eat tenth taco Taco Bell right though, time. pandemic’s early days, Dr. Fauci tended cite 60 70 percent estimate experts did. month ago, began saying “70, 75 percent” television interviews. last week, interview CNBC News, said “75, 80, 85 percent” “75 80-plus percent.”

In telephone interview next day, Dr. Fauci acknowledged slowly deliberately moving goal posts. so, said, partly based new science, partly gut feeling country finally ready hear really thinks.

Hard may hear, said, believes may take close 90 percent immunity bring virus halt — almost much needed stop measles outbreak.

Asked Dr. Fauci’s conclusions, prominent epidemiologists said might proven right. early range 60 70 percent almost undoubtedly low, said, virus becoming transmissible, take greater herd immunity stop it. Except wages paid workers. employing people ever before. know several people laid retail food service jobs making working Amazon. Herd immunity much environments group behavior immune systems.

A Finnish circle computer scientists might get away 30% vaccinated isolated cases.

For cruise ships, colleges, ski resorts religious communities, 80% enough prevent larger outbreaks.

The next steps public learning:

- Like refuse wear masks, others refuse get vaccinated.
- Vaccines reduce risk severe disease. (I sure hope Moderna's initial 30:0 results indicative proportion.)
- People 60 overload hospitals.
- Death rate depends hospital strain, even specific treatments.
- People 40 suffer Long Covid years. rare. Gosh hate quote buried article. day Queen save God Vitamin D, Zinc, Melatonin, Vitamin C...now K. Damn, health conscious since baby.

Since start pandemic, figure many epidemiologists offered 60 70 percent. range still cited World Health Organization often repeated discussions future course disease.

Although impossible know certainty limit reach transmission stops, good estimate important: gives Americans sense hope breathe freely again.

Recently, figure millions Americans look guidance — Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, adviser Trump administration incoming Biden administration — begun incrementally raising herd-immunity estimate. mRNA vaccine compound formulated one day chinese published genome *should* worries me. I'm comfortable assuming risk Baja &amp; Bagmeat. I'm gonna eat home I'm vaccinated, instead gambling whether Randy decided allergies drive through. know like 4 catastrophic failures would occur get sick buying takeaway... frankly ***the year** catastrophic failures.

Everything changes risk level. privileged enough able home, I've store last 8 months, flu shot insurance. I'm pleased stay home excuse doughy self eat fast food year. “If that, efficiently enough second quarter 2021, time get end summer, i.e., third quarter, may actually enough herd immunity protecting society get end 2021” Also virus mutates direction. really selection pressure infect kids. company loses money, workers get laid off

FTFY Reddit scientist vibes lol Basically businesses/public places constantly disinfecting common touch points though. fomite transmission significant measures helped have. I’m talking anti vaxxers. generally normal ppl like ones article. America’s enemies lol what? Yeah, sensationalist headlines now.

If investors profiting, lowest employees pay shouldn’t low legally permissible.

Either starve investors too, pay employees better.

Not mention minimum wage high enough employees don’t qualify social safety nets. Sir, please suggest country unit. possible way bad actors around.

Since people dont care following orders, dont think care lockdown 4-5 months now. think make take favorite places vacation like bars, cruise, concert even travelling plane require show covid vaccination card.

Also, clear: condition prevents people getting vaccine severe vaccine allergy, very, rare. think foolish eat fast food certain components heated buns, salads, deserts, etc. people willing sacrifice 6-9 months normal life protect old, sick dying.

I'm sacrificing months stop 20 30-somethings getting fever. really believe covid? Jmo think sort tactic whatever reasons. opinion like said though. dying covid risk probably selfish way think it.

 live society, actions affect people Ugh, remember, thought utter bs suspect right that. Unfortunately happen point virus come roaring right back we'll another huge surge. death rate would still significantly lower, that's hardly concern virus leave even mild initial cases debilitating symptoms months or, may eventually find out, years. 

And governors choice start shutting things again. truly, truly worst enemies. bit rude ask me. important caveat infectious affects you.

I’ve seen idiots work try say viruses (in general) haven’t proven contagious. CDC said covid airborne though? long get take second one offered that's better, sure. think even people safe wear masks around family, makes holidays much dangerous.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Perfection! Scientists also say it’s unlikely life look exactly like 2019 again. **new normal**, may mask-wearing flu season crowded places awareness raised. probably systems place prevent pandemics deadly, Professor Castor said. include methods tracking emerging infections screening activities like flying.

**New Normal** - let's see many people trigger...lol. skinny unhealthy, point Baby steps... need 1.3 1.6 million day get done end June. Fear drives clicks, clicks drive ad revenue back limited, 100-day mandate. time mandate ends, age/risk group accounts 99% deaths vaccinated, goes plan.

At point, start heading back towards normal. Hey, Dems take senate GA runoffs might get nationwide legalization got fingers crossed you! Honestly hard. Ive done zero waste years multiple times people still buy crap. start refusing gifts. found rude first years. eventually saw was, conviction. vaccine 95% effective, (basically) hurt kill individuals vaccinated. (The 95% efficacy means take current covid risk divide 20. means that, per [CDC risk death 50-69 age group decrease 1 200 1 40,000. risk even lower younger people). 

The people cannot receive vaccine people known allergic ingredients. However, actually *very, very* tiny number people (somewhere neighborhood 1 million leaves something like 350 people U.S. *cannot* receive vaccine. everyone else, personal choice point.

Once everyone offered opportunity take vaccine, go back normal, herd immunity not. State agencies used less 10% in-hand vaccines. That's real bottleneck is. Thanks go site read articles? damn annoying articles blocked. Wow dude. Seriously? ""Slow spread"" control mutation ridiculous going work zoonotic virus like Corona. control humans like. still mutate animals jump people helpful moment getting Moderna doses spring. spend much money want, demographic believes vaccine bad/evil sure hell going buy multi-million dollar government sponsored PR campaign. still think behavior worse literally everywhere else US. ton people CA taking seriously. I'm sure lot people talking (realize reason know frowned upon). I'm unrelated subs people many walks life rest US say they're without ever stopping absurd me, like we're living alternate realities. even schools open much state. yeah LA worse (I think basically poor Latinos got, worse - due mainly crowded living conditions large households type work) exact trend statewide. LA always starts taking 2 weeks Bay Area starts increasing same. decline many times. dropped presents moms still pretended surprised didn’t want stay coffee least, ask please put masks on. wore masks brought heavy gifts put tree, said hi grandma.

These kind people driving holiday travel... 🙄 Slaoui pushed back initial goal 20,000,000 people getting first shot end December first week January. 1,000,000 people gotten first shot, apparently [11,000,000 first doses allotted I'm sure whether allotted doses shipped, they've entered distribution supply chain.

If issue 10,000,000 unused doses hospitals long term care facilities yet, I'm frustrated federal government. issue 10,000,000 unused doses hospitals facilities, injected yet, I'm frustrated actual hospitals facilities. likelihood little bit both, lot comes fact we've started this, still issues process need smoothed out. one several reasons countries like Taiwan New Zealand managed become Covid-free. Narrator: ""Yes"" mentioned article saw unfortunately exact work done... closely tracking variations/ mutations virus inform public health decisions . 
Covid mutation patterns date typical corona virus general. FWIW, entire friend circle 10 close friends thing. None us Covid.

In opinion, covid spreading prolonged unmasked exposure confined places. giving lot credit critical thought process people, 80 million strong, type travelling, air, actively murder family act.

The people taking covid seriously take cues bad pandemic sure, ""how bad pandemic is"" relative channels gaining information unfortunately misinformation. 

People relying assessment others gauge situation, change point. People essentially putting faith one set decision makers going break faith large enough numbers make difference. 

If fact science based sources say regardless vaccinations, XYZ steps need take place however long; sudden going disregard council believe kept alive/safe go family night Pizza Hut stop attack Family Dinner Night. 

Vaccination no, realistically never return old ""normal"", old normal landed us state. 

Everyone adjust new normal, hopefully worked science populism politics, taking shapes course years, weeks, order prevent something scale happening EVER again.  one single link working. 

I also talking scientific evidence random media articles. You’re intentionally obtuse I’m going go echo another commenters sentiments. Fuck Thanks! Smoking regular bud works me. empathizing person can't use cannabis.

It's frustrating friends advocate medical marijuana tell reason use regular medicine alongside cannabis (for bipolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder) ""haven't found right strain yet.""

There weird elitism/med shaming among people able stop using pharmaceuticals use weed. make us use (or can't use weed use regular medicine) feel alienated. Lockdown policies lol’ed cite you’re getting half hospitalizations 65? it’s [definitely true say hospitalization rate isn’t far higher among older 

It’s also higher-risk younger people hospitalized most, they’ll likely mostly vaccinated mid-summer. live Texas, may never know luxury. hate sound petty I’m incredibly jealous. Enigma. read something else :x answer would then. need exhale enough virus person inhale minimum infectious dose. you, yourself, inhaling minimum infectious dose, minutes/hours enough time exhale dose large enough infect person whether antibodies not.

You know what's disgusting? knowing thing talking about, spewing like vile, propagating false information. would nice people post articles actually read them. Wtf point posting article one read? Similarly, one estimate suggests America sequenced 40 samples since beginning December, compared 3,700 Britain.

Most recently, left AMA medical staff refused believe pain. Oh, yeah, guess acute pancreatitis nothing pain excessive vomiting I’ve four days even went hospital.

I asked could give something pain. said could give pain medicine every six hours... ten since last aspirin. Knowing treat non-POC friends, they’d one morphine drips (I stories former friends mine - mostly male, mostly White - became addicts hospital visits. also stories people prescribed illegal counts drugs somehow got away refilling multiple times pharmacy never flagged).

Caused bit uproar Panama government talking big one first countries latinamerica get vaccine...in February.

Funny aside. Back pandemic started government made tons international comparisons, never Costa Rica knew numbers Costa Rica better(And think policies made way sense). like Costa Rica exist all. shit hit fan really hard, government stopped making international comparisons all. passed minimum 50%, mention actual efficiency rate is.

Vitamin K potassium. member public implore feel guilt. hero never doubt that. bottom heart thank you. makes sense though. Yeah shame people putting aside whole year's worth emergency funds! yet...

Overdose deaths still outnumber Covid deaths 3:1 San Francisco.

And think this: behind every overdose countless people done permanent damage minds bodies generally ruined Got Pfizer vaccine yesterday! tend think, mentioned article, brains adapt lower risk, start spending time large crowds don’t get sick, slowly become comfortable again. Also it’s likely 5% less severe disease metadrama please. point money deployed actually getting vaccines arms. We're 10% usage vaccines in-hand. problem reticence, state agencies bungling getting arms. chance hospitalized, measures actual percentage occupancy hospitals. 

Yes, former matters far people gauge risk. think even that’s case news cycle, people won’t anywhere near level fear. Despite holier-than-thou talk throughout this, people concerned closest family members - 'greater good' faceless 'vulnerable people' always claimed.

Once families vaccine, risk cut 20th (likely tiny) number previously. 

They'll right back normal. Yeah, IIRC hospital ship field hospitals NYC used treat non-covid related illnesses injuries open resources hospitals treat Covid patients exclusively.

The issue may become apparent next weeks case March-May NYC NJ, manpower issue...

Back Tri-state's first chaotic outbreak spring, issues resources bed-space particularly hard hit hospitals, rest nation dealing widespread outbreaks time nurses flown bussed around country help deal strain.

Now entire country fire virus running rampant every region degree, far less nurses, doctors, technicians medical professionals shipped around help deal particularly hard hit regions case load. 

That's I'm worried weeks come, especially particularly hard hit areas like LA parts California. threads people saying distancing masking next Fall. like look outside see millions acting riskier riskier. million one week, 4.6 mil projected next week. it’s ramping pretty quickly. guess depends much manpower mobilized vaccination efforts hospitals etc already running maximum (or rather way beyond that). phase 1, wait pharmacies (there's 88k US), general practitioners volunteers care homes etc mix, - similar regular flu shots administered decentrally. plus vaccines, ( like J&amp;J one) require one shot instead two. all, guess logististical question point, i'd hope US get (arbitrary) treshold late springtime, goes planned. cheers germany, i'm doctor DeSantis = Mismanagement COVID-19. Wasnt something posted said masks arent effective, social distancing? work again? clear, viruses constantly mutating, technically, new sequence variant. evidence suggest variant described meaningfully different other, common variants virus. pushing idea since march, but, unfortunately, nearly everyone government media taking responsibility public shifting healthcare system making seem like war happening hospitals pushing healthcare heroes narrative.

i happy know message finally mainstream support. Give break suspect right that. Unfortunately happen point virus come roaring right back we'll another huge surge. death rate would still significantly lower, that's hardly concern virus leave even mild initial cases debilitating symptoms months or, may eventually find out, years.

These extreme cases, though.

The vast majority young healthy people shake off, often without realizing they've it. (I one, antibodies showed week low fever).

The messaging around strong consistent: reduce deaths protect hospital capacity. achieved March/April. must rapid return normalcy 3-4 months that. Cowards! Yes, think normal come everyone wants get vaccine able get Depends virus you’re comparing too. mutates much slower flu. Similar coronaviruses, pretty limited mutations none substantial would say wanted sell vacine Well yeah recent poll

55% FDNY firefighters get Covid-19 vaccine offered department, poll see really happens election crap gets brains Hospitalization rate age isn’t thing percentage people hospital age group. One chance hospitalized, measures actual percentage occupancy hospitals.  don’t think hospitals get overwhelmed younger patients older demographics vaccinated, reality demographics swing younger people occupying hospital beds. certainly bet news cycle dominated stories, whether that’s right thing happen not. shifting burden responsibility public belongs helps alleviate overwhelming pressure feel.

There's pretty big overlap folks taking plague seriously folks say things like ""freedom free."" 

Well, civilians taking hit time. Ah yes, millions people skipped going vacation holiday spending every year. realize working poor take vacations ever, buy one present less per kid holidays. problem, 20 million work, money government gave us barely covered 1.5 months rent, people starving, billionaire class doubled net worth. government didn’t provide people needed most, employers didn’t provide us help many top companies made money hand fist, audacity blame average Joe didn’t save enough money. Unreal also got R0 &lt; 1

Really? Sweden averaging 200 new cases 2 deaths per day throughout summer period? That's ten times higher Finland Norway.

It Sweden's testing woefully inadequate spring, would it?

Remember excuse much higher number confirmed cases second wave testing spring catching vast majority cases. going change story now? honest can’t give answer political social decision, necessarily something clue Wear mask stringently chances wear mask stringently multiple years decreases. Seems like pretty simple proposition me. Fortunately, national debt work like personal debt ever ""paid back"" sense. Governments perpetual funding source treasury/bond market. always issue new debt pay back previous debt. need get pandemic, get house order, grow way debt interest becomes much smaller part national budget. know easier said done really choice. grow stagnate. Stop! pleasuring dystopia! vaccine done anything anyway. receiving day anything passing  preface fairly bad anxiety general

Today went local convenience store get things went pretty packed (I’d say 50 people fairly small store. People squeezing isles, people talking place, masks (except one guy saw take bit back on). store total ~10 minutes, time waiting long line. Afterwards, washed hands used hand sanitizer. scenario like this, risk level potentially contracting COVID? Thank matter, country's billionaires gained around 1.5 trillion covids.... they'll spot us dimes. what's point? media cover mutuations they're 'expected'?

Maybe pandemic coverage like coronavirus might've sparked action could've made somewhat easier?

I dunno, spitballing here. how? fuck? Deaths per year typically leave margin error year year. We've outside margin since April dimwit. OK, needs specific.

There's mental health crisis every time talks 'normal' far-off distance, pushes people deeper hole.

When he's asked normality, people want know return Old Normal. People asking 'will public health officials still tracking Covid' 'will masks hospitals'. Considering 20 percent Americans confirmed case, conservative estimate unconfirmed cases confirmed cases 3:1, considering people cross immunity coronaviruses like common cold although don’t know many, looks like won’t long reach it, matter high is. weight likely kill thank covid Reducing spread infection == reducing death suffering. really thing.

If vaccinated shedding virus, cause death suffering actions. envision someone wait see crowd changing tune friend family member bad Covid outcome, especially said family member following restriction rules. What's essential worker? seems like everyone essential worker Good data independent scientists strongly suggests will. They’ve done neutralization assays , demonstrates antibodies patients old strain maintain immunity new one.  course do. 

I work hospital. every day walk 15-20 patient rooms it’s job help people. them, complete stranger. understand order help them/treat them, NEED trust without even knowing me. 

By taking vaccine, ask patients me. trusting researchers, doctors, scientists healthcare professionals involved vaccine’s production trustworthy am. 

This comes trust healthcare community. member community, feel worthy trust. Much better hands. issue black latino communities. either drug seekers, refuse listen send us way. disgusting. hope mend. vaccines already rushed. dont get anology true, governments make people pay rest, unfortunately dominated them. real problem position totally would without parents mind everyone would pictures printed berries safe eat go foraging wilderness got random drug once. symptoms like mono, said strep (hint: actually mono).

But gave whatever antibiotic (I wanna say Pen VK) sent way. called like week later survey asked helping. Like, don’t know. don’t even know I’m treated things same. Worth noting study monkeys virus delivered straight lungs much higher dose person would encounter real world scenario. Thank posting this. nice reminder caring people. Maker Pfizer rich 🤣🤣 Lol KNOW racism?.?... derp Sorry confused you. hope understand now. Jesus christ, doesn't. lists correlations. understand said?  Hmmm. 5 bars... shit  I'll take'm both. One buttock. sure co-infection infection immediately other, suspect antibodies produced former fight second infection. also said second severe. There's scientific article link, also first one world reporting situation What's even annoying (EM doc) tell something best guess/assertion demand see another doctor seem sure myself. honest, know, Emergency need tests outpatient. tell think is, I'm wrong get tests, I'm called idiot put blast every doctor rating site get hands on. lose lose sometimes. many like control aspects people’s lives. Like ACLU, specifically. Pretty easy leave stuff garage door days need though. 1 million crazy risk taking lab rats gambling health reason. feel way. cancelled parents last minute they're devistated. 3 separate households visiting, can't good conscience risk immediate families lives visiting. father pregnant wife, many variables level's complexity makes visiting incomprehensible.

First Xmas missed parents, deeply saddened, know best. Obviously vaccine safer getting fucking COVID, matter time happens work hospital. idea what's going people's heads. worldwide, rich countries. hey, ok right. data... online survey made wannabe journalism/activist... say we're going get anyway, might well get with

COVID is, one sense, *harvester virus*. combines thru population seeking weak immune systems. sentient, transmit widely. need careful, *getting with* predictable outcome. would say Britain #1 list. It’s incredible much invested study sequence thing. 


That said, believe US playing role help fund sequencing endeavors. guess said controversial; genuinely don’t understand is... I’m excited burn mask explain lack surge cases though?

By data wrong. article bit early Dec 7th, death rate topped 16th, exactly expected, 3 weeks Thanksgiving.

Bad article, bad data. Ah thanks feel refreshed Idiots closed everything except supermarkets drugstores Netherlands still cases climbing. almost impossible get control higher infection rate mutation.

Meanwhile UK even pubs still open many areas... is... impressive. hasn’t even two weeks yet, we’re seven digits.  Yep, here. gotten plane year. think going airports constantly bad idea. hope family safe.

I'm completely void guilt here. going road trip (driving straight 1 stop sleep) father gonna us (I'm making sure masks, gloves, sanitize everything) since antibodies, worry myself. going gathering. live together one thing find joy think make father really happy. know ton Mormons Utah mask deniers. lot Mormons voted trump. That’s completely diff topic. nothing said. Already told I’m debating feelings bruh. atheists, anti-theists. I’m simply atheist. Way show massive misunderstanding information. news? It’s unfortunate, coronavirus deadly , stories like playing every state, everyday 

Unless anomaly reported way frighten? heard radio NPR link seems cover relevant dosing related You’d think used get allergy shots one nurse would always make arm numb safer catching fucking COVID. Cool Cali me, drugs, rainbows unicorns, Gold nuggets poking coast line US Government currently track Santa across world Covid19 Doctor Dies Coronavirus Saying Hospital Mistreating Black

Look little harder sweetheart, know make *Highlights* magazines difficult... friend nursing student got vaccine already much due fact somewhat ""flattened curve"". 

Now curve way up, mortality bound go again. I'm sure chronic brain fog accurately characterized ""very little impact."" California also high homeless population could attributing high numbers. Vaccines remind high school girlfriend; lots teasing promises. Yes worth it; would better without wait. I’m confused. Media outlets nonstop talking new variant South Africa... saying it’s also contagious new variant discovered UK. also reporting South Africa variant “mutated even further” UK one.

I thought new variant UK &amp; South Africa one same? That’s I’m confused about. Earlier week reported ONE new variant found places. get yo' ass lentils stop wasting money bearded dragons last good long time. Personally cash flow lentil consumption hot wife using dividends get van guards. Incompetence color blind. lot incompetent idiots working every field. Assume everyone stupid make life easier. Maybe, maybe not.

In cases we're still waiting follow data regarding whether vaccines give sterilizing immunity (eg. can't even get asymptomatic infection spread others). one vaccine already known *not* create sterilizing immunity (AstraZeneca) also create sterilizing immunity pre-clinical study monkeys. others (mostly) did.

Specifically, trying detect coronavirus nasal oral secretions vaccinated monkeys challenge virus, results were:

* 0/8
* 0/6 (although 2/6 positive oropharyngeal swab)
* 6/6

Does mean sterilizing immunity humans? know yet. know Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine much worse *in monkeys*, least reason hope poor results humans good prediction we'll see vaccines.

We'll still keep masks prevent idiots lying vaccination status get wearing mask. Pfizer Moderna vaccines turn better creating sterilizing immunity, we'll start seeing changes transmission well reaching ""herd immunity"" threshold, might possible step distancing measures sooner predicted.

As poster's original intentions regarding burger places vaccinated -- see reason s/he would wait months vaccination that. May able eat restaurant yet, pre-vaccine they've cautious avoiding food prepared others, think ""a weeks vaccination"" sounds like reasonable time able stop enjoy celebratory fast food treat! two 372% effectiveness? Damn that's impressive. Yeah, aspirin :( apparent lack post-Thanksgiving ""surge"".

Yet record death number Dec 16th, exactly 3 weeks Thanksgiving. Damn would totally weren’t blind. even drug test that’s dope every member US Congress pushes Welcome pro-M4A. 

Every citizen right emergency care regular check ups make entire healthy 🤫 really think vast majority populations delusional science-deniers. lot travel workplace restrictions require people vaccinated.  US spends least amount foreign aid western country, 0.18% gdp. spends 21 times much money US military.

This money priorities politicians messed up. seem generic particularly useful. Lol no. course, reports fomite transmission frozen goods. I’m sure you’ve gotten dismissive “Oh, can’t figure wrong, give [random drug]” then, too. Totally, maybe planned better vaccine distribution, we’ve waiting months. said, it’s still huge IMHO. think black though. went thing Memorial Texas. I'm white. training processing staff properly. insurance company call school them. still work, went somewhere else.

On another note, sheer amount incompetence I've experienced doctors staggering. took son gastroenterologist getting chronically constipated food allergies breast milk told doctor, ""I think he's allergic peanuts"". Well, doctor convinced consumption peanuts, rather cow's milk insisted stop consuming cow's milk. Guess what? allergic peanuts, tree nuts, gluten, legumes, raisins, chickpeas, strawberries. allergic cow's milk. 

And could tell number times I've doctor tell eczema food allergies caused washing properly, I'd blue face. even dermatologist tell me, straight face told eczema autoimmune condition, certainly not. BTW, PhD cell molecular biology.

I've also suffered medical issues years treated nothing hysterical female. turns serious genetic illness know pregnant. doctors crap country. get proper diagnostic training. anything complicated cold, good luck. see getting funding long term. I'm already hearing food shortages care centers. I'm thinking given elevated risk contracting Covid; might possible get moved priority vaccine. someone would probably complain testing poor.

Still think little bad PR would worth lives saved, long voluntary expect much backlash. cannot without infusion cash uncle Sam Nope happening.  someone may negative effects vaccine work required ability anything ? 


I can’t see could bad thing Lol point fuck immune system enough population vaccinated achieve herd immunity, 80% more. could take end 2021 I'd guess, maybe fall 2021. folks attacking education intelligence saying there's race problem. say I'm deranged. Someone legit called deranged saying ""something"" race. Deranged. 🤷🏾‍♀️ “Sorry kids - dinner tonight. need lock homes forever ( lose homes course since working safe.)”

“Also school you! activity outside normal cause mutation! “ wish way exclude covid deniers covid medical treatment way protect kids victims this. 

I totally get rage mask thing. job implemented mask policy almost one follows. Everyday feels like going super spreader event. kinda wish corona virus deadlier. people would actually scared stay home.  BioNTech said ended happening, altering vaccine viable option since virus totally new virus. finish testing vaccine new mutation 2 weeks. would definitely back day 1. obviously better saving 1500 lives day... dozens experiences treated differently (in general way, medically) skin color. talk publicly, get replies like ‘What race it?’ true, make dent still bunch old white guys running show. young white EM doc grew racially diverse area, makes sick things heard years. I've reported several colleagues. take another 10 years significant change physicians. Vaccines: “Am joke you?” trained professional letting personal politics make dumb uneducated worse. power hurt people come medical help.

It's impressive determine doctors decision due personal politics literally zero education, training, experience. I’m mixed too. big problem, got strep throat 3 doctors visits tested even believed something wrong me.

I even got sent home without rapid strep test pointed 8 pain chart, telling I’d pain strep :( I've always thought black people may less likely develop addiction walk tighter line reasons avoid things like partying (they'll get shot cops) drugs (they'll get shot cops) visiting doctors (they heard) picking prescriptions (they'll get shot cops). know anything opioid, honestly can't see black americans wod get chance addicted anything. too. church. recognize fix it. I'm even heterosexual I'm queer spectrum. Meanwhile, white nurse died previously stating mistreated white, she’d labelled racist.

The terms “racist” “racism” easily used context people underestimate weight true meaning. unfortunately black people often treated differently. been? “All Lives Matter” people here.

Which really way saying ""I give shit Black lives."" Michigan here. Nice meet you, agree. I'm hearing info can't share, scary. Good luck you. UK really well things considered. many day last year want know real comparison. googled can’t seem find it. weird reason, people like idea murderers rapists getting vaccine everyone else. cannot convince family this. Every year waste much money things need.

it took 20 years convince family this. mother still gets gifts, one else really does. keep it. Missed opportunity start typing Russian scare people. idea prices vaccine? Let’s see, infection rate barely started come down. It’s quite clear yet questions amount testing. 
Hopefully numbers go next month I’m still skeptical. Slightly stronger restrictions would better imo drive numbers lower quickly. Let’s see looks 3 weeks Xmas New Years long allow people things, them. flights available, borders open, people take flights. Yes. 


Source : me. believe proves mistreated based race? course said black women who’s screaming white people trying kill she’s black, else would tell year 2020? say something along lines, like you, media would JUMP persecuting hospital without trial.

But far regular user going around saying ""if carries 2021, care anymore im going parties!!!! I'm wasting another year life""

They sound ridiculous. two people thinking go party got vaccine

I plan definitely expand range activities get vaccinated. eat indoors. might hug friend two. likely go visit family. sure mean, people beyond breaking point. can't go indefinitely risk 0. numbers may accurate can't really hide hospitals full tho. closeted people believe American beer Budweiser food McDonalds.  source that? take emotional toll medical workers even physically ill themselves. civilian ptsd sucks. worry medical workers going though continue go through. get killed covid going need absolutely freakin deserve best mental health care help cope.

Overwhelming hospitals running beds ventalators

It also emotional toll medical workers. want compassionate Dr, nurse dealing loved ones bad things happen, someone cold burnt - plain quit seeing reckless people spread deadly illness broke hearts, one reason everyone take every precaution avoid becoming next patient.

I take precautions save behind, loved ones also medical workers someday something happens still kind compassionate &amp; experienced skilled people job, newbies fresh job covid19 broke killed previous generations medical professionals. Thats poor read. correct statement boiling frog never feels pot slowly heat. overheating around nation. blown past sorts bad landmarks. People knowing truly awful get justify support reasoning statment. Quite minimal. Thanks. I'm planning seeing parents tomorrow close contact anyone recent memory, around people (sealed, recirculating) car walking around night outside people many, many feet away. Regardless I'm pretty paranoid it, probably imagine! vaccine developed quickly, method vaccine created years making allowed create specific vaccine quickly.

Look like this. Guns used many years. Always principle, gun powder ignited sent projectile barrel. worked inaccurate took long time reload.

Then barrel rifling contained bullets invented. made bullets much accurate. instead aiming hoping, rifling allowed aim hit every time. allowed fire repeatedly.

This vaccine first bullet fired rifled barrel cartriged bullet. would make hospitals pay it. generally kind accountability theory, difficult implement.

Smoking sort thing. significant financial costs smoking beyond costs cigarettes. He’s stating percentage believes needed reach herd immunity. doesn’t mean he’s expecting us stay lockdown. No, RN 10 years now, switched Tele ICU 3.5 years ago. note, lovely christmas everybody hope u wonderful tesla stocks trees! is, K also chemical symbol potassium.

Additionally, people flat refuse name contacts, even tracing effort it, would fail flat. people refuse get tests unless really sick, quarantine means lose lot income. government refuses change this, government ""runs country business"" (their slogan) priority save money. Nobody actually wants fight virus anymore.  Yes definitely don’t come arrogant dislike d00mers anyone else really, think going signs potential pandemic coming horizon later, sorely mistaken.

I'm shocked survived long have. Back March, sure I'd dead summer fall yet somehow I'm here. said, takes long vaccine available think be, think I'll still time next year. Yes things:

You need big pharma companies manufacture drugs, plenty CMOs that. Many companies completely outsource piece.

It's fine want NIH conduct trials, let's go see compete private sector. lot potential drug candidates money fund trials - every pharma company pick choose assets fund. suggesting simultaneously ban companies pharma R&amp;D, I'd say serious advancing human health. 

I understand fixation CEO pay, significant contributor costs. Superbowl Florida year and, apparently, Gov. Desantis want's ""full stadium"". Also, Gov.

Everyone likes blame ""dumb Americans"" really leadership anymore U.S. That's actually thing curious aside vitamin supplementation. supplementing April living someone infected, completely asymptomatic despite taking care whole time without form PPE. supplementing D3 K2, wasn't. end really might made huge difference. 10% would blessing SoCal right now. I'm concerned friends ICU's 0% capacity. Like suspected, would run away unable actually respond. It’s sad wish US like China sad wanted complete financial collapse country. guess see financial collapse first toward communist revolution. Meanwhile don’t want people go poverty time put risk COVID. Guess different priorities. care ideology, even pandemic ideology would put people greater risk. care solution actually works protects people. hope time Holiday season reconsider sad views hold. Ideological thinking virus unfortunately won’t vaccinating away. hope conversation help path away toxic thinking. mask mandates reopened. even fabric imperfect fit mask still reduces spread especially others wearing them. Maine one states mandated masks distancing reopened one slowest spike. Yesterday 800 diagnosed, highest ever. many people obey rules kept blowing now. political rallies without masks defiance state mandate CDC rules, wedding Millinocket &amp; associated church outbreaks, halloween, thanksgiving soon Christiams people paying defiance.

summery: governments mandated masks soon opened lock down, half assed not, partial protection better 0%. [This model thinks it’s 19 funny suspect lot people crowd also situation. justification Covid relatively low risk them. also relatively young, known preconditions, work front-lines, know I'm near back line. However, I'm around elderly people (and there's small chance vaccine completely effective them) large gatherings something much something that's embedded normal lifestyle, I'm making sure get vaccinated soon turn. got one 2 hours ago. lifted hoop part mask cut around ear. covering nose mouth whole time. weren’t allowed without one on. doll smoked 3 whole marijuanas. Things get lot worse thanksgiving. seven day average deaths around 1600 thanksgiving around 2600. ""but block 100% everything including aerosols what's point""

This kind black white thinking plagues civilization Nowhere close bad governors New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts. clean 7 years covid. body shutting depression bad. started smoking pot genuinely feel happy alive. Cannabis helping drug ever could surge people sent home instead admitted totaled together actually think year plus elected leaders admonishing citizens - even it’s right thing - gonna cause get replaced covid over. Look happened Churchill. It’s reflexive reaction clean slate. dunno people, me, even watching TV/films pre-Covid era seeing actors screen hugging, kissing, shaking hands, standing close together groups looks alien almost socially improper me.

It's confounding much lost much changed twelve months. goal vaccines administered every primary care office, CVS, Walgreen’s, etc. order everyone jabbed summer. It’s really feasible ambulances standby locations. ambulance standby actually necessary could mean set date back months. gonna say this. wonder mask wearing selected contagious strains. anti-mask one thoughts, virus evolved counter whatever measures use. It’s glib. a) wait next year hope they’re still alive b) meet celebrate Christmas possibly infect family members, they’ll infect friends, that’ll infect community. It’s unfortunate might dead next year, it’s also unfortunate put others risk possible reason chain deaths. yet government can’t help us one bit. Really sad state affairs :( wife touched mine bit, last cut Feb. hair grows freakishly fast. already shoulders (in spots) seeing Chinese government's record transparency course pandemic, trust vaccine government says safe independently verified, start finish, government least shred credibility.  


(Please ban opinion this!) debt owned Americans, new debt directly owned Federal Reserve. neighbor, former nurse, going back administer vaccine giving dose... Lol looking like homeless person initial lockdown March. welcome. happy holiday! would recovered without it, monoclonal antibodies dont really work. According studies. I'm point understand anyone coping without weed 2020, literally every place delivers. There's 20 different antibody epitopes spike protein. immune system produce antibodies injected vaccine. Changing one cause immune escape, need change nearly them. Smoke weed everyday Current science shown spreads person person air transmission, food take out. food local restaurants delivered every day without issue. Hell even Fauci eats take without worry. won’t enough problem warrant restrictions, distancing, masks wide scale. ranges line high income country estimates showed 1.15% (0.78-1.79 95% prediction interval range) high income countries. IFRs lower low income countries (largely due younger population) 0.23% range. Put together get close number range. get dirty Africa roofing contractor house denier. Says masks don’t work &amp; it’s cold anyway. It’s conspiracy, blah blah blah. 
So kept mask distance. I’m tired talking trying convince people. 
Just fuck hope don’t harm. Dallas county. even healthy year olds congregate living. Layman's terms:

When body low vitamin K, mostly uses K make stuff clots blood instead also making anticlotting stuff vitamin K usually helps activate. adequate amounts vitamin, would balanced. think Illinois significantly sunnier West Virginia Wisconsin that's reason death rate double states?

Stop making everything politics... hard people praising governor state significantly higher death rate neighbors. 4 10 people saw 2020 felt, ""you know what? I'd like another round that"" lol remember finally got strep test. discharged doctor 3 said “you’d much pain strep, tonsils would swollen.” screamed “they swollen” literally crying pain. 

I 21yo frat boy douche strep. can’t imagine woman uterine fibroids. cases come Black people terrorized assaulted particularly east Asian countries South Korea China.

Relative United States, Black folks countries still treated much better. many Black people actually shot Korean Chinese police? huge gap insensitive, e.g. local staring you, racism POC faces America. 

You appear defensive racism White America, trying make appear American racism common parts world. White chance? It’s singing. stop singing friends. Clap hymn. Sing together tomorrow. healthcare. situations modeled - many prior data vaccine (ie efficacy) operating 50% efficacy, since baseline assumption approval. 

Depending many parameters - including things don’t know - like vaccine prevent infection symptoms - results best changes wildly. Also depending whether aiming prevent deaths life-years. me, people around globe agree! Wait, mean globe. right one trick use use round numbers math still accurate within acceptable margin error. Back envelop rescue ;) well Happy Birthday Dr Fauci well. right....I've seen first hand negative impact false claims working healthcare, allowing spread gross misinformation like wildfire. infuriating dangerous. What's wrong? say anything wrong. Chinese might help China Europe advanced countries, better options. Even Russian one seems work better. think similar. read aren’t sure origin happened mutate similar way, independent other. get rich keep spending poor. Medicine long list victims. 

When vocal issues get diagnosed condition devalues voice. Uh duh useful information here. Interesting perspective hurry though. Great question, surprised myself. interface patients classified healthcare employee. fair opinion last group. Even gen pop, last work home. I'm introverted even go out. work healthcare administration, part that, guidelines vaccinate much staff possible. Healthcare admin mixed bag many types people, health trainers procurement delivery. There's lot people coming going, since central hub business. Anyway, due internal decisions beyond control interpret guidelines state health services, willing employees get vaccinated even ""just admin"". liability standpoint probably can't pick choose essential isn't. I'm accountant, lawyer. doctors around U.S. isolating babies mother breastmilk birth. hell people still practicing trust anymore?

From study 116 mothers RT-PCR–confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection 120 neonates New York, New York,5 mothers breastfed babies wearing surgical masks practicing careful hand breast hygiene, infants roomed mothers closed isolette. infants negative test results SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic. experience experience look curve USA whole see surge continues rate thanksgiving (with fake dip weekend due reporting issues). surge seems finished peaking. good authority one hoax. hope that’s case.. fingers crossed! slightly positive note, thing gives hope good amount people aware &amp; actively try stay aware.

Even White-Americans *aware* likely anything it, especially benefits them. 

Imagine shortage hospital beds, systematic medical racism increase probability White person assigned hospital bed, Latino person left wait bit longer ""shortages"". many White-Americans willing push equality ones benefiting systemic racism? 

Real change come power wealth America fairly distributed among races. Otherwise, going get nice talk, nothing substances. Buy whatever want long you’re able afford it. 

Economic incentive things like children would simple flipping script taxing people instead children “because cause climate change need get net zero carbon emissions 2030” whatever narrative matches whichever existential threat pimped via corporate media week.

You’re aware places like China legalized restrictions birth, I’m sure. counter argument “it can’t happen here, cos freedom” I’ve got books sell you.

Besides, relatively minor tax credits children don’t exactly amount much relief grand scheme consider children eventually grow start gradually supplant parents tax cattle soon enter job market.

What crux objection even?

You say everything comes back money, must least somewhat aware global monetary order currently fundamentally restructured back declared pandemic, 99% survival rate?

Since said everything comes back money, since privately owned central banks basically create money nothing, money essentially worthless folks private institutions.

There’s scene one Hunger Games films one character mentions protagonist, “I haven’t dealt anything common money years.”

You say rich don’t wanna keep poor down, supposedly doesn’t benefit them, assuming meant financially, socially?

When poor suddenly become poorer, else besides rich inevitably turn solution?

How much powerful make long run?

Have ever wondered else super rich getting abundant leisure time?

They’re definitely running public office, would total demotion. 

They’re sure shit sitting around roundtable discussion maximize freedom liberty prosperity raise townsfolk desperation dependence, would actively devalue power undermine position global superheroes.

So what’s ideology? guiding principles super rich, mostly became super rich due either inheritance simply cutthroat giving fuck stepping little guy?

I know believe seems obvious based simple history, left comment freedom assembly unnecessarily infringed upon, explained done deliberately order force welfare dependence sweet, sticky social control comes with, objected initially continue object without offering substantial elaboration support.

Honestly I’m grateful opportunity discussion, commend resorting insult heat disagreement. I’m even willing bet probably agree part, since you’re probably among .01% probably don’t delight idea authoritarianism.

So yeah, two cents. Ya, eat shit. bats time. Keep telling interesting, thanks again. I'm wondering if, turns vaccine provide immunity, long it'd take manufacture catch before.

I'm sure exactly long would take, would fairly short easy process would start scratch, would make simple modifications existing vaccine. 

Then, guess terms people already vaccinated, would set us back bit. I'm trying remain hopeful vaccine still effective, seems likely be. never said anything losing sense smell. 

No, didn't, context situation. 

The two senses connected. Covid-19, lose senses. Nearly everyone knows this. problem viable alternative. Yeah like 10x sick. girlfriend got way sick second time.

I wonder genetics determines bad outcome disease. possibility, yet unknown. deadlier would burn faster well. right lots problems summer. Houston similar problems Exactly. ""Explain like I'm 5."" get mad care to. Let's get mixed here: vaccines make immune virus. help prevent infections becoming severe.  

Why people want force ""vaccine"" people, vitamin shown effective stopping infections becoming severe? 

You take ""vaccine"", I'll take supplements. Leave career alone. saying day Taco Bell since pandemic hit. eat lot fast food, miss sometimes. Like KNOW Latinos Native/Indigenous people fare poorly also. EVERYONE better Black people better. EVERYONE. told someone else don’t want find uterine fibroids. 

That could horror movie plot. thought min wage raised Wally World year? Yes airborne ebola would need order people wear masks stay home close restaurants would themselves. People feel way something 99% people survive.

What's twisted though way drives people to, like say, wish worse, mean seriously. many people really want us treat like 90% survive. know why, know vulnerable person something? Either maybe commonly they've bought inaccurate doomsday understandings things like [cardiac side always use dosages far small value. say proves vitamin value. lie using enough. vitamin D3 value. PALEO levels vitamin D3 value, like 10,000 IUs per day. Otherwise, useless. Let's get mixed here: vaccines make immune virus. help prevent infections becoming severe.

Work socal factory. average maybe 2-5 people quarantine reasons September November. 25 people out. asked question dude. shitty quora reference useless me. That’s $15 poor people money, case anyone wonders penalties aren’t stopping people whatever want. - strong T-cell activation 
- low adverse effects 
- stable 1 year room temp (not studied manuscript) Right white doctors china india Thank you. wonderful idea. wish connected like lonely nursing home resident. would benefit us. Thanks Read second edit. wish didn’t remember that. ironic number cases lucky number...  Medical racism issue Black folk. doubt Asians treated better. Asian population US small studies include them. 

The problem racism healthcare problem anyone pass White America. certainly limited Black folk. Immigrants citizens too, they? Mate, ""industry"" consists workers. think people working pharmaceutical companies day? Sitting around whipping publicly employed research slaves? won’t even tell story found fibroids... lol(?) cant shit anymore. Im empty! typing error kurva minority providers needed also! Oh that’s funny. second visit painful sore throat life actually drew blood test mono. 


All rapid strep test could diagnosed seconds. tend believe people industries experts. mechanic done dumb shit I've worked long haul drivers fairly well could smoked crack pipe coming work. get home need bucko. start reeling foreign aid take care lost jobs families homes. 

For good example. seem respond tylenol ibuprofen hits spot me. like quiets things makes feel even better painkiller type medicines would. used ibuprofen recover c-section. people get morphine. think depends works. first given percoset work told nurse feeling great. said take ibuprofen really appreciated dismiss someone wanted medicine. keep getting reinfected. know reinfection co-infection, thing know infected 2 strains get pretty bad without O2, steroids, antibiotics. 

Hospitals put forth immense effort thus far, stretch far.   Heard many times years racist medical staff. normal people believe crap. Problem is, still lot racist people working healthcare (well, types work). necessarily need deadlier, visual. Benign oozing green lesions face would effect. doesnt mean anything tho, maybe white peoples crybaby pain, maybe cumulate total prespriction since black peoples minority get less prescription ofc... many factor here, cant believe theres secret nazi cult inside group educated peoples like doctor nurse refuse give painkiller black latino... Nothing said make change mind im srry sound stuborn whatever. Would needing begin anew manufacturing distribution effectively bring us back like, mid-November? Need support diversity doctors too! Haha. it’s available available everyone. don’t want get don’t I’m done shit weeks get vaccinated. 

Everyone else too, btw. know antisocial Reddit fantasy we’re going continue huddling homes staying fifteen feet away people ain’t happenin. Get high horse. 

Also word hunger get replaced food security? Quoting myself: Hurray! I’m happy best resource information new variant Apparently random redditor knows actual scientist doctors making/testing vaccines. It’s actually really annoying could frankly delay people getting vaccinated too, work fit working. already see sub. Sure seems like behavior supremely insecure folks me. Gotta get people validate insanity. shit sherlock ! problem I’m staying put hunkering down. help. happens restrictions enforced, waves Yes!! sad. incompetence prejudice mess. Okay, cool. Thank you.

I hoping spend Xmas least *some* peace mind. I'm smart enough see trouble dumb enough able anything it. Also made 9th grade dropped out. like word fuck like word retarded. go well together, kinda rolls tongue satisfying way. Half population, many countries, take seriously  Thanks. Must I’m mobile won’t let scroll back 3/1/20. 

What exact date? medical professionals: ""there strains vaccine work""

&amp;#x200B;

Media &amp; reddit looking clicks ""Is new strain going kill us all???""

&amp;#x200B;

Getting tired media purposely negative possible many doses go around. Speed necessarily issue here. also 2 weeks everyone figuring best optimize process pull resources from. People experiencing delirium covid triggering psychosis people maybe something look into, saying person wasnt good mind makes wonder outburst prayer. I've warning people, mostly investor friends, Biden announce national lockdown first days office. 
 
This reinforces prediction. Yeah.. that’s going happen. put hand hot surface observe impact skin. scientific experiment.

Except never put hand hot stove already know what's going happen. also faith personally done yet accepted happen? based best educated guess continue happen? sit outside restaurant infected person direct evidence anything. would need study numerous examples build case scientific effect.

You need that. need understanding disease transmission. know virus transmitted. going stop outdoors still close proximity without mask. 

What describing magic, science. Yes, downplayers whining 'fear-mongering'.  Hurts heart hear know this. Indiana trash state. always root sports team coming there. Nice didn’t realize right was, I’m half troll Cali obsessed mode. Looks like there’s even merit now. Ohhh Cali… ‘Weekly random tests’ kinda misleading. family member teaches NYC. announce tests day two beforehand, kids don’t show day, don’t get tested. That’s positivity rate low, since weren’t actually testing students/not students present get test selected. schools closed high positivity rates, actually checking paperwork too. concern understandable. trust vaccines effective, based report authorization use countries like UAE Bahrain. Dude sub becoming hive mind negativity. even subjective thing anymore. Construing headlines literal opposite message article objectively tailoring fear mongering. nonsense. Marijuana drug get high. answer life. Side effect include paranoia, anxiety, confusing, insomnia. Nothing want dealing real situation..

20% get addicted spend years getting stoned day day. complete hoax. Marijuana little medicinal value. think it’s Pfizer ine caused allergic reactions, Moderna one Nice didn’t realize right was, I’m half troll Cali obsessed mode. Looks like there’s even merit now. Ohhh Cali…  never reach that. don’t really care protecting people stupid take vaccine. get immune old fashioned way Youre piece shit scum Earth. Let seep head go sleep night. Go capacity ICU try take care dying patients left right. wouldn’t even last second. nurses still wake go work next day without help much uncertainty. God forbid get sick help YOU.  key point wider spread, mutations occur. virus needs many hosts survive mutate. chain broken providing hosts, slower mutation. Mutation generational. need fewer successful generations get ahead it. It’s bound way that, though... don’t think? 2020 may deserve big fat middle finger Doctor get holiday special! Agreed, going hard media turn around.

They've panic cheerleaders nearly year.

Biden's office next month. wants quick win Covid - people's lives feel normal, fear gone - guys going turn around tanker fear ... that's easy. Um, yes wear masks others get vaccinated. wear long public health experts tell to.

Your emotional outbursts notwithstanding. Seriously, many articles say opposite says. remember article said ""vaccines could rolled public Summer"" said April/May word Summer headline. Associated Press. not.

Having said that, trying draw attention shitty questioning be. Like asking victim sexual assault wearing short skirt.

Due underhanded sly nature racist interactions present day it’s nigh impossible prove them. mean don’t happen mean example wasn’t case. serves purpose berate coming across insensitive insulting. Cool

Now let’s take look owed US wel countries Sitting car someone fits definition close contact. long around someone COVID catch well? giving friend gift apparently exposed COVID. around 1-3 minutes. Shut hell doubting 7% number model

7% model. That's numerous studies seroconversion rates confirmed infected individuals. Around 7% individuals seem seroconvert antibody response SARS-CoV-2. there’s way possibly model without using probable, non PCR confirmed infections may post viral symptoms something else.

The data suspected reinfections comes PCR confirmed results individuals retested positive least 90 days recovering initial infection. noting 12k-43k super wide particularly useful either.

Except not. I'm guessing rather new sort informatics concerning infectious diseases? Holidays home mixed blessing husband I, live 500-ish miles family. However, head home holidays find rushing home home, party party. Rationing time friends family make time next. joyful heartwarming also stressful draining.

This year, we're staying home. pets loving it. We've cooking lovely meals week - roast chicken, prime rib, scratch cinnamon rolls. We've time read books, play video games, get little drunk, watch Christmas movies.

I miss family desperately want give grandmother hug kiss, I'm trying focus cozy lovely stay home relax. Merry Christmas everybody hope able stay healthy safe enjoy cozy moments holiday season I’m opposed lockdowns, feel like matter strict measures take, people disobey point it’s going effective. would livid lost business job due lockdowns.

Not kind Nurse would want. Seems like type might accidently mix meds would go anyway cuz probably kill patient knows, maybe actually right pills. Really? need know Nigerian one? What's dire it? Actually answer that. Really wishing malaysia-type government. Real definition law order I’m hoping someone help, google wasn’t much assistance. know someone covid low O2 levels don’t think vent would good (not sure why) she’s currently hospital talking sending LTC needs much O2. trying figure means. Right she’s getting worse getting better. use sending facility? area vent short, kids worried sending die, thoughts? important note top med professionals stated around 70% Completely agree. Thats caveat. Theres way treat safely  ventilation? goal fear paranoia, always been, yes street decked giant Santas 
 think people jobs saved ton money. eating out, little shopping, cooking home concerts, museums, movies travel. friends paid bills. idea much spending before. nothing else showed least little restraint pockets! know two people died FL suddenly (25 y/o 63 y/o) autopsies showed myocarditis, yet idea tested Covid not. Also, 2-3 month delay getting long form death certificate cause death yeah hearing deaths happened months ago. good see non-Chinese assessments COVID-19 vaccines. Sinovac one, confused Sinopharm one, reported 86% effectiveness according United Arab Emirates spokesperson. use de-activated whole virus. Looking forward seeing data. Everything works together optimum results- masks, distance, sanitizing, good ventilation. Vietnam War able this? Fuckin 'media' outlets trying capitalize hysteria clicks. kind shit counter productive *sigh* Seasons Greetings everyone

Have Merry Christmas Happy New Year ^(as best can)   

Live Long Prosper 🖖 ambulance standby.

What mean, one staged every vaccine administration center? Yeah that's going complicate distribution. used CDC weekly covid stats (spreadsheet). split earlier time period. saying you’re looking data suggest mortality rate 65 year old person covid, someone 80+? That’s curious I’m seeing that.


But let’s take step back look big picture here. isn’t enough vaccines right include everyone 65. That’s 53 million Americans. vaccinate 80 older, need 9-10 million doses (x 2). US struggle get enough supply cover 20 million Americans.

In perfect world would enough supply vaccinate everyone, year end. local Taco Bell Uber Eats, wife feeling it, either, even though I've gotten urge times.

I'm willing go drive-thru it, though. people I've encountered Taco Bell drive-thru pandemic inspire confidence would precautions taken pandemic (I'm saying someone worked drive-thru fast food restaurant first job, still tried give shit). IM deltoid injections super easy learn super easy give. flu clinic nursing school spent day giving flu vaccines. IM injections usually taught first 2nd semester nursing school.

There's also bunch nurses non clinical roles pulled give shots. lady first dose quality improvement nurse sits behind desk days. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* efficacy effectiveness almost par MMR vaccine.. individual, still hurt kill them.

As lot things world. Prepare disappointed. People realize actually still lot ""gold hills"". still many gold mining panning operations people summer. one shot one clarify bit everyone complaining ""should"" language.

You're never going get scientist say anything stronger there's enough data (which probably need wait there's cases vaccinated folks getting B.1.1.7 strain large number disprove hypothesis work).

The reality - spike protein b.1.1.7 largely identical. vaccines work it, would pretty much entire virology community (example - say pretty much, even though rally believe all) absolutely shocked. Well done sensible ones. followed excellent example “Avid nose picker” might funniest role title I’ve ever heard. EARTH slowing spread slow mutations? know nothing viruses Youyang Gu’s best estimates put total number infected way higher confirmed he’s consistently right now-casting data. take deaths divide estimated infections get 0.4%. CDC’s estimated IFR pandemic planning scenario age stratified IFRs put much lower 1.15 anything 1%. 

The much likely scenario head counting cases hard older countries outbreaks noise makes p values hard hell narrow. Whereas Cameroon Somalia, you’ve got handful old people died wi virus million kids. Makes pretty damn easy get consistent IFR estimate. 

This best estimates “somewhere twice much that”. blended approach good estimates provides narrower window. Fauci took moderna. that's plan get one. Yeah. mask use main purpose, also stop touching face.

And really worked far. need touch face, use sleeve shirt. COVID dangerous enough annual circulation similar flu acceptable

The danger stacked heavily towards people 40 over. demographic heavily vaccinated danger presented par flu.  Around last Monday started realize neck, back shoulders extremely sore. like pulled bunch muscles neck something. hurt look left right. thought hey lot hunch phone reading bed instead laying back. stiffness pain went away largely Monday really think it, happened (not bad) past practice good posture. extremely uncomfortable though doubt.

Two days ago find we're full-blown covid outbreak facility since last week earlier. one notified time. went got tested yesterday I'm still waiting results. confirmation message got immediately following test via email lists ""stiff neck"" cause immediately seeking emergency medical assistance. get weeds I'm doctor pretty concerning.

Let clear something shun mask usage convinced important cover fucking airways eyes:

Maybe one two people seen face last nine months distance less 20 ft. using 9502 FFP2 NR masks KN95 masks months. real ones. imitation shit knockoffs, personally identified returned almost $150 worth counterfeit PPE. Real ones five layers still completely face (well mine anyway). wear surgical mask good masks. swap PPE every 4 hours. Anything worn 4 hours gets carefully folded put plastic bag quarantined home large paper grocery bag. Friday paper grocery bag sealed write date 3 weeks Friday bag. 

On kn95, ffp2 surgical masks I've spent $1,000 co-workers, $200 close fitting anti fog goggles co-workers well. mix isopropyl alcohol 75% spray bottles, everything touch gets covered alcohol supplied six co-workers spray bottles refilled charge. work deployed medical grade HEPA filtration machines office clean combined total 700 sq. ft. air every 30 minutes run full blast times performed filter changes early exactly instructed. home use medical grade HEPA filtration machines every room clean combined total 1100 sq. ft. air every 30 minutes, also immaculately maintained. 

I wear disposable gloves everywhere touch face ever. get close anyone ever unless they're wearing much headgear lol. Oh live I've sealed nooks crannies apartments building best metal backed duct tape buy including attic pipes hot/cold water two sink drains. identify areas walked apartment thermal camera spot points unit may exchanging air tenants areas building. example lot air rushing attic hatch around pipes mentioned, areas appeared much cooler, upon closer inspection could feel much air coming through. air smelled like weed cigarettes, anyways yeah months since I've sharing air like that, smoky smell homies units.

Two co-workers mine describing exact phenomenon intense stiffness neck back area, one already seen doctor decided must back injury prescribed muscle relaxers work 10 days. I'm doctor know fucking thing, humble opinion reason believe level exposure (meaning size infectious dose SARS 2 Coronavirus) appears proportional severity symptoms likelihood may need seek immediate medical care.

I know anyone else gone lengths attempt remain uninfected. fact receive positive test result almost certain contracted virus work.

Props reading far thank have. fucking point? point this: test positive conclude size inoculum undoubtedly small side, whoever's breath actually infected would present immediate environment extremely small amount. Think get close personal fucking asshole wearing mask chin diaper, basically think twice leaving eyes nose mouth exposed. even smallest dose disease getting high quality five layer mask (that supposedly 94% efficient) enough mimic pain stiffness moderate back injury, abandon fucking hope mean fucking hope going let someone breathe stupid face. Also one chin diaper enthusiasts nothing anyone says we'll convince piece shit see Darwin awards. 

The rest you: world needs you. Keep trying maybe even try little harder, too. Ive seeing lot Christmas lights year Thanks! 👍

So far side effects mild soreness point entry someone trains nursing students - well within scope practice, even first year learn give intramuscular injection arm, arm muscle easy landmark. Nope. I’d bet amount money won’t. Peak reddit million, appears compare weekday last year, exact date, sort make sense.

Appointments available every 10 minutes. They've completely booked. Stop moving goalposts. Small businesses subset *everything*, *everything* *closed indefinitely*. 

Your words, mine. Hard say exactly, I'd guess combination higher population (Florida maybe 2/3 population LA county), higher density CA, [lower ICU beds per (50% beds FL). Mostly undeveloped developing nations. fo both. Maybe Congress legalized federal level. it’s still illegal whole country including states legalized it. aren’t going get covid food, it’s transmission airborne. contact surface Covid zombies due respect, guys put way much faith party question. first new COVID variant pandemic? timing seems way perfect media. know they're losing grip vaccinations, better new variant scare people with?

So first new variant? will. won’t. Don’t hire Cant imagine third. Hopefully shes ex con... Lmao what? Yeah, fuck things right now. Unfortunately casinos owned Indians, government can’t anything it. believe issue deciding gets doses.

Bullshit.

If so, falls category 2. Start arresting people. we're weeks in, firm advice already given subject, hospitals wringing hands 'who give to' giving nobody instead. Start arresting people hospital gross negligence. Pardon me, meant infectious dose. also may reduce severity due reduced innoculum. American problem, societal problem.

Society includes government. People bottom take cues top. Stop making excuses historically incompetent administration. I'm pretty sure interstate transit, parks, public licenses affected, I'd guess taxi services public dining require well.

Schools, conferences, many workplaces will, however, I'm pretty sure. I'm undecided flights.

In Germany, sure that, likely even many healthcare settings. Ah, Lancaster. wife I, several months ago, considered moving there, intrigued cheap real estate is. looked crime stats, realized move Lancaster guarantee murdered. Yeah know it’s total I’m trying one good guys defy orders etc I’m wondering say, 30% vaccinated result infection rates easing significantly. Get purple trot etc No, actually around since 1980's (!). first DNA vaccines trigger strong immune response. That's RNA vaccines started. using smaller RNA molecules, could easily penetrate cells membrane. downside RNA molecules less stable require deep freezing.
Others, like Inovio, continued using DNA molecules.They use electroporation open cell membranes, DNA molecules enter cells. Like RNA approved vaccines yet, exactly new. LA far harshest lockdowns.... What's source? again, lose 50,000 year drug overdoses, never seemed make national emergency be

Typically people concerned worried ailments illnesses 1) self inflicted 2) communicable. Ugh. right.

Yep, cardiac issues 35% diagnosed covid. going fun long term. medical professional? Becuase seem silly trying argue one things done forget /s tag? needed smile Elgin IL[Elgin self help guru paying $250,000 / year.  


This looks like money grab employee playing victim. Mutation new black Casino OK , Church bad ?  forgot Yemen schools gave many options parents involved kids come back. begged us keep kids home could. 80% student body initially went back person hybrid. first exposure first day. end week 4, 5 district. district 1100 kids spread 5 buildings. lost middle school 11 weeks year. 85% staff ill quarantine. 4 weeks later, entire district closed. Test positivity within district 40%. schools insisted following protocols imagine could happened. Parents buy it, kids return break, looking less 30% going back person second semester. Pandemics tend operate linear scale. put risk, likely already got infected summer waves virus hit Florida hard. 75% spread driven 10% people, large portion 10% already infected, difficult second wave happen. 

California saw rise summer per capita anything like Florida did. seeing massive surge '10%' talked active spreading virus everywhere. again, pandemic waves go forever, California eventually see decline, likely soon. Hopefully soon. 

The alternative theory? UK strain there. cruise ship land Send videos COVID victims cute think that. parking lots absolutely jam packed Christmas shoppers last two weeks. even thinking employees, legal liability created employers fired. 2021 STD outbreak lol Ha. Good reference. ""jab"" British thing? Slasher Danger Comet Blitz-er Full vs partial. 50% slow spread stop it.

If R0 6 ( high end estimates ) 85% need immunized reach it. new strain UK approximately 50% infectious puts R0 possibly high 9, tickling heals measles requires 90%+ vax rate prevent outbreaks. never thought reddit could therapeutic. amazing. yeah narrative come from? 100%. gotten half vaccines available (one two candidates) half effectiveness, would still incredibly good news. hangups (special freezers, multiple doses effectiveness) rapidly overcome also. worry distribution messaging. single case can't draw conclusions verify hypothesis, time investigation case tell. totally make sense .It part crazy response Government start year. article read quoted data says variant detected September using data November able calculate relative spread. sure took till December notify WHO, maybe data wasn’t available recently Jfc. gonna take going take. Constantly speculating number everyday pointless Well, immunity 35% 1/3 Americans infected Spanish Flu...so, point likely wrong. wonder we'll get something bit official second dose Wow... really wouldnt like NHS dealing surge capacity... street parties yet! vaccinated it. it’s not. propaganda machine working. virus originated China. UK strain may originated else first sequenced UK. situations. first cases covid Wuhan. don’t understand become point contention. Sure was.

I actually boat!

Was exposed week ago, guy tested positive... didn’t find yesterday.

No symptoms, negative test... Go figure.

Viruses weird. wonder get axed ya know... it’s posted dozen times 

Or comments ask questions intent I'm sure mean viral load. 

\- define viral load virons per mL. estimate viral load per mL snot, spit, sputum PCR Ct value done PCR test. PCR test measures number RNA copies, whether viable. most, couple days symptoms start virons actually dead PCR still measuring ashes. know infectious people likely throat get high 9log/mL. 

\- define viral load virons per host. guess could take Ct sampled fluids multiply size person, etc...

\- defined viral load \*viral dose\*. incorrect terminology common enough usage. theory, know many diseases transmitted little \*ONE\* viron. know genomic variance bottleneck studies early covid days outbreaks austrian alps, often seeing many 100s virons transmitted person person. likely getting blasted (particulary early pre-mask days) hundreds droplet nuclei starting hundreds independent colonies ""foci"" within respiratory tract overwelm victim get dozen ""foci"" mild symptoms.

We know large airborne spread events, presymptomatic people emitting 200-300 infectious doses per hour (google Wells Riley model details). 1/3 transmissible air measles. Fundamentalist christians death cult. give shit human life - care political control everybody else. wash week smell back. 😋😄 large portion Western countries better functioning safety net programs. US, struggled work pandemic. example, look Florida's unemployment system. supposed work people paid in. Except many people waited months benefits kick in. month. still slightly altered months later. Certain foods taste same, particularly creamy rich foods, butter, etc. Interesting. understand - last months shown us this? four thousand person party, it’s fear mongering say it’s bad idea. Damn. powerful commercial. given cdc website sign track symptoms. /r/NoahGetTheBoat people still wearing vented masks, need fined punished. definition making okay letting another hundred thousand people die needlessly. Looking housing prices. bought house $100,000 five years ago bank gave someone 100K let make payments them. Now, 5 years later I'm willing pay $200,000 it. borrow 200k bank, give 100K bank owe 100k you. (I'm keeping numbers oversimplified really change result).

Now, bank 100k back ""interest"" paid loan profit. 100k owe bank 200k.

Yes new bank larger loan really extra 100k pocket. cases owner property real beneficiary price increases. bank going make larger profit, twice much cash (capital) risk.

There factors play (i.e. [Nominal vs Real / inflation). hope makes sense, questions; let know. don’t understand herd immunity? People get vaccine still immune, right? There’s fucking way 90% country getting vaccinated. still think it'll eventually like four known human coronaviruses. exposed child (most people), it'll like cold on. Unless immune compromised, old, recovering another pneumonia (all situations four coronaviruses occasionally troublesome). speculated four coronaviruses crossed humans, caused similar pandemic faded background immune systems primed deal them. IIRC vaccinations Palestinian population.

[**Palestinians left waiting Israel set deploy COVID-19 Ridiculously late. suspected. back fucking line. always support else fails.

When else fails.

When dumb shit hurt ourselves, toys tools break harm us that's for. 

Important remember long haul unfortunately. Think long long term marathon. can, ounce more. mean physician heal thyself. 

To use sports analogy, okay miss throw avoid breaking leg. One play worth losing whole game. survival rate among people get admitted hospital? country vaccinations US far point? Last saw, US one million people vaccinated 10 million doses ready. UK 600,000. European Commission approved vaccine vaccinations given. Guess aren’t priority unfortunately 🤷‍♂️ believe issue deciding gets doses. Everyone’s afraid next scandal giving administrators people shouldn’t first line. don’t know saying THIRD OPTION. plenty possibilities. Regardless I’m completely infuriated aren’t vaccinating quickly possible. think vaccinate 75% doses count second doses time they’re needed. We’re getting 10 million week. could vaccinate 10 mill people week knowing they’ll 10 mill vaccines three weeks. need many given quickly possible. It’s absolutely infuriating  Yet still power enforce police powers states. projections, exactly going get ""herd immunity"" initial wave vaccinations need annual booster?

I feel like we'll wearing masks long time. stop trolling too. already diet losing weight, pandemic definitely sped up.

I think case 40% reduced access tempting foods, 45% isolation-induced depression, 5% ""Ooh! look delicious... I'd take mask eat, thanks!"" I've Vegas 3 times multiple local casinos state since reopened. sub like hear this, casinos safer average Wal-Mart point.

None wal-marts cart cleaning anymore limiting many people enter. Meanwhile, casinos I've mandatory temperature checks, strictly enforce masks and, soon get machine, someone clean up.

Now get downvoted since sub prefers fear mongering anything positive. Yeah, it’s basically virus orgy.  post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Will never win title team employs said forever wet sock same, except thinking absolutely would happen getting called fearmonger sub saying so. Normally love proven right things. doesn't... covid sucks fun everything majority Americans even remedial grasp US constitutional law. Denmark's first case mid-November (zero evidence Denmark before) there's nothing suggests surging Denmark all.

Depending list use, Denmark highest sequencing rate Europa, highest world, mid-November mid-December represents less 0.5% sequenced cases. rare Denmark. Unless rather frequent Germany, entirely unsurprising detected now. They're sequencing around 0.08% cases. Denmark sequencing 10%. Thank response. assuming two variants together really cause many problems ""regular"" Covid. good. Anecdotally, caught one strain flu back back, second strain supposed much less severe (I got H1N1 influenza type generic Influenza Type B), second round made feel much worse already worn first time. Allergic reactions side effect vaccines. Humans allergic nearly anything. may RNA people reacting may chemicals injected it.

Allergies expected. believe majority people history allergies. Sure may bit expected it’s nothing worry about.....also vaccinated around 22,000 people trials. sample size increased significantly. shit happening Casinos across country. DARE bring common sense ya know... reading ... page  People stupid.

The businesses control airlines.

The government controls airports borders. Cool one’s saying recently. seemed like reasonable hypothesis summer herd immunity kicked relatively low level due people shun masks, interact public regularly work, attend parties, etc. disproportionately already infected immune. Supporting idea time place 20% higher seroprevalence (NYC around 25%) according antibody surveys seen kind second wave. 

But know idea true many epidemiologists said along. part reason misleading picture summer may seasonality, play important role initially immunity built seen flu pandemics. evidence less virulent, would follow contagious would lead infections would otherwise occurred, therefore would also lead hospitalizations. less deadly scenario may eventually come play virus' mutations, guarantee, evidence thus far suggests virus lacks pressures would lead less deadly mutation becoming advantageous virus' survival. example; low baseline immunity, virus seems spread stages infection instead symptomatic, asymptomatic people seem also able spread people staying symptomatic actively infected long periods time. also relatively low lethality rate could likely increase percent without significantly changing people's behavior. prone allergies vaccinations, would worry anyways. less western countries done everything. Judgement people state. 

There alot clashing state people regulation. seem countries. recently constantly last 100-200 years. 

They wont take hard fist approch like China Russia, firm approch Korea, Japan, etc.

Its always like this. note western countries way work allow voice opinion agains them. cant countries mandate everything.

Cause first commenter said one cheek... reminded picture saw someone got ""W"" tattooed cheek; everyone would say ""WoW"" bent naked... think people seen picture. I’ll bite. Yes brand new, 6 months come air tight plan.

What instead? realize would take days FDA approved quality assurance checks. government distributors realizing government regulators rules slow distribution. Thats pretty god awful 6 months prep time.

But fine, days delay. Ok whatever.

Well, what? vaccines going hospitals, hospitals keep fucking gets them. Stanford going give admin managers. radio today nurses talking registration system got released appointments filled shift. people working working office jobs signed hospital honor system. wife got shot last friday. sunday send blast saying 90 left body could sign up. Well thats following tier system.

Brand new doesnt mean get pass working well right bat. 

I think expected chaos distribution, government promised us perfection fair complain.

Hopefully figure soon ready 2 months ago anyone die needfully? intense DeSantis's effort HIDE COVID data? weeks/months behind actual totals
Florida’s public tally COVID-19 deaths behind days, nearly half deaths reported actually occurred two months earlier, public health data shows.
The backlog blurs full impact disease, preventing Floridians seeing deeply it’s ravaging state.
On 14 days December far, daily death count reported state included deaths 60 days old, according data analyzed Florida public health scientists. trend continues, Floridians won’t see potentially deadly effect Thanksgiving gatherings New Year’s. won’t know full scope COVID deaths resulting Christmas parties Valentine’s Day. Strength pots sharks cover us rest way Also Vietnam, extensive land border China. Lots mask staying good. keep well-hydrated eat nutritious food get plenty rest, that's best thing home. thermometer, could take temperature times day. oximeter, could monitor oxygen level. Almost always correlates live higher you’re paid generally COL also much higher. say why, why?

Tell it’s human nature

Why, COVID us way? I've thinking lot. reasons numbers seem pretty subtle. example, San Francisco ~70 mi away city. higher population density, older median age, similar politics policies. . .and 5X less deaths per capita?

I think likely reason one. totally homogenous population model random infections people randomly interacted neighbors, virus would likely concentrate areas chance given certain parameters.

I think reasonable hypothesis level precaution necessary prevent uncontrolled spread depends prevalence virus. threshold precautions (cloth masks, 6ft, etc.) sufficient prevent exponential growth given frequency people exposed.

Now imagine area threshold concentration infected people. get sick. could push area exponential growth, *but spread virus there*. stay home. numbers area decline away threshold now. could also gone way. applies every scale. people shop one grocery store threshold, city threshold made sum smaller groups interacting people, whole state cities, etc. Essentially, uncontrolled spread depends handful people making wrong decisions wrong places times push population threshold.

I think conditions necessary uncontrolled spread, like maybe certain population density. guarantee uncontrolled spread. Better compliance safety protocols raises threshold, guarantee control. Florida could simply lucky now.

That's take using experience studying complex systems. People really want find reasons things, might kind system like asking one gust wind bigger another. hallmarks complex system would defy people's linear expectations cause effect. could also see sudden declines numbers. dip beginning every politician take credit for, maybe credit undeserved. might Rt numbers actually go chaotic.

Practically, would say place high enough population density could next. Every day we're rolling dice crossing thresholds. add obvious variables like testing reporting differences, demographics, local culture, weather, different virus variants, etc. Figuring numbers one place differ another seem straightforward case. I'm sick, I'll keep distance. Common courtest. need mask that.

And preventing colds flu - potential permanence mask mandates long COVID exists wild.

Spoiler alert: COVID still year 2100. Another way look 18 million healthcare workers US adult population 328.2 million. 5.5% total population healthcare workers.

So literally better 95% rest us amounts nothing. 

Less nothing anti-mask crowd.


On personal level, hang take care first, always. honestly think new strain what’s ravaging California already, US doesnt sequencing prove population US 5x larger UK. aren’t enemies. ridiculous. COVID data released daily based data 1-2 weeks ago longer. Sun-Sentenial ran article bout today Illinois breaks data county. confirm this. wife got better. We’re physicians. biggest fear. Well, that, healthy people 65 *allowed* get one good vaccines. 😬

Maybe that’s unlikely America.. it’ll hard prove I’m healthy good vaccine unless I’m required produce doctor’s note. doubt government would want burden doctors businesses that. We’ll see. Even lift lines get crowded (they theoretically spaced year every mountain going enforce that), it’s still least outdoors everyone masked up. 1/6 need mechanical ventilation, 1/2 die. I’m shocked common sense comments like I’ve reading sub today. Almost feels like dam broken.  Impossible predict sounds like she'll monitored, friend who's 70 who's pneumonia five times year, needing hospitalized. went NorCal last year loved it. joking?

Or cleverly sarcastic point weak US’s general response been? 

I live LA didn’t read it, wouldn’t know lockdown ever happened; don’t even know we’re type lockdown right now. recently major 7 strains. Fauci 80 years old...totally touch young people expecting comply advice mandates. It’s actually foolish. 80 year old hasn’t 20 sixty years can’t empathize understand makes demographic tick (which isn’t social distancing masking thinks there’s covid). Basically means UK really screwed really is. planned seeing family. socially distanced thanksgiving. 13 year old family member attempted kill ended seizures hospital 4 days. came see I'm staying family Christmas helping child care, working talk it. I'll bringing grand mothers week right Christmas.

It sucks. None us wanted feel guilty travel lack lot precautions. mental health matter. isnt ""feeling sad"". life death. People upset restrictions use mental health excuse want. keeps many people prolonging effects pandemic. serious consideration decisions make. eosinophilic esophagitis

Don't care. lots allergies

Time drum. could Turkey different contract Brazil Sinovac request delay announcement? Sounds like treatment vaccine too, could still useful point. Hope still looking it. ""I understand covid nasty little virus, believe numbers,"" wrote Twitter earlier month. ""I heard person today run car, cause death listed ....... yep, covid.""

Normal people taking masks seeing friends/family, returning work school. context tracers want keep that, fine me. Maybe someone run car Yup, summed thoughts perfectly. pandemic, trade-offs made - saying get together in-person Christmas “mental health!” doesn’t cut could spreading virus leads people drowning mucus. Back line? literally second nation approve receive vaccine. even talking about.

You bought narrative didn’t you? well, 50% would acceptable long completely protect pneumonia.. Part thinks able beat someone shit tell wear mask tell off. know that's barbarism, short-sighted assholes making soooo much worse gets me. :( curiosity... would willing wear mask whenever cold future?

I mind became post-COVID norm see extremely rude go without mask cold. cold kill me, make miserable make miss work income. law, future plan respond people go maskless sick way respond people wear deodorant. Therapeutic vaccines viral diseases commonly done (only cancer immunotherapy BCG bladder cancer) vaccines meant prophylactic prevent disease first place. want increase NAbs, better giving patient directly convalescent plasma recombinant monoclonal antibodies rather indirectly vaccine takes time create antibodies (around two weeks peak titer usually).

I know recommended protocol vaccine administration actively infection, like giving someone flu vaccine fighting flu. case think TDAp vaccine given anti-vaxer kid treating severe tetanus know time course treatment kid given vaccine.

Vaccine-resistant viral strains rare complicated equivalent observed antibiotic resistance. still see large reduction disease even vaccine resistant strains detected. review paper reading think describes reasons resistant pathogen strains might still evolving spreading, thus requiring time fully erode benefits vaccination. Second, vaccine-resistant strains might never fully replace vaccine-sensitive pathogen strains, example, due high fitness costs, competitive interactions, heterogeneity selection among hosts geographic locations. Third, vaccine resistance might incomplete, example, degree protection persists vaccine-resistant strains. Finally, mechanisms vaccines protect disease (pathology) often differ protect infection transmission I’m aware everything said, agree. find sad. best save people. Please let crushed thanks way public handling crisis. Back line? literally second nation approve receive vaccine.

Keep buying ridiculous conservative narrative. keep lying, 60% effective enough heard immunity, help prevent hospitals filling up.

It also nothing reduce total amount people needing two doses, single dosers still need two doses road given proper schedule. Dude literally done far country reporting delay. America actually good things, like producing Moderna vaccine Perfectly said. agree! really hoped country essentially ran people believe invisible sky daddy. guess that's much hope for... Reverse UNO card played. happen logically happening right world. hit 10 mill deaths bet people start wearing masks. Even doesn’t kill you, leave lung, heart organ damage.  2 million *official* cases. 

Texas run 15,000,000 fewer tests. Wow, thats even option plague inc! Achievement unlocked get Chinese government caught spending money trying paint racist narrative absolve taking responsibly causing pandemic, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Blaming random Chinese people street racist, holding accountable corrupt government open Quebec. Well maybe tonight, that's rain, covid.  Ho-Ho-Homicide Well, guess since many Americans raise heart rate regular basis, they're going care heart stays inflamed months afterward, endangering heart attack.  get embarrassed, quit it. one support single doses nothing reduce total amount people still needing two doses.

60% meaningless, enough heard immunity, virus still spread. Good bad, disappointing considering years experience expertise. Imo there’s proof unnecessary out-of-state international travel, people back line get sick. ICUs full decisions need made reminds southwest uses random boarding pattern it’s mot efficient haha. yes specific groups allowed make things complex FL would allow UN inspectors I’d trust numbers. Yeah called “metadrama” huge overreaction. Everyone high risk catching it. wife, late 20 fit healthy, got two days ago work overnight shift.

Hopefully stay January, given situation think going worst month have. much want spending, agree you, think Elvis polio vaccine. probably important government program recent memory. actually really astounding got done, get done, put resources political it.

There lot problems country solved desire put sort effort it. makes sense. mutations guarantee results less potent. genetic roll dice whether nothing, something worse host reduces severity. Also gives chances mutate enough evade people previous infections potentially reduce vaccine effectiveness totally evade it. experts quoted articles read concerned possibilities.

while maybe trueism virus tend come less potent time guarentee happen without variants making worse like 1918 flu preceded one mostly killed elderly previous year come back '18 killing young healthy.

I gamble general goes double health. Magic - ""Believing disease transmission occur non-socially distanced individuals wearing masks seated dining table outdoors."" big deal supplanted original variant dominant form areas UK. clear evidence variant advantage one terms transmissibility, least region world. cause concern, panic, vaccine still seems effective it. However, countries tracking virus genome well UK, could well many variants around world may may evade vaccine. one wants lockdowns. Politicians want things opened up. Even people take virus seriously want things opened soon possible. world would locking things “political reasons?” even give K babies! Ketamine jokes aside, prevents (very rare) disorder cause brain bleeds resulting brain damage even death. 
  Source 7% numerous studies going back initial outbreak Wuhan show similar you’re counting people who’ve tested positive twice 90 days?

Technically, purposes, counting people tested positive twice 90 days symptomatic. consider asymptomatic second infection ""protected,"" similar vaccine potentially likely turn mostly people immunocompromised, extremely young, things think taking account reinfection possibility average person?

Nope. We're talking largely middle aged men women otherwise healthy. even including extremely young dataset (as there's enough data them). immunocompromised second infections far between. I’m open understanding number number 3.5x higher number wide taken seriousness.

We're talking confidence intervals small numbers within 50 different states. leads larger confidence intervals. look estimate flu cases year CDC/medical visits/hospitalizations/deaths.  Even large numbers like work with, confidence intervals around that. even smaller set data work with, confidence intervals 3.5x unheard negate data. mom got vaccinated moderna yesterday consider heading public, imagine explaining nurse contracted COVID.

CDC hasn’t updated pandemic planning scenarios since September, third wave proven larger deaths shorter period time.

How define wave? Also show wave we’re deadly shorter time? US went ~5 deaths March 100k May. We’ve gone 230k deaths October 330k December. think line experienced before, least don’t think people dying particularly faster. much likely get accurate count high income country poor country simply resources.

Not testing completely nonexistent high income countries months in. age deaths hid true cause lack testing period. Poorer countries are, universally, young. aren’t counting deaths covid resources yes, they’re also counting they’re happening. low number deaths high number cases leads larger confidence intervals...not smaller. Sample size small leads larger confidence intervals. difference high income low income countries terms confidence interval (or prediction interval) reflection differences high income countries responses mitigate deaths.

I get lack deaths means widen confidence interval, look staggering lack death sub Saharan Africa (and rest 3rd world) due virus. number low estimate IFR Imperial College provided actually within narrower window high income countries. Despite lack testing. Despite lack reporting. Despite mitigation. 

So yeah, IFR noisy cases, it’s noisy 0.3 3rd world countries like 1.3 1st world countries. That’s important reason too.

Further, Israel blocks crucial medicine treatment meant coronavirus infected people Palestine. 

They also forcibly closed testing centres.

Yeahhhh ... awesome nation Israel is. always true wider spread mutations? possible deeper spread longer time might significant mutations.

I'm sorry, rational response data longer option 2020. much choose panic, ignore attack it. day. I’ve always able walk close going early. think flying New York see tree vacation pandemic disrespectful. Stay home people. vaccines reduce infections transmission, full evidence generated Covid yet, though early data Moderna promising.

In case, vaccines very, good preventing severe symptoms, currently believe mildly symptomatic asymptomatic cases bad spreading, compared severely symptomatic cases. contact tracing study found asymptomatic cases infected 0.3% close contacts, mild cases 2%, severe cases 6%. (Note asymptomatic pre-symptomatic, people stay symptom-free throughout rarely infectious, went severe symptoms infected higher percentage contacts felt perfectly well.) /r/COVID19/comments/iccj85/contact_settings_and_risk_for_transmission_in/ I’ve reading peoples covid positive stories family members calling irrational rage fits. I'm going immediately go hard you, term herd immunity incorrectly used pandemic. 

So, here's herd immunity works:

You 100 people. 90 get vaccinated.

That makes hard 10 infect other, rest populace.

That's able keep things like polio measels/mumps/rubella spreading (and got resurgences USA anti vaxxers).

Here Wikipedia herd immunity, recommend seek sources learn it:

[Herd Immunity So? Nothing wrong going vaca leaving toddler home. personally kid safe hands okay. apparently. life complicated confusing would start making pointless comments regarding matters didn’t understand. Thankfully work going continue honor it. low pay public service finally paying pandemic. seemed lot people receiving first place, kept seeing people local sub trying get same-day Covid test going without pay work. Article UK. nicer me. would called fuck contribution health crisis told stupid party going kill people. Taking load let’s see archive come rescue yet also, longer 1 person sick chances mutate. California residents fcking arrogant. small amount still expected reads like virtue signaling. Yes, “death suffering” isn’t uninformed distributed among age bands.

If vaccinate 20% vulnerable probably decrease deaths suffering 80%, something like 80% covid deaths age 75. 

If covid killed 60,000 Americans since March instead 300,000 .... would taking precautions right now. would gathering Christmas “social distancing” would thing cautious us. 

All say, “death suffering” always happen. 60k lives lost still 60k suffering families..... it’s enough shut world economy thus, probably allow us go back normal. I'm really curious link antibody tests positive pcr non-antibody tests. asymptomatic positives reach level immunity still risk? 

I fear people received positive test forgo vaccine vulnerable well vector continued infection. CFR anaphylaxis 0.25 0.33%.

So, higher odds dying covid according source showing .12% IFR covid age group. hope they’re vaccinated go public hospital, treatment free. like following WWII bear brunt higher taxes years come pay debt. fine gradations gets vaccine priority sound fine theory...but think could easily slow overall rollout vaccine. hate see leaders fail utilize science make proper policy see break trust politician spread towards general distrust scientific community U.S. 18.5 million confirmed cases tested. first confirmed cases 9 months ago. U.S. hit 1 million confirmed cases 8 months ago. U.S. hit 3 million cases sometime beginning July.


So less 6% population tested positive, less 1% tested positive 5 months ago would seeing massive reinfection anyway? tell you, serious car accident tomorrow, needed critical care locally hospital 30% full covid-19 70% full non-critical care/elective patients, air transported elsewhere, would incredibly pissed. 

I recall seeing comment r/StLouis last month hospitals **Colorado** asking STL area hospitals beds. Let tell you, would HUGE air ambulance bill... Granted one comment internet, take grain salt, people needing transported hospitals much away home due overcrowding situations.

It’s true geography strain far Anti vaxxers make least 15% people probably want people take vaccine need perceived benefit, people low risk groups may bother believe enough return normal. convinced take vaccine updating threshold make change opinion. quick happy holiday wish, (like many us America) tough times please reach out.

Most importantly let's look forward 20 21 getting vaccines! (27M) hope i'm part statistic get virus tonight. Lucky far. elderly mother grandma want desperately spend time grandkids badly today.

The article suggest COVID cause worsen vitamin K deficiencies, actually result vitamin k necessary preserve lung elasticity. COVID fighting lungs part body, possible reserves used save lungs. causation backed data article even peer-reviewed, would take everything grain salt. But, right, administration vitamin k \*might\* provide lot benefit. think article front page yesterday suggested something similar vitamin D. developed countries increasingly urbanised. Ever hear “food deserts?”

I seriously doubt idea would option many people.

It kind reminds people take hunting fishing ‘save money.’

Perhaps that’s possible some, especially lot, people probably spend lot money getting ‘free food.’

I knew wealthy people; wife drunkard. would rail working people/staff “just hand out,” taking holidays “when wanted go somewhere” sort thing.

A real peach. would say “had fish survive.” Keep mind people *very* wealthy.

So, jack all, ran quick back envelope budget much spent order ‘fish survive.’ Driving six hours cottage purchased, driving around boat purchased maintained..... Best give 50% + 50% already got virus lol none, fuck nearly eradicate small pox, can't this? Reading tea leaves open defiance drags longer late spring. ""Christians"" biggest hypocrites world. 

I truly believe cause least 80% countries problems. know whats ""real nice""? people refuse mask social distance drags thos pandemic even longer.  point fingers people express strong frustration situation.  Phew. I'll get PS5 all. well would’ve worked people actually self-quarantined, didn’t. also broke regulations &amp; regulations couldn’t enforced properly, especially since we’re trying put people breaking lockdown jail could get covid &amp; die, drag prisoners &amp; workers. So, thanks people lockdowns, nearly well could have. relatives allowed visit, Rosecrans spent lot time phone family members. Often explain medications left try, nothing else medical team could do, keep loved one alive. always wanted work ICU, expected, part that, see patients die, sheer number pace coronavirus deaths shocked felt like ticking time bombs,"" Rosecrans says. ""I want sit wait people pass away, felt like people doomed. really hard accept. think ever really accept shift, would sit parked car, outside hospital, wrestle feelings work, would pray 'til cried,"" says.

Go away, quiet, wear mask idiot. country ""sanitary residences"" encourage mild covid cases go stay at. way isolated healthcare team checking daily. government got lot hotels function residences. Sometimes even full families one room, sick need taken care of. People get food, shelter healthcare. free. ask one web page couple hours later call tell ambulance picking up.

Another thing getting big stadium ready huge camping hospital. almost 10.000 beds non-covid cases needed hospitalization. got healthcare teams work too.

Some hospitals around exclusive children get ages. Well, children's hospitals empty accepting kids place open beds ""all ages"" hospitals. Idk, looks like USA trying go highest infection rate. concerning. 5 days started seem like hospitalizations reached plateau slowly backing 114,000. 3 bad reports row increased 6,000.

Its almost double levels reached March July, far widespread. helping now; although hospitals serious trouble become nationwide situation yet. Resources still shuffled; personnel reassigned. 

I wish faith people going right thing next weeks keep rising everywhere. good start winter. summer internship Mol’s research facility SCK-CEN 2018. Mol quaint town that’s 1.5 train ride Antwerp. 

This tragedy town small. friends family vaccinated hospitals. sounds like bunch much planning doses hand, maybe numbers timelines changing lot, whatever case, they've sending surveys staff, making lists highest priorities, giving people appointments come get vaccinated certain times. think people think hospitals giving shots end next week, bit frustrating people dropping they're administer shots, is. 

The nursing homes complicated. mostly got first batches week's allocations, there's lot arrangements made send teams nurses different home every day, also need resident sign consent forms shot, track family member resident cognitively able understand consent shot.  I've seen couple states say 4-5 weeks send everyone around give first shots nursing homes, 1.4 million total residents nursing home.

What would really make things go faster used private pharmacies let people book appointments go. 80,000 pharmacies US compared \~5,000 hospitals. staffed give vaccines like flu shots, freezer good enough Moderna Pfizer vaccine, though even Pfizer last days lesser freezer.

Using army logistics could help too, sweeping city city make big field vaccination centers administer would good. me, big turn Vietnam closed schools late January holiday didn’t reopen them. Well, PSA ad. Using ad format way reach large audience. yeah propaganda works, course.

In age group virus CFR quite low benefits risks vaccine murkier. someone history allergic reactions it’s even clearer you’d want wait take controlled healthcare setting like hospital pharmacy.

Santa Clause took breath away. One reasons we're mess lot governments (at least Western countries) taken road ""strongly imploring"" general public pandemic-prolonging behaviours versus going politically unpopular path outright banning problematic behaviours taking heavy-handed stance enforcement.

You tell people ""shouldn't leave houses unless absolutely necessary"" blue face, actually mandate it, going see massive cross-section population ignores it, makes definition absolutely necessary. 

I've seen people justify Christmas gatherings ""absolutely necessary important family's mental health!"". Okay... really telling parents sad see year. public policy perspective, that's experts would define ""absolutely necessary"", we've allowed individual create subjective definition service rationalizing pandemic-prolonging behaviours themselves.

What freedom taste like?

Trick question - freedom taste smell! area north England top 10 worst affected covid 300 local authorities back October November. 

England went lockdown November around time new variant hit South. area even top 200. Basically lockdown worked really well old variant predominant North sufficient stop new variant. Seems like big deal. Actually tax payer, fund science behind creation reagents. Big pharma basically last months work gets patent sad reason. Covid part 2 holy shit Opinions similar policies going change majority vaccinated. good friend lost sense smell taste 20 years ago. food longer pleasing, lost lot weight, good him. lot negative drawbacks, too. sometimes clothes house would smell funky let know.

not really related current events, losing smell taste bummer lot ways. Yes get it. it’s still late.

F) they're censoring opinion uninformed swaths evidence it. Ill link example below. 

G) someone hates Western existence much, assume keen take American European vaccines?


Source : think Americans voluntarily get vaccinated... paying attention last year so. give ordinary truck drivers, give US military, possibly organization one largest logistic networks world. Amazon. Like em hate em, give results. put schlong good use!  done already, shits life death.  Without reasonably many variables order 5 billion doses

That’s horrible idea honestly. $20 dose? $100 billion? US gets international credit funding fight modern plague? Sounds like good deal actually competent government place wasn’t bent self sabotage. fact getting vaccinations out, end year, goddamn miracle

Except natural progression based decades government funded research. finally getting return massive amount government dollars research. sad part private companies get patent discoveries could happen due 99.99% foundational research paid tax dollars. doubt professional. doubt percent two drivers experienced driving sensitive cryocooled cargo. Far fewer drivers needed mobilize vaccines en masse. fault transport, millions doses literally awaiting told go. plan distribution still poor. see ur sayijg thats good point definately winter general make u feel fatigued maybe due shorter daylight etc. valid!  62% efficacy covid all, zero cases severe covid zero hospitalizations (vs. 10 placebo arm).

The reason supply constraints, even today's new Pfizer deal, enough 200 million people July.  vaccines, could wrapped April. young healthy person, would definitely volunteer opt AZ instead Pfizer meant getting shot April instead September. This. know protect inefficiencies, disaster generation. Spend. The. Money.

If means shipping months early, buying thousands pounds liquid nitrogen keep stable local hospitals everywhere, means keeping 3-shifts medical professionals call administer, doesn’t matter. Whatever takes, get done. *is* America. tracking one see outcome/side effects are? never understand people read short comments obvious spelling grammar errors. wonder clinics would bill wasn’t covered. know doctors office bills $900 shingles vaccine Walmart bills $170 for. much profit Pfizer? think meant ""dying covid 26"" ""getting covid 26"".

There's reason one top news agencies world past ten years. aggregate news everywhere. getting one side unlike senior administration officials said Pfizer’s statement doses awaiting shipping instructions, technically accurate, conveniently omits explanation: planned federal officials said Pfizer committed provide 6.4 million doses vaccine first week approval. federal Operation Warp Speed already planned distribute 2.9 million doses right away. Another 2.9 million held Pfizer’s warehouse guarantee individuals vaccinated first week would able get second shot later make protection fully Yeah see, dumb understand. Good luck trolling, I'm blocking now. Im Hype Canadian division. risk stating obvious, don’t really examples illnesses people catch thing anew, month month, year year. always requires significant mutation. would also negate value vaccine. 94.5%. 5.5% “total protection”.

Surely new Covid relief bill $600 solve problems, right? Right? superpowers? got Pfizer shot Sunday nothing yet people spoiled selfish. unbelievable

GIMME GIMME GIMME Americans 1941 took shots save world, too. *CIA would like know location* wonder it’ll also able tweaked target coronavirus’. hell hasn’t done hell lot sooner. Sure it’s needed rushed even slow progress 17 years one already. That’s true. We’ve got millions sitting around planned making Pfizer storage product second doses didn’t want people missing deadlines second doses. far biggest failings distribution plans messaging related less production/actual distribution. There’s temp issues Pfizer made right quickly. could rehire nurses laid spring, starters. Oh wow Drudge Report! there's outlet known accuracy journalistic integrity.

You'd better citing rantings bus station derelict source information. covid July &amp; since exposed covid 3 times. far, reinfection. hope due immunity vs getting lucky Well good news going stay 1 million week.

You're talking first week vaccincations getting 1 million people. that's one vaccine, Pfizer. Moderna.

1 million vaccines one week amazing. expect anyone wants vaccinated opportunity late Spring

Come guys, we've known plans WEEKS PCR tests (not rapid result) 5 days post exposure generally pretty accurate. 

Babies typically fare quite well coronavirus, especially compared respiration illnesses flu. understand worry, though. checked stats, that's pretty nuts 1 20 ish citizens US work health care. No, need check vital signs every 15 minutes observant transfusion reaction, 8 9 patients. Yea, problem /s. cdc schedule outlines phases, timelines, groups. Google ""CDC vaccination schedule"" it'll take pdf yeah saw thought pretty silly. Eh. Anyway vented frustration.

Was going go see since quarantined, decided one little party hurt so... leaving quarantine. # 1. U.S.A....U.S.A!!!!....NOT. spend money get people take vaccine...can mine first! Ready waiting! Don’t want wait longer!! I’ve told Reddit reinfection absolute certainty. Even though we’ve close 80 million cases hundred confirmed reinfections. former. It’s almost certainly going like flu vaccine. U.S A. Number One! Best Worst. Interesting Argument one research more. Would suggest threshold much government funding get patent would cut first dollar government funding? Also Alaska going getting weekly deliveries due logistical problems getting monthly would imagine gives us bit beginning called US virus. rate vaccination pick way up. 

Vaccine priority crucial need - ICU/ER, senior care centers, high risk groups, medical staff. need selective supplies role virtually done appointments. takes incredible amount manpower per dose. hospital staff started getting ample supply.

Once hit larger groups walk clinics arise, numbers could 5 million day. I’m excited finally opportunity take vaccine, don’t care what’s long go back eat!! yes keep wearing masks afterwards!! beat thing!!!








Sike.. Yeah guess everyone could catch again, it'd news. know people gotten covid twice, rare far. new. I'm sure many undetected strains well. large portions population start getting vaccinated, resistant strains propagate till we're back square one - new vaccines, new multi phase trials, re-vaccinate everyone again. yearly cycle go 5 years more. 

Anyone thinking everything back normal June delusional. you’re downvoted. You’ve come full circle Lmaooo least mainstream talking knew Quarantined subreddit almost year First medical doctor virologist.

Looking study seeing ""good news"" tag; question. 

I read several times infection and/or vaccination results antibodies. 

This shows antibodies confer level protection.

Research shown antibodies decrease prevalence time

Scientists pointed addition antibodies B cells cells help immune response.

This data seems indicate antibodies (that decrease time) key element prevent reinfection.

Is REALLY good news??? indicate may need frequent ""boosters""?

&amp;#x200B;

This either public health emergency, not. is, open hospitals weekend give shots. Pretty fucking simple. ""like everyone else"" replying post. Tony unleashing power within. 253,768,092 adults United States 252,768,092 remain vaccinated. Pop corks. 

At rate (100k/day), entire adult population would vaccinated *One dose* 2537 days, 6.95 years! 2027, wrapped up. Extremely rare *from lockdowns US announce million day? Ya'll travelers fuckin crazy. someone side Channel appreciate authentic madness, I'm intrigued now. NorCal much better. Go urgent care get medical help Many American society get permission part problem politicians like, making latter major source problem also symbol what's wrong American society. Also logistically leaders' actions (or failure act) emergency matter ... yeah individualistic attitude prevalent society many Americans unwilling sacrifice sake others, play role Pretty sure clapping stopped sometime in...April? Unrelated virus, keep things closed said anything never leaving house again? Never point made.

The point people follow science, wear mask leave house, exercise whatever measures experts say give best chance avoid getting infected infecting others.

Then YOLO imma live life crowd, hell next guy, making poor life choices them, others.

Those two types people change. said, people following expert guidance continue so, walking disaster areas continue ignore it.

Vaccine going sudden open floodgate new people making bad choices. again, new normal; attending events likely require checks restrictions exist pre-covid world. 

There going switch gets flipped back 2019 group people wish be.  Wait distribute festivals sporting events. point matter going take care people stupid shit, can't get maybe time get out. course, fattest one. care health. care others? Fortunately doesn’t (directly) Covid! I’d quit soon anti-masking became thing, sooner. don’t patience. workers saints. Saving classic one revisit six months wrong like people wrong New York, Stockholm etc. “actively murder family”

good grief Insanity - trying everything possible mitigate outbreak believing magic somehow stop it. Well vaccinate hospitals working people spreading yeah needs rolled faster idiots. Okay. what? seriously. Tell me, anything, all, changes. one gets me. People literally feel opinion this, that, things change

No really. Explain change. A. Damned. Thing tell is:

Before, wanted visit couldn't.

Now want to, selfish moron. Sadly true excellent read likely beginnings understanding much trouble world truly in. question long keep truth mainstream media avoid panic, considering long able keep obvious fact virus airborne media imagine awhile majority population learns much dire situation really is. don’t usually post here, can’t stay silent longer. COVID-19 “common cold” suggested many articles ( Far it. communicability, morbidity, mortality far greater, beginning understand potential lasting health consequences disease. spread kind misinformation disheartening frustrating, especially juxtaposed public health catastrophe crushing us. many, virus seems trivial completely overblown. However, difficult grasp magnitude disaster tangible way peering abyss yourself. So, would like share experiences disease physician caring patients hospitalized COVID-19 Winter surge, worst year miles.

Patients acute respiratory failure COVID-19 account greater 80% total census many hospitals, floor floor converted COVID units. never seen one singular pathology consume entire hospitals sweeping fashion. akin wildfire. typical flu season pales comparison. Hospitals filled beyond capacity, patients waiting whole days emergency rooms beds. capacity intensive care units step-down units exhausted, thus, staff must instead care critically ill patients regular units understaffed underequipped. Ventilators, specialized nasal cannulas, home oxygen tanks rationed. stress, fatigue, tension palpable staff work bone.

The importance logistical issues notwithstanding, nearly poignant suffering individual patients. stories sticks even wash hands room. haunt even drive away hospital back home family, also exposing risk every single day.

On arrival, middle-aged man COVID-19 pneumonia required machine assistance help breathe. wife brought home virus gathering friends, also gave father mother lived them. days man admitted, father died COVID-19. mother also hospitalized. patient’s wife later hospitalized day well. 

A middle-aged man admitted COVID-19 pneumonia, also requiring machine assistance maintain oxygen levels. family attended large Thanksgiving gathering week prior 15 people. One participant tested positive COVID-19, 15 attendees contracted disease multiple hospitalizations.

An elderly man admitted COVID-19 pneumonia ultimately transitioned comfort care. However, son could visit say goodbye, even last days, son recently received organ transplant.

An elderly man intubated COVID-19 pneumonia arrival. One daughters visited boyfriend, found tested positive. brought virus home. sister contracted COVID-19 pneumonia well suddenly found dead room one morning. patient unfortunately also passed away.

A young man admitted COVID-19 pneumonia suffered cardiac arrest emergency department. contracted virus workplace.

While heartbreaking, tales suffering unique, unfortunately. hear echoes every single patient see, tales disbelief, regret, desperation, finally, sorrow. political post. also attempt minimize types ongoing societal suffering related pandemic, including financial adversity mental stress isolation. attempt make concrete unforgiving overwhelming reality disease, shed light collapse hospital system rampant death suffering dismissed downplayed many. One point clear: COVID-19 “common cold”. Let patients stories cautionary tale. Please wear mask socially distance, yourself, safety loved ones. safe, best wishes. Yup new grad I’m Arizona. don’t know it’s like covid idk I’m good, sucking I’m new seems crazy. don’t know. outdoor activity essentially wearing mask entire time default dress. real issue choke points lifts lodges restrict way businesses well (i.e. shopping lanes, restaurant bathrooms, etc.)  directed someone particular? actually do, process referred weather forecast Due short shelf life, really setup vaccination stations first come first serve vs letting sit decide get top priority first. thought affected lungs? would explain insane surge certain parts Belgium experienced throughout October. gyms CA still open indoors blatantly defying public health orders. Except fact Japanese government makes difficult get test. many hurdles go get one, many people probably getting tested. numbers skewed.

Who believe: FDA, random guy internet? yea helpful u cant abusive prick it? 

/- 99% reddit There’s also negative stereotype nurses nothing post Tik Tok videos. looked discovered they're making one million doses end 2020. I'm sure that's expensive risky since know whether works not. I'd say ability manufacture vaccine large quantities important whether vaccine works not. 

Alternatively could niche vaccine populations electricity. That's one billion people. look numbers, mask mandates done literally nothing. also crossed mind!

Put shut up. It’s science logic. vaccine works variants virus, default hypothesis work new one evidence arises contrary. 

More obvious example: “there still evidence vaccine work people living Guatemala” isnt statement way casts doubt fact work them. remember reading sometime earlier year lot scientists hopeful working vaccine would created time virus would change way would continually making new vaccines every months. One main reasons we've never vaccine Corona type virus . course 2020 feels like lasted decade I'll damned find articles. I'm curious going end, want see plays out. That’s true wouldn’t recommend strategy.

Either way, let’s get facts right. death rate 40 roughly flu.

That’s much true. flu it’s 1 100,000 (and excludes asymptomatic flu cases). COVID-19 it’s around 1 5000 (includes asymptomatic cases) likely vote Republican too. 2 seconds work. NIOSH n95. originally 100m think real question pace start up. week big deal compared ongoing throughput. full administration system running, many people given shot weekly? think clarity number data points...


-Pfizer shot takes 10 min give. 2-3 times longer flu shot. Moderna quicker believe, J&amp;J would need 1 shot full effect even quicker. 

-max flu shots given month 60M

-in order get done early summer need get point giving least 60M shots month (which pzifer would mean 2-3x time)

-there infrastructure ramping beyond flu season help this.


It's unclear adds to. clear warp speed govern vaccines state level. Warp speed get shots 250M Americans memorial day J&amp;J AZ approved, shots may 250M arms till labor day, fully effective till month later. mention monitoring someone 15/30 minutes injection.... 328 million go literally couldn’t hit nail head.

We complete slaves end-stage capitalism. Republican party gobbles peasant tears fun. half country goes along it. place fucking blowsssssssss keep pace little holidays pass realistic date vast majority Americans doses vaccine? Still summer 21 additional 16,525 coronavirus cases reported Los Angeles County Wednesday, along 145 deaths

More deaths Canada today, 3x many new cases... LA county get you. cases increasing increasing, however, think working. intentionally obtuse fact obviously going accelerate. obtuse fact already moved really really fast. disease around like year, we've already got multiple working vaccines. Like we're witnessing historic achievements absolutely herculean efforts medical community worldwide, sitting screaming ""not good enough! Faster! Faster! Waaahhhhh!"" Hostile? I'm not. trying tell everyone ""it's easy"" ""there supply issue"". bigger question is, claiming supply issue, medical professionals country wide often still faced supply issues? implication clear - supply there, fail logistics.

But evidence supply exists far forthcoming.

So either started argument supply existing, without actually knowing fact, knows why, intentionally avoiding actually proving claim true know false, asshat whatever reason.

You claim easy get 100 online. basically challenged ""put shut up"". changed story. 

Now whine hostile.

You one making claims mete current knowledge. prove claims. really? think innovation science technology last 50 years, chances produced dude US repurposed military/NASA research.

Which exactly Berners-Lee did. work done back established DoD technology. 

I think you’ve lost plot though. point US way things drastically alter outcome horrible situations seemingly last possible minute. one dying purely commercial form internet wasn’t invented yet. God blesses [Project Jets Jesus! braindead thing I've read LMAO kids suffer alone say anything. Op people upvote smart people. rest us morons numbers great smart ineffective upcoming changes.  focus Sweden perceived, pretty telling priorities people dying getting sick bit simple alteration. would mean everyone currently vaccinated would need revaccinated millions doses already made would trash would need start again.  would complete shit show. mention would lead higher distrust people take vaccine. Lets hope god vaccine still works bad. 2022 needs left alone. Gotta World Cup uninterrupted. 1 million people halfway fully vaccinated. Let's let pretend every dose vaccine given fully vaccinated individual. Cases gone 30% since thanksgiving, deaths nearly doubled. case count probably artificially low due lack testing. near 100% increase deaths weeks I'd call ""a negligible impact"". That's right language use. Words literally lost meaning. vaccinated Covid? symptoms? I've reading, still contract spread Covid vaccine... get symptoms. wonder many disagree handle COVID, one lax (not wearing mask, wanting go several places, etc.) strict (wearing mask, going except grocery store, etc.)?! Depends inject it. thing might happen 2022 fandom conventions maybe big people) events. Everything else back normal Anecdotally, call morning mentioned different distribution chains place vaccine City, City provided batch, State-operated nursing homes got batch, tribal health clinic got batch. Trouble was, tribal health clinic bunch doses left over, short window use dispose them, couldn’t find enough people willing able take vaccine. didn’t hear doses wasted, sounds like were.

The logistics delivering vaccine short shelf life patchwork different health systems across one largest geographical countries world weak central government complicated. Thanks info point, need make decisions. It’s almost guaranteed things significantly better next 6-ish months. distancing friends family I’m vaccinated, period. It’s going happen. 

Even there’s degree restrictions beyond 2021, really, really doubt, nobody going shoot gathering. Technically could even now, even though would really stupid. It’s matter personal risk tolerance individual factors like everyone vaccinated, etc. Sure 12 months. problem. /s work ""48 hours process paperwork"" issue messed previous forecast? simple math puts us roughly 10 years citizens get vaccinated. 1 million / 10 days. 365 million / 3650 days.

But happens virus mutates need new shot? Who's say virus end mutating every year like flu live RONA forever? Interesting freaking covid mutation UK none major news sources heavily reporting one Dont give 2020 ideas think meant response production vaccine. haven’t heard anything trump hear Biden would licensure certification medical position accredited institution apply, medical workers already working, bailed completely. Oh come damn pedantic. takes effort sweat, bribes, favors. lamen could it. Forget said easy say feasible. Yeah take get everything loaded ancient public health computer systems. UK sequences 10% cases, country. US national response, hospitals universities test own. know one way another unless testing sequencing cases. UK told everyone soon knew problem, many, many mutations one, many discovered UK since many countries barely bother sort work going start somewhere UK one best places that. Cases gone 30% since Thanksgiving. Deaths doubled. case number probably artificially low due inadequate testing. every measure huge surge. People trauma tendency compare others downplay it. agree comparable war, different people different tolerances stress trauma. Someone's parent dying could cause 1 kid normal grief cycle, another kid spiral drug abuse, PTSD, etc. dont get tell people effected allowed be. I’ve told hospitals intense, didn’t think I’d ever see hospitals actually tents around here. thats horrendous agree, seem like logistics issue me. think places gotten shipments vaccines using  isnt vaccine created months little studies side effects, fix something isnt even issue lol covid hoax bought hook line n sinker.

Yes im skeptical. hand walk single file follow rules made gov pushed media. proven time tome want worst lol. notice called ""sneeze guards"" ""pee guards""? December 29th passengers high risk area (every country right now, per ministry foreign affairs) incoming flights (into Netherlands) needs show prove negative coronatest that's less 72 hours old. Otherwise allowed board. i'll add perspective Covid Third Wave Ground Zero Los Angeles: local &amp; state leaders refused shut kind retailers, even large malls &amp; outlets. &amp; experts believe better spread shoppers throughout many different channels &amp; venues, created business-as-usual atmosphere ppl even realize Lockdown place. psychological impact mass retailer shutdown value creates panic &amp; hunker mindset public. It’s pretty easy me. Send hospitals country. Whoops. mother worked hospital 40 years ago told deaths occur night early morning hours. know much truth thought I'd share. Excellent!

Fantastic job! r/thereisnobottom

please love family death

please celebrate later received vaccination &amp; waited long enough immune systems developed full response makes feel proud Texan... Catalent? relatively low levels pre-existing COVID-19 cases community

Recent numbers show one state (Vermont)meet definition relatively low levels initially specified (21 new daily cases per 100k) Fucking idiot. Shoot em head selfishness utter incompetence. things Biden says would do, Trump already done. effective, especially setting needing icu care. Maybe useful early kind debated.

All really got steroids now. Everything Ive said involved science numbers. Everything say anecdotal. kid gets covid school, relatively big deal yes. kids entire class could get covid, heck entire school statisticaly every single one would likely fine

Did know reinfection occur virus immunity something confirmed least 8 months vast vast vast majority individuals covid19. friends anecdote isnt worth bits took store comments Bullshit. 

It’s you. people spread to? didn’t sign selfish behaviour.

And explain many religious sorts said “God protect me,” promptly died it? another one day.

Selfish arsehole.  doctor friend Canada told this: annoying people sprouting conspiracy. B.1.1.7 genetic lineage first detect Kent sequence submitted tracking database back Sept 20th. 17 specific sets identified mutation confers three worrisome characteristic, alteration S-protein appears confer increased infectivity due explosive growth variant, contribution diagnostic failure assay tests targets gene, ability evade immune response confers ability chronic infection. last point worrisome preliminary data suggests chronic infection, especially among immunocompromised individuals, propelling high rates mutation. COVID acquires higher lethality combined infectivity immune evasion characteristic, bitching seeing family members. lineage NEEDs eradicated now. UK capacity resource sequence track mutation lineages well. countries can't it. Go nextstrain.org look phylogentic tree cluster already 1100 sequenced mutants documented 3 months. comparison, adjacent lineage 280 mutants since Aprils. really think government officials degrees PPE really brains comprehend shit exploit political gains? advisory scientist. Ya that’s weird isn’t it?  feel like holding back 50% doses second round way ought going. way going places received X amount doses prioritized receive another X doses within second dosage time frame.

Holding 50% back would something would anticipate getting more.

I'm saying hold *any* reserve, could unforeseen supply chain shortages, feels like holding 50% back overly conservative. got results evening hate needles anything entire world (including bees), pass every time I’m near one. said, getting vaccine soon it’s available me. cannot come quick enough, wait it’s turn.  Might wanna check definition bud get tell fat diabetic aunt save even cost long term testing that’s much trouble... Again, I'm pointing hypocrisy. raped mugged, would call? im sure ball park figures... subscribed *Pulp Facts* expect even mutations make vaccines 100% effective still *fairly* effective. in, getting vaccinated guarantee get infected new strain, reduce likelihood reduce severity. What? fuck? 71% country wants it. That's one point past threshold herd immunity, one part month-long pattern increase number Americans want get vaccine. I've always wondered hospitals would use term ""stable"" someone ICU, given one almost inherently means one's condition potentially likely change quickly. 

To say nothing, course obvious issue: patient getting couple stitches ER ""stable"" someone long term vegetative state. Something keep eye something take seriously panicking yet. Doesn’t seem deadlier, contagious. medical experts believe vaccine work strain well. UK government far saints, honestly preaching high horse US year had? understand blame game internet playing UK, they're one bothering sequence. Yeah sure. Free vaccines undocumented immigrants. shouldn’t care. They’re humans too, live among us. want many people possible get vaccine seems like we're expecting 6 million doses Pfizer + Moderna available end first quarter, would work 500,000 per week. understandable earliest shipments would lower rate described, pace picking up. found document here, looks updated within last week: fourth paragraph advanced purchase agreements, Canada initially receive combined total 6 million doses Moderna Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines, authorized, distribution allocation first quarter 2021.

I'm personally hoping schedules we've given represent highly conservative estimates, things actually end moving along lot faster, time tell. Pritzker best thing could happened Illinois pandemic. guys gotta give body couple weeks second shot able go around freely. wear masks sake others. Italy, 27th ""symbolic"" day 5 people get vaccinated. bit less 10k doses distributed following week, around 450k arriving ""starting 28th"". There's lot focus symbolic aspects (they appointed architect designed flower-shaped domes constructed public squares! symbolizes regeneration!). get government convince significant contingent vaccine-skeptics, oooof can't put proper roll plan place symbolic live-streamed shots time?

Judging hard get flu vaccine fall, imagine logistics nightmare. envious pace US vaccinations. kid gets covid school that’s big deal?

Also it’s hilarious mods deleting comment friend got reinfected person telling us it’s harmless kids. Irony much?

Pull wool eyes, sheep. get Moderna quite while, gonna Pfizer Oxford.

I certainly see Lockdown NYE, would allow police control house parties easier try working it. Basically everyday lose job income. I’m little choice people here, experience different months, worth 50% meal? Basic understanding would told wasn’t safe people choice. Horrible staff knowing aren’t even following underwhelming safety protocols due demand drive profit, knowing people literally going pay lives road. I’d lick door handle right 30 series graphics card :( known positive still saw you? public health authorities need truthful campaigns.

When resort misleading puffery undermine credibility teach groups like anti- vaxxers wage effective misinformation campaigns. Nope, J&amp;J. Oxford still requires two doses, easier Moderna, longer requires frozen shipped. It’s also 25% less effective either Pfizer Moderna. ones buying 3rd world countries who’d rather prioritize saving money effective vaccine, even still they’re probably better waiting J&amp;J. Oxford basically irrelevant right now, kind surprising given early promise massive head start development. Sadly governments look got us. Yeah, early Australia. Maybe 6-8 months ago? half population lives two populous cities. Australia similar urbanisation rate United States. people upset? really seen that. need perspective though. great vaccine soon identified pandemic, 1 million doses ten days means would take nine years vaccinate everyone.

It's great, nowhere near scale needs coming weeks months. reading huge stain hospitals CA ND TN SC? Nurses breaking experiencing PTSD levels death. Patients waiting parking lots. Thanksgiving huge reason things are. vaccine 1 week lol. Production ramping shots administered second. would take years. Also numbers days old, we’re probably closer 3M-5M. Also covid vaccines approved well I’m sure people sub want keep talking gloom doom good numbers things considered Depends state, Know Pennsylvania starting vaccinations LTCF Monday. Hi, yeah, I'm scientist either! 

But, far heard variants changes spike (esp. UK one)

It's spike changes much mRNA vaccines stop working. think changes enough right now, could mutations line. Good news all! would indeed funny. Scary. hope stay safe! mind asking, allergies? Also, experience side effects vaccine?  you’re presenting facts doesn’t mean contribution can’t bit needlessly negative. 

And yes, people ignored social distancing mask wearing. doesn’t mean people won’t get vaccine, shots that. see, way literally everyone know sees pandemic something like this: know covid real, they’re sick lockdowns want go back normal life. They’re sick social distancing wearing masks they’ll break rules time time maybe frequently. recognize taking vaccine quickest route putting behind us. they’re pretty damn motivated take vaccine. 

Also, someone that’s willing take first shot vaccine nature going pretty willing take second dose vaccine. people didn’t want take second dose they’re anti vaxx, wouldn’t taken first dose begin with. Well think that's last plot point Contagion. it! Production distribution though. I'm done you, go try actually read something factual. important note Fauci purposefully gives pessimistic estimates disappoint people. estimate worst case scenario. highly organized anti-vax disinformation groups becoming national security threat. know they’re lying. Why? They've it. antibodies now. call BS like every covid story. Stay houses scared I'm going living life die meant continue enjoy life usual. Holidays remaining family getting together like Thanksgiving birthdays. Everybody's healthy fine thank good Lord. would okay appointment locations drive thru. ones walk up, I'm like okay covid waiting line people hours probably great way get it. Unfortunately think symptoms matter either asked 311 telling feel good, kind like yeah, that's situation, good luck. hope husband okay! Eat shit, Bob side effects yet? 

And old vulnerable health person? thinking correct 1% population Alaska pretty neat accomplishment? assuming weird population dispersal, complicate efforts. seven day running average 5340 December 9 going since, according site:  fuck? going NYE overrated, want now? I'd imagine hold doses administration. 

And doses increase exponential rate. like virus estimated. seems like lot, rate, everyone immunized little nine years. feel like shit together that's exactly would work count much less depressing various counts we’ve tracking 9+ months core Protestantism? God pleased behave work hard rewards wealth. even little bit. Changes nothing I’m living. Im reaching end rope fear. don’t feel anything anymore. KiDs cAnT sPrEaD iT! don’t possess respiratory system. /s example employee can't get vaccine might given special accommodations keep safe working.

lmao I'm imagining someone refuses get vaccine person work still wearing mask. Well speculation US army olympic team Wuhan near market first hotspot.

Im saying, probably never know first, judging reports couple Americans, naaasty strange flu going around late last year. never know truth, virus could originated America Wvu big discrepancy vaccinated ready administered? Fair point. 

As far it, [the current advice still get 1 Million many people actually gotten vaccine. government distributed 9.5 million doses states. would process getting high risk, 65+ family member vaccine moves phase 1b? application contact local hospital? Thank you! know people administering shots aren’t ones counting number shots administered right? possible. unlikely. likely either string poor choices multiple people and/or one ""source"". article, article linked within, say happened 2 weeks. Even one person single handedly gave 7 people virus, odds contracting dying 2 week period seems bit off. reports studies say 14 day incubation period majority deaths happen 2-5 weeks after. Also, person directly responsible 7 deaths would mean spread hundreds thousands people, given fatality rate. Again, 2 week period. 

Again, doubt person helped spread. way solely responsible 7 deaths. probably changes RNA part DNA. Scary stuff information spread people history severe allergic reaction know it? It’s 25% less effective leading vaccines still requires two doses. Moderna longer needs frozen shipped, Oxford made irrelevant. people see buying Oxford 3rd world countries would rather save money effective vaccine, even they’re probably better waiting JNJ requires one dose. God that's weak. Weak, sick excuses weak, sick nation. 

Taiwan failing. Korea, Japan, Singapore, New Zealand, Vietnam failing. China even failing anymore. Failure inevitable. choice. 

And pride? Please.... shreds left thoroughly decimated this.

America fucking joke, makes fucking joke, there's goddammed thing done it. sit take it. family leave. can't leave. abandoning I've got left.

But America clearly fucking done. fucking humiliating American. Rip u/TriumphITP posted link actual study reviewed it. posted response comment reposting well (base study looked it.

From discussion conclusions section (pg 25/62);

*"" Using district county level data Michigan Washington, investigate instructional modality public K-12 schools – in-person, hybrid, remote – wake COVID-19 pandemic influences spread COVID wider community. find community COVID rates strongly positively correlated in-person hybrid forms schooling simple, naïve regression models. important exception described Section 5 summarized below, findings persist allow effects school modality differ according level community spread population add covariates account various district community factors, mask wearing political preferences. general findings hold variety OLS fixed effects model specifications. important exception find evidence in-person modality associated increased COVID spread communities relatively high pre-existing levels COVID. ""*

**Translation**... 

""*We find community COVID rates strongly positively correlated in-person hybrid forms schooling simple, naïve regression models.*""

Places person schooling **higher rates** Covid transmission.

""*these findings persist allow effects school modality differ according level community spread population add covariates account various district community factors, mask wearing political preferences.""*

This link person schooling higher rates transmission explained things (*usually*). example, difference mask usage social distancing etc, explains higher rate.

**The Exception**..

""*The important exception find evidence in-person modality associated increased COVID spread communities relatively high pre-existing levels COVID.""*

When rates community transmission high ( daily average case counts 21 cases per 100,000 ... **EVERY STATE VERMONT** ) person schooling shows increased spread **cannot** explained factors shows daily rate state You’re quite optimistic given humans regularly ignored violated social distancing simple mask wearing selfish reasons. commenter isn’t Debbie downer, they’re literally presenting facts new vaccine. got tested April, June, things fast, efficient. mostly stayed in, felt fine. days ago started showing symptoms, feeling good, wanted get tested again. completely overwhelmed.  America likely already strains advanced enough test get family vaccine? wonder many ""asymptomatic cases"" actually people know sick, poor quarantine work anyway?

I know lot people position wanting quarantine, wanting homeless kids starve.

Fuck system. Nah hospitals fucking I’m position hear understand feelings. immensely difficult year. Keep chin up. soon. Happy Holidays best wishes yours. Awesome! 10million hospitals slow shit. Stock still won’t move penny right, overweight, obese. Great Idea. Freeze swamp learn take care people. glanced thumbnail thought RBG picture. article refers VUI- 202012/01, B.1.1.7, variant commonly associated spread UK last weeks/months.

See: Let’s hope so. help us get faster.  wonder much practical help positive people get. Positives separated negatives - maybe quanantine hotel. possible, loaned hepa filters (about $120/ea) + plastic sheeting basic HVAC band-aids isolate in-site. feeling everyone wings there's lot in-familiy transmission could get prevented. shame behavior crime. exactly feel. don’t know I’m going it. Covid even started invade dreams. I’ll dreaming I’m something normal, public space &amp; start panic, realize I’m around ton people don’t masks realize don’t mine either. backs wall

Very true. entire situation ""backs wall"" .. never happened 1st place. funded Oooh, do? whats Covid-19 death rate HIV positive people? data? can't read can't help you.  I'm selfish eighty-year-old mother requesting see still see I'm able hug kiss her. selfish ask oblige? masks work using 200 years flu season? Believe BS continue life normal infecting anybody. go public family's house. go houses families confined choose join Society. welcome Freedom. happy controlled go socialist country get citizenship. don’t remember take. I’m sure wing nuts saying don’t recall widespread thing (unless you’re referring anti vax blowbags) guys call trump fascist ""Only happens China""

China's outbreak surprise, could've avoided hospitals like this.

It choice, face consequences. Grateful honored part one million. deal injection site soreness low grade fever, well worth part solution apologies earlier comment gone, meant response someone else. I'll careful future. How's that? approved UK first. don’t leave then? true, read all, thank context. even so, virus may equally deadly across races, spread minority communities worse. possible reasons besides mindless diversity purposes. Either way, hard argue vaccinating people work public unfair, racially otherwise. doctors said vaccine still works mutations problem. people keep referencing current rate like it’s going continue? Especially moderna gets going? baby niece recovered covid. Lucky children's immune response advances adults react strongly thus much lower fatality. You’re fucking idiot mean I’m making shitty comments it’s ridiculous people elsewhere act similar healthcare workers nose grind middle class job. whole family nurses I’m cook.

They educated leads good salaries amazing benefits. People act like constantly screwed underpaid class not. work hard many people making way less put “dangerous” situation pandemic. 

I think lot people like bit tired nurse praise underpaid overworked class. We’ll know soon natural immunity lasts 1 year. strains around awhile. happened March would worried. approval two vaccines two way, I’m worried. don’t think I’m pretty sure happens diseases. practically alert... spoiled selfish mindset.

Bit that.

The Trump administration fumbling, usual. messing vaccine distribution incompetence. 

The miracle science delivered us vaccine year start pandemic. Shame government dropping ball actual delivery said vaccine. Every day waste ineffective transportation vaccines another day American’s dying. We’re literally racing save lives point, Trump administration can’t get anything right. people assume virus won’t go away everyone infected. 

Well that's entirely inaccurate statement True. point normal trucking able handle transport, federal government handle distribution logistics trucks arms. would use term criminal, that's me. wonder presymtomatics shedding droplet nuclei come from? understanding presymtomatics shed lot lungs (especially D614 variant) instead mostly nose throat.  nose generates little droplet nuclei (except sneezes definition fairly rare ""presymptomatic"" common Covid compared RTIs).  However, throat generates \*lot\* droplet nuclei talking even talking loudly. PCR test CT value score taken throat would possible good proxy infectivity. 

&amp;#x200B;

But even better public health would rapid test less sensitive; here's reasoning: 

Remember CT values basically inverse log10 viral copies per mL. time series graphs see show build peak right symptom breakthrough trend - graphs log graphs. real peak really super high log graph probability droplet nuclei viable viron \*linear\* viral load throat. Nobody getting colds flu right now; COVID symptoms suspicious start avoiding crowds. would bet 85%+ onward transmission peak day two symptom breakthrough rapid test tuned this. high CT PCR useless: takes 2 days turn around infectious anymore - got symptoms!  high CT PCR test like great super bright headlights, except fact mounted wrong side car... see were, going. low sensitivity rapid test give indication highly infectious tomorrow. 


It 100% even 80% accurate cut spread. rapid test gets 50% isolate go public, (ceterus paribus) cut Ro spread 50%. could huge. High risk workplaces communal living situations could rapid tests 3x week really cut spread. I’m usually deplatforming people opinions seriously believe people like be. 

This becoming serious threat public health. Me, mom, dad got vaccinated today. cried kind ladies shots handed card confirming vaccination. whole thing nightmare breathe little easier knowing won’t kill dad mom get it. (He’s 50’s heart condition + smokes.) hope everyone know kind relief feels like soon 328 million people US. New covid dance there's way we're gonna hit 20 million 31st, I'm optimistic vaccination programs scale got lot more. Freedom facts

Freedom science

Freedom others Coronavirus isn’t safe. question could infected strains time either.

That's interesting idea - evidence multiple strains detected single person yet? worry much. know three people vaccinated two bad headaches next day. typical usually goes away that.

Yes, time careful you. Stay safe take risks. Soon free clear! haven’t heard anything vaccinating young children either way. truly want strive herd immunity vaccination, vaccinate everyone. would figure vaccination actually prevents people getting spreading keeps people getting symptoms. lot figure out. Americans vaccinated June isn’t going happen. Looks like Unemployment bringing parties together vs. Republican Senate year end. Nice way tap season. biggest covid denier know 75 decided Christmas shopping today 2:00 pm. bitched restaurants arent open person dining. argue health care workers going on. Unreal vaccine come limited edition steelbook cases shitty day 1 DLC packs? wouldn’t celebrate yet. Let’s hope vaccine works new variants. Knowing global luck nowadays, it’ll mutate become resistant. probably gain mers fatality, moon probably crash us put us misery. God bless family. 

Not single Anti-Mask ""COVID Hoax"" politician vaccinated frontline heroes like her. Brilliant, instead throwing money away trying educate dumb bribe Go ahead quote think link helps prove point. someone Northern Ireland, going end well, especially people ignoring guidelines, might flying 6 week lockdown schools open 5 weeks thanks excuse government. 😬  buyer state run psychiatric hospital. offered vaccine staff hospital. Slide 19 20. release raw models slides show output based two different assumptions (transmission prevention disease prevention). problem people confuse regular cold flu. influenza first time last year experience taught much worse regular cold sickness I've ever experienced before. No. almost million abortions another million miscarriages alone every year USA. Virus got four days release pfizer, saying they're involved operation warp speed. Go create another troll account, one failed. elderly account *most* deaths, I’ve seen enough “36 Year Old Brooklyn Man Dies COVID-19” headlines keep locked personally vaccinated.

If means deaths low June everyone partying, still haven’t gotten shot arm, I’m going wait bit longer. need wait, take J&amp;J data ENSEMBLE trial currently anticipated available end January 2021. However, trial dependent disease events, timing approximate. data indicate vaccine safe effective, Company expects submit Emergency Use Authorization application U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA) February. cousin works prison ER nurse getting shot, least beginning front line workers. numbers useful unless compare risk covid 26 year old. CVS partnership CDC thats starting around 1st companies weren’t built massive vaccination campaigns still need time hire enough people. Let's get crazy here. Keep mind. I'm fairly confident pfizer vaccine 2 part shot takes 60 days fully effective.

So 1 million people received first dose manufactured primarily US

Along vaccine Moderna developed US better lmao  that’d shaking like leaf. need place vent but...my bf traveling California spend Christmas family (gathering 8 people so) refuses take test gets back ""doing anything risky"" (in words). seeing 2 weeks. HOWEVER, he's flying get tested comes back trip we're seeing month.

I tired explaining matter safe family thousands people airport alright, you. Hi mom also tested negative three times rt pcr. India parents doctors. would recommend getting ctscan chest done grandparents high risk. mom dad though tested negative showed lung damage consistent covid infections. immediately put dosages ivermectin vitamin d3. Please talk doc regarding this. elderly imperative give treatments early possible. mom dad recovered showed antibodies later. grandparents come contact covid person? Vaccines approved 16/18 depending vaccine, need 100% population reach heard immunity. Republicans monolithic entity either... smart we'd vaccinating young people next. Remind 12 months Season 2 make renewed. still talks development. Currently writers I'd season 1 considering Sopranos like ending. people still give shit what's facebook?! vaccinating again? long take build resistance virus get shot. overly sensitive mate. asked plan ramp up. one got defensive carried small NZ is. s/o got written reported contact someone it. Pfizer manufacturing vaccine 3 plants US seem bad across state, even though two regions capacity - see Even northern California situation best (28.8%), however, take much 'the cup run over''. According link spare capacity statewide 1.1%. One big party, religious gathering or, case, mall mob 'no vacancy' sign. wonder shipping surplus areas southern California ? doubt state lot room spare. Convenient ""actual studies"" observational without single decent RCT. We've seen HCQ, nobody else interested decent RCT comes out. then, knock horse pills whatever ivermectin fanboys upto days.

Oh - article quotes multiple scientists, including health ministers _author ""studies"" love_ - talking evidence remotely sufficient yet. are.

Funny took trigger pointing ivermectin cult =) think families wearing masks thinking they’re safe take eat right next other.  know lot 330 million children right? counted adult population yo.

Thank coming Ted talk! 

-Smitty's Woodworking u/Alien_Illegal seem know talking about. Could provide input explain I'm missing. I'm genuinely curious, trying troll.

Thanks  forget spend millions helping countries helping homeless needy well 19 million confirmed cases, probably (easily) many untested cases, 40 million immunity (yea, know reinfection yet far pretty quiet.)

So 12%ish population safe, far 'hErD' something 1 10 people give virus vector, gotta slow SOME. 25%, masking, we'll see big drops. said come speak cases got LA county. Now, moved goalposts. think Orange county magical something like masks? Why? way efficient give 1000 doses press ""1000"" button press button every single time. That’s good! Wave goodbye Sure won't, today.
[
Wait 4 5 months. Come May, everyone wants vaccinated been, lockdowns end social distancing end, 1/4 population vaccinated keep spreading virus everywhere, we're gonna feel lot less accepting anyone get vaccinated. First Latin American country get vaccine, one first world completely free. fuck could possibly hope learn asinine fucking question?

Lmao .....yikes. shut Covid-22 Covid-23 appears years?

I never stopped. 2 trips NC VA mountains year. One fall foliage trip, seen fall foliage years. trip August visit relatives. Went New Orleans early July shut bars again. 

Right I'm back visiting parents family members. even got airplane it. I'm still here. wait start living. can't decide we've always selfish, we've gone rails. World War II blackouts, rationing, scrap metal drives, war bond drives, etc. I'm sure black markets, draft dodgers such, seems people united willing sacrifice back way people today not. good practice too. would obviously need language included securing access, waivers absolutely medically needed person get vaccine, situations. broadly speaking, someone time next year sitting hands refusing get vaccine available costs nothing, absolutely deal fallout if/when get virus.  Extremely unlikely probably impossible. 

Genetic sequencing shown us anywhere Asia Europe back November. Antibody studies backed up. certainly community transmission US Nov 2019. cases late November would travel history. 

Thus far think sequencing points making US mid December. Although cases brought February. fair that’s like going grocery store. Hell, eating fruits vegetables without washing dangerous even COVID. Imagine many times they’ve touched...... Ok, totally agree pandemic big deal, stupid point make.

The population increasing... number people dying also increasing, least way tracks previous historical birth rates paired average life-span. 

It’s thing making big deal record stock market numbers. Inflation makes constantly seeing near record numbers, outside periodic downturns.

Both stupid points make, make obvious people making don’t understand they’re dumb points, gets meta dumb. better that. Sorry hear that, hope recover quickly uneventfully.

Also, wife want hold parts Christmas couple weeks celebrate together, one year old might still small enough notice much Christmas partly January year. got Moderna vaccine definitely less painful flu shot me. arm barely even sore. actually completed vaccine less year. wish could something nice scientists worked hard achieve feat. guess I'll stay indoors decrease potential another mutation.  What's estimate till average person gets vaccine? 

This radical news. man hard triggering people. Despite one writer thinks, there's plenty evidence ivermectin's efficacy, like actual studies. This! want premiums increased people take vaccine ran giant inpatient medical bill got covid.  seems like there’s lot stuff you’re kind assuming. There’s much novel strain don’t know perhaps wait better data claim reinfection. basically number asses show dominance try look like good guys agreeing lower payment plan?

what fucked american dream bullshit system?

im confused even point numbers .... Perfectly said.

Centuries medical knowledge ignored someone saw facebook post... This. married nurse sounds exactly use explain it. Even non profit hospitals run like major corporations, look CEO salaries. fucking joke. got first shot yesterday PUMPED. less painful flu 100% worth - took picture vaccination card show friends! Production distribution ramping up. 18 million known cases. know cases still 10-20% actual cases might 50% already infected. Production distribution ramping up. replied wrong person, never said kind of, said tax payers paid technology, private companies get patents profit it. Yes lol exactly saying, possibly even Producing distribution ramping up. study Indiana showed 1/1000. Looks like 4 10 get COVID. sub def insufferable times lol. basically r/coronaviruspolitics r/circlejerk combined one would zombies? Oh mean truck drivers average stupid incapable coworkers are? Got it.

From quality three guys know quit get CDLs believe it. I'm thinking along lines April-May. already way cold northeast. absolute SECOND weather goes 50 people collectively give up. reserve 50% second dose, 28 days need sure receive least double doses received first day want mantain rate new vaccinated persons. day 28 receive amount vaccines received first day  able vaccinate new persons day. without reserving second dose go faster first day slow later, think least double amount doses produce 28 days making reserve best approach thanksgiving wave. curve continued before, seems peaking. Probably, first dose 50% effective, second brings 95%. excellent vaccine 100%.  Going outside always enough us. family's Sri Lankan even going outside, Vitamin levels low. Coincidentally started, taking 2000 Units day got minimum normal blood test (one point lower would low) I've taking 4000 Units that's pushed reasonable amount finally. can’t wait care Pst blocked yet Americans give shit anyone except themselves. people really skewed perceptions health healthy... friend, spends 12 hours/day front pc, doesnt walk, train basically physical activity whatsoever, eats drinks junk day thinks healthy overweight... like yeah buddy im sure body really grateful feed junk daily base

There far healthy young skinny think futile ban people UK. 

The new strain could many countries. get microchip second dose, slip first one? Done. I’m done. want ride. uh dont mean america? 99% country hotspot lmao CB-NAAT accurate RT-PCR test? 2 weeks 2k drops You’re letting arrogance slip put words mouth. I’m doubting reinfection. questioning prevalence reinfection. seem dump suspected confirmed biases. Wonder that's insulation shortage. accounting disparity healthcare systems? legal weed godsend year. Amazing humans able article provide criticlal piece information seemingly identity workplace protected. type workplace this? Warehouse, salon, office? risk spread different depending work environment. need information disclosure types things. Ugh. course virus spreads heavily populated areas. 

The anti-mask “hoax virus” nonsense right made everything worse. ""Everyone stupid except me.""

\-Everyone guarantee many people would back streets within week. would definitely help people fallen tough times.  democrats...

I'm finding funny could've made real distinction didn't. pandemic either drives apart closer together vaccine going change anything many people refuse take it? Wont still mutations? Federal Government won’t stop them, state doesn’t authority best state within legal authority. wish could mine now. time I’m go dread think horrible would catch they’re literally vaccinating people daily. I'm sure mean. 

Think like numbered pearls string. pearls amino acids, string spike protein.

N501Y means amino acid Tyrosine position 501. D614G means amino acid Glycine position 614. 

The South African variant even D614G.  Back 80's, air traffic controllers went strike Union rules. Pres. Regan fired replaced military employees. happen here. I'm sick nurses bitching whining pandemic. Yet time dance Tik Tok vidoes?!! Thank information. encouraging! far healthy young skinny

That’s actually Bio war real. low. Get zinc, C Pedialyte. Encourage drink lots fluids rest. She'll fine. Yeah make 9 women babies month. Honestly work it'll really obvious like something could cover up. incorrectly said rapid test then. take test twice week work. believe takes home sends in? Either way, assuming accurate getting tested/quarantining they're home, definition homeless, homelessness solved.

They still mentally ill drug addicts alcoholics, course. great Get absolutely fucking shit covid Works IQ well ! Bring back Antarctica!!1 You’re forgetting homeless isn’t direct problem many cases, rather indirect result mental illness, drug addiction, abuses many forms. giving someone roof food won’t solve homelessness unfortunately. Can't wait never get it! I’m curious...do people already COVID? stop getting COVID? say already carriers take vaccine spread virus? benefit that. Every single doser still needs two future doses guarantee proper immunity. never reduce total number people needing two vaccine shots single doses.

You also speed immunizations length one shipment. weekly distributions total factory output, immunizations delayed 1 week one distributions worth people exchange greatly reducing risk able get second dose.

It worth basically means delayed shipment puts operation week behind. streaming shots across shipments, one week delay actually counts two weeks due single doses given invalidated. I'm really worried South Africa strain, looks like dangerous one Low key big hog ...wasn’t humongous surge Midwest? thanksgiving? job know I'm talking about. I'm ""assuming"" reinfection rates. I'm ""assuming"" virus magically acts differently different states there's border. access plenty data make informed decisions input model reinfection. seems like wanting reinfection reality based what? gut instinct? biases? Sorry, reality. immunology suggests possibility 7% previously infected population (waning immunity, lack memory B cells, failure seroconvert, extrafollicular B cells producing antibodies, HLA restricted CD8 cells naive stem cell like rather effector, etc). data certainly supports existence decently high numbers. caping management? one saying extraordinary event things different ever been. once-in-a-lifetime event mean acceptable hospital administrators furlough nurses crazy shit trying. Airplanes actually good air exchange systems since they're constantly blasting air outside. air entire cabin gets cycled every minutes. tips one needle phobic person another - let know! i’m scared know guess rapid wrong word use. gets tested twice week works administrative capacity hospital mean, he’s fat, don’t see claim he’s healthy. Also post since didn’t relate COVID? Yes, thats exactly point.

Britain US allies last 80 years. think get 2 day shipping perk sticker wonder us average people gonna get it? live So-Cal hoping get one March (but WISHING could get one tomorrow)..... nothing giving everyone one dose second, much hold back second doses versus letting supply chain provide naturally. reason hold back doses protect disruption supply chain, trading risk versus potential benefit people partially innoculated.

And no, 52% ""really bad"". going approve vaccine something like 60-65% efficacy, thats bad things are. people partial immunity (that likely reduces symptoms even get it), huge plus. Stop trying downplay value getting first shot people earlier.

And ""wasting vaccine"" people discussing, simply talking reserving 100% required second doses versus giving people second future production. made infectious disease ICU last year surgical residency attendings stopped showing would get fucking mad seeing heroes work signs. told icu nurses pissed dont even get park close hospital yet attendings left high risk ""telerounds"" I'm scarred life. ptsd. 200,000 debt person dispensable job essential.

&amp;#x200B;

The nurses seeing humans dispensable jobs somehow essential judging it, asked plan ramp up. Considering way things gone, thought may hit ground running bit faster. one hand, yes standards higher someone position. letting us way bad example. hand, humans humans humans. lot problems would avoided expecting anyone else expect ourselves. People fuck up. plan predicated people fucking great plan. [Vitamin deficiency plays huge role severe comparing statistics super sunny state Vitamin deficiency much less common northern state idiotic begin with. Yeah neither. I’m vaccines, don’t trust speed done. I’ll wait data get year two. high risk category would probably get though. Wow, Canadian, jealous.

We happy get 250K Pfizer 168K Moderna vaccine delivered month (which might take first week Jan consume all). Even accounting population proportions, still small fraction US doing.

Congrats fellas. Do’t take unnecessary risks this. thoght. don’t NEED going somewhere around people right now, don’t. Open managing testing, tracking, reporting honestly? 

Florida first stop offical COVID reporting professionals tried report actual data, person role fired, later home raided arrested - refusing manipulate data dishonestly. 

Like, course one getting sick dying COVID never report document it. Got mine yesterday. injection site pain, fatigue diarrhea major symptoms. Yep, personally think multi year immunity. Let’s hope mutations don’t ruin us. something paying quarter billion, reason others stupidity, irks would anyone pushing panic button.  That’s realistic places,including US. second one bring full body chills roughly 24 hours body reacts way mine fathers towards vaccine. clinical trial Moderna, Pfizer. reaction first dose. experienced full body chills second dose, side effects really People encourage wear masks, goes away without vaccine, it’s hoax LITERALLY killing people say bad things you’re committing incivility bot removes comment. bots real life stop stupid behaviour. Man, really hate needles, thanks comment. 

I obviously would get vaccine regardless, reading people's experiences starting give anxiety. Can't wait ""the death reductions fake"" arguments. Yeah actually look car crash deaths heavily traffic'd areas crashes fatalities many crashes heavy traffic going fast. Whereas rural areas without much traffic see fatalities people go flying road 85 tree. driving places like Los Angeles NYC basically sit traffic breathing pollution, likely die even moron hits you. Non smoker, non obese, no
Asthma heart issues? Low chance issues. think you’ll die covid fly? Plus numbers still out, feeling we're going find lockdown killed much people saved, people younger overall greater number life-years lost lockdown virus. turns true hope see lockdown supporters prosecuted geneva convention. I’m healthcare worker. got hospital work at. Nah, I'd pretty fucking sad responsible, way, grandmothers death. US third nation vaccinations per capita right now. 

However, UK little twice many Canada lacking behind 1/3 US'. probably early judge since contrast numbers still early stage. remeber people making fun relgious minorities still celebrating covid, reality us teh same. Give enough carrot risk it.

Ultimately, way get rid homelessness disallow it. Otherwise, always people living tents alleys. way disallow reasonable place go. think public figures shots publicly make difference. conspiracy theorists say thy given saline such. shake head wait line shot. rate April later. know America 100m members congress. Huh...I guess visiting South Africa then. live NYC perhaps. Heh. How’s protection two required shots? mean, point ask Bill Gates run microchip impla.............. ok sorry, I'll stop now. motive state it’s always been: control.

Control fundamental reason state exists begin with. Statism authoritarian ideology gives rise entity government (the state), government institution fundamentally defined supposed right authority.

If individual organization doesn’t authority, isn’t government — simple logic.

So, given definition, really difficult imagine malevolent, financially &amp; ideologically motivated state actors abusing authority &amp; creating economic crisis *on purpose* order justify imposing authoritarian social control profiting massively process? 

Because that’s difficult imagine wouldn’t recommend reading further.

Of course townsfolk don’t benefit driven poverty, governing class sure fuck creating artificial dependence means never provide quality service, sure hell won’t lowering taxes, rich get richer middle class disintegrates poor remain helpless dependent.

History littered shit, place.

In fact, considering powerful influential people planet ridiculously obsessed perceived problem overpopulation losing iron grip society, creating exacerbating economic crisis provides ideal opportunity start implementing system offers social credit economic incentive exchange things like children, criticizing state social media, moving far outside house even leaving house lockdowns solve climate change, etc.

Unemployment benefits strings attached, thing free money all. 

Just imagine extent could easily pull strings manipulate habits opinions hundreds millions, even billions people offering money need survive, free, teeny weeny terms conditions, nothing much think bother reading fine print — case point, new stimulus bill.

If you’re asking end game fuckery, it’s simply global governance plus shiny new form social organization called technocracy.

Even doesnt eliminate transmission risk almost CERTAIN reduces it. sooner get vaccines protect lives vaccinated prevent new infections.  Singapore? expect ranks top 10. realist seems pessimist optimist optimist pessimist. It’s realistic expect 18m doses holiday people don’t leave pajamas 2 weeks.  Congrats! dropped countries locked winter too. 

Also embarrass switch positions like that? Overweight vs obese determined BMI. BMI determined calculating height vs weight. definitely matters tall are.

For example, you’re 6’6 weigh 215lbs, BMI 24.8. That’s higher end “normal”, i.e. overweight obese. 

Alternatively, you’re 5’10 weight 215, BMI 30.6, meaning you’re technically obese.

You could 6’6 weight 215lbs, gut, healthy weight size, regardless nationality deemed acceptable given culture (or well clothes fit, matter).

With said, BMI doesn’t account weight distribution fat mass vs muscle mass, height weight. could 6’6 215 huge fuckin gut wildly unhealthy, could 6’6 215 absolutely jacked world class athlete 10% body fat.

It’s black white “he gut he’s hope looked well sending watching side effects general people like us get vaccinated That'd fucking funny though totally something trump admin would request think right. Totally anecdotal work one larger hospital systems state already started vaccinating people volunteered help administer vaccine (the people paper work, etc) system used pumping people fast enough. voluntary sign age groups they've allowed sign met capacity yet. plan originally vaccinate volunteers capacity decided - kind kicking volunteering! Lesson learned.

Also, say sure state anywhere close updated reported numbers - vaccines done work reported entire state. first dose far important far gives efficacy. Even half vaccinated entire population instead would still end pandemic restrictions such. need Debby downer. Everyone gets vaccine fucking aware need come back second dose. unique COVID vaccine. full list many samples country sequenced? leftovers could always donate poorer countries.

This America, let's slow now. Yeah, don’t get wrong. I’m optimistic. roll seems way slow. sure true, read would receiving 125,000 vaccines week Pfiezer. Hopefully Moderna similar number, won’t get us anywhere fast. mandarin spot-on. packaging weight size accurate. 
 
This Chinese Mfg fake. am, better judgment. low risk work home really worried myself. It’s high risk older people life insisting getting together, I’m tired fighting it. get it. funny though. Thanks. hoping people get ones skeptical see nothing worry soon. get vaccine right make people comfortable it.

a handful doses given high profile celebrities visibility going deprive anyone massively removes sadness, thank you. ribosome ""consuming"" mRNA degrade it? naturally degrade time/heat?  drove hospital house last night seeing 3 ambulances 15 minutes pass sure enough 4 fire trucks lined 3 tents normally parking lot.

Yikes, sounds like place circus. don’t think. So... article: “Pfizer accept federal funding help develop manufacture vaccine, unlike front-runners Moderna AstraZeneca.” reasonable people r/Coronavirus ? pinch must dreaming ""Because Nationalist Defense Production Act never activated force production PPE?""

Really dude? let's honest Japan realistic chance assault mainland usa, best could hope control pacific via naval superiority carriers destroyed pearl harbor. Possible get card showing got vaccine wear mask? Restaurant owners open vaccinated people maybe? Yes, 50% efficacy age groups single dose. also takes 1-2 weeks reach that, depending lots physiological factors. feel like that's important many getting Moderna today thinking leave mask trash way out. Yes  None present soon ready vaccines approved tested properly children. Dont get wrong last pandemic also started US. Could maker 2nd Gen COVID 19 Virus also origin first Gen? No. Mutations happen frequently viruses spread like this. reason believe vaccine also protect mutations.

Things going get better return normal year, sooner rather later. rookie numbers....... sigh It'll interesting see quickly daily case counts fall. Didn’t think hope removes sadness, think might misinterpreted footnote. think refers infants reaching age, simply refers infants first birthday quarter. that's hoping see here.

They're starting get approved, means standard 2 full doses 1/2 dose full dose. Congrats. read testing safety, efficacy since already established. it’s still going quite time.    Good responsible person, counts. Seems like rare quality days. remember going pizza time. Felt INCREDIBLY uncomfortable place heaving, clearly students returned, well gaggle deliveroo/Uber eats drivers kept coming restaurant pick stuff up. thank reply. Look badly americans dealt this. So. Much. Winning. Fwiw chuckled *self-references Thanksgiving nearly catastrophic US many predicted. Despite 4/10 traveling, percent positive reduced last week cases seem reducing slightly (or least flat). US nowhere near good position least they're seeing 300k+ cases day following many people visiting other. think Christmas guaranteed make huge difference either. people need time alone. much harder can't get house. safe, would add goggles. key want minimize time indoors others. Outside always much safer. person anaphylactic reactions before. haven’t seen specific allergy mentioned. people really looking forward partying much? want visit bf safely lol aren’t killing anyone.

They sounding alarm hope people listen.

The healthcare system nationwide given much past 9 months, size able portion American people used effort justify less should.

The nurses take extra work long, sounding alarm like spillway letting water instead whole damn dam breaking. That's plain vanilla regression. didn't, said ""no"", meaning article included. Reference reinfection ultra-rare please? partnered Oxford University. preeminent intellectual institution world. I’m bit skeptical many issues vaccine? actually posted explain what’s wrong it. 73-million under-18's country, 22% population. 

So leaves 78% vaccinated EVERY PERSON country got vaccine. 

Of course, that's going happen. 

The latest polling says 20% Americans say they'll refuse vaccine. 

If holds true, we'd 204-million Americans vaccinated available everyone currently eligible (328-million total population - 73-million under-18 - 51-million say take it). 

That gets us 62% vaccinated. 

Of course, trials underway older kids. can't figure sure trials safety, include efficacy data either. 

In case, think herd-immunity June quite long shot, even things go well enough give every American wants one access vaccine.  Deaths lagging indicator. well established. Deaths follow increases cases. rather cherry picking use individual days. instance, yesterday, deaths Orange yesterday 26 Orange 58 Los Angeles County. Los Angeles 6 straight days decline deaths today. 

The ICU trends nearly matching per capita now. matter weeks Orange gets comeuppance. That's ultimately made choose drive -- well, got fall realized going shitshow postponed. rapid antigen tests good confirming positives SYMPTOMS, hit miss asymptomatics pre-symptomatics. truly quarantining (literally house arrest, outside contact) least 7 days, rapid antigen test gives good results. idea self-isolating talking neighbors mailbox meeting dashdoor uber delivery ppl, possible could've gotten infected strangers, especially region covid raging control double digit positivity. ..... realize entire world (for part) failing. also realize things getting better. cannot see that, need help offer. Self-reflection great thing. Set pride aside see failing, improve, seriously want to, will. rest fail place truly accept try.

Also likely American variant UK thing is, lot high risk people (elderly younger people chronic illnesses) can't remain physical isolation indefinitely. need regular medical care, much in-person, every time receive in-person medical care, break isolation exposed public. July...cause admin turned offer Pfizer buy There’s ton things rethink given emergency, it’s hard. Funded it, promoted it, pushed FDA, distributing across nation record speed.

Also lmao cares? gonna stop going hospitals? Good ration shit right anyway. Well, username checks out. Glad survived. wouldn’t trust anything Chinese government says. know something think, oh course makes sense. never even considered question flu vaccine impact different strains targeted at.

We’re position roll viable vaccines widely quickly possible. deaths 11,913,203 cases 1 4900. garbage last time plowed list, HCQ CoVID denying crowd moved onto ivermectin I’m certain good data come since last looked.

The second HCQ proved work I’ll team HCQ, cause that’s part team science.

If HCQ worked President would used it.

The people saying HCQ works people think disease caused demon sperm, people think AIDS fake, people believe evidence based medicine, people think masks don’t work.

It’s complete BS. think math using 1 million 10 days rate 100k vaccines per day. Extrapolating (but taking account anything else) would take 3,300 days vaccine every American.

Really simple. someone covid antibodies, still transmit covid?

For example someone covid recovered months ago exposed someone covid recently, would still able spread disease others even though weren’t reinfected? fear going get lot worse ever gets better literally said easter day started rolling vaccine I've shocked happen sooner year given PPE shortages. could ban passenger trains Spain guess.

Seems like well that. PM’ed look John Hopkins “Are flattening curve” map, many/most states showing green, showing they’re side peak, going down. Pretty encouraging honestly, we’ll see Christmas gatherings bring. Yes, coughing ejects viral particles much higher velocity/speed, viral particles likely penetrate mask compared speaking. think I've heard anyone position authority describe way. ""Sharing meme means friend share 5 people share 5 etc"" obviously taking consideration logistics numbers stay same, like said before, virus mutates, new vaccination need created thus restarting timer herd immunity every single time new vaccination/mutation occurs (as currently flu occurs every year). 

The simple logic puts us following conclusion:
1) wearing masks indefinitely
2) social distancing indefinitely
3) please someone provide evidence case Never easy find parking spot. Pandemic not, guess. has, many cases, acted catalyst break-ups may already cards, especially previous separate routines served mask problems. “I think reasons people divorcing necessarily changed. always underlying current ‘I'm unhappy home’. think brought focus domestic arrangements really much sharp focus would ordinarily be.”

Plus asked trump step down. pointing out. arguing anyone’s emotional feelings Mormons. system produced lowest rates starvation human history. bad things still happen doesn’t mean isn’t still superior system alternatives.

That first * point actually wildly wrong. classified ""starvation"" famine due economic factors seen such. Take example fine work Mike Davis late Victorian holocausts. live capitalism dominates world. honestly think heard ""econ"" 101 defenses rebuttals every single day adult life? psychopathic say disrupting global markets supply chains could lead devastation pandemic? What’s psychopathic complete naïveté nothing could possibly go wrong shutting global markets.

It blatantly obviously so. enamored arbitrary system posting defense half million countrymen dying needlessly. would tell greater economic freedom served laboring hacienda system united fruit provided bananas cheaper. abhorrent insanity act isn't. Sure... let’s go back 50 years change things. Let’s spend next 50 years finding better system. acting like could completely switch global economic system 3 months absurd

What china, vietnam, every country totally eat shit do? I'm calling global communist revolution merely putting human lives numbers computer, damage caused by. actual goods anything, speculation upon goods people money could ever spend.

I hope case, honestly, talking roll 100 million doses 100 million days. country could manage logistics face masks sanitizer six months advanced notice somehow going accompish this? hope sake human lives true. reason reported favorably readily apparent, again, give praise mammon almighty market. 

I know probably waste time, really, loved one dies going say ""well least listening market signals""? die wish invested bitcoin made friends? perfectly obvious system thresher live now, better world possible. Yeah that’s enough get back normal imo point exactly. going stop traveling seeing family/friends every years there's new pandemic? guarantee see another Covid-19 type virus within 10 years. there's Covid-22 Covid-23 Covid-19 vaccine respond, lock again?

The precedent set scares me. Dang one worst strawman arguments I’ve ever seen. Take care vaccines declared effective no? would need buy everywhere won’t happen NIMBYs cities oppose reasons stated above. would end happening going route work-camps set remote places populations could concentrated goalpost moved again. wear masks 100 days going forward. yep vaccines mean nothing (we still distance), socially distance get tested negative. Get it?  people follow science, need follow logic!  still ""asymptomatic"" course. Unreal Well isn’t 1940’s, yes, piling together whole countries efforts technological prowess needed make vaccine fast actually worked, know, crazy happen governments work together. 
They gave fucking doctors first also, although they’re treated like shit terms pay hours, kind important certainly soldier police officer comes current times—I don’t think they’d risk bad vaccine. ITT: Reddit PhD's argue someone actually PhD subject matter discussed...

SMDH... really understand saying you. one sure people already seeing friends family capacity. I’ve seen parents 2 friends since thing began. extended family outdoor gathering excess 20 people mask prefer .

Like woman literally catch yet still believe pandemic real? don’t think mental gymnastics going - entire town bad case marshmallow brains. 20,000,0000 isn’t thing fuckkk moron. I’m still confused manufacturing personnel aren’t list first groups getting vaccine. fully agree medical workers front line works, manufacturing personnel actually making vaccines. seems short sighted. Members Congress born 90s. Stanford dudes old. Doesn’t compare. guys always mean us get point no. government capacity (and do) every right upset making so.

We species developed vaccine. elected representatives approved vaccine. elected officials interest ensuring health people. 

We every single right upset ones playing politics another three thousand us die. supposed shining city hill. wealthy powerful nation history world. It’s completely utterly unacceptable sufficient funds allocated distribution prior approval. 

Being grateful complaining thought process respecting parents whatever deity believe in. elected people many working interest. doesn’t bother don’t know will. feel lucky vaccine, absolutely without doubt feel way. seems like miracle. that’s different expectations associated leaders. Please don’t call people upset “spoiled”. People dying, potentially family, doesn’t need happen. deserve capacity better.  answer , Buddy hundred? even. Maybe 1-3 US Go check reported deaths time see dip. ask makes sense context argument. ok Ok yes obviously that's peanuts her, but...

1. call hoe.
2. least something time government (who's responsibility look well citizens) job. 9924 LA. 3123 Orange. 0.988 per 1000 LA. 0.985 per 1000 Orange. Essentially same. Protection looks like starts getting decent 12 days first dose (of pfizer vaccine)  Yep, agreed anyone downvotes absolutely insane  Ah actual clinical experience gives frame reference uncommon condition is. Since use word troll assume like 20 working bachelors biology something like that. Congrats. wear 2 masks, idk science behind don’t think it’ll anything bad you. point, care elderly ones dying. true pandemic ""triage"" need look younger generation. widespread, free rapid testing important. Imagine could hit drive test station results phone hours later. They'll get eventually assumption won’t able spread long. Currently you’re able spread 2-3 days symptoms 10 days after, call 10 days fun. vaccine you’ll spreading/shedding days. leaves lot lower chance spreading others. 

Though you’re 1,000,000% right shouldn’t still wear masks. Saying won’t? I’d imagine tabloid-like media trying find anti-vaxxer celebrities. yet post sympathy people denied downplayed virus....ok. bye You’re crazy. We’ve locked since March, haven’t seen anyone. family state, usually visit holidays, year. family isn’t gathering, still are, wife’s family still holding normal Christmas Eve gathering, though don’t think everyone attending normally would. Especially AI machine learning He’s already critically ill. don’t give monoclonal antibodies critically ill patients trial data trended toward harm subset. USA holding #1 often American Basketball Team Olympics. MFW statists argue who's less authoritarian Yes issues here.I born 60s, parents 30's.The values people met growing seem disappearing alarming rate.

Some people seem oblivious this,some pretend others fabricate beliefs convince alternate reality. 
For me,as 54 years frankly I'm scared fuck. I'll happy vaccinations local level Thx Moderna PR agent number 25.

I kidd

I late 30s healthy get mine several months. killing Ahhh, best friends parents must related brother. Crazy world works?! need another 400 million, right? Covid converted people reasonably risk tolerant bunch bubble wrapped Howie Mandel’s. (I - repeat - advocating covid precautions. I’m stating people’s risk tolerance severely dropped due pandemic). 

People truly underestimate much getting vulnerable vaccinated does. 20% vulnerable vaccinated 95% vaccine ..... deaths drop comparable really bad flu season. really take us much closer pre-pandemic normal life. 

Yes, still *some* risk least vulnerable 80%. think average persons risk assessment covid heavily skewed (rightful) extreme risk vulnerable 20%. vaccinated ..... hopefully start see community risk change people start become tolerant said risk. mean, get flu vaccine every year yea? owe others read origins virus.

Evidence points localized transmission much earlier thought Jan-March, likely cover China save face. probably escaped nearby Wuhan virology lab. studying bat Coronaviruses lab. 

It's probably intentional release, still major screw without transparency. Florida. vaccinating 1a frontline healthcare workers associated hospital system. 

1a category Healthcare providers working private urgent care clinics daily see covid positive patients sick visits swab 200+ covid rapid tests day clinic eligible get vaccinated time. Basically, would hospital affiliation order sign that. trump... government general well known things already 10x cost 1/2 speed. aren't! constantly staying home, too! asked RN thought also valid question. probably semantics, I'm interested know single dose offers protection. wonder people think immune create dangerous situations. would qualify BAM, unless super morbidly obese, isn’t. Nothing could done him. Please feel crazy. FIL died COVID early pandemic we've home constantly. Please know making right choice. time know safe even 2 weeks after. :( feel much feeling crazy though! don’t need herd immunity covid need hospitalizations low stable. Dude, ""Scrubs"" reruns... Even cases essentially relative population still validates point week ago relaxation rules Orange earlier year worsen rates. again, mortality rate dramatically lower Orange. keep saying mortality lags, relaxation Orange took place months ago. effect would already felt. Bottom line zero evidence relaxation worsened results. Again, it’s well established credible science proving current individual lockdown measures real impact infections mortality. Even forcing people leave homes varied effectiveness depending upon dense housing is. New York Cuomo said back April 600 cases Manhattan patients 100% home isolation 4 weeks still became infected. seems logical assume ventilation apartments style dwellings. even staying home sure path safety. What? see one MRT wearing masks. Taipei?

When walk MRT station, guard gate stops entering wearing mask. sometimes another patrol inside also enforces mask policy.

Lastly, ~$500 fine caught without mask on.

Thanks amazing news! explains Republican administration's plan Covid response along. Simply make everyone homeless- boom, instant isolation compliance. sad. Blue good color children.

Sadness works like pH scale. There's positive, neutral, negative. Guess this? I'm well aware Bednar is. may one 12, he's still considered mouthpiece. watched Utah neighbors go quarantining using Bednar's rant reason stop masking staying socially distanced. watched numbers rise exponentially Bednar wholly blame, certainly help give voice screaming lost freedoms grandmas grandpas dying. dangerous belief hold.

just he’s idiot mean doesn’t deserve chance healthcare anyone else. don’t treat morality.

that’s one slippery fucking slope go Good. hope citizens get it. covid vaccines covered system emergency use authorization. Regardless feelings Trump... Trump right one.

Feels like yesterday story ""it ready next summer earliest, Trump idiot."" arguably administration's greatest achievement basically one even giving credit due. 

And no, think early mishandlings mean credit deserved now. means vaccine pulled even less time might preparation. 

The fact we're even seeing headline right darn impressive. Got mine Friday, felt like monkey back. I’m changing Covid routine time yet, I’ll gladly run errands family stuff like that. latest reports I'm following vaccines prevent covid infection (not symptoms). appear working intended.   give businesses ability require employment/patronage. Anyone without medical reason eventually inconvenienced enough take vaccine. Well prepared vaccines quickly available January. rules already broken people already complacent. guess anything though, Thanksgiving really kick started all. People south stoopid lol sure I'm following, sorry?

If I'm 30s diabetes, comorbid condition, get covid die, that's almost definitely fault covid, diabetes. like half people least one comorbidity? Sure diabetes contributed, I'm sure means count.

If stab you, bleed death clotting disorder, pretty obvious died stabbing, right?  Gotta test first, restrict international movement, restrict internal movement, wear masks/contact trace.

US test shit May June, barely restricted travel (domestic international) done alright masks. Doubt there's meaningful contact tracing Well fact people vaccinated right instead 2021 makes optimistic. never expected vaccines would end year wonder antivaxers getting louder Yes. Fun. ""my logic"" mean facts statistics, apparently yes, is. point? Stanford dudes work home. think people bother wear mask / wear properly going get shot? gave corporations already seeing record profits (not revenue, PROFITS) TRILLION+ tax cut. corporations spent tax cuts stock buybacks C-staff bonuses comp packages, enriching shareholders, board members, executive staff. 

They pushed interest rates continue kept artificially low (continuing 2008 financial crisis), despite economy supposedly well. left room Fed adjust interest rates downward stimulate economy (their preferred method) event another crisis. Low interest rates means stock market gets pumped investors seeking yield can't get bonds, turn stocks...great shareholders, terrible average first quarter 2020, wealthiest 10% American households owned 87% stocks mutual funds, according Federal Reserve.

The government absolutely support people financially, taxed wealthiest 10% benefited TREMENDOUSLY last 50 years expensive bottom 90%. going trickle you, fucking morons...EVER. 

**Wake fuck up, robbed.** also can't work home urgently need respond calls. Cool logic norway world's best country That’s pretty low numbers  You’ve crossed line rational talk think swallowed Covid manage get mucas membranes probably fine? goal minimizing death toll pandemic 

That goal health ministry health professionals, country whole. otherwise, following logic, makes sense ban traffic eternity avoid traffic accidents, lock people home forever avoid getting skin cancers, divest ""non essential"" budgets, culture, travel health ministry. probably increase life expectancy quite lot measures.

As said post, real goal countries winning worldometers death per capita charts, somehow became measure success, providing best quality life citizens large.

We're going book cruise May 2022. last cool thing pandemic cruise good time mutates enough new strain respond antibodies last strain. 

Round 2 suckas! MuSt LoCk EvErYtHiNg Doooowwwwwwwnnnnnnnnn I'm huge fan IV myself, I've done loads blood tests past. said, vaccine injected intramuscular? find little easier handle least. kiss stranger right mouth! 

pretty sure could get something worse covid wrong person. come 2 months number? took 10 days 1 million people, take 180 days 18 million people? that's 6 months health care workers alone. (Assuming want vaccine, imagine accurate, still... that's way 2 months health care workers, no? Especially since need second doses.) hope comment come back haunt us trade covid HIV? Sorry don’t agree. I’m US citizen generally maybe critical current government, US seems well. I’m Netherlands living Japan, Japan Netherlands nowhere near US terms vaccination. Netherlands already received vaccines won’t start January 8th(!!!!) Japanese government quite quiet generally. 

Be critical, don’t overdo it. government great work (albeit mainly state governments hands guess), happy :) think people underestimating threat posed new variant, often claiming, said, vaccines also efficient variant new variant less deadly.

That's probably true that's forgetting threat covid-19 bas never mortality rate per se mortality rate + contagiosity + duration sick + long term symptoms.

If put equation, 70% contagious bad news. could make health systems overload ; could also make virus progression faster capacity vaccinate.

That's true. Floridians 65 older first **in general population** vaccinated COVID-19, first doses administered soon Monday, Gov. Ron DeSantis said signed executive order ensuring older Floridians first general population receive vaccines. **Health care workers** people long-term care facilities, vulnerable virus, **are treated already, DeSantis said state administered 70,000 shots already.** Ahh makes sense. meant rapid test short turnaround time, like kind could get point care results within hour. often false negatives PCR.

Don’t eat nationalist BS feeding you! call exactly what’s happening tens thousands people across US, regardless race, due global pandemic.. due hospitals literally choose patients higher likelihood surviving.

We know. Shame you. Stop it. There's strong history black americans getting sub-standard care hospitals. knew this, healthcare providers know this. I'm sure that's happened not, thing.

It's probably something always back mind whenever need care. I'm sure strapped particular hospitals right now, patient, especially one doctor tells well enough go home, probably take word.

It looks pretty bad hospital patient gets re-admitted &lt;24h later.  Disagree. goal eradication herd immunity via vaccine, especially it’s matter months vaccine reaches enough people. Let’s give Covid chances mutate! believe does, he's talking vaccinating elderly, 75 older, essential workers, violates CDC phase 1B recommendations. never thought I'd say this, agree DeSantis. Yeah find fascinating like I'm New Zealand whenever cases know person caught world particular strain came from. 

I find absolutely fascinating say person caught covid person lump people cluster. able without genome sequencing. Also great low number cases know need react. 

Obviously time sad people's lives/wellbeing. also goes back people taught school residency. old stodgy doctors taught things like school continued.

Pfizer helped setting trials manufacturing! also third largest country population world. American food reputation amazing outside US itself. Non white = color. thing. Democracy. explain lack surge cases though? 

I think ever slight rise cases due Thanksgiving, superimposed much massive winter surge wonky data collection around holidays, almost impossible see data.

While article saying right on--less people admitted hospitals versus times pandemic--and that's big problem, would happened without Thanksgiving given already emerging cases/hospitalizations curves.

## Abstract

It recently hypothesised Vitamin K could play role COVID-19. aimed test hypothesis low vitamin K status common characteristic patients hospitalized COVID-19 compared population controls; low vitamin K status predicts mortality COVID-19 patients. cohort 138 COVID-19 patients 140 population controls, measured plasma dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated Matrix Gla Protein (dp-ucMGP), reflects functional Vitamin K status peripheral tissue. Fourty-three patients died within 90-days admission. patients, levels dp-ucMGP differed significantly survivors (mean 877; 95% CI: 778; 995) non-survivors (mean 1445; 95% CI: 1148; 1820). Furthermore, levels dp-ucMGP (pmol/L) considerably higher patients (mean 1022; 95% CI: 912; 1151) compared controls (mean 509; 95% CI: 485; 540). Cox regression survival analysis showed increasing levels dp-ucMGP (reflecting low Vitamin K status) associated higher mortality risk (sex- age-adjusted hazard ratio per doubling dp-ucMGP 1.50, 95% CI: 1.03; 2.18). conclusion, found low Vitamin K status predicted mortality patients COVID-19 supporting potential role Vitamin K COVID-19. also quite stories patients dropping dead soon release hospitals, though seen numbers. 

I wonder extent result prematurely releasing patients little bit better due hospitals overwhelmed. Would patients released early March? don’t go try let us know works out. think puts phase 1c.

I'd argue COVID vaccine manufacturing moved 1b least. like huge group people, they're critical rest vaccination effort. One outbreak manufacturing facility would cost tens thousands doses, more. Lol brand idiot you? ICU capacity usually 60-70% isn’t pandemic crippling city. Again, obviously medical professional. Bye now! 😘 virus transmitted patient 0 bat. Bitter much?

If interest you, go read something else... Yup. I'm desperate travel somewhere. Anywhere. Please God let get plane go somewhere interesting! Removing comment references scientific study, moderators censors, moderators USA 73% obese overweight. simple search shows diet-related diseases number one killer country actual pandemic. wouldn’t many COViD deaths people weren’t Most, all, essential vaccines given free Mexico. required children vaccinated get school. ""Stable"" critical care means patient requiring active lifesaving assistance. important marker critical care someone unstable ICU unlikely improve short order. 

That is, suggesting ""stable"" means 'good', fact means 'not actively deteriorating'. 


If vitals stable quite likely see clinical improvement. example, mother ICU originally unstable required active interventions every hour maintain blood pressure, re-start heart twice, maintain O2 desatted. little clinical improvement day. Overnight first night stabilised - still critically ill. next three days every marker severity improved significantly. Brain inflammation went down, hypoxic cardiac damage healed, blood pressure improved, kidneys returned full function lungs stopped aggravating. Unfortunately damage done, went requiring hourly lifesaving intervention first day taking 18 hours withdrawal ventilation final outcome - marked improvement would occurred unstable. 

In short stable improve - unstable path improvement via stabilization. Although racism rampant healthcare anywhere, there’s lot nuance argument. many times it’s easy say “systemic racism” describe events may actually issue classism (which correlated also separate issue), overall improper care facility, anecdotal instances this, rather studies attempt lay real evidence. words many times tragedy like strikes, immediately take face value based claims headlines, apply larger issue without considering scientific process attempt hold dear.

She discharged says true. medical charts time can’t lie. easily corroborate story. definitely plausible racism occurred. It’s also plausible doctor, frustrated direct repeated request opiates middle opioid epidemic ([which studies show potentially harmful frustrated trying dispute care receiving physician providing care, made short sighted emotional decision discharge her. could focus patients thought risk too. could low beds. idea. could also racist. think additional information clear up. 

If patient - doctor not, black white - came asking Covid care able receive it. we’ve seen that’s true reasons include, limited to, racism. would much simpler guilt tripped wanting go see them! “Don’t!” no!! Taking huge shit past week, sorry loss 2 Weeks Stop Spread!!!


There ways communicate severe threats public isn’t goal post moving. Take hurricane example: threat it’s big powerful storm conveyed, also well thought steps provided people take. like first wave US abusive girlfriend broke second wave US got much abusive girlfriend lol owners. ;) terrible idea opened anyway. set optional student bubbles close friends study together assistance 1 2 parents worried socialisation, struggling focus getting away abusive families/giving parents break.

Ummm never exceeded normal death rates.... summer DVT prophylaxis dosing totally different therapeutic anticoagulation misrepresentation. start DVT prophylaxis nearly every admission regardless COVID status standard care decade. watch video? EMT literally said one gave mouth mouth. One thing don’t mention price treatments, whether insurance covering hours-long infusion process. it’s free, part government response. NYT fails consider possibility people decline offer, thinking may bankrupt (especially heard covid likely kill them). Maybe people understand 1% large number large number?  “Different levels giving fuck”...that’s GOLD said, speaking places known for, visiting impact what’s place known Stop listening media outlets get information r/covid19 like make business, live free country whatever want including get different job capitalists capitalist things. would share labor makes everything possible? matter. capitalist owes labor bare minimum keep working. penny more. hope they're helping. Would great. Damn. even hair salons shut down? ever talking ass? vaccines, rolled out. get yours, party vaccinated folks.

Should great Spring/Summer. Hail fucking corporate keep people severe Covid-19 dying it. snobbish sort attitude sub media decided compare mRNA trials really possible. Oxford/AZ's biggest mistake testing people Covid trials instead relying symptoms like mRNA ones. That’s weird since amazon Walmart stock made quite bit money. percentage federal budget foreign aid? Seems like left 0% ICU capacity number, doc. refused wear mask report contacts too. reason one isolate taking inactivated virus type vaccine? think around 100 million end March April hope know doing, push shit vaccine. Like AIDs epidemic pushed shit drug urgent. point fighting virus minimise deaths.

If power ahead ""herd-immunity"" hospitals overwhelmed, people could survived virus given help left die, people unrelated conditions struggle get treated. Hospital staff also begin lack equipment, puts risk too.

The ideal is, stop via masks social distancing, that. stop it, least try keep growth point hospitals still keep minimise deaths.

The vaccine also route herd-immunity. Trying barge ahead getting many people infected possible increase number deaths covid otherwise, well overwhelm healthcare workers. completely unnecessary loss life physical mental strain ones support us. I'm playing easy numbers game. Joe Biden said, federal government authority enforce mask mandate. Local governments can, federal government can't. That's America works. US cable companies gave us vaccine? biggest worry many 1000000 million already Covid likely level immunity? biggest concern vaccinate TON people already Covid (according CDC around 140,000,000 Americans it) numbers really go vaccinating enough people already still catching it. 

I definitley think Covid already pushed back line. disagree me, let's pretend two people. Person A. Covid already. Person B. Covid. Say one vaccine give, would give to?! 1.5% sounds good, realize 9mil pop. 1% India would 13mil. bit early cheer k vaccinations imo. Vaccines authorized, know, vaccines used, know.  Merry C'vidmas. I’d counter absolutely allow parents government funded research, government getting massive share patent, company scientist engineer develops something company company resources. people involved inventing things need credited share patent. Companies shouldn’t get massive share patent resulting work done entirely almost entirely government resources. grand tradition great country, we’ll leave high dry end. Glad extra-cautious sister!!

Hopefully time vaccine-eligible, might results asymptomatic cases Pfizer Moderna vaccines. monkey studies encouraging, still need find humans!

But now, lot gloomier predictions based assumption vaccines bad preventing asymptomatic cases Oxford/AstraZeneca one turned be... think far pessimistic assumption! current US recommendations balance high risk severe COVID high risk contracting/spreading COVID. Young retail workers get next phase, time 75 older.

Beyond first phases (basically essential workers kinds vulnerable people kinds), think would make sense prioritize vaccinations e.g. 16-30 year olds. Glad you’re doctor. Seems like you’re nowhere close medical professional I’ll continue take advice sad sack’s Reddit. restrictions follow hospital stats. ""I want thing""

""So get thing""

*Replies sarcasm*

Makes sense. okay. looks like protection enough virus.

Merry Christmas too. day fest, okay post drunk, always better angry. Agreed. soon death rates look similar regular flu season death rates, return behavior normal year. think he's talking mrna based vaccine general. mrna vaccines future, turn around time great Spent 7 years Asian country many fancy expats burger joints pale comparison quarter pounder. mcdonald's major cities everytime major city get quarter pounder large fries damn good. It’s metric. So, metric version someone cut half waist down. live world

due people think like make pretty safe bet covid dangerous you. Tax exemption lol... strange story. must’ve torture Jesse Martinez simultaneously Mexican-American murderous anti-Catholic bigot. Dude must’ve suppressing homicidal urges every single family reunion religious holiday entire life LMAO Adjust publication bias though. study showed black people mistreated, would never get published scientists behind study would instantly cancelled BLM. pace US vaccinated 5 years. Need distribution. I'm trial. said study effect two vaccines think problem. NOWHERE say 20% severe reactions. Page 35 37 have, worst, 4.6% second dose severe fatigue age 65. 

And can't add every single % severe reaction categories every age group, that's way reach 20% here. 

And can't imply every severe reaction serious reaction. 

And importantly, can't play pretend doctor reddit pretend know talking about, mocking vaccine seems highly effective.

Oh, media made clear vaccines going suck day two likely. Nobody hiding that. Getting kicked ass temporarily still far better getting COVID. severe case fatigue, headache, muscle pain - serious conditions used fear-monger. like theory! dystopian Same!!! Got first dose yesterday cannot wait ditch N95. Moving plain surgical masks Jan 12 😎 crazy excited. I’m also needle phobic person/nurse passes out. Talk person giving shot. Ask let laying head slightly lower feet, lay min two. Slowly test sitting seeing feel gradually standing. Sure takes little longer, haven’t passed since started neither patients say always faint.
I received Moderna vaccine today, honestly tell didn’t even feel needle tiny bit fluid injected. It’s little 12 hours arm sore lifted gym.
Good luck! this! era definitely world-wide test humanity. fundamental problems world-wide: Wealth inequality; White Supremacy; Environmental Degradation; Hypercapitalism spawn: Corporatist Fascism.

Canada suffers like are, essential Canada continues show rest North America best practices look like.

I lived Canada 9/11 aftermath, eye-opening much Canadians admonishing US. ""Your country acts like bully, bullies get return,"" one way people put it. disagree. people knew also honest admiration long-standing friendship cooperation shared history US, clearly bothered prospect US descend worst version itself.

Unfortunately, that's pretty much we've chipping now. 

The problems anxieties cite real, sincerely believe Canadian Mosaic construct stronger basis get challenging era. Metaphors important, Mosaic interconnected thing. US, still think metaphorical model Melting Pot. Well, hell get melting pot unstable amalgam, and, end, slag heap. 

We need like Canada, keep mosaic intact! analogy smooth brain. like put ass take distribute world. gives confidence speaking important authoritative figures. let door slam way big guy. guarantee claim be.  Oh ok. Thank you.   Pathetic shithole country. Billions weapons bombs, regular folk need bit help left streets. riches country world ladies gentlemen. reason!?! Dude fatality rate sky high like .03% wdym?? sure, employer pressuring guilting coming work even though results still pending. mom got negative test, still nothing me. I’m sticking guns don’t feel comfortable showing work, don’t care pissed is, I’m going expose customers happen test positive. We're probably already there. wife got too. like early Christmas present. biggest fear us getting end hospital dead one care boys. fear eased little today. Electroporation- basically using gene gun. Impressive!  Cheap make yet set make billions it. skinned backs Americans years high drug costs. fact need government money make vaccine doses laughable. knew jamming people single crowded building, making heavy use lungs singing, drinking container water, passing around box everybody else touched, leadership location actively deny virus exists would help spread said virus. No, doubt it. I’m homeless right staying motel days scrounge cash paying cell, mail, storage unit. local shelter full it’s entirely closed due Covid infections major homeless encampment two dozen infections. bigger problem it’s run religious group, lots city/county shelters are. aren’t actually concerned well homeless people often blame homeless people homeless struggling.

For starters, fight attempted assault first tried go shelter help. lost housing (lease non-renewal, struggling get UI, medical bills adding up, economy worsening) went shelter help. nightmare. Several women stayed raped. workers literally accuse prostitute looking suck dick crack. offended- don’t even *drink* town full fancy craft brewers. say disparaging things like “why isn’t family around ? done them?” “if responsible, wouldn’t end here.” 

If ask people actually go shelters it’s like, little trust lot fear. lot them, can’t even keep basic stuff you. forced change scrubs. sleep floor thin blanket. deal people screaming night, homeless people workers themselves. much distrust, it’s hard say okay people administer testing healthcare. 

But also lack resources general. It’s really confusing priority here. can’t get 8 pads week community services (on period, go day) they’re going enough money test everyone scale? May even June, could see realistic, it’s almost January community spread pervasive, it’s already hitting homeless encampments it’s late. point, simply make homeless people vaccine priority, county caseworker already told end summer/early fall best they’re thinking homeless people get it. People suck I've nothing water beyond each.

I hope gets easier somehow! agree, hope people remain respectful actual vaccination period. Like, lucky enough get vaccine early, go ahead see family friends, etc. private. please continue comply mask mandates public safety measures everyone else least opportunity get (whether actually get another story). I'm talking vaccines become widespread, transition period. Absolutely yes lmao. smoking daily beginning pandemic recently(end October)had stop due upcoming surgery February (that might end canceled anyway cuz Covid).
But god, amount anxiety panic experience opposed ridiculous.
I want high make world life manageable mental health. virus doesn’t make people sick keeps circulating gives damn? means nothing. 

People get sick 2 times often similar viruses. 

Statistically unlikely heard handful 2x infections far. What’s lesson we’ve failing learn since March? Wear mask!!! Damn. Tomorrow new article gives different information like everyday.

They need make damn minds Well duh, things change, like putting systems place make sure never happens again.

Its stretch call 'new normal' situation bad California example Flordia? Sure people follow rules/restrictions California Flordia full concerts/events no/almost restrictions all. Or, put another way, Americans put holiday travel plans hold year. AKA life keep sucking till summer best. mean people deciding wear mask flu season isn’t huge change. wouldn’t call “new normal.” son's aunt MD California. telling us months ago state's pandemic preparation measures including comandeering setting aside hotels order turn rooms off-site hospital rooms. Obviously surgical suites ICUs. something like ships docked NYC took less severe cases order let hospitals slightly capacity. taken place yet course list need to. Let’s pretend affecting *some* people. People sides blame Sorry, forgot NYT article access requires paid subscription. Reduce community spread well. percentage vaccinated people feel it’s acceptable stop following public health measures? What’s X% there? Yes, pharma companies absolutely depend basic science advances made academia, advances also need massive investment (and risk) pharma translate clinical practice. theory, could done publicly funded institutions- certainly amount funding currently receive, clinical trials exorbitantly expensive run. system set now, industry relies academia, vice versa, neither claim 99% credit anything.

And argue scientists work pharma (I'm one well), realize basically also spent substantial portion career academia, right? Grad school + postdoc 6 10 years minimum. telling anything taxpayer-funded research already personally experienced. 100% there'll people using 0.1% excuse wear mask I'll whatever fuck want, fucking website tells me. never claimed hospitals would empty. *does* apply hospitalizations; rates hospitalization much lower younger people, pointed out. data link Washington state, shows 60 % hospitalizations age 60. 40 % 60 isn’t scary initially looks, cases shifted younger people, much less deadly epidemic even proportion hospitalizations 60 higher. started talking girl Swansea, looks like visiting while... Wish could smoke. wanna chill home, job still requires work bunch antimask, antivaxx dickweeds think hoax. get random D&amp;A testing every month despite fact legal smoke live. wanna chill out, man. going accelerate. people get this? wear mask part effort touch face also. joke, used chronic nail biter, anymore. Taking measures slow spread provides selection pressure. IDK average, would 29,000 per state. knew would happen. numbers aspirational never detail given distribution would happen first doses. Viruses natural mutation rate. SARS-CoV-2 virus mutate fast something like flu virus. 

What watch mutations reduce effectiveness vaccines. Pfizer said publicly tweak vaccine matter weeks mutation arises. wish he'd bit specific.

I give rat's ass masks stay hospital settings, teams contact tracers busy background.

He knows exactly people mean ask 'normal life' - example able take subway, maskless, bar restaurant, sit plexiglass barriers tables, capacity limits, order whatever like stay long owner let us.

I hope journalist pin it. Yeah, democrats Wow. reach. response pandemic. don’t need anywhere close mess financially 300,000 deaths. say herd immunity strategy, mean:

Actually, responded every time seen it. let Tegnell put dam river, hold river certain level, eventually get huge flow period. better let seep slowly. keep control take care harm society necessary. like forest fires things, make burn little slowly carefully, make burn out. Yes, time must remember vast majority become slightly ill. know big so-called dark number is, lot suggest very, big, says Anders Tegnell.  Even sounds like lot, may one 60 percent get really sick maybe five six need care. smear five-six percent six-eight-ten-twelve months, manageable said form analogies meaning clear - allow slow controlled spread virus eventually herd immunity achieved without overloading hospitals.

Every recommendation made slowing *not stopping* spread number two, western countries (except like NZ, AU) herd immunity strategy - flatten curve. 

Except ones went lockdown specifically halt spread virus. Failure achieve goal thing goal.

Tegnell said Asked journalist Wednesday's press conference Sweden worried asymptomatic people spreading virus, Tegnell responded group relatively small.  working getting rid infection; going work, disease *is* stay. working trying bring infection society much possible, reasonable measures, flatten curve create situation healthcare services continue function,"" said March 25. Tegnell et al. already decided even attempting stop spread virus futile (despite evidence contrary) instead aimed achieve herd immunity allowing virus continue circulate, rate slow enough overwhelm hospitals. March 25th total 104 deaths.

The fact refuse admit strategy tells even know complete disaster.

Sweden's goal achieve herd immunity without overwhelming hospitals. well way achieving goal... enormous cost human lives. Sure helps ease mind! frustrating. I'm sick hearing everyone's reasons simply *have* travel. life death situation, life death reason travel **stay home**. Thanks - quite interesting.

But clarity, comment sarcasm thing. 

I absolutely zero surprise there's shift towards children getting time they're packed schools. Sad getting away abuse issue. Though agree shouldn’t assume anything vaccine covering new strain, assure assuming process rushed. wasn’t, fast tracking common normal clinical trials. It’s like sit start slamming things together hoping works out. study design based SOPs detail run efficient expedited trial indication. Don’t confuse fast rushed. trials fast, never point trying keep up. R/collapsesupport I’m rooting moon point Kk papa Go Costa Rica!! Sure. there’s also optimism considered often ridiculed blocked sub countered doom gloom. That’s issue here.  Come back 3 4 months... Neuroeconomics. Wow. Fucking alcohol destructive  Tell hundreds thousands people streets right now. article tough critique, face, wrong.

But yet, large majority population, is.

Because underlying assumption article **the point avoid becoming infected**.

That never point, point, majority non-elderly, non-immunocompromised people. 

The point reduce death suffering. 

So X number high risk people vaccinated, many us, talk ""risk budgets"". 

We talk risk budgets bad flu season. hardly speak now. gutted pandemic response CDC. funding cuts things like (EPA, FDA, NOAA climate change research). think NASA actually got money space missions, also (climate research etc) got cut. installed corporate asshole leaders agencies (for filled all). dont understand billionaires blame people wearing masks holding covid weddings... started growing keeps bounds better dispensary. mention cheaper. harvested 4lbs $250. I'm Oregon. thing kept saying knows family practices safe protocols like... like lives them

Hearing throughout pandemic one irritating things.

 One household members stopped hanging indoors small group friends. reasoning they're ""being safe"" ""trusts them"". like... comfortable indoors unmasked people live with, responsible trust you! Literally pursuit happiness, sold pennies dollar upper classes happen.  trying classify good food, “American food”?

Regional cuisines dishes like bbq gumbo AMAZING find right joint even mediocre joint. We’re also nation immigrants. medium sized city flyover state go get authentic options pretty much every national cuisine mentioned. know that’s “American food” it’s straight ignorant act like everything pizza, burgers meatloaf need to. crazy. dig around various state sites find it, one example.  closest breakdown somewhere 60+ bucket flips half cases. also see death rates way higher older demographics expected lot people wrongly taking metrics death assuming applies hospitalizations well simply true. And, yes, difference chance hospitalized, also lower younger, percentage people actually hospital age group. old people get vaccinated, people hospital dramatically swing younger. good news half beds taken old people available, notion vaccinating old people means hospitals empty isn’t supported data way shape form. chain link fence analogy actually makes sense droplets represented tennis balls way. Drive through, take-out, delivery. It’s constant us. COVID. weight issue now, COVID. It’s huge vector transmission either. sAy GiLL BaTeS? kNeW would house ""so fucked"" come next week? believe person sure covid sure give everyone? dont understand reaction. really can't summon sympathy people taking seriously thought hoax got sick. Read sorts facts mean real-world applications.

Blocking 99.9 percent droplets doesn’t mean slows spread 99.9 percent. much misleading stuff there. Yes wear mask. aware limitations don’t take unnecessary actually ate places COVID? Drive thru thing still is. man cares knew meant Hi. wanted say hero holding line right now. please don’t hold guilt - scope tragedy responsibility fault. public letting down. Fuck dude. awful. wonder many people situation. Yes, lived, fir long? severe damage three major organs, he’s going live full life. It’s heartbreaking Someone else mentioned thread can’t confident they’re getting downvoted...

I one many scientists helped verify one mRNA viruses phase 3 trial. learned really quickly best approach assume worst case scenario, case, assume new vaccines won’t cover new strains. It’s something figure sequencing carrying observational studies, would extremely unprofessional cocky, way. say NOO way new vaccine won’t cover it. scientist relies data, prove it. can’t data yet, some, point pandemic ever said “oh, we’ve 100% correct idea!”? Never, we’re shit live.

I think unwise say vaccine won’t cover it, equally unwise say will, appropriate testing underway. assure none coworkers said definitely covered current vaccines, just. Don’t. Know. :) $1,000.00 signing bonus pay single day's hospital stay. factory owner, like slave drivers running American corporations, vastly underestimates financial risk people take working face face. Masking becoming commonplace permanently, makes perfect sense. know images cosmopolitan Asian cities pre-pandemic always masked person there? Globalization costs benefits. Wow, dunno get yeah kinda right compare usual years? Maybe celebrate reduction travel instead mad everyone decided stay home  Mutations normal expected. long illness severe escapes vaccine, I'm less concerned.  Yeah. Republicans fucked whole country backwardass ideology: tax cuts rich, deregulation, burning safety nets, destruction pandemic team playbook, purposely planning infect many people possible here, finally employing kneeling luntatic carnival barker trash family. though. actually read tables, 15.8% referencing fever that's 18-55yo 27 (~1.2%) second dose, 2 placebo group.

They actually stratify adverse events mild/moderate/severe, fever/pyrexia one them. use word original comment? much ""direct quote"".

Stop misinterpreting data, spewing incorrect bullshit. idea fuck talking about. stupid put end date it. vaccination finishes 88 days, there's reason keep mandate another 12 days. riot streets healthcare because:

1. countries take 60%+ personal income taxes pay it.

2. countries sort real military defend aggressor, dkn't pay army someone else like US you, spend money healthcare.

3. Democrats want free healthcare EVERYONE, citizens. Americans want pay healthcare illegal aliens country. 

4. better toys, technology, freedom gives us opportunities grow business hobby. want government taking care us whole lives. 

That's why. right concerned, try give tons anxiety 1 person. Remember. Aid ""run out"". *withheld*. purpose. None happen. Yeah, dare people complain shitting milk aisle grocery store. 99% people walk around it. mean imply forced keep non-essential businesses open. meant limit response fundamental *lending/credit* functioning modern economy. 

As Canada places shown, possible close non-essential businesses protect citizenry. fact look NZ AUS economies seem well protected citizens.

It becomes public policy approach, gets capitalism/socialism/mixed economies problems two party systems. conversation outside scope rules sub. leave could done better wish more. Oregon, we're fewer fewer vaccinations day. encouraging. I’m even sure I’d cope wasn’t tripping balls every night sleeping like 8-9 hours People getting reinfected. Grenfell Tower Fire killed 70+ people, fault, fridge initially caught fire, fact whole building covered extremely flammable cladding? part think made people angry most?

Jesus people, use common sense. nothing annoying confidently incorrect doctors. lol he’s saying can’t extrapolate incomplete data

you failed realize (extrapolate) there’re 2 types people despite told 1 type(incomplete data) What’s blind. It’s literally end year donate? needed reach threshold maximize amount money would taxed next year.

Weight dropped it’s pandemic. flowers bloom every season imagine reading 300,000+ these. heartbreaking. wrong. mRNA vaccines available likely don’t stop infection transmission. weren’t designed that.

As long virus keeps circulating, opens opportunity mutations, far far surpassed expected. mean, like already trying.  4 days according surfaces huge risk might well err side caution. thought Fauci vaccinated tho said Santa’s immune never said solely due Thanksgiving, certainly impact kinds social gatherings one primary vectors transmission.

No. Stop it. Stop blurting things fit narrative constructed head look data.

You cite 30% rise cases since Thanksgiving kind proof Thanksgiving caused spike.

You're correct there's 30% rise (roughly 42K average daily increase Thanksgiving today). California alone (a state 12% US population) accounted 2/3s increase (28K average daily increase). Numerous states seen increase, they've seen huge decreases - cases 60 70%.

This simply consistent idea Thanksgiving cause increase. None charts show increase suggests widespread transmission caused Thanksgiving.

Take 5 minutes actually look data stop posting comments ill informed border lying. Oh crap, said customer. Well comes that, it’s time disobey.

I think happening testing positive cases sky high, vast majority people test positive require hospitalization, vast majority require ICU care. people choose get vaccinated? required work people choose get vaccinated? Wouldn’t extend social distancing measures workplace? You’d rather go work mask day get vaccine? 

I see qualm company requiring employees put something bodies, it’s greater good public health, can’t see problem that. 

If still don’t want get vaccine even company requires it, still decide get it, work company anymore. always free make decision yourself, also need accept decisions consequences, like losing job. years

Like fuck bars restaurants open right clear major transmission points? dont want every single bar restaurant go business. shitty trade make.

If right impossible us close non essential businesses think that's reveals fundamental flaw economy. dont think economy dumb. I'm taking general ramping gdp. business closes time cant every aspect business stay closed including debt debt employees?

I see said ""all loans"" pretty extreme. Ive still got job still pay mortgage. think economy defenitiy able handle massive, intentional measured downturn done way avoids millions people businesses going broke.

As seeing ability weather pandemic we're trading thousands lives stop job loss business bankruptcies. Well, small businesses get muscled way courtesy government policy, megacorps always rake new profits.

Enjoy corporate hegemony lockdown enthusiasts wanted. business could earn certain agreed percentage workers ? 🤔 workers always benefit also ? Also post amazon, dunno he's talkin   it’s paywall warning haha bought stock would owners share profits.  Oh mean I’m good wintry place come could put boots gloves back 15 minutes buckets full good day good viruses mutate become infectious, often less deadly. 

As history Spanish flu shows, ""less deadly"" part entirely optional. Florida caught lying numbers point govt raided woman's home pointed guns children try keep accurate numbers shared.  How’s paying them? remember sitting next someone too, never recognized knew was, must Comfort guess customer unable pay, business profit. Yes, considering much pandemic spent high, got point weed started smoking understanding 11 million doses mentioned 1st dose allotment only. sound like kind person never make decision putting gas car food table.  purpose corporations isn’t share, purpose profit shareholders.

We need stop wishing corporations would job government make sure everyone’s needs met.

We need stop angry corporations thing designed do, start angry government requiring little them. 

Corporations voted in. aren’t working us. need stop hoping save us kindness hearts. folks exposed anything Faux News. Unfortunately lot people going read fearmongering headline confirm beliefs Fauci liar, use excuse follow precautions.

What completely irresponsible article, regrettable quotes Fauci. perfect example much media public health officials failed us pandemic.  started pretty early though. First signs leveling like dec10th. That's I'm saying it'll interesting see actually turned corner nationwide holiday Well people ""not putting it"" then, ones putting now.

And think people exercising caution throw wind either assured safe people listening this.

The difference amount collateral damage person able when/if mini maskless les miserables display happens. Depends. cops gonna pull driving influence Herd Immunity? /s Also hairdresser stayed open businesses closed hairdresser magic nobody could catch COVID-19.

I always wondered actually could working. barber twelve months. really need PhD physics think can't make much sense? think makes sense remember stock increase benefits shareholders( whether future) employees. Maybe way giving dividend payments employees too, instead shareholders. Trickle-down actually surging-upwards economics. could come better metaphor probably that's things country now. Profits surge upwards wealthy elite. No, dumb fuck. want people stay home wear mask. look dumb duck right now. Oh... Republican prescription Trickle really tickle?! Southern California sprawling amalgamation humans. Nearly 26 million Southern California alone. California big state. San Bernardino county need ICU bed none available area, low behold there’s bed Central Valley! see logistics there? transfer hospital patient hundreds miles away? California “some” beds, doesn’t mean it’s prudent solution problem. problem Covid19 overwhelming Southern California hospital system. collapses every body needs medical attention, covid, might get proper due attention need. 26 million people. Wrap mind around it. Think consequences. Remember everyone saying worry mutating, mutates ""much slower"" viruses....I member New TWiV: Vincent live stream last night. Texas says: hold beer. Yes, govt's job regulate competition abuses. doubt great job say least certain areas. failure govt appropriately regulate industry failing capitalism, failing government. Giving government control economy going make issue govt corruption worse, better. face surprised think talking UK  Lol first thought referring Gov. Newsom, suppose there’s quite politicians breaking guidelines. Honestly point time think comments like made outside nefarious forces. 9 months come subreddit, top comments always like ""we're going die, going get worse, happen today."" 9 months like that. nefarious actor posing concerned citizen: good job. not: fuck contributing needless anxiety dooming. part problem.  person antibodies breaths virus someone could breathe pass someone else?

What's timeline inhalation passing along somebody? think people would change matter many people died directly impacted them. almost half million people dead covid usa alone. 
Not sure doubling tripling would make assholes change minds behave. 
Their minds might change society entirely broke down, would late. capitalists always willing pay someone less two-dose vaccine 11 million doses equals 6.5 million fully vaccinate people. rest doses still administered second dose couple weeks. Yeah, think it’s reasonable approach 

*but can’t get .....* 

Sorry. room hospital. 


^ would like things go. I’m growing nervous government going let personal responsibility go policy. can’t see Joe Biden Justin Trudeau stepping saying, “Ok businesses, ok restaurants, open sorry small percentage die”, even though **at point** exactly needs done.

No, send people color home ill. women.

Yup.

We worked together earn results collectively deserve behavior. Confirming works means testing exposing vaccinated new strand, happen time. cannot happen lab. I'm guy. Fuck you. Haha Well yeah...if use senior citizen deaths covid are. 

But young person? America valued much wealth create, thus ""work die"" imperative.

And worst thing yeah work gives many people sense purpose even dignity, system designed steal wealth workers transfer almost owners, **AND PEOPLE BRAIN WASHED THINKING THAT'S BE** probably still great news one disgusting comments I've seen long time. Wtf wrong you? want 100s thousands dead people prove point? Yeah clue exactly administering vaccination looks like sterilize, stick in, sterilize slap bandaid on. Sign I'll volunteer, especially bumped front vaccine line. keeping track everything... 

Reckoning days coming... week 1 million people vaccinated. guess depends background. immigrants know agree, disagree. food wherever originate better here, probably won’t hear much it. you’re somewhere food worse, place like garden fucking eden something. friends South America excited shit try food first came. AFAIK mRNA vaccines produced insane daily volumes fairly easily, BMWs long. 

More traditional vaccines rely attenuated viruses quick scale production. math, calculate long vaccinating entire country twice going take, rate. info immunity percentages 1918 pandemic, history repeats, terribly surprising news. sure like Fauci telling thinks handle. worried this. says identified sequenced sample collected *august 9th*

He notes doesn’t appear transmissible significant rise cases noticed. also appears issue vaccines 6 months seems unlikely. Even influenza mutates quicker rate usually takes couple years per strain. 90% vaccination absurd it’s unlikely get considering previous infections Pfizer please article say validated yet, know ""the coming weeks"". OP wrong.

Wishful thinking solve thing. Science will. guys scientists say validated yet. I'd rather operate theory pretend works cofirmed. Gavin Newsom’s fault. Yes, Donald Trump handled pandemic poorly, we’re talking one state particular, case, California, it’s Gavin stupid Nuisance! people leaving state, Gavin!

The thing I’ll say this: may right (I certainly won’t say you’re wrong), don’t think vision you’re predicting happen lifetimes. got downvoted saying another thread truly believe case.

LOL, thank you. made morning better. say ‘America known food’ that’s say doesn’t good food. would say ask someone countries make good food, 90+% non-Americans name 10 countries without even considering America. Burgers favourite food, actually thoroughly enjoy American food. also like spicy wings. 

America good food doubt, point I’ve ever trying make America isn’t KNOWN good food. Businesses (shareholders) charities workers charities. We’re money. 

Everything business benefit labor benefit them. Higher average wage benefits helps retention. Higher retention SAVES money training, on-boarding talent search. 

Generally, happy workers cause fewer problems allowing management focus things like core business. recent analysis reported 91.4% effective preventing symptomatic infections, 100% preventing severe infections, see press release discussions. bad celebrities, sports players politicians think paid more. assuming differences climate culture affect covid evidence makes difference.

As commented I’m sure 

But it. demanded Rem ( drug found zero effect Covid ) etc denied 

Something CT Scan due issues neck etc 

And portions video says “ racist hospital “ something along lines 

Just weird almost political death rattle brushed conspiracy theorists last 10 months. Thanks Fauci, you’ve given legitimacy. 

Holy smokes. end. western country going achieve 90% vaccination rates. mean *expect* us go along like forever? makes sense - daily deaths drop 65+ crowd vaccinated. man, PH elected officials understand *some* risk part life. 

I gotta get today. can’t take crap Christmas Eve.

Merry Christmas all. Let’s hope next one aren’t told .... “stay home, save lives^TM”  *lose* vaccine eventually get it. Lol black. main thread yesterday whole lot people went issues factors here.

She clearly high risk, good state. That's even remotely question.

She shipped die without treatment, but, doctor, heavily invested doing. asking treatments give people position, blaming black reason happening. anecdotally says treating way, said thing, fact...?

I'm sick people framing everything way, also much people fall this. Someone says ""black"" entire topic clearly that, fact. longer nuance reason, ""agree racist.""

Everything happens life &lt;factor think blame really not.

It's sad died, current establishment blame death due covid, doctor letting die black. He'd let patients die case, absurd. Remember said masks effective. don’t believe mutations work vaccine.


I mean obviously drug companies going say work. hope countries refunds contracts vaccines. Per capita measures relevant Sweden compared Estonia. [It's universal truth.

It basically boils medicine dominated mostly white men country others. That's it. divide et impera. one guns riot kept blind propaganda, one ability understand they're getting shafted know want talk people. 

it's easier two group people go war others form common front real tiranny people want look good Sinovac's efficacy 70%, forget selling vaccine worldwide given well Pfizer/Moderna even Gamaleya doing. Ah okay. see. Where’s video? advocate

Not saying bad advice think time started advocating getting M4A passed avoid hell. say that. I'm curious dynamics. I've googling lot stories people needing jobs employers able find workers. first blamed extra employment ended situation change. ""experts"" chalking bunch different things surrounding Covid. suggesting anyone bad lazy taking jobs, acknowledging much everything changed past year.  done home... ya feel? Mine next.! someone speculated heat would slow virus , ridiculed 

So headline creative way avoid saying information correct saying thing Legal system, judicial system, medical system. supremely racist country. white docs treat poor minorities way cops do. Often, kills them. safety net, point. safety net stressed limit,"" says.

And soon break. turning back point, happen within weeks. Sinovac's efficacy 70%... bye bye Sinovac... nobody going use vaccine reinforce systemic racism effect Health? talking preexisting conditions, conditions developed social health care systems. Sure, don’t know yet there’s cases fomite transmission I’m going lose sleep yet Arizona running around yesterday. Yeah, don’t care. live predominantly black Hispanic area. It’s always minorities area act like don’t give fuck pandemic perpetuating massive gatherings cops don’t feel like dealing with. got COVID broke protocol literally never wore mask tried act hard whenever someone asked wear one, wouldn’t expect anyone grieve loss feel sorry. fact, wouldn’t even accept ventilator needed one. could possibly know fomite vs droplet?  Fake know article fomite, got thinking winter hvac. main question remember study virus died quickly higher temperatures wondering furnace making air usually higher 100f help stop hvac spread virus.

I'm super careful fomite exposure myself, clean groceries, use hand sanitizer contact things others might touched, wash hands, etc, I'm still convinced huge disease vector covid. panel scientists asked precautions take groceries one scientists basically said fomite big danger would lot cases. dire situation is, Spellberg says, going get even worse.

The crush cases spurred L.A. County health officials send guidance four public hospitals manages, ration emergency care, reports Los Angeles Times. Instead trying save every life, goal would save many patients possible. means less likely survive would get kind care would usually receive.


So new normal... Can't wait over. different approaches pandemic, mask compliance etc. think that's apples oranges American response understand. intention offend anybody, wanted emphasize people always know body best need carefull medics disregard symptoms. Hey man, sometimes getting forced fly one healthy enough take care cousins. never gotten point, needs get done. scientists vere saying masks work... probably much much more, CDC website data comes strange, update data certain day 9 am. dont actually push update like 3 4 pm, plus places usually dont report vaccines administered 72 hours. seems like u.s. set system naturally set good honest people fail evil selfish one rise top. Wonder produces shitty results. Probably nothing. last months shown us, vaccine verification card system would quickly either forged hacked, rendering system useless. one knows viral load yet research done. Absence evidence evidence absence. Definitely?? Yeah taxpayer money. like triumph private pharma US government literally bankrolled successful projects. shit happens white people too... “But fomite transmission never happens” Natural antibodies protect variety had, vaccine protect mutations. Therefore recommending people vaccine even covid. No, intention so.

Just wanted emphasize always need listen body knows best, medics wrong experience often. 3 unique variants seem share common mutations . However appear different. variants noted due increased transmission. Omg MILLIONS say?

Are like, 5 2020 even over. guys easily hit mark year over.

In early fall, even know would working vaccine, let alone two mid 90s efficacy. Quite impressive whichever way look it. funny people bitched hospital administrators getting vaccinated that's office job too. without administration one order new supplies, coordinate bills etc. 
I guess everyone important right now. Ok wut? 😳 don’t understand isn’t done push treatments small supply?
That’s great idea have. different variant. one detected South Africa looks dangerous UK one. Oh wow. sorry.

Why harsh truth live with?

That’s kind concerning considering unprovoked stroke months back placed blood thinners least year. can’t eat whole lot vitamin K general thousands variants throughout pandemic. That’s normal. thing happened couple newest ones identified contagious. vast majority variants make difference aren’t newsworthy. also may overreaction based UK variant. sudden every new variant cause concern media gets clicks fear mongering reality variants meaningless grand scheme. scholar gentlemen. Look you, creating account troll pandemic. thoughtful. suspect antibodies produced former fight second infection.

welp bode well immunity... seems fact bunch stories British citizens re-infected mutated strain getting original Covid last spring good sign original antibodies (and thus, presumably, vaccine) protective mutated strain. really still pretending variants big deal? wrong. new one probably non-neutral mutations. issues? Still minority people, they're especially loud getting lot attention right now. best way prove safe keep immunizing people people reactions. hope second dose goes well. mRNA vaccines available likely don’t stop infection transmission. weren’t designed that.

NO. Stop trying convey information understand.

The correct statement is: ""We data show whether vaccines stop infection transmission. trials designed test that."" different said.

Scientists actually suspect vaccines prevent infection. [Scott Gottlieb, member Pfizer's board former FDA commissioner said need trials prove this, cannot base policy presumption vaccines prevent infection altogether, absolutely untrue say ""most likely"" stop infection. Deaths, yes. Hospitalizations, no. plenty young people hospitals, least half 65. better outcomes, minus long term shit may end with, notion vaccinate old people restrictions go away bullshit. going make good size dent younger population well. easily summer earliest. That’s start see significant moves back normalcy. fall things look lot better. sister-in-law (a Canadian) convinced everyone family (American) donate charity (for her, UNICEF) send donation receipt card family member. send one card per nuclear family.

HR person fired - put entire staff, families, risk. really. deal takeout boxes wrappings? put food plates back home?  assume I’m Christian? Wth wrong you. think it’s many times media use term lockdown closure shops restaurants, even movements restricted (like Belgium, Germany). Italy, movements also limited days (with exceptions) Haha know, joking (mostly) I’ll wait doses become moving brothel 🥰 Title exactly match content. poster's fault, rather news data date, Moderna expects vaccine-induced immunity Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine would protective variants SARS-CoV-2 virus recently described UK,"" company said Wednesday noted additional tests performed coming weeks confirm vaccine's effectiveness new variants confirm plan run tests confirm activity vaccine strain, broad range potential neutralizing antibodies made possible Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine provide confidence vaccine also effective inducing neutralizing antibodies them,"" Moderna added.

Depending virus long-term, even vaccine, might become convenient way continuing go life usual future scenarios. One might think inconvenient, compared economic shutdown, especially alone suffices... smart. Capitalist Realism: inability think system beyond capitalism going able practical way well mutate millions animals. Every time transmits chance mutate. Mutations generally make virus contagious less potent. something worry controlling limiting. Every mutation relevant needs identified quickly possible. take one vaccine resistant strain strain higher mortality fuck us get lot less money. US cutting funding decades. Oy, nice litterally double masking work. Sanitizing frequently. Still managed catch it. Simply happened frequently me, i've seen eyes way many cases ""you said i'm women"" "" ""he i'm black"" bullshit increasing hate

If black hear kind news, i'd hate white people. literally said have, someone one sub said: ""I'm glad willing sacrifice family friends"" It’s mostly old people. younger people hospitals people serious co-morbidities also receive early vaccine access. 

Very healthy people 65 hospitalized disease even fewer dying. wants take bets covid variants one kills us Look mask wearing social distancing. Get back work fuckers. like Florida’s COVID stats GAO said would cheaper drug discovery happen univerisites ( lot already does, changes federal laws let universities patent discovered made US grants spin companies ) let NIH fund oversee studies medical schools. Pharma firms would contracted produce drugs.

No CEO pay, shareholders pay. money come from? Making drugs expensive.

We find lot basic drug discovery us universities allowed patent spin companies commercialize. Promising companies bought big pharma. university gets cut, turion still rises US taxpayer gets ends, paying basic drug research getting fucked prices. hasn’t proven doesn’t meant isn’t unreasonable assume would level reduce almost eliminate transmission. 

I mean, wore masks getting data masks reduce transmission, even though masks reduced transmission everything else, would different place right now. girl Swansea, girl lives there?

If former... RUN. It’s cause four holidays people gather back back back month apart (cept Christmas New Years). probably won’t get “wave” warnings St. Patrick’s Day unless new UK variant really starts spread US overall LA. Fauci chill way saying “I manipulating data make people want” IDK, maybe consider COVID part correction Scientists also say it’s unlikely life look exactly like 2019 again.

Dear scientists, go fuck yourselves. Political sucide politician give makes vaccine teachers example. kids don’t spread it. military medical personnel fighting CoVID-19, stop duplicate local pharmacist do? opposed lockdowns, might model follow. 

BC started implementing measures second wave even hit. [Labour BC started closing high risk businesses (Banquet Halls, Clubs) also high risk activities (suspend liquor service 10:00 pm). [Also massively expanding contact keep eye sources transmission. 

Then saw spread covid elsewhere, quickly came implemented new measures contain second wave. [By tightening rules around social Plus getting assistance [Federal Government contact 

Then saw spread gyms, specifically fitness classes [they closed left wider gym open new 

[Finally, imposed province wide travel Must new Reddit. think democracts ready go back normal asap give shit wear mask. ""About 12,000 New York City students signed in-classroom learning must receive remote lessons parents failed sign consent forms weekly random testing, school officials said.""

Maybe turn 70% enough. gonna vaccined 1 hundred million people USA? sources pure speculations? People 60 won’t overload hospitals need good analogy vaccine developed year. know based SARS coronavirus mid 2000s research vaccine.

Would like reading building car time finally money time, finally built one? think analogy good enough. I’d even happy gopher nurses, sign people in. Whatever gets us herd immunity faster. Getting bumped line wouldn’t hurt either! 60 overload hospitals.  40 suffer Long Covid. rare.

These two things false.

Sure, people 60 end hospital, they're bulk patients.

Also 'long Covid' ill-defined, typically observed people ill ended hospital. young people get brush day two, many even know they've it. help understand specifically mean that? 

this sentiment commonly repeated I'm unaware two actually work data rate limiting. there’s still people downplaying things. Really sick half country. said start, struggle basic reading comprehension? said good thing reality going explode holidays. REALITY, negativity. Article mentions ""cloth masks"". I'd like know info types masks effective vs. effective? still see bunch people breathable neck gaiters - especially joggers bikers. shot got? 11M allocated, 9.5M distributed far. Remaining 1.5M distributed end today.


1 change million given far. There's way product hospitals people gotten shots. Literally like 10M doses end day. another 4.67M within week, would imagine LEAST much every week going forward (likely ticking 6M end Jan).


We gotta get largest vaccination effort usa history NOW. BTW got info hhs daily briefings YouTube (W Azar slaoui perna), subscribe educate yourself! 😊 trauma Texas trending towards legalizing well. Technically ther 1 2 medical conditions approved for. might take 8 bet within 5-10 years legal Texas too.

Honestly legalizing actually supported sides political spectrum pressure get passed. Fair enough. Good food found U.S. though, argument presenting evidence. Banana wait 2 weeks like lk1380 says, I’m sure Jesus/Santa/your family would understand give fuck. actually really bad.

A week in, limited vaccine supply, already medical professionals constraint, supply vaccines.

In state, doctors slow-walking vaccine reason. We've received hundreds thousands doses, handed less 10,000. weekend vaccinated like 30-50 people per day.

On one hand, nurses tell us system collapse. other, can't bothered work 9-5 M-F vaccinate people... same. Gummy version. Yup, this. Ugh many start research labs campus.

In 1990s us govt passed bill allowing universities commercialize basic research developed originally us grant money requirement give govt price break.

So professor finds something promising. sign licensing deal university spin company. company often bought bigger firm really promising. US taxpayer grants generated initial research could tens millions dollars still charged full price whatever comes market.

This works, chemistry grad back late 90s.

Do value safety freedom? probably super cautious Covid regardless risk profile, Dem policies also appeal you.

Do value freedom more, even means increased risk? willing continue normal life. Also GOP policies probably appeal you. Ok, can't read this. phone handle google translate.

Was reinfection get infected multiple strains simultaneously? Hospitalisation started get worse November cases started increase October. acceleration thanksgiving (which end November). get progressive enough area start getting hippies believe crystal healing essential oil MLM schemes. people dumb enough that, IMO, we’d benefit indeed refuse vaccinate died off. 

Alas. end getting vaccinated turns employers don’t want within mile office haven’t also you’re fired don’t come in. live Texas. Texas uninsured people highest percentage people without insurance US, according Families USA.  29% adults Texas health insurance May, 2020, Texas expand Medicaid. 10 states. 

So much vaccine cost out-of-pocket? uninsured people low wage workers ""people-facing"" jobs retail customer service, even health care jobs. Certainly least folks untreated risky health conditions... untreated since can't afford treatment cases, even diagnosis know high risk condition. would higher tier group could document it, pretty tough can't afford doctor. 

How many people able afford vaccine, would affect entire population states providing effective protection?

It really matter many vials vaccine state gets can't afford it, options help state part state. know bet lot people feeling guilty killing family members covid afraid talk it. might one things folks keep quiet comes later documentary something. one harder frustrating things white doc. Changes black skin different textbooks (when trained) white skin. I've ask POC colleagues see patients help. finally books different skin tones now.  American people domesticated. Also can't afford miss day work we'll thrown overpriced rented houses lose subpar employer-provided health insurance. normal literal sense, i.e. 50% Americans gut. course, quite unhealthy one. hired! I’m fine now. careful things. 

It’s “drug-seeking”, never trust access pain (especially you’re female), shove garbage face tell get it.

I’ve never problem, heard complaints friends/neighbors doctors say can’t understand people. there's nothing Chicago. Sigh. Guess UK strain got lot websites lot clicks they’re keen continuing that. Yeah, I'm wondering if, turns vaccine provide immunity, long it'd take manufacture catch before.

Like, let's say we've got 10+ million vaccinated time found new variant resisted vaccine. terms rollout new needles get people vaccinated second time, would fair say we'd technically back 2 months prior? Yes don’t need vaccinate 330 million get back normal life. know folks saying unlikely

Those “some folks” include many experts. They’re saying paper it’s implausible vaccine efficacy reduced much, they’re still experiments make sure. viable option would ""altering"" existing vaccine be? far back would put progress, considering we'd back Day 1 manufacturing vaccine? else currently considering?

Very viable. mRNA vaccines would tweaked bit fix issue. would big setback, would start manufacturing distribution, light end tunnel still there. current vaccine may provide immunity, could assume vaccinated thus far would still heightened ability fight variant? we're still better progress we've done far?

From I’ve seen read experts say, yes, even vaccine efficacy reduced strains, likely would still substantial degree protection. wanted confirm, ""6 weeks"" it'll take alter means it'd ready rollout immediately after, right? take better part another year test safety efficacy?

Yes, imagine govts wouldn’t make Pfizer Moderna completely redo trials like new flu vaccines aren’t made to. can't openly share medical information public see. still orivate information area not. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Though post gone. see objection virus control alot.

This belief example education needed.

Lockdowns result virus getting control first-line measures failed followed/enforced.

Comprehensive, quality, timely testing tracing appropriate quarantine standard. US failed miserably coronavirus. 

Which ironic, since lead world managing host infectious diseases, drug-resistant tuberculosis, exact expert, proven methodologies. Methodologies developed. 

This gold standard methodology needs taught, learned, memorized, practiced. last epidemic/pandemic face. Yes Sorry getting lot questions. people get vaccinated mean virus becomes less likely mutate rapidly been? Czech, Czeh. want reminders 2020 never ending parade shit. They're already printing billions every night keep stonks pumped up. Fiscal responsibility thrown window since 4 months pandemic started China. No, wouldn't. would easy alter existing vaccine would work mutations well. would start scratch since mutation virus. 

I think matter whether existing vaccine react spike protein new mutations order create immune response. That's testing for. Literally drugs market? think scientist lab create new thing ready given people? widespread misconception drug development majority work research related. That's incorrect: work safety efficiacy testing. Anything coming lab first little use determine whether safe efficient. want devalue work research scientist, many friends research scientists, like 80% R&amp;D budget actually gets spend part, conducting clinical trials. yes, maybe give public research institutions 10 times budget able actually develop drugs. happens figured without private investment. people (although seems like very, few) apparently allergic reactions vaccine, might good idea stick around least 15 minutes see one rare unlucky people bad reaction it. 84.5 million Americans going travelling family friends holidays... I’m not. selfless people. vast majority hospitals aren’t unionized. actually targeted written small crap fire hear want it. 

We slaughtered years... public seeing small scale. Please note lack heroes BS people tried make us feel appreciated. Meanwhile struggling PPE DAILY changes standards. CDC joke America still struggling.

Reinfection news news enw strains officially exhausted me. I've lost ability care. I'm still empathetic. I'm still wearing masks going grocery store. just... Feel like going last forever, can't reactive forever. Yeah, guess aren’t breathing anymore, won’t much cough anymore lol

Opioids respiratory depressants. doctor ever going prescribe respiratory depressant respiratory illness.  No, still crappy. 10× cheaper Moderna, much needed vaccine world's population. patient Oxford trial hospitalised, one hospitalised severe covid Pfizer trial. Skipping meals, headache, fatigue, confusion?

I hereby diagnose every college student COVID  avoided 10 day strike, another group went strike. strain really starting show. issues study. 

First all, 23 people, people severe SARS, mild cases. 

Secondly, found part immune response. necessarily mean full protection. 

Third, found people never exposed either SARS COVID-19 immune response COVID-19 already. data seems bit strange, telling something different claim is. guess people exposed animal coronaviruses something explain seems little wacky. 330 million go! Okay, *would* technically back Day 1 innoculating masses?

Would vaccine we've going far good all? Like, matter whether provides immunity, also give subjects kind boost it? Vashon know vaccine peers got? much money governments around world spent trying mitigate spread virus halg assed measures? much better would outcomes societies accepted necessary restrictions much earlier on? Instead limped never-ending nightmare measures never chance slowing let alone stopping spread virus. approaching year in, although appears viable vaccine way, still long long way end this. look damage done terms lives lost, economies damaged, trust institutions eroded. 
Governments societies general need learn this. pandemic disease mortality rate roughly 1%. lucky 2 3%. think many societies would survived it. lessons people want watch learn. need better next time. 
Less selfish. self sacrifice. loving helping neighbours ,even neighbours around globe. I’m confused. What’s point? believe 12,000 different mutations virus. We’ve literally finding since March. first.

The virus would mutate significantly vaccines rendered ineffective. New variant=/= new vaccine, effective majority possible variants. remember billionaires work hard easily recover billions. sure anyone worried taxing back several trillion dollars soaked since beginning pandemic. 

That quote Pence's speech made Democrats look cooler actually are. doubt heat would make much difference since heated briefly 15C higher room temp - long enough matter. effective would replace furnace filter MERV13 filter might capture 70% droplet nuclei goes it. Another thing (outside opening windows) use HEPA filter. unlikely find HEPA filter compatible furnace blower motor get floor mounted HEPA filter. good one two around house... way someone gets Covid household put plastic sheets wall one HEPA side one side. sad. Many people trying keep holidays “normal” 119,000 Americans normal happy. Even worse die Christmas Day—that ruins family’s holiday years.

I hope people stay home New Year’s Day. :-(  need much last year bad worth discussing. essentially gone back peak year. tremendous effects. Especially since captures one mode transportation many people normally fly still traveling car instead. news.

everything news want sweet sweet ads-money actually pretty damn good. We’re week pace.  Girlfriends mom went hospital oxygen level 90, said double pneumonia gonna keep 5 days. feels ok, fatigued coughing. She’s 60 good health. 

Will ok? eat fist full Flintstones vitamins every morning fuck people keep saying doses increase exponential rate. didn’t buy many doses Pfizer. enough 1/3 population end JUNE. ordered 100 million given us JUNE. biggest hope getting moderna vaccines. It’s going speed month slow expect also understand suddenly reported

because fear-mongering fantastic business plan clickbait-journalism Oh oops didn’t know banned thought general term people exaggerate elongate ending pandemic Clearly Antarctica lockdown hard enough closed borders late ones mental health others physical health. It’s simple. ways deal mental health difficulties time- zoom family, see virtual therapist, go walk, call friends, etc. it’s like zero options people. many people using “mental health” way disregard others physical health / survival. It’s cop out. Everyone bad right now- mental health good rn that’s probably bad sign tbh. Nobody really knows that’s metric aiming for.  metrics drive restrictions case prevalence hospitalizations. subside, places begin loosening restrictions. knows number vaccinations require.  doesn’t really matter, need get vaccinations hell lot quicker drive numbers down. US needs 800K per day hit *dose one* (of two) given 70% adults end July. even ambitious schedule makes 70% x2 dose goal unattainable one calendar year. 

(Hopefully time single-dose option, ability manufacture vaccine rate.)

New information virus? New developments vaccine? people already know ICU filling prior post? there’s novel information presented , yes, articles like serve purpose fearmonger. seasonal. Winter savage vs. summer. 

It change completely quickly flu. Nothing does. fucking earned title. intentionally misled public started massive addiction crisis killed half million people. Plus vaccine funded large part governments (Pfizer Germany Moderna US). Yea I’d probably wait year moderna Pfizer choose getting CoronaVac cannot understand read think fda supports it. single dose data people fail get 2nd dose waiting get back line two doses.

No one recommends single dose, period. Hold up, guy charge nursing home said Belgian radio sinterklaas wear mask elderly people respected distance.
I remember telling dad much bullshit even allow that.

He never wore mask. never liked crowds, think ever like crowds.

That's say house party, yo. 

Time go play hand drums park. Brilliant day. Well get positive test, chances dying short 3%. hospitalized, number goes up. Social distancing lamb's blood door heard folks. Sounds like grim reaper came visit. agree completely. wish use terms like ""safe distance"" referring indoor spaces. Nobody gets pony way. People consume public services want lower taxes people consume lot public services want generous services. pre-pandemic policy permanent high deficits gave voters pony — low enough taxes cuts services, even libertarians complained taxes high progressives complained weren’t enough services.

Service cuts felt acutely local/state level right little federal help way, I’m sure we’re going federal level pandemic ends. seems politically impossible either raise taxes significantly cut things like Medicaid, Medicare, food stamps, defense.

I’m sorry— mistakes made unprecedented time cannot fairly compared whatever heck happened Florida Desantis. coordinated willful obfuscation reality killed people. People really underestimate mean-reversion. Spanish flu much deadlier, people went straight back old ways soon coast clear. don’t expect anything different time.

As (relatively) young middleclass person, problem personal taxes going contribute budget surplus.

Chipotle delivers, pretty cheaply. We've gotten delivered several times. sit office higher nurses (acute shock nurse manager, nurse educators, etc...) truth. Also, many people think healthcare workers experts science reason, ICU nurse doesnt want get vaccinated must something wrong vaccine. Truth is- truly nutty nurses there. One told wont take vaccine thinks vaccine tampered distribution. “Coward” isn’t insult? mean complement? every bit dense sound? actually test investor guidance? Staggering healthcare workers shots isn’t hard. Gimme break. talking couple days groups. Nah, call bullshit. community-oriented, non-selfish country follows science masks respectfully? Fake news. Next. New York Times fucking joke. touch liberals affected went 60% getting Vaccine 90%....

So far did, according mid-page, daily death top 16th 3614, since reached number, called top.

Max. death usually occurs 18-21 days infection, perfect date Thanksgiving. look daily infection rate, get slightly steeper Thanksgiving, chart: Total Coronavirus Cases.

Did numbers go hugely up? No, people tried infect lowest hanging fruit already infected. family gatherings certainly help fight virus let's get back topic 3 weeks, hitting 3800-4000 record death mid-January, easy predict.... would necessarily say mask mandates ""useless"".

At least, masks decrease transmission places mandated. Instead high transmission place, transmission mostly limited private settings. Fight one front instead two front war. 38% positivity rate? rookie numbers. Poland days 40+% even 50+% positivity rate. Yeah, Poland great job managing pandemic. **D'oh** So, since really understand (at least admit that, I'm learning go), mean respect, COVID flu-like? know get multiple strains influena together one other, thing?

Religion - “Believing can’t contract COVID follow Covid safety guidelines.” likelihood still zero. Depends consider ok guidelines are. aside that, feel like airports less concerning people arrive.

I’m almost sure you’re trolling.   Co-worker said “I go mall wonder around window shopping I’m sure gifts buy”. Yup, sounds worth exposure sure. /s everyone get vaccine. Newborns, people allergies components, immunocompromised. That’s herd immunity thing. need enough (usually ~85% +) inoculation prevent virus spreading killing vulnerable populations. personal responsibility great theory, practice, means others die fault own.

Take will. 

 one seems concerned enough follow within media government. said twice true. tell do. literally vaccinating people increasingly exponential rate. friday 550k people vaccinated already 1 mil. easily one fastest paces world. Thanks.  again, that's lockdowns, shutdowns, protections.

Too many people realize bad (or worse) could countries hit pause button. Hope Astra strong data show US vaccine trial. Heard data final Jan possibly emergency approval Feb. gets approved J&amp;J would greatly quicken return normalcy. floating virus particles would lose heavy water jackets float longer

Could reason respiratory infections general tend peak winter? Hello, contact someone tested positive 2 weeks ago also tested positive past Monday. Given quarantined 2+ weeks since exposure still quarantined another 10 days would safe assume since close exposure? Possible, yes. Likely, no. Remindme! 8 days see that. partner moved together couple months lockdowns hit, together short time. definitely exposed lot flaws relationship, also lot opportunities work them, grow together healthily.

It definitely rough first months, entirely me, thankful patience, therapist willing call shit make examine going mind. it’s lot better, we’re managing lockdown life comfortably. yet spreading hood, barrio too, places Republicans generally live.  Also, plenty people 65-75 range still working. Even teachers. telling everyone certain age stay home really absurd. Okay jeez chill. deep lol No, someone breaks rules like that, especially something serious contagious virus, punished accordingly. I'm sick tired white kids shocked, *shocked, tell you,* break rules *don't* get away it. I'm it. found evidence higher percentage Neanderthal DNA link severe cases. DNA found people African ancestry.

My racism detector went comment. Amazing conclusion, low rate infection area chances spreading virus via communal socialization low high existent rate infection increases.

Well seem grasp airborne contagion works.. people refuse believe overwhelmed hospitals actually overwhelmed burden keeps growing snd growing. yes best thing stop putting 120%.

The sooner people see bodies streets instead freezer trucks sooner they’ll take things seriously. Pfizer vaccine already distributed sitting hospital freezers even fully approved. wouldn’t disagree wife plain stupid selfish still taking flight lying COVID first place. line thinking thought symptoms mild enough travel get away lying it. Movie theaters probably not, airlines good business case it. Lol. fucking automod means everything implied. leaves many gaps misunderstanding. fact possible

Yeah def is. USA capabilities vaccinate whole country month. supply that. distribution far solid People get joke around huh? Someone asked similar question below. yup. US trials going point towards 2nd half January. there's always weeks (even emergency approval) shipped. Two weeks long time absolutely good reason delay. Even people get it. city 3.6m scheduled get 20k doses first batch. go nursing homes. total failure. usual, government's policy 'Germans last'. Since daughter's diagnosis seems gray area, I'd play safe quarantine. ven diagram people would argue sound logic people voted trump perfect circle always double take comparison think, ""Canada ~ population California.""

Use brain Imagine leadership neither problem solution take harder pill realizing society broken. sorts measures necessary health care system fragmented profit-driven, even hospitals operated non profits. 

Each locality, public health emergency, needs able come together assess totality resources available, then, essentially, assign care. example, one hospital ICUs necessary staff becomes “the” Covid hospital. stop care devote that. concentrating sick people one place, people needing types care, including ICU emergency treatment, go elsewhere. prevents people hospitalized anything Covid-19 hospital overwhelmed Covid-19, lowers hospital transmission. 

It requires political will, cooperation, government money rally people together: promise health care organizations/providers left hanging bills come due haven’t able earn much money typical types care depend on. 

There many ways we, society, could much better. Capitalist health care, piss-poor planning, politicians afraid backlash— voters care communities, lacking foresight degradation care communities land them— seeing much unnecessary death. Yes, public cooperating daily choices. leaders also leading. 

I tell you, serious car accident tomorrow, needed critical care locally hospital 30% full covid-19 70% full non-critical care/elective patients, air transported elsewhere, would incredibly pissed.

Can’t wait see much sub triggered maintain spread speed slow enough vaccine near population (by using masks maintaning social distance) , stop it. unknown whether vaccinated person still spread virus.

The time masks sufficient amount population vaccinated, simply vaccinated. Yeah, let's show rich famous getting vaccine first. Surly good horrible pr move. if... wave wave novel viruses? 

What colonize new planet atmosphere sufficient wear oxygen masks permanently. significant mutations 99% time. spread, significant mutations, mutation combinations, possibility functional change. Well stupid terrible person. morally responsible go party unless vaccinated people even still great it. fantastic news. Pfizer Moderna lot publicity, rightfully so, cheaper, less famous vaccines, ones actually give poorer countries chance mass vaccinations without waiting years rich countries buy currently approved vaccines. that's kind weird way say develop antibodies fair, got fair share vaccine deniers, lol. yeah, alarming number people equate start lockdowns West start pandemic. laughed _Songbird_ Covid-23 variant Yup, that's do. clap front line workers refuse part help alleviate load. cheers 9/11 first responders let fight cancer themselves. salute troops give shit them. American way. I’ve picked apples orchard… Except you, Fauci! cool! sure it'll go normal flu tendencies people actually take vaccine 70%... mean going deal virus like flu year till end times probably. add normal flu vaccine like seasonal ones. Yah he’s big time con, snake oil salesman etc, surprise all. Thank detailed information. regards employer notified local health department. source that? know America one kind, Canadian rate 3.2%. There’s way Americans *that* unhealthy considering populace similar. close end line. friends family vaccinated long myself. going party ain’t locking home another year. get worse worse Christmas new year. Still 50% pretty much good news, 70 80% way recomended order stop all. Every one people travelling life-or-death emergency idiot IMHO. could pay enough get plane right now.

Interesting raised Christian spent fair bit time church reading Bible. takeaway Jesus focused inordinate amount attention toward protecting sick vulnerable society.  feel churches opening spreading covid directly contradict Bible. 

That said, bear mind pastor (in protestant churches) works congregation represented church's board directors. Even personally believe church open could forced board final say. know thats case church area COVID ignored minimized end with. Força Imagine someone led people think otherwise think it’s (like another comment said) “lockdown” protected idiots, lightened up, became free all. Rather “flattening curve”, medium steady infection rate - dropped infection rate ton we’re seeing huge spike. 

The US could never extreme strict lockdown like countries, thing going burn little bit. CA’s lockdowns stopped way long, we’re seeing explode.

(“A ton” relative ofc. know nothing opinion) correct. virus spreads fast dies couple generations significant mutations. happen novel virus fragile, ie mutations kill quickly. probably never hear burns out.

This mean infecting large numbers people early robust virus good idea. damage even without mutations robust virus costly. death rate 1%, that's lot death spread high. 

That's 1% death rate viral infection bad, moderately common cancer good. 

It's multiplication factor contagion. incidence cancer US 0.4%, 1% death rate, 14.6K people would die (It actually higher death rate.) Whereas, annual flu 11% incidence, 1% death rate 363K people would die (It lower death rate).

You want viral death rates 0.05. Living alone, usually put Christmas decorations enjoy decorations others. year, stuck home time, bought small Christmas tree put up.

My wife essential worker, journalist, reports COVID numbers daily. tested found critically low vitamin D, reason meds.

I phoned sheriff report packed restaurant, seemed indifferent. mall full. Stores lines. Refrigerated trucks parked outside hospitals emergency morgues.

It makes furious, there's nothing do. I’m really proud you. do, too, even ironically. IMO even absorption multi-vitamins fortified foods natural foods, still much better nothing all. “lol” seems unnecessary. could also political sense justifies ongoing lockdown drives compliance. We’ve known variant since September it’s becoming big deal? happens, percentage, cancellation. say someone paid back college loans 3.5 times original amount borrowed--and forced, part, salary deduction. Lots people lie. Could sex toy, could drug-filled balloon.....

Glad ok! I’ll wait see one least side effects. I’m serial entrepreneur, spent last years fintech, judgement obviously least point :) Shhhh don’t use phrase “new normal crew.” Apparently it’s bannable offense, got warned yesterday.

Pretty fucking stupid harmless phrase like grounds ban, fearmongerers screech mutations supposedly whole new pandemic terrified allowed spread misinformation like every single day. bacteria conversion K absorbable form K2? sauerkraut kimchi right ones? Like drug laws, abortion, moral code? uses word ‘should’ science. grocery workers stop getting spreading coworkers guys working home, need leave grocery shop, shop bit safer along everyone else? Yes. sit epxlain experts saying? many reasons magic bullet. Many reasons.

You'll wear mask tell necessary.

Do think real world works like switch? think people actually get mask mandates?

Grow f* up. affect directly, future, I’ll say feel CDC says it’s “within 6 feet least 15 minutes 24 hour period” considered close contact. 1-3 minutes, wouldn’t worry all. u m4d Br0? One million people took precautions avoid contracting COVID day came could inject directly themselves. know, worked university lab years pre-med sucked even back trying get NIH grants. Honestly, work insulin receptors always talked applications future - talking pharm industry taking findings making therapies it, us. Two reasons: 

1. Delayed metric. [The peak new cases happened exactly 4 weeks starting see peak hospitalizations deaths, peak. see dropping next 2 weeks (assuming holiday co-operation)
2. Alberta. discussed much small towns Eastern BC primary hospital sites Alberta. example Fernie small medical unit, primary hospital Foothills Hospital Calgary. However, Alberta acted late measures. Alberta Health Service bucking pressure, increasingly, BC re-routing patients back system ([specifically towards Vancouver cases low) I've taking K2 already reason. There's variants first time there's clear evidence mutation results much transmissible form, due N501Y mutation Spike protein. Latest analysis estimates 56% transmissible variants merry Christmas too. successfully fought city pass mask ordinance Oct. 22, 1,800 new cases. Nov. 1, they’d dropped 552.

Your quote may well current doctor believes demon semen alien DNA 2020. Especially considering half assed mask measures Covid-19 flu cases low. reddit find type manufactured outrage prisons vaccine priority. mean people said ""virus doesnt mutate proofreading gene"" completely wrong. virus mutate even proofreading mechanisms.

That's world works. apparently people care. hang putting bandaids problems without addressing root cause. hang it, doesn’t mean can’t express myself. Unless course that’s want happen. Either way, I’ll take advice . took multiple deep breaths, little calmer 3 hours ago. Thanks! Thanks lot Baby Jesus!  UK reporting 60% cases London new variant. variant similar spread country, need much testing find it. Yeah, needs education. people resist twisted biased media, media companies look mirror make changes. Federal legalization wouldn’t force states legalize. Thanks this.

Merry Christmas Eve everyone :) decent job explaining. Economist good work. 

Take care &amp; stay safe. Good luck you, hope everything works out. ""see"" hospitals full now? based reporting. People can't even go hospital look around right and, even non-pandemic, one can't wander ICUs assess capacity. case state. clinic i'm working 3 retired nurses 12 nursing students working. know easier said done really choice. grow stagnate.

Or one could cut overgrown military budget invade countries. Unless you’re old and/or high-risk, you’re likely going die. That’s I’ve always heard, too, study reported opposite effect. Hopefully effectively safely necessary. glad vaccine companies testing make sure effectiveness same. Hopefully prove equally effective strains encountered trials!

I'm sure lots mutations; sequence .3% positive results miss lot. Gu’s best estimates put total number infected way higher confirmed he’s consistently right now-casting data. take deaths divide estimated infections get 0.4%.

Why would take somebody's best guess total number infected rather simply look serological data? particularly care one guy ""thinks"" total number people infected. even Ioannidis low 0.4% countries 500 deaths per million data stems first CDC’s estimated IFR pandemic planning scenario age stratified IFRs put much lower 1.15 anything 1%.

The CDC updated pandemic planning scenarios since September, third wave proven larger deaths shorter period time. much likely scenario head counting cases hard older countries outbreaks noise makes p values hard hell narrow. 

You're much likely get accurate count high income country poor country simply resources. Cameroon Somalia, you’ve got handful old people died wi virus million kids. Makes pretty damn easy get consistent IFR estimate.

Which main consideration along young/healthy people behave general. alas, we're selfish country. Yes ventilation systems, indoors, stronger (UVC) takes (I think). Covid mostly spread droplets air indoors. effect sun/summer season spend time gather outdoors instead indoors, possibly D-vitamin, UV killing virus mid air door handles.

Simply they're effective. Sorry I've made confusing sick March. Still hard breathe, pretty sure rest life point get better next year.

If someone 'knowlingly' goes work covid symptoms middle pandemic can't believe would feel remorse. risks big secret. Wtf taking long? rate 1 million vaccinated every 10 days, 11% US population vaccinated 1 year. shit's never gonna over. Yes stopping getting 100% reducing likelihood getting it. masks measure place stop spreading much. like condoms, masks measure 100%. That's false lol. Also add people already contracted Covid (probably easier new UK strain... Sigh) easily 70% herd immunity mark. envious... Yeah UK seemed turbo approve Pfizer one slow walking Mods sub reddit, well social networks, really careful kind headlines. Antivaxxing pandemic own, fuels it. can’t get travelers? lying guy wife get plane died. need require tests. that. It’s understandable weary rushed, new tech vaccine. I’m still getting though. talking points wall aggressive reason. sub it’s hard left leaning anything right bad go prison people it. didn’t seem like people commenting you. I’m making general observation. (Victorian) lockdown different state cases rising (NSW)? Pog know, soon arguments. weeks, see people start complain wait shots!

The mRNA-based vaccines fantastic. beginning, may become answer treating cancer well! Man Pfizer getting *riiiiiiich* pandemic holy shit. taking amount total cases spreading time.

I agree. comment I'm responding claims ""no reason"" - ""end game""....  Clearly ""not overwhelming ER"" short term goal, sure. 

But say ""that whole thing"" arguing good faith. expect people want know reactions vaccine. reinforces people previously history anaphylaxis ones likely rare reaction. long get second dose? immune (at least much vaccine capable of) I'd bet driving far alone much riskier statistically lol ""Dummy goes work Icky.

Fauci saying isn’t certain yet, good scientists rather jumping conclusions. That's somewhat comforting. say ""more"" I'm referring spending overall. We've spent 10-25% GDP various relief programs. PPP loans effectively wage subsidy 80%+ levels people ""see"" directly; mean supporting wages. study impact administering vaccine someone currently virus? example could vaccine used treatment, conversely, would administering vaccine make virus present, resistant? We’ve got 11 million vaccines, they’ve distributed 1 million. 

By first week January we’ll 20 million vaccines sitting freezers.

If produce demand staggering number, something really wrong logistically. Oh got nothing virus.. South Welsh women mad.

They lure sultry siren-esque voices devilish good looks beat death shoes because, transpires, they're completely hatstand mental.

(Source, I'm region) adds 2% population.
180,000 people vaccinated.  submit sources support claims. pretty much definition, US way becoming dystopia.

You’re used it, probably think normal. outsiders, it’s not. almost impossible get appointment testing, drive-thru clinics easily available existed Gulf Coast shut holidays, still everyone wandering around without masks ordek nosing best, grocery stores Big Box retailers absolutely packed. friend manages hotel completely full including pool party event. seem getting every conspiracy theorist anti-vax idiot know come since rules places much Social pressure except individual business demenza mask. interstate nuts go get gas. 

No idea snowbirds want come die, hospitals capacity last week Urgent Care clinics telling people stay home monitor symptoms 911 emergency rooms completely overloaded, they've treat people ambulances.


Please encourage people come regardless governor says - numbers were/are never accurate visitors even worse risk conspiracy types globally domestically gathering behave responsibly. reference country chosen. majority favor guidance Feds. smaller government politicos shot hundreds thousands constituents left millions life long handicapped.  country. clearly one party one president. missed concerns me. guess word mouth. Health care workers talking spouses friends.

That's still reporting. point made down-voted general public can't wander ICU personally verify capacity. public's knowledge go inside hospital completely dependent upon accuracy reports it--whether reports coming employees agencies.

It's entirely possible hospital completely overrun hear anything even living blocks away. live blocks local hospital sealed half house opened health care workers via AirBnB heard hotels charging traveling nurses ""anything want charge you, there's housing anywhere."" six ICU nurses respiratory therapists house know many people dying daily there. Aside tents parking lots vehicle traffic in/out, place looks relatively serene outside. Yeah well... serious govt wouldnt lie that, since would Stilo show data. yikes. supposed wear masks day people dont ""cheat"" definitely arent communal meals.. somewhat spread Feel bad little ones wont good Christmas :\\

I really wish billionaire right now, somehow losing soul process lot clinics things like surgical procedures, radiation chemo treatments typically scheduled weekdays, hospital comparatively empty weekends. 

It's plausible first days vaccination regular covid areas like ICU ER, weekend came there's reason bringing people, normally hospital, get shot. paid debt, signed it, paid off. 45k. hope forgive debt others ass worked hard pay off. People need take responsibility actions work pay debt instead thinking uncle Sam gonna bail em make new strain contagious? last longer objects? work level 2 trauma ER RN.

This doesn’t happen much right now. Hallways definitely fill ICUs/EDs fill brim, sure, people coding left right. normal.  didn’t isn’t.

Im pretty sure Healthcare workers able sign moment. 2 friends, one OBGYN Trauma surgeon able schedule vaccinations ahead time.  We’re behind pace. taking hospitals long inject people? open pool trouble getting shots arms Please remember HIV/Aids incredibly common among poor population South Africa. That's likely going reason seems severe ""first world"". talking about? testing sites make keep windows up, full protective gear, hand kit via long pole come within six feet, drop kit take swab garbage chute. absolute BS conclusion made. classic error correlation equals causation.

Typical example basic regression ice cream sales drowning positively correlated. idiot would claim Ice cream sales CAUSE people drown. look covariates (i.e. time/summer temperature). shows third factor drives both. might seeing cases N501Y strain popping Singapore soon.

Correct! none affected Pfizer. Pre-ordering investing. constantly moanong borders closed yea, sort open idiots came.

Must really shitty wet island. Yeah, he's buttergut. Lmao zombies? I'm gonna wait see happens. sounds good, theory. covid 19 January. Doctors didn’t know was. Testing wasn’t thing yet. every test imaginable, February August. August, pulmonologist bronchial wash, finally felt better. 
I exposed late October, I’m suffering exact symptoms, covid confirmed, plus antibody test positive. 

There’s treatment this. I’ve diagnosed Long Covid Syndrome, treat symptoms. false positive initially, reason get tested again, since I’m boss. 
By time tired sick tired, late resistavir. (Sp)

I seen infectious disease doctors pulmonologists. medicine make go away. 
My PC doesn’t treat covid. 

So yeah, that’s fine. don’t get vaccine, can’t get treatment isn’t available anyway. back day could buy physical paper 50 cents really wanted read story -- online papers want subscribe monthly read paper -- often reporting garbage repost AP article -- I'm paying that. subscribe NYTimes, I'm going subscribe every single state's podunk local paper. 

I hope helps understanding world. one million, feel damn happy this!!! That's waste 5 million doses.

People are, average, stupid. account that. beat stupidity something important. Train them, test them, train listening first time. 

Just handing 9.5 million sensitive doses bunch truckers roped something they've never done disaster waiting happen. Operation warp speed research development. Good job reading it. Really? Even right now? Maybe I'm underestimating careless Europe became good initial testing-based COVID containment. someone rephrase makes sense? sister-in-law got hospital Monday Illinois. rolling much faster wife's hospital KC. migrated commentary ""it's easy"" ""it's hard"" finite amount money?

Share everyone easy obtain. Give us links. Congress needs quorum pass legislation- 51 Senate, 218 House. numbers relatively low, means immunizing members government important function government.

So question ""Who like better, Mitch McConnell Tom Hanks?"". question ""Who important functioning United States?"" Mitch wins one. YES! Haha, sounds like relationship! He’s trolliest troll trolls daily (and yet fucking fall every time trust lmfao) I’m sly, “biding time” troll falls every time simply save trolling least expects it. It’s much fun, haha!

Also lots groping occupied unable defend, course. ;D might. scientists known mysteriously fall windows places.. I’m sure ethics comittee thrilled need two doses? one dose 50%? many republican covid False positives happen time, however. 1. Lots people unemployed
2. employees needed crucial service

Man, kind solution  comments see Facebook vaccine people refuse get it. wonder something Facebook attracts anti-vaxxers. holy shit know state level we’re running problem coordinating vaccines smaller healthcare offices can’t store larger providers won’t vaccinate external healthcare workers they’ve seen staff. 
My office waiting list county’s health department told someone able vaccinate us since don’t means store vaccines appropriately. 🤞it’ll turn soonish Yeah exactly. People chain acting like 1 million week impressive pace. That’d mean 330 weeks vaccinate everyone. like 250 weeks reach herd immunity. Great ok 2025 long doesn’t mutate much!!! need pick fucking pace. think tons people want wear masks even COVID gone that's great thing. clear wake day day hygiene practices great. yeah, need # new cases flat line move onto things. think parents attitude support plays roll situation though. help work feelings, find solutions adaptations,and give safe place express sadness anxieties. immediate response critically important trauma. know work, delayed start vaccinations due large snow storm got last Wednesday Friday need focus staff patient care current staff shortages.

I’m getting Pfizer vaccine Sunday. aren’t giving Friday due holiday. Can’t wait. Good thing don’t crown US crazy scientist Siberia? Yeah know one. April. Nothing enforced America aside taxes prison. Yet develop world wide web. currently mate

You're points moot proven wrong exactly, I'm still scared politicians slow adapt point. can't see flipping switch from, ""this deadly everyone"" ""if old immunocompromised, gonna die."" Unfortunately egos probs prevent pulling curtain back white lie may cost us. Also, another issue almost altruistic medical community. fully see wacko vaccine sect refusing take vaccine dying everyone else punished form capacity limits all. effective vaccine preventing severe illness, anyone get it, allowed go back like true normal. would fair everyone who's nutjob unfortunately we'll probs pay price ignorance idiots refuse take vaccine. Moderna vaccine literally approved Friday arrived clinics Monday. Cut us slack. Many people understand infected recovered gives roughly protection vaccine, least short term. matter many studies experts say it, shrug like nothing. Yes generalization. idea. Super spreaders blame virulence virus. comment remains. relatively small number real infections people sick something else wrong reinfected mutually exclusive things.

Yes, know reinfection *possible*. Given scale we're seeing real life, still unlikely sub full reinfected individuals here, too. see projected pace administer? curious Well, N95 government standard, model number.

3M, Moldex, Optrel make N95 masks.

(Actually, many companies: FYI antibodies fading mean get again. Antibodies indication immunity generally fade. Immunity likely lasts years based people caught again, right obviously based projections. closed high schools universities.

As university student, I've completely distant teaching since March continue summer. based directives Public Health Agency.

And people started working home, socially distancing, washing hands travelling much less repeatedly told so. I've sore 3 days think Nate Silver tried make sort point got lot hate it. think we'll perfect vaccination priority make everyone happy. thing want virus deniers anti masker people refused lock get last. mandatory.

I go first gen devices, I'm getting first gen vaccine. tell per student spending US compared countries? What's plan test positive third day land? understand vaccine total protection, right? become invulnerable vaccination. get sick, vastly likely survive. less likely get infected. absolute protection - cannot act completely immune, works. beg pardon necessary able taste spaghetti worship Flying Spaghetti Monster. meeting in? Fauci said that? way we’ll masks 2022. think people underestimating vaccines.  cause reported place Oregon, doesn’t mean happening places I'll publicly eat hat takes 10 years vaccinate americans Moderna shelf life months freezer. It’s 30 days refrigerator. Pfizer’s shelf life couple days refrigerator. Yes, figures went lockdown ended. Dude piece shit. there's earthquake fire lose people stuff, believe owed compensation? Worse, think human beings leveraged affects get kind compensation? Go crawling back hole imp. quite clearly know nothing vaccines.

Explain? 6 times likely get sick AZ vaccine opposed Pfizer one, 3 times less without vaccine all. (AP) — Pfizer said Wednesday supply U.S. government additional 100 million doses COVID-19 vaccine new agreement pharmaceutical giant Trump German partner BioNTech said bring total current commitment 200 million doses U.S. enough vaccinate 100 million people two-shot regimen. government also option purchase additional 400 million doses.

I read one person requiring two doses, got 50M people first purchase 50M people second purchase. Could be, necessarily Let's keep going - double avoiding groups, distancing, masking washing! 2020, overwhelmed hospitals stop caring whether triaging least likely survive ""fat shaming"". Hopefully push get $2,000 goes through. 10 month dry spell, second get vaccine, suck fuck every man see 😌 Sure, continuously proven last year, wrong. people god-awful risk assessment. 

They think they're taking risk X, they'll actually taking risk 10X.  outlying counties populated folks agree majority Californians. Primarily one “side” protesting mask-wearing prudent measures spreading lies virus beginning. lockdowns useless cases go go end? even know that, commenting here? 
For example Balkan Baltic countries. AHAHAHHAA hearing people say work work many times last days... nothing confirmed... smh... all. many people talking aprox.?

I'll take hope get. approved children preggers, cuts number need treat 200 million. pfizer vaccine take long administer recognize practical limits stockpiling materials personnel. point you’ll throwing expired materials regularly you’ll personnel sits around nothing normal times.

I agree 100% healthcare doesn’t need run maximum efficiency like nothing within reason gonna fully prepared full blown pandemic. limits always going reached situation like this. Probably still recommended people got covid also get vaccinated since guaranteed amount protection rather varying amount antibodies someone might made based severe infection He's 41 years old require officially, tons exemptions practice aren’t required. Skipping queue nah? Feds rely Corporations like COVID mandades fair, live Santa Clara County, CA strictest stay-home orders country. walk neighborhood never forbidden. 

It's intentionally rather 15 seconds sun get walking office parking lot desk. Yep fellow Tennessean here. one taking seriously whatsoever. probably going take vaccine either. What’re referring to? bit behind US mRNA vaccines, isn’t one still one front runners? it’s strawman disingenuous? 100% result will, levels gradual. im really hoping explosion post covid horniness among general population jump start stagnant love life yahoo.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Here Europe global, European coordinator, one coordinator country broken onto smaller bits depending country size. country building transport vaccination centers past two months. seen well works, seems people put thought go transparent planning goes. Meanwhile, seen big plan US go distribution besides ""getting every state vaccines need"". So, what's deal side pond? guy? sick May? considerably less bad, maybe immune system job? Seems like we’re making pretty good progress atm healthcare workers  higher 0.2 higher 0.1 sharing shorts like baby bird kind situation? everyone shiftless neckneard troll worry, China got back least get 'jelly month' subscriptions? mother contracted COVID back June. week illness, realized needed go hospital called sister help.

My sister rushed over, thinking mother would ready go.

But mother wanted take bath first. Since weak bathe herself, needed sister help her. bath, mother wanted put best clothes, best make-up, best wig. took three hours preparation mother ready go.

Now, normally mother's vanity would piss off. time. know mother wanted look best. knew strolled ER sour-smelling house coat head wrapped hankerchief, would treated like garbage. would treated like drug-seeking, indigent nobody, instead upper middle class person Cadillac health coverage.  black, matter well speak many degrees have. another n*gger default. maybe dress real nice, someone treat like human being, least.

The hospital treat mother like human being, that's survived. sad think mothers lucky. Good you. know I’m healthcare worker feels way. ones hear ones cry online karma attention though. think it’s bit complex - history sorts developments story compromising NIMBYs fucking poor marginalized. There’s reason neighborhoods butt interstates tend lower prestige, reason federal prisons get stuck BFE hillbilly towns. Essentially idea new take housing projects, you’re going compromise nimbys you’ll end ghetto districts.

All say solution offer - free undesirable housing funded federal level prevent local crowding seems ideal, issues raised aren’t hypothetical. 

The realistic solution, think, set labor camps serve detox treatment centers, offer housing work, system designed reintroduce people society. would need far away major metros order cut drug influx protect residents dangers roughing city (assault, robbery, etc homeless folks deal every day), also keep the
homeless element cities obvious reasons.

However ethical issues enormous can’t imagine becoming anything semi-prison camp people sent vanish. mention significant expenses supply police place like that, let alone many. “Deficit hawks” would prevent funding we’d end domestic refugee cities. what’s ideal answer? unfortunate people experiencing homelessness path toward normal life, mentally ill active junkies really isn’t anything besides institutions great outdoors. giving billionaires corporations tax cut tax cut tax cut?

Every time cocksuckers get tax cut lay people use cash reward board fluff stock prices needed intrusive government, needed invasive government

Wut ‘Merica!  Millions!!! Millions... Absolutely still good vaccine keep people hospital. wouldn’t surprise first-world countries handle cost distribution others end deciding use Oxford/AZ hopes waiting little longer others ultimately let get back normal life sooner.

For member “young healthy” demographic, main concern never getting sick myself, it’s risk might pose higher-risk family members. turns vaccines prevent asymptomatic transmission others don’t, I’ll stick masks distancing wait get vaccine protect family me. I've read reason 40 hour work week overtime pay, paid holidays vacations, sick days, et cetera... due labor movements past striking. seem recall civil rights movement began boycott busing, devastating local government associated businesses Jim Crow era. lifetime, would hope see tactics successful past, utilized improve lives workers future.

Covid early on. want risk again. whatever reason get choice one, would choose?  like u guys ever leave ur house?

im trying stay home much possible im afraid catching virus bringing bck home

am irrational? great got vaccine quick, study 5 year, 10 year side effects? PERSONALLY guarantee interactions drugs? US spent 30 years letting Walmart destroy mom pop shops, 15 years watching Amazon destroy retail, oblivious act. entire country sees happened, they’re big powerful touched anyone, including federal government.

What lot people even somehow forgetting, first wave, nearly enough testing capacity adequately measure true amount cases, nowhere near place today. personally know many people told likely covid, get tested unless admitted hospital. 

So daily case numbers comparable, seeing tip iceberg terms actual cases, feeling full brunt hospitalizations deaths, especially densely populated regions state. I'm sure absolutely nothing terrible response Republicans. that. There's even theoretical reasons believe vaccines work. Taking vaccine make infectious. assume asking vaccine gives sterilizing immunity. find months.

The competition even actually started yet, act like somehow examples results competition. got choice, I'd go Phizer. Oxford vaccine still good enough, cheap enough mass produce it'll likely main vaccine used, especially vaccinating extra risk covid.

That's thing. never ends doesn’t say K1 K2. Awful oversight. Amazon used stock program ended pay employees $15/hour. absolutely called one.

People going get tested Christmas.  always buy company’s stocks become owners themselves. customer able pay, it’s short term satisfaction e.g. fast food negativity see “the second quarter 2021”? Considering race time vaccinations, perhaps would better halt plane travel general. countries reach immunity. new variant already formed majority cases London, days Christmas millions people traveling home, probably already spreading many places. needs real discussion people covid. Vaccinated people discussed getting things people can’t win vaccinated cards.

But people covid proven immunity know can’t contract back line can’t presumably party till vaccine

Then, week following holiday, test, case, death numbers spike, look like confirmation Thanksgiving causing outbreaks worsen. neither expected movements data necessarily mean anything state pandemic itself.

Also, unlike wearing mask; someone wants drive thru ... it. I'm willing risk getting someone else sick wanted burger. Good see Latin American countries start vaccinations. health care systems economies suffered terribly past months. Christmas covid surge top Thanksgiving one

This could prevented year back crowds think nothing it. taking d3 k2 supplements years... mental health.

Weird. told take deep breaths calm down? ... saw news. longer supporting party. True. see week two delay California states ICU rates. show whether CA outlier. I'm questioning part. I'm wondering Santa. image Santa understand appeal guy dressed suit?

I'm ok today. comes back video, can't 'that' morbid lol

I'm also weird one loves ""last Christmas"" read title mean vaccine Covid-19...which course correct Haha really took Trump’s logic heart. critical thinking error reasonable people’s logic fail. guidelines rules set place try limit spread virus allowing us continue day day operation. doesn’t mean following guidelines ability purpose completely protect people following them. transmission occur hopefully spreads less people hospitals hit slower. 

When go shopping groceries pass people sidewalk exposure limited. chance someone it, next you, breathing direction happens times day. travel airport enclosed space people hours. plane gates, too. people get restless careless. Yep, right. linked article 100 million additional doses first hundred million. would vaccinate 100M people, that’s Pfizer. Moderna’s vaccine, vaccine single dose full vaccination. studies look long term effects young children get COVID? 

My ultimate concern getting sick passing 14 mo old daughter deal lingering effects throughout life.  wants someone mentality? time mentality win championships. That's Westbrook wanted get traded ... What? way... still way wilderness civilization, back suburbs beyond backyard. shoulder road trees grow. data remembered reading area initially seen September outspread strains large margin 2 months. estimate rate relative spread accurate people data on. Supposedly scientists think data statistically significant enough ring alarm bells. much doubt (I checking I'm r/conspiracy) there's conspiracy.

All data information regarding B.1.1.7 variant published papers, available everyone read.

That said, UK county able genetically sequence virus samples massive scale. UK sequenced 100,00 virus samples, US sequenced 2,300.

Previous variants may emerged transmissible, know, country (apart Iceland) able genetically sequence many samples link increases infection rates specific variant mutation.

Maybe Ecuador hit hard, India fared much better. could different variants. Multiple waves might also cased new variants emerging time. know scare we're usually blind tj events. misleading headline. says doesn’t know herd immunity kick in, safe bet would 70%-90%. “But I’m going say 90%” new normal... 

This new normal. incredibly abnormal last months worst. Check label make sure. looked Equate multivitamin gummies adults see vitamin K there. worries, mate. next time. 

Happy holidays. calculate % required herd immunity, factor behaviour (which masks, isolated). change behaviour, % required herd immunity goes way up. Oh, window shop toys cars, comes life-altering vaccine entire planet needs, supposed shuttup research?

Couldn't one vaccine rated 94% vs 69%, anything... Please read much take one OK? Six 280,000 according another article. selected sample. looks like small number still magnitudes higher frequency severe allergic reactions vaccines there. trials included ICU, non ICU patients. AFAIK, never data support DVT nomogram anticoagulation floor patients (who another indication AC).

Please careful next two days know people reddit love squash concerning news unfettered optimism base opinions common sense due amount infections worldwide giving virus ample opportunity mutation mention fact virus found different animals going escalate way continuously alter vaccine get two doses eight billion ppl that's reality.

Sorry realist refuse throw common sense window feel warm fuzzy pretend vaccines anyway going end we're eventually going numerous mutated versions virus spreading world different times possible way keep multiple vaccinations would required. wrong? 2.491 million Monday 12/23/19, although Friday 12/20 2.608 million. (1.9 million 12/25/19) TN might white Christmas. would first 45 years life. aren’t able go anywhere tomorrow anyway. great day snow sip mimosas fire. Yeah.. Seriously. 1. think major effort make people prove vaccination going certain places certain things

2. I've never heard people covid back line vaccines. There's database people covid anything anyone even know

3. People covid still recommended get vaccine immunity infection guaranteed vary based large viral load person had. vaccine way get stable standard immunization 

4. one punishing covid gonna die dude Mine moderna. According early results everyone experiences side effects, guess one lucky ones. People said ""virus doesnt mutate proofreading gene"" completely wrong.

Of course were. I’m pointing people exist made majority here.

Everyone pretending “no one ever said had.” Yes did! *fewer thanks! I’m terrible cook even worse gift-giver, kiddos home safe, 10 year old decorated every wall paper snowflakes, Christmas movies playing day. Candlelight service via YouTube tonight. :) Merry Christmas everyone! Yea, political all... ok Removed moderator. Apparently I’m one thought trashy. Everyone comments talking abott adding beds, pop hospitals bed patients, getting hotels become rooms patients... etc... problem gonna staff them? ICU patients need 1:1 care maybe 1:2, that’s stretching it. can’t find enough staff fill beds places, hospitals barely enough staff begin with. hospitals literally *took weekend off.*

3,600 doses given Friday. 182 Saturday. 36 Sunday. 5,900 Monday.

If hospitals can't assed work weekend, there's two options. 

1) medical community believes virus serious / significant issue, raises questions see ads nurses crying begging us take seriously.

2) believe virus serious, willing put extra effort deal it. Criminal charges follow.

There's third option makes sense. *plenty* vaccine hand. They're using it. lab animals ...both can’t wait sit crowded bar. mean.. pretty much Like Kelly Bundy's English English translation book Assholes literally everywhere Wearing mask super easy still don’t understand makes people mad it. we’ve since learned it, may handle differently valid reasons. OP people like touch relaity. I'm 5'1 100lbs woman. someone tell get job shipyard consturction. showed shipyard looking job, would laugh face. Consutruction? know build anything. can't lift heavy shit. 

It poor struggling expect us take anything. Even jobs dangerous can't do. Well, percentage point difference 1% severe disease means one every 10 deaths prevented serious cases. minimal difference line critical care interventions post-arrest cooling similar. 


If works would part ever widening array treatments available. interventions seem way impactful, impact treatments cumulative. 


To clear - pro-plasma something. critical care probably one contentious difficult study fields medicine. generally quite difficult move needle field, generally takes dozens iterative improvements amount difference looks impressive outsider. 


Like cardiac care probably couple dozen best practices amounted substantial improvements outcomes cardiac patients. Things isolation minor impacts (cooling example 0.8 RR - goes 10% survival 12% survival) accumulate full care plan. 


_If_ convalescent plasma gives one percentage point help quite line interventions, similar effective risk invasiveness - line interventions executed whenever reasonable. 

That's critical care research is. Fill bag tricks intensivists better manage limited resources have. one thing I've hearing lot bugs - people saying ""this family, we've decided together although there's risk, we're comfortable risk. risk take, one's business tell us otherwise."" I've heard intelligent friends say this, COVID deniers.

If bungee jumping something risk solely participant, yeah logic completely fine. like people literally forgotten risk pandemic works - family may decided they're fine risk, gathering spark exponentially growing transmission chain quickly injures kills people consent risk. Adam Silver kind whack this. bench player would actual major punishment this, massive fine.

They literally bending backwards Harden he's allstar, whack hell No, there's lmao dont want continue. see something would make sense short periods time isolated circumstances future. Im well aware compliance another matter entirely, even mandated. make great points attention span health literacy country. vaccine likely turn vicious pitbull virus little chihuahua virus enough population, length antibodies future mutations may remain issue. Frankly, variant mutated variants discovered. rate mutation important predicting long vaccine remain effective for. virus mutates quickly, able vaccinate enough people stop spread modify vaccine. 44 pretty random age include “youth” category. It’s unreasonable assume 25 year old people parents would still classify “youth” using 44. 

The common age range youth generally around 15-25. Even expanding 40, guarantee 100% certainty study would outcome. 

They came 5 less deaths Covid overdoses including age range notable Covid deaths (anyone 40 much higher risk). 25-34 age range far highest opioid deaths rate, Covid death rate still minuscule compared 44 year olds. 

The 20-40 age range makes 34% cases Canada. make 8.3% hospitalizations. make **0.3% deaths**. deaths likely accurate, infections likely way higher due people getting tested feel cold. 

The 40-49 age range makes 14.5% cases, 7.2% hospitalizations, 0.7% deaths. Including 40% age range “youth” category completely invalidates entire study. Well LA one conservative areas California, surprising Spare ackshually lame false equivalences, please.

The common cold covid. Dishonest bullshit. told told them. Everyone told told them. fault listen. I'm sorry. mean, appointed Chief Medical Advisor probably read first line comment figured virus denier. Im not. I've shit. sucks. one negative negatives sake right? person said speed right supply. Whilst supply relatively low best sorting logistics supply issue. I'm sorry ☹️🙏

Thank Companies even type emergency funds. reality America mostly consumer economy means everyone saves like madman economy crashes/shrinks LOT. factory owner offer $20,000 signing bonus $1,000,000 family members die result. Offer life insurance policy something. Till happens, enjoy labor shortages. mention hired job, typically takes 90-120 days health insurance kick (provided offered all). could end getting Covid work either dying can't afford care seek emergency care end six seven figures worth debt.

God bless America! 60k deaths year COVID better life permanent masking social distancing hard believe different areas/hospitals different situations going on? think it'll perfectly morally responsible go party elderly at-risk vaccinated seems reasonable me. Antibody surveys surge around 10 %, we’re month huge mega-surge far eclipses previous surges. almost data this. However heard studies get vaccines one another see immunity boosted, early next year. Perhaps summer good data taking two leading vaccine candidates approved vaccines. work NYC hospital (though frontline) – accurate. One major concerns hospital's leadership expressed winter surge able get help medical personnel parts country time, that's even expectation severe first wave was. actually sent personnel help states months ago NY's cases quite low, think state going able give staff next couple months.  Based read making original comment, I'd say 100 million upper bound across country, I'd wager bigger worse affected cities, immunity levels could higher 40% north 100 million 1 3, reported 5 1 march would 200 million 2 3 approx current 200k day. 

What? Confirmed cases around 19 million. 5 1 ratio would give around 110 million odd infections. lots 1-star michelin street food places asia. cheap, good fuck, eaten regular people time. Press F doubt looks like Italy wins big unless article wrong. said consider small handful cities US really think fair measure comparing countries. people still large gatherings complete willful failure national communications pandemic.

Most high risk people weeks away getting vaccine. catch thing ridiculous. Stop blaming federal government. Stop trying pretend like something blame politicians like. American problem, societal problem. probably wants conservative estimates. talking Rebekah Jones, medical professional. geographic information sciences manager. Got better ideas? would never argue scrutiny accountability, especially loans whether truly needed payrolls not.

But making determination extremely difficult expensive right. doctor, sure; nurses aides another story. number patients responsible given day extremely disproportionate compensation so. Chris Paul though. unspoken part calling healthcare workers heroes expectation selflessly sacrifice sins. eradicate flu making masks fashion icon. someone science background think it’s important report new findings think push flu shots season seriously questioned. people understood viral interference thing may start ask questions. 

I absolutely think many benefit flu shots, health care workers cautious receives study interference seems occur properly screen patients benefit flu shot vs may increased risk complications respiratory viruses. Look parts California stories happening see connection (Lancaster one, Orange County shooting). get 50% figure? Projections generally 30-40%. I'm sure meant large segments lower tier CNA nursing home staff home health care workers underpaid, like 9-12 hour. talking case data. According WorldoMeters, cases peaked 18th. said, probably slight increase cases hard discern data. Certainly expected huge surge never happened.

Deaths peak 16th, far tell still increasing. hard confirm days though due holidays. get 16th? 

Also, deaths lagging indicator. would expect peak 3 weeks Thanksgiving? Could confirmation bias? According WoM, 12/22 biggest day far. turned biggest day, would expected too? later? 

My argument based shapes curves Thanksgiving. sorry living nightmare. Bet it’s hollywood presbyterian. work say it’s definitely least 5x worse patient influx compared around thanksgiving  No, quite since summer. department defence obviously big hope, finding P2 P3 trials.

The safety really remarkable, 6 grade 1 events, grade 2 worse. Pfizer Moderna grade 2 grade 3 events. 

Inovio using DNA vaccines, really similar mRNA vaccines. instead think biggest issue trying get vaccine “best groups” first. way works outside hospital workers nursing home staff residents massive approval bureaucracy. slow way versus taking appointments giving vaccines. don’t see phases going work, except sort honor system. meant limit response fundamental lending/credit functioning modern economy. 

Right yeah makes sense. naive say banks pause loan payments. mean imply forced keep non-essential businesses open. 

But seems forced keep open. I'm canada weve done ok. except first couple months basically businesses open. numbers bad USA keep climbing restaurants bars non essential businesses huge part that.

I think seeing reckoning economy. massive trade tons businesses workers going bust saving lives getting pandemic without waiting vaccine. really think theres something gained looking society slaves debt.

I dont education really get details heres example I'm confident theres massive inneficiency baked banking system. city, housing prices roughly doubled last 5 years. city adjusted property tax rates accordingly mortgage rates independent local housing prices. house sale represents increase amount money sent bank land already existed. Nothing physically changing world amount money sent banks land constantly increasing. data released Chinese government? Please use thing ears. Already people jockeying hospital don’t even freakin’ vaccine yet. really need calm down...you made far hospital unvaccinated, wait weeks let employees high-exposure go first. So, he’s omnipotent _and_ poor communicator? Sounds like manager last job. last paragraph makes ton sense, it’s frustrating Fauci won’t acknowledge go back normal fully hit herd immunity. another title could said, “air travel drops less half last year” would accurate. Hmmm grown-ass adults need Santa? Let alone senior citizens? Funny, mention vaccine said backed CDC findings linked.

learn read. Lolololol eradicated flu, would covid-19 eradicated? It'll seasonal likely, even strains, like flu Could Yeah, eRouška thing pretty much felt apart months ago. Like said, people straight-up refuse name contacts, circumstances, going work. yes, there's tons people refuse get tested, probably continuing go work infected, quarantine means big hit right wallet. Add mounting sense frustration government's seemingly bungled handling situation overall I'm surprised still spreading like wildfire. 

Then next, vaccination likely another shitshow, past prologue. Eat greens News outlets take advantage EZ-mode clickbait getting aggravating might able find r/Ontario Fauci said weeks ago, hesitated publicly raise estimate many Americans seemed hesitant vaccines, would need accept almost universally order country achieve herd immunity.

The original assumption would take 60 70 percent immunity stop disease based early data China Italy, health experts noted.

Even Dr. Fauci right take 85 even 90 percent herd immunity completely stop coronavirus transmission, Dr. Lipsitch said, “we still defang virus sooner that.”

He added: “We don’t zero transmission order decent society. lots diseases, like flu, transmitting time, don’t shut society that. vaccinate almost people risk severe outcomes, would become milder disease.” Turkey best relationship China. I'd believe say 91% lol. could find, really. hope findings forthcoming. 55 older tier 1? whatever category older residents get vaccine?  I'm visiting dad Bulgaria now, live halfway mountain - next door literally Ski Lift slopes. days ago, snowed top mountain. literally 30 meter queue lifts, social distancing, nothing, looked like legit normal regular good ski day. WTF people. thought 50-60% so, 90%? load crap"
