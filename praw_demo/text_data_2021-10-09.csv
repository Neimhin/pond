The youngest kids need protecting most. 


You also look leading causes death kids covid mix. Maybe me, feel inspired data continue masking taking precautions. 


I'm fully vaccinated feel could, good conscience, go maskless around anyone's unvaccinated children, especially young. Thanks correction. Clearly missed detail. really outdoor large sheltered, thus ventilation poor due high density. also correct Latin spelling *breast*.

Won't think children?  Spanish flu? could possibly still going around? Surely mean other, newer strain flu? Harvard health made post fear needles. rate seems absurdly high. 25% us adults. includes mild anxiety clinical level fear. one estimate percentage clinical levels, couple sources 10%


[Harvard Health Blog April 27 thread Rome, yeah you’re right several Eastern European countries different situation.   Moderna's shown effective delta different COVID-19 antigen tests positive flu?   Yup, people die acts like this.  Reading article, pharmacy gave cards realized mistake called. Since got vaccine, might well record it.

There might malpractice case, unless kids end serious complications, there's probably going significant monetary compensation that's parents expecting. extremely important, however, pharmacy administers correct treatment correct dosage recipient - case, failed severely, since approved treatment dosage kids age.  suppose correct. worry old people give fucks anymore. understand pointless though. Death bad thing happen children Covid. thing could happen, sure.

This may enlightening. article answers question second paragraph:  received call Walgreens employee 90 minutes later notified mistake. vaccinated, family given COVID-19 Vaccination Record Cards.   

It highly unlikely pharmast would *knowingly* (as opposed *mistakenly*) give not-yet-approved Pfizer vaccine 4 5 year old child, article suggested happened. Sounds like grabbed wrong vial, admitted mistake discovered. Fascinating read. Thanks. course, thread! 

The scenario “someone mystery respiratory infection. covid negative. Therefore would put droplet precautions proven otherwise. person also performing high risk procedures individual world aerosolize cov-2 anyway. room significant amount time, wouldn’t even register exposure public health sense, contact trace anyway. Simple masks fine situation.

I’m sure what’s controversial this? also depends mortality prevents people spreading it. get infected progress rapidly sick can't walk, well may spread much, knew sick short time period interacting people.

But get infected, moderate cough week two still go bar work, finally go doctor, get sent hospital, die week later, well there's massive time window transmitting disease. Masks really used school UK.

Rightly wrongly, adopted herd immunity strategy kids ensure vast majority covid-related illness occurs peak flu cold season. 

Testing popular contributing high levels ""cases"" compared nations testing kids ill. 

Contact tracing limited close contacts child tested positive. sharing classroom school areas close contacts, classmates sleepover hang outside schools might qualify.

Despite this, good news serious illness death British schoolchildren low, albeit zero. 

The high vaccination rates amongst adults even higher antibody rates across UK playing part limiting impacts wider population. makes sense able give ""complete data"" since February Russia applied. Since August Russia approved Sputnik. 


Disregard safety protocols creates mistrust. Imo,this one reason Russia got 30% fully vaccinated.  going disappear via magic miracle.

Unless count vaccine miracle. always verge right thing right thing.  

We might right thing point future.  might not.  parents since taken children pediatric cardiologist told showed signs heart issues.  

Odd. Considering vaccine trialed adult dosage age demographic ultimately lowered dosage (since effectiveness similar side-effects lower), trial data show wide-scale heart issues.  

Obviously Walgreens giving kids vaccine yet approved kids without medical supervision. I'm defending them, confused/surprised incident seemingly falls outside trial data. Although article light details ""heart issues"" were. 

I wonder dosage *also* wrong (i.e. flu shot dosage instead Pfizer vaccine dosage)?   Hello buddy, thanks lot answer reference. gave much relief! God bless you!  said lockdown, meant shutting country almost visitors, restricting movement within country.

If locally produced vaccine great, repeated donation accept foreign countries? much every batch donation detailed nightly news country donating, flight origin, time arrival, etc. least beginning, high level government officials even tarmac greet planes.

Wouldn’t mRNA vaccines better used poorer countries need vaccines more? Taiwanese definitely prefer BNT Moderna. uptake locally produced vaccine comparable, it’s people felt didn’t choice. I’m atheist, religious, would think society’s development vaccine record time would fact divine miracle. 

I can’t recall scientist quote attributed I’m paraphrasing: “science line inquiry seeks explain divine creation natural world.” short term virus would incentivized dock better ACE2 receptor, original strain binding affinity. long term would probably incentivized evade immunity become less virulent people self isolate less. 

Very bad viruses might trigger rapid adaptation host pathogen. Check cool story guy inadvertently decimated European rabbit population using pox virus pest control; bunnies died droves rebounded years later. necessarily. Pure hypothetical OP 20 parents 20 OP’s grandparents parents 20 putting grandparents 60. Also great Aunt could younger sibling grandparent. I’m 20 years older youngest sibling. great aunt could anywhere 40 100. Funny enough also Aunt 15 years younger parents. fewer Immuno-compromised sadly announced would fully vaccinate everyone city age 12 carry study safety effectiveness vaccine.  study follow participants one year investigate long vaccine protection lasts Covid-19 new virus variants.

City already 98% vaxxed least one shot. could intersting, glad done.  right, also specific example case, Delta may really affected much vaccine uptake US specifically, US bought huge portion first batch vaccines. people US rejecting chances get vaccinated early, people India even option. words, regardless whether garden variety US antivax loons existed, Delta probably would happened same.

That said, idea global pandemic may played differently US government enacted competent strategy beginning. Maybe covid would still quite bad, US aggressively gone beginning, maybe could slowed US even globally, depending many places infected people got sick US. probably depends active early communication vectors many went US. India. Fuck China.

OK.... Because? Anyone know UK Delta surge curve shaped weirdly? sure Delta changed things. I’m fortunate. work home friends vaccinated. still wear masks indoors. I’ve never enjoying big crowds anyway. risk much less many. zero delta. lots virus technologies there. However, dead inert virus type might present lots different proteins immune system harder evade whereas mRNA spike type gives prominent kind, may expect spike vaccine stronger work well variants. 

It really depends stuck virus using spike; could evolve laterally different spike might lose immunity quickly. comments literally seem AI created pfizer. anything platform unilaterally accepted  one half statements seem to, lack better term, infect sicken discourse. 

Yes, diseases evolve less deadly, evolutionary pressures make so. 

That's makes COVID-19 obnoxious, long asymptomatic period (anywhere 3 14 days) spreads like crazy. reason get less dangerous new strain could retain long incubation increase contagiousness. going spread easy. virussen infect symptoms wont become deadly.

Corona also spreads asymptomatic contagious mean deadly. fantastic needs create herd immunity. 

80% vaxxed 'where needs be'

Problem vaxxed stop getting strain, keep spreading.

Vaxxing prevent hospitalization death, stamp out. think many deadly variants going arise thanks anti-vaxx crowd. able stop anymore eventually Mmhmm yeah, I'm sure :eyeroll: love laugh logic viruses becoming less deadly, magically ignores fact covid-19 evolved become FAR deadly created pandemic first place. viruses never got deadlier would never pandemics.  nurses?  That’s see disinformation from.  might want look China manage things might teach thing two, unless think you’re somehow credible international publications. Seeing didn’t even get number vaccinations right, doubt anyone surprised clue you’re talking Sure, Delta, still believed we'd like NZ get zero. Delta trashed hope... I'm practicing agnostic. …and even stats like 300+ person “anti-vaxx” protest hometown.

Similar experience moderna breakthrough case. 4 days feeling sick, first second days really bad, second day actually feverish hysterical passing lucidity. broke, though, two easy bed rest days, nothing. Awesome news! Mutations random. may less contagious less lethal, more, combo. idea becomes less lethal time fallacy, one grounded seed truth.

Statistically, virus less lethal likely opportunity spread person mild symptoms opportunity interact people spread disease someone serious symptoms isolated feels like crap go out. course disease can't spread easily host dies.

However, mean mutation contagious lethal. means one contagious less lethal statistical evolutionary advantage strain lethal.

Additionally, mutating longer asymptomatic contagious period grants advantage, one reasons Covid general easily spread. disease could theoretically near 100% fatality rate highly successful long period gestation spread host host prior symptom onset. Correct thing pisses unvaccinated don’t realize nailing virus leads new, aggressive, variants. Romanians lot awful recent history drawn on, firmest mistrust health system Taiwan trying lockdown way pandemic. delta variant finally broke through, vaccination rate 1%, mostly healthcare workers.

So mad scramble get country vaccinated. Japan US also donated vaccines Taiwan, there’s enough vaccinate population fast enough.

While agree critics Pfizer/Moderna allow lower income countries make versions vaccines (this could subsidized US/EU), unfair attack Moderna honoring pre-existing obligations countries *have already paid* product. though, usually since variant kills host quickly can't spread well mrna every virus progress way.

This FHM also says, asked hypotetical scenario press conference. I.E, also dont think given current data. (The data still preliminary though). think repeated said. effectively said since moderna higher risk Pfizer, risk currently outweigh benefit using Moderna people age 30.

349 people currently hospital COVID (non-ICU), Netherlands 27.000 regular hospital beds. 130 people ICU. 1150 ICU beds, room scale 1500. Normally, around 800-ish beds taken people COVID, there's still plenty room.

Our hospitals fine. need proof UK vaccinated around 90% eligible population said fuck completely reopened. deaths 1/4 per capita. 

That said least thoroughly “mostly normal.” Besides masks train certain situations. Although Chicago delta didn’t fuck us like lot country. thing FHM said new data Scandinavia suggests moderna vaccine far likely cause myocarditis, specific vaccine currently outweigh risk COVID age group - hence pulling people age 30.

No, incorrect. saying press conference they, preliminary results, see significantly higher risk one mRNA vaccines other, thus cautious pauses higher risk possibly explainations come light.

Risk/benefit vaccination still outweight getting COVID, even answer hypotetic question 16 minutes in, would likely pause vaccinations risk, see difference vaccines. Delta still contagious?

It's reasonable assumption, signals data indeed case. research needed, yadda-yadda. Guess whos gona lose job lol. 🐷 arrogant “grumpy’ SOB. voted office. guess going get better everyone vaccine natural immunity.  got week ago. vaccinated too.. glad was. variants sucks man.  always case booster shots played prominent role decision Canada. Payroll Department.  Manitoba 8 weeks doses  7 week 5 days az monderna. could earlier 8 weeks data showed uk high responses. 

I don’t think anyone Canada wait 4 months. /s

Are sure? I'm certain anymore. mind much following conditions people choose get vaccinated:

1. paid sick leave get covid.
2. insurance coverage covid related illness (But premiums would otherwise go dept, shown covid acquired duty.)
3. personally sued infect someone carrying duties.
4. can't shoot someone approaches thought covid feared life. 3.35x.

200% something original 100% plus another 200%, 3x. Like 50% 1.5x.

And three times (even two times) likely significant. says average reader, using percentage. floods body shaft

🥵🥵🥵 pIlOt cRaSH bc cLoT!!1 Ugh really hate using percentages make things seem worse actually are.

2.35x still really freaking bad. people understand percentages 235% looks like crazy number.

Get vaxxed, careful, wear mask, let's get this. think similar chickenpox, bit ominous consider coronavirus version shingles might be. know decades later chicken pox could result completely different sickness/affliction later.


With 1918 pandemic, early parkinson's occurring many years infection, early onset considering age. never know specific future consequence could be, rarely (never?) good. humans lived earlier generations develop new ability avoid later health consequences associated pandemic.


The biggest risk covid children long-term issues, often starting acute infection. also something else pops 20/30/40 years? know, know enough know far-fetched possibility. people/parents see things enough reason protect children covid beyond me. 


It's prudent use hospitalization death main things use determine whether fine take little measures protect younger generation infection pandemic.....whether pandemic future one. know this. ~~No sinovac another name?~~
My mom coming visit sinovac. like 18 days know get one dose Moderna ignore second dose get j&amp;j fully vaxxed cdc card.

Edit: realized coronavac sinovac. Wrong. can’t afford anymore.  patients critical care vaccinated. Makes barkfucker.

Delta discovered. kids, little girl. entire family turned ""vaccine educated"" described believing polio vaccines, ""hoax'. 2 weeks later got seriously ill breathing problems. almost went hospital. daughter birthday August, party, could invite friend. daughter told her
It's family vaccinated. friend started pushing religion daughter even invited us church. explain, politely, socializing pandemic, never mentioned fact odds beliefs. Honestly care believe makes good people. disease vector willingly necessarily good.

My daughter like playing much anymore, friend bossy, religious, rude, sad. sweet girl lot problems, seemingly caused parents. able play real life waned patience. hate timeline. interesting implications long covid studies consider anxiety/depression 3+ months covid infection without symptoms ""long covid"".

If take assumption every anxiety/depression people covid caused infection, what's going society, think fair assume noone without covid infection get depressed/anxious pandemic - think plausible say covid get depressed state world immune that. either a) get depressed pandemic, whether personally covid not, b) can't get depressed pandemic, get depressed covid. 

If b), logically, could use estimates estimates long covid different countries.

If a), long covid studies counting people anxiety/depression long covid symptoms wrong include counts. Cool! 

Just time holidays!  forget animal reservoirs, fancy way saying certain animals catch spread covid too. So, - actually NEVER chance nail virus down. It’s completely false say that. 

As long creature earth capable getting spreading covid, opportunities outbreaks.

On positive note, that’s develop vaccines treatments limit deadly potential covid outbreaks occur. shits giggles, let's address question 85th time since can't bothered actually read thread spread ignorance over. 

What describing, using isolation quarantine eradicate virus, impossible (as already shown many times). 

Even hyper localized population, like know, New Zealand, able eradicate isolation, simple reasons. 

1. Delta variant incredibly contagious spreads asymptomatically, spread visible. 

2. level isolation that's needed combat kind spread possible people require goods, services, supplies order live, *always* level travel occurring. Even close businesses lock people houses, *someone* need bring food supply. level infrastructure ratchets quickly would **significant** service entire community/city/country. 

3. virus live surfaces, yes, stated previously, animals. ***You get f#cking cat***. 

So even ***if*** able quarantine humans level stopped spread completely (which can't, NZ Australia showing), virus would resurge soon quarantine lifted would either make way back community outside source, ***it would transfer animal reservoir back human begin spreading again***. 

Ignoring fact even localized eradication impossible (seriously, actual reading), spread would commence starting one sources. 

So yes, acting like fool, need listening spend less energy sad attempts preserving fragile ego. Thankfully, vaccines work. Shut dribble unless agree us - laura ingraham. hope feel better nice rant. UK ton testing they’re probably getting lot asymptomatic cases people missing.  

There also literally restrictions mask requirements UK. (Public transport mask mandates un-enforced little compliance) School districts across state granting exemptions, Mukilteo example 97 apply exemption, 97 granted. Maybe offer reassurance vaccines indeed safe effective.

In response, security officer getting stabbed mask Science - real source miracles. Maybe new variant Covid-19. One show PCR tests. Prove wrong. since received much stock India

5m total 95m used far. delayed go quality checks twice due unusual results.  Depends entirely incubation period. actually matter whether kill host walk around infecting others two weeks even know they're stick. mom would call church “liberal”.

Am assume L-word bad context?   take good either. anti-vaxxers every country, percentages rivalling US.  Fewer fewer. America, vaccinated take part stuff. long everything virtual. suspicious virus targeting unvaccinated people? Really makes think. whole reason Southern Baptist denomination established Southern Baptist leaders supported slavery whole Northern Baptist opposed. experience growing Southern Baptist churches child, much changed views since 1845. Yes,

So what's point? great YouTube song!  refuse hospitalisation. take beds refuse medical care. got Pfizer back March. Got breakthrough case 2 weeks ago. felt feverish first day, 100.8F temp. gone within 24 hours. felt overall fatigue lasted another day. lingering congestion, might allergies that. similar felt 2nd shot. felt symptoms, knew going test positive. Overall bad all, minor inconvenience. vaccine job. 10 day quarantine annoying honestly. cancel bunch plans reschedule stuff. Instacart savior getting groceries.

My kids got it, got it, whatever reason wife get it. got Pfizer back May. testing twice week whole time still negative. confirm covid passed via sexual transmission, lol. kids (6 3 yrs old) asymptomatic, thank goodness. got precious anti bodies now, least.  ""People self-isolate Covid-19 symptoms even negative PCR test result, according regional public health official, number cases people tested positive using lateral flow tests – negative PCR.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), replaced Public Health England start October, said believe problems testing kits added evidence new variant.

Dr Zoe Price’s daughter Rosie one developed symptoms earlier week. positive lateral flow test results, two negative PCR tests.

The 14-year-old later spent day hospital becoming dehydrated result illness.

Price, A&amp;E doctor Bath, told Guardian: “She became ill Tuesday vomiting bug, think people started vomiting school. lateral flow, thought, ‘It’s going Covid,’ strongly positive. multiple ones, positive, friends.

“Then lost sense smell, classic Covid symptom – PCR negative, friend PCR negative, went another one negative.”""

(...) death statistics entire pandemic (original Covid plus variants). isolate last months death rate would higher, that’s population many vaccinated! ""Today's phrase 'public responsibility'.""

Americans: ""What fuck that?"" LOL ""Let's take anti-vaxxers put there"" break guitar too?   Even mask, stopped entering apple store fucking knife! Seriously, normal ppl carry knife visiting store?  Yes, another possibility. people also report Covid like symptoms like loss taste too. Weird vaccine devil many idiots. could mostly done hole thing. power misinformation failed educational system.

Edit: Go ahead delete comment like always do, mods.. make less true. makes shills.   multiple states 0.3% population died close 1 300 people died. would become scary 1% would 1 100, 10% would 1 10 (still 90% survival). Even 0.3% scares crap lower bound everyone states infected clearly closer 1%.....why math sooo hard.  friend shared post FB couple he's close to. 60's fully vaxxed Moderna. ended breakthrough infection. woman mild case. guy, unfortunately, ended hospital ventilator week. He's finally off, starting better. doctors/nurses keep telling he'd sure dead vaccinated.   good, like said, travelling anytime soon. Doesn’t bother all.  variant vaccine-resistant previous variants, say “sEe tOlD VaCcINeS dON’t wOrk,” stop drooling long enough get words thing get pastor finding WAY say mixed race relationships wrong.

People wore masks properly initial months delta wave. Beyond big cities, almost one wears any. vax people mostly belong two groups. People personality disorders absolutely cannot handle ""being told do"" mentally unstable conspiracy theorists.

I think summed well. exact thing happen Australia month ago. sister got it, mum made real plans isolate separate rooms assumed would get it. hugging eating food together etc, watched movies together without masks 4-5 days. mum got tested again. mum positive, wasn't. mum shots AZ basically hayfever like symptoms, I'm still waiting second dose pfizer (at point sister got it, first dose around week this). sister vaccination yet eligble end month. this, begun isolating room chance get it, another 2 weeks go mum tested positive, collected another 2 negative results. symptoms, nothing. never even got it, even spending time two infectious people (particularly sister quite sick) face face hours time. sure make explain it.

Good guys!   Would dox church myself.  Yes. work existing strains, likely work new strains emerge. also almost overweight, too.  plan travel abroad, aware countries don’t recognize mixed doses full vaccination. might want stick either mRNA, instead going yet another brand.  restrictions good reason.

yeah reason called bigotry imperialism specially since received much stock India . Covax , look article Risks everyone went bit. Vaccines help normalize it, yeah, never going back 2019. Across US, pharmacies throwing thousands doses people want expire.

So it’s either shots American arms drain. can’t magically refreeze vials, pack ship countries. It’s never “ending”. It’s going reach livable point.

Well, 'livable' us least... guitar.  church go to? Would love learn Glad get vaccines.

Completely totally baffled nearly universal rejection blood transfusions. false, hate hearing it. tend become efficient surviving, becoming less lethal *one possibility* others actually mean lethal less treatable strains become dominant.  

The Next Chapter Viral Arms Race (Archive link original paywalled) mean doubt response really good they’ve bought lot time vaccinate, getting zero near impossible. It’s likely Moderna booster half strength regular Moderna shot. aware travel, countries recognize mixed vaccination full vaccination.  Yes. Tested several days ago today. negative. asymptomatic. Blows mind TBH. started staying elsewhere tested positive point life usual 3 days. Kissing kids goodnight sharing bed wife. figured head cold life normal. 

Again, suspect vaccine may reduced contagious thats pure speculation point.  hope…. That's honestly better expected. got late start, meantime ridiculous low death rate. Even shit hits fan, they'll miles ahead developed countries. Oh gotcha makes sense know jehovahs witnesses also agree vaccination personal choice limp dick becomes medical emergency. problem delays inevitable.

If look longitudinal studies. first 3 days, vaccinated person unvaccinated person roughly delta viral load 3 days vaccinated person starts drop. That's long takes immune system gear beat back virus. immune system prompted vaccine. takes 9 days see immune system unvaccinated person start beating back virus. Alot damage 9 days. WTFFFFFF fucking pharmacist EVER change prescriptions IDGAF think are!! Thats damn lawsuit waiting happen!!  Could 5x dosage flu-vaccine volume. Holy shit, right. I'm corona steps prevent comments one dimensional. No, tall, good as. article. 7 8 incremental gains waiting seem within margin error It’s 2890(NY) 2627(FL) still counting high delta wave, NY lost 30,000 first wave, vastly different responses numbers show  guy reddit defending filling changing prescriptions doctors ""If like go somewhere else"" attitude.  defensive it, like able second guess doctors reasons.

I find easy believe this... wish didn't. Overcoming deep rooted fears bravest thing world. already got replies, estimating long time sounds like brand-new vaccine technology. mRNA COVID-19 vaccines fast partially just-invented technology: pretty much come theory vaccinate SARS, done SARS outbreak already ended.

Still shocking, number associated nice.

So... who's supposed it? support mandate, who's supposed enforce mandate? live Canada double vaccinated.

If gov wanted ensure people listened them, way consistent messaging done better job managing whole thing.

* International travelling still allowed
* quarantine optional coming back int travelling wanted pay fee
* gov officials vacationing across world people allowed cross provincial borders, flying driving
* stores allowed operate multi billion dollar corporations, essentially killing small businesses
* Parliament gov officials need vaccinated, tons businesses forced make mandatory

The list goes on. messed we're paying price. I'm total baby comes needles. I'm also hypochondriac gets panic attacks convince I'm going 1 million guy bad side effect. get mine one beds surrounded curtains around side clinic pussies 😅

I still managed get shots soon possible realized protecting family fellow Canadians important irrational fears. hope feel better soon g.  Pretty much brings IFR widely-publicized CFRs (with well-functioning medical system). Delta pretty much coronavirus lot laypeople (who understand difference IFR vs CFR) feared original was, much transmissible. know long covid now, really worried March 2020. 

Otoh, multiple vaccines. boosters, we're still way better start metric. even without boosters, far better terms fatality rate vaccinated people Delta unvaccinated people WT.  One methods testing wide swaths people testing sewage. I'm sure irt it, effective getting idea what's happening large populations.

But also there's testing individual cases. need test understand what's going on, like polling need phone everyone. part sheer number cases places necessitated triaging care, leading people would lived getting earlier access ICU someone worse already there? Aka malpractice currently allowed Tennessee. Possibly. seem lot inefficient redundant policies comes studies though knows. Cool! Going get flu shot soon then.  Nope. said fine get multiple vaccines give fucks anymore

this happens give 0 fucks something know dangerous. actively chose pay consequences like stepped traffic eyes closed, along harm causes others. choose harm others petty reasons... We're 45%. partner's job requesting conduct many meetings virtually right now. workplace (with 200+ employees) also hosting *indoor* Halloween event employees kids year. Still trying figure one out. like want God personally come thier house face palm miricle know expert said coronavirus mutated deadly would destroy spike protein destroy itself. 

That makes sense established virus host. virus managed cross species barrier, mostly likely optimized way, course improve multiple ways time. 

Granted, deadly goal viruses. anything, bad thing. prioritizing short-term growth long-term sustainability really matter easily jump exploiting new resource (another body). like virus going fine-tune deadliness much maximize fitness. things trade-off between. think anyone ever lumped people medically can't get vaccine people refuse to. always explicitly stated obvious. limp dick becomes medical emergency. 

 
 dick pills*. Stupid auto correct.

Misinformation idiot Facebook, pillow guy, Joe rogan etc etc say horse paste cure covid 0 knowledge virology virologist world agrees vaccine works. Hopefully. Winter mid-next year NZ, think chances good we’ll good vaccine rate then.

Yeah, us trying anti-vax idiot brigade holding us back. There's reason rightfully despised selfish stupid fucks are. believe god multiple people far fetched believe satan too. elderly immune suppressed people get flu shot twice one season, I've never heard reformulating flu shots half way season.

Maybe finally watched college football game 70000 fans thought himself, let plebs pagan rituals   numerous published stories low vaccination rates police officers country. It’s problem many cities/counties. living rock “pro” police can’t bear accept anything negative them? massively month ago Thankfully, masks. addition vaccines. statements correct.

However, previously stated, main transmission method Covid-19 via respiratory droplets, masks prevent spread of. Lmfao, always China comparison. Misinformation means intentionally misleading, reporting best information time turning wrong. What?

How advocate vaccines, state think effective coronavirus vaccine end badly?  flu vaccine good six months healthy immune system. August early, mid-October usually okay.

But make choice based flu season live. I'm Virginia, flu season definitely started here. state may different. think parallel here. people believe robust public education believe vaccines. 
They think special. think exceptions. think answers.   buckle ur seatbelts.  Yes! Finally says something based common fucking sense Wales Online article:

""A severe cold dubbed 'the worst lurgy ever' could actually Covid-19, leading scientist suggested.

People around UK reported suffering nasty cold flooring people weeks time.

It comes England’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer issued warning influenza ""significant public health concern"" winter.

But Professor Tim Spector, lead scientist ZOE Covid study app, warned confusing Covid cold easily done could help virus spread, reports Mirror.""

etc.

Maybe new I’m nonviolent person, would *very* hard time punching someone wearing yellow star protest wearing mask pandemic. Isn’t IFR basically guessing point? little available testing earlier pandemic, we’re still terrible testing compared developed nations. simply don’t know, therefore could estimate actual number Covid infections. likely death toll underrepresented current count.

I'm saying intentionally infect Alpha laboratory setting. Get jab get virus. Boom, herd immunity.

That isn’t exactly works people get COVID-19 receive protection reinfection – natural immunity nonexistent. recent study found 36% COVID-19 cases result development SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. people different levels illness – moderate disease, asymptomatic experienced severe Natural immunity decay within 90 days. Immunity COVID-19 vaccines shown last longer. Pfizer Moderna reported strong vaccine protection least six Studies ongoing evaluate full duration protective immunity, including Johnson &amp; Johnson Real-world studies also indicate natural immunity's short life. example, 65% people lower baseline antibody infection begin completely lost COVID-19 antibodies 60 Israeli study suggesting natural immunity stronger?

I'd too. live town lowest vaccination rate state that's something like 34th vaccinations could use evolution here. Sadly, last 20 years apparent we've going opposite way.

I feel like media bad job clearly conveying part. explained contagious sure, detail communicated well. Thank u math 🙏 One needs look India. doesnt differ much. point vaccine trigger defence system prepared getting infected. Vaccine antibiotics/medicine. Queensland Western Australia contained Delta repeatedly, even Victoria managed contain delta outbreak NSW fucked over

It’s entirely possible people follow rules. Nah, government gave week ago.

They're still using restrictions try slow country panics way vaccination program (that government fucked massively) fast possible.

But current level restrictions dont stop delta, we're far behind jabs, theres zero-level natural immunity NZ help slow it. going get REALLY bad summer. Gasp Incredible even police doubling make clear protect serve intimidate harm. 30s got J&amp;J vaccine. Still bad case. like week. actually researching years. link somewhere...
Idk allowed tho delete. better papers sort cliff notes. make sense impression danger Covid still running strong, even currently available vaccines. Oregon saw huge spike vaccinated Covid deaths august, 23% remember correctly. thought Covid ops story meant fight, mutating enough lower effectiveness current vaccines. Sorry I’m argumentative I’m trying wrap head around it. seems like states buckling harder restrictions try fight it. doesn’t make sense see light end tunnel. mom's church absolutely believes large portion congregation vaccinated. lost parishioners covid they've followed guidelines, masking, held virtual services bible studies. I'm sure there's others one reporting holding example. Shame. factual statement?

Well super fast... [because one lady working mRNA vaccines yeah, problem vaccinated anywhere globally, travelling anywhere outside country. gonna mess! developed

Speed *adapted*.

If fools actually ""done research"" they'd found first heard mrna vaccine covid. mrna therapy first theorized 60s, tech evolved enough 80 90s put practice. 

They trust told trust it. Lemmings. love pointing part vaccines studied tested safety decade... components far longer. Jesus. thought United bad kinda perfect storm too. companies got blank check develop vaccine. Most, labs world around clock developing vaccine. time developing vaccine finding money development clinical trials. Due pandemic weren’t problem anymore. really shows cusp human brilliance. even 10 years ago could develop vaccine distribute around world fast. think mRNA vaccines proposed like 3 years ago. imagine destruction Delta would caused vaccines become widely available US prior becoming widespread here.

We got very, lucky talking buddy boat - sick week beats hell hospital    Yeah know  bad even reasonable people acknowledge COVID vaxx mask still love lecture definitely created lab. Nobody live Alberta told could wait 4 months. got mine 2 estimate given. always wondered employees would trained enforce mask vaccine mandates.  short answer people going fund it. reason current vaccines developed fast governments companies threw money various vaccine developers wake immediate danger. immediate danger ""gone"" development new vaccine potential future pandemic likely gonna along lines ""we'll cross bridge get there"" ""Delta less deadly, viruses get less deadly time.""

Good know data counter old chestnut. adapts much better do.  used failing airline. also really amibvalent towards COVID, brought back airline, he'd probably hire unvaccinated. Yeah keep tearing forests get rid factories it'll keep happening might get something far deadlier covid. wake call instead huge amount people purposefully closing eyes it.

Altogether, 35% say one *main* reason got vaccinated.   90% adult (18+) population. total population, Malaysia 65% fully vaccinated Singapore 80%. 

Though think mentioned that:

1. Singapore's population older Malaysia, Singapore bigger proportion population already eligible vaccination compared Malaysia.

2. Malaysia started vaccinating 18s month ago. Right now, 72% 12-17 year olds received least one dose 7% fully vaccinated. there's still room Malaysia's fully vaccinated rate grow adolescents get second dose.     would expiration date vaccine medicine matter long it’s provided expiration date? odd seems like disingenuous question? may variant escaped lab tests “robust immune system” line makes roll eyes extra hard.

Explain dexamethasone became global standard severe covid.

It's use 60 years, dirt cheap makes, there's dozens manufacturers world over. Nobody stood make substantial profit it.

Yet strength evidence, became standard severe covid. still standard treatment.

There's lot legitimate problems, massive conspiracies suppress cheap treatments pharma companies, medical research doctors world, issue covid. get idiots overdosing veterinary formulations ivermectin.

The fact study published prestigious journal others look either confirm refute benefit makes claim false. **This clinical trial**. Somebody funded it. results high impact journal. Assuming serious flaws uncovered, trials done. replicate findings, this, like cheap treatments, become part standard recommendations. need new drug approval administer something like this. new drug. *already* allowed given humans.

I think actually familiar much work investigating potential treatments done. Conspiracy theories people ignorant issues detract addressing real problems. articles produced created YLE government owned operated News agency. read Finnish, lived 3 years. little difference two articles. 

Yleisradio Oy (Finnish, literally ""General Radio Ltd."" ""General Broadcast Ltd.""; abbr. Yle \[ˈyle\]; Swedish: Rundradion Ab), translated English Finnish Broadcasting Company, Finland's national public broadcasting company, founded 1926. joint-stock company 99.98% owned Finnish state, employs around 3,200 people Finland.

Unlike vaccines based inert forms specific virus. probably asymptotic. Childish response. game. dick measure comparison. I‘m anti vaxx, … Good ol religion... I've saying nearly year half: COVID selection pressures viruses delayed onset, asymptomatic spread, varying symptom severity. 

Moreover, Spanish Flu became deadly deadliest strains died (because herd effect [partial herd immunity] health measures), leaving less-deadly strains. I’ve developed cough recently mild also feels like deeply rooted. isn’t completely dry cough, though. Kind annoying slightly concerning. doesn’t dry cough covid, right? I’m early 20s fully vaccinated. Thinking Delta might possibility, shall get test.  Talk doctor, don’t listen people Reddit comes medical advice. nice day!  Study Ontario Feb June, people even vaccinated.

Also effects present even researchers adjusted data factors age, sex, vaccination status, comorbidities. Finn here, click bait article. read article says people refusing participate testing new drugs. refusing treatment itself. hospitals want people get sick hospitalised also participate drug testing programs, refusing take part programs, actual treatment.

Classic Yle lol, making misleading headlines Pfizer far behind. also lower dose compared Moderna. mean I’m pessimistic person below, yeah it’s looking highly likely it’s going keep going up. good thing. literally coming together silly response. keep use. people casually might take second 2 ring old brain fog.

It's important realize normal thing factor use knowledge see manipulation. I'd disagree. parents church may following guidelines, way representative majority. majority churches refused follow shutdown guidelines unless absolutely forced to. majority enforcing mask policy. reason hear churches ones making noise, god damn even it. town live 30 churches. Probably more. one churches enforce masks. one stayed closed longer month last year state shut down. majority doing. definitely agree hate anytime something compared use percentage chance difference rather percentile difference.


Like odds something vs another thing 1\*10^-100 % vs 1\*10^-99 % say ""[Thing] 1000% WORSE!!!!!!!.

Its often missing important context seems alarmist be. Like example, that's percentage chance, basically 0, probably care, seeing 1000% might pretty alarmed.

I view way lying honestly statistics.

In case, think there's enough context, seen many examples without clearly dishonest clickbait definitely agree general. People really quickly forgot mass funeral pyres  didn’t really ask either… Really appreciate put button skip next article directly top close button giant ad fills half screen. can’t stop delta, without high rates vaccination, going get absolutely brutal, extremely fast. Vaccines prevent severe illness death; spread infection cannot stopped.

You really don’t know there; sincerely hope New Zealand become tragic footnote coming weeks.

Stay safe, kiwi friends. Buckle good luck. cousin vaccinated, sick right now. Can't taste anything. able finally convince husband weeks ago get vaccinated, he's sick second dose. looks like he's going okay, hope wakeup call take little seriously. 

My sister staying mom sick cancer, died. sis came back mom's house couple weeks ago start handling legal stuff follows parent's death. I'm glad we're cousin's everyone sick. I've made time (to knowledge) without getting it, got vaccinated soon open me.    Yes. 

From you’ve seen news. hit nail head there.

Most Aussies happy bit society US spinning like we’re North Korea something. 

My hot take: it’s jealousy amount deaths year covid America like every day seems.

COVID zero happening.  I'm aware studies evangelical Christians largest antivax group today, especially covid, really want see see study regarding kindergarten report cards, letter grades got working well others, sharing, etc. confirm suspicions. adds confusion me. 

I interpret 50% higher 1.5x, 235% 2.35x higher 3.35x?  introduced already. Guess waiting fully approved/voted such. looked paper uses notation 235% elevation risk, meaning 3.35X Results: cohort included 212 326 people. Compared non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, adjusted elevation risk associated N501Y-positive variants 52% (95% confidence interval [CI] 42%–63%) hospitalization, 89% (95% CI 67%–117%) ICU admission 51% (95% CI 30%–78%) death. Increased risk Delta variant pronounced 108% (95% CI 78%–140%) hospitalization, 235% (95% CI 160%–331%) ICU admission 133% (95% CI 54%–231%) death. Exactly. that’s people. Except offer. offered sell **discount** African Union, stipulation get shipped next year, still fulfilling pre-existing orders. African Union rejected offer, NY Times trying make Madera bad guy here.

There's in-depth comment ripping article apart above. Worth read see bogus headline is.  tossup understand math. say wrong, thought experiment using ""100% higher risk"" another example, realized, oh, yeah, 100% higher means 2X risk. examples hold, too. common virus able use antibiotic neutralise it.

Antibiotics used bacterial infections. kill bacteria. can’t kill virus alive.  friend UK share experience arranging visa visit US, requested social media accounts *and passwords* order get visa. getting flight. get that, could like miracle vaccine much effective current vaccines wouldn’t 1 quick turnaround well? We've contained pretty well lockdowns.

Elimination like We've previously... knows. curious, 90% 16+ population 73% total population. Obviously risk profile changed way, (masks longer required, outdoor activities moving indoors, etc.) would reassess time.  Well (a number states Australia done multiple times)

But go hard, early, lucky. 1st. Fire him..2nd replace HS coach, win Delta [pushing Sure, NZ's version ""eased restrictions"" still restrictive almost anyone else's. AFAIK, definition, sheriff's department LA County.

Then it’s also largest Must special anti-vaxx religion lots drugs limit well.    Rapid reinfection rare, even original strain. One wife's clients, 28 year last year, caught covid twice within 2 month mid 2020. think point best choice may depend local factors (both related prevalence variants disease, rate spread, well supply cultural resistance low rates vaccination surrounding population). 

On entirely different tangent: everyone child's school fully vaccinated child yet, might higher risk activities less conscientious masks, may drop masks altogether, case would want child's protection do.  Well would they? Cops don’t give anybody unless it’s another cop Europe. Though someone said EU accepting US proof vaccination, would huge fucking hole system. America, why, ffs? Tech leadership, remember? Might tough vaccinated abroad traveling domestically within US. 2.35x still really freaking bad. people understand percentages 235% looks like crazy number.

The best part understand percentages either. 3.35x, explains. Except wasn’t. 

One dose AZ mRNA high effectiveness blocking severe COVID Original strain alpha. 


Getting majority population one dose far beneficial getting 1/2 two doses.  studies pre-prints showing single doses 70-80 % effective blocking infections higher blocking severe COVID. talking COVID vaccines, speedy turnaround atypical. Quite honestly percentages like misused, even smart people, could easily mean it’s 2.35x 3.35x worse. Tossup really Apparently. Coz god's will, really exist, whatever. Yeah, want people taking covid prevention measures seriously lol Yeah, ""just flu"" people never flu bug results days sick can't even manage *call in* work, makes feel like burning hot also shivering cold, gives headache encompassing pain bones—which feel like they're ground dust. can't stand long minute ready fall fair could also lead turning less deadly variant. using Stuff figure still sub 80%! 

So 81% first dose pretty fucking good. Stoked that. CVS charged insurance $50 per Moderna shot. Pretty sure that's worth poster's piece mind. likely insurance company care, given cheap vaccine compared hospitalization antibody treatment costs. However, probably better wait Moderna booster approved since dosage decreased. [MOH vaccine Depends site look at! come contact virus, certain amount tries invade system. immune system always fight back and, viral load enough allow spread, infected. vaccinated makes immune system better getting rid virus, thus increasing viral load necessary cause infection, reducing duration infection reducing odds virus able cause significant damage.

So catch virus still die it, vaccinated makes harder virus progress steps. due lockdown fatigue Auckland evidence people breaking lockdown, necessarily honest contact tracing efforts. Gov Ministry Health decided ease push vaccination rather police harder build distrust. 

Ultimately, going happen opened country anyway, Gov appears taking chin pushing through. PM outreach tour right risk areas (low vaccination rates) encourage support efforts.

All all, great terrible either. Constant messaging government is: ""If people get vaccinated, lockdowns"" working big time. Maybe it’s Hank Pym bloodstream messing cells MCU cryptic warning something real. Prove wrong. really. Mutations make macroscale alterations. we're talking efficacy we're seeing 94% alpha drop 88% delta here.

The significant factor play length time since 2nd dose - studies show immunity wanes significantly 8 months post vaccination boosters needed Holy shit wrong. No, Ministry Health increased recommendation, however due current outbreak, changed recommendation back 21 days.  79% one dose :)

Second doses becoming available people got vaccinated. 

Lots outreach work going reach skeptical populations groups.

PM rounds hardest reach areas reassure encourage. 

Honestly, mass vaccination drives around country performing better expected I've read. single incident Muslim mob attacking doctors Hyderabad. remember exact reason was. yeah overworked doctors exactly sensitive easily agitate someone who's family member dying. one's fault exactly. India needs lot doctors pandemic scale. *based one study Canada looked 200,000 cases, 6,000 Delta variant.

Not casting doubt, feel like would like additional info near headline. Recognised. cities higher risk transmission. Also wearing mask fines imposed (and mention sticks would thrown random police personnel). wearing mask common villages actual hotspots get fined probably beaten little too. Ok and?   responsible church would telling members truth: sin lie spread lies, applies virus misinformation/disinformation.

You ask chaplain came  still everyone acting like pandemic refusing get vaccinated COVID: hold beer, let demonstrate pandemic works! 🤧🤒😵 Yeah thats thought. COVID symptoms?

Due unnecessary politization situation ""Still-the still yet mention credentials.

Yeah I'm **political science professor**, see, I'm bit expert. heed speculations regarding vaccine happening globally geopolitical definition.

No lol, geopolitical means policies affected regional politics geography, pandemic global medical situation mere virtue involving regions, entire planet involved, playing favorites regionalism stupid wrong pandemic control, proven US covid status throughout entire think single country refuses ""accept Sputnik""

Its single influential one refusing, one pressuring others to. US follows anti-vax strategy leadership level one anti-vax countries go read couple books

I have, thats I'm unimpressed US anti-vaxer excuses approve talk vaccines, least helpful country Earth pandemic.  breakthrough reinfection? might want talk doctor testing/checking see you’re immunocompromised, reinfection somewhat rare breakthrough reinfection practically unicorn status. ~11k reinfections(out 1.3 million overall cases) North Carolina, 200 vaccinated.

Yesterday friend mine told Pfizer extended expiration date vaccines (I also found news: concerned?

Also, told Pfizer's legal history (that easily find concerned?

Thank all! friend refuses people’s blood he’s JW. Dude almost died it, somehow pulled through. He’s guy everything work somehow even shouldn’t. Dude’s got good heart though, know he’d back needed to, don’t really question it. Yea doesn’t make sense mum exposed person equally. think datas changed lot delta, almost sisters close contacts got  I'm glad state overall well, Central NY, positivity rate still increasing slightly, well downstate. suspect many unvaccinated yahoos around here, Covid chewing them. wearing masks public more. hope peaks soon. lost testicle due torsion literally beds OR's open. Fuck anti vaxxers. vast majority people Russia traveled outside town. assure you, vast majority Russians either never heard WHO, give 0 shits it.  may harmless people, makes herpes worse. Everybody popping like sweeties good idea. must say, Russian, always find amusing Americans tell ""how is"" community.  What’s point? study size massive 6000 cases delta also huge sample draw conclusions from. work statistics big sample.   seriously saying that’s impossible? evidence Delta effect vaccination hesitancy? can't normal life anymore.  Can't carry virus have. catch all. considering mRNA vaccine weakened strained, shed anything. Herd immunity would possible everyone that's normal would get 2 shots us risk factors take 3.


The reason got third round heart surgery 2 heart still considered defective. lungs absolute shit severe asthma whole life steroids used control it, stunted lungs growing. 2 risk categories. push front line get shots hospital work at. Cause need shot work with.      world talking lmao.

All said assuming doesn’t covid someone walking doesn’t need n95. I’m explaining droplet precautions are.

Honestly everyday life you’re fine mask. You’re face face someone covid+ intubating, you’re room probably &lt;15 minutes.

I mean fuck dude, say do. I’ve emergency medicine good 12 years. never used wear kind ppe. barely knew someone TB day later, nice little email get. best practice giving view reality medicine Good seeing benefit, sorry go that! Flu shot like covid vaccine: designed keep 1) ICU, 2) alive. Getting flu covid definitely sucks doesn't, know, represent vaccine failure. success! Vaccines cause adults, say, since I'm pediatrician. know expert said coronavirus mutated deadly would destroy spike protein destroy itself. months ago though can't find said it. Maybe others better luck Google I'm know I'm talking about. Ha! I'll use one. That's perfect! could isn’t public policy, doesn’t need support. work. Sarcasm usually marked /s prevent misunderstanding. Thanks. thus far doctors spreading covid misinformation held accountable. 

That’s it’s newsworthy. new SARS-like viruses continue emerge, UCI team working nonstop last 18 months develop mRNA vaccine prototype, could eventually delivered patch, intranasal spray pill taken orally.

You could try reading article. accomplish anything. Police come call retail related issues. worked Lowe's Austin, tried time report incidents police show help. come. show up, show 1-2 hours call. person long gone then.

Now someone angry, screaming employees, unhinged told called police, making unhinged attack you. People shocked 60, meanwhile Turkey 30K day people acting like chilltime Tennessee take licenses Florida probably invite come practice there. ""b-b-but viruses mutate less dangerous!"" Sadly stock never replenished 44, 45 prior outbreak hit get enough population/healthcare industry people, replenish stock case couldn’t produce again, basically restocked produced time. somewhat get this, somewhat. know plenty bought n95 privately spent money themselves. would changed filtration systems schools public buildings could changed curve. probably could made life better esp kids. Sadly neither admin done still don’t. main issue vaccines, air n95 production. wrong several things. outbreak May caused alpha variant. Several delta clusters started, subsequently crushed. soft lockdown mostly voluntary. government instituted mandatory contact tracing, suspended types venues helped spark outbreak, started mask mandate. never travel restrictions mandates work home. encouraged. hardly counts ""trying lockdown way pandemic"". Last, uptake Medigen vaccine comparable vaccines. Come r/Taiwan daily update Taiwan's COVID outbreak. didn’t know November already. everyone decided ignore coronavirus bored, there's vaccine. vaccine overwhelmingly effective point well 90 percent covid patients unvaccinated. Kids can't get vaccinated, according CDC 576 700k deaths people age 18. 

So basically everyone dying coronavirus chose die coronavirus. Naturally, people enthusiastic making sacrifices protect people stupidity, especially people actively insulting vaccinated individuals.

There's corporate conspiracy, human nature. -- Delta variant 235% higher risk ICU admission original virus

Do issues reading?  Guess again. International opening date november NSW Oh gotcha. know trying make point comment? so, point clear. ""Civil rights protestors"" ""armed public employees"". 

No one fucks police, far well-paid, well-organized criminal gang America. can’t believe employers haven’t figured yet.

“no”

 “ok I’m calling police sign complaints trespassing”. nothing else. aren’t willing sign complaints trespassing appear court witness, there’s nothing anyways. point? (sounds like high risk category fact succumbed really come surprise).  There’s also stupid people    Summary 
Background 
Before 2020, mental disorders leading causes global health-related burden, depressive anxiety disorders leading contributors burden. emergence COVID-19 pandemic created environment many determinants poor mental health exacerbated. need up-to-date information mental health impacts COVID-19 way informs health system responses imperative. study, aimed quantify impact COVID-19 pandemic prevalence burden major depressive disorder anxiety disorders globally 2020. 
Methods 
We conducted systematic review data reporting prevalence major depressive disorder anxiety disorders COVID-19 pandemic published Jan 1, 2020, Jan 29, 2021. searched PubMed, Google Scholar, preprint servers, grey literature sources, consulted experts. Eligible studies reported prevalence depressive anxiety disorders representative general population COVID-19 pandemic pre-pandemic baseline. used assembled data meta-regression estimate change prevalence major depressive disorder anxiety disorders pre-pandemic mid-pandemic (using periods defined study) via COVID-19 impact indicators (human mobility, daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, daily excess mortality rate). used model estimate change pre-pandemic prevalence (estimated using Disease Modelling Meta-Regression version 2.1 \[known DisMod-MR 2.1\]) age, sex, location. used final prevalence estimates disability weights estimate years lived disability disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) major depressive disorder anxiety disorders. 
Findings 
We identified 5683 unique data sources, 48 met inclusion criteria (46 studies met criteria major depressive disorder 27 anxiety disorders). Two COVID-19 impact indicators, specifically daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rates reductions human mobility, associated increased prevalence major depressive disorder (regression coefficient \[B\] 0·9 \[95% uncertainty interval 0·1 1·8; p=0·029\] human mobility, 18·1 \[7·9 28·3; p=0·0005\] daily SARS-CoV-2 infection) anxiety disorders (0·9 \[0·1 1·7; p=0·022\] 13·8 \[10·7 17·0; p&lt;0·0001\]. Females affected pandemic males (B 0·1 \[0·1 0·2; p=0·0001\] major depressive disorder, 0·1 \[0·1 0·2; p=0·0001\] anxiety disorders) younger age groups affected older age groups (−0·007 \[–0·009 −0·006; p=0·0001\] major depressive disorder, −0·003 \[–0·005 −0·002; p=0·0001\] anxiety disorders). estimated locations hit hardest pandemic 2020, measured decreased human mobility daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, greatest increases prevalence major depressive disorder anxiety disorders. estimated additional 53·2 million (44·8 62·9) cases major depressive disorder globally (an increase 27·6% \[25·1 30·3\]) due COVID-19 pandemic, total prevalence 3152·9 cases (2722·5 3654·5) per 100 000 population. also estimated additional 76·2 million (64·3 90·6) cases anxiety disorders globally (an increase 25·6% \[23·2 28·0\]), total prevalence 4802·4 cases (4108·2 5588·6) per 100 000 population. Altogether, major depressive disorder caused 49·4 million (33·6 68·7) DALYs anxiety disorders caused 44·5 million (30·2 62·5) DALYs globally 2020. 
Interpretation 
This pandemic created increased urgency strengthen mental health systems countries. Mitigation strategies could incorporate ways promote mental wellbeing target determinants poor mental health interventions treat mental disorder. Taking action address burden major depressive disorder anxiety disorders option. Anecdotally someone worked vaccine clinic start surge, definitely saw pretty huge (50-100%l increases vaccination weeks- initial wave fence-sitters got second doses slowed pretty significantly 3rd doses recently approved. we're 6-8x many 3rd doses 1st doses day. People say generally think viruses propagate independently host like bacteria yeah, b4 vaccines available, 'friends' thought since never went safe. ""I've got stronk immune system"" i'm level 69. still fucking bed bound, sick april 2020. plz love fucking god figure treatment. rate higher Singapore? sting  took work next day expecting worst, nothing. actually wish reaction. would felt like working.  work misinformation delicensure applied misinformation coronavirus vaccines. People say stuff like forget takes get there. still goal still pretty much true. mean Corona either going slowly become less concern time it'll literally wipe human race, get record one results.

It's easy see ""historical pattern"" due puddle fallacy - still exist various pathogens tamed time. virus ever continuously evolved deadly contagious would eventually wipe everyone (or least significant enough portion genetically detrimental).

The problem mean can't happen, that's vaccines preventative measures important - there's 1/1million chance coronavirus mutates become deadly, less vaccinated individuals spread increases chances happening. Smallpox evolve less deadly, quarantined vaccined existence. southwestern Brazilian city Toledo, won’t find much vaccine skepticism. 98 percent eligible residents received least one dose Covid vaccine, according municipal officials.

Most received vaccine offered Pfizer, week drug maker said presented opportunity: Pfizer announced would fully vaccinate everyone city age 12 carry study safety effectiveness vaccine.

The company work local health officials, hospital, university Brazil’s national vaccination program monitor transmission coronavirus “real-life scenario” whole population vaccinated Pfizer-BioNTech serum, Pfizer said.

The study follow participants one year investigate long vaccine protection lasts Covid-19 new virus variants.

“Here believe science lament almost 600,000 deaths Covid-19 Brazil,” Mayor Beto Lunitti Toledo said announcing Pfizer study.

The study comes experimental inoculation almost every adult southeastern Brazilian town Serrana. experiment believed first mass trial kind entire town vaccinated coronavirus rest country.

The experiment Serrana conducted three months winter spring. Sinovac’s Covid-19 vaccine put test town 45,000. resounding success, steep drops new cases, hospitalizations deaths, time rest Brazil grip pandemic.

Brazil suffered one world’s highest death tolls pandemic. 600,000 people died Covid-19 Brazil, according New York Times database. Though many experts believe true death toll may higher, world’s second-highest death toll. 710,000 Americans died.

Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, ambivalent importance vaccines. Many Brazilians expressed anger slowly government acquired vaccines corruption scandal involving vaccine deals. usually true. variations statistical kind rule. could (and apparently did) easily become deadly. We, quite literally, pandemic absolute best time possible.
