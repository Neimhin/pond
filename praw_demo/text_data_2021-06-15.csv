0,2021-06-15," Speaking Pacific region, zero-covid strategy part, combined sloppy vaccine procurement lack clear exit plan. Reliance border closures permanent rather stop-gap measure. Yes, countries Asia Pacific somewhat open right now, look scenes US UK disbelief. ""Miles away finish line"" perfect way describe situation. Great Corona-AIDS nightmare fuel brain needed! actual fuck....I’m speechless. hope learned make vaccines fast. That’s silver lining see. Sure, false positives thing. immunosuppressed probably also means cytokine storm? 'shut everything' aggressive lockdown tactic combat highly contagious deadly novel viruses important early on. prevent virus finding safe harbor someone compromised immune system, prevent variants developing may harder combat escape wild. succeed containing virus early, replace years restrictions spent resources weeks worth preventative actions, quite possibly, smother pandemic sleep.  Google it.  Yep see flight tracker flight in/out India bringing world special gift.

Let's face it. learned zero Spanish flu, zero covid well. ( Unless count stock TP) Massachusetts average 105 past week. lot, 15 times amount. people testing positive Covid common cold throughout 2020? Bro got vaccine December like week two approved EUA I'm seeing people getting incentives get vaccine annoys me. got vaccine barely much known side effects potential adverse effects. 6100 dead Iowa. every day. Omg pls stop walked vaccination around 50 degrees person door said reading low register thermometer let anyway hot hell masks help Exponential growth. Takes build bam. March 2020 shutdowns. CoMiNG hOmE Canadian, going day trips Burlington miss pre-covid life. People amazing, beer food scene amazing really feels like people care community. surprise first state reach point. Good them, can't wait go back visit. mean long known Indian variant. really took long upgrade variant interest variant concern. Absurd difficult distinguish antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2, virus causes COVID-19, antibodies fight coronaviruses, including cause common cold. Researchers NIH CDC studies used multiple types tests minimize false positive results, experts say still possible 2019 positives infections coronaviruses pandemic strain.

So possible people...may common cold. Got it. least feel air face now. Whew... Vermont first state 80% residents chipped... Nice...


/s, know idiots gonna think I'm serious.  Yes world leaders are/have been, late game.
Perfect example started outbreak Wuhan. USA right idea (evac citizens) fell apart quickly landing. Also failed proactively control border access impacted regions. UK could like NZ, also asleep wheel. basically running mode ""reactive"" also known chickens heads removed.  People big mad can't enjoy Pisswasser without responsible adult time lol *covid-21

Fixed  Typhoid Mary's...? doctor - far it, fact. I've illnesses fucked after. something ravaging system like covid can, makes sense things would linger while. don’t want invalidate say it’s clear care health others, need also realistic. can’t shut businesses social life 100% effective vaccine 100% population receiving it, it’s never gunna happen. Ever. point it’s good enough life needs go on, costs shutdowns financially socially outweigh benefits whole. small number people continue get sick die, that’s life. Lets honest, there’s pretty good chance people unvaccinated choice, don’t say celebrate it, brought themselves. People die car accidents, cancer, drowning, etc everyday. Covid different point, it’s risk living world. Protect family see appropriate live life.  said, SARS-CoV-2 could escaped lab. still substantial evidence thing occurred. changes, deeply irresponsible claim ""more likely"" happened. Jon Stewart know. know. CDC, NIH, know. quite possible one China knows either.

Your criteria responsible discuss lab hypothesis likely never met. Trust asking good faith: dismissal?  J&amp;J Pfizer/BioNTech use new technologies harder manufacture traditional inactivated virus vaccines China uses. would probably possible produce scale. get coming from. course, dunking adults liking Disney around since long covid unfortunately. hell last year I'm glad we're normal now. 80% two doses?  would one best days life werent hot hell outside Found commenter Iowa. ever visited?     **Affiliation:** University Colorado, Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation 

**Study Title:** Impact Loneliness Decision-Making Risk-Taking COVID-19 Pandemic

**Study Description:** seeking adults participate research study impact relationships support decision-making risk-taking COVID-19. Participation take ~30 minutes involve online surveys computerized card game. Please access study computer. *You eligible ages 18-89 live United States.*

**Study Link:** 

**Disclaimer (ethical/legal):** study approved Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board (COMIRB)(#21-2554)

**End Date:** February 1st, 2022 don’t wanna guy... nasty flu like symptoms little week late February 2020. Doctor assumed flu didn’t test flu. Never able get antibody test. weird notion masks worn required there's reason keep one otherwise

That's always did. like breathe fresh air. hell wants wear mask longer necessary?    That’s actually even better. People lost trust CDC lost trust media. way, things may different. AstraZeneca may quite effective mRNA vaccines, still great vaccines far worst there. still great impact stopping spread saving lives.

Don't let perfection stand way progress. SARS-CoV-2 accumulates, average, 1 mutation every 2 infections. Another way looking it: SARS-CoV-2 virus end year ~24 mutations compared virus beginning year. surprised see figured surely already given label. also wanna know this. people country got Sinovac even half population fully vaccinated, still much cases (and even more) Based saw TN last month guys fucked. didn’t see one single mask anything whole time there, except airport. long vaccinated political statement won’t see true global security view covid-19 it’s variants. long ability produce vaccines remains, foresee future vaccines without, groups kept seperate. idk even CDC much mainstream media selling fear porn public 4 weeks first dose GTA (Pfizer)

Awesome! heard GTA accelerating second doses 28+ days. Congrats! NB something similar (they're opening second doses everyone next week). rest Canada wait 8 weeks. lack vaccines, imported enough Pfizer/BioNTech alone EU give first dose half population. top also vaccines like AstraZeneca currently using. limiting factor seems bureaucracy case.

That's nice see Japan donating doses. obviously using currently, donate surplus countries use instead letting doses get wasted. Thats nothing! Texas dropped everything less 50% vaccinated!  

/s research paper r/COVID19/comments/nsco00/symptomatic_acute_myocarditis_in_seven/ reported 7 teens rapid resolution symptoms.

This reminds controversial research reported 78% people suffered natural Covid infections myocarditis afterwards, closer inspection data, found lot signs myocarditis healthy controls. makes think signs cardiac inflammation common thing community researchers reason look them. 

This study said 49% participants myocarditis common cold infection. specifically looking chronic illness, long-hauler symptoms. basically looked ""did go doctor new medical complaint months year following covid."" last year become hotbed hating others like sort fun away house. 

It justified year ago. less so, stop. Opinions Opinions though, care less. I’d assume COVID-19 know first variant concern following mutation strain detected samples.

If consider Delta variant 70% transmissible (or something crazy like that), would huge difference Dec 2019 European strain Jan 2020 Wuhan strain 

The real question is, mean actual origin virus mentality entitled toddlers ...4% huge applied population.  Right. There's way know caused covid. percentage people covid went new medical complaint next months year (seriously, look list things included - ""general signs symptoms,"" gerd, skin issues, hearing loss, eye issues, whole kitchen sink included. Without knowing fraction people matched cohort people private insurance network went doctor new complaints time period, tells us basically nothing. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

… Hmm. Could also people vaccinated following virus want get back normal notice sub spits face ""listen science"" mantra last year scientists telling us activities safe.

I've done literally everything asked me, STILL can't get back normal because...reasons? 

I've done part I'm fully vaccinated, Disneyland complying state (who's guidelines MADE scientists)....but no, enough guess. 

Is shit like that's giving credibility ""just two weeks"" meme. mean - it’s pretty clear me

Full capacity Wimbledon final

Where confusion I’m missing Delta Variant, get  high uptake would presume something spoken about/had many papers on/studied depth. 

There potential carriers there. named *events* ""super-spreaders"", fact refer *people* capable carrying spreading virus large numbers people. One wonder... proud brave little state, people truly care take care Haven’t vaccine covid Yes actually soon paid via QR code server literally took apron left building puff smoke.

Speaking puffs smoke, I'd lay while. would get combination two different vaccines? get vaccine first second dose. 

Also, getting another type vaccine along J&amp;J J&amp;J vaccine requires one dose. Yeah, Times Square packed saturday. nice. Part educated state country. We're also least religious. one oldest. consistently low unemployment, too. different kind place (mostly) great way. fact, gave vaccines based official covid cases per capita, lot poor countries would getting even less are. Saying Europe North America hard hit covid directly falsifiable data hand. Looks like Sweden “natural” herd immunity migrated another place gonna find works Oh, I’m sorry! recently read thought right, even read “political”, since chinese, you’re probably right. Thank leaving comment friend Yep, San Fernando Valley hot balls today. Gonna long summer. forgetting CAN'T get vaccinations work. Yeah Im actually shocked 12-15 numbers UK clearly showed contagious variant contagious already Kent variant. 

What’s current data vaccine efficacy? saw something alarming low protection one dose can’t really understand spike protein still targeted vaccines  I’m getting double vaxed virus last year I’m worried. 14 top 20 countries total COVID cases per capita Europe North America. Based evidence have, actually fairly hard argue ""covid wide spread Europe North America"" argument. see what's happening UK right exponential growth finished vaccinating .

You could argue ""go cases now"", logistics setting new vaccination program, getting doses there, getting people appointments, compared speed covid outbreaks burn community, means really make sense.  Vermont reached 80% vaccination go bar? kind question that?? ANYONE go bar. Listen marginalize they're 'worthy' simple pleasure hanging bar friends. bar verifies vaccination, immunocompromised person knows odds 'herd' protection type environment exist bar. would also make people feel 'safer' general cater type clientele want attract. get vaccinated EVERYONE move feel safer it. True, making big, definitive statements get-go, rather practicing principle precaution admitting didn’t really know. 

One thing government agencies although lot good science used process making policy decisions recommendations public, ultimately government entity decisions made basis believe best serves public stakeholders, necessarily based scientific findings. example, made definitive remarks inefficacy masks early — wasn’t really based research findings, rather crucial need conserve N95 supply medical workers. 

This principle government agencies using science reach conclusions always basing decisions applicable pretty much every field too, medical. example, it’s extremely common natural resource conservation decisions research done ultimately basis subsequent policy. It’s 52 cases now.

Except maybe Victoria. Poor buggers didn't. they'll say did. like kristian andersen (scripps) said entire team sure new coronavirus many features meet evolutionary expectations, received 3 million bucks NIH, changed mind (within 4 days) called anyone questions origins virus crackpot. feel way! others noted, headline extremely misleading (and that’s generous description). Long Covid exists, pushing b.s figures cause many people dismiss actual data they’re told contradicting information repeatedly.

Journalists really suck sometimes. Yup right here. Plus allowing burn population likely result worse variants emerging. Uk minimum booking 8 weeks right now. plus side, thwre evidence longer gap gives better immunity. can’t give exact number you’ve Moderna Pfizer vaccine 95% less likely unvaccinated person get COVID. 

If unvaccinated people 100% chance getting COVID, vaccinated people would 5% chance getting it. course one 100% chance getting COVID. Even COVID running rampant year vaccines became widely distributed, [about Americans got COVID time estimated CDC. magically vaccinated start pandemic, odds getting COVID year would 5% one third 1.65%. 

But, vaccines natural immunity widespread, new active cases much lower months ago stay way. odds given person catching COVID America much lower you’re vaccinated, odds must well one percent. *San Francisco entered chat* Look list again. includes things like skin conditions (which could include, like, acne, rash, ""this mole looks kinda weird, better checked careful,"" etc.), gastrointestinal problems, migraines, mental health issues broadly, bunch common ailments problem believing roughly 20% population might see doctor course year. 

Maybe COVID regularly causes bunch long-term complications otherwise healthy people, maybe doesn't, idea-- think study pretty much fuck prove anything one way other. correct, idk got downvoted. found delta variant covid outbreak major port Shenzhen, China caused major shipping slowdown expected greater impact blockage Suez Canal earlier year. 

It’s big news shipping industry, China hasn’t reported many new cases lately, brand them. port managers Shenzhen took seriously enough slow operations crawl contain spread. buying new houses sight unseen way asking prices. I’m getting vaccinated brother tested positive twice first time sent hospital second (about 6 months later) cold. wanted point illness inconsistent part reason it’s dangerous school district (in Idaho) required masks students since returned spring break early April. Following CDC says, ""[experts yet know long protected getting sick recovering COVID-19. Even already recovered COVID-19, possible—although rare—that could infected virus causes COVID-19 Following ""Science (the journal)"" say, say that...""[About 95% subjects retained immune memory \~6 months ""Immunity (the journal)"" says ""[neutralizing antibodies remained detectable 5–7 months Overall, new research seems say people COVID immunity levels someone vaccine around 5-7 months even COVID cases pretty weak. rumors people receive Cansino second dose, since similar Sputnik second dose. probably good idea needs researched beforehand.

I know using first dose two times like Oxford one. Yes, two different doses better, twice better one. make sense. LA County alone reported 5 new deaths June 13, according LA Public Health Twitter account? Wow, old age groups REALLY impressive vaccinations. Hopefully country come close! Thanks. That's super crucial.   Foreign domestic terrorists  vaccines used US effective slightly leeway UK. people take responsibility actions? I'm really sure going this. Huh, interesting. Must fairly recent change procedure. Granted, doctor anything routine bloodwork several years  image newsom stage drawing minions, optimus prime, pair trolls, velociraptor danced front one highlights Yeah, comment mimicking conservative coworkers constantly complained 1- experts wrong 2- politicization pandemic (while politicized pandemic) 9/10 people life claiming covid covid believed widespread right leaning dismissive whole pandemic.  Half people subsequently got covid 100%. I'm also vermonter honestly say genuinely proud majority friends, coworkers, family, etc throughout whole process. people just... right thing. What’s problem? Looks like sense humor PSA’s. think government employees can’t possibly sense humor.  Chinese vaccine brand name Except Merck signed $1 billion+ contract US gov develop new drug combat COVID. story ivermectin dead. It’s getting interesting. california variant hasnt studied much cases pfizer vaccine 88% efficacy delta variant  Oh man don’t think it’s fearmongering aware variants. Full stop.

I think it’s fearmongering imply two doses mRNA vaccines anything extremely effective known variants, also think it’s fearmongering imply likely new variant come along soon render vaccines extremely effective. spike protein vaccines target latches cells. can’t change much still that. It’s like countries let get control giving virus gym membership. Like it’s getting stronger passes person person. No, it’s significant less likely kill you…..you could still catch it, likely wouldn’t bad case. Read breakthrough infections. Cases going recently - good sign well vaccinations happening. go see numbers country hole populations compare. UK 61% whole population first dose, vs 52% US. 

And 44% UK fully vaccinated vs 42% US. Arguing unlikely struck lightning meaningless unless source science behind that.  

Are assuming (or believe without good source information) chance small?   

Can back idea science-based sources? Hello, know correct sub question. feeling little bad suspect covid worries parents, received two corresponding vaccines medical history regarding respiratory diseases good, possibility parents get sick serious even two vaccinations? Greetings sorry English literally use google translator odds getting COVID vaccinated person fraction fraction percent. 

Do source data this? I'm 30 got vaccinated week ago. I've got two friends similar age got vaccinated 3 months ago. true opening people 18+ shortly, still quite 30 6/12 it’s 10,440. going continue talking ass? RSV spreading then, often tested for.  what’s endgame aren’t allowed mandate people get vaccinated? few, even need throw conspiracy theorist contaminating samples prove pet theory. offense you’re paranoid. afraid struck lightning go outside?  sure DV’d. happened kid January everything blew up. mystery illness. I’ve masking got vaccinated soon eligible. kid get vaccinated soon vaccine available.  Insistence? Pfizer vax protect California Delta versions effectively? original commenter asked (implied) whether people covid would immunity vaccine. Mr. lattehenanigans posted article addressed vaccinated t-cells, I’m assuming getting disease. seemed similar results protecting covid variants. 
I wanted know people downvoting, source misleading wrong, people idk wanted downvote Yikes Everyone making decision en masse becomes breeding ground new COVID variants could potentially put us back square one put undue strain health system. 

Also, enough people decide take vaccine, it'll suck resources ERs responsible people trying live lives might need get car accident something. Delta+?! paramedic. Hospitals overwhelmed December, January, February 2019 2020. I'm going say Covid cause, already shitty flu year. ER's packed. mid tour work NBA cancelled went busy shifts people calling 911 call volume dropping literally overnight  
I've medic 10 years point far one worst flu seasons. town work hit hard March 2020 due BioGen conference saw fair share covid cases early I've never seen illnesses present way covid did. don’t understand everybody brother “had weird thing must covid”

The flu particularly bad.

I remember mentioning awhile back people use term ""flu"" blanket word like sickness. think leads fundamental misunderstanding bad actual flu really is.

I got first time life years ago put completely commission days. Chills, miserable, fever, lightheaded, cotton mouth, etc. awful. governor Texas signed executive order forbidding state government institution (including public schools) requiring masks, effective week two ago (after schools let out). Cali recently day new deaths, bad. Certainly something watched it’s ripping swath death.  know lot people still refusing vaccine, seems like bad plan. AZ. Preliminary report UK India said AZ's efficacy infection delta variant dropped something like 60%. far, around 90 hospital staffs tested positive. hospital total 800 sth staffs, we're expecting blow more. Interestingly texts mate's received Pfizer specified invite. Yeah, article says partially fully vaccinated residents automatically entered previous two $50,000 drawings.   I'm open idea ignorant stereotype. Seriously, am.

But I'm assuming option groceries delivered home around people like us. specifically, homeless shelter communal living environment, seems dangerous terms COVID. bad, [an early said variant 18%-24% transmissible original strain, contrast, delta variant around 198% transmissible.

The [numbers dropped significantly since February, atm endemic northern california. can't personally see much relevance article/study comments replying could issue. Unless meant reply different comment ones linked to.  current rate we’ll hit early-mid November (at least one dose mean). would expect rate keep dropping though vaccine approved kids twelve might offset decline…. Really way know point. “total immunity“ including vaccinated people recovered COVID (but vaccinated) important IMO believe already 70% that. someone Ohio apologize behalf state person think need put energy ending species already. I’m tired living removed? title exactly NPR found unrelated post NAC recently banned think it’s reflection mental health crisis Covid created, people depressed/anxious people deliberately selfish. 

There similar reaction last Fall Offit said interview may mask/distance years regardless vaccine, flurry articles op-eds saying “get comfortable staying home till potentially 2024”. Source? people? including children can’t get vaccinated? California, mask mandates rolling shelter place orders, based county, today. Lmao love twistedly inspiring though!

It's time get back normal. going another mass wave. Keep restrictions limit spread virus. I'm glad see least people TN gotten vaccinated taken covid seriously. 

In Chattanooga, things basically back normal, means slightly open things covid...42% partially vaxed. hoped covid devastates unvaccinated choice. It’s both. didn’t apply *due to* political factors.

China hasn’t actually released details trials publicly like Western vaccines have, they’d need actually wanted approval Western countries.

Canada, UK, US, EU, etc aren’t willing take China word. positivity ratio 5% thats enough tests now.

Also, Religious gathering main cause second wave. main cause farmers protest reddit cheering on. second wave India started Punjab people gathered protests know bit, right? regards AstraZeneca, matter %. use Pfizer Moderna aswell. 
The much higher percentage people taken, take, vaccine make slight difference.

Don't surprised Delta variant hammers guys. (Fingers crossed doesn't) very, tiny minority, n95 masks solid protection. We're going stay locked forever protect people refuse help.

LIstEN SCienTiSTs Yeah think HIPPA shows little know love comment summarised ‘woah woah woah can’t know hospitalisation means it’s deadly .... it’s deadly’ 

Maintain consistency arguments! Lol Yep. We've afforded chance right thing day 1 someone walking around unmasked, social distancing, unvaccinated that's them. everything science told do, part rid society pandemic. I'm responsible choices others, want be. can't rule 100% specific topic studied meticulously specific vaccines. there's also nothing indicating there's issues far general population data. like binge drinking week rare. 

There's sorts vaccines there, occasional binge drinking depressed vaccination effectiveness significantly would general warning society avoid couple weeks purely based prior knowledge past vaccines.

I think safe assume there's issues.

The couple things would say start drinking first couple hours shot. Allergic reactions insanely rare common first couple hours, better wait out.

Also keep mind could end temporary side effects vaccine. pretty tired following day shot, lasted one day me. everyone gets side effects, everyone's different. get significant hangovers might something think about.   Australia New Zealand less dependant Tourism countries like Thailand/Vietnam/Cambodia/Philippines etc. 

So indeed, fare better. *A large U.K. trial involving nearly 10,000 patients showed administering REGEN-COV top usual care reduced risk dying fifth among hospitalized coronavirus patients hadn’t produced antibodies virus. drug effect among patients already produced antibodies.* I'm Texas county almost 50% least one dose 40% fully vaccinated. I'm sure we'll ever get 50% fully vaccinated, sure hope so. Tell it. cousin’s seven year old son got bad touch go hospital two weeks. still thinks it’s big deal. Showed immune suppressed mother’s house (she lives 50 miles away) unannounced mask, expecting able come visit. gave great reason vaccinate! ""IT WORKS"" No, there's enough people US fully vaccinated, enough vaccines still available eligible want them, start re-open get things back pre-pandemic. going happen overnight, definitely began process unpausing society. start point good time any.   waited minutes well sure, think case allergic reaction something, atleast around immediate help. not. ways people protect without requiring rest world shut cater them. sympathize people, society point resume vaccines going countries we're beginning point. Holy crap CDC slow. level concern variants, change anything? “Manaus thought first city reach herd immunity. second wave hit”

“A study published September 2020 researchers universities Oxford São Paulo estimated 76 per cent population infected coronavirus. avoided contagion remaining population could sustain another large true. state locked hard, even going far arresting people day unless could prove essential business. also mandatory 14 day quarantines visitors, enforced police.

I know got idea reacted like Texas. vaccinated dont need mask :/ Theres website like cvs proves vaccine. Fucking Vermont reasonable politics wealth equality.  Lol barely locked first place. Americans hilarious. FDA approval emergency use...means FDA approval.

All vaccines gone rigorous testing. ""For emergency use"" exists reason. We're exactly talking weight-loss supplement here. That’s fine restrictions lifted adults vaccinated. UK still live form restrictions sending vaccines abroad could use increase immunity level population rightfully riots. It’s frustrating living us , child vaccine age fills one anxiety , becsue anti vaxxers don’t give sht anyone still go without mask even though aren’t vaxed needs many outweigh needs few. Yes risk mutations.  mutation shown break vaccine protections major way would power consider taking steps back toward tighter precautions. prepare whining Well, CDC tracks states, I'm sure seeing it? Every thing I've seen both.

But reasons think. One is, adults likely get severely. that's there's huge push 18+, states nationally. mean kids can't get it, get severely, typically. That's hospitalizations deaths declining now. Also, 12 right (in US) can't get part. arent 30% cases delta variant UK added safe list ? fair, CDC labeled Delta ""variant concern"", article written, Delta list. I’m gonna lie, baseball game around gave $25 concessions vouchers getting J&amp;J shot, I’d double vaccinated. every state well Really? I'm interested information. News links? Reread said. say RNA vaccines. Perhaps written CDC declared delta variant concern? I’m positive though. I’ve seen headline thought week.

Edit: Actually seems yesterday. article written, statement could true, ie delta wasn’t voc yet. Im one paranoid Yes, was. cruise passengers required vaccinated. added edit explain further. encourage look research this. reopening continues obviously better research available. Remember six seven months vaccination program, already evidenced places. Like said edit, right skeptical far know theres evidence patient breakthrough infection (or reinfection matter) would somehow contagious.  stay plastic bubble let rest us live. Pfizer days nah, England one gave many single shot AZ No. Sorry, must mistaken virus denier. Seek validation elsewhere. Except Hungarian-American woman executive leader (senior VP) BioNtech. *actual inventor* mRNA technology executive leadership role developing covid vaccine. 

Whoever developed first rocket probably nothing Israeli activities........ Katalin Kariko opposite. 

Unrelated interesting note: daughter Olympic gold medalist also representing US. Wait me? I'm one spreading misinformation So, saying okay risk put others risk theme parks such? mean, places quite high-risk cruise ship might be. they're pretty damn close - especially many becoming fully unrestricted.

If vaccinated choice, need get head straight get vaccinated.

If vaccinated legitimate health condition, probably considering vacation options right anyway. could put cruise together. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Yeah hypochondriac (mild general, exacerbated pandemic pre-vaccination) really like little (Pfizer) updates. Since there's going 500 new variants whatever. bit disappointed saw ""700k"" record days ago(?), that's less average Germany around population

but looking better now, I'm glad gaining speed long least whole region gets back normality  Yes, confirmations always helpful. know often times, scientific studies lag public perception confirm already believed true, many us ask “didn’t already know this?” there’s difference “know” *know*.  Sounds like Bowser planning luring Peach D.C. kidnapping. They're going need extra medical staff equipment, can't contain huge spread, lawsuit happens.  certainly Governor's position - keep hospitals full capacity. goal get positivity rate go zero, fluctuate. increasing 14-day positivity rate BAD. going Iowa six weeks. Also, vaccination rate slowed 8,000 people/day. We're never going get 70%. One upsides pre-diabetic.   one addressing someone J&amp;J do.

Nothing. pretty simple. We're still point recommend everyone get vaccine (whichever one) stories even discussing like exist.

Like others said J&amp;J mentioned article. Pfizer first vaccine approved they're ahead curve media cycle. Moderna articles almost always follow afterwards J&amp;J. need one saying safe/effective go get MRNA.

Because there's need yet. Boosters vaccines still studied. look required anytime soon. plenty articles expert advice it. Exposure Notification Framework developed Google Apple retired point? distinctly remember reading Google Apple claiming ENF retired suitable point time, can't find mention anywhere searching it.  US headed way UK, EU also headed way, little bit later. Grammar police. Always cracks up. Epsilon variant Tajikistan appears, circus repeated. time serious, swear, COULD evade vaccines\* COULD contagious.

Since last couple weeks compliance seems dropped 99% 75% based anecdotal evidence. that’s south people general petty compliant regulations. evidence suggests viral load found vaccinated people low unlikely spread it. evidence still fully it’s looking good vaccines 100% effective lollll  entire cruise ship vaccinated passengers? that's dangerous idiotic statement make.   Honestly, I’m like slightly pissed got vaccinated early did. waited around got rewarded it. Instead got sticker smh.

I’m like half joking also it’s like kid always good kid sibling brat, mom promised sibling something good nice. Meanwhile moment would act got punished. 

Then wonder society entitled acts like spoiled children whines get way. It’s are. bunch, all. allow travel based EU guidelines people need travel those, change lot. Pretty sure read yesterday Pfizer AZ shots like 90-95% protection vArIanT cOnCeRn.  


Hate sound like tin foil hat honestly seems like media realizing shit almost done grasping air scare tactics keep clicks coming. Get 2nd done move ffs fiancé way. afraid fertility aspect it. Always wears mask, washes hands, even virus never went anywhere like going spread ever catches it. I'm vaccinated though hopefully precautions immunization we'll ok. EU gets mostly delta well, matter anymore. ""wtf"" realize UK almost three times daily new cases per capita USA *and* much higher share dangerous delta variant. know previous study mentioned 33% one dose I'm smart enough read see says same.

As someone who's almost 3 weeks Moderna first dose I'd like know much protection roughly right get second dose sometime next month so. Pfizer squad  *[citation needed]* Also early last year called saying Biden gets office sudden start downplaying Covid obviously shady… tune change especially California mind boggling. got something November early Dec year, coughing fever, cough WEEKS. horrible. think might Covid. say China questioned investigated keep messing virus I'm retired, I'm damn sure getting crowded situations unless to. Delta variant ain't getting me.  J/J one dose vaccine? get 2nd dose one. We're basically running large scale experiment infectious disease spread patterns. 

Will 30% vaccinated combined dropping protective measures combined contagious new variant lead large increase infections? not?

delta end world, real setback, needs discussed rationally.  government messaging show Moderna useful Pfizer? bravery short run rewarded peace mind long run. would think Germany would link health database like Belgium has... vaccinated political statement anywhere outside US, though? would guess supply keeping us vaccinating world right now, American anti-maskers agree.

It's piece cloth staying six feet apart.

It fucking hard. 

Y'all even wear gowns, gloves, face shields like healthcare workers. walk around ET gear day. looks like I'm headed space super hot. I’ve haven’t seen studies situations yet. you’ve fully vaccinated don’t need concerned. states US barely 30% fully vaccinated. wanting hear variant doesn’t make go away. parents fully vaccinated still hesitate go anywhere even full face shield mask, unless staying car. They're even terrified due Delta strain. would anyone 60 go tour bus right now... Underreporting deaths. That's tough one. believe current thinking that's roughly good two doses vaccine, I'm sure I've seen study confirming that. recipient Johnson Johnson vaccine, I'm concerned us one dose considered full vaccine course! usual, there's nothing stories speak left wondering we're protected not.  nah, there's tradeoffs, ownx, 'beatiful' numbers matter cuz made dubious circumstances, also, mrna vaccine could damagin way (more severe side stuff, immune overdrive blood clotting etc). brainwashed ccp govt, american articles Really frustrating - family Dublin seen since December. hoping Irish restrictions would ease opposite happening. Really fucking sucks. turnout problem, supply problem? Last year announced evidence covid-19 UK far back October 2019.

The case elderly Gentleman admitted Hospital October flu like symptoms, developed pneumonia unfortunately died December.

Obviously Doctors aware influzena influzena like virus. 

In February 2020 retested samples found covid-19.

They performed investigations questioning family friends order try find contracted covid-19. 

It transpired neither elderly Gentleman, family friends country significant amount time, spent significant time anybody overseas.

Nobody spent time Elderly Gentleman suffered type flu like symptoms.

Complete mystery acquired virus from.  us COVID-19 past got one booster vaccine dose that? Germany counts ""fully vaccinated"", I'd really like know implications Delta variant. B.1.1.7 got one booster dose AZ months later. Covid-19 binary ""you die"" ""you're 100% fine.""

Hospitalization, symptoms persist months, unknown future complications possible outcomes anyone age group. risks outcomes may lower children Delta variant, may same, may higher -- think enough data yet definitively say. they're 0. This. tired kind sensationalist bullshit.  bottomline people encouraged get vaccinated, vaccine type almost irrelevant, get done drastically improve odds avoiding serious COVID infection. know next nothing Vermont, even certain city state without looking up, gives positive impression place.

People parties , meeting friends like forgotten happened month ago . sad part majority lower class people uneducated here. like dont fear covid all. Im sick tired feel like booking ticket running away rest life smell, smell burning things constantly? first second dose suddenly loss smell, constantly smell car exhaust. happened 2-3 weeks strangely died got second dose. anti-vaxxers I'm thinking of. ones still fence lazy get it. no-vax coronavirus exists, get convinced anything.. EU digital certificate bullshit. get showing yellow vaccine card, [easily pharmacy doctor's office (there plenty quack doctors / pharmacists Germany probably check yellow vaccine card properly), get QR code, basically legitimizes fake vaccine certificate. Also, way revoke certificates, got faked QR code way revoke you. 

Probably real purpose QR codes shower pharmacies even money, get 18€ generate QR code, 24€ doses, digital-blockchain-bullshit-bingo solution, digital cool something.  allowed leave groceries essentials. Masks required. Outdoor exercise ALONE “pod” encouraged. I’m teacher taught home via computer last 3 months 2019/2020 school year. I’m TX. Everyone know even states much situation…where live?! this. Getting vaccinated way out. reach herd immunity anytime soon, either get vaccinated get virus.  Also, forgot India.

In this, admire EU.

in case, values much higher US level. Yeah, could go wrong! letting COVID run rampant country. Ohio, shelter place law. lot people pretty much stage sheltered place throughout country. People took upon right thing longer. lockdown Sweden, we've recommendations act.

Yep numbers show, compared similar countries like Finland restrictions stores events (amount visitors) restaurants (opening hours) they're getting looser minute we're getting vaccinated. Facemasks option.

please understand, misinformers try portray Sweden casualties took measures, thus everything useless.

Sweden relatively high casualty count take many measures. Propaganda would believe rule state wear face mask public transports rush hours (06:00-09:00 15:00-18:00) more.

What think important... rules adherence rules have?

Disciplined distancing powerful mandated masking places want mask.

People would flaunt Covid rules vaccinate use fictitious Sweden spread misinformation cause covid death. guess China one engaging vaccine diplomacy. 

The relative non player EU. spat UK otherwise really taking advantage others. US, China, Russia using vaccines buy favours mean media pumping stories variants keep fear mongering going. Enough enough. mean? already know vaccines respond variant according studies UK. still one locked regions world. Absolute madness 

Also one dumbest lockdowns world useless quarantines enforced 3 days loop holes circumvent it.

Quarantines lockdowns work almost airtight (see China, HK, NZ, Australia) First Amendment caselaw extremely clear religion cannot used excuse law applies generally everyone. political considerations may require states allow religious exemptions circumstances, nothing legally preventing removing religious exemptions vaccination requirements. Maybe fence, even then...and forget people already made mind they're type people death bed deny covid real. Sounded like needed hug. 


They don’t typically mutate specific way. happens case ones mutate become less severe observable long run. That’s trend you’re conflating ‘viruses typically become less severe’. It’s case ok... let correct ""...We restrictions gatherings, stores events (amount visitors)...""

I call ""lagom"" :) four-in-five would lie lying...

Seriously though, see could surprising. least people explicitly refusing get vaccinated. People fence might pushed get true believer vaccine evil (or whatever objection is) need travel obviously going least *try* lying unless credible penalties so. lockdown Sweden

What talking about? ‘friends’ couldn’t bother put mask keep us safe genius. They’re friends. We’re looking 90% uptake Canada, potentially, according surveys.

Basically boils message right? statistical anomaly. time though, spread virus statistical anomaly due level dispersal. Something like 5% individuals responsible something 90% spread (full disclosure: approximation -- remember exact number top head). tried highlighting dispersal early difficult people understand. try underscore rare accept happen. Either way truthful. 

But consider even developed countries could hit 100% vaccination, there's viable path also get done worldwide year. means eradication, thus dealing successive iterations spike mutations unvaccinated populations spread back vaccinated ones (or worse could level reservoir developed countries well get correct amount vaccination). means even vaccinated populations, see increasing amounts breakthrough cases, vaccine makers simply keep pace (which they've proven evenhandedly).

To problem emphasizing rarity incidence likely increase evolution virus, scientific discourse already discredited extensively public sphere. think better public health people perceive small risk real lead believe risk. really sad thing politicized -- esp.

600,000 unvaccinated Americans already died COVID, enough us left die move needle 100% effectiveness. put Lissabon risk list. :(

But vaccinating age 43 right hopefully trends soon....  that's intuitive way measure success vaccine rollout. 0% complete failure, 100% complete success. measured entire population, 0% complete failure, complete success somewhere around 85% (the percentage Americans 12 older).

If measuring much grass mowed, count grass planning mow, done 100%. Nah, underestimate kids. Well, OMT (expert advisory group COVID-19) members also advocated already, think. official advice OMT yet, come later week. seems like government already made choice ""they still want wait OMT advice"". two things course contradict other, nothing new government sadly. blame EU. delay Delta variant help whilst people get vaccinated. Wish we'd robust restrictions UK weeks ago, ship sailed 😥  course, could lower R, much much certainty?

If people wear masks indoors, bad cloth masks, lot wearing incorrectly, distancing correctly indoors, rules enforced lot outright wearing mask. Also, seated, even wear mask (e.g. cinema's). Sorry, put doubt effectiveness mask current circumstances rules. 

Last year mask mandate here, level cases low stayed low. Cases decreased rapidly, without mask, eventually rose again, also without masks. masks directly linked positive trend CoViD spread trend, least here.

It masks. wearing indoors (outside home course) since last year, still wearing mask. stand currently, big problem letting go mask mandate. Also, first point going happen anyways, even dumb. That's government likes do. Yeah, know two people covid long term symptoms. One chest pain, fainting spells. Since getting vaccine - less chest pain fainting. NYT article suggested vaccines help eliminate trace amounts virus may survived immune system, think. Many still resist. changed \~60% population vaccinated. That's enough, we're going see another surge fall. Didn’t UK mostly vaccinate Astra ? one ineffec variants ? Wasn’t D614G dominant trials even started? thought original Wuhan strain mostly overtaken late summer. still wear mine inside stores, supermarkets, Starbucks, etc. Texas 4% population immune compromised.

This number supports claim vaccines mandatory. 400 vaccinated Americans died problem companies mandating services employees.

Agreed right require almost anything, think they're wrong requiring COVID VACCINES. still high efficacy hospitalisation 1 dose (90+%) still good strategy what's great vaccines they're designed create antibodies spike protein. spike protein also allows covid infect cells. much covid mutates, fine line much really mutate spike protein changes much, potentially able get cells. variants continue infective, spike proteins changed much vaccines continue work them. would get covid vaccine parents would let ._. People took one shot two dose regimen, believe mean

Pfizer 2 dose = 88%

Pfizer one dose = 33% lotteries are, lot rebate programs people got vaccinated certain date. course happy hear that, situation UK daily infections increasing again? mainly concerning non-vaccinated people? hope assholes writing articles NY dead gone never return write follow-ups. Every one articles—and million April 2020–infuriated me. Man love cruises can't wait go back. one February 2020 narrowly averted crisis. also missed would first Alaska cruise supposed May 😭 thing first week Maryland. People still unsure. couple weeks later wearing masks stores. Moderna Novavax probably also provide boosters EU.  Imagine die get turned away Gawd says ""SHOULDA GOTTEN VAXXED 🤷‍♂️"" live dude, concerned safety. Hope you’re right! No. rise happening unvaccinated. DELTA PLUS ULTRA SSJ BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGON COVID

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE First I've heard Sinovac. compare J&amp;J? lot people opting one even America. get concern want clarify one thing: vaccines like high end security system keep virus entering body. Vaccines like dog…once thief inside thing push steal much things (aka get sick). getting others sick part isn’t confirmed using analogy - dog didn’t give thief chance get bearings likely won’t able run neighbor’s house rob too. viruses case though, longer he’s house multiplies robbers.

Without vaccine/dog: let thief ransack place sleep. Maybe hit neighbors too. Hopefully won’t kill you. yes won’t come back already took everything.

Now mentions nasal spray works acts like security system (stops virus entering together) that’s super new doubt many jump try that. Imagine ate trying find specific paragraph book. 

A good way remember words ctrlF document right? That’s basically vaccine does, teaches body words look find paragraph (the virus)

Now imagine you’re given different translation text (a variant). Obviously, translations, words changed, different synonyms used and, translation bad, whole sentences completely different even missing. happens, might happen words remember document all, might able find paragraph even memorized half it. 

The antibodies vaccine generates look specific sequences parts virus. variant suffers changes either change sequence structure antibodies looking for, might work well

Of course, oversimplification since immunology actual living hell, hope clarifies bit Everyone 2 doses UK. extended gap 8 weeks 12 weeks. 5g never better Well don’t go international cruise unvaccinated kids then?? rare reinfections? vaccinated natural immunity I’m sure bad it’ll get Transit federal, stay place. ....sooo bout Moderna one?  assume everything Pfizer Moderna too. study based original strain variants Pfizer similar results. Meanwhile Lisbon going exponential again, doubling time much 1 week. sure driving this, worrying. 
I think masking little impact Netherlands. don’t think work, it’s people visiting like crazy whole winter official numbers governments shows visiting friends family one top sources infection. 

My neighborhood never lively last 12 months.  Old article 4% population immune compromised. 

 would hope people care enough fellow Americans get vaccinated reason alone. problem companies mandating services employees. Whether government mandate different issue. Baltimore City announced mask mandate end July 1st. Also statewide restrictions end, exception federal transportation mask mandate date. Good. wouldn’t want someone isn’t vaccinated taking care elderly mother nursing home. Yes, original strain, similar Pfizer. sake animals hope variant successful. agree they're 100% effective preventing death (rounded nearest whole number), calculation calculate efficacy.

Efficacy vaccine (at preventing metric, death) calculated comparing portion vaccinated vs control individuals end outcome. fool, delta plus double secret lock probation whole time!  need 200MM doses. Ooh let's get norovirus mRNA vaccine race variants articles say vaccines protect variants always takes forever get everyone new thing. Many resisted. improvement seems prevail. Compare today March April 2020. different world things got better. basing public health guidance based polls people want instead science leads great outcomes. /s pandemic taught us nothing. side effects unlikely obvious. Many people experience nothing rest day two feeling sick. always power side effects keep going work whatever.

And even unlikely case become obvious, keep denying. must sick. No, get vaccine, would never that. Maybe make doctor's appointment ""illness"" cancel feeling better, even go tell doctor used cover; they'll fine it. got Moderna shots probably still reasonably well protected yourself. probably protected need hospitalisation, somehow get infected. may (or may not) still fall ill week able infect others, symptoms not.

Just keep wearing mask doubt, over. Probably get third shot whatever, possibly next year. Trial participants weren’t asked refrain, so, likely effect. still lot lowering R significantly. Source? Facebook /s does, even wear lowers R buying time fully vaccinate people.  Iraq WMD, questioning FACT option, need find sources back up, real fake matter.  EU also requested data Sputnik, still data submitted. Let’s assign cruise ship line unvaccinated, then. 

The vulnerable can’t get due health immunocompromised issues provable wouldn’t cruise regardless. Perhaps special policy vaccinated cruise, tested negative within 24 hours departure. vaccinated norovirus *much* bigger concern COVID, I'd say good old days back Americans mRNA vaccines. point UK stop bothering genomic sequencing.

Statistically vaccine effective preventing death, regardless scientists' ability detect antibodies. often can’t really numbers tests. example Germany performs lot rapid antigen tests counted official test statistics (only PCR tests are). I'm glad! fortune receiving Pfizer (first dose far).

I hope Sinovac shows similar results, since that's elderly aunt got. Boosters definetly necessary future deadlt variants emerge.

I family England soon second child. seen parents 2 years, can't go see now, spike christmas, even though state (RI) OK interms vaccinations, likely able go without lengthy quarantine, doable. may go alone.

Then there's stress hospitals. threat variants, primed better escape vaccines, doing, slowly increasing number. threat immunocompromised elderly, even vaccinated.

We live society. consequences end doorstep logic helped US fucking abysmal throughout pandemic, absolutely hurt us vaccinations too.

Our uptake fucking laughable. embarrassment. fuck cares anymore? next one called ""Delta Ultra+"". I'd actually saw someone take mask order sneeze Home Depot presumably want get mask wet. nice able read articles without registering email creating account. large portion cited “10 years” develop vaccines research, safety efficacy trials. mRNA vaccines development 10 years, viral vector vaccines like AZ use since 1970’s Cuz mRNA vaccine target whole spike protein? virus mutates point aren’t effective won’t really able infect humans well, putting path ending existence. argue issues mother, take general issue antivaxxers, related otherwise. patience people prolonging deadliest pandemic century.

Instead train immune even better much better off. general vaccines offer uniform long lasting protection post-infection immunity. Well, sounds like emotional issues mother spilling affecting people online.

Not much point continuing this. hope get issues. What’s next madness? Delta Plus Ultra? Like Hero Academia? state still requires masks indoor workplaces Cal OSHA decides align state department public health. also still required public transit ride shares. workplace mandate might change soon still see lot masks public--including workplace-- people way work going store lunch break going hassle taking masks on.

Also, vaccines approved November, 8 months ago, tens thousands trial participants started months that. people basing personal health choices someone insulting internet, they're someone could ever help. seems protection COVID-19 due density great.

I'm amazed sub still harping population density. primarily social behavior drives infections. People Iowa still go bars, churches, hang other. reason why, covid vaccines thing yet, younger people testing positive elderly. Younger people really care elderly diligent social distancing. virtually vaccines history side effects beyond 6-8 months. seems significant difference effectiveness doses one two mRNA vaccines well preventing Delta variant, leading concerns another Delta-driven wave cases places ease measures soon based first-dose metrics alone. point you’re probably pushing people vaccine hesitancy. 2nd Pfizer shot first -- sore arm, touch malaise fatigue (sleepiness). 2 days. fever.  Looks like Time Traveller.

Definitely case here. I'd expecting least 85% hit wall. Younger adults would've started vaccinated point, definitely increase more. Pick 4 month period want numbers still hold up.

You're trying show I'm wrong showed part math, numbers stark that's need see.

It's belligerent. I'm right, know I'm right, know can't prove wrong, yet still grasping straws trying win tiny portion debate.

The mRNA vaccines 100% effective preventing death number need see know 400/150,000,00. Everything else common knowledge point lived it. Nobody forgot COVID started access vaccine. Serious question: point stop calling COVID pandemic, even disease continues spread heavily areas? doubt anything said. plenty people long lasting issues. 25% stat study junk. scientific all.  areas less densely populated areas 

The Dakotas least densely populated states country one worst hit regions country. Population density matter much people still socialize gather. People still going churches, schools, groceries, bars South Dakota regardless density. 

If delta variant hits US (which likely) rural areas quite bad. coastal urban area (which high vaccination rates high 60s 70s even higher), much safer. Thank you. hard everyone's first reaction ""well brought vaccinated."" hear that, planning to, he'd gotten promotion work workload insane kept putting afford take time (in case reaction got sick days - likely due underlying health conditions). incredibly careful throughout last year half, restrictions easing thought things safer could get little longer got vaccinated. one people often put job personal needs, might killed him. caught Covid coworker. 

*That's* I'm telling people careful, think restrictions easing lulled false sense security. might feel like jumping jacks due sore arm touch fatigue, could likely pass side effects saying stayed late.

And although OCD would imagine would actually help quite bit get vaccine. Since wife got second shots I've massive sense relief pandemic general (well, especially parents got shots, too). live Iowa I'm 16 Depending live old might able to, especially adult go you. don’t disagree. approach whatever say caution skepticism anymore. Thanks! That's interesting. 

Though 95% confidence levels Delta variant huge. 53% range 1 dose pfizer's efficacy regarding hospitalization, example (46%-99%). Looks like need data. enormous, evidence-based document advice tackling vaccine hesitancy. recommends listening counter-claims calmly &amp; without hostility.

It doesn’t say tell person get married, implying stupid, ridiculous things. 

Even evidence didn’t say otherwise, think rude, patronising smug way win people over?  Moderna gang  it’s good CDC bad it? There's known correlation side effect severity resulting protection. got vaccine, good go. bright side, knowing typical vaccine side effects kind proof got vaccine placebo. :) Manhattan still reasonably high places like shops, interesting since vast majority people dropped outside soon getting green light. interested Cuomo essentially declaring victory yesterday speeds process. you’re sure. dude tried move goalposts, I'm convinced word pre-edit, even saw word using previously. you’re taking idiom literally simply contrary. PHE declared VOC May 7 May 11, according [the Wikipedia Delta variant. virus still killing hundreds people daily, nearly unvaccinated

If sort simple solution problem. unfortunately lot messaging coming CDC highly politicized best scientists world work organization great source new research emerging information. incredibly disappointing messaging heavily politicized therefore recommendations definitely scrutinized critical thinking far scientific research goes typically top notch Ya it’s bad reason. Poor critical thinking. Yep! still new cases daily Ohio. know person came from. Re-infection deaths side effects vaccines exceedingly rare. Vaccines increases chances getting Black Fungus, White Fungus, Green Fungus, Cream Fungus.

...is definitely true. 2.3 billion vaccine shots administered globally. billion one thousand millions. That’s two thousand three hundred millions people. 1 every thousand people medical anomaly vaccine, would millions reported potential reactions may coincidence necessarily causally related. fact matter vaccines thousands peoples arms since mid last year, early phase trial subjects still monitored. vaccines statistically unsafe would know now. others risk cruising.

Who putting risk? mRNA vaccine 100% effective preventing death practical purposes also 100% effecrive preventing severe symptoms.

If someone chooses get vaccinated they're ones taking risk, us vaccinated.

All adult Americans opportunity vaccinated, countries want limit access ports responsibility. sure hope you’re actually nurse   I'm Nova Scotia we've crushed third wave (97 active cases) 67% one doses.

The end near. pls share source points summarized? shot chris Paul get? it

It referring sentence: ""It is"" direct reply calculation calculate **efficacy.** Cool, reason give shit anything anymore? Climate catastrophes incoming, virus going choke death, money anywhere, wealth hoarded dinosaurs, end world know feel fine :) disagree OP? da virus variant? offered least 100 fidget spinners week Rome.  bit stretch call good. 400 people died X months average infection level average overall IFR Z due certain level knowledge/treament disease.

Meanwhile 600,000 died P months average infection level Q, average IFR R due certain level knowledge/treament diseas.

But, hey, gives shit X,Y, Z massively different P, Q, R? Right? plop 400 right 600,000 say ""get educated, I'm talking effectiveness"" call good.

Yep, known better. belligerent are. vaccinating global pandemic that's killed millions people. also got JnJ offered day facility scheduled for. Initially happy get anything, new variants slow vaccine rate amongst country making wonder exact thing. called CDC got call back nurse said getting Pfizer Moderna necessary, months ago point Delta identified. thinking may call call doctor. They’re ones mentioning faith, response bulleted list facts.

No one pushing blind trust CDC agency thread.  That's exactly point, reasons makes sense hold off. Notice saying reasons get vaccine period, risk getting vaccine case higher waiting conclusive evidence. malpractice issue result Dr claiming risks outweigh benefits. claim higher risk covid vaccine proven. Studies one thing, anyone thinks 9 months long enough track record, fooling yourself. Hopefully covid vaccine safest vaccine ever created, wait proven actual practice rather lab. I’m they’re shipping people province due ICU bed shortages  logical antecedent

Don't put words mouth, meant exactly said exactly said it. Malone invent mRNA tech. Plus league resources this, investing testing cheaper blowing playoff matches due covid spread. Viruses tend mutate become less deadly, transmissible. It’s possible mutation become deadly, unlikely. virus’s goal spread, kill. Killing actually makes harder virus. efficacy approved.

Personally hope wearing mask indoor public places remains requirement time country. many people still vaccinated lack vaccines. think scrap face mask rule everyone chance get vaccinated before. disappointing make realise lucky been, first big contender really fail final hurdle, every vaccine produced fantastic results - really lucky, clearly worst timeline pandemic that’s sure Pfizer approved stored fridge whole month, far longer typical storage time mass vaccinating. news vaccine mixes boosters?

I got Johnson &amp; Johnson April. option, would love get mRNA booster full course. 

There Bloomberg article various pharmaceutical executives already mixing vaccines, information research done direction? I'm worried, would prefer supported.

Nothing stated quote asymptomatic versus symptomatic.   lab leak theory necessitate conspiracy Yeah fuck getting vaccination appointments certain countries still ongoing vaccine shortages. mean, isolated pocket bad, majority country limited restrictions, new cases starting slow increase, vaccinations still progressing quickly, hospitalisations younger likely survive, NHS dosen't look like overwhelmed anytime soon.

Sure, kids likely die covid, yesterday NY Times article long term symptoms fifth people asymptomatic cases, including children. risk seems high enough wearing mask get vaccine seems completely reasonable me. think people hesitant stupidity well? I’m inclined agree.  dont think everyone whos hesitant ignorance Hahaha sub's safe space type drying up. find next thing exaggerate / outraged about. obviously “medical conditions” would prevent getting vaccinated anyway. saw British variant. cases go down, variant goes up. point cases general rise too. 

Good news vaccines give good protections mostly trouble people vaccine. never got side effects either shot it’s given you’ll feel like crap. husband got chills second shot son totally fine never would know got shots. Seriously it’s nothing promise. won’t even feel go in. maybe sore muscle got promise it’s millisecond. wake like 9 month sleep?? It’s trial. wild world sports?!?!? Reading threads anti-vax anti-mask people, I’m pretty sure there’s large enough population US problem, especially kids unvaccinated. Pfizer distributer/manufacturer. It’s BioNtechs vaccine, invented it. J&amp;Js slogan ""You're probably fine!"" seems attitude studies seem taking it. British study — part wider Recovery trial investigating various possible treatments people hospitalized coronavirus — found antibody combination made Regeneron reduces risk death given patients severe Covid mounted natural antibody response own.

Makes wonder given Trump.  news isn’t causing us perceive uneducated fool, you’re own. Another?! realize found any. lose many people one year life saving treatment? Good Welcome, son. need actually promise full reopening vaccination stick promise.  painless vaccine I've ever gotten. barely noticeable. this! put restrictions place people refuse vaccine? Let's get kids vaccinated done it. Invalid argument. vaccine available anyone wants it. need force masks anymore. go mask-free, threat anyone. normal person Good morning,

Any new info J&amp;J real world effectiveness? Any. Thing. At. All? Yup. beginning serious coordinated tracking quarantine. global level. 

Could slowed spread lot. would eventually got hand perhaps could year headstart avoided complete shutdowns. use Greek alphabet? housing shortage no.  used word ""restrictions"". Oh minor, let's keep going forever. argument end it. argument? Keep it? Why?  J&amp;J even understand release information??? China tag 4mil free. Everyone vaccine diplomacy, right thing do. Shame connected states not?

States making choices like make sense, entire opening plans.....

Unless closing boarders solve nothing overall. Absolutely none restrictions “lockdown.” Getting really tired people dramatically overstating minor protective measures. Oh utterly ridiculous.

SK successfully dealing Covid - failed abysmally. learn them, instead making snide comments necessary measures taking.

I'm sure glad adjust 'normal' many people *actually dying*. replace ""vaccine-hesitant"" ""ignorant morons"" point? Start calling people are. Yep, I’ve got couple hesitant friends want give another month 2. 

I don’t quite understand why, least plan getting it. Good news! spike, retrospective, may good thing get people get vaccinated. aye. Good luck them! Lol Sweden actually performed better many European countries harsh restrictions. ISNT TRIAL. ffs wrong people.  British people funny though. survey vaccine deniers showed majority get vaccine end.

We piss moan told Remember certain US president holding rallies events peak virus? Geniuses abound. First jab fine, arm hurt bit rash could something else. Honestly second jab fun. felt like ass 36 hours, 36. mild cases COVID like week more? shot side effects nothing near even mold case rona. 
Moral story shot hurt going in. side effects first mild almost dont notice second basicly meant crappy weekend. like flu shot x 3 4 5 would lie survey result Russia dropping restrictions little 10 % population vaccinated. live Texas, everything open behaving everything normal.

Although ""chronic fatigue"" bit melodramatic. Even rare cases ""long covid"" kids, clears eventually almost without fail, especially healthy kids. I've tracking Iowa numbers since Feb 2020. decline positivity rate week. 81 cases 2,861 tests 2.8% positivity damn high. Iowa 1.9% 14-day positivity rate. lot worried about. looks like astrazeneca actually recommends 8 12 week gap. case, long going less 8 weeks, totally fine. Less window time may fine too, I'm assuming trials looked 8 12 week gap, that's timeframe much data exists far. Yep didn’t criticise suggesting - held comment one standard (I.e. needs data) never said anything needing data comment (less deadly)  earth US “lockdowns” point? even protesting? vaccines available everyone. Stats obviously high people aren’t dying. Amirite NY state ? 2 weeks positive test truly long enough contagious? tested positive 3rd isolated 10 days return work 11th. Symptoms cleared fevers. hyper paranoid getting loved ones sick. ok intimate partner around family 14 days later get retested first?   click-bait. one stat indicating rapidly increasing, new variant `10% cases now`. corresponding video shows stats like US '30-40% 14 day averages new cases'. Well Switzerland then.

In CH, took emails got vaccine, recieved confirmation asking want part COVID pass (including code confirm registration web portal). 

We receive pass used QR code.

So no, Switzerland, it'd extremely hard fake it. search true efficacy, vaccines placed testing conditions. far know werent test compare them. Ok , gap doses decreases? good bad individual? people vaccinated protected this?  vulnerable vaccinated risk low. case throughout Europe, yes many places low vaccine supply.   I’ve helped bring back employees/students Korea definitely difficulty adjusting back normal, even something like class without masks quite jarring you’ve dealing year.    Agreed. never understand adults unwilling wear masks little longer protect children. Well. We’ll know it’s cluster transmission.  Thanks, cake day April Yep, dad fall 2019, ended walking pneumonia. probably would also convinced covid hadn’t tested positive flu.

Hopefully amazing advancements come last shitty year. fair, world thrown enormous amounts money towards HIV problem past four decades, resulted amazing drugs could basically stop whole thing everyone infected them. Also important note HIV research added greatly immunology research, ultimately helped us get COVID vaccine fast.

The next couple decades looking pretty damn great HIV front. [The CDC listed half dozen variants site.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Happy cake day! Hi. Covid. left fucked up, too.

I also got vaccinated. 

Vaccination nearly 100% effective preventing death unlikely occur catch it. 170 million people, 60 died Covid vaccination.

I understand hesitancy safer Covid It’s always people know nothing HIPAA wanna claim HIPAA violations lmao Cali seen Venice, Hollywood Blvd. Sanfrancisco first hand F.O.! Lol, houses? We've shortage years. Still hasn’t happened despite weekend reporting, so…  Holy shit didn’t realize UK numbers high sub devolved trolls spreading misinformation new strategy: constantly suppress voice concern tell “fearmongering” anything isn’t good news. 

It’s new flavor anti-vaxx/mask misinformation trolling, time new twist that’s even psychologically manipulative, WANT over. 

Stay vigilant there, folks!  Thank much civil discussion respecting other’s opinions. 

Seriously, lot people truly agree disagree. nice concept. 👍 That's rate Massachusetts, correcting population. (We 10x many people.) ridiculous. Like Bill Gates' mission destroy malaria entirely, start global mission destroy HIV entirely.  motto ""Freedom Unity"" one main reasons pharma companies often run trials South Africa, see well treatments work people HIV. Every Monday like that, fact happened since March 2020 still notable.  nope. theres heatwave across pretty much entire western u.s. minus coastal areas permanently good weather context? cares live free die trying Honestly, don’t know anything would changed. Nobody took seriously hospitals started filling up. Maybe could started making/procuring PPE sooner. Wrong wrong wrong. take never known immunocompromised person else make ignorant statement. get sick bring school then?

Their parents responsible taking theme park packed full potentially contagious individuals sending school soon after. irresponsible ones, follow CDC guidance. went check there's population difference, they're pretty comparable, especially consider north qld clustered 3 high density areas making empty space functionality irrelevant. Headline makes sound like things related. completely separate sporting events. hell distance states matter? virus unable travel vehicles reality? Los Angeles too? Reopening day coincide heat wave lol. I’m keeping air-conditioned home time lot better nothing still far good vaccines.

If everyone vaccinated it, sure, enough herd immunity. still need many vaccinations compared use e.g. Pfizer/BioNTech instead.

With said, wish best luck OP's mum. provinces, scheduled 105-120 days later (or least people). send link reschedule there's supply move second dose (currently, 8 weeks later). Sorry obvious, RSV? here. Well, keep mind people *didn't* covid-like thing back (the vast majority people) talking it.  next boarder Vermont. ""Vermon"". Lol. UK good access vaccines time also really great uptake You’re hard please, aren’t ya?  Headline bit misleading. specifically look ""long lasting symptoms."" looked new medical complaint months following covid (would ranged 1 12 months depending covid) broad array categories. look whether conditions ""lasting,"" determined many cases caused covid. Without matched-cohort control group, say ""25% covid patients including 19% asymptomatic people sort medical complaint following months year."" Yet somehow deaths thing matters politicians 🤦‍♀️ Pretty much - virus' mutation reproduces makes different enough original strain, new variant I’m Pfizer it’s good stats share friends. Stay safe &amp; healthy, everyone. feel like lot credibility institutions like CDC ideal. can’t blame people this. least US, responses government (local federal) CDC mediocre best abysmal worst. people charge people’s trust needed failed. Now, something new arises, nobody going care CDC government already fucked much, makes different. Now, isn’t good thing level trust people charge constituents unfortunately, trust must built back up, takes time. 

As variant, I’ll willing bet end similar UK variant we’ll find vaccines work it. However, scientist way trying optimistic here. I'm little disappointed Germany. Germany prides good recordkeeping. Germany lining everyone streets pumping vaccines millions time? *You know are* 1) bringing unvaccinated child Disneyland right now...

2) 1. immune compromised...stay home really really vigilant. Personal responsibility important ifnyoure compromised, kids.

3) exact type place I'd like see vaccination verification system mitigate this. can't force vaccines apply social pressure. Using restaurants bars may ridiculously unhelpful based it, large places like can't hard.

4) nearly 50% country 300+ million ton landmass fully vaccinated. seems nations lower vaccination numbers pose biggest threat variants. we're truly worried maybe shutdown international travel first, right? Beyond that, want keep shit closed want avoid variants, we'll literally years...no one stomach that, thank god... Meh, people moving much higher numbers pandemic. We're running housing, available least 25% higher cost last year, need state money afford it... find it. messaging 1 year [**2022-06-15 23:18:39 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2022-06-15%2023:18:39%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

I’m sure around you’ll still screaming like misinterpreted Mayan calendar.  much easier keep track calling ""India strain"", ""London strain"", etc. ""alpha"", ""beta"", ""gamma""... flu really bad 2019-2020. two waves (flu B hit hard Oct/Nov, flu Dec/Jan/Feb, midwest state). best times flu tests run (antigen) catch 50-70% flu positive cases. They're accurate tests. totally believable someone tests negative flu, actually it. see much diagnose flu based symptoms time. Like time, every single day acute care clinic. possible send PCR flu test there's need people, change care plan unless need hospitalization. 

If covid damned widespread Nov/Dec/Jan people want believe, would seen 1) hospitalization rates, 2) increased deaths, 3) care homes. Covid pneumonia *totally different appearance* normal pneumonia see first covid pneumonia xray May 2021. definitely helps. also aren’t major cities. It’s still incredibly low per capita though Instead I'm state talks loving thy neighbor even hit 40% (fully) vaxxed yet.

Tennessee, curious. you’re still around.... get flooded state cars/license plates certain touristy towns weekends/holidays. That’s tell lives doesn’t quick read, used infected patient, low effect early stage, overused cause lead poisining.  problem people want us vaccinated people take said mask. It’s cutting little close. Officially, there’s five day window breakthrough symptoms would generally appear. Personally, I’d feel okay still feeling well, would reschedule feel sniffly symptoms. risk isn’t zero, low. Judge comfort level. forgot asterisk: *a pandemic controlled California. quickly sort thing scaled. 

Say, example, got approved today, long it’s readily available globally. way vaccines did, start stockpiling doses final approval ready go? booze. 

I'd ride Pirates Caribbean rum based drink literally day. Sure wish knew answer that. wish way make stop. people irredeemably sociopathic. Anyone found guilty something like auto death penalty. love shit year going forget thing moved another new batshit theory like 2012 end worlders we're moving lives. free market doesn’t exist. Even regulations, wouldn’t exist. 

There ton reasons why, fact time exists, economy moves faster market could ever reasonably make decision, simplest reason. 

There free market principles cool. don’t work outside heavily regulated playing field isn’t even close we’d consider free. state dropped restrictions back early March. Right vaccine came think. Possibly. see people already trying figure get one. Fauci taking better line here, though. question much still open. Yeah that's... good sign, delayed bad sign scary. jaw dropped. Like can't even imagine this. Unrealistic expectations lead disappointment think eliminate Covid time soon 

1) really it’s parent, you, always though (like myself) cannot vaccine, going throw society expect wear forever? going happen 

2) point, even though chance extremely unlikely still happen, live around 95% vaccinated (ish?) current cases vaccinated individuals

3) like said nothing 100%, cannot expect people wear mask forever (possibly) eliminate Covid, that’s realistic chance anyone long 

There point say “good enough” pushing goalpost backwards  Lymphocytic leukemia means cancer type white blood cells called lymphocytes. lot important immune cells lymphocytes, including ones form memory illness. Since lymphocytes abnormal, they’re unable that. That’s one conditions cause vaccines work. sucks. hope he’ll okay. like 90% anything came covid bad. 

If sacrifice 10% good go back pre-covid, net win me.

Places still wanting seasonal temperature checks. absolutely insane. coming you, vaccine - good luck getting 15,000 daily death number from? Post text. Temperature checks walk Safeway is, fact, hygiene threater. Minnesotan, I'll say I'm jealous. We're usually top winning participation races. Good job, Vermont. put rest us shame. effectively worthless information without knowing many mutations average person COVID develops. Meanwhile state hasn’t COVID restrictions year, government preferring leave local governments. today signed bill allows local governments ability make decisions 30 days 6- 12-month period public health crisis.  near enough 100% effective preventing severe hospitalisation death.

That’s care really. 1% efficacy wants, provided protect severe complications. turn COVID cold that’s job done. morons NNN big surprise lmao know main reason they're cut server hours, covid ""protection"" right? brain-dead job, e.g. … Trump guy recently? know missed word ""hospitalization"" OP, sure heck lol. Thank kindly clearing things :) Hindsight? Lol Nope. June 15th, mood overwhelmingly positive reopening based metrics showing vaccines working well.

This second time predictions reopening failed come true. probably stop making them. assume drug companies put massively conservative expiry dates make absolutely, categorically, 100% sure never give expired doses. Probably factor 2-3x put safety. 

They’ll absolutely fine. Soon though. Looks like we'll get safety trial data 5-11 year olds back Sept, 2-5 year olds Oct / Nov. agree. kid mystery fever tested negative flu, won’t say covid. one else orbit caught it. something, covid? Nah. one thing , WTF? HIV still ravaging Sub-Saharan Africa. [71% people HIV live Sub-Saharan area question, province South Africa population 11M. HIV prevalence I'll grant know Novavax does, Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson &amp; Johnson sure. mRNA vaccines delivering signal body's cells make spike protein, two deliver spike protein adenovirus. restrictions lifted state level, local jurisdictions still whatever want. seems totally reasonable. you’re medically unsuitable jab genuine reason you’re exempted. people possibly impact anti-vaxxers. looks like won’t kick everyone offered course jabs anyway.

We already make healthcare workers jabs starting work hospitals. Airline crew need going certain parts world. Yellow fever vaccination certificates exist. They’re pragmatic solutions genuine problems, different. Must nice living state people right thing care fellow man. Congratulations Vermont  informed virus world hadnt seen before? Amateurs FYI, likelihood getting downvoted know talking about. offered AZ instead Pfizer, would definitely still take it. fact, choice, I'd prefer AZ followed pfizer given promising results coming trials. end day, matter much; matters getting vaccinated. see. Thnx. thing science provide information receive study it, novel virus better taking extreme precautions first able understand virus better able make education decisions. messages changed able use scientific method make accurate information available studies get completed. 

This pretty standard science especially medical field. White countries.

That's meant (read comments). meant ""safe countries""/""whitelisted countries"". Check research around vaccine helping long haulers quite interesting. myocarditis happening young men 30 extremely rare well. explain like I'm five explanation article says man immunocompromised due chronic lymphocytic leukemia. means blood cancer condition makes hard body make antibodies protect infection. Yeah dangerous scientific observations leading increased stigma. know 20+ people got insanely sick weeks January 2020 attending live show. ones frequently talk to, one us ever got covid pandemic really bad flu strain circulating people never got COVID plausible explanation early COVID.

Agreed. know something going around Orlando Feb least one coworker contracted. seemed way flu-like Covid-like terms duration symptoms. vaccinated flu recall reading vaccine effective year. NY well, although I'm entirely sure % rate is. surprised good is. rural SoCal gas station, staff asked someone leave wear mask. great.  sister got literally days put ""pause"" April. risk group blood clots, even recently pregnant, problems major symptoms either. Context doesn’t matter cares! went grocery store LA 95% wearing masks, Starbucks 100% wearing masks. vaccines 33% effective **symptomatic disease** Delta 3 weeks first dose. data effectiveness **against hospitalisation**. Hope clears things :) mean nationally internationally, Florida. Bad translation Hebrew?

Whenever see top comments scientific papers sub, predictable gonna be. Anything that's positive news ""Awesome news"" ""I love this!!!"" without single hint skepticism (and justifiably great news!). anything that's even slightly negative everyone says ""this study flawed"" ""that's enough evidence"", ""this fearmongering"".

TX--lots school districts already declared masks required (but discouraged). fact state Memorial Day spike probably lead people feeling comfortable venturing out. take global view covid. US things seem getting much better, UK good, final restrictions yet due delta varient spreading.  
This keep happening next however many months/years, showing importance many people possible vaccinated :) really? Im long hauler dealing palpitations fast hr since habit Covid back July. Thats reason haven’t taken vaccine myocarditis concerns.  people world access vaccine.   15,000 per day dying COVID based counted cases. Actual cases must twice number.

*Vaccine percentages based 2010 census percent estimates 2-3 % lower actuality values listed using 2020 census numbers category except 65+ (5.5% lower listed % estimate). sake consistency use CDC percent estimates understand true value somewhat lower. interesting see plays out. many boot lickers. I'm shocked. Big Yellow Rain Coat too.  Yep. holiday weekend either still good news. Hell, we've dropped restrictions even hit 50% vaccination rate yet! Kicking ass. way states be. far much stupid USA. Sounds like great place be. Scotland here, v surprised get first dose Moderna today. arm killing me! science clearly shows someone fully vaccinated become infected transmit others.  See comment medical source comment.  

The chance may small, close zero almost impossible get covid someone fully vaccinated.  

It's seems pretty clear parent toddler change behaviour take steps protect child.  bringing toddler someone close contact someone COVID. optics distributing J&amp;J communities, Pfizer Moderna wealthier whiter communities, probably help.

&amp;#x200B;

I live nicely ethnically mixed neighborhood Queens. lot pharmacies long waiting lists three vaccines (I started looking early April), able get Moderna appointments public supersite. Next month see new deadly African variant, Boris still keep borders open  sure New York shut San Francisco Bayarea (7 counties so) ordered full lock-down March 17, 2020. Many companies closed in-person operations earlier that. Yeah, that's right. ever want Spanish lesson, pm me. Right, doesn’t completely reduce risk false positives, since problem could systemic sample. 

The way know sure see data established specificity many possibilities that. One could've people getting sick early Winter US, since knowledge limited, may written bad cold perhaps even different flu variant. Perhaps Covid may bit mild time frame maybe even less contagious, cause much issue. 

Plus Covid contagious, still takes time pathogen create pandemic. Take Spanish Flu example, earliest cases happened small county Kansas January 2018. pandemic however really kick months that. Covid may circulating little bit became issue. NYC's hospitals fill overnight suddenly bunch people got Covid one week. likely building New Years point. Please careful. need research possible someone vaccinated carry Covid. need spend time looking science research want good answer.    

For example, article clearly says wife's family member could transmit Covid child.   

This infectious disease specialist says vaccinated person get covid:  ""While vaccines potent, there’s still chance could become infected.""  says ""fully vaccinated people still transmit virus others"".   


_______________________    

 person vaccinated, shouldn’t need worry, right?   

I would say no. **You worry protect toddler.**   

The chance someone getting infected wife’s family member small, zero impossible. would careful. Alberta hard hit things regard sure. I’m hoping vaccine helps us back feet many actually take damn shot. people immuno compromised allergic ingredients vaccine can't get there's. Also vaccine 100% effective. They’ve reached 80%? many them? 350? 420 people? talking mRNA vaccines, name vaccine really mentioned title, there's pretty significant difference e.g. Pfizer/BioNTech Sinopharm. best friend swears caught COVID November 2019. anything use India model do. various points central government sabotaging covid response states BJP power. knew advance they'd tiny positives any, [so initial positive samples 2 subsequent assays different anticipated low prevalence SARS-CoV-2 seropositive participants January 2 – March 18, 2020, definition seropositive individual must seropositive Abbott subsequently seropositive EUROIMMUN, sites also loaded trackers ads. need information shared countless 3rd parties want see what's menu. mind idea digital menu's really long physical ones back up, make experience using *worse* paper menu absolutely make cost anything terms privacy security. Best luck mom. Im interested Pfizer. AZ reaches peak protection two weeks second dose?  know 20+ people got insanely sick weeks January 2020 attending live show. ones frequently talk to, one us ever got covid pandemic ""started"".

There really bad flu strain circulating people never got COVID plausible explanation early COVID. state dropped restrictions 40% 🙃 Yeah, Australia better get act together vaccinations - Delta whole different beast control compared wild type covid.  … Crescent Harbor! great case vaccines Nobody said anything taking peoples kids away. terribly shitty take say people suffer terrible doctors make bad voting choices. also negates people care refuse leave community. Oh interesting, wasn’t aware covid vaccines target spike protein, though knew several did. Seems remote perhaps regardless, much virus still surprising us. Here’s hoping you’re right! Still lot. states pretty low makes lot sense say that, think compassionate. reality. Children always suffer sins parents. can't take away people's children make stupid choices voting booth. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* CDC site say ""FDA requires healthcare providers report death COVID-19 vaccination VAERS, even it’s unclear whether vaccine cause."", 

But think math based annual mortality rate off.

Here VAERs guidance: (from providers strongly encouraged report VAERS:  1. adverse event occurs administration vaccine licensed United States, whether clear vaccine caused adverse event 2.  Vaccine administration errors""

So, expect connection adverse effect vaccination still needs plausible. (so someone dies car crash vaccination, would VAERS database)

I wish CDC qualified number somehow... Diego Bay! California looove  least six. There's great cdc variant tracker website. think it’s due divisive reaction CDC’s new guidance, Fauci saying “not declare victory prematurely” nurses union accused CDC endangering them. 

Businesses don’t want publicly blamed sued lift mask mandate someone establishment gets Covid, they’re taking “better safe sorry” approach keeping masks.

Especially businesses like libraries requiring masks low cost measure, since lot libraries don’t allow eat/drink begin with. saying fully vaccinated still significant protection. one fundamental issue idea: virus EXTREMELY contagious. cause massive explosion cases, explosion like occurred starting JAN, discovered first cases USA. great, I’m pretty sure also happened September 20 last year Pfft... Missouri we're barely 40% 25% places. never even state wide requirements. Vermont full slackers.

/s wait. absolutely need national strategy bring back critical infrastructure manufacturing, I’m hoping like hell enough Canadians agree make reality. Gives shit neighbors. hen care things worldview getting vaccine brainer. Honestly it’s brainer even you’re selfish. Incorrect. abandoned idea vaccine pass access public spaces bars, cinemas etc. stupidly coined 'Vaccine Passport' media. 

I got first Pfizer shot today request vaccine certificate NHS Scotland fully vaccinated. People England get card appointment serves record vaccination may well able request something formal too. unsure people NI Wales similar. act proof vaccination required travel countries. huge concern 99% politicians give crap. thing seem care deaths. Honestly Vermont consistently among best places pandemic. hung friends last summer cause numbers low. Everyone hunkered fall spike cases. 

It’s different here. People genuinely care Vermonters may never met. People wave everyone pass dirt road. It’s people make Vt great.  economic damage population ten fold seem heading another full year restriction closures. stupid. Indian strain variant interest entire time it’s clearly decimating Asia Europe faster strain seen before. Hilarious “California variant” “NY Variant” still listed variants concern Indian strain variant interest entire time    realize that, clearly seem care. love guys too, though sorta hate license plates shit Jersey, need money really appreciate nice tourists!  SK pursue eradication. US Army garrisons, SK cannot control. harbors, among busiest ones Asia. Businesses usual restrictions. etc. matter, but:

1. difficult justify restrictions everybody small minority, particularly biggest proportion can't get vaccinated (those age 12) much lower rates severe COVID
2. Overall COVID rates remain low. daily rate 4/100,000 disease mortality rate \~1% justify significant restrictions personally went doctor new rash, GI problems, sinus problems course pandemic. Never covid. also found easier ""see"" doctor year virtual appointments nothing sit home wonder others experienced thing. never know days! California huge state diverse population.

San Francisco 80%. liberal counties around 50-60% fully vaccinated.

It’s conservative, inland counties holding back. counties less 20% population vaccinated.

And there’s also fact minorities hesitant vaccines/medical situations general. Lots people poor experiences doctors due race. Community outreach programs helped dramatically, it’s still decent hurdle. spread among themselves. skin ass Agreed, good luck that, 1st amendment all.  Greetings Nashville. Nice see two us vaccinated here. Yes, 70% locals vaccinated, Covid brought tourists would hard time gaining foothold. job Manhattan tonight 9pm. way home EVERY establishment lined patrons like good old days. Glad see city recovering rapid rate.  I'm sure PR finish collages without internet soccial networks. get mad people refusing get vaccinated, people everything supposed want get lives now. horror. Wow. That’s awesome Get head. mandatory covid testing international travellers traveling upon arriving Canada air.

It would interesting details see coincidence, not. news heard TV made quite direct link. discussed much taught people mostly worries resuming travel USA, good ;) According NYT COVID-19 tracker California:

June 4, 2021: Alameda County removed many deaths causes unrelated Covid-19.

Is NYT data wrong, talking different statistics, title wrong every way?

It’s mic drop moment, “I’ve already looked source confirming couldn’t find it” Religious exemptions allowed. vaccines said ready science paper came (double blind etc.). However, especially Pfizer Moderna vaccines waited full scientific process efficacy data use public. wonder skepticism Sputnik Sinovac

Given desperate situation, accelerated use vaccines seems fully justified. case Sputnik-V, however, misunderstanding - the"" registration "" Sputnik-V August meant (according Russian laws) permission Phase 3 clinical trials Also, acknowledging difference efficacy big no-no. Even though difference 10 20% efficacy difference achieving heard immunity not. Spirit Airlines variant come punched face actual rule viruses 'more mutations = less hostile'? seem right me... granted studied virology depth beyond basic biology classes; I'm trouble seeing mechanism there... Thats total since beginning pandemic 1 day bigger dosis Astrazeneca?

If mistaken, difference doses 2 months, Astrazeneca efficiency 90% guys 66 new cases 3 new deaths yesterday. Hardly anything even get close worried about! Ha sarcastic. waited around free stuff, I'd end 6ft buried free beer cozy someone got kicked it. Vermont reach? bit weird efficacy hospitalizations death since almost others claim near 100% death 90s hospitalization

This first dose vaccine consisting two different doses. whole vaccine course effective accurate number? China informed US CDC early January 2020 well. Excerpt White House briefing 20 March, Health Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said officials alerted initial reports virus discussions CDC director Robert Redfield Chinese CDC Director Gao January 3.  Korea's cases consistently around 500 year. 

I can't see able eradicate contract tracing seeing effectively island. Sure, and? don’t mean systemic test. 

I mean systemic sample. 

A sufficiently similar antibody could trigger positive across tests.

Using different tests could reduce problem(which state paper), totally eliminate it. State votes Bernie must full sensible people, makes sense.

People seriously ill (but maybe critical) would admitted today; would December back May 2020 NYC example Bro, work one hospitals Houston. fucking clue you’re talking about. 800 covid patients admitted one point. Ben taub divert Texas children’s preparing take adults, like someone said below. Shut sit down. get legit frustrated trying pin pro-continue-lockdown types exact conditions timeframe they'll change minds.

I tried pin squirrely. Why? Tell exacting detail think happen. long lockdowns continue? conditions must reached support releasing restrictions?

Please specific! They've looking Von Willebrand Factor since beginning thing. I'm surprised took long figure out, I'm still glad did.  make much difference access any. How’s Internet Service? all? don’t understand combative adding nuance   So... what? solution stay locked rest lives? time viruses become less deadly time goes mutate. Viruses don’t want kill hosts, host dies virus inside host loses ability reproduce itself. longer host lives spreading virus others successful virus passing genetic material. means evolutionary perspective less deadly/harmful viruses generally favored deadly viruses. However, exceptions this, sometimes virus may evolve kills host long time infection (syphilis this) time virus spread others, sometimes virus develop adaptations make deadly benefit ways making adaptation worth it, sometimes viruses simply become deadly apparent reason. Lol arguing don’t clue specifics, I’m open ideas, wanted add list make accurate bc it’s definitely solely matter people horny lockdowns Mods, allow articles like posted clearly going elicit responses violate rules sub? Either acknowledge science sub (if want that, go r/COVID19) relax posting restrictions political posts take stories like this. wow. fucking prick ""Vaccines highly effective hospitalisation Delta variant. analysis suggests:

- Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine 96% effective hospitalisation 2 doses

- Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine 92% effective hospitalisation 2 doses""

You're talking arse mate part agree — main concern long took first time. Based recent history, lockdowns happen govt officials little cost benefit analysis realize would better economy avoid mass graves remain open. set thresholds cases concrete public health plan place shut properly if/when cases rise winter, fear states US learned round 1. Welcome new exotic viral variants travel destinations around world. great way keep genetic diversity rolling increase chances viral escape immunological pressures natural vaccine induced immunity. long lockdowns continue people safe? want specifics. conditions would support removing restrictions? specific, please.  Gamma actually comes third Greek alphabet delta. think anyone wants continue forever...not sure hanging with

They deny want that, try pin conditions necessary lift restrictions, either hem haw, list conditions know impossible ever achieve. current CDC guidelines state currently infected covid showing symptoms administered vaccine clear infection. Uh Work home? get would go work...I fortunate immunocompromised/friends family immunocompromised + can’t get vaxed don’t trust vaccines gone vigorous clinical trials, past clinical phases, proven effective reducing spread, hospitalizations, deaths, yet trust random dealers street selling psychedelics? 

A interesting mindset trust there. personally confirm!

I couple ignorant jerk relatives said would this.

I've lost much respect people. I’m fully protected Pfizer vaccine two days! quarantining me! article says similar tests moderna got similar results, reason doesn’t list them. Similar results everybody would expect though. advising before, hadn’t testing that. can’t tell certainty help even harm you.

But booster conversation table, keep bringing question back up. hopefully get answer soon.

Also, one got J&amp;J vaccine gullible pleb. wasn’t long ago supply low desperately wanted protected. I’d reserve term people actually believe 5G theories. Yeah seems like reduced efficacy, keeps reducing every variation point new vaccine need made think so. first sentence article reports info, think. Check link! smell. reliable site? really news site creates stories. simple site makes news Netherlands available English. write English article Dutch news story Netherlands.

The original source article survey HartVanNederland, one news media channels. Yep, Tokyo, so… that’s fun. think it’s fearmongering imply two doses mRNA vaccines anything extremely effective known variants

No one, experience, ever implied two doses effective variants. much strawman.

The Americans sub need remember rest world fortunate readily accessible, full course vaccines every citizen wants it. world still yet *any* dose all, fully vaccinated. 

The Delta variant becoming dominant strain around world preying people. need understand variants concerning them. applies Americans. may depend many unvaccinated covid already. people know refusing vaccine covid aren’t careful all. sue also like AZ? bonkers comparing Vermont's 80% eligible people whole population Mississippi. MS already one worst states vaccinations, purposefully using bad comparison?

For reference, Vermont 60% whole population. Oh :( Japan? Hmm. seems Rt delta around 1. guys keep 1 controlled. mRNA vaccine technology largely developed USA though. J&amp;J?  Says one got Pfizer shot would say one important thing consider age-range Covid likely cause worst outcomes in. mean even overall vaccination rates low parts country, rates still high 65+ age groups people illnesses make susceptible unlikely see anywhere near hospitalization death rates previous waves. said, could still certainly fun. Go get vaccinated people! people asking ""what J&amp;J??"", article literally starts addressing week, study reported Johnson &amp; Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine protected SARS-CoV-2 variants concern. Now, Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine shown protect several SARS-CoV-2 variants well. want kids vaccinated want wait lower dose Pfizer. don’t want dose adults. reliable site? owns it? survey done? recruit sample? Sorry article reads much like Rupert Murdoch media news piece. Also curious… That’s really works. virus principally kills past reproductive age, doesn’t effect whether genetics impact immune system gets passed on. age, immune systems, strongest, fine. Also “A virus killed less effective immune systems humanity better fewer folks weaker immune systems may impacted virus doesn’t make much sense social level. good people less susceptible viral disease bad bunch people died viral disease. reason USA got ""last"" despite shitloads people travelling USA around world every day.

You either treat another respiratory disease causes little trouble going full panic mode locking everything every 3-4 months. Probably. 

But honest, pretty sure happen next week. Also, noticed lot people care anymore wear mask anymore, really matter? probably enforcing places anymore anyways. Tomato fruit   depends are. Germany people pretty much exclusively call BioNTech. time agree, journalism also dying. mostly copying find (or given press statement) without trying understand adapt. Vaccines mean can't die covid gett hospitalised reduces risk dramatically. That’s good hear, got Pfizer vax days ago Thank gatekeeping name vaccine  EMA (Europe’s agency) recommended people 16 vaccinated. saying vaccinate young people pre-existing conditions. I‘m anti-vaxx all, received first dose today, think it’s smart wait vaccinating kids. Unless mean measles polio stuff. Parents definitely take care   ""i heard ppl"" sums pandemic 1.5 year info clusterfuck pretty perfectly Nancy boy right Yep I'd imagine around 5 percent get second dose ever reason No, J&amp;J vaccine effective variants little data mixing matching. 👽from another 🌎  posted link discusses study showing J&amp;J vaccine effective variants. Reddit cover ""sexy"" vaccine. Also add many people NYC area already thus immunity even yet get vaccinated. like interject moment. referring Pfizer, fact, BioNTrch/Pfizer, I've recently taken calling it, BioNTech plus Pfizer. go outside live life.  officials reported Delta (Indian) variant determined sequencing Moscow anyone provide explanation effective others.

Like mystery vaccines making antibodies  could identify sort virus

Did expect sequence flu virus flu don’t know COVID-19, sure odd timing severe unidentified respiratory virus.

Flu season actually extremely normal time get flu. also normal ""unidentified"" see etc.. etc.. end May pfizer approved India, think many people India (if any) vaccinated pfizer.   Oh ""heard"" that? got data citation something read facebook? Yea officials reported Delta (Indian) variant determined sequencing Moscow, maybe right Definitely. Both. save money cos haven’t invested mRNA tech (so can’t produce locally) federal government (who literally tasked TWO things entire response) put eggs AZ basket.

They decided vax roll urgent cos borders shut hotel quarantine fabulous.

They also didn’t order enough Pfizer November countries so.

Result - 2.5 billion dollar day cost lockdown … covered mean released: despite fucking mounds evidence showing it’s safe effective, concluded “heard people India died” it? Remind never trust judgement. J/J keep alive hospital, rapidly reduce spread COVID.  J/J one shot need kept extremely cold. LOT benefits J/J.

In world, Pfizer/Moderna would gone everyone 60 and/or work service jobs first, rest us would get J/J, would effectively end threat COVID.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, MMR shot 78% effective mumps. many people met last 50 years mumps? lot expensive vaccine, that's sure. Okay, cool. headlines using jargon like 'variant rapidly increasing', others like myself, think steep increase total new cases, caused new variant. question, expect so, based technology. Thank this! God hope so.

I usually enjoy telling someone told - typically negative expense way.

I'll make exception case. aware that, Johnson Johnson vaccine would doubt offer stronger protection two dose regimen, tested clinical trials option. heard sky yellow. must true. Hang know find source somewhere… oh yeah heard sisters moms cousins Facebook post. USA state Pfizer-BioNTech Mine $140. updated comment above. Restaurants open dine since last year. Toronto 80% one dose still can't dine indoors, 4 people per table outside, get haircut, go gym, go see movie. Still much locked city 3 million seeing 100 daily cases. expectations

The natural selection random mutation understander logged think Putin wants less people get vaccinated.  go back get mRNA shot yet. Although theoretically similar recovered people going shot probably better wait see studies. successive spike mutation, vaccines become less effective. happens J&amp;J affected moreso. Since globally effective effort eradicate disease incredibly virulent (even vaccinated folks spreading it, evidenced recently), pandemic likely continue next years. means safely bet boosters research backed plan folks like yourself; likely ones going back subsequent shots. safe, effective, free, ubiquitous vaccine. hasn’t tested really isn’t reason couldn’t get kinds enough time shots. I’m sure talked fall/winter decide need boosters. current face mask rules wear face mask publicly accessible buildings moving around age 13. staying still/seated need mask. There's never outdoors mask mandate. fine €95,-.

So 72% NL residents want mask rule stopped.

Recently OMT, Dutch COVID-19 expert advisory group, also advocated stopping mask rules.

The government considering letting go mask rule next week, they've made final decision yet. make decision Friday announce day COVID-19 press conference, also explain 4th final step reopening plan possibly go effect 26 June. 2 relaxations large events planned basic measures stay place. known basic measures let go of. Thanks. expensive antibody test? heard like $30 so. Exactly

-sent Foxconn phone still aren’t allowing everyone get vaccinated UK? That’s odd sure, vaccinations open 18+ US several months now.  bad could final wave fall US 35-40% people remain unvaccinated Delta becomes dominant variant? daily case counts look like?

I’d assume nowhere near bad 2020, might still deemed unacceptably high. matter fade, long T-cell response, harder measure.

Here ton information,  People often forget mask wearing effective COMBINED 1 2 meter physical distance, hand washing quarantining exhibiting symptoms.

When fully vaccinated also longer interesting wear mask unlikely spread virus.   far know, delta variant dangerous young people older variants, though.  mean. still get sick? Incidence often what's used public health rather absolute numbers. yes probably implicitly mentioning increase relative variants (# new case variant x / sum cases). happen incidence COVID-19 decrease (# new cases / total population). detla varient included tests, claim protecting varients bit misleading. making prediction works varients panel may also work varients panel. Also, important point looking protects people severe desiese, mean can't get sick shed virus others. humans are.... antivax uncle announced longer wearing mask comes visit immune compromised Mom. shots, hope she'll okay. story also exactly title talking about... continue hear unvaccinated people spent long periods time hospital recently course regret decision. Well vaccinating like crazy us. great news! I've wanting come visit Europe awhile miss guys!  I’ve taken vaccines before, new one refuse actually pass FDA admittedly hesitant on. Would ever hire mechanic said accept risk service? “I might fix car might work regardless take responsibility cannot sue me.Sounds good?

Two vaccinated passengers tested positive == even vaccinated folks spreading it

???? believe issue dosing vector vaccines works. used half first dose second dose full, efficacy high, 2 full doses short interval around 70%. since push use asap, go phase 3 confirm ""error"" dosage actually correct one.. 
Ever since time doses increased 8-12 weeks efficacy comparable Pfizer per data UK. time passes seems, longer 2nd dose, stronger immunity (thus probably expect higher percentage efficacy variants people get 2nd dose better data)..

 issue short timing used vector doses (unlike Sputnik V) thus short interval immune system kills much shot gets job done.. 

I sorry sources mobile.. disagree variants!! really it’s like calling Eminem - real slim shady 

Universal music publishing’s song real slim shady likely. antibodies same, every vaccine makes different types antibodies variants!! REALLY think that's that's going required? scribbled piece paper anyone could write out? whole purpose proposed ""vaccine passports"" create official system people can't forge. know.......like passport.  no, reddit also outside america, majority news posted refer american websites, call Pfizer semantics needed. Doesnt mean cant still get   Damn close USA almost restrictions left anywhere country, no, another huge outbreak. another endemic corona virus point. plenty already, throw pile.  company said never mandate covid tests. another company?  Cases always going go down. death rate important. that's going positive 👍 Vaccines prevent spread. vaccines now. info CDC website now... US already 10% delta. Europe closed UK mostly Delta variant now. Expect happen US weeks EU still couple weeks behind US UK terms Delta variant spread. well, sexy me... one done! arent even back normal all. Watch, they're another huge outbreak long Nope. cannot get hospitalized American vaccines. There's 0% chance hospitalized. really understand 92% 96% mean you? reason allowed walk outside inside without mask on. still 8% chance getting hospitalized one would go outside ever... That's huge chance getting hospitalized. see numbers USA? states high vaccination rates unvaccinated people dying. single death fully vaccinated people. vaccinated people going hospital either cause getting sick (8% 'chance get sick) getting asymptomatic sick cannot spread either. Dude I've going gym without mask month 8% get hospitalized every single person gym would hospital right now. /r/Pedantic fully vaccinated, time go back normal. Welcome new normal, old one. Full text: number new coronavirus infections recorded daily dropped 800 first time months, according latest figures Sciensano Public Health Institute published Wednesday morning. 6 12 June, **average 764 new coronavirus infections detected per day**, 42% compared previous week.

Must magnetic field repelling variants. /s  Theres incidences latest cruise ship two vaccinated passengers tested positive. 

Per official CDC Fully vaccinated people reduced risk transmitting SARS-CoV-2 unvaccinated buy iPhone Amazon call Amazon phone? air updates, pretty cool. Thanks clarifying! incorrect.
Chile's vaccination rate june 14th 61% first dose, 48% fully Chile overwhelmingly used dubiously affective CoronaVac vaccine. efficacy rate ~60% (compared 90+% mRNA that's fair, ever-decreasing number unvaccinated people; makes shot increasingly limited usefulness. lot cities already vaccinated homeless populations one 3 major vaccines, J&amp;J one essentially becomes useless since can't used second dose anyway. travel That's still crazy. vaccines we'd truly fucked R0 7. people dying reproductive age underlying conditions won’t effect future generations? Lol OK. Anywhere find Jensen new variants? Would need sort booster later something? 25% people get long-lasting symptoms. Mental ones. There's ton broken brains there. Thats literally got here! doubled incidence, doubled share. Although project true incidence doubled, smaller number sequences week 21 allows increased sampling errors. confidently say variant growing increasing absolute incidence, would need see absolute increases numbers week week. agree ya powers be....the powers haha like, point, ride wave can't go like forever every single variant comes around. Catching Spreading happen, vaccine prevents major complications keep hospitals 👍 like people COVID, recommend waiting least 3 months infection get vaccine

The CDC recommends 3 month wait treated convalescent serum antibody therapy. recovered without that, suggest waiting longer need isolate (so put others risk waiting line shot...)

see ""COVID-19 vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection"" section. confirm Canada order something Amazon say got Amazon... don’t say specific company Amazon bought it. bro, already spread true Yeah something tells proof vaccines required travel tad sophisticated piece paper. Many Western governments prefer J&amp;J groups planning second shot would difficult (for number different reasons), like refugees homeless persons. always going certain demand one. Also shut everything 1 2 vaccinated people test positive Man really wish vaccine would get approved children soon. two youngest ones haven’t able get yet family. kept home school last year that’s option next school year. hope get vaccinated school year starts. live incredibly selfish area really low vaccination rate they’ve already removed mask mandate summer school can’t see brought back fall. pet peeve? frustration talking about? 

Thank sharing issues, guess.  sure downvoted. mRNA vaccines work fine vs delta variant. practical reason segment actually receive it. makes easier compare different place's vaccine uptake since may varying demographics place. Let's calm down. Chile using chinese vaccines, well known effective, UK using AZ, USA even approve. 

I think fine. Y’all visiting families, stay home. muricans though, spend money. come in. Right?? Germans acting like word “Pfizer” isn’t German af. agree y'all lol reassuring see new variants been, far, controlled current vaccination strategy. already Yes, saying it’s wrong Americans call Pfizer vaccine, it’s BioNTech’s vaccine well, created it. lot people don’t know BioNTech even is, would good get recognition US press well. get fucking vaccine.  Looking actual study itself, appears looked blood 5 people gotten Pfizer vaccine concluded antibodies work 3 variants. right?

It's difficult understand study ones I've seen here. feel like see exact headline posted every week.  Asshole. scientist invented mRNA technology [Hungarian lives US. call Hungarian vaccine? 

My vaccine card says Pfizer/BioNtech. companies played extremely important role - one developed one distributed. vaccine would gotten arm anyone else’s without Pfizer distributing it. might well exist.

Oh, luckily sure? long term effects then? don’t home lockdown anywhere permanent quarantine. homeless people aren’t complete loners, spend lot time coming contact people whether that’s homeless people, staying groups safety, asking people help streets, staying tightly packed homeless shelters. Especially winter. assume things might little better I’m Chicago (not sure whether original comment referring specific area deleted) there’s “sleeping streets” option winter—you find place hole die. homeless people also spend intermittent time street, trying stay friends family least temporarily. Even sleeping outside many homeless folk form groups sleep together, pool resources, share tents, etc going food pantries puts crowded locations. 

And imagine beginning pandemic might date latest covid news, wouldn’t know spread didn’t knowledge resources take precautions necessary. enough outreach homeless people let know latest vaccines? loop demographics allowed get vaccinated given time? know don’t need insurance payment get vaccine? do, able get somewhere get vaccinated? imagine can’t walk anywhere make appointment—I’ve seen homeless people one occasion get kicked store homeless without business waiting find money not. vaccination sites open homeless people? know beginning many elderly people trouble making vaccine appointments made online complicated websites quickly ran appointments, would get problem homeless people too.

Considering there’s slightly elevated risk getting, say, mild version delta variant even AZ Pfizer vaccines, wonder offer protection long term effects disease vaccinated people get sick. It’s early tell, interesting see vaccines work this. Germany criticised slow start, things moving along well. 

More importantly, incidence rate plummeted 13/100,000 federally, even lower many places. **It plateau 35/100,000 warned 'experts' week ago.**

The RKI removed 100 countries 'risk' list, states opening earlier anticipated, mask requirements certain outdoor areas removed, etc. 

(We Germans find difficult positive sometimes, want highlight quickly tide turned, even vaccination slow start) units IgM IgG values values seem extremely low protection. Thought second time easier since immune system knows fight virus Checkt comments, beggining article part..
public transit, medical, schools things still require masks. changes first.

Not sure restaurants stuff like that, business still whatever want regardless. Great time remove mask mandates open everything US, I'm settling back ""normal"" life again.

Oxford AZ protection measurably mRna vaccines pretty much studies I've seen date, much less protection varies studies

Vaccines work training body's immune system prepare disease (eg covid19), AZ uses adrenovector ""prep"" immune system Pfizer/moderna used mRNA technology. mRNA better/best training immune system covid-19 based studies far. booster shots like second lesson, matter get one first time. 

Mixing vaccines quite common based studies maybe actually better mix especially got AZ first since mRNA vaccines better. like taking class one personal trainer get better trainer second time. Still better one good trainer 2 classes mediocre trainer 

I got AZ first dose well glad get mRna second dose since want higher protection. would've better got mRNA least I'll one shot mRNA layperson opinion, seems 65+ 50-64. everyone younger broad cohort less risk. controlling health conditions.

Joint pain tired 12 hours.  second (Moderna) felt generally run 36 hours second dose, mild headache, gone morning. oldest child (Moderna) chills, fever, headache nausea starting 12 hours second, lasted 18 hours. middle child (J&amp;J) chills flu like symptoms 12 hours dose. Lasted six hours. youngest (Pfizer) nothing sore arm. 


Drink lots water. Take Tylenol after. Shower, lounge, nap. Whatever feel like doing. varies know get there. know last long. True. Many follow EU guidelines though. that! cat's claws hurt worse far. Moderna similar BNT/Pfizer mRNA vaccines make body produce spike protein. others thread pointed out, reasonable assume data published regarding efficacy one vaccine less also applies other. I’m mostly salty live MO, I’m pretty sure there’ll lottery vaccinated point way state going. vaccinations mandatory (for get it) every 100 patients treated, experts calculate, would save six lives.   get decide clients won’t serve (unless they’re discriminating race, gender, age, sexual identity, disability protected reasons).

Nice circular argument there.

That aside, even everyone board vaccinated, someone tests positive anyways? False positives still thing. please hurt yourself

it's answer

I'm tired too, last year bad year me, I'm fully vaccinated now, things opening back up, I'm going concert summer (if get cancelled again!) think things get better. Don’t make bathtub time. decent chunk folk getting saying ""poison"" created quickly/no long term studies. good thing took year get r0 7. imagine original strain infectious, countries started locking down. can't even think wouldve looked like world works well 2 doses, mostly older people recieved AZ, 2nd dose now. Young people primarily given Pfizer (myself included). single dose AZ still great protecting serious illness too, even Delta variant. 

The UK fully vaccinated people US people vaccinated general. hoping US another similiar small wave like UK, that's is. basing anything hunch. vaccinated certainly good news :) need focus vaccinating eligible vaccinated drive R number make difficult new variants emerge since there's always risk vaccines effective future variants I'm sure one wants go back began lol Obviously good pessimistic it, important goal need keep mind said, German company BioNtech definitely developed best vaccine, thank that.

Honestly, Moderna vaccine EVERY bit good. two mRNA vaccines essentially identical intents purposes (excluding slight difference adverse reaction rates likely due Moderna using higher titer mRNA). Pfizer-BioNTech news generating data due Pfizer's planning ahead. disrespect you, never understand little give fuck anymore. Seriously, would rather get covid die spend another tear house, school, friends, watching news put fucking death counter right anchor's head! I'm done. I'm done. understand concern, respect it, ultimately, care stupid virus anymore. Reoccurences increased severity [are certainly However, knowledge actual probability. bedridden situation. could work one ppl get side effects beyond sore arm. waaaay different actually ill--it side effect end date. studies? variant? subjects? statistical significance results? going claim somthing absolutely true, provide proper evidence. Otherwise absolutely reason believe anything say. talking man ? evidence proven link vaccines fungus infection, anything, people vaccinated much less likely fungus infection related covid. basically mutations eventually outpacing vaccinations point virus could potentially remain one step ahead future vaccination efforts? pandemic taught people shitheads.  end. Every vaccine potential risks. people bad reactions. vast majority people long term issues vaccinated. vaccines general population like year now. Vaccine side effects show within first months. 

Like every medical procedure ever risk. There’s risk involved taking Tylenol damage liver. people probably bad reactions it. mean pull market? No. reward outweighs risk vast majority population.

Not everything conspiracy. novel virus. didn’t know anything scientists regularly changing stances based newest research. one lied you. didn’t know. among vaccinated. among people want right thing protect family, friends even strangers. among people want help country defeat covid.

It happen people begging get covid. Many get wish. point start live without restrictions, then? vaccine isn’t key is? Exactly, it’s speculation - I’m telling vaccines wouldn’t caused this. 

Covid proven bad, vaccines proven good - don’t “ spray “ people covid, scientists labs testing. 

Come guy. Eventually world accept flu level cases deaths. approaching level delta variant looks like increasing hospitalization death rate it’s concerning. However doses vaccines work I’m camp opening too. also partially shutdown really bad variant happens. Wait, what. Germany extended 4 week gap 6 weeks. 12 weeks seems excessive  what? FYI, authors tested Moderna vaccine results similar Pfizer. inline fact vaccines nearly identical. funny, end nightclubs, can't go back person teaching final restrictions lifted, send vaccines abroad we've fixed shit. 19th July last date, may seem like anything serious im going insane government's incompetence makes worse

Just life good mean great everyone else drop 95% 80% trivial. four times increase number people infected challenged Delta vs original strain. Big difference children can't vaccinated. whole Asia would like word talked 3 different maskers yesterday:


Person 1: I’m asthmatic doctor said continue wear mask.


Person 2: I’m fully vaxxed lot people know aren’t, protecting them. know 2 people died Covid.


Person 3: uhh I’m sure, seems like everybody wearing ??!

As employee, company somewhat randomly decided could stop wearing masks July 4. Power unconscious mind? I’ve got news you, unconscious mind won’t keep getting covid let alone disease “ think “ can’t. 

That’s immune systems work. vaccine companies already researching preparing third doses booster needed. Per authors paper:

“Our interpretation results vaccine antibodies powerful, even lose 3-fold titer, still plenty antibody neutralize virus. believe findings demonstrate vaccines remain protective variants tested,” said Landau. “While it’s reported paper, **we done experiments Moderna vaccine got similar results.**”

This inline nature vaccine, Moderna Pfizer vaccine incredibly similar. Unless see specific news one different (such side effects) same. wait till next, deadly, one hits. Last fall weren’t sure vaccine would effective. Besides variant making doses vaccines ineffective pandemic mostly developed world. issue variants occur developed world far behind vaccines.  Like humans post anything online including you? worries, happens us! many Dr.’s accounts denying it’s COVID expire. read things headed. certainly agree there, I'm saying think private businesses wrong require vaccine 100% effective preventing death. dumbest shit I’ve heard. 

VACCINES CAUSE Nevertheless masses see us crazy conspiracy theorists. someone followed drugs data day 1 benchtop research. made laugh. hits (me) pretty damn hard still better COVID day. Absolutely, get lax even vaccinated. sister vaccinated caught strain, vaccine saved life still sick nearly hospitalized. underlying health condition, risk, believe we, vaccinated people, still taking precautions. Yup. Suns greeted ton fans airport almost unmasked, maybe that's got it. 33% Delta variant one dose 88% two doses according UK study. study link include Delta variant variant currently gaining spread U.S. article pretty misleading.
But probably fine unless live low vaccination area high percentage Delta cases black person, think moving away ""whitelist"" ""blacklist"" indicative stupid society all, understanding sensitive one. 70% adults many states gotten least one dose vaccine. Probably would ideal vaccines 70% whole country would need wait forever that. I’m sorry isn’t vaccines work really furthers bullshit anti vaxxers trying spread. really liked getting cold last year. People gross don’t need socialize store Tylenol dont recognize paracetamol : ) ew  Weird thing much lower general population. We're 80% adult population first dose (and opened 25s yesterday, meaning overall acceptance probably 85-90%).

Surely care home staff acutely aware benefits vaccine. I’m sorry. sucks mild allergies first time start pandemic guy company healthline call sniffly commiserated, he'd found got hay fever year. Go figure.  Thanks! Whatever happens it’ll worth :) Shooting messenger.

The post reminds us stupid society (not post bad, phenomenon describes), gets downvoted. didn’t even get sticker! Needless fear-mongering.  I’m regular (before Covid) cruise ship passenger. NEVER get cruise ship passengers aren’t required fully vaccinated. End message. opinion articles. Heaven’s Gates(1)

1. Proof vaccination required soon....  engine smoking side road would.
Getting vaccine KEEP pandemic retuning/happening fundamentally different getting vaccine MIDDLE pandemic.
The people died, became disabled, took *new* vaccines got vaccinated get snallpox/polio/measles/etc. 
Perhaps even today.
As far guarantee-nothing us guaranteed. reason get thise illnesses bc vaccines perfect. enough ppl got create herd immunity.
Lastly: business. public health. I've never seen study showed Pfizer 95% one dose. like 80% (less variants). true pretty remarkable. read study I'm guessing may wide CI can't see Moderna *that* much effective Pfizer one dose despite significantly larger dose. Washington state. personally followed restrictions. Funny people make assumptions. I'm saying nobody making sure people followed rules plenty not. OCD too. vaccine godsend me, since uncertainty possible infection general pandemic worries terrible me.

Any side effects get gone within 1-2 days. Could maybe pass case food poisoning? take couple Tylenol power through. Or, fails, maybe spend weekend friend get it. Dad shorts. Euro finals. 2016 around 40% tickets went general public. regional, unfortunately. areas much higher rates areas much lower rates Look words educate yourself. ass pockets whiskey. RL Burnside
(if ya like blues) That’s better US. Staff vaccination rates vary 40-60%, resident rates generally 

It’s painful dangerous considering weakened immune systems sick/old residents. def paranoia walking around. decreasing bit slowly knowledge, mNRA vaccines yes… I’m familiar vector vaccines work though. Maybe infusion spike protein virus changes some? Maybe someone knowledgeable lend insight, it’s good question Please God yes!!! forget CDC experts saying, owner Charlie’s Best Burgers think? guy made ninja edit post.

He added entire paragraph, argued original vaccine (at preventing metric, death) calculated comparing portion vaccinated vs control individuals end outcome.

Also. Look words educate yeah. dallas specifically week (at stores go to) ive noticed staff maybe 50-75% customers masked. 

i found wearing one cuz folks were. lately time dont wear one im full vaxxed also sheltered place absolutely nobody going around enforcing anything. Washington state. restrictions enforced? VaCCinAteDAgAInStWHaT? quick google indicates information since January Morons seem greatest natural resource, unfortunately. realize said wrong meant say math incomplete.

I'm wrong, vaccine quite certainly 100% effective preventing death, full complete understanding vaccine effectiveness. relevant discussion.

Also, made ninja edit first response. Downvoted paywall new cases weeks? sure that? live ""liberal"" Washington state even gotten 50% vaccinated still cases over. necessarily, whole idea stop deaths hospitals overwhelmed. 1 shot strategy could useful case. US never actually ""shut down"" really understand talking about. hear you. school starting fall, I'm furious people get vaccinated refuse to. Nothing absolute disgust intense anger chunk selfish people. can't crow sunshine roses kids safe. Money invention. actually unlimited. mean actual resources money represents limited right money tool can, do, manipulate will.  delta bad boy there's strong statistical probability significant portion 47% level immunity infected virus.

Covid needs wipe idiots out. Sounds like like attention vaccinated back February, according article. Pfizer. Oh nice, thx devil’s advocate, homemade cloth masks like one least effective masks there, according scientific studies, i’m one people worn throughout pandemic! go figure May, Iowa allowing [individual health providers decide whether require parental 12-15 year olds, might worth calling vaccination site see you’d able consent yourself. Seems likely considering you’re outside range anyway. assume spike protein essential cellular entry replication parts virus. Since mRNA vaccines encode spike protein, antibodies also targeted toward various parts spike protein. less likely pick non-essential features virus vector, could mutate wildly without compromising virulence. Alternatively, antibodies produced multiple parts spike protein, even one part mutates still antibodies parts. Lucky you. hopefully right friends family neighbourhood unaffected. shitty disease killed 2 people know, horribly, leaving young families fatherless, want :( study review revealed doses, Pfizer vaccine showed 88 percent effectiveness symptomatic disease caused Delta variant compared 93 percent Alpha variant. Two doses AstraZeneca vaccine 66 percent effective Alpha 60 percent Delta. single dose either two vaccines, vaccine effectiveness 51 percent Alpha variant compared 33 percent Delta.

Are still going pretend mRNA adenovirus vaccines equally effective difference variants circulation trials? I’d take snowstorms bunch selfish walking Petri dishes. Even US fully vaccinated still bound get infected thanks new mutations countries. way minimise effect covid vaccinate majority people countries. Till guarantee protection summary, show Delta VOC Scotland found mainly younger, affluent groups. Risk COVID-19 hospital admission approximately doubled Delta VOC compared Alpha VOC, risk admission particularly increased five relevant comorbidities. **Both Oxford–AstraZeneca Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines effective reducing risk SARS-CoV-2 infection COVID-19 hospitalisation people Delta VOC**, effects infection appeared diminished compared Alpha VOC. insufficient numbers hospital admissions compare vaccines respect. Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine appeared less effective Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection Delta VOC. Given observational nature data, estimates vaccine effectiveness need interpreted caution.

How interpret section bolded second last paragraph correspondence linked to. seems like drawing different conclusion source. Baltimore county, Carroll county, Anne Arundel county spend time think would really cool someone would compile big table lists vaccines rows variants columns cells says whether vaccine shown protect variant conditions (e.g. read vaccines protect variants two weeks second dose - much later 'prime' Covid) plus sources. would like much better daily article says 'XY protects ABC now!'. sure. still advised skip second dose, really clincher protection variants. Still though, incredible news truly groundbreaking achievement. 

I suspect discover eventually require much lower doses they're giving right - that's generally new pharmaceuticals vaccines work, wonder we'll ever get single shot regimen. Mostly honor system. chose follow rules bc best. essential stores would also kick didn’t mask literally EVERYTHING else closed except essential stores. really do? could break rules wanted, like you’d get arrested would go? wanted go friends house certainly could nobody going feel sorry got COVID then! pharmaceutical company make money selling Ivermectin? already commonly sold pharmaceutical companies used treat parasite infestations? I’m American currently Istanbul ….. foreign Turkey handles covid. I’m amazed diligent turkey controlling spread well sad US has, looking back now. 

I knew bad ….. really didn’t anything compare to. goodness see people enter malls (via hes code, proof vaccination) think theres acclimation period. People used wearing masks (its really burdensome made be). takes little time come around it. understand correctly, unlikely strain Covid resistant vaccine. vaccine specifically targets spike proteins Covid-19 used enter cells long spike proteins present, vaccine still works pretty well.

If spikes altered bunch, removed completely, longer contagious currently anyways (and point even ""crown"" gives name).  good protection severe illness. 94% Pfizer delta variant. course same, full protection full regimen, every dose counts! half time walk store i’m expecting employee shout “EXCUSE ME, NEED WEARING MASK” like pandemic days doesn’t happen Pfizer 90% effective Moderna 88% delta variant.  Exactly, difference perfect accurate measure common sense practical one. cases end aberrant requirements. see expecting another wave Covid, Brit urge see risks Delta variant went percent 90% dominance week two here, we're vaccinated similar level USA. Numbers low turned steep corner here, worry exactly USA complacency.  also subepidemic, endemic disease. That's far likely path. find anything effectiveness J&amp;J vaccine delta variant could let know? I’m almost considering getting Pfizer vaccine cannot find answer. got J&amp;J vaccine back March, I’m actually feeling kind exposed right seeing Pfizer 90% effective delta vs 96%, Moderna 88% vs 95%. Wtf say J&amp;J 66% effective COVID-19 begin with?? still catch spread even jabs 

Unlikely? Sure 

But possible general? Also yes fuck dosing schedule. it. Make sure hydrated relaxed, go talk doctor worried. rough time second dose, still worth extra protection variants currently. thing urban Texas. mask mandate ended Austin fully vaccinated people, almost everyone still wore masks. Now, 1 month later, probably 50-60% people stores restaurants maskless. allow power focus number cases whole, problems though

A) still catch spread Covid got jabs 

B) places refuse open back jabs done, giving power people plans get jab’s even put tons roadblocks in-front 

So end looks like way read many claim wait till every anti vax drops dead Covid, extremely unlikely happen time soon let’s face it, Covid deadly enough get herd immunity (if it’s possible way hill anti vax skulls 

So ask, goalpost here, leave fates hands idiots don’t care enough wanna say maybe 1/5 people go without masks stores chicago, ratio increasing every day hit 100% global vaccinations virus would die out. continues spread hosts. Last read roughly 0.000014% chance cause heart problems. Everything COVID worse. Yes. reason CV good effectiveness spikes. Even new variants contagious better spikes, we’re still going spikes largely nullifying threat. conditions today existed March 2020, wouldn’t sweating much. study came yesterday Pfizer Delta saying 78% effective preventing infection 90% hospitalization. 

It's 95% variants, hence range.

They still great vaccines everyone get them. mean charge “forest” would worse off. jerk “truth” whatever think someone lies achieve desirable end result, sure it’s lie, ends net positive society. guess truth important society’s well-being, it’s good thing you’re charge people’s lives. It’s obviously complicated “lying bad” safety frontline workers stake.  Honestly mate steel shield, helps reduce severity transmission. still get sick still transmit others, less *for current variants concern* (and sooner later another variant concern could quite vaccine-proof, sooner allow Delta take hold population). people this? People obsessed flu July demand probably drop anyways Germany really matter anymore. many anti-vaxx. effective J&amp;J delta variant though?  much wanna bet people going complain U.S. donating vaccines countries? supposed meet second love life? also gain side effect data rolled fast. safety questions late last year answered.

Every drug side effects, different, risks low. still wish US done back Feb/March, even people skip second shot could easily get good go two weeks. :-\ guess mean breakthrough case person gets virus despite vaccinated rarely happens sure saying. saying encourage vaccinated people physically comfortable wearing masks ourselves. Continued mask wearing contributes unnecessary anxiety wearing slightly uncomfortable masks. 

We need break fear cycle demonstrating longer afraid. Lol.

""Making control group real world scenario 'common knowledge'""

Man, bloody clue. I'm already engaged we’re helping India vaccines. source that? quite assertion, I'd like check myself! Moderna gang at!? Yes, timing reporting. fact daily numbers getting low enough zeros exist state 40 million impressive.  2% breakthrough infections end death patient. Wait till Delta^2 comes Yeah way viruses work tend create lot variants alot stage. We're going see variants coming months regards covid cycle gonna repeat. 


""The 128th variant discovered! Pfizer's vaccine protect it!?!?""

Chances are: yes does.  add-on sports packages. I'm sure possible disqualification due Covid infection big concern among Olympic athletes year well. Wonder downvoted? crucial factor people often forget testing environment large scale disease spread actively happens. easier collect data people get conclusive results within short span time millions people contracting virus daily basis across world. approved US, would fewer patients take blood samples. Would interesting know though, since got pretty bad rep moment. 

All data UK though seems indicate high effectiveness AZ alpha delta variants, judging hospital admissions least, seems like good news far.  lot Teachers / Parents (Including wife) really scared children's safety. want vaccines children. Many parents saying going keep wearing masks children get vaccine.  


I think scientists could better job explaining risks (both deaths, effects). variants start thin herd anti-vaxxers, perhaps feel different

It's disturbing read sentiments Reddit. Casually talking death others, even deem less intelligent, different risk-reward assessment, make us spread means opportunity variant arise resistant vaccines

While literally true spread means opportunity, actuality people vaccinated, less selection pressure virus evade vaccine-induced immunity; virus still large arena replicate in. variants arising happen little better targeted vaccines.

The worrisome situation *large* proportion population vaccinated yet still spread. see real pressure virus evade vaccine-induced immunity. See paper research, also contradicts messaging ""in order evade vaccines, virus would become less fit/infectious"".  extent, say immunocompromised handle better weren't. son cystic fibrosis attends school another child well, maintining 15 feet distance (yes, 15), washing hands, sanitizing things touching wearing mask new things him. genuinely confused people acted like literally locked cage forever stop breathing walmart.   us cannot needles, news patch vaccine apply surface skin seeps in? math that's left common knowledge nobody needs see it, new number need 400/150,000,000 vaccines thing that's new. virus continues mutate variants increasingly breakthroughs. already showing decreased effectiveness Delta variant even mRNA vaccines. Get facts right. Cheers, put clearly hopefully explains urge caution getting complacent despite shouted happen USA somehow different. recently reach Kappa variant too? experience? get test fly back right? shit doesn’t mutate something worse. Like people trying tell people last year goddamned half. Canada, though. TLDR:

7389 blood donation samples collected 2019-12-13 2020-01-17 across 9 states, 106 contain antibodies.  Would odd thing ever say that. never enough people guess… would work less noted UK studies, studies based data AZ heavily used? gives antivaxxers, antimaskers, conspiracy theorists something falsely claim persecution over, perhaps. seem love drama. Feels great. Yes awful winters sometimes, least fewer selfish idiot plague bearers around afford say majority thinking like you. majority population would decided get vaccinated, luxury say ""My risk getting virus super low, feel safer following safety protocols getting vaccine."" Ok  Haha 29 people downvoted. 29 clue. Got second dose Monday dealt effects yesterday. chills fever dealt heat flashes. Lasted day alone side effects wasn’t horrible. Feeling better today dealing slight fatigue. You’re moron, got it.  happened living fear?  It’s season hopefully aren’t much. Yeah pretty selfish want science experiment global knee jerk reaction.

How thoughtless think personal convenience. 

If scared keep kids home home schooling. people like wearing helmet drive car. impact me, mind makes feel safe? even catch jabs 

If go cases alone could seriously end eternity mean that's good article says:

""Our work done time [original Wuhan variant dominant, [and] efficacy might different currently prevalent variants,"" B.1.1.7 Delta strains, said. Yes yes, 1 80 chance hospitalised it, around 1 1000 young. 
Stop fucking fear mongering wasn't, initially local decision simplicity's sake. Last summer wanted indoor transports dense area. complained either complicated healthy remove put one's mask several times (people throw away mask every time remove stepping outside bus put new one).

So stick rule cities: leaving home? masked. take care transplant patients patients Crohns/colitis. Unfortunately vaccine isn’t “taking” people immune suppression. unvaccinated people higher risk people. Also people unvaccinated, higher risk mutation (although think variants unlikely happen US likely happen country without vaccines). 
Also people taking valuable medical resources. likely paying care higher insurance costs taxes. also know several nurses doctors PTSD last year. 


So reasons care advocate everyone get vaccinated. I’m saying vaccinated suffer people. frustrating almost every case covid US right preventable people got vaccinated. enough breakthroughs many unvaccinated individuals stress protection vaccinated have. ultimate boomer, sterile pointless vacation.

They're literally floating hotel. What's point. people like in-laws never anywhere except 20 mile radius town born think went somewhere exotic. Disney Myrtle beach even consider vacation. MIL grand idea road tripping see *gasp* Mount Rushmore Thank response appreciate it! heard Pfizer might issues delivering doses, anyone valid information it? country currently vaccinating people Pfizer like crazy 1-2 million day. want Pfizer time comes bit worried left sinovac. Dont mind two moving Europe Sinovac approved EMA. mRNA vaccines effective prevent hospitalization data available whether host get infected still spread virus. 

This absolutely true. There's multiple studies large samples demonstrating mRNA vaccines highly effective blocking infection entirely. anyone explain can't find anything anywhere subreddit Australian report bats viral studies humanized rats Wuhan Institute? even r/worldnews Make sure paracetamol (if necessary), food drink on-hand day after! unlucky pretty bad. scientific compare different trials

Actually that's exact opposite I'm saying. I'm saying extremely scientific analyze things conditions ideal. used data ideal conditions, science even exist!

But actual seem interested conversation interesting topic clean data useful (which relevant degrees way). seem prefer degree wall instead actually discussing thoughts, ideas, content interesting topics degrees cover insult anyone attempts discuss ideas you, I'm going bother talking further. advice actually plenty learn topics even degree them! could be: look sick people, France UK similar populations, UK 188 people listed critical, France currently nearly 2,000. Noone cares part Schengen Zone, also countries Europe already allowed Americans (croatia, Greece, etc). means Americans easier time transiting different countries zone. Less testing could also less sick people look test (and less close risk contacts test well), testing capacity issue anymore many countries Offer hatch chiles, balloon ride, baggie blue meth get rest here, got Moderna vaccine Air Force base. told best microchips there! still know unvaccinated people priority group 3. I'm group, fortunately I've offered Moderna. Vaccine availability still seems patchy. places get want, particularly tricky get Pfizer age group AZ/J&amp;J recommended. I'll take chances. good enough reason anyone require vaccination?

Should goal mandatory herd immunity children 12 already vaccinated children 12 vaccinated end year?

I'd say no. handful boomers choose vaccinated die care. That's problem mine.

The number children 12 US died COVID insignificant way since COVID discovered. Same. good news. rate rising quite slowly. Critical cases risen around 130 180 UK 4 weeks, France (with similar population size) currently nearly 2000 critical cases.

The delta variant already present spreading Europe. Make children wear masks. children school teachers vaccinated, difference teachers wear masks? son goes summer camp every year, even last year. First week open year 25 counselors tested positive.

A. asshole(s) sent kids knowing sick.

B. get freedom choice, hell vaccinated employment requirement (I always thought would go every year, first grade - 12th, I'm considering requesting refund year finding something else).  Cruise ships variables effect options. main one they're typically moving around multiple countries often going wildly different regulations vaccination statuses. lived island Caribbean would feel differently ship full fully vaccinated tourists showing vs unknowns.

The thing would concerned vaccine crew members able get. vaccinated home countries may ended Sinovac significantly less effective reducing symptomatic cases mRNA vaccines Americans received. get land based resort face wrath merciless Poseidon though think covers huge percentage reddit posters. lol Correct. yes absolutely right, looking hospitalizations, UK currently rising European countries it’s plummeting.

The situation seem slightly worse moment UK continent.  Half damn country refusing, herd immunity never happen. vaccine there, within months made available anyone age. point can't let crowd drive boat. author article bit ingenuous. 

She moved FL open policies allowed pursue chosen career. FL allow restrictions cruse ships afraid people cruise without them, would prefer work cruise ships.

The latter incorrect, awfully selfish. laws tailor make life better?  thought protecting children.... Nobody 12 get vaccinated say hell open everything back precautions? I'm trying argumentative truly understand people's stance this. Ah yes.. living india know reality.. need listen guy reddit understand reality..

India faults.. nobody denying that.. using one them.. Don’t get wrong love going resorts like sandals beaches feel like cruises super convenient way travel especially 3 young children there’s do. mention find cheaper long run spend 10k cruise separate adjoining cabin vs 20k resort amount time. something everyone do, little ones go camps want wife go dinner thing. require minimal planning deciding ship want want go. You’re aren’t stuck trying find something town week straight bounce 6 different islands 8 days. There’s ton different food options, activities onboard don’t feel like like getting days sea. There’s always casino walking distance nice &amp; tons entertainment options. I’ve never cruise blast honest. Oh, right. meant excluding exceptions transit, schools, etc.

I meant counties become full alignment State. can't speak works Germany, got EU passport recently definitely like described. point ever acquiring submitting vaccine cards doctors get QR Code. registered vaccination via online portal required register create account social ID number verified local tax office. created ""trusted profile"" also links tax profile.

From able register online vaccination. vaccination location, someone updated profile generated QR document profile accessed online.

The process (Poland) seems pretty streamlined secure. Hey that's alright guy want ignore science upsets 

Just time stop spreading misinformation publicly got second dose yesterday, 24 hours sore arm slight 99.4 fever dizziness, bad though. 28m  I'm kind sad went trouble used places. :( Woow, amazing rate! prevention new infection among population really important vaccination process record, ""vaccine causes infertility"" fears traced back *Facebook post*. scientific data suggesting mRNA vaccines effect fertility.  Buy local, make less things. western lifestyle literally suffocating us all.  Insanity. Im Healthcare. told needed get vaccine injected via penis intra-orally, would made sure use best anti-dry mouth wash prior appointment. fact people line shit immediately...that schedule brother appointment...that skipped...then got virus week later exposed whole family...the fact people taking time...is fucking mind boggling failure past generations country every way. feel sad country see us falling within twenty years due ignorance apathy people. say like everyone get vaccinated point time that's true. really sick people saying oh well screw get vaccinated fault nobody 12 ability get vaccinated. people seriously selfish? think conclusions made absence perfect data, much discuss guess. say cruiseship ""an outbreak""? vaccine doesnt work? fact saying opposite. vaccine works need obsess going back get second, different vaccine. virus stay, boosters developed keep virus. Wait booster several months figure then.

I'm quite literally saying thing youre putting strawman argue like implication virus spreading among vaccinated people. admit known expected phenomena. Again, posted link CDC website; current guidance consensus vaccinated individuals less likely spread virus fact remains so.

On one end, say “with vaccination - Covid like everyday cold mild symptoms. get eventually.” flip side, worry getting infected breakthrough case gets hospitalized. 

To fair, believe data show far people get hospitalized flu prior years vaccinated breakthrough Covid infections vast majority vaccinated individuals mild cases. knows. I'm vaccinated. carry mine me. walk place employees wearing it, I'll put on. skin back. 

It-literally-doesn't-hurt-anyone.  chart say roughly 75% breakthrough infections reported aged 65+, deaths aren’t broken age. Probably safe assume mostly 65+ well. 

I don’t mean imply scary; deaths expected. vaccines clearly work well, cause panic; everyone get vaccinated. 

However, also magic 100% immunity bullets. I’ve seen lot people sub erroneously claiming one died covid fully vaccinated which, unfortunately, true. 

~500 deaths however many million fully vaccinated individuals (so far) infinitesimal amount, small caveat way knowing many individuals actually exposed covid since vaccinated. Chris Paul Covid reason exactly arguing against. find source reliable data, please let know.

You able become skeptical vaccines live age horrible diseases, Covid much worse, ravaged populace constantly.

Absolutely not, instead training natural immune system non-lethal non-disease causing portion pathogen. get benefit trained immune system without risk death months long hospitalization actual disease. people died recently getting vaccine, why?

No medicine 100% without risks. Especially vaccination program entire populace, rare side effects, even death, result. Instead, able understand risk benefit ratio risk disease catching disease vs. risk side effects. many orders magnitude less risk take vaccine. example, US, one death due blood clots Johnson Johnson vaccine, 7 hospitalizations, among first 7 million people got shot. 7 million people get Covid, expect something like 35,000-70,000 deaths. Maybe 100% would get Covid next 1 year so, nobody got vaccines, possibly least 1/3 people would get Covid, maybe 10,000-20,000 deaths would alternative one vaccination-caused death. better getting vaccine? Yes! people got sick tragedy, level risk similar risk car crash driving highway way get time without antibiotics injected veins would've probably die chocked due coughing back then. probably sound stupid crazy, people truly believe theories.

Weird. Florida hasn’t restrictions fine. wear mask, you’re protecting people around you’re protecting yourself. couldn’t put frying pan lid front face trying prevent bacon splatter, you’d put frying pan.

To wear mask unvaccinated selfish. would love regardless COVID...I'm tired surrounded nutters seems like Gottlieb wants seen main advisor, Fauci seems significantly cutting back public appearances, trying make media appearances every day build reputation. Make vaccine part cure. go hospital covid symptoms way get help take vaccine. Idiots seen people die covid think vaccine something Wait - really? people understand proper donning doffing procedures, people don’t. Forever then? Good luck getting people board supposed doing, parts life. kind mask? would end then? reach herd immunity? That's going happen US anti-vaxers literally one hottest temperature recordings ever taken death valley ca 1913 record searing 134 F (57 C). hottest peak 5 day average 129 F (54 C) Much southern inland california sit sea level mountains blocking air flow California actually warmer many places directly equator. found 9 positive antibody test results 24000 samples tested. 
That well false-positive rate test, which, trust, couple percents.

That's probably false-positive rate \*double\* testing (i.e., retesting positive cases make sure), need check test specifications.

 
One really hopes cases researches know fixed act going public, really can't sure. use amorphous ""find evidence"" instead something definite like ""discovered"" induce confidence.  I've stayed home work minimized outings essential kill someone...I'm US well doesn’t exactly instill much confidence scientists doctors, least perspective, believe obvious reasons. vaccine government mandated, Supreme Court ruling justify that.  reports make lab created theory moot? **New Jersey Update**

Most people slightly less comfortable wearing mask. masked needed save lives, made sense. people vaccinated, everything discourage slightly uncomfortable masks. eradicate COVID.

The Delta variant serious. Here’s rise.
The virus variant caused infections spike U.K. spreading U.S., experts worried.
BYSANJAY MISHRA
PUBLISHED JUNE 16, 2021
9 MIN READ



With vaccination rates slowing United States, countries struggling secure vaccines, public health experts growing concerns so-called Delta coronavirus variant, first identified India March, could trigger dramatic rises cases deaths U.S. world.

The Delta variant already accounts 18 percent cases Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, six percent cases nationwide. already spread 70 countriesand dominant variant India, United Kingdom, Singapore. Last week, Delta caused 90 percent new COVID-19 cases U.K., leading 65 percent bump new infections since May 1. Monday, curb Delta’s spread, U.K. government decided postpone “freedom day,” would mark end public health restrictions.

The Delta variant 60 percent transmissible Alpha variant—first identified U.K.—which turn 50 percent transmissible ancestral Wuhan strain. “It’s super spreader variant, worrisome,” says Eric Topol, founder director Scripps Research Translational Institute. features enable escape immune system perhaps evasive Beta variant (B.1.351) first identified South Africa, worst now, says Topol. “Plus, highest transmissibility anything we've seen far. bad combination.”

Dismayed trajectory Delta U.K., Anthony Fauci, head National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, warned President Joe Biden last week, “we cannot let happen United States.”

The President echoed sentiments, tweeting “Folks, Delta variant—a highly infectious COVID-19 strain—is spreading rapidly among young people 12 20 years old U.K. you’re young haven’t gotten shot yet, really time.” complete dose COVID-19 vaccine still effective preventing serious COVID-19 stemming Delta infection.

Why Delta variant scary?
Freely circulating viruses, especially coronaviruses influenza viruses, encode genetic instructions using molecule RNA, mutate frequently randomly due copying errors introduced replicate human host cells. mutations enable virus evade antibodies; enhance ability infect cell; others go unnoticed since yield benefits even weaken it.

The key Delta’s success collection mutations variant accumulated spike protein, covers SARS-CoV-2 gives virus signature crown-like appearance. mutations changed spike, and, result, existing antibodies may bind tightly often, explains Markus Hoffmann, infectious disease biologist Leibniz Institute Primate Research Germany. Hoffman shown Delta’s closely related Kappa variant evades antibodies generated previous infection vaccination; also resists synthetically produced antibody therapies like bamlanivimab.

The Delta variant mutations spike protein alter interacts ACE2 receptor protein, found surface lung human cells portal invade cell. mutation location 452 spike protein, also present California variants, appears make virus transmissible helps spread population, explains Mehul Suthar, immunologist Emory Vaccine Center.

If mutation gives virus fitness reproductive advantage, mutation tends evolve independently around world. Delta, closely related variants, highly contagious Alpha variant carry mutation position 681 spike protein, thought evolutionary game changer also makes easier SARS-CoV-2 invade host cell spread. mutation fast becoming common COVID-19 viruses around globe.

In addition mutations recent study, peer reviewed, shows variation position 478 Delta’s spike enables virus escape weak neutralizing antibodies. mutation also become increasingly common SARS-CoV-2 variants U.S., Mexico, Europe since early 2021.

“When mutations, start seeing difference infectivity (of virus),” says Ravindra Gupta, professor clinical microbiology University Cambridge, shown unpublished studyhow variants greater potential cause disease.

Vaccines less effective super spreader
The data India U.K. show Delta emerged dominant variant countries within four six weeks. indicates Delta transmissible infectious previous variants. emerging evidence also cause severe disease. example, Scotland caused twice many hospitalizations Alpha variant, already caused severe illness original SARS-CoV-2.

“This combination high transmissibility, high severity, escape vaccines makes Delta very, dangerous variant,” says Deepti Gurdasani, clinical epidemiologist Queen Mary University London. Delta enters country, going spread rapidly. “It's going quite hard contain, likely become dominant variant matter weeks. could change trajectory global pandemic.”

While vaccines still effective severe disease hospitalization caused Alpha Beta variants, offer less protection Delta. People vaccinated one two doses Pfizer vaccine produced lower levels antibodies capable neutralizing Delta variant compared levels generated Alpha Beta. U.K., 31 percent confirmed Delta variant patients needed emergency care received least one vaccine dose.

Similarly, study review revealed doses, Pfizer vaccine showed 88 percent effectiveness symptomatic disease caused Delta variant compared 93 percent Alpha variant. Two doses AstraZeneca vaccine 66 percent effective Alpha 60 percent Delta. single dose either two vaccines, vaccine effectiveness 51 percent Alpha variant compared 33 percent Delta. effectiveness falls 50 percent efficacy threshold FDA set designing safe COVID-19 vaccines; vaccine prevent least half vaccinated people getting COVID-19 symptoms.

In studies still awaiting peer review, researchers report Delta responsible breakthrough infections—which occur full vaccination—in India leading cluster cases among fully vaccinatedhealthcare workers.

There many vaccine candidates rolled around world since agreed international efficacy standards, vaccine might offer varying degree protection new variants. “We need information performance widely available vaccines parts world,” says physician virologist Benjamin Pinsky Stanford University School Medicine. “I think folks need make sure get vaccinated. fully vaccinated, continuing public health intervention important,” says.

A vaccine alone slows progression contagious disease increasing herd immunity. point, preventive measures social distancing masking proven strategies curbing spread virus.

With 44 percent U.S. population fully vaccinated, majority people still vulnerable. Relaxing public health restrictions declaring victory prematurely could provide opportunity Delta variant surge–particularly fall.

A study, yet published, suggests possibility seasonal variations COVID-19 incidence based analyses full year pandemic Europe Israel. virus’s seasonal trends may clear yet, says Topol, know people spend time indoors poor ventilation low humidity virus spreads rapidly.

What happening U.K. could occur many places worldwide. “We keep social distancing vaccination, always possibilities breakthrough infection vaccines still imperfect emerging variants,” says Kei Sato,a virologist University Tokyo, Japan, studying effect mutations transmission Delta emerging variants.

“The variants like spread, especially unvaccinated individuals, viruses mutate eventually pick mutations allow efficient antibody escape. could, theory, make current vaccines even less effective variants.” Suthar cautions.

If don’t take Delta seriously, “there wave U.S. already see fall cases plateaued,” cautions Gupta. Topol agrees ignore variant “we’ll significant rise cases vulnerable areas, hospitalization, pandemic last longer.”  Whoa, care provide site stated that? scientific site, government one. imagine pushback lawsuit two businesses public, even medical religious exemptions. OKkk EINSTEIN Lol Classic Hiding behind Numbers Justify Point. Argument Simple - take Responsibility anyone dies due Side-effects Vaccine. pay Bills. Right? Stop Forcing People Vaccinate themselves. taking Calculated Risk &amp; ready Face Consequences Makes worry toddler… Maryland at? seen anyone without mask yet stores days ago Tracking chip bro. idea talking about, ok. Man sound dumb lol Q. What's got pocketses? A. Covid! “ Pandemic refers epidemic spread several countries continents, usually affecting large number people.” covid subjugated one region/country, defined pandemic. demoted epidemic. still likely going need J&amp;J US get job done. We're past point people showing vaccination sites need start entering realm everyone getting offered vaccine see regular doctor, mobile units vaccinating underserved areas, etc.  Epic  could like nexus cards based RFID, could pretty much scan telling whomever customs whether got vaccine. Went 2 grocery stores yesterday.

At local owned, organic, local produce, high end place, everyone masked inside. like change.

At cheaper, large chain store miles away, 50/50.  


I’m vax’ed choose still mask inside pretty much reasons given:

\- workers still need mask. may customer that’s awkward amount privilege unmasked interacting someone day. 

 
\- unvaxxed people unvax choice. real herd immunity levels reached, still risk. Kids also risk problems variants.

\- may help someone feel better standing next line.

\- I’m vaxxed still catch, carry, spread it. 

\- Breakthrough infections occurring, rare. Vaxxed ppl dying rare still possible. vax side-effects bad enough really want continue avoiding real thing.

 
\- made fabric masks fit well uncomfortable annoying wear.

\- masks block smelling stinky people.

\- don’t trust strangers can’t ID anti-vaxx COVID farmer sight.

I don’t know I’ll decide stop don’t feel mask wearing horrible thing. Others freely choose wear that’s ok.  info J&amp;J vaccine effectiveness Delta/Indian variants others? received J&amp;J vaccine wonder long got wait get one MRNA vaccines? exclusively used word effectiveness every single post I've made.

Dude moved goalposts.

I stand comments. Despite political bureaucracy, still trust scientists CDC working accurate can, less likely be, let's say, muzzled current admin.

The WHO, hand, bow China, unfortunately. countries rely tourism others Masking also overwhelmingly harmless. I’m also Metformin PCOS think I’m sort medical anomaly reverse issue. take daily fiber supplements counteract Metformin.  Thank you. Hopefully things turn around, not, hope comment lesson everyone else bad things :/

If able trade brothers life months isolation masking up, absolutely would. Right, also, know, testing actually really good example explanation. know much vaccines reduce transmissibility? taking *half* Florida here. taking *half* Florida here. male scientists doctors tend care enough female patients actual studies women's bodies.

I thought thing. Okay I'll let know, thanks! don’t get scammed pickpocketed. He's full it. reinfection rate around 0.7% usually milder first. Getting COVID provides pretty good protection. I've Extended Release Metformin years. noticable side-effects.

If taking Extended Release, perhaps give try instead standard formulation? Yeah read that. specific article mentioned 3 approved US, I'm sure headline mentioned Pfizer. Perhaps problem journalists mentioning two studies happening. Frankly headline satisfies curiosity far Pfizer concerned. feel need know every detail every study. family/friends got Pfizer still protected, feel need read further. maybe I'm gonna that's way get details Moderna. think hope vaccine avoidant finally recognize common excuse (""this protect emerging strains,"" etc.) finally put rest. Unfortunately, rationalizations endless make dent recalcitrance. Simple solution, get new parents /s ever hit ball accident? Delta looking like baddest variant we've seen yet. Sounds like sister BIL got bad luck that. Sorry hear it. Russia going release two weeks, tremendous, best data, top scientists coming Russia saying great data is, they've definitely seen. not, actually. Reinfections rare, they're usually mild. Curious medical condition prevents getting vaccinated.

Many prevent full immune response, getting it. am! Thanks lot :) PCOS brutal GI system. US percent positive rate 2 percent. testing means. far fewer sick people needing tested. ninja edit make agree they're 100% effective preventing death (rounded nearest whole number), **but calculation calculate efficacy.**

To is.

So bugger ""I'm going bullshit around efficacy vs. effectiveness"" said efficacy, said calculated initial calculation.

Because efficacy vs. effectiveness difference real world vs. clinical trial.

You suddenly get toss aside control group divide cases population call effectiveness.

And like, mate, look entire post Yes. .0000002 small number matter divide by, end 100% unvaccinated Americans already died COVID, enough us left die move needle 100% effectiveness.

It's total nonsense.

If took time figure number divide .0000002 (sic) order find efficacy effectiveness, would also number lot zeros front it. 

And 600,000? Yeah, number needs SHITTON manipulation order usable 400. Basically impossible manipulation since big factors need account degree spread effectiveness treatments there's basically clean way second factor availability testing massively different throughout pandemic impossible accurately gauge spread way back March. extra leg room wish emphasized even test positive, mean vaccine work, given help guard severe covid, hospitalization, etc. Otherwise people may get impression vaccine work that's case. see upcoming months US south... Seems like common pattern showing expecting everything normal. Maybe they're purposely pushing family members? I'm sure there's lots places could gotten it. 

It's still pretty unlucky, though. haha exponents go brr think good thing approve vaccine without publicly available data? North Korea pretty normal society, bars playgrounds markets normal stuff expect civilized states. PCs mobile phones even becoming common now, except obviously access information strictly controlled.

They huge army, freedom talk freely organize regarding politics, economy rather closed rest world except China. Kim Jong-Un made goal make North Korea like PRC, say, inviting foreign investment develop country internally develop consumer markets resisting pressure political social freedoms. Well vaccinating like crazy us

The UK given 14% doses per capita USA. course immune response better vaccinated, making severity less, breakthroughs happen.

There's things world though pandemic. point, *will* make cut say ""okay, disease harmless enough vaccinated people live risk"". eradicate COVID.

I personally think making bet good one, especially summer. vaccination rates high enough winter, better restrictions keeping real plan. opposite. first shot knocked ass second symptomless. I've reading, seems happen people COVID recovered, meaning mild ""cold"" back March 2020 even lockdown probably it. COVID 19 sars-cov-2 basically thing Expect uptake improve cases rise again, late many. LOL downvotes. 

I’m wary CDC anymore. much WHO. worthless. personally don’t think it’s good put faith institutions. Go ahead live conspiracy world. pass eventual vaccination opportunity, serve example ignorance finally catch whatever variant COVID spreading. 


Meanwhile, walk safely among people ignorant anti-vaxxers. thought airline loyalty program. Ohh Winning Argument Many People's lives got Saved Vaccines. Yes Died Corona even taking Vaccine, Died Side-effects Vaccine hide Facts Carpet &amp; Abuse everyone take Vaccine🤔🙄 I’ll admit, quite weird going maskless first. eventually adjust feels good. However still carry one case someone uncomfortable wants put on. Bavaria, south!

Yes made exactly mistakes uk spread quickly, masks schools without listening warnings. However summer holidays soon start dampening effect taking schools spreading equation (it always effect)

Either way 4th wave come! Either way glad least could get one kids vaccinated first time. full protection september! got J&amp;J'ed early-on community clinic still general lack vaccines everywhere... point sign round moderna pfizer?

I wish little guidance front. I'm worried summer, I'm concerned upcoming winter becomes standard ""covid season"" variants continue pop become dominant. We've heard yearly boosters possibly becoming thing, 9 months (as opposed waiting 12 instead getting booster cold season) early start considering that? I'm sure lot healthcare workers going come month mestones even sooner, too.

I perfectly comfortable J&amp;J initially assumed anti-vaxx resistance would subside pretty quickly. Boy wrong. everybody J&amp;J vaccine, sure herd immunity would probably take over. selfish individual standpoint, definitely wishing one others. fodder deniers.... That's big thing me. I'm immunodeficient, there's year anxiety un-learn. I'll probably still wear mask closed spaces next couple weeks see pans out. mom well. didn’t let inside house. pretty much agree. Chinese-made inactivated virus vaccine. Efficacy seems range anywhere 50% 91% depending data look at. J&amp;J 65%-72%.

Despite questionable overall efficacity, data trial Brazil (like J&amp;J) 100% effective preventing severe cases (that trial 50% efficacy symptoms). pretty good news recipients, necessarily cruise lines want ""no symptoms"" ""no severe symptoms"". really. extra 4 weeks worked/is working tremendously well. EU we're going UK levels delta takes hold here. us sitting around 30% fully vaccinated numbers going fast

Yes indeed uk ahead us 1-2 months areas, whatever happens uk perfect blueprint EU.

And yes vaccinations (Austria) ramped big time, mostly thanks Pfizer almost always deliver time delay fix within next 1-2 shipments. Pfizer really carries vaccination efforts here, now! don’t think Americans really care. vaccinated feel protected haven’t still look recovery number moved 99% even India. Also learned much deaths India due poor unprepared health system didn’t oxygen well society doesn’t believe seeking immediate medical attention. Many doctors India spoke public arriving hospitals way late get promising help. 
Unless Covid moves something deadly ppl becoming numb whole new variants. lot cases vaccines messing menstrual cycles temporarily, yes. temporary. lot data yet though, male scientists doctors tend care enough female patients actual studies women's bodies. Sorry complications - hope well friend! metformin multiple time due insulin resistant PCOS. experience, I’m guessing it’s helps insulin resistance shit Covid along everything you’ve ingested since infancy.  It’s trivial individual level, herd immunity one. 75% population vaccinated, 80% different 95%. use Ivermectin India? many Americans celebrate beginning summer states relaxed restrictions , virus still killing hundreds people daily, nearly unvaccinated, experts say. half Americans protected least one dose vaccine, public health experts say played central role slowing death rate. Deaths Covid declined 90 percent United States since peak January, according provisional data Centers Disease Control Prevention. Wow it’s nice see someone share exact sentiment. agree 💯. Maybe. think that's unlikely, though, stopping spread virus, get lots deaths anyway. everyone going get vaccinated right away.

Moreover, 2 doses would concentrated likely die COVID, 1 dose spread less vulnerable people. Seriously said WTF loud Yes, D614G originated Europe spring, became dominant variant progenitor new greek-letter-variants, Yep! second shot friday saturday *awful*, past couple days great either.

Here's thing, though: I've gone covid, I've deal health complications five months afterwards. I'm *so, so* fucking glad worry happening again. 

Definitely worth it. months late becoming general knowledge want Google you. new CDC study provides strong evidence mRNA COVID-19 vaccines highly effective preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections real-world conditions among health care personnel, first responders, essential workers. analysis study Israeli Health Ministry Pfizer Inc found Pfizer vaccine developed Germany’s BioNTech reduces infection, including asymptomatic cases, 89.4% syptomatic cases sign immune system activity symptoms mean there's system activity. I'd hate Covid spoil even playing dreidel game. Prolong it...for That's get rush abandon masking.

Because breakthrough infections overwhelmingly harmless. That's proxy situation ~2 weeks ago though. Look percentage deaths caused blood clots let alone anything else happened vaccine vs disease causes it. 

I’ll wait. severe response vaccine mean developing antibodies? Sorry I'm assuming obvious/simple answer, I'm someone takes methotrexate manage rheumatoid arthritis recent study methotrexate limits antibody response, wanted ask.

I skipped dose following week vaccine sure times got sick 24hrs. believe in-between 5 week period vaccines also skipped another dose accident, think medicine probably lower body usual.

After second (mRNA), completely felt awful whole day.

I'm assuming fact strong response reassurance probably antibodies...is true? live place antibody tests accessible, unfortunately, I've also read necessarily say protected not. give link that? seen yet, that's great news. people asking ""what J&amp;J??""

It's incredibly important understand narrow scientific studies typically are. Attempting project onto things study get ridiculous headlines ""science contradictory"" rhetoric.

One study might find dark chocolate decreases factor heart disease. Conclusion: dark chocolate reduces risk heart disease! another study finds increases factor - conclusion: dark chocolate increases heart disease! Whereas truth good factor bad another, probably really depends factors personally vulnerable against. 

TL;dr people *shouldn't* asking ""what J&amp;J."" I'm waiting phase 3 trial leronlimab covid long haulers. expand trials sites Texas. I'll try part trial. I've dealing issues since last year wont go away. Merieres fully vaccinated. experience increase symptoms several weeks resolved. Keep mind covid also increase symptoms. hearing loss dizziness permanent--it worth it. India, around World, People died Side-effects Vaccines include Blood Clotting, Oxygen Depletion etc etc. Days ago, Indian govt officially stated Patient died taking Vaccine due Anaphylaxis. decided Blind Facts &amp; Deaths 🙄🤔 know, I've spending lot time ICU lately want anyone else go family gone through. 

The vaccine saved sister's life, sick hospitalized. fine take precautions.

But husband got sick vaccine appointment. He's ventilator. might make it. unvaccinated people life love, I'd advise caution, especially Delta variant going around. live region 70%+ population vaccinated none bullshit happening. sources? would love dig response actually provides good counterpoints. 

What disadvantages running trials parallel? normally done way?

And agree, long term effects may likely, immunity already scenarios risk it? words potential likely response worry me. weighing risks infected transmitting (both unlikely since it) understand correctly, side effects vaccine indeed indication body mounting immune response. opposite true. side effects, likely still protected, immune system kick gear quite dramatically.  Adcovid still saying report phase 1 trials Q2 2021, would still remaining trials eua applications. problem alternatives anyone who's interested getting covid vaccine gotten it. Great news. thing happened Brazil. FDA didn’t allow Sputnik Covaxin first, allowed “small” amount kind test.

They affirmed “allowed” vaccines, can’t attest safety efficacy don’t documents asked for. seems kinda fishy. left dart guns. /s prescribed gap 3-4 weeks depending vaccine, 8 weeks. opposed ignoring numbers. Numbers matter buddy. Eh bad really... know there’s version H5N1 highly transmissible air kills 60% infects? virus released spread world would end human civilization know it. would probably turn effective vaccine wouldn’t you? far torturing confession someone?

So know word torture means. explains lot. 100% far away one offered choice, *fucking torture*. even stupid think making decision extreme physical harm even remotely comparable, *he never confessed.* apparently know torturing *a confession someone* means either.

You apparently know burden proof courts work either. went court burden proof would still prosecution say ""I think it"" sat would bet life savings would found guilty. prosecution still needs prove would found guilty. defense would need show it. like trial ever. matter offered 2 year probation 5 years prison genital mutilation plea deal. got court burden proof exactly would regardless plea deal, plea deal magically change way trials work. can't believe need explain state telling anyone admit guilt risk spending 10 years prison wrong

You *exactly* saying charging anyone crime would require prison wrong. Going trial charge risking penalties. Again, completely irrelevant plea deal is. go trial, risk getting sentence. plea deal 5 years prison instead, still would ""to admit \[his\] guilt risk spending 10 years prison"" according said, immoral. Again, understand understand this.

Your entire argument assuming equally likely innocent person guilty person found guilty. According logic would better force innocent person decide 5 years prison vs 10, instead 2 years probation vs 10 prison. That's completely illogical. rational decision innocent person goes trial gets found guilty time all. case *that's problem.* know think problem plea deal offered think easy innocent person found guilty. again, know keep ignoring this, still irrelevant *the guy guilty.*

Seriously, go back started. Someone said *this guy* played stupid game. went giant idiotic ""what if"" rant innocent people nothing discussed. simple terms, explain *this guy, situation* play stupid game going trial. Otherwise absolutely point made discussion hand. vaccine work agianst new mutation? heard vaccines less effective new mutation less? reach point vaccinated people look like unvaccinated people new type? (infections death rate ) I'm sorry question dumb know mutation viruses works. I'm quite aware importance second shot. I'm also quite aware I'm lasting issues first, doctor confirmed not. can't attach respiratory cells seem like would cause SARS either.  Finally see Pfizer news Moderna? understand similar vaccines haven’t seen many studies mention Moderna. Dude spasms eye arms too. also terrible skin reaction, swollen lmyph nodes, red ring etc. There's definitely correlation matter anti-vax, even gotten first shot lol. Hope feel better man.  Someone posted article comment  old r u? good got one today :) Donated, send batches EU stuff ordered lost fuckup. hell battle lot rural towns. Good luck them. spoke Dr sure correlation. one point read muscle spasms side effect fell realm natural occurrence percentage something nature. 

I'll say got shot left arm within 24 arm's tricep spasms 10 times day 30 seconds clip. that, get spasms over, legs, eye, arms. They're short obviously painful consistency definitely abnormal. There's plenty people described. 

This anti vaxx bs, merely chimed express relief fact one dose well study since one shot. think mean “Don’t let perfect enemy good”. They’re perfect, they’re good, better source information there. Hopefully CDC doubters applying high standard doubt sources information. Everyone age 12 “almost none” now? Smart people! Yeah Amandalorian, Wanda Sykesvision, ""Lo-Key Pandemic giving suicidal thoughts"" THREAT EVERYONE. PROLONG COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION KEEPING EVERYONE, EVEN FULLY VACCINATED PEOPLE, RISK. ALSO CREATE ENVIRONMENT NEW VARIANTS FORM POTENTIALLY EVADE IMMUNITY.

I’m person 4: Disney trip 3 weeks don’t even want cold. wearing cause it’s socially acceptable still…. would worn one back 2019 could without weird looks. UK also currently getting fucked (as UK resident), stuff bad hope sake wait punish you. going it, sounds like still taking proper precautions, many say. increased dosage explain magnetism?

This joke. Don’t ban me. Thank input! guess worry producing sufficient antibodies specific immunosuppressant meds I’m taking highlighted recent study (like 1/3rd patients didn’t). symptom proof body reacting vaccine, right? stories I’ve heard taking meds little/no antibodies, didn’t symptoms. understand doesn’t mean anything general I’m referring taking methotrexate autoimmune disorders. mask prevent catching COVID-19. gaps material larger virus therefore get factual

No, competely false. mechanism action stop virus particles droplets. actually quite effective preventing water droplets leaving entering lungs. droplets one biggest infection vectors. See [video showing masks stop flow moisture mouth. telling effect wearer? course would. would also block droplets inhaled wearer. fauci said way equivalent published research paper

Yes, worse. something told public time crisis. OK scientist lie crisis scientific paper, fact much worse. mean national strategy make best use available doses still short supply. here, respects! “Considering whole population cohort (rather hospital cases), test-negative analysis estimate vaccine effectiveness preventing RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection showed that, compared unvaccinated, least 14 days second dose, BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine) offered good protection: 92% (95% CI 90–93) gene-negative, 79% (75–82) gene-positive.”

It appears didn’t know interpret study. saying vaccine 92% effective protecting symptomatic infection, 79% asymptomatic infection. others, efficacy barely dropped.   idea happen. anyone? Tell know.  trip Germany planned February officially happen, I'm excited!! Oh, I'm sure will. short logic long selfishness. considered asking Dr kind sedative, like valium, take get vaccinated? would two vaccines therefore unlikely cause addiction might help feel comfortable taking it. maybe something like hynotherapy. think needle free ones may take mass produced variants really good idea get vaccinated way can. vaccine quickest I've ever barely felt it. mean that? make kind statement. asked question.

As far I'm aware, nobody knows long term effects. would happy enlightened.

Why share information exists? worried shot fully hydrated. really care dosing schedule.

I spoke doctor days second shot due expressed concerns. pretty dismissive connection said get shot. disagreed.

I get risk variants honestly I'd rather risk another shot spasms already have. age, health one shot reasonable place imo. depends where. I'm MoCo usually one wearing mask. Everyone age 12 currently ineligible, 15% total population Yes, 91% efficacy 88%. drop. Delta Pro Max 2021, waiting Delta Pro Max Ultra +  hope like think work quickly possible. in-person classes fall, worst likely scenario sounds bad.  Ugh, hate hear it. everyone US who's unvaccinated done willingly. Sometimes something else. UK hasn’t got riot 😂😂😂 took 300 years eradicate smallpox 

What want pandemic last long 

Sorry no, gotta draw line point theory came bat driven by? mean charge “forest” would worse off. 

Maybe, come present 'forest scientist' take public jerk “truth” whatever think someone lies achieve desirable end result, sure it’s lie, ends net positive society.

First action actually result net good. eroded trust medical system made anti-maskers feel justified. flip-flopping one biggest reasons Americans refused wear masks. lies disasterous consequences. since lie one trusted him, coordinate pandemic response. way action actually resulted greater good. guess truth important society’s well-being, it’s good thing you’re charge people’s lives.

You misunderstanding politican scientist. politician lie, yes, sake people. scientist lies longer scientist. say may true, true Fauci scientist. one respect scientist. merely politican science background.

In case, hate lie presents himself. presents objective lying. Again, harmless. eroded trust medical system. I'm sure huge percent refuse vaccines remember earlier lie. really think lying good long-term strategy pandemic? trust necessary, throw away? Europe, year's stats lagging last summer's fall 5-7 weeks. Europe barely come last spring's max. overall majority across US. Def western world majority extremely small number, almost none. absolute contraindication history anaphylactic reaction vaccine one components. Even there’s good chance take one alternative vaccines doesn’t ingredient. people don’t mount effective immune response they’re immune suppressed, it’s likely they’ll get extra doses, doses. medical procedures treatments may require careful timing vaccination maximize effect (ex: chemotherapy, surgery). end life patients may decline vaccination, eligible vaccinated. Unlike masks “medical exemption” isn’t really thing vaccine, except extremely small number people highly allergic available vaccines. actually unlimited

Great. great. travel country flying time soon really care. bodies reaction important jumping plane. experiencing multiple pandemics time everyday definition? hahaha I'm reason 100% relate. kind doctor one visit considered this? would it? Lab workers hospitalized symptoms November. Delta (B.1.617.2) variant? Portugal [~60% roughly 3 weeks ago. probably around 90% now. point, make cut say ""okay, disease harmless enough vaccinated people live risk"". eradicate COVID. 
 
Without restrictions vaccination rate would 90% avoid runaway assuming Delta dominance. Last summer Europe total cases started rise late June - early July, right summer solstice sped arrival autumn. year, Europe 5-7 weeks behind last year's summer lows, even vaccinations. 
 
The least amount least time restrictions needed case zero tolerance policies. Lax policies costly terms restriction levels restriction durations. Oh, I'm sure mostly economics based, things definitely start opening, like 25% 100% masks seems happening. think issue would large proportion population vaccinated yet still spread

*despite* vaccines. will, course, harder battle virus spread mutate fully vaccinated population, feeder pools unvaccinated people exacerbate things.

I mean taking argument extreme, vaccinate accept even higher death toll? I've lost people know shitty disease, harder talk dismissively killing 2% whatever know two young families growing fatherless now. Hard co-sign! Thank reading article. you’re US you’re really middle pandemic though, would consider tail end Delta different. drops infection prevention 95% 78% severe cases 99.9% (whatever actual value is) 90%.

I'm sure 78% sterilizing immunity level asymptomatic level. longer faith I'm majority anymore...if look vaccinated percentages they're mostly 50% US think breed underlying conditions? matter do, there’s way get race humans perfectly healthy time. Get eugenecist shit here. think may forgotten say ""among unvaccinated"" understanding present India even Delta gained ground, linked treatment covid (such steroids) covid. first articles coming India claimed related poor home care lack medical monitoring (which explains saw India US peaks, related Delta necessarily high cases home treatment). 

That said, understanding medical expert. Yup. used work cancer hospital admin HR department, I'm medical expert ever. hospital, many patients immunocompromised. Prior Covid, careful is, since something like flu literally kill them. staff, want get annual flu shot, needed wear face mask time. color sticker badge - needed visibly displayed times told people whether inoculated not. caught walking around hospital unvaccinated, unmasked - employment agreement terminated serious. Measles concern NYC well due communities vaccinating, along every contagious disease.

For leukemia patients undergoing bone marrow transplant, live self imposed bubble since common cold kill them.

Covid one many concerns immunocompromised. specified mRNA vaccines, number believed 96%.

Remember read efficacy numbers. *reduction risk*. hospitalization rate unvaccinated individuals ~5%. vaccinated, risk drops 96% that, 0.2%. (If young, base 5% rate large overestimate risk less 0.2% old enough, 5% rate underestimate, risk could still 1% range).

The risk death drops even further.

For people, numbers good enough able resume living way want live--seeing family, going eat, etc. Welcome machine Guess im days behind Living society normally. I'm vaccinated absolutely logical reason wear mask. live city 7 day avg four daily covid cases. totally board masks made sense. think data misinformation, interpretation 2 vaccinated passengers contracting covid outbreak stretch. I'd argue opposite, fact 2 passengers entirely vaccinated cruise ship got infected strong evidence vaccine works nobody else contracted spread beyond one individual. small number breakthrough cases cruise ship also line real-world numbers vaccine breakthroughs, expected rare. know, vaccinated passengers got source spread other. varying levels infectiousness, equate infectiousness level fully vaccinated infected individual one unvaccinated infected apples oranges. So… moderna need take another shot :( Remember Golgafrinchan civilization collapsed turned actually needed people sent away B ark. Honest question, like cruises much especially comparison like ""pre packaged"" vacation completely customizing one yourself?  still get kids sick. Kids can't get vaccinated yet. writing OpEds profitable.

Not sarcasm. 100% effective preventing death, far vaccines go, one best ever. everyone got covid vaccine flu vaccines, flu would kill lot people covid. HartVanNederland TV show, probably representative sample group. better source opinion I&amp;O Research, [their recent also showed “no masks” people (67%) look forward to. EU definitely race vaccinate Delta spreads, however, newest data several regions Germany quite grim: apparently Delta already 10% Bavaria. Yes. Comparing *that one particular stat* meaningless. Along degree television repair whatever nonsense tried use qualify authority matter 

Call names want. going change fact. Let's keep scientific anybody talking about. J&amp;J option, 100% take it. said differences efficacy meaningless, utterly insane. individuals choice, better better, end of. don‘t understand much contagious variants before. ‚limit‘ contagiousness? mean, wild type contagious flu strains. Then, British mutation said 50%-70% contagious wild type. Now, delta variant seems 70% contagious British mutation. even possible? mean might get variants eventually contagious basically infect every meet whatever amount time? happened flu strains? \*One\* person dying receiving vaccine mean vaccine effective. source also appears nothing India besides person traveled there. Blatant disinformation. think new aspect research drug used. used patient develop antibodies. usually supposed used patients risk complications soon diagnosed.

In case appears used much later stage patients failed develop antibodies. gave impression ""100"" would likely died without treatment, saving 6% sounds good case. perfect, 6% would appreciate sure. segregate people different. /s Pfizer greater production capacity therefore prevalent world wide US. Additionally, Pfizer - somewhat brilliantly - gave extra doses Israel exchange data sharing there’s country essentially test lab future potential issues vaccine. K big. Good job Turkey. Respect Thailand. data = permission. Needless fear-mongering. hospitals relying biologics treat immunocompromised patients caught COVID prevent developing severe case dying?

Total shambles. Boosters fall coming.  aren’t getting fact anti-mask, anti-restriction stance exactly never end. 

This could started weren’t people like yourself. Wait. got pregnant? That’s hell vaccine side effect. think that's exactly comparable. Afaik UK vaccinating certain age groups, current wave mostly people simply chance get vaccine yet.

Probably really similar variant. think original ""dead"" since winter recall. [study catching covid. shot. Probably smoking *while* getting shot. They’ve posted subs they’re afraid it, posts knew failure troll. That's anybody talking about. J&amp;J option, 100% take it. said differences efficacy meaningless, utterly insane. individuals choice, better better, end of. Don’t scared. You’ll fine. also likely means 1-shot strategy (for instance UK did) bad idea countries going forward variant spreading. need protect then. Life isn’t fair. can’t stop society protect fraction percent people fit description. Sorry. Sure research saying two doses 86-96% effective hospitalization Delta variant. 

Hospitalization fairly big deal, think? heard fraud medical masks, ones wear shops. Wooo mostly spread delta variant. Let's say US 50% delta variant 50% US EU weeks behind at, let's say 10%, similar level cases (they equal right now), think US considered ""safe"", significant risk importing additional delta variant cases. 

Also, think there's chance increase cases US, like UK. First of, US overall less vaccinated, terms partially vaccinated fully vaccinated, UK. UK rapidly increasing protection, US relatively basically standstill. UK rise cases higher levels vaccinations, prevents rise cases US? top that, certain areas, mostly rural, level vaccinations extremely low US. often combined restrictions (or following them). there's basically almost nothing preventing COVID-19 rise due Delta variant areas. thing hope spread limited due low density. remind waves last autumn/winter states like Iowa, North South Dakota. saw extremely high level cases, rural. seems protection COVID-19 due density great. gullible plebe got J&amp;J. vaccines FAR better none. mRNA vaccines edge efficacy, viral vector vaccines still effective. technologies effective much easier manufacture traditional vaccine technologies used annual flu shots. Personal anecdotes calculated vaccine built SARS research works virus research based on?

What surprise. I'm sorry hear that. hope get go somewhere safe. Bro it’s allergies 😂 Well screw them. It’s don’t want vaccine, I’m moving life. real! 🤷🏻‍♀️ gosh. kids! one, experience, ever implied two doses effective variants. much strawman.

I respectfully disagree. Every day, see people explicitly arguing vaccines losing enough efficacy vaccinated Americans need put guard again. Delta variant becoming dominant strain around world preying people. need understand variants concerning them. applies Americans.

Yes, part first sentence don’t think it’s fearmongering aware variants. Full stop. covid going around original strain variants? also, throw masks garbage, shit OVAH.  basically India went wave population load virus strain r0 = 7? 
Thats scary! let AMC see this, bet ass make spin off.   I'm glad think people dying languishing joke laughed need people taking shot people arguing vaccinating 

People remote areas need access alternatives, example “Mutations”/variants aren’t legitimate reason keep things reopening. Besides, mutations happening without us reopening given virus still running rampant much world foreseeable future, vaccinations short supply. considering negative news development drugs treating covid, yes vaccination way it. hope cities ban cruises. certain point need try reopen. cases low they’ve entire pandemic, deaths dropping, anyone wants vaccine get one. 

At point, can’t continue shuttle economy concern something isn’t materializing. watched, yes, can’t stay locked scared forever, especially cases, deaths hospitalization rates supporting COVID major threat US anymore. Vaccines work, let’s give chance prove do. thing vaccines provide good bit protection natural immunity. Especially new variants involved. using nonsense language respond me. 

I truly laughed hard attacking Muslim typical islamophobic nonsense wordings. Well, Israel far done. seem run quite high level vaccine hesitancy. goes US, swimming vaccines run people willing get vaccinated. given Turkish government screwed Coronavirus response consistently, day day, 16 months now, happy poor citizens least able get decent vaccine. ever accepted idea viruses contracted outdoors? whole wearing masks outside locking parks hiking trails nothing fear mongering beginning. US vaccinated 150 million people, fully vaccinated people far 400 died.

The vaccine 100% effective preventing death. percentage people can't get mRNA vaccines basically zero. percentage people recieved mRNA vaccine long term health problems zero.

If live US COVID over, access vaccine vaccinated people COVID less deadly flu, less deadly common cold.

Convince care adult chooses skip vaccination? Sorry factually incorrect figures.

Pfizer 96% effective hospitalisation 2 doses Delta variant. 

AstraZeneca 92% effective hospitalisation 2 doses Delta people support argument playing kind ""what if"" game. paralyzed could happen actually happening needs happen. argument endpoint zero Covid, impossible due never get vaccine. Covid likely endemic (with reduced potency) we're going learn live without restrictions. Otherwise, rolling lockdowns never end. want live way anymore believe majority people point would agree. found test &lt;0.8 means detected, 0.8-1.2 medium result means detected IgG IgM. Dude reality India. words members parliament, Hinduva members covering cow dung drink cow urine.

The problem, despite nonsense numbers big enough government react start campaign stop it.

So put blind siding national pride asside see problem danger given us deadly delta strain virus dominating world right now. current vaccines ~30% affective against

Stop anti-vax propaganda. No, simply matter luck. I've read Fosun chose different variant Pfizer's pre-production performed poorly phase III. readjust production line.  stop this? Seriously news outlets getting control now. Except maybe Victoria. Poor buggers

They cheat like rest Australia. ok cheat viruses. confirm makes hard take young child anywhere.   105 tomorrow, 113 Thursday, 108 Friday Sacramento Valley. Brutal. delta variant going give us trouble. I'm bit worried it. really hope actual efficacy higher that. well year people want/need get back lives. point going accept living virus. Watch out, VT climate south Québec, except almost one speaks French. weird place. see exponential growth more. many people vaccinated many ""natural immunity"" wont happen.  determined second time cold? curious, since mild COVID cases typically present cold.

Right? vaccine attacks actual virus itself. unless virus somehow mutates finds way enter cell wall without using spike proteins safe variants. would hope well, starting fully vaccinated + 2 weeks course. Yeah, makes sense. I'm still bit sceptical everything going great sudden maybe happy haha. Yet world bought fords could mass produce it, like Pfizer mass produce mRNA vaccines. That’s fine it’s gonna fairly difficult lie &amp; get away it.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Currently not. Germany it’s yet decided people like get second booster dose. mention Johnson Johnson vaccine somewhere around 70% effective whereas phizer Moderna vaccines around 90% effective original strain. I'm sure effectiveness lowered drastically delta. keep lockdowns going summer. flu season rolls around winter call something else. Everyone line food ration. Make sure wear vaccine armband. Thanks clarification. I’ve seeing 88% number around today didn’t know infection hospitalization rate. Thanks. Maybe explain Boris Johnson. could saved UK another week lockdown. Probably today, daily record change lol I’m surprised it’s low

Although would say truth something like survey like kinda odd [**Public Health reporting 92% efficacy 2 doses AstraZeneca world data PHE, published pre-print, demonstrated two doses COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca 92% effective hospitalisation due Delta variant showed deaths among vaccinated. vaccine also showed high level effectiveness Alpha variant (B.1.1.7; formerly ‘Kent’ variant) 86% reduction hospitalisations deaths reported.*

*15 June, 2021* many lied survey, saying would lie, would. course does. formal education probably, even it, worth sh*t. feed FUD 24/7, end like that.

Don't try reason people. figure prone believe anything truth. ignore them. Man container shipping wasn’t backed enough :( trials cannot tell efficacy deaths hospitalizations. enough cases. real life roll-out say it. 

The CDC saying Pfizer vaccine 94% effective hospitalization adults 65yo older: might studies, data takes collected, specially falling numbers. 

Now. Keep mind S. America dealing Brazilian P1 Gamma variant, vaccines expected show lower efficacy. Massive failure Indian leadership. literally worse case scenario. don’t understand Indian people don’t kick Modi trash start fixing mess. 

There countless things could’ve done. Modi’s case, done, like political rallies rest world social distancing. asshole blame party lives lost

You believe assholes (Modi crew) approved Pfizer/Biontech vaccine now; even going worse case COVID world

Come one people’s lives stake put giant walls around bats reservoirs area let bat things without humans able interact all? put fine $1million anyone dares step foot inside reservoir. sweat it! first dose went ok, 2nd one put ass days. 3rd day felt great! I'll tell this, nothing felt better I've never felt relief got 2nd dose. able get another dose anyway? so, it? Cdc.gov explains it. Jan. 25, 1919, nearly 2,000 San Franciscans showed Dreamland Rink public meeting Anti-Mask League” 2nd year 1918 flu worse first, reasons India’s second year worse. Variants, fatigue, hubris. History science ignored high costs. easy spot relation, hard conclusive evidence. Difficult topic. Biontech developed Pfizer’s produce mass. end don’t care outside Germany calling Pfizer vaccine. Number 14 would Xi. dare keep rule   Johnson &amp; Johnson: Probably Fine™ Sometimes matter science, communications' approach. there's 60% chance right, say? Maybe wrong worst case scenario means people lose trust you, say know. Maybe want prepared worsening situation, say needed. Im even gonna argue statement. Considering theres side effects every medication. downvoted truth. media absolutely trying keep fear porn going, particular using statistics mislead. saw recently Toronto headline ""covid cases 30 cohort 80%!!!!"" one really search see yes, went 10 cases 18, 80% correct also highly misleading (which point).  Jha says article there’s data needed J&amp;J he’s confident health effects outside random acts god. Side effects? Come man. Stop legitimizing selfish, stupid behavior.  Money following closely— maybe someone answer questions?

Is black fungus showing greater rate people COVID? it’s increasing people COVID, people Delta variant? people using steroid treatment control COVID?  countries reopened Americans yet. want travel one country another Americans vacation often do. understand right, also means Americans provide proof vaccination negative test country entering (still might airline though). Yeah Ontario government decided best way handle pandemic absolutely decimate small/medium businesses entire province. Person lived USA Pretty much everyone UK calls Pfizer vaccine. Wrong  incredibly virulent (even vaccinated folks spreading it, evidenced recently)

Huh? evidence recently? Where? No… promise it’s America taste smell still exact 7 months ""Pro lockdown states"" going shit they're also ""pro vaccine states."" anti-vax states going ones issues, also going shit. Nothing going change besides anti-vaxxers getting sick  Excuse Moderna…? also research PR like Pfizer?? Islam, Christianity Judaism became one?

You seem problem understanding difference theology ideology philosophy. say 'brand new' - article received 15 April 2021 per footnote link nature.com, mention Delta variant India, first one ever seen labeled 'Variant Concern' data source suggest there’s plateau? 

If look [government cases simply isn’t true, much would like plateau/ reducing. DELTA name misleading keep thinking cancel fights????

What Variant strain actual name? would go Moderna? They're there. Someone brought friend pharmacy covid shot asked driver ""what you? need one?"" like ""uhmmmm yeah probably huh?"" Guess casual offer it. There’s literally link containing J&amp;J information within article. That's point. think realistic stay lock case yet UK still safe travel list... wtf variation effectiveness vaccines different variants large enough make difference real world. vaccine 85% effective instead 95% variants significantly statistically, real world, it’s essentially trivial since anything 60% effectiveness enough large enough portion population vaccinated.

Also, vaccines slightly less effective preventing mild asymptotic cases variants remain close 100% effective hospitalization death. everyone like that. Got couple people know definitely think exists took safety precautions. think vaccine hasn’t tested enough mess fertility.

So definitely anti-vax, way feels like could convince eventually get shot. monitor antibodies? go doctor's office, insurance cover this? kids got sick daughter got pneumonia. wrong. unknown affects later lives, particularly daughter. 

Wished death? say that? said antivaxxers go hell. Get right. figures show doubled incidence one week, hardly Rt around 1. course numbers low get technicalities.

I think end Delta become dominant everywhere emerges, way control way control every variant: vaccinate fuck away. USA calls Pfizer USA, Pfizer manufacturing, distribution, clinical trials, data analysis, etc. Unlikely I'd say. Janssen least communicated made effort deliver unfortunately throw away tens millions doses due contamination. Astra Zeneca even capacity ready deliver. Yes course. agree sure. Shh, stoke enough anti-Chinese sentiment US people saying sensible things like that? disagree. Donald trump don’t anything start help curb, support curbing, spread coronavirus none would bad was. California acted right away. Shelter place, mask mandates, work home. Summer seemed like shot beating it, free lockdown bullshit. 25-50% country though brain washed believing virus fake, China made lab. hoax November would go away election. virus slow andy steady. Killing hundreds, thousands, every day. segment population continued spread it. November way worse ever allowed get. centers won’t get vaccine, willfully allowing coronavirus spread. 

Those people ones holding us captive. refuse listen reason science lockdowns, trail corpses stumbling economy consequences. still get spread it. Traveling spreads don’t want get much ELI5 would imagine different vaccines different cars. essence delivering thing delivery affects % effectiveness.  There's reason let vaccinated people travel.  can't get vaccinated? constraint I've heard specific allergy Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) Polysorbate (vaccine ingredients) kids 12 approved yet. 
 
 
The CDC say anyone else can't get vaccinated. heard otherwise? worst government extended restrictions month right cases began plateau cases inevitably start drop (as going regardless) claim saved day.

And I’m saying restrictions useless it‘s really secret anyone Boris Johnson cares public image well-being people. Dude. 

Bruh. 

Second sentence article. good news vaccines variants continues roll in. **Last week, study reported Johnson &amp; Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine protected SARS-CoV-2 variants concern.** Now, Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine shown protect several SARS-CoV-2 variants well. 😂  Children never risk, wishing death fellow citizens personal medical decisions evil Gottlieb trying audition Fauci’s replacement? he’s news cycle pretty much every day Fauci seems phasing public appearances It’s Americans calling Pfizer’s, sub US-centric thinks everyone else world calls like that. dropped Denmark. Tobacco ! took first jab today AstraZeneca.  Cytokine storm happens strong immune systems, weak/strong isn’t relevant virus. Yeah everybody (in US) required get mumps vaccine.  I’m thinking we’ll likely need booster shots year, maybe get Pfizer update then. 

Or

Just like people COVID, recommend waiting least 3 months infection get vaccine — maybe wait 3+ months JJ vax get Pfizer. atheism devolve anti religion? Marxist? hope so. Getting sick people paranoid Thanks actually reading study. work education, poor kids coming broken homes attended class year, despite needing learning supports. important learn read reduce chance sick person dying, impossible way *Most people US.


There. Fixed ya. Doesn’t mean it’s rational. Go look numbers. They’ve plateau since June 9 meaning it’s likely gonna start going back within week most. actually change anything? bunch EU countries letting Americans already. Pfizer testing 10mcg ages 5-11 compared 30mcg 12+. Ages 6m-5yo testing 3mcg. 

I believe moderna 30 50mcg age 2-11 testing adults receiving 100mcg.

I guarantee many parents would choose 10mcg Pfizer given option. J&amp;J still important single shot &amp; easier store. big hurdles less economically robust areas. Trust me, dont want ""help"" Apparently people still freaking though “Pandemics us centuries,” Novartis CEO Dr. Vas Narasimhan said CNBC Evolve Global Summit. 
 
“We know solutions — hard maintain investments time,” added. 
 
Narasimhan said topic future pandemic preparedness discussed health ministers biopharmaceutical executives G-7 health minister’s meeting earlier month. Around 12 million 55 million Q2. Slightly increase stabilizing week already. They’ve already plateaued. vaccines job.   Probably since deliveries likely impacted hold doses Beltimore plant I’m pretty sure aware preparing possibility ACSH crackpot, conspiracy theorist website that's currently pushing FUCKING ASPIRIN effective medicine covid. actually read MIT study, discuss accuracy covid skeptics. discussed skeptics abilities manipulate data visualizations order appeal public, stressed need actual scientists improve visualizations order appeal general public. sort like ACSH scientific website slightest, understands make website look pretty seem scientific rubes blindly share stuff without actually examining it. still referring original trials? Edit: reading abstract. think rest head lol Thank links. Ive wondering radio silence J&amp;J shot awhile got back March Maybe I'm wrong, feel like vaccines going effective hit point variant different original vaccines going need revising. based origin virus. Vaccines effective variants that’s completely irrelevant.  Hahaha article actually links information J&amp;J first paragraph: Isnt u.k. getting cases? information verified easily. passport “show piece paper”, yes, fraud rampant. odds places least verify clever folks committed fraud find confined spaces high population densities. said bullshit. Car dealerships made bank. Production chips record pace, jobs plentiful, businesses stress demand. Yes, went lockdowns, others hired slack. pandemic nearing end. Get it. vaccines saved us. It’s over. stop living fear. always learn Delusional. Children lost year education, seniors wasted away solitary confinement, people died alone lost things never get back. That's nice dont find restrictions burdensome, must live privileged life able say mean Vincent Price song? got chills fist shot, getting second one Friday. side effects nullified feeling relief. "" childhood needles "" speaks relatable way.  almost doctors different opinions taylor unique needs patients... mask rule introduced really visible infection rate numbers, expect nothing else rule scrapped.

If n95/ffp2 required probably would different. almost doctors different opinions taylor unique needs patients... politics matter regards whether vaccine safe children. eligible population used track vaccination rates, rather total population? statistical medical reason this?

I debating friends. claim PR purposes (eligible population always smaller total population, vaccination rate higher), I'm thinking (hoping?) there's actually scientific even practical (it's easier track/calculate) reason behind it. anyone know long one avoid smoking covid jab ? standard care anyone unvaccinated 60 known risk factors throw positive rapid antigen test. takes 1-2 hours administer outpatient setting. administered early cuts chance hospitalization almost 80%.  hospital stay US averages $30-40K.  post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Everyone's situation unique. Many assumptions made vaccine stupid. Someone posted evidence vaccine impacts fertility, fact anyone would bet house 9 months silly. really hope safety profile ends good sounds, think conclusive answer point foolish. me, immunosuppressed due health problem resulting malpractice. working remotely pandemic started hate going eat. risk getting virus super low, feel safer following safety protocols getting vaccine. religious, consider republican Democrat, medical marijuana card guns. Stop trying put bucket idiots.

TLDR: everyone getting virus trump loving God fearing idiot believe science. us actually first hand experience medicine failed us, making calculated decision hold off....for now. went Croatia last week USA..there travel ban? new bit robust clinical trial data demonstrating works works on.

People given many experimental treatments,but good evidence small number those. dont forget everyones mental physical health well! got diagnosed covid even though got J&amp;J shot April. helps lessen severity covid can't fully prevent getting it. got covid someone vaccinated symptoms. Unfortunately refused wear mask around me.   LMAO. Better protection infections symptoms meaningless, jesus fucking christ. 1 shot Pfizer AZ found 33% effective Delta. plenty reason vaccines 33% effective symptomatic disease B.1.617.2 three weeks first dose, whereas 50% effective  edgy Ok Ok see lot comments like this, think miss one avoiding vaccine might feel rough days, instead might develop myocarditis another serious side effect. 

Also, surprised didn’t keep 15 minutes (as allergy type serious side effects happen almost immediately). They’re strict U.K.  Per CDC: 500 breakthrough infection deaths fully vaccinated individuals (two weeks post second shot) US alone June Time tell us. densely populated areas vaccinated around 60% - 70%. Low-vaccinated areas less densely populated areas spread UK. US may see sudden surge cases UK. Say don’t understand basic science saying it... y’all really understand viruses change, mutate become stronger? Dude basic middle/high school science you’re dumb understand natural selection going come real soon. Ffs even white glue vaccine protects current common strands changes every year.   literally posted link CDC's website. misinformation. Check pandemic fatigue Businesses closed, people got laid work, students struggled learning online...etc etc. …and Oxford-AZ?

I got first dose five weeks ago looking getting second another seven - option switching Pfizer Moderna. don’t comprehend Pfizer vaccine boost AZ. feel like I’d starting over. Hay fever? Regular colds? thing. can't. cruise ship giant petri dish definition. fantastically stupid idea hundreds people ship, massive consumption standards weeks, even people average older less healthy average citizen. ships already massive can't profitable unless overcrowded. constraint variant still needs Spike protein infect human cells. There's limit much change remain infectious. Whether possible changes allow *both* significant immune escape *and* significant infectivity remains seen. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* point evident drama around Sputnik V mostly political. US delay second shot like UK did, think impact US like UK. 30% cases delta variant UK added safe list ? 

[Because 30.  Please look correlation/causation  guy. I'm side man lol   think meant respond person me. Oh realize Delta added variant concern recently. Thanks pointing out! I'm you. seem like 75+% vaccine updates Pfizer? want know Moderna still protecting me. I'm sure people want know J&amp;J still protecting them. would imagine people can't get vaccinated already live lives level risk factored in. likely thing vulnerable too, total numbers decline, Covid another thing them. article quote one interviewees saying,

“While it’s reported paper, done experiments Moderna vaccine got similar results.”

So that's cool! hear lot people sneezing coughing around me. includes myself, got tested came back negative.. wonder another virus that’s detected PCR-tests coincidence. 🧐  like, covering what? anyone suing CDC? even possible? Get mad oligarchs turning us I’d love see info innate immune systems young children. Yeah, we've done great job. I've vaccinated living normal life 2 months now. interconnected now, doesn’t take much. Especially something airborne. Agreed. guess it’ll location specific areas low vax rates. Rural/south It’s “you’re,” professor. current trends stand vaccinations, that's premature assume. states like 30% vaccination, Delta variant proving wildly contagious.

We'll also see summer drop off, looks like seasonality matter. areas set potentially bad fall, that's even assuming get another variant reduces effectiveness vaccines.

In short, people need get vaccinated I've got one (vaccinated) friend caught mumps holiday Brazil. one believed saw photos weird.

Here's hoping see COVID. Yeah apparently they're testing may well end fine right sure feel validated deliberately picked mRNA vaccine avoided appointments places giving J&amp;J out. extra week waiting worth it. headline misleading. referring R0 R number would mitigating measure whatsoever. mention vaccinates mitigation. held captive government oligarchs, fellow citizens. That's good news got first dose Monday. kind getting little nervous got started seeing articles saying Pfizer side effects causing heart problems nice read something positive call ""Thriller"" ""the Rod Temperton song"" either. believe current trials half dose, Mrna know yet whether dosage difference really. know they've testing mixing matching vaccines, they're done that.

If want wait, maybe try sign study? Hebrew… let’s keep biblical didn’t mention delta variant though trying cling power, live life Pfizer vaccine even available India. Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Literally laughed aloud reading this. take vaccine make immune system even stronger avoid people sick( worse) been. disagreeing, think circulating before. would caused sudden surge across entire world? It’d probably smaller outbreaks regions anti-lockdown low vaccination rates. Basically states winging whole pandemic largely didn’t public health measures

Pro-lockdown states might re-implement masks public late Fall/Winter precautionary measure, stress need vaccinated see family holidays safely that, don’t see many restrictions returning states either, barring literal worst case scenario happening. What's ""official"" reason delay? make sense government donating doses people still waiting. attempt explanation? new study re-hashing original data published testing? new data, could share it? hard hard time finding information outside ""60 Million J&amp;J thrown out"" older stories temporary J&amp;J pause. Say two 6 year olds 7 year old (who got pneumonia covid last year).

Stop thinking everyone wants vaccine got one, 12 can't yet probably end August/September. antivaxxers go hell, sure. understand I'm dying get kids vaccines approved yet. Alpha alpha"
