Fever came to that throughout Saturday morning. Woke up with a headache and pain down my shoulders. I slept a lot throughout the day, switched from my PC to my bed, napping, tik tok, movies. No real drive to do anything. I also had a lack of appetite so i ate lots of yoghurt i got purely by chance the day before.

On Sunday i felt better but still like i've been through a wringer. Hunger came back but i was still tired and exhausted from the head and shoulders pain. I also felt a bit puke-ish but after i ate some chicken nuggets i felt a lot better and i think i should've eaten something proper the day before.

I called Monday in sick as i still dealt with a headache and exhaustion and started feeling snively but that was mostly down to the weather getting colder where i lived and my dumb ass generally having at least one window open in summer. But by Tuesday i felt much better.

So, all in all it wasn't weird. I drank tons of water as i was sweating and peeing a lot. I would recommend getting washing towels ready with cool water so you can put that on your forehead and shoulders. Get some salty sticks. Something dry to chew on so you can fight hunger.

&gt;Sigisoara is a lovely semi preserved medieval city if you have time to drive over there.

Awesome, putting it on our list.

&gt;Btw, driving in the mountains with crazy people passing on blind curves is going to probably stress you a bit. 

I grew up in Ireland, so I have experience with small, winding roads. But I've heard Romania takes traffic laws extremely seriously and speeding is zealously policed. Sounds like this may be a false expectation based on your lived experience? Would love to hear more on this point. 


&gt;If you get to Bucharest for any time please consider eating a meal or two at Zexe.  It’s amazing food and prices and it features foods typical of the nobility a couple centuries ago.

I initially am thinking that driving in Bucharest might be a poor choice. Countryside is one thing, the capital is another. But I would love to visit. Maybe we'll drop the car off early and take the train into Bucharest for our last few days.

&gt;I find weird cool buildings to admire while walking around, but it’s kind of hard to say “check this out,” because it’s not cohesive?  I just walked along a portion Dacia blvd today that had *some* interesting architecture for example, but I don’t know if you would want to wander along for that.  Old town is cool, but if you do want to see something different then I can try to refine my walk around the ‘hood list. 

Always love to wander and get lost in historic towns. If you think of any food/event places a tourist would be unlikely to choose but are worth doing that'd be awesome.
&gt;
&gt;I do highly recommend going to the village museum if you think cool old buildings are at all interesting.  They relocated many old structures from across the country, and I love the place.

The only reason we are seeing so many variants is because there are so many infections. If it was at the usual flu level, wouldn't see as many variant:

&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Alphainfluenzavirus are RNA viruses that cause coronavirus disease-19 and influenza, respectively. Both viruses infect the respiratory tract, show similar symptoms, and use surface proteins to infect the host. Influenza requires hemagglutinin and neuraminidase to infect, whereas SARS-CoV-2 uses protein S. Both viruses depend on a viral RNA polymerase to express their proteins, but **only SARS-CoV-2 has a proofreading mechanism, which results in a low mutation rate compared to influenza.** E1KC4 and camostat mesylate are potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, achieving an effect similar to oseltamivir. Due to the SARS-CoV-2 low mutation rate, nucleoside analogs have been developed (such as EIDD-2801), which insert lethal mutations in the viral RNA. **Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 low mutation rate suggests that a vaccine, as well as the immunity developed in recovered patients, could provide long-lasting protection compared to vaccines against influenza, which are rendered obsolete as the virus mutates.**

Think of it this way.  When a spike protein (or anything that's a threat) gets into your body, the body will try to find spots on the protein that it can bind to. Once it finds a spot, it runs off and makes antibodies that on one end bind to that same spot, and on the other end signal your immune system to attack the invader. 

Natural infections have a LOT more spike proteins from all the covid cells  than spikes in the vaccine, so your body has more opportunity to find spots on the spike protein to bind to in a natural infection.

IP and patents in medicine is an issue in general but arguably more so in developed countries like the US. Developing countries already have a mechanism to compulsory license essential medication through the [Doha Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha_Declaration).

In the specific case of this pandemic AstraZeneca at least is selling at cost and there is local production in many developing countries.

In the context of a pandemic, the situation is urgent, and any local production needs the cooperation of the vaccine creators. They also play a role in certifying it, to ensure that it's being produced to their exact standards and it works. I don't believe in this context then that AZ produced in any new country has to go through a new certification process in all the various countries FDAs or equivalent, it's ""AstraZeneca"" in general that has the authorisation and it doesn't matter if it's now made in a different country.

Apart from AstraZeneca and Sputnik, which they are also producing locally, India does also have its own totally domestically developed vaccine, Covaxin. One of the problems with this though is as of yet it's not approved in *other* countries, so it's not necessarily valid as proof of vaccination for example for travel.

CHOs pushed for an end of AZ, because modelling shows we cannot have herd immunity/a safe open using that. Worse, we need to [revaccinate with mRNA to achieve](https://www.policyforum.net/vaccinations-borders-and-the-delta-variant/).

Why? Because delta has a 2 in 5 breakthrough rate against AZ (ie, the oft-repeated 60% protection against symptoms).

So they were asking for 3 politically impossible things:

1. A framework to finance covid zero, ie to get NSW back down to zero.
2. [A plan to end AZ](https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/politics/2021/07/03/exclusive-morrison-ignored-chief-health-officers-advice/162523440011987#hrd), and role out mRNA for all - including those already vaccinated.
3. A reduction in quotas, because lockdowns are invariably costly - and we don't have the facilities to manage quarantine (because they haven't even started building them...).

The easier option, given News Ltd + LNP situation and looming election is the brave, bold strategy:

1. Race against the virus. Any jabs in arms, AZ, whatever you have. ATAGI advice is no longer relevant, as the threat level is a lot higher now.
2. No more lockdowns, no more containment.
3. AZ makes for weaker symptoms, virus can roll out a million infections to provide (hopefully) full immunity quicker than Feds can vaccinate.
4. ""Open by Christmas"".

WA/Vic/SA plan to isolate, and observe. They'll try for less impact through mRNA, as it's coming in spades from October (10mn+ doses/month).

QLD is in a perilous situation - dependent on domestic tourism, multiple outbreaks, no Federal aid to protect businesses - they end lockdown tonight, with minimal restrictions. What happens, happens.

Visibly spitting/screaming post national cabinet, as this was not their preference. Key references include ""we have heaps of Pfizer coming from September, why don't we just wait"" and similar exasperated comments. ""I don't want AZ for all"". It was very much _not_ their pick, but they cannot self finance a fight against this, and are too tied to what happens in NSW.

NSW will delay as long as they can, as every week buys, well, a week. A lot of 1st-shot vaccinations.

Further, it buys time to observe the UK and other places where delta is booming. Never mind the vax+immunity from prior waves, we'll watch and hope we can do similar.

They _may_ move out of this, but they cannot without the Feds financing it. They're the currency issuer, the one that's responsible for welfare and the broader economy. They can fund jobkeeper etc, but QLD cannot turn this back on their own.

So ultimately, Australia will likely be rejoining the world - and in a not too dissimilar end result, despite that we're pretty damn close to getting the mRNA required to prevent this all. It would only highlight Morrison's failures, and this close to an election, that's really not a narrative that can be afforded.

&gt;MELBOURNE, July 3 (Reuters) - Australia's New South Wales state recorded its biggest daily rise in COVID-19 infections this year, even as residents in several major cities across the country were released from snap lockdowns on Saturday.

&gt;Sydney, the New South Wales state capital and home to a fifth of Australia's 25 million population, has been hit hardest in a flurry of outbreaks of the highly contagious Delta variant around the country over the past two weeks.

&gt;State Premier Gladys Berejiklian reported 35 new cases, 29 of which were linked to previous cases. That eclipsed the 31 cases reported a day earlier, taking total infections under the current outbreak to more than 250.

I’m not downplaying the cases or saying it shouldn’t be taken seriously. But the headline ignores that other cities have reopened, that the cases are increased by 4 -35 from a previous 31, and, most of the new cases have been in isolation.

The goal was/is to make Covid like the flu for those that it hurts the most. There was never such a thing as Covid zero. Could people mask up for the rest of their life? Sure they could - there’s nothing that says they can’t or that you can’t - just that a lot of people don’t want to 

For most people though, they want to get back to living their lives. A life that many see face masks as tied to the pandemic. It’s one thing to be cautious - but not to insist that the very things that will end the pandemic don’t work

Your risk may be different than ours that you want to accept. We accept risk in every other part of our lives just by living day to day. It’s just laughable that people said not to long ago to listen to the CDC and now the same people say don’t because they disagree with the guidance

The high number of new cases, relative to recent days, was driven by large-scale testing at three markets in the capital's Wanhua District where the cases have been discovered, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said at a press conference.

""However, apart from the 76 such cases reported over the last two days ... the overall number of new infections remains low,"" Chen said, noting that only four cities and counties reported new cases on Saturday.

To date, the three Taipei markets have reported more than 200 cases. This includes over 100 at Huannan Market, 80-plus cases at the First Fruit &amp; Vegetable Wholesale Market, and around 20 at the Second Fruit &amp; Vegetable Wholesale Market, Chen said.

In addition to closing Huannan Market through July 5, the CECC also sent out over 80,000 text alerts Friday to people whose phone data showed they had recently been in the vicinity of the market, urging them to get tested if they develop any COVID-19 symptoms, Chen said.

A further round of testing on workers and contractors at the three markets will begin on July 8, he added.

Meanwhile, regarding a cluster of 15 Delta variant cases in Pingtung County, Chen said the local government screened over 12,000 people at community testing stations in the past five days, all of which came back negative.

While public screening in the area will continue through July 11, ""at this point we can pretty much say that the community is safe,"" Chen said.

Of the 80 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday, 76 were domestically transmitted. Taipei reported 48 cases, followed by New Taipei with 24, Taoyuan with three and Hsinchu City with one.

Fifty-five of the domestic cases had a known source of infection, while the other 21 are under investigation, the CECC said.

Meanwhile, the four imported cases all involved Taiwan nationals, who recently returned to the country from the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan and Cambodia.

The 10 deaths reported Saturday were five men and five women, in their 50s to their 90s, who died between June 26 and July 2, according to the CECC.

To date, Taiwan has confirmed 14,991 cases of COVID-19, of which more than 13,500 are domestic infections recorded since May 15, when the country first reported over 100 new cases in a single day.

The number of deaths from COVID-19 has risen to 686, including 674 since May 15, CECC data showed.

I come from immigrants, and can bounce between the United States and my home country whenever I please. In my other country, residents have been offered a sinovac series.

Is that a safer outcome than not being vaccinated, and thus by policy having to take my temperature and spo2 everyday, and take two covid PCR tests per week?

The vaccine has and will very strongly reduce the chances of hospitalization (which is exactly what they were designed to do - the reduction in infection rate was a bonus). Keep in mind that there has NEVER been a vaccine that prevents infection 100% of the time (mumps has like an 80 something % effectiveness rate iirc).

Furthermore, you are fixated only on the risk to yourself in a bubble. The primary trouble with covid is not an individual catching covid, but rather a community catching it. Covid is highly infective, with a high rate of hospitalization. Sure, most people won't die from it (IF they get medical attention), but those that get hospitalized take up hospital space and use medical supplies. If covid ransacks its way through a community (assuming no masking/distancing), it will very easily overwhelm any hosptials within that community. This was shown in early modeling from the ""flatten the curve"" graph. Even with masking and distancing, some states hit 90+% ICU capacity statewide at their worst. The vaccine acts as a permanent solution (as opposed to the temporary solution of masking/distancing) because it removes that hospitalization risk.

&gt;Should fully vaccinated people be concerned about the Delta variant in their own country or destination country?

&gt;Delta is the most transmissible of the variants detected so far, being twice as contagious as the original virus. Cases and hospitalizations from it are increasing in many countries around the world and it is becoming the dominant variant in a number of them.

&gt;The good news is that most of the vaccines that we’re using in the world today seem to be effective at preventing severe disease from Delta and the other variants currently in circulation.

&gt;But while vaccinated people are less likely to be hospitalized because of the disease, this doesn’t mean they should drop their guard: they can still get ill from the virus and can still spread it to others. That’s why it’s important for everyone to follow our #SummerSense tips.

Neither group (CDC or WHO) is high in credibility to me tbh. Probably the reality is that if you can get sick after vaccination, you can spread the virus, but I agree it’s not the major driver of infection.  I would love to see a definitive study and someone must have done one.

&gt;  
&gt;*Sanquin Research reports that the percentage of donors with antibodies to the coronavirus has increased to 77%. Vaccination is the major driver behind this increase.*  
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;The vaccination strategy is clearly reflected in the breakdown by age. Among donors between 41 and 50 years of age, 80% already have antibodies. Among donors between 31 and 40 years of age, this is 50%. We soon expect to see an increase in the group of 20-somethings with antibodies.  
&gt;  
&gt;The graphs show a strong increase for each of the age groups from the moment they could be vaccinated. Sanquin uses a test to distinguish different corona antibodies, to determine whether someone has developed antibodies through vaccination or infection.  
&gt;  
&gt;[\[GRAPH\]](https://www.sanquin.nl/binaries/content/gallery/sanquinnl/artikelen/2021/sanquin_donorbalkjes_vaccinatie_of_infectie_week25.png)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Vaccination remains important**  
&gt;  
&gt;With new variants of the virus in circulation, it is not entirely clear what percentage of people with antibodies is needed to suppress the circulation of the virus. In addition, the distribution of those vaccinations is important. An average high vaccination rate does not yet mean that in communities and places with lower vaccination rates, protection against the virus is adequate. It remains therefore of great importance to get vaccinated!  
&gt;  
&gt;**Sanquin Finger on the Wrist Study**  
&gt;  
&gt;Every week, Sanquin's Finger on the Wrist (VAP) study examines a sample of about 2,000 blood donors for corona antibodies, in collaboration with RIVM. Measuring antibodies in donors provides insight into the spread of COVID-19 and the extent of vaccination in the Netherlands. Sanquin is doing this at the request of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport.

CFR is lower, but that isn't the same as a broken link.  If old people have 90% uptake then CFR could be low enough to let all the young catch it - this could be why the UK is at 0.3% CFR but the US is still at 1-2% (more test avoidance in the US should also contribute).  But it's unclear why you would do this rather than waiting two weeks to give younger people their first dose.

The vaccine has only been approved for children above 12. Vaccination campaign for healthy children started this week. Previously children with health problems/who lived with vulnerable people were already invited/vaccinated. As of today the oldest of these healthy children (born in 2004) became eligible. The coming days the remaining ages will become eligible. 16 and 17 year olds make their own decisions. 12 to 15 year olds decide together with their parents/guardian but ultimately it is the child's choice even if they disagree. For this survey parents of children in the specified age groups were asked if they would let their children get vaccinated.

Here is a translation of the article:

&gt;**Vaccination readiness was low in the Netherlands, but that turned around. How could that be?**  
&gt;  
&gt;*Initially, things didn't look good for the Dutch vaccination campaign. Vaccination got off to a slow start early this year and the average Dutch person wasn't exactly eager to pick up that shot. In the autumn of 2020, just over half of the population wanted to be vaccinated. The rest had doubts or were certain that they did not.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***A remarkable change in trend***  
&gt;  
&gt;In the meantime, the mood has reversed and the Netherlands is in the European lead group with a vaccination readiness of 94 percent, according to the RIVM behavioral survey published Friday. Among the elderly, almost no refusers can be found, but also 90 percent of young people aged 16 to 24 say they will be vaccinated or have already been vaccinated.  
&gt;  
&gt;In practice, however, the act is not always followed by the word. In every age category, the percentage that has been (fully) vaccinated lags slightly behind the survey figures. But what is not, can still come, says a spokesperson for the RIVM. ""In most groups, vaccination is still going on.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The change in trend, which must have occurred early this year, is remarkable. People have gradually gained confidence in it during the campaign, explains Marijn de Bruin of the behavioral unit of the RIVM. His team's research shows that the Dutch had three main arguments for taking the vaccine: it was good for their health, they protected others with it and it offered a way out of the crisis. De Bruin: ""In the past few months the vaccines have proven themselves. The hospitalization rate dropped, as did the number of infections, and we started easing up again.""  
&gt;  
&gt;[\[GRAPH\]](https://images0.persgroep.net/rcs/GQgEOYvaVVmY4sTqkcE5-m7jQtA/diocontent/204662266/_fitwidth/1240?appId=93a17a8fd81db0de025c8abd1cca1279&amp;quality=0.9)  
&gt;  
&gt;***Doubters postponed the decision until the vaccination moment***  
&gt;  
&gt;Doubts, on the other hand, were fueled by the possible side effects and harmful effects in the longer term. ""But everyone saw that things were going well,"" says De Bruin. ""People in the area who were vaccinated hardly suffered from anything."" And to the extent that there were side effects, the government was transparent about them, he says.  
&gt;  
&gt;That strengthened confidence in the approach. That had dropped from an impressive 75 percent during the first wave to 34 percent in early May - people were tired of the measures and annoyed by the messy and sometimes unclear approach to the crisis. But now 49 percent are confident again. ""A substantial break in the trend.""Although some needed some time to do so. The researchers saw that many doubters postponed their decision until it was their turn. ""At that point, they looked for information about the state of affairs. And then they decided to go for it after all.  
&gt;  
&gt;***A run on Janssen after all, against the advice of the Health Council***  
&gt;  
&gt;Last week there was a run on the Janssen vaccine after outgoing minister Hugo de Jonge made the remainder of the stock available to everyone. The GGD's were called by young people who saw this as an opportunity to go on vacation or to visit a festival. This seems to indicate a very pragmatic mind - the Health Council had advised against giving this vaccine to young people a month earlier for safety reasons - but De Bruin sees it more broadly. ""Our surveys showed that many young people had wanted to be vaccinated earlier than according to the schedule. Often for the same reasons as the older ones. This option offered an additional way out of the crisis.""  
&gt;  
&gt;***Adolescent doubts due to long-term effect***  
&gt;  
&gt;For the first time, 12- to 18-year-olds were also questioned about their vaccination readiness. It's not their turn yet, but the cabinet decided this week on the advice of the Health Council to offer them a vaccine as well. 72 percent will (probably) get vaccinated, 8 percent are still unsure. Among 16- and 17-year-olds, the willingness is greater than in the 12 to 15-year-old category: 79 to 68 percent. Their reasons for taking the vaccine are similar to those of adults. Teenagers are hesitant mainly because of fear of unknown long-term effects.

As vaccines were shared based on population size. Vaccination readiness in the UK for example is also very high and has an even bigger population. A bigger population and country also gives you more sites and manpower to vaccinate and organise the vaccination program, so that shouldn't be a problem either.

So I think it indeed purely boils down to vaccine hesitancy in the population. Hopefully most of the elderly and vulnerable will be vaccinated, because new waves will come for sure and you don't want hospitals to fill up again and lots of people dying when the wave eventually comes back.

60 - 70% actually sounds quite decent. You can get a pretty high level of protection with that and should make handling new waves much easier.

I don’t think so.  The vaccine works by producing the entire protein spike.  It’s like putting up a wanted sign for Bears.  Now the Bears breed and create new Bears but the new Bears are still Bears and they’re easily identifiable as Bears.  The vaccine works the same way.  The entire protein spike was used to put up the wanted poster.  That means that any virus with a covid protein spike is easily identifiable as covid by the immune system and the body attacks it. It will work on all variants until the virus mutates beyond being human infectious covid and at that point it won’t be a problem to humans as the spike can’t latch onto human cells.

See let’s look at giraffes as an example.
Long ago giraffes may have had much shorter necks. They may not have been able to access as much food because they couldn’t reach high into the tree tops. But along came a few offspring that were born with slightly longer necks. They had an easier time getting to the food source and so they were able to produce more babies because more food = more reproductive activity.
Over time, the number of giraffe families that had longer necks reproduced faster than giraffe families with shorter necks, and in time those long necked families were more efficient at gathering food for themselves. In time, the shorter necked giraffes could not keep up with reproduction and were out-bred.

The lack of a food source acted as a selective constraint to guide the evolutionary path for the giraffe.

Similarly, with a virus, instead of food to reproduce, they need a host.
If many of their potential hosts are vaccinated, then many viruses might not be able to use them. However, some of their offspring may have mutations that allow them to still infect vaccinated hosts.

In time, those mutated viruses will get access to those hosts and be able to reproduce, causing the species as a whole to adapt that mutation that allows them to infect vaccinated hosts.

This is the same sort of process that allows bacteria to develop anti-biotic resistant properties. This is why it’s encouraged to only use antibiotics as needed, and when you do use them, use them all to ensure no trace of the bacteria is left alive so that they don’t go on to spread their acquired antibiotic resistance.",,,1625329772,,{},h3xmihy,False,t3_ocwhp4,False,True,t1_h3xlbm5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ocwhp4/unvaccinated_people_are_variant_factories/h3xmihy/,1625563103,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

This would be compounded in humans as we would react stronger to a deadlier variant (lockdowns, social distancing, etc). Again, there’s no goal here, a deadlier variant could arise and wipe a lot of people out, but that doesn’t make a successful virus.

[],,FightingDad,,,[],,,,text,t2_b5dmznhw,False,False,[],"I’m glad this is here because I didn’t want to post and I can’t. So here is the thing, before the pandemic I had asthma an issue I had struggled with all my life, and more I constantly got sick starting usually with colds then respiratory infections, walking neumonía, chronic sinus infections, all of this before ultimately getting better and slowly starting the same cycle all over again from year to year with varying degrees of severity fluctuating throughout my life. After 2020 specifically January or maybe December year previous I had come back home to Oregon because I was chronically ill and unable to eat food. I had gone from 220lb to just 147 in two months. That issue is still on going, I only mention it to make known that I had previously been in a failed physical state as well prior to the outbreak. When the outbreak occurred it did so in Hillsboro Oregon the city we lived in at the time and we had already been sick all of us with respiratory issues. Something we’re all well familiar with and more and equipped to deal with it since it runs in the family. It passed like nothing for my family but I as per usual began my long cycle starting with the initial cold step; however, when it came to the respiratory infection step everything changed. In the past my mucus at this point would be thick heavy and brown and it would make it extremely difficult and painful for me to remove it by force namely deliberately coughing it all up over and over again until all of it for that day was gone and then sleep, rinse, repeat until fully recovered people I am poor as SHIT! When it’s your whole Life! You find a way. Anyways, I got to that step but this time my mucus had changed. It was now white like histamine, light, stringy and sticky. This made it near impossible to cough out. The only reason my method had worked in the past was because it was near solid when brown and I could use the muscles around my lungs to forcefully eject the solid mass once it had built to a certain level. Now as right now, it just stays as a light presence in my lungs, but at that time I tried wildly to eject it to the point that I may have either dislocated my collar bone documented as having been dislocated as a child or my shoulder I don’t know for sure, I tried and failed but it’s ok. I was for reasons I won’t get into examined against my will at a hospital some time after these events and they cleared me as never having had the corona virus, subsequently released from unmentioned hospital. Since that time my mucus has not gone back to the way it was, and I’ve not gotten any colds, sinus infections none of it. I started gaining my weight back, more my muscle is rebuilding with very little effort and I have not changed my diet. I eat virtually nothing and I mean that. I am daily on a starvation diet. My wife currently is trying to follow me, she is at 114lb, meanwhile eating less than she does I currently am just under 180lb. I ate steak two days ago. I virtually only eat meat these days. 

Here is what I know. Prior to the outbreak I was withering and I had been fighting respiratory issues my whole life despite making more than the usual effort to maintain my health through rigorous diet and exercise which had wained in the last three years leading up due to family, a child, full time work, and marital stress. Currently I am demonstrably better. No changes to my diet since 2019 which consist of regular daily fasting only drinking milk sometimes mixed with peanut butter and a banana once or twice daily, and occasionally red meat and sea life. No changes to my family whom I still continue to struggle with daily weighting heavily on my psyche. I’ve been out of work since 2019 so that has not changed, but things overall in my family and my living situation has improved. Nevertheless the bigger factory being diet has not changed, but my mucus has. I’m writing this while caring for my eight month old son one of two so spare me some consideration here, if you’re still reading lol, in conclusion I got better after the pandemic, and although I was told I had not been infected I believe that I was, and I also believe that I’ve overall as a life form become stronger as a result. I’m changing physically and physiologically for my betterment and that makes me genuinely wonder if vaccinating myself against these possible natural dangers is not the wrong way to go? Are we not looking for that key to open the door to the next phase of biological evolution? Or are we just waiting for Elon and machines to make things easy for us? I’m not sure I want to follow that path. Not anymore. Not since getting sick and better for it.

There is no question you are right that in large part political viewpoints play a massive role in determining whether one is vaccinated or not, which is sad imho.

Across many generations, a virus can evolve in a way that mimics rationality, because viruses that keep their hosts alive tend to do a lot better overall.

&gt; But in Los Angeles County, a sudden rise in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations has put a damper on the holiday spirit.

&gt; L.A. County public health officials are breaking with many other health departments, asking even inoculated residents to modify their behavior amid a concerning uptick in coronavirus transmission and the circulation of the highly contagious Delta variant.

&gt; In recommending that all residents wear masks in public indoor spaces — regardless of whether they’ve been vaccinated for COVID-19 — the nation’s most-populous county is an outlier. Neither state nor federal health officials have taken that step.

&gt; Officials attribute the increase of cases and hospitalizations in L.A. County to the Delta variant spreading among the region’s unvaccinated population. About 51% of L.A. County residents are fully vaccinated, well behind most counties in the San Francisco Bay Area. There are some 4 million in L.A. County who have not had a single dose, including 1.3 million who are not yet eligible.

&gt; Two warning signs emerged in the past few days, showing how dramatically fortunes can change: Coronavirus cases in L.A. County have more than doubled in the last week, and hospitalizations are up by 30% — trends that are significantly worse than those observed nationally.

&gt; The increase is particularly notable among L.A. County’s Black residents, who are vaccinated at lower rates than other racial and ethnic groups. COVID-19 hospitalizations among Black residents rose by 11% between mid-May and mid-June.",,,1625337214,,{},h3y0uvl,True,t3_od3imm,False,False,t3_od3imm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/od3imm/as_others_chill_la_county_sounds_alarms_over/h3y0uvl/,1625570593,44,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

Sigisoara is a lovely semi preserved medieval city if you have time to drive over there.

Btw, driving in the mountains with crazy people passing on blind curves is going to probably stress you a bit.  Bran castle is pretty neat to see and have photos from, but there are bunch of other castles around there too.

If you get to Bucharest for any time please consider eating a meal or two at Zexe.  It’s amazing food and prices and it features foods typical of the nobility a couple centuries ago.

I find weird cool buildings to admire while walking around, but it’s kind of hard to say “check this out,” because it’s not cohesive?  I just walked along a portion Dacia blvd today that had *some* interesting architecture for example, but I don’t know if you would want to wander along for that.  Old town is cool, but if you do want to see something different then I can try to refine my walk around the ‘hood list.  :)  feel free to message.

Science says the risk is very low, but not that it is zero.  Humans have to choose what level of risk is worthwhile.

Speaking at the daily Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) press briefing, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said the recent outbreak continues to ease, but the new cases confirmed at the wholesale market in Wanhua District needed to be closely monitored.

Taipei reported earlier Friday that 41 vendors in the market tested positive for COVID-19, none of which were included in Friday's tallies.

The cases were discovered as all vendors at the site were being tested for COVID-19 after the nearby First Fruit &amp; Vegetable Wholesale Market reported a cluster infection in late June.

The PCR screening program was to test around 2,800 individuals at Huannan Market and another 8,400 people at the First and Second Fruit &amp; Vegetable Wholesale Markets from July 1 to 3.
It was not known how many people at the Huannan Market had been tested to get the 41 positive results.

More cases could be discovered as testing continues, but for now operations at Huannan Market will be suspended until July 5 so that it can be fully disinfected, Chen said.

Using the government's contact tracing app, text messages are also being sent to anyone who has visited the market over the past few days to urge them to get tested for COVID-19, Chen said.

According to the CECC, it expects to have all of the contacts of infected vendors identified and quarantined by Saturday, while a special command center has been set up at Huannan Market to monitor the situation there.

Friday's new cases brought the total in the country to 14,911, of which around 13,500 are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded more than 100 COVID-19 cases in a single day.

The 15 deaths reported were eight men and seven women, in their 40s to 80s, who passed away between June 3 and June 30, the CECC said.
To date, 676 people in Taiwan have died of COVID-19, including 664 since May 15.

Of the 57 new domestic cases reported Thursday, 29 were in Taipei and 15 in New Taipei.

Hsinchu County reported four cases, with three each in Taoyuan and Keelung. Taichung reported two cases and Hsinchu City one, CECC data showed.

No new case was reported for a cluster in Pingtung County caused by the Delta variant.

Among the 57 cases, six had unclear links to other cases, 23 are being investigated and 28 had a known source of infection, the CECC said.

The one imported case, meanwhile, was a Taiwanese national in her 50s, who entered Taiwan on June 28 from Hungary, the CECC said.

“There’s sort of isolated parts of the country where you’re seeing infection levels rise. The rest of the country looks very good,” Gottlieb said. “I think what you’re seeing is a decoupling between places with high vaccination rates and places with low vaccination rates. You’re also, quite frankly, seeing a decoupling between cases and the extreme death and disease that this virus was causing.”

In nations with high vaccination rates but also rising cases due to the delta variant, such as the U.K. and Israel, “hospitalizations and deaths aren’t increasing” in the manner they had earlier in the global health crisis, Gottlieb said.

“For a while, we thought that was just the lagging effect where you don’t see hospitalizations pick up until three, four weeks after you see cases start to rise, same with deaths,” said Gottlieb, who led the FDA from 2017 to 2019 in the Trump administration.

No.

Breakthrough infection is rare, but it does happen.

Infection requires exposure to someone who has it.  (Since the whole fomites thing has been refuted.)

Because breakthrough infection is rare, you are statistically less likely to be *exposed* to COVID-19 if you are in a group of fully vaccinated people, because there’s less of a chance for each person in the group to be carrying it.

If you are in a group with unvaccinated people, you are at a higher risk of being *exposed* because the unvaccinated person is statistically more likely to have it.

So… you are partially right that it’s safer to be around other vaccinated people.  But you’re wrong saying that only unvaccinated people can infect vaccinated people.

Basically every vaccinated person who gets exposed to SARS-CoV-2 virus “rolls the dice” of will they be a breakthrough infection.

By not getting *exposed*, then you don’t have to roll the dice.

Or another way of looking at it, it takes two rolls to get infected.

- Roll the dice on whether or not someone around you exposed you to the virus.

- Roll the dice on whether this exposure will give you a breakthrough infection

If you’re in a highly vaccinated community, the first dice roll is going to fall into your favor at a much, much higher frequency.  It becomes rare to even be *exposed* to the virus.

If you’re around a lot of unvaccinated people often, you have a much higher chance of failing that first dice roll, exposing you to the second dice roll.

The more often you have to make that second roll, the more at risk you are for becoming a breakthrough case… but, the odds are still generally favorable, at least with this variant.

Vaccination also makes the odds more favorable for subsequent dice rolls that come with being infected: will you spread it to others?  Will you go to the hospital?  Will you go to the ICU?  Will you have a negative outcome of morbidity?

Data shows us that vaccination makes all of those dice rolls more favorable odds, too.

But in theory, there’s always going to be unlikely dice rolls.  The best we can do is follow CDC Guidelines to manage your risk as best as you can.

And help encourage people to get vaccinated, which lowers all of our risk.",,,1625324385,,{},h3xc9kl,False,t3_occkh7,False,False,t1_h3x9xb0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/occkh7/st_louis_area_health_officials_urge_all_residents/h3xc9kl/,1625557961,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

For some it only gives partial protection, meaning you can still get sick, just not *as* sick.

The vaccines give your immune system a 'free shot' at learning to fight the virus without actually being infected by the real virus. The end result is that your body keeps experimenting until it finds a working antibody.

The thing is, it's a random process. It always is, no matter what the disease is. The immune system creates millions of potential antibodies to fight the virus, until it finds one that works. Only... this inevitably results in millions of people's immune systems finding slightly different antibodies. In addition, not every person's immune system is equally fast or aggressive in responding to infection. So even though going through the vaccination consistently gives you good protection, the exact outcome will vary, based on luck and the health of your immune system.

For a lot of people, the vaccination results in your body learning to fight the virus so well that it gets killed extremely quickly if you are ever in contact with the virus, meaning you never get sick and are very unlikely to pass it on to anyone (Unless, say, you get it on your hand, and shake hands with someone, and then they touch their eye or mouth or whatever). For some people, the immunity is strong enough that you will never get noticeably sick from the virus, but maybe it can survive in your system for a few hours and even be spread on. For some unlucky people, the 'immunity' just gives enough resistance to prevent a severe case but you can still end up sick for a week or two. Which sucks, but at least you're now just dealing with what feels to you like a mostly harmless flu. For a very few people, mostly those with compromised immune system from preexisting conditions, the vaccine accomplishes nothing or almost nothing.",,,1625328954,,{},h3xkyc4,False,t3_ocwhp4,False,False,t1_h3xbxpt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ocwhp4/unvaccinated_people_are_variant_factories/h3xkyc4/,1625562279,45,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],

Nevada is reporting the highest-in-the nation rate of new Covid-19 cases, just as the gambling mecca of Las Vegas prepares for what could be its biggest weekend since reopening.

The state ranked first in the U.S. with almost 112 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The average daily hospital admissions have jumped 44% from a week earlier to about 55 a day, with a surprising increase in the 30-to-39-year-old cohort.

The bad news comes just as Las Vegas, one of the top tourist destinations in the country, is seeing a rebound in visitors. Some 2.9 million tourists came to the city in May, a nearly 12% increase from the prior month. About 300,000 more are expected to descend on Las Vegas for the Fourth of July holiday weekend, according to the Nevada Department of Transportation.

“There’s a lot of people coming here from all over,” said Michael Gardner, vice dean for clinical affairs for the School of Medicine at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “Some of these visitors will be bringing things.”

Nevada is coping with a convergence of factors. The state has a low vaccination rate with fewer than half of its residents receiving at least one dose. That’s coinciding with a return of Las Vegas’s famous nightlife: casinos and restaurants are packed to the point where it’s difficult to even get a reservation, with many locals also enjoying the fun. Masks are rarely worn.

Resorts World, the latest property to open along the Las Vegas Strip, said it’s “solidly booked” this weekend at average room rates not seen even before the pandemic as visitors flood the city.

About 90% of new patients in the greater Las Vegas area were people who weren’t vaccinated, according to Cassius Lockett, director for disease surveillance and control at the Southern Nevada Health District. The highly contagious delta variant is also becoming more prevalent, now making up almost a quarter of cases from just 2.2% in May.

While previous surges in the state were tied to essential workers and others returning to work, the latest uptick is based on people -- younger ones in particular -- getting out more, Lockett said. Many hotel and restaurant workers have gotten vaccinated.

“It is a function of our economy reopening,” he said. “There are a lot more gatherings. We have prevention fatigue, especially among the younger population. We definitely have a lot of masking fatigue.”",,,1625328409,,{},h3xjwsw,True,t3_od0vrm,False,False,t3_od0vrm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/od0vrm/nevada_leads_nation_in_covid_cases_as_300000/h3xjwsw/,1625561773,42,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

How effective are COVID-19 vaccines against the Delta variant?

By Melissa HealyStaff Writer 
July 2, 2021 8:27 AM PT
Once a distant threat, the Delta variant of the coronavirus first identified in India has reached every corner of the United States — and it promises to live up to its name.

The Greek letter delta is a scientific shorthand for “change.” It’s increasingly clear that the coronavirus strain that bears its name is on track to shift the pandemic’s trajectory.

The Delta variant is estimated to be 60% more transmissible than the next-most infectious strain — the Alpha variant first detected in the United Kingdom. That means it spreads close to twice as readily as the original coronavirus

But vaccines can limit its havoc, and more than 181 million Americans have received at least one dose. How much will this protection help against the Delta variant? We explore.

Will the COVID-19 vaccines protect me from the Delta variant?

Yes, though at a slightly reduced level than against other versions of the coronavirus. And if you got a vaccine that requires two doses — in the U.S., that means the ones made by Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna — you need to have gotten both shots and then waited two weeks to reach full immunity.

A study based on real-world data from the U.K. found that two doses of the Pfizer vaccine were 88% effective at preventing COVID-19 as a result of an infection with the Delta variant. That’s just a notch down from the 95% efficacy it demonstrated in clinical trials against earlier, less transmissible strains.

However, for those who’ve had just a single dose of vaccines made by either Pfizer or AstraZeneca, the effectiveness against the Delta variant was only 33%, the U.K. researchers found. The effectiveness of one dose of those vaccines against earlier strains had been 51%.

These results are backed up by laboratory tests of antibodies produced in response to two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. Those antibodies were able to neutralize the Delta variant, but they did so with a 9.6-fold reduction in efficacy. That’s likely to translate into a very modest reduction in effectiveness, since the vaccine mobilizes an army of “neutralizing” antibodies that is far larger than what is needed to stop or slow replication of the virus in human cells.

But I got the one dose of the Moderna vaccine. Will that protect me?

Moderna said this week that its vaccine — which is very similar to the Pfizer shot — is also highly effective against the Delta variant.

The company tested blood serum from eight fully vaccinated individuals and found a 2.1-fold reduction in the efficiency with which those people would fend off infection with the Delta variant. Again, given the legion of antibodies induced by the vaccine, this reduction should have little to no effect on the vaccine’s protection.

I got the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot. Am I protected against the Delta variant?

The jury is still out on this one.

In early June, researchers tested the serum of people vaccinated with the J&amp;J vaccine against a variety of “variants of concern,” and found its performance suffered very little against the Beta, Gamma and Epsilon variants that were first detected in South Africa, Brazil and California, respectively. But the Delta variant wasn’t included in the tests.

Johnson &amp; Johnson is now reporting that in a lab study, the serum of eight people who got the company’s vaccine mounted a strong immune response to the Delta variant. But they didn’t say just how strong, and the paper presenting those results hasn’t been posted yet.

The J&amp;J vaccine bears a strong resemblance to the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has been widely used in the United Kingdom and was tested against the Delta variant there. In that study, getting both doses was 60% effective at reducing the risk of COVID-19 caused by Delta.

The J&amp;J vaccine will have to be tested against the Delta variant in larger studies to get a clearer picture of the protection it provides. Johnson &amp; Johnson is now testing a two-shot regimen. If this provides strong protection against Delta, then booster shots may be in order.

Should I still be wearing a mask to protect against the Delta variant even if I’m vaccinated?

Research conducted in the U.K. from November 2020 to mid-May 2021 found that even the face coverings and social-distancing strictures in place during most of that period didn’t stop the Delta variant from spreading through what was at that time a lightly vaccinated population. (However, those measures almost certainly helped slow the virus’ spread)

There are other things to consider besides your vaccination status. What’s the vaccination rates of your community? How long has the Delta variant been in your area?

Once Delta has crept in, it won’t take long to see whether it begins to crowd out other variants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps track of where it is. You can also check your state and county health departments’ websites for more detailed information about the variants where you live. If transmission in a place is characterized as “substantial” or “high,” consider wearing a mask even if you’re vaccinated.

Your community’s level of vaccination also matters. In early May, the Delta variant elbowed other circulating variants out of the picture more quickly in counties where less than 29% of the population was fully vaccinated, according to a study. But Delta competed strongly when vaccination levels were higher as well, and a number of U.S. counties are currently showing that even when 40% to 50% of residents are fully vaccinated, the variant will spread briskly.

I already had COVID-19, so I have some natural immunity. Will that help me against the Delta variant?

Sometimes, the Delta variant appears to care that you’ve got natural immunity. But not always.

A study by Columbia University researchers estimated that, based on India’s recent disastrous wave of Delta-fueled infections, natural immunity is protective “approximately half of the time.”

It’s still not known, though, whether it matters which variant infected you before, how long ago you had it, or how robustly your immune system responded to that first infection. Given those uncertainties, if you’re willing to run a 50% chance of catching the Delta variant, there’s one more piece of data to throw into the mix: a study by the U.K.'s Office of National Statistics tracked more than 300,000 Britons who had tested positive for infection with any variant of the virus. It found that, 18 weeks out, almost 14% reported lingering symptoms.

If I come down with COVID-19, how will I know if I’ve got the Delta variant?

If you’ve been infected recently in the U.S., there’s roughly a one-in-four chance it’s Delta. That’s because about 25% of coronavirus samples being genetically sequenced these days turn out to be the Delta variant, according to the CDC.

But as in all things related to COVID-19, this varies widely from state to state and even county to county. From Montana to the Dakotas, and from Utah to Iowa and Missouri, the Delta variant now is thought to be responsible for as many as 57% of new coronavirus cases. In the CDC monitoring region made of California, Nevada and Arizona, it’s making its way up the charts and is now considered responsible for 38% of new cases. Meanwhile, from the mid-Atlantic to New England and in the Pacific Northwest, it’s just getting started.

If you’ve been vaccinated with any of the COVID-19 vaccines and are experiencing symptoms, you should get tested. You are unlikely to get very sick, but hospitalizations of vaccinated people are being sporadically reported across the country",,,1625327829,,{},h3xis7v,False,t3_oczmz1,False,True,t3_oczmz1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oczmz1/how_effective_are_covid19_vaccines_against_the/h3xis7v/,1625561222,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

&gt; It will also be important to understand how long vaccine-based immunity lasts, and whether boosters are necessary over time. For both these reasons, COVID-19 could become like the flu.

&gt; This isn’t as grim as it might sound. Even without herd immunity, the ability to vaccinate vulnerable people seems to be reducing hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19. The disease might not disappear any time soon, but its prominence is likely to wane.

Vaccines will always change selection pressure, but that does not mean we shouldn't continue to update them. The benefits of reducing hospitalization are greater than worrying about selection for an extremely strong variant.

Giving priority to general medical staff (over elderly) was discussed in my country, shot down (and also partly refused by healthy MDs and staff) because it was not seen as using the vaccines where they was most needed.

A successful variant needs to be more contagious, which is biologically unrelated to how deadly it is, so that would lead to a 50/50 chance on whether it gets more or less deadly (or it could stay the same as well). However, there are two social reasons why a deadlier variant is usually less contagious.

First, a deadlier variant is more likely it is to be noticed both by the infected and the people around them, causing the infected to be more isolated when they are contagious. Second, if a variant is too deadly, then people will alter their actions to have more government action, social distancing, and isolation. Imagine if a variant became 90% deadly how people would react compared to now.

Unfortunately, both of these factors are mitigated in the specific case of COVID. For the first factor, COVID is often contagious before symptoms appear, so that decouples the deadliness from how noticeable it is when you are in the contagious phase.

Of the mutations found in the patient, both the UK and South African variants were noted to be present at one point or another throughout the length of the woman's infection.

Additionally, the fact that the disease stays present within the body of immunosuppressed patients for longer periods of time compared to healthier individuals could mean that HIV patients could be an incessant source of transmission and mutations of the coronavirus - almost like a factory of variants.""

As in ""why is that a manipulation""? I'll assumethat's what you meant. It would be a manipulation because we don't know that the unvaccinated are ""variant factories"" any more than unvaccinated people are variant factories. And it's a manipulation because to believe it we have to pretend that the vaccinated aren't carrying and spreading covid. 

I'm going to quote the first few lines of the CNN article. Note that the articleignores that vaccinated people can still get covid and are indeed getting covid: 

&gt;Unvaccinated people do more than merely risk their own health. They're also a risk to everyone if they become infected with coronavirus, infectious disease specialists say.

&gt;That's because the only source of new coronavirus variants is the body of an infected person.

&gt;""Unvaccinated people are potential variant factories,"" Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told CNN Friday.

&gt;""The more unvaccinated people there are, the more opportunities for the virus to multiply,"" Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said.

They are ignoring that vaccinated people still get covid and that since symptoms are milder for them, they are carrying it under the radar unless someone in a cluster gets tested. 

Now, are unvaccinated people creating *more* opportunities for mutations than the vaccinated? It's possible.

&gt; It told the vivid story of what health care workers in the Ozarks are facing as hospital beds are filling again, this time with cases from the delta variant. The numbers are skyrocketing in Branson and rural areas, and the vaccination rate is so low it’s made national news.

&gt; So Kaitlyn McConnell wrote about the email and posted it on the health system’s Facebook page Wednesday night.

&gt; “A patient we had yesterday is tragically not with us today,” her post read. “... A COVID-19 nurse manager shared with me a very impactful story from a patient in his 40s in the COVID unit who passed last night. We had him for a week and, unfortunately, he continued to deteriorate to the point requiring intubation.

&gt; “Prior to intubating, he became very tearful. He told the nurses he didn’t think he needed to get vaccinated and now wishes he had, and he was so sorry.”

&gt; “This is one person, but it is the example of the worst case scenario of this pandemic,” McConnell said Friday morning. “Hearing about not just statistics, but this very real person really resonated with me. The sentiment was he wished he had made a different choice.”

&gt; Sometimes the transparency and communication from medical and hospital officials can include straight, blunt talk to clear up widely spread misinformation that has kept people from getting vaccinated. Because, as McConnell put it: “We’re seeing people dying.”

&gt; On Thursday, hours after McConnell posted about the man dying from COVID-19, CoxHealth CEO Steve Edwards took to Twitter. He tweeted that a recent 32% positive rate of symptomatic tests was “very concerning” and that four children, one as young as “a few weeks old,” had been hospitalized with the virus.

&gt; “If you are making wildly disparaging comments about the vaccine, and have no public health expertise, you may be responsible for someone’s death,” he tweeted. “Shut up.”",,,1625340393,,{},h3y6xu2,True,t3_od4l5a,False,True,t3_od4l5a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/od4l5a/missouri_patient_in_his_40s_so_sorry_he_didnt_get/h3y6xu2/,1625573917,31,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

July 3, 2021
Updated 2:26 p.m. ET
On a recent Sunday night at Le Bilboquet, a see-and-be-seen restaurant in the Hamptons, well-heeled diners nibbled on $475 tins of Osetra caviar. A handsome man showed off his gold Audemars Piguet watch to his sparkly female companion. A party of 10 in polo shirts and striped rompers danced to a tropical house remix of Tina Turner’s “What’s Love Got to Do With It.”

They were all unmasked, while the waiters, bartenders and other servers kept their mouths and noses covered.

A similar scene unfolded at the Gucci store in East Hampton, where shoppers removed their masks upon reading the door sign stating that vaccinated customers could enter without face coverings. Inside, they were attended to by store clerks in blue-and-white surgical masks, per company policy.

In the weeks since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised its mask guidelines to allow fully vaccinated people to take their masks off in most indoor settings, a stark divide has emerged, particularly in wealthier enclaves where services are at a premium.

Those who are still wearing masks tend to be members of the service class — store clerks, waiters, janitors, manicurists, security guards, receptionists, hair stylists and drivers — while those without face coverings are often the well-to-do customers being wined and dined.

Employers are hesitant to discuss their mask policies, but there are sensible reasons for requiring staffers to keep their masks on.

Just under 50 percent of people in the United States are fully vaccinated. And coronavirus variants, some of which are highly infectious and may be more resistant to vaccines, are on the rise, said Dr. Lisa Maragakis, an epidemiologist and associate professor at Johns Hopkins University.

Food servers, retail clerks, grocery cashiers and other public-facing workers interact all day with customers, which can put their health (and the health of their customers) at risk. This creates not only potential liability issues for employers, but also could hamstring a business at a time of worker shortages.

Even at establishments that give vaccinated employees the choice to take their masks off, many are keeping them on. “Who knows who has had their shot and who hasn’t,” said Michelle Booker, a store clerk from the Bronx who works at a Verizon store in Midtown Manhattan. She was wearing her mask on a recent Tuesday, although the company permits vaccinated employees to go without masks. “I don’t believe half of the people who come in,” she said. “I’m still terrified.”

And from a public relations standpoint, seeing employees with masks sends a message about how management regards the health of its customers and staff. “Their workers are serious professionals who take safety seriously,” said Erin Vearncombe, a professor at the University of Toronto who studies the sociology of dress codes.

The resulting class divide may not always be intentional, but it still can be jarring to see how masks have emerged as another symbol of inequality from the pandemic.

At an Apple store in Midtown on a recent Friday, mask-free customers could be seen buying $1,500 iPhones from masked salespeople who may not make that much in a week. At a nearby Sweetgreen, food workers in black masks and matching aprons, and who were mostly people of color, prepared $14 berry and burrata salads for a largely white clientele.

“It sends a message — one that’s been internalized on both sides — that the body of the mask wearer is ‘riskier’ than the body of the consumer,” Dr. Vearncombe said. “It shows that certain groups have, and even deserve, more civil liberties than others.”

Some workers argue that the mask double standard — one rule for customers; another for staff — is not just discriminatory, but defies logic.

“Customers have to be vaccinated to go maskless, but we can’t ask for proof,” said Jose de la Rosa, 26, who works behind the counter at the Juice Generation store in Times Square. “And we have workers who are fully vaccinated, can prove it and still have to wear them. It’s odd.”

As more Americans get vaccinated, some establishments have adopted a single policy for both staff and customers, allowing anyone who has been fully vaccinated to ditch the mask.

A diverse array of stores — including Louis Vuitton, Verizon, Dior, Target and Home Depot — have this policy at all their stores in the United States. Starbucks recently announced that vaccinated workers would be able to remove their masks starting July 5.

But for now, a mask divide remains at many places. On a recent afternoon in Hudson Yards, Mark Pasektsky, 49, a public relations strategist, was shopping for shirts at the Theory store. The clerks that were helping him wore masks. He did not.

“It’s weird, right?” he said. “On one level, you can’t completely blame employers. How do you comfortably institute a policy that protects everyone? You can’t answer it because there is no answer. But the psychology behind the other approach is very curious. Why are they making employees wear masks while the customers do not? Everyone is just confused.”",,,1625340364,,{},h3y6vvr,False,t3_od3fff,False,False,t1_h3y0p75,/r/Coronavirus/comments/od3fff/are_masks_a_new_signifier_of_social_class/h3y6vvr/,1625573886,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

This topic is currently being argued about regarding the delta and delta plus variant of the virus for which this thread is named.

Importantly mutation is random.

You could also site viruses that can move back and forth between multiple species of hosts as altering existing strains for the worse.  The number of dice rolled there becomes more complex and the attributes shuffled and multiplied with such transfers.

Again what you have is a trend (a reasonably solid one) and not a guarantee.

Any virus in a host will tend to try to adapt to spread (create copies/offspring).  Yes it is most efficient to follow the trend you are speaking of.  However the route to get there can be littered with many dead hosts.

In regards to the conversion to something akin to the common cold:

This kind of biological drift takes time scales larger than most will be prepared to wait.   The outcome you are laying out is a probable end game - but may require decades of random biological changes and environmental / host pressures.
