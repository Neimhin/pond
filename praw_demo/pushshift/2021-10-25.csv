Translation: with the exception of people like me, the vast majority of Americans are already well protected against severe illness and do not need booster shots.

&gt; ‚ÄúThese are not evidence-based recommendations,‚Äù said Dr. Sarah S. Long

Long, allegedly age 76, apparently wants to wait for a lot more people to die (but not the elderly, of course) before making the obvious recommendations.

&gt; ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that we have evidence that everybody in those groups needs a booster today,‚Äù said Dr. Matthew Daley

Daley apparently feels that because we don't have evidence that everyone needs a booster in those groups, then no one in those groups needs them. An interesting position, given that there are undoubtedly some 65-year olds who don't need a boost, and yet they seem to have little reservation about that decision. Susprisingly, Daley appears to be under 65, but perhaps has some other justification such as immunocompromise, or else just will get the vaccine regardless of official guidelines.

&gt; ‚ÄúThe door just got bigger and bigger and bigger, it got wider and wider with each step,‚Äù Dr. Offit added. ‚ÄúThe companies got what they wanted, the administration got what they wanted.‚Äù

Offit, age ~69, is apparently horrified at the idea that an administration decided to plan for the potential of needing boosters and then that there was sufficient evidence to justify that.

&gt; ‚ÄúThe problem that troubled me is that we don‚Äôt know if boosters are necessary,‚Äù said Dr. Cody Meissner

Wow Meissner, allegedly age 77, sounds the same as everyone else when it comes to under-65s.

&gt; Dr. Perlman said he was opposed to boosters for younger people at first, but voted in favor for other reasons.

Perlman, allegedly age 73, maybe realized that they had children or something who they would want protected.",,,,1635205083,{},hi1syu2,False,t3_qfmg36,False,False,t3_qfmg36,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qfmg36/are_vaccine_boosters_widely_needed_some_federal/hi1syu2/,1635362494.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm talking about good people that are adversely impacted by zero tolerance mandates.  So when CA questions why their zero tolerance mandate didn't work.. I'm happy for those people.  Maybe something will change along the way and a good middle ground will be found.

Vaccination here in the US is very much a political thing.  The reporting of science and common sense has gone right out the window.  It's sad as hell we are in this spot and the zero tolerance is causing no middle ground.  Little things like exceptions for natural immunity has all but disappeared in the US.  It's not because science tells us this, otherwise, the rest of the world would be doing it as well, it's straight up political motivation.  That guy sitting next to your booth in the restaurant from the EU.. He showed the EU Covid passport at the door to get in.  Natural immunity gets his stamped pass.  

Medical exemptions have also just disappeared recently.  You have someone dealing with cancer and can't get vaccinated, they are still terminated, zero tolerance.  Allergic? Sorry, your are gone.  Hell even if you took your time to get the vaccine, got covid and then got the antibody treatment, so now you can't get vaccinated for 120 days.. nope you're fired.  Pregnant mothers who are the most cautious group in society overall.. here is the official CDC stance that came out just mere weeks ago that says it's safe.  That gives you 6 hours to hear about the study, and get your shots before all these vaccine mandates go into effect.  You weren't paying attention, well that's on you, terminated.  Hopefully the company wasn't completely heartless and might offer you something.  

Religious exemptions are just in another ballgame, one that's so inflated because we made it no option but to try and use this.  That in itself it ridiculous.

- Antibodies are the yard dogs who keep the bad guys from getting into your house.  Like real dogs, they don‚Äôt live nearly long enough.  If there aren‚Äôt enough dogs then the bad guys can get in.

- B cells know when someone has broken in and they know how to get more dogs, but doing this takes time (days) and sometimes the dogs get overrun.

- T cells are BIG terminator dogs.

Due to increasing vaccines and small trial numbers we don't have great real world data on how effective boosters are. (Yes there is data, but it just isn't close to the same amount as there was with the original trials)

What we do have are blood tests and lab results done on different people who have undergone mixing and matching along with efficacy rates within their trial subsets (which are a LOT smaller than the first trials).

We can see that mixing and matching produces a higher antibody response - which isn't everything when it comes to vaccines.

Long story short - data is suggesting a mix and match approach is best. How much better still remains to be seen.

To answer your question - I don't think we will see that it is much more effective. Realistically the J&amp;J vaccine vs the mRNA vaccines didn't have as great a difference to the average person as the news outlets would lead you to believe - all vaccines kept people out of hospitals at a great rate and kept symptoms more manageable.

I am personally ""boosting"" with J&amp;J because I am a part of the trial and want them to have results they can opine on. If I were not a part of the J&amp;J trial I would likely take an mRNA booster.

*Currently, about 1,000 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported after vaccination against COVID-19 with one of the mRNA vaccines, Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna.*

*Millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been given, and there have only been 1,000 cases of heart inflammation. Doing the math, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that for every million doses given, there have been 67 cases of heart inflammation in boys 12 to 17 (nine in girls of that age group), 56 in those aged 18 to 24 (six in girls), and 20 in males 25 to 29 (three in girls). That means the risk is quite low.*

I was surprised to see only a relatively small difference between schools with 'masks required' and schools with 'partial mask rules'. 

It will be interesting to see what happens with this graph in the future,  the graph at the moment isn't the full story because the pandemic isn't over. I suspect the schools with strict mask rules will eventually have higher rates of infection than schools without masks because slowing the spread will lead to lower levels of natural immunity. There surely comes a point where all masks do is needlessly prolong the pandemic, because we're pretty much all going to get Covid eventually no matter what we do. Additionally, masks reduce transmission of other seasonal illnesses which may seem like a good thing but at a population level makes us more vulnerable as our resistance to them wanes over time, so that has to be taken into account too.

A review of the literature (e.g., [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/search?q=myocarditis&amp;restrict_sr=on), or searching medrxiv) is quite sparse, but the scientific consensus is that it is significantly more frequent in moderna than in pfizer, which is all the evidence we really need to tie it to dose size.  We also know that smaller doses are highly effective in younger people: the measurable immune response is higher at the dosages we are using, and for instance the 10 mcg dose pfizer is trialing in 5-11 provides a similar measurable response as the 30 does in 12-30.  And there's a lot less data for moderna than pfizer, but part of this is that we aren't giving moderna to anyone under 18 yet. The research is generally consistent in that most or all of the myo/pericarditis is after the second dose, it's all in men/boys, and all in under-30s.  But it's incredibly hard to measure across the board because it is so rare - far rarer than COVID death in all but the youngest age groups, and we know how hard that is to measure.

Even numbers for pfizer vary significantly.  [Here](https://www.fda.gov/media/153086/download) and [here](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2110737) in Israel data they are quite large: as high as 1/10,000. [Here's](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2784800) a study at the other end of the spectrum, which shows an entirely inconsistent 1/150,000 combined rate for both vaccines.  These are easily reconciled, maybe, if you separate mild myocarditis (which probably isn't even a concern) from severe. 

[Here's](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2781601) an n=22 military study that doesn't separate by age, but shows 3/4 of the events were with a moderna second dose; they decline to say what percentage of the military was given pfizer versus moderna though.  It seems to be commonly accepted (multiple governments have stated it, and they do have the data to know) that moderna has more myocarditis than pfizer, but nowhere that I can find actually has this raw data.

[Here's](https://www.aappublications.org/news/2021/06/10/covid-vaccine-myocarditis-rates-061021) a fairly old news article claiming around 250 total myocarditis hospitalizations from vaccination in the US, including 3 ""still in intensive care"".  This puts things in perspective compared to the scope of the pandemic, but in the medium term when we worry about the possibility of regular boosters to this age group it's not sustainable.  As of today I don't think there's a single worldwide confirmed death from myocarditis (I've never seen any confirmed deaths from mRNA vaccines at all, but again it's very hard to confirm such things).

It is a trend with COVID vaccines in general: the side effects are vastly higher than any other vaccine we use.  We are starting to take them for granted, and that's simply unnecessary.  Aside from the smallpox vaccine that was a one-generation endeavor of extinction, no commonly used vaccine has ever had significant side effects. And again the answer is almost certainly smaller doses.  Yet we aren't running trials on those.",,,,1635232164,{},hi355hu,False,t3_qfhbdo,False,True,t1_hi327k8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qfhbdo/moderna_says_its_covid_vaccine_has_strong_results/hi355hu/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,0d55d6ac63e85457b61d59bca1da2f6ed0dd8b0c,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1635232178.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

 As for natural immunity, certain EU countries accept EU green passes for those with natural immunity for up to 6 months, after which you need a vaccine. And since US has no national vaccine passport to track vaccination status or previous infections, cause of the leadership on the right, there is no way to track natural immunity; the honor system does not work cause plenty of Americans have chosen to lie time and time again.

Islam and Judaism forbids the consumption of shellfish.  While the mainline leaders of both religions say vaccinations are okay many of the more conservative members of both faiths don't do vaccinations (including but not limited to COVID).

I've known personally at least one Hindu who doesn't take certain medicines because they contain ingredients from cattle.  Not sure that applies here to the COVID vaccine but in general.

I definitely agree there, but at the same time - not everyone has a strong immune response to the vaccine (or to Covid).

Many (most?) breakthrough infection deaths are in these types of patients - those on immunosuppressants, with cancer, etc.

Since vaccines have strong protection from infection for the first 5-6 months, I would be fine with allowing vaccinated students to not mask.  However, for practical reasons this becomes very hard to police and is just another challenge for teachers.

[],,jdorje,,,[],,,,text,t2_ii7rl,False,False,[],"There was a study that I can never find anymore that claimed - and was very convincing - that antibody levels after 2-dose vaccination correlated nearly perfectly to chance of infection, but had no correlation to severity if infected.  And the correlation [applies smoothly across all vaccines](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01377-8).

We don't have as clear data on reinfection, but it does not seem to work the same way at all.  Antibodies were never as high after infection as after vaccination, and they also decay more slowly, but the chance of reinfection has not measurably risen.  The strong implication is that infection leads to enough cellular immunity to either prevent infection or fight it off before symptoms appear.

Antibodies are used here because they're really easy to measure.  We can do blood titration tests, where a simple blood sample is diluted until it reaches a cutoff for virus neutralization, and get a precise ""value"".  We can measure individual antibodies just by looking for specific proteins in the blood.  

Cellular immunity is at least as important, though; we just can't measure it well.  It's B cells that make those antibodies, after all, and T cells might be even more important in both detecting infection and killing infected cells.

No, I disagree with this. I am in the Seattle-area and no one is cautioning people - including and especially those fully vaccinated - to avoid gathering indoors. No one is avoiding gatherings with other fully vaccinated people anymore - whether indoors or outdoors. People are going to concert and events indoors without impasse with the only ""non-normal"" thing being wearing a mask while going to indoor events. No one is avoiding holiday gatherings and planning for a Zoom holiday gathering or one of those drive by holiday gatherings.  

The rest are true. We have mask mandates indoor and many people mask outdoors, many people still work from home (and hopefully will continue to do so at least in hybrid form).

* What is the efficacy rating from J&amp;J to Moderna?
* What is the efficacy rating from J&amp;J to Pzfier?
* Note that having J&amp;J and getting a J&amp;J boost, they're reporting efficacy from 72% to 94%.

This actually happens to a significant degree. The FDA often helps guide studies to ensure the results address the issues they will have. Speaking from personal experience, a study I wrote required FDA/LNE-GMED input and approval before we could start the full-fledged study. 

&gt; clear communication of, and pre-alignment on, outcome / efficacy thresholds for approval...

&gt;continuous alignment and updating of acceptable risk profiles for side effects vs outcomes

You think people have a problem now, imagine how it will be when new data makes them drastically redefine/tighten the acceptance criteria. What you want is in effect what happened when they requested the 2500 additional enrollees in the trial due to the risk of myocarditis and there were huge numbers of complaints (despite it being the correct move). In the end, what would the benefit of this be? The final acceptance criteria by which things are evaluated would not change appreciably from what they are now other than they would be MORE likely to paint themselves in a corner and not evaluate risk properly. 

&gt;transparent delivery and analysis of data in real-time between parties

Due to the nature of the process, analysis of the data before you have the whole set can actually be very dangerous. You can end up with HUGE mischaracterizations of what is occurring. I learned very early-on to let our data scientists handle how to perform accurate sampling, when possible, of early data because it is VERY easy to generate a false picture. 

&gt; use of 21st century statistical / AI technologies for data analysis

No offense but this uses a whole lot of words to say a whole lot of nothing. In chemistry, it's equivalent is ""the outcome of a reaction is the results of an interplay of physical and electronic effects"". 

The people performing the analysis are using the most modern methods possible. The amount of analysis they are doing behind the scenes is absolutely incredible, they are building models, processing the data in various constructs, etc. I get the feeling, you believe they aren't because their presentation isn't flashy (which is actually useless when you need to give data rich presentations). 

As for AI, it has its use cases but is totally inappropriate for bleeding-edge scenarios. Despite what people think, you don't just turn AI on a problem. You need datasets, you need to train the model, etc. etc. It is nigh impossible to train a model when you don't even know what the data says yet.",,,,1635269111,{},hi4zwo7,False,t3_qg6360,False,False,t1_hi49pnp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qg6360/fda_advisory_committee_meets_today_to_discuss_and/hi4zwo7/,1635424061.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before Polio was eliminated, I wonder if people thought ""We just need to wait for it to become like the flu!"" 

Every virus is different. COVID has different pathophysiology and clinical presentation than the flu, and I don't see why it would become just like the flu. 

Current studies are generally failing to find a reduction in CFR in reinfections. Vaccines have a very significant reduction in CFR, yet at the current rate,  the UK would be having ~35k fully vaccinated people die per year of COVID.

The data that Moderna presented to FDA was with 2 initial doses of Moderna at 100 mcg followed by a booster of 50 mcg.

Back when Moderna did their trials for Phase 3 (before being authorized):  They looked at 25 mcg, 50 mcg, 100 mcg and 250 mcg doses.   They found 250 mcg to be too toxic.  And the other lower doses to LACK sufficient immune response.  So 100 mcg was selected as OPTIMAL dose. 

The rationale for Moderna half dose is that the folks who got Moderna earlier already have been exposed to enough antigen, they just need a small boost to jog immune memory, and also they wanted to minimize side effects.

However, this is questionable for folks who got Pfizer and J&amp;J earlier.  Their immune response was NOWHERE near as robust as Moderna's.   That is why I believe, prescribing half a dose of Moderna may leave them unprotected.

This is data on kids with covid in the US. I haven‚Äôt updated it since 30th Sept but it would be easy to do:


This isn‚Äôt a study but rather is a summary of publicly reported data on all child cases since reporting began and the current outcomes. It‚Äôs from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children‚Äôs Hospital Association. 

https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/

https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP%20and%20CHA%20-%20Children%20and%20COVID-19%20State%20Data%20Report%209.30%20FINAL.pdf

In summary, data as of 30/9/21:

Since reporting began (up to 30/9/21) 5,899,148 children have tested positive in the US. 

Of those reported cases:

Up until 30/9/21, 520 have died (88 per million), which is 0.009% of total child cases

Up until 30/9/21, 22,429 have been hospitalised (3,802 per million), which is 0.380% of total child cases

Obviously the results aren‚Äôt complete as not all 5M+ cases have recovered so deaths and hospitalisations will end up higher than currently reported, but it still shows a very low risk to children. 

What the data doesn‚Äôt show:
- age breakdown
- what treatments or interventions were used
- what underlying conditions (if any) the children had
- how sick hospitalised children were (moderate vs severe)

Also, not all states reported on hospitalisations (around half) so this needs to be taken into consideration as the numbers would be higher.",,,,1635281500,{},hi5vscw,False,t3_qg7csz,False,False,t3_qg7csz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qg7csz/nyt_issues_correction_after_significantly/hi5vscw/,1635442958.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1) No one in the trials, both control or treatment, got severe symptoms. So there is **no data** to say whether it helps with severe symptoms. All we know is that it helps with cold-like symptoms. Do we really need to vaccinate all kids just to prevent cold-like symptoms?

2) The vaccine is known to wane over time. If I understand correctly, we are also giving children 1/3 of the adult dose with no second shot. What if the efficacy levels start to wane like J&amp;J, ie down to 3%? Will we keep giving boosters to kids every 6 months?

The state health department wants businesses and restaurants to implement mask or vaccine mandates to stem the spread of the coronavirus, but is preparing for the possibility that statewide action will be needed as Colorado‚Äôs hospitals continue to fill with COVID-19 patients, Dr. Eric France, chief medical officer for the agency, said Monday.  
Coronavirus hospitalizations are at their highest point since Christmas and officials with the state Department of Public Health and Environment believe Colorado could hit capacity by the end of November.  
Hospitals are already diverting ‚Äî or turning away ‚Äî¬† ambulances as their emergency rooms fill, France said.  
‚ÄúUltimately, we are trying to protect our hospital beds,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚ÄúMaybe we have to really work harder to have businesses require masks or ask restaurant owners to ask for proof of vaccination.‚Äù  
When asked whether the health department is considering taking action itself, France said ‚Äúpossibly.‚Äù He said the agency also hopes local officials will take steps to curb the spread of the virus.  
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre preparing for that possibility,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll track hospitalizations over the next week or two.‚Äù  
Larimer and Boulder counties have already reinstated indoor mask mandates.  
A handful of Denver businesses have required proof of vaccination to enter restaurants, bars and concert halls, but such mandates are not widespread. A majority of the vaccine mandates ‚Äî including the one by the city of Denver ‚Äî¬† in Colorado have so far focused on government, school and health care employees.  
There were 1,170 people hospitalized with confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Monday. Another 72 patients had potential infections, according to the latest data from the state health department. The last time more patients were receiving hospital care for COVID-19 was Christmas Eve.  
At the worst point, on Dec. 2, 1,995 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.  
As of Monday, 120 intensive-care beds were available and 88% of the state‚Äôs acute-care beds were filled, according to the data.  
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre certainly worried about hospital capacity for medical and surgical beds and that we might be at capacity by the end of November,‚Äù France said.  
So far, there‚Äôs no sign the worst is over. The state health department reported 15,260 cases in the week ending Sunday ‚Äî a quick rebound after a one-week drop. The percentage of tests coming back positive was at its highest level since Dec. 16, suggesting even that could be an undercount.  
In September, hospitals were admitting about 100 COVID-19 patients each day, but that‚Äôs risen to an average of 140, said Beth Carlton, an associate professor of environmental and occupational health at the Colorado School of Public Health. While fewer COVID-19 patients are hospitalized than at the worst point last year, hospitals are dealing with the surge on top of the normal mix of people needing care, she said.  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs already pretty bad,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think it could get worse.‚Äù

  
Nationwide, new cases and hospitalizations have dropped significantly, but Colorado has moved in the opposite direction, Carlton said. As of Monday, the state had the 11th-highest rate of new cases compared to population and the 14th-highest hospitalization rate, according to The New York Times.  
It‚Äôs not entirely clear why that‚Äôs happening, but several neighboring states in the northern mountains and plains are experiencing surges at the same time, Carlton said. Cooling weather could be a factor, or it might be that a surge in one place will spread to other undervaccinated communities and spill over to people whose immunity might be waning, she said.  
Hospitals began diverting ambulances 10 days ago, a move that is reminiscent of the scenes that took place during last year‚Äôs deadly third-wave.  
Public health officials are especially concerned that a normal flu season could further overwhelm hospitals.  
Public health orders issued last year to address transmission of the coronavirus suppressed the spread of influenza. But since they were lifted and people began gathering more often, doctors have reported more cases of typical illnesses, such as the common cold and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).  
It‚Äôs not unusual for a few thousand people to be hospitalized over the entire flu season, so that might lead to about 300 or so people needing beds for influenza in a matter of months, France said.  
France encouraged Coloradans to wear masks indoors and to get either vaccinated or receive their booster shot if they are already inoculated.  
People should also get their flu shot as a normal flu season, in which more people are hospitalized, ‚Äúmight be the straw that breaks the camel‚Äôs back,‚Äù he said.",,,,1635267521,{},hi4vv6y,True,t3_qgat3h,False,False,t3_qgat3h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qgat3h/colorado_prepares_for_possible_mask_vaccine/hi4vv6y/,1635421854.0,29,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,
