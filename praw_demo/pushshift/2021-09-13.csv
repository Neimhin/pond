To answer your last question, the FDA approved third doses of both Pfizer and Moderna for immunocompromised individuals, so you would be getting an approved 100ug for Moderna or 30ug for Pfizer.  The 50ug that Moderna is testing in their trials hasn't been approved yet, so it's much easier for the FDA to approve what's already out there and in use (100ug for Moderna and 30ug for Pfizer) than a new dosage which would require additional stuff by the FDA.   

You wouldn't have any issues getting either.

[],,michaelthecoder,,,[],,,,text,t2_llftk,False,True,,"There's two reasons that people currently feel booster shots might not be appropriate.

First, we have to weigh the risks and benefits of a booster for the individual. The risks of side effects might increase a bit, similar to how the second dose of the mRNA vaccines was rougher than the first for many people. The benefits will decrease, as the initial shot is still extremely effective at protecting death, and moderately effective at protecting from hospitalization. The booster shots in theory should boost effectiveness against illness and spreading a significant amount, but many experts believe that those are not worth considering.

To many non-scientists, so far the benefits appear to far outweigh the risks, but we still don't have much data since boosters are still pretty new. Often scientists are much more cautious than the public and want lots of data before definitively saying anything and would rather be too late to say something correct instead of saying something wrong initially.

Second, there is a concern that many people have that they feel booster shots are unethical, since using a shot as a booster is likely less effective in the worldwide war against COVID than giving that shot to another country to use.

Many people such as myself and likely the parent commenter are concerned that these experts are getting too caught up in their personal biases and because of the second reason are being much more negative about boosters than the first reason should warrant. This is especially true from anything from the WHO, who has been extremely negative about boosters solely due to this ethical concern and in my opinion has not done its duty and has ignored any research into positive effects that boosters may have out of this ethical concern.

In a few months if we get the data that shows boosters are a net positive, then the public will yet again feel the whiplash of how fast scientists change position on an issue. Its the mask argument all over again, where scientists are failing to do their duty to inform the public and tell the truth in a shortsighted goal to save lives by spinning the science to create the policy they want. Then, when the policy is no longer needed (for example, when hospitals have enough masks or other countries have enough vaccines), they will start telling the full truth to a public that trusts them far less.",,,,1631594240,{},hcs85aa,False,t3_pnfp6c,False,True,t1_hcroj4y,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pnfp6c/data_shows_covid_booster_shots_are_not/hcs85aa/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,39099e07822c3327f175fa9455291009e1cae5f2,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1631594255.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public

Consequences?

But in all seriousness, it's quite rare AFAIK that a fine makes you end up in Prison. If it does, you really wanted to be a dick about it (or you're *extremely* poor, but guess what, the shot is free).

My point is that the argument of ""We can't control 100% of it so it's not worth trying"" is usually dishonest.

&gt; All that is happening right now is mandates are exacerbating the problem. The harder the government pushes the harder the people here will push back.

Data shows this isn't true. More than 98% of the personnel in I-forgot-the-name hospital got vaccinated right after it became mandatory, although they were protesting about it.

Source? Here is one of the articles on the israeli data that claim the opposite: 
https://www.science.org/content/article/having-sars-cov-2-once-confers-much-greater-immunity-vaccine-vaccination-remains-vital


&gt; Antibody testing alone is to prone to failure with false positive/negatives

[Results indicate &gt; 90% sensitivity after at least 15 days post infection.](https://www.idsociety.org/covid-19-real-time-learning-network/diagnostics/antibody-testing/) That's pretty good. 

&gt; Differentiating infection acquired immunity vs. vaccine acquired immunity as one being 'natural' is a misnomer that really poisons the well in the discussion. The immune response is the same in both situations ( but the multidose mRna vaccine generally produces a stronger immune response )

This is actually not true. At all. mRNA vaccines only produce monolithic antibodies to the S2 subunit of the spike protein. Infection acquired immunity produces a whole host of other antibodies and those actually vary quite a bit person to person. And some are far, far better than others. [ For example the CV30 antibodies studied here were isolated from someone fighting covid infection.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19231-9) There are many more examples of this. [The most promising recent one is S309, which apparently kills off the original sars, covid, and even some cold coronaviruses extremely effectively.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2349-y). This is what's getting rolled into the new biologic sotrovimab. 

What we truly need at this point is 1 of 2 things, or ideally, both. 

1. A variant even more aggressive than delta where disease course is more mild that confers excellent immunity. 
2. Some medication that can trigger an IgA mucosal response to clear viral infections in the upper respiratory system, and stop the nasal and mouth based viral shedding infecting people.

To be clear here im not advocating against vaccines at all. I think the future is quite bright for the future mRNA cocktail mixed vaccines that will inevitably come about. 

But lets not go shitting on the immune system and act like our current mRNA covid vaccines are superior for the immune response generated. The science doesn't back that up.

The Israeli data also suggested that the best protection is achieved by natural infection, plus the vaccine. That is really the gold standard at this point. 

I just don't think we should discriminate against people who have had the infection naturally, already. They have the immune response that we desire for safer travel.",,,,1631629597,{},hctnnep,False,t3_pnv4wq,False,True,t1_hctji13,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pnv4wq/fauci_says_he_would_support_mandating_covid19/hctnnep/,1631733926.0,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are much fewer people on the streets and the masks have come back on. My workplace is now checking health codes and temperature on entry. Restaurants can still open but are mostly empty.

Hope this outbreak can be contained in Xianyou.

&gt;Results indicate &gt; 90% sensitivity after at least 15 days post infection. That's pretty good.

I agree, that is pretty good. But we're in a worldwide pandemic and relying on a single pretty good test isn't good enough particularly when there is effectively no reason someone couldn't get the vaccine which is easy to show proof of ( and a felony to forge ).  


&gt;This is actually not true. At all. mRNA vaccines only produce monolithic antibodies to the S2 subunit of the spike protein.

You are correct here on two parts; First, the literature references 'natural' in the same way as you did in your argument. Additionally, I thought that the two immune response were almost identical but that does not appear to be the case.  


&gt;1. A variant even more aggressive than delta where disease course is more mild that confers excellent immunity.  


I agree this would be ideal but unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any selection pressure for the virus to become less deadly as death usually occurs well after the peak of transmissibility.  


&gt;But lets not go shitting on the immune system and act like our current mRNA covid vaccines are superior for the immune response generated. The science doesn't back that up.  
  
The Israeli data also suggested that the best protection is achieved by natural infection, plus the vaccine. That is really the gold standard at this point.

There is compelling reason to believe that asymptomatic to mild cases are not as effective in antibody production as the vaccines. The single study out of Israel may turn out to be true but it's not enough to justify lax policies yet.

I agree that having had covid plus a vaccine is the current best immunological protection we have against the virus which, seems to me, an argument in favor of additional vaccine requirements.",,,,1631646909,{},hcuuoa2,False,t3_pnv4wq,False,True,t1_hctnnep,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pnv4wq/fauci_says_he_would_support_mandating_covid19/hcuuoa2/,1631756765.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

No that's not how any of this works.  No red tape was cut even once.  The only red tape that was cut at the time was FDA stopped all pending drug and vaccine approvals and shifted to only things that were focused on a solution to sars-cov-2.

&amp;#x200B;

The reasons vaccines took so long before is because of how little we spent, and how hard it was to find trial patients for any given vaccine.

&amp;#x200B;

you need 4 things to make a vaccine.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Money
2. Customers
3. Trial patients
4. Regulatory attention

Never before had a vaccine had so much money thrown at it all at once.  It's never happened like this.  Usually vaccines are SUPER LOW on the totem pole of drug company R&amp;D.  vaccines historically aren't big profit drivers.  But with the pandemic.  Drug companies also shifted as much money as they could shift.  Again, something that had never happened before all into a vaccine.  So that takes care of how the first item on our list sped things up because there's actually no comparison to anything about regarding a drug company throwing money at a vaccine.

A vaccine in modern medicine has never had the potential sheer number of orders that these covid vaccines do.  This reinforces number 1 because never before has a drug company been able to consider (we might be able to sell at least 2 doses of this stuff to 3/4th of the world population potentially within 12 months from going on sale.   How flu vaccines and tetanus shots used to sell don't even come close to the level of orders they were staring down with these vaccines.  These two things are literally half the battle.

Another thing that really sped things up, is generally.  Finding someone willing to take an experimental vaccine for something wasn't usually something most people would sign up to do.  We used to joke about how it was drug trials and selling sperm was the thing some poor people would have to do to make a little extra cash remember?  But this time.  Every drug company in the world suddenly had a list of 10's or 100's of thousands of people just lined up saying ""yes please, put experimental vaccine here thank you"".  Again, something that flatly has just never happened before.  What used to take a year or three to even put together was suddenly ready to go on day one.

Lastly, getting regulatory attention.  That being government bodies like the FDA to set aside the staff to look at your experimental vaccine used to need to be scheduled years in advance because of the sheer number of things their staff has to look at.  Everything from new toothpastes to new erectile dysfunction drugs was pretty normal for their day to day.  They're always backed up like at least 2 years.  But with covid, anything involving a covid solution became these governmental bodies 100% laser focus and everything that wasn't.  got postponed and delayed so they had staff to get right on this.  Again something that has never happened before.

The FDA didn't rush anything.  Every single way they could look at it scientifically and responsibly was done.  Not a single corner cut in what they did.  It was everything else that was sped up.  It really helped them make probably their most informed scientific recommendation because I'm pretty sure this was the largest drug trial for a vaccine in human history.  Never before has a vaccine had the sheer number of participants which makes solidifying data SO MUCH EASIER.  

so yeah there were able to whip this stuff out faster than anyone has ever seen but.  Again, there were super reasonable reasons for that.  Vaccine development was probably never going to get this kind of attention any other way because as a global population, all things considered.  We mostly didn't give a flying fuck about it until all this pandemic stuff happened.",,,,1631646531,{},hcutq5r,False,t3_po5e79,False,True,t1_hcuh9vt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/po5e79/moderna_combines_covid_flu_rsv_vaccines_in_single/hcutq5r/,1631756277.0,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,tentkeys,,,[],,,,text,t2_2ppp8j5,False,False,[],"Efficacy isn’t percent chance you will/won’t get it, it’s percent reduction in cases.

Suppose we have 1000 vaccinated people and 1000 unvaccinated people. Let’s say they are clinical trial participants who don’t know their vaccine status, so there is no difference in exposure risk-taking between groups.

If 50 of the unvaccinated people get sick, we assume that means that approximately 50 vaccinated people would have gotten sick had they not been vaccinated. So if only 20 vaccinated people actually got sick, the vaccine prevented 30 out of 50 potential cases, giving it 60% efficacy.

Note that only 20 out of 1000 vaccinated people in this hypothetical example got sick, so that’s only 2% breakthrough cases, despite the 60% efficacy. That’s because, based on infection rates in the **un**vaccinated, we estimated that only 50 out of every 1000 people were exposed to circumstances that had the potential to lead to infection (during the time period we observed). The other 950 vaccinated people weren’t exposed, so them not getting sick doesn’t factor into efficacy calculations.

The only time the efficacy numbers and the breakthrough numbers will match up is if 100% of the unvaccinated get sick. If all 1000 unvaccinated people got sick and all 1000 vaccinated people were exposed to the same circumstances, then with 60% vaccine efficacy we would expect 400 breakthrough cases (40%) among the vaccinated.

But as long as there are circumstances allowing some unvaccinated people to not get exposed/get sick during a particular time period, that means there are also some vaccinated people not getting exposed. And any vaccinated person who doesn’t get exposed can’t become a breakthrough case. So then you can have a vaccine with 60% efficacy but still have way less than 40% of vaccinated people becoming breakthrough cases.

I would skip the football games and large crowds/parties/etc., but would feel fine staying in the dorm I think. if you have the option to skip university housing and get your own place, that could be better (and worse, for other reasons).

the NBA finals were in my city and I skipped going to a game because delta was starting to rage. I still hang out with some friends and stuff, but avoid large crowds (not that I liked them too much before). I'm skipping a concert next month that I probably would have gone to a couple years ago (though it's a stadium concert, and I don't want to sit down at a concert either).

it's true if your roommate (or your hallmates) gets it, you're likely to get infected. being a vaccinated young person, you're highly likely to be fine. But if you go to a football game with tens of thousands of people, you will be around infected people, and the disease will spread and mutate.

one thing I remember about college is coming down with something every year. due to the brutal American culture of going to work sick due to lack of paid time off, going to class sick so your grades don't sink and you need that internship, etc., people would come to class to cough for an hour, and it sucked. if nothing else, I at least hope this whole experience incentivizes us to create systems/infrastructure that allow us to stay home when sick so we don't spread our germs to everyone else.

[],,michaelthecoder,,,[],,,,text,t2_llftk,False,False,[],"Quite possibly. Here's a very complicated answer to that question delving into the thought behind US politics:

Something to understand is the two very different approaches to novel science that we have seen play out throughout the pandemic. One is to make assumptions early on and then stick with those unless data strongly proves you wrong. The second is to make the best guess you can at the time even though that guess might be based on bad data.

The CDC and FDA have been sticking with the first approach. In theory, the benefit to this approach is less changing of directions creating more public trust. Either your assumption is right and you don't have to change directions at all, or your assumption is wrong and you change directions once. Whereas with the second approach you risk unclear data causing you to constantly waffle back and forth on how to proceed.

In practice though, this has spectacularly backfired as the CDC and FDA have constantly been wrong in the face of obvious data only to have to backtrack well after everyone else has been aware of the new info. This happened with whether masks were useful, whether the virus was airborne, and whether vaccinated people needed to wear masks. In each of these, the answer was plainly obvious well before the CDC and FDA had to backtrack and admit they were completely wrong.

My point is that this is exactly what is happening again with mixing vaccines. All data I've seen is that mixing vaccines is safe and more effective. This IS NOT a guarantee that it is though (and I am not personally advocating it as that is between you and your doctor), since our data is still limited. Most countries are going with the second approach, the ""well this is the best info we have right now, so we will trust the data even if it is limited"". The CDC and FDA on the other hand have started with the assumption that vaccine mixing is unsafe because it has not been studied and their minds will not be changed until they see hard data. 

So with all that said, the summary is that vaccine mixing is probably more effective, but that because it is not a guarantee and because of the approach that the CDC and FDA are taking, you will not hear it from them until far after everyone else believes it to be a good idea.",,,,1631654601,{},hcvdwv4,False,t3_pnfp6c,False,True,t1_hcva0wv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pnfp6c/data_shows_covid_booster_shots_are_not/hcvdwv4/,1631766730.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

So here's my obligatory ""I'm fully vaxxed"", but I also work with kids and other high risk situations. I've got a molecular iodine rinse (like dentists have patients use before cleanings now to avoid Covid transmission) and a molecular iodine nasal spray from the same company in case I'm ever exposed. Molecular iodine rinses keep the ""killer"" iodine at very low ppm while foregoing the toxic iodine present in Betadine or other iodine solutions. Since the virus is known to sometimes totally wipe away taste or smell, or pervert it enough that the person doesn't even want to eat and loses weight, it seems like a low-risk, potentially medium- to high-reward treatment in the event of exposure.

Even without exposure, molecular iodine rinse is safe to use every day, unlike Betadine, which you should only use for a week or so.

Since the article had that lovely semi-racist insinuation that someone from Bangladesh couldn't possibly know what they're doing, here's something from good ol' US of A: https://today.uconn.edu/2020/06/uconn-health-researchers-find-simple-oral-rinse-can-inactivate-covid-19-virus/ And yes, I know, this was an ""in the laboratory"" experiment, but again, I feel us people with relatively high potential exposure should feel comfortable using low-risk, potentially high-reward treatments that have some evidence in their favor.",,,,1631589176,{},hcrygk9,False,t3_pnsjsk,False,True,t3_pnsjsk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pnsjsk/antivaxxers_are_now_gargling_iodine_to_prevent/hcrygk9/,1631700366.0,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

I read the following in an AP News article recently: ""despite more than 208 million Americans having at least one dose of the vaccines, the U.S. is seeing about 300% more new COVID-19 infections a day, about two-and-a-half times more hospitalizations, and nearly twice the number of deaths compared to the same time last year.""

  
I have people in my life who are vaccinated but skeptical on certain Covid mandates like the helpfulness of masks (especially for children) and have come to me genuinely wondering how so many Americans are vaccinated and yet Covid is apparently way worse than a year ago.  
As with many things in life, surely there's a plethora of reasons--more preventative mandates a year ago than now and therefore less spread back then, the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant now, etc. 

  
I also think the above quote is kind of unhelpful because some states seem to be doing so much worse than others--so to lump them all together isn't giving a clear picture.

  
All of this is to ask...does anyone have any recommendations on resources that attempt to give helpful, science-based explanations as to what's going on?

Now comparing my shots to my siblings and Mom is key here. We all got 2 shots of Pfizer. However our reactions were vastly different.

My siblings both had good amounts of fatigue, muscle soreness, and headaches for a solid day if not a little into the second day. Which is also how my Mother reacted to her shots as well.

Me and my father? We had slight fatigue, some very mild soreness, and a small achey headache that when treated preemptively with headache medicine on the front end when it was juuust noticeable was basically a non ailment. All done within a day.

That time period between our initial bad sickness which we think was covid, and also our shots was a decent amount. (My timeframes fucked due to this pandemic year so I'm not going to give solid dates, because I know for a fact I'll mess them up)

I didn't get JJ originally, but I did switch from Pfizer to Moderna. What I did was fill out the  CVS appointment saying I'm immunocompromised, got Moderna last time. Then when I went in, 'Crap I'm sorry I forgot my vaccine card, can you just give me one with the booster, I can keep it with my other one.""

You might be able to do that or just say it's your second shot and Moderna was your first.

Personally I'm glad I didn't wait. Moderna is lowering their booster dose. They seem to want a trade-off of less severe side effects in exchange for possibly reducing longevity; their 100ug dose was almost certainly why they've not dropped off as much as Pfizer yet. I understand the argument for that, but personally even with the rare high grade fevers I got, I wouldn't risk less durable protection.

Human doses include topical creams to treat Rosacea and pills to treat parasitic diseases like River Blindness (which are much more common in the tropics than in the continental US, so they're not a very common prescription here). The doses which had anti-viral properties in vitro were much lower than the FDA-approved doses in pills meant to treat parasitic diseases.

Since the fringe folks couldn't get their hands on human medications, they've been going to feed shops and buying up veterinary Ivermectin which is meant to kill parasites in pets or livestock. Those meds may contain fillers which aren't approved for human consumption, and are often provided in doses which are meant for much larger animals like horses and cows.

I suspect that part of the ""rationale"" for some people who take it is that they're familiar with it from its animal uses.

In other words it helps prevent infected people from spewing viral particles because their mouth has been temporarily sanitized.

It may also have some role as an emergency prophylaxis if you are exposed.  Say, you are a medical person and a Covid patient coughs in your face.  Hold your breath, wash your face and rinse your mouth and nostrils to hopefully reduce the viral load to the point your immune system can handle it.  But I'm not at all sure about that and would put it in the catagory of ""maybe better than nothing"".

What I do not think is that if you wander around all day unvaxxed l, exposing yourself to the virus, and you come home and give yourzelf a good iodine mouth and nose rinse, it will kill enough of the virus that has decided to hang out in your oral mucousa.  I'm pretty sure that if any significant viral dose gets into contact with your oral mucousa, it will be a matter of minutes -at best- before the virus moves into your lower airway.

I haven't looked at similar studies of ethyl alcohol, but it wouldn't surprise me if you could get a similar effect from gargling something like Everclear, peroxide or chlorhexidine.  Yeah, you COULD carry some around and if you have close contact with someone, immediately try gargling.  There's some evidence it might help.  But this seems like saying ""Instead of wearing a bulletproof vest while people are shooting at me, I'm just going to rely on running and zigzagging"".  Might it help? Yeah, but it's fucking stupid and won't do shit when that sniper draws a bead on you.  So get the vaccine and wear a mask.

Povidone-iodine solution as SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis for procedures of the upper aerodigestive tract a theoretical framework

Journal of Otolaryngology - Head &amp; Neck Surgery volume 49, Article number: 77 (2020) Cite this article

Abstract
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns of inadvertent SARS-CoV-2 transmission to healthcare workers during routine procedures of the aerodigestive tract in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Current efforts to mitigate this risk focus on Personal Protective Equipment, including high-efficiency filtration as well as other measures.

Because the reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 shedding is in the nasopharynx and nasal and oral cavities, the application of viricidal agents to these surfaces may reduce virus burden. Numerous studies have confirmed that povidone-iodine inactivates many common respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Povidone-iodine also has good profile for mucosal tolerance. Thus, we propose a prophylactic treatment protocol for the application of topical povidone-iodine to the upper aerodigestive tract.

Conclusion
Such an approach represents a low-cost, low-morbidity measure that may reduce the risks associated with aerosol-generating procedures performed commonly in otorhinolaryngology operating rooms.

Some postmenopausal women shared stories about getting their periods for the first time in years. Many wondered whether the vaccines might be the reason.
Now researchers at five institutions, backed by funding from the National Institutes of Health, will be conducting yearlong studies to examine any possible connections between vaccination and irregular menstruation, and to help allay concerns that might prevent women from getting their shots.

The evidence around abnormal periods is so far purely anecdotal. There is no known link between vaccination and changes in menstruation, and public health experts reiterate that vaccines are safe, effective and necessary to end the pandemic.

But the stories underpin a persistent data gap about reproductive health and women’s menstrual cycles that is not collected during clinical trials, including during trials of the Covid vaccines. There have also been no scientific studies published examining a potential relationship between the two.

“This is an important, overlooked issue,” said Dr. Hugh Taylor, chair of the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at Yale School of Medicine, who added that he has heard from his own patients about differences in their periods after receiving the vaccine.

“A lot of people have irregular menstruation for all sorts of reasons, so is this really different in people with the vaccine, or is it just that when people have it, they are linking it to the vaccine?”

The research will be undertaken by teams at Boston University, Harvard Medical School, Johns Hopkins University, Michigan State University and Oregon Health and Science University. The studies will include participants of all ages and backgrounds who have not yet been vaccinated, including those who plan to get the shots and those who do not, in order to study their menstrual cycles before and afterward.

Menstrual health can be a reflection of women’s overall health, doctors say. But they point out that a number of different factors can temporarily affect a woman’s period, including stress, illness or lifestyle changes. Periods, including length and flow of a menstrual cycle, also vary widely from person to person.",,,,1631614888,{},hcsxgrm,True,t3_pnzu14,False,False,t1_hcswgrp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pnzu14/researchers_will_study_whether_the_vaccines/hcsxgrm/,1631719237.0,28,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Daughter came home from school with a mild cough and breathing in made her feel nauseated. She'd left symptomless.

We're still keeping her home though - I'm not going to be the one who sends their sick kid to class to get their classmates sick, even if it's ""just"" RSV. Someone's going to get both RSV and covid, and that's pretty dangerous.

Not to mention, everyone who gets sick will have to stay home until they get tested. There's just no real justification to send a sick kid to school regardless of what they're sick with.

funding is important yes, but no amount of funding can expedite the clinical testing period because you need to wait for the efficacy data (exception is when funding is used to recruit more volunteers).

No, because major pharma company or academic institution don't lack funds to publish/read. Regardless, point is very much tied with funding anyways.

Economy/education/public perception/supply issues/business interests have been the main drivers behind decisions rather than public health.  

I've been called nuts on this by criticizing the government decision to stop collecting numbers of people who were vaccinated and got covid back in May.  I truly think they stopped collecting the data because they didn't want it to interfere with messaging that the vaccines were amazing. 

  And here we are several months later not having collected the data going ""we just don't have the data to say it's not as effective"", well no shit, you made that decision to not get the data.  Some states are collecting that info on their own. I think that internally they may have their own numbers but they just haven't shared them because they don't want public perception to be anything other than the ""vaccines are amazing"".  

They have been good but it's clear from Israeli studies we need boosters. The cdc is sitting on their thumbs just hoping that denying that the effectiveness wanes that people who haven't been vaccinated yet will suddenly change their minds is infuriating.  Yet another decision based on group psychology rather than public health.


Hope your corner continues to stay not horrible.  I personally think that school spread will be the thing that kicks off another round of northern covid shit show.

https://www.science.org/content/article/having-sars-cov-2-once-confers-much-greater-immunity-vaccine-vaccination-remains-vital


&gt; Antibody testing alone is to prone to failure with false positive/negatives

[Results indicate &gt; 90% sensitivity after at least 15 days post infection.](https://www.idsociety.org/covid-19-real-time-learning-network/diagnostics/antibody-testing/) That's pretty good. 

&gt; Differentiating infection acquired immunity vs. vaccine acquired immunity as one being 'natural' is a misnomer that really poisons the well in the discussion. The immune response is the same in both situations ( but the multidose mRna vaccine generally produces a stronger immune response )

This is actually not true. mRNA vaccines only produce monolithic antibodies to the S2 subunit of the spike protein. Infection acquired immunity produces a whole host of other antibodies and those actually vary quite a bit person to person.[ For example the CV30 antibodies studied here were isolated from someone fighting covid infection.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19231-9) There are many more examples of this. 

What we truly need at this point is 1 of 2 things, or ideally, both. 

1. A variant even more aggressive than delta where disease course is more mild that confers excellent immunity.

There is still chance, although reduce chance, for long covid.  Recent UK study showed only 50% reduction of long covid for fully vaccinated person if infected.

2)  There is no easy test for Memory B or Memory T.  Unless there is one, it is no way to know if one has sufficiently Memory Cell to fight Covid.  I have a coworker who is full vaccinated died of covid even though she looks very health for someone in the 50s.

It's more complex than this.

(1) Reduced efficacy can reflect a reduction of antibodies while T and B cells remain capable of producing antibodies on demand.

(2) Each person's immune system response is unique, there is almost certainly covid-infected individuals who had a weak immune response that puts their body's defense system at less readiness than vaccine immunity equipped individuals -- and vice versa.

(3) **This is how natural immunity works.** You body does not maintain antibodies for every naive infection ever, they are stored away in T and B cells causing them to work less effectively. The timing of this has to do with age, the severity of the infection, and a bunch of stuff we don't know.

Okay but so what? We have ridiculously high estimates of long covid like 80% which probably aren’t true in any meaningful sense. Or in other words, there’s ridiculous indefensible BS at the fringe of any topic. I never use that figure when I talk about long Covid, most serious people don’t.

Even if it’s 10%, a 10% chance of potentially irreversible or at least very long lasting and very life altering sequela, in a disease that *everyone will eventually catch,* is astronomical. Add to that the fact that we can’t stratify who is at risk of it very well, or why it occurs, and still lack reliable treatment for it. That is a bad proposition.

Strep throat has way less than a 1% chance of causing lifelong complications through rheumatic or Scarlett fever, but that outcome is rightly viewed as extremely undesirable, and this is the reason antibiotics ASAP are indicated for strep cases.

Of course they did - I'm not disputing that.  Also, it's only half the quote - I went on to say ""and shouldn't ever be prioritised over other patients"".

My point wasn't that they're not responsible for their condition, or even in fact that they shouldn't be de-prioritised.  It was that deciding on that basis is a moral decision and not within the scope of medical triage, which is what the comment above was implying.  I'm not saying it's right or wrong, just that it's not ""triage medicine"".

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;They also have a vastly lower chance of survival

Now that's not quite true.  It's rightthat someone who hasn't been vaccinated has a vastly lower chance of survival compared to if they had been, but that's because they have a much higher risk of becoming seriously ill.  However, it doesn't follow that two Covid patients who are similarly unwell and at the point of ICU admission have different chances of recovery depending on whether or not they have been vaccinated, just that a vaccinated patient is far less likely to get to that point in the first place.

So if you're triaging admissions to ICU, then whether or not someone has been vaccinated doesn't at that point affect their chances of survival.  Prioritising on that basis therefore isn't a medical decision, but a moral one.

&gt;Thirty-three cases have been reported among students and 50 among teachers.

&gt;""Our buildings are safe,"" Schools Chancellor Meisha Ross Porter said. ""The acknowledgment of cases is an acknowledgment of the added layers of safety and protection.""

&gt;The good news is that no school has been fully shut down or has multiple cases under investigation, but there are dozens of positive cases and dozens of schools with one or more close classrooms.

&gt;Of the roughly one million students in the public school system, attendance was at more than 82% -- lower than pre-pandemic years, which was more than 90% in 2019.

&gt;But as expected, it was higher than last year when just over 80% showed up for both in-person and remote learning.

&gt;""This is really good number for the first day, and it's going to grow rapidly in the coming days,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said.

&gt;Vaccinated teachers who test positive will require a 10-day quarantine, and the city's vaccine mandate is also expanding to include charter schools not located in Department of Education buildings.

&gt;Most of these 200 or so charter schools, though, had already come up with vaccine protocols and mandates.

&gt;Meanwhile, in Foley Square Monday night, educators argued against the city's vaccination requirement.

&gt;Judge David Hurd in Utica issued the order after 17 health professionals, including doctors and nurses, claimed in a lawsuit Monday that their rights were violated with a vaccine mandate that disallowed the exemptions.

&gt;The judge gave New York state until Sept. 22 to respond to the lawsuit in federal court in Utica. If the state opposes the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary court order blocking the vaccine mandate, a Sept. 28 oral hearing will occur.

&gt;The state issued the order Aug. 28, requiring at least a first shot for health care workers at hospitals and nursing homes by Sept. 27.

&gt;In their lawsuit, health care professionals disguised their identities with pseudonyms such as “Dr. A.,” “Nurse A.,” and “Physician Liaison X.”

&gt;They cited violations of the U.S. Constitution, along with the New York State Human Rights Law and New York City Human Rights Law, because the state Department of Health regulation requiring workers to get the vaccine provided no exemption for “sincere religious beliefs that compel the refusal of such vaccination.”

&gt;The court papers said all of the available vaccines employ aborted fetus cell lines in their testing, development or production.

&gt;The lawsuit said the plaintiffs wanted to proceed anonymously because they “run the risk of ostracization, threats of harm, immediate firing and other retaliatory consequences if their names become known.”

&gt;The plaintiffs, all Christians, included practicing doctors, nurses, a nuclear medicine technologist, a cognitive rehabilitation therapist and a physician’s liaison who all oppose as a matter of religious conviction any medical cooperation in abortion, the lawsuit said.

&gt;It added that they are not “anti-vaxxers” who oppose all vaccines.",,,,1631650169,{},hcv2xd8,True,t3_poai97,False,False,t3_poai97,/r/Coronavirus/comments/poai97/judge_temporarily_blocks_medical_worker_vaccine/hcv2xd8/,1631761050.0,13,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This summer demonstrated that only very very hight vaccination rates are effective containing the virus. Spain failed to do so during August with 60-70% vaccinated.

So did Portugal and UK. 

It of course helps, Spanish wave was huge (2nd biggest so far of 5 total) but fatalities were low (2nd lowest so far). But 60-70% is not enough for avoiding hospital pressure.

And the issue here is that most countries cannot reach 70% vaccination. Due to demographics or due to anti-vaxers.

There’s plenty of disagreement. Epidemiologists, who mostly inform public health agencies recommendations and the media, do often say that delta is more transmissible but with no direct evidence, it’s just inferred from the data. But they will all admit it’s far from certain why delta is more fit.  

&gt; Three separate countries, and the UK info is that herd Immunity isn't even possible because unlike the Measles vaccine which prevents you from becoming contagious entirely, the Coronavirus vaccine does not.

So, first of all, there is no evidence *yet* that the major covid vaccines don’t in fact reduce spread to near nil. There just isn’t and it doesn’t matter what they say otherwise until this is established first. No one should believe these claims without evidence regardless of who makes them. 

Just ask yourself how does delta spread more? See if you can find *any* thing that establishes *how* it does this.

[],,ceddya,,,[],,,,text,t2_c4wiu,False,False,[],"&gt; Well you more than welcome to offer an argument as to why forced vaccination is both constitutional and morally right. Go ahead ... I’ll wait.

Because vaccines aren't forced. You can choose not to work at places that require them. Or you can get tested every week.

Not only, MMR and Chickenpox vaccines have been mandated for a long time. Funny how people don't complain about those because they weren't politicized.

&gt;Florida has been doing just fine. The unemployment rate is moving nicely in the right direction and people seem upbeat and hopeful about the future.

You can say that in places with much higher vaccination rates.

Meanwhile, Florida saw a massive surge at a point when vaccines were widely available, causing **unnecesasry** deaths and strain on its healthcare system. Who cares if doctors or nurses are overworked though, right?

&gt;The vaccinated in Florida are feeling just peachy because we know we hardly have anything to worry about.

How lucky it must be for you to have other frontline workers shoulder your burden. But maybe consider that they shouldn't have to.

It's not just about *you*. Teachers shouldn't be forced to teach in unsafe environments. Retail workers shouldn't be forced to interact with so many unvaccinated individuals. Nurses and doctors shouldn't have to shoulder a disproportionate and massive burden via the consequences of someone else's choice to not get vaccinated.

&gt;And we don’t really care if kids mask in school because kids, even when unvaccinated, are even less at risk than healthy vaccinated adults.

Yeah, except their teachers aren't safe.

&gt;We follow the lead of the British who have actually done studies on the very real harm masks are having on kids.

The UK doesn't need a mask mandate because they have a much higher vaccination rate.

Also, **why don't you link the studies showing the harms associated with masks?** Don't bother replying until you do.

&gt;We aren’t easily manipulated by political hack organizations like the teachers unions that have the CDC by the balls.

https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-08-16/four-teachers-in-same-florida-county-die-of-covid-19-within-24-hours

Yeah, these teachers should just stop dying so that your narrative can be true.

&gt;bullshit draconian policies that are designed to protect idiots from themselves while massively inconveniencing everyone else for absolutely no reason.

If you are vaccinated, then the mandate has no effect on you. What exactly are you complaining about again? Lmao.

&gt;country where people have the freedom to make a different choice than you regarding their own health.

Yes, they do, they just don't get to violate the NAP. Notice how no big businesses have complained about this mandate?

Now there are ways to get some level of connection digitally and that is much better than nothing, but it is still destructive to your physical and mental health.

As far as dying, when I'm dead I won't really have many feelings about the matter so I don't really consider my own death to be that bad of a thing. I just would like to avoid it because I have things I enjoy that I don't want to give up. It's also extraordinarily unlikely that I will die of covid. For people in my age range who are unvaccinated less than .02% will die or covid. Vaccination reduces that risk by over 90% taking it down to .002%. My diet reduces my risk of severe covid by 73% taking that down to at worst .00054%. I wear a mask when in public, I still isolate, I'm female, etc etc. I have so many mitigating risk factors to the point that my risk of dying of covid is not something to actually be concerned about. It's not impossible but it's not more likely than getting hit by a bus and drowning in my own internal bleeding.

What I am concerned about is developing a long term disability/organ damage from covid which happens in 40% of cases including those that are mild and asymptomatic. While death is not an outcome I will have much to say about, being unable to do the things I currently enjoy would be a seriously bad outcome. 

I'm also willing and able to make sacrifices for those around me who will have a worse time with covid than I would 

However, my mental and physical health have suffered greatly from 18 months of isolation. I'm not going to deny this to seem invulnerable or make it seem like it was no big deal. I also know that lying about that reality won't convince anyone to return to isolation, espeically this late in the game, especially when everything about it is highly partisan and the media, government, health bodies, employers, and everything else has yo-yoed us around for the entire time about what, when, how, where. Their incompetence inspires people to give up trying. Their clear unwillingness to protect us, which is their job, makes people give up. Their partisanship makes people give up.

I actually think we who have followed the rules are owed something by society for this sacrifice, but I know we will never be compensated in any way for doing so. They won't even cover a gym membership or an appointment with a therapist, when at least the latter should be free for everyone always. If isolation hasn't negatively impacted you that's really great, but it has negatively impacted almost everyone who has done it because that's how the human body and mind works and the conditions it evolved under. I think it's not only silly but hurts the goal of ending the acute phase of covid by lying about that.",,,,1631622791,{},hct984w,False,t3_png909,False,True,t1_hcs1cwx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/png909/were_asking_the_impossible_of_vaccines_complete/hct984w/,1631725992.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,thezerothmisfit,,,[],,,,text,t2_kbxu7,False,True,,"Its kind of a half and half yes and no. 

For individual protection from breakthrough infections by delta, the answer is yes. The ""dwindling of efficacy"" that's being reported is less do the actual effectiveness of the vaccines, and more so due to the fact that the variants (what we call VOCs; variants of concern) became dominant. The vaccines we made, we made from the first available sequence which was released online, open access by Chinese researchers in early January. The development took about a month and the rest of the year was spent testing it. 

At this point that original strain is no longer in circulation, nor has been for a long time.  So our anti-Spike antibodies from the vaccines are no longer specific to the spike from the strains we would catch now. However they are still specific enough that they will still neutralize assuming there are a lot. The best chance for protection is to keep a high level of these non specific antibodies, at least until the second generation vaccines come out that are much more specific and broad range, which will be a 2022 sort of venture, as they are currently in testing as of now.

The other problem we face is vaccine equity. Only the wealthy, westernized countries have access to large quantities of stock, and the privileged liberty of refusal in face of that large stock. On top of that, they are most in control of that stock too and who is allowed to get it. As far as the pandemic is concerned there are far more countries who haven't had 10% of their population vaccinated than there are countries reaching anywhere near that magic herd immunity threshold. It would be better to have given 7 billion people 1 dose than to have had pockets of immunity surrounded by seas of pestilence. And it's not like we will close all borders to western countries while we wait for the rest of the people to die, that's absurd, unethical, and immoral.

Antivaccine sentiment is another issue. It's usually characterized as a western sentiment, but it is not purely that. The caricatures we see in memes and on TV are usually  working class Americans or Europeans being grifted by someone who definitely got vaccinated. But in a lot of the ""global south"" trust in vaccines is very low, particularly due to forced medical colonialism from the last few centuries of conquest. So even if we could provide everyone with a single vaccine, we can't ensure that enough people around the world will take it to the point that we hit global herd immunity.

So it's a complex issue. I live in America, and here we have about 63% with at least one dose. Which correlates to antibody levels similar to having caught a mild to moderate disease, but of the original strain. That second vaccine dose doubles or quadruples those antibody levels compared to those who have had natural infection immunity. But that number is only 54%. There's obviously an overlap here In people who have also had covid. Think 95% of Healthcare workers have been double vaxed, and a large proportion of them have also caught covid on the job. Those people don't some how fill in the burden of the herd immunity from the unvaccinated population. 

It's really hard to say. Personally I would take a third dose, for sure, especially since my taking it would not be stealing it form someone else. Those batches were already allotted to my state and my demographic, and if I don't get it, i risk that dose being thrown out America is doing with millions of doses. But if they were to only give them to the most at risk (immunocompromised people and older people do not develop or retain the same immune response as their healthier/younger counterparts) I would be okay with that too. The vaccines are still massively effective against the Delta variant, along with the other dozens. They are saving people's lives even if they do catch covid. But there are more unvaccinated people on earth than vaccinated, and we can't end the pandemic just by clearing the American public (which on its own is still far off). 

At the moment, the cause of delta spread in your personal community is forced by the unvaccinated, and as long as there's a large population of them, more strains will develop. They basically are working like walking ecosystems for this virus to thrive in, because it does not thrive in vaccinated people, even if it does make some of them sick.

Sure, and they should be (and are being) told not to drink it.

* **Response bias issues**: we can't even accurately measure who people will vote for, let alone how they *feel* on any given day. Any physician worth their salt will tell you that people run the gamut in terms of how accurately they measure their own health and well-being. 
   * **Agreement Bias:** And along this vein, how many times have you asked a kid if they have ""x"" condition and they say yes to be agreeable? Even adolescents will sometimes say yes just because. TONS of issues with surveying kids in this fashion. Kids and agreement bias go together like peanut butter bans and schools. 
   * **Mood Bias:** Kids are being showered in stressful bullshit right now. Of course some of them will have somatic manifestations.

The way I see it, I don't have a problem with a doctor trying ivermectin back in Fall of 2020, right after the first study was published.  But any doctor recommending ivermectin *now* needs to be stopped because the community has fully studied and found no benefit.  Timing and context matter for these things.

Non-pharmaceutical measures like distancing, masks, hand hygiene, tracing app, frequent fresh air all keep being relevant. Our vaccination rate is too low for that. They did comprehensive modelling depending on vaccination rate and shown scenarios.

it has to be understood that small % differences means a lot in tackling covid. just as an R factor of 0,9 and one of 1,1 is a huge difference, so is a vaccination rate of 65% vs 75%

if only 65% (12-59yo) would vaccinate they expect an incidency of 400 and more than 6.000 intensive care beds, a 75% acceptance would reduce incidency to 150 and 2.000 beds, 85% would keep incidency under 100, 95% under 50 and beds under 1.000

&gt; On the basis of the mathematical models presented here and the results of the surveys on vaccination acceptance, we consider a target vaccination rate (vaccination protection through full vaccination) of 85% for 12–59 year olds and 90% for people aged 60 and over necessary and also achievable. If this vaccination quota is reached in time, a pronounced 4th wave in the coming autumn / winter seems unlikely, provided that the population continues to adhere to the basic hygiene measures in addition to vaccination and, if the number of infections increases again, reduces contacts to a certain extent. https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2021/Ausgaben/27_21.pdf?__blob=publicationFile

Basically, if the virus gets in, whatever antibodies you do have attack it, while the immune system starts cranking out more of them, and produces T &amp; B cells from its stored copies. Since that can take a few days, if you don’t have enough antibodies, you might end up symptomatic, but once the T &amp; B cells kick in, you’ll start to improve.

&gt; Despite more than a year spent spreading misinformation about a pandemic that has killed more than 650,000 Americans, she has what might be considered a professional clean bill of health with no complaints, disciplinary actions or malpractice lawsuits on her record. The California Medical Board, which oversees her license, told NPR it expects doctors to ""follow the standard of care when treating patients at all times."" But the medical board declined to say whether it was investigating Gold, citing reasons of confidentiality.

&gt; Gold is not the only physician promoting misinformation while avoiding professional censure. NPR looked at medical licenses for 16 doctors, including Gold, who have proven track records of doing so online and in media interviews. Fifteen of the 16 had active licenses in good standing. One appeared to have let his license expire, but there was no suggestion in his record that it was because of any disciplinary action.

&gt; Now, some organizations affiliated with medical licensing are encouraging action.

By May infections were collapsing. Delta changed that. The post Delta world looks different. We'll eventually arrive at herd immunity but through infection rather then vaccination. And it will take much longer. My guess is that the remainder of this year will be a roller coaster but gradually during 2022 enough people will have immunity through infection (and possibly reinfection for some infected in 2020) that long lasting herd immunity will slowly develop. I think during 2022 we'll see infections stabilise and gradually decline so that by the end of that year some long lasting herd immunity will be established in the populations of some countries.

You do know that all medicines are made of CHEMICALS, right?

&gt;You will still most likely not be iodine deficient even if you do not consume iodized salt, as it’s naturally found in a diverse healthy diet.

But they still iodize salt just in case, because there are plenty of places in the world that don't have access to a diverse, healthy diet. Just to be clear, we're in agreement: it's a CHEMICAL that is also something that we need to ingest in very small amounts in order to prevent certain disorders. Quick question, when we ingest something (like a CHEMICAL) that we would be unhealthy without ingesting, what type of qualities do we say that thing has? Would those be *medicinal* qualities? 

&gt;The issue is that people are INGESTING iodine.

A problem which I have stated repeatedly. I'm not sure why you keep implying I didn't.

&gt;If you want to gargle with surgical scrub instead of practicing regular oral hygiene, good for you.

...not sure where you got that from.

&gt;I can only imagine the disruption of normal oral flora and development of thrush, cavities, and whatever else wiped out from the iodine aside from covid.

I mean, it sounds like you're getting pretty horned up from imagining it, but you do you.

&gt;Did you stop because your teeth were nice and brown? Or was that not the reason?

Povidone-Iodine is literally sold over-the-counter under the Betadine brand name as a gargle. It has very specific instructions, which I followed. It's sold over the counter and considered safe. So I'm not sure where you're getting any of this from, but again it seems to be getting you all worked up so you do you.

&gt;I asked you to explain carrageenan because you are deeming yourself qualified in the topic enough to bring it up.

Literally all I said is there's some mild evidence to it and that people are using to make sprays of it as well. That's hardly me saying that I'm in any way qualified about anything.

The fact of the matter is that I wrote my comment in sheer frustration from the whole covid situation. Frustration for the toll the pandemic is taking on families. Not just those with dying loved ones but with those families who have members who will be feeling the effects of their illness for years to come. Frustration at the toll the pandemic is having on nurses and doctors and hospital workers. Frustration for those who have lost their job their home and their life. And foremost the frustration I have is that there are people being lied to. That there are forces out there that are actively working against the health of the nation. And I'm frustrated by those who perpetuate the hate and misinformation spewed by these media outlets. 

But I realized that people aren't t getting the vaccine because they are scared. Not scared of the vaccine in of itself but all these conspiracy theories coalesce into one thing. And then when they do get covid they are so scared that they turn to more conspiracies like invermectin. Who wouldn't want to do anything try anything to save their life. And this fear and desperation leads people to turn against the advice of doctors. People have lost their place in the world. They are disenfranchised by society and their place in it. Change has come about so quickly for them that they no longer understand their place in life so they fall prey to false prophets claiming conspiracies. Not realizing that maybe their president claiming hydroxycloroquinine was a cure because the government bought huge quantities of it without any studies about its efficacy And then I get frustrated by an education system that has failed them in their ability to think critically. They've been oppressed not by their governments but by an economy that requires them to fight and struggle just to survive. Oppressed not by a government but by unfeeling bosses and corporation who hold profit more sacrosanct than human life and well being. 

So I apologize. My comment was made out of frustration and fatigue. But when I see the hate and ignorance spewed by these people I forget their circumstances and lose my empathy for them. Bit your comment reminded me that while difficult this pandemic is maybe it's just as important to feel some empathy for these anti vaxxers. They've been lied too and in their desperation they've believed these lies. So thank you for the reminder to be a little kinder to people.

I haven't moved in yet, and I have health anxiety. This whole thing has me in knots. 

My question is, how safe is it for me if my roommate is going to parties and football games, considering we're both vaccinated? Our school also has a vaccine mandate, but you're allowed to get an exemption (but if you do so you have to be tested once or twice weekly). Do I need to worry? Or am I fine since we're both vaccinated?

I've been trying to do my own research on this, but I haven't been able to find a clear answer. What I'm really worried about are long-term effects from COVID; like, I get it and then I end up with lung scarring or something that permanently effects my health.

For example, my basic understanding of the COVID mRNA vaccines are that they cause your body to produce the spike protein COVID uses.  I'm assuming that a flu mRNA vaccine would try to find something common to all (or a large number) of flu strains that they can use as an antigen.  The idea being that you'd now have far better efficacy than a vaccine with a strain that may only be ""close"" to whatever strain you get.  So, ideally, you don't need to hamfist 100 different strains into the vaccine, but maybe the mRNA approach will allow you to produce 2 or 3 antigens that target most if not all strains of flu.

I'll be honest though that I don't know a whole lot about this subject or how they'll implement this for flu.

The more deaths during a time in which less than 50% of all people were vacced are included, the lower this number gets. Extreme example to show this effect: if 1% of the population is vaccinated and 1% of all covid-19 related deaths are vaccinated people, that means the vaccine doesn't help at all. (I wanna say right here that all real data we have is very clearly showing that the vaccine actually works really well, this is purely an example to showcase how statistics could trick us).

On the other hand, in the perfect world where we can reach 100% vaccination and nobody can't get vacced for medical reason, 100% of all covid-19 deaths will be vaccinated people.

Ratio of vaccinated deaths vs unvaccinated deaths can only be taken at face value if the vaccination rate is exactly 50%, otherwise more math is needed to figure out how well it actually works. I would assume with the timespan included in this statistic, the real number should be a tad higher.

That would give you a general idea of the antibodies you have, which doesn't exactly tell you how much protection you do or don't have, but many recent studies are showing a high correlation between antibodies/titers and how well the person does against covid.  

It's only initial data, but Pfizer's booster trials were showing that after about 8 months, you might have only 20% of the antibodies you started with after the peak from shot #2.  Moderna seems to fair a bit better (likely because they're using the bigger dose 100ug vs 30ug of mRNA), so you may not be quite as bad off but I'm assuming the same kind of drop off occurs.

&gt; The COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the United States continue to be highly effective in reducing risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death, even against the widely circulating Delta variant. However, COVID-19 constantly evolves. Experts are looking at all available data to understand how well the vaccines are working, including how new variants, like Delta, affect vaccine effectiveness. **If FDA authorizes and ACIP recommends it**, the goal is for people to start receiving a COVID-19 booster shot this fall.

On 4 August, the World Health Organization called for a moratorium on boosters until at least the end of September. “Wasting resources on boosters for those who are already protected against severe disease does not really make too much sense,” says Laith Jamal Abu-Raddad, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Weill Cornell Medicine—Qatar in Doha. “Down the line, probably, we would need to think of it.

The vaccine trials were the shortest in history. Thankfully alot of people who dont want the vaccine, wait for people like you to become the example of ""the experiment"". Meaning continuation of data collection from the general public on its side effects/benefits. My circle is batting 3/5.

My dad had a stroke on may 4th. Got his second moderna shot on april 28th.

My neighbor had a stroke after Astra Zeneca 2nd dose 7 days after. 

My brother in laws dad had AfiB non stop for 4 weeks straight after the 2nd Covid Vaccine shot.

My mom had no complications

My bro had no complications (he is always high and wouldn't know)

3 out of 5 in my close family have had vaccine cardiac complications. I took care of my dad during his stroke recovery. For those that have side effects from the vaccine permanently disabling them or killing them isnt fair for you to blame anti propaganda.  Its disrespectful to those that have lost their family from COVID vaccines or permanently injured. 

Truth of the matter is... its not propaganda. Alot of us are seeing the side effects first hand or lost loved ones.  See it from both sides, clearly you're too much of a vaccine follower to look at the whole picture or &lt;IQ.  Thankfully there is smart people who actually do review the totality of data.

Lastly, isreal has the highest vaccination rate and also the most deaths and infections currently in the world (Shaking my head)


Note: I endorse the vaccine, and also endorse peoples right to choose.
Both have risks, and both can have permanent fatal consequences.  Choose wisely... i tell my family if they get the booster let me know so i can check in with them daily up to 8 days after getting it, in case strokes occur as did with my father.

I met older lady whose husband got covid (confirmed). He died after few days, they gave her only his wedding ring and watches. One of the first confirmed covid death in my country. On the other hand my mother and sisters got it with only mild headache and light cough.

I love Dr. Fauci but he outright said the mask stance was a lie to save PPE for healthcare, which I get it is noble but don't lie to the public. 

Israel and real world data elsewhere is showing us the protection against catching covid wanes over time. The severity and outcomes are still not as bad as the unvaccinated but it's making headway in a bad direction. Remember in the Spring and early Summer it looked like this was becoming over and break through cases were rare? Now they're almost 1 in 5 or 1 in 4 of cases. What does that tell you? 

Maybe we got the time between doses wrong, maybe we got the amount of vaccine wrong in the grand scheme of things given the incredible turn around time of their development. But the fact remains, there are those in the population who are most vulnerable vaccinated or not if that's age or other health conditions. With the holidays coming up we may enter into an upswing again. The third shot definitely appears to provide a robust immune response and protect those who need it, so why not recommend it?

I personally am tired of being afraid to leave the house for the 'mY fRrEdOmS"" crowd and any net positive in that direction to keep me and my family safe is a step I want to take. 

The counter arguments in this story amount to ""reasons"". There's a slight chance of heart inflammation but as the below points out greatly reduces the odds of catching it and spreading it. This is a trade I and many others are happy to make. The second reason is moral hazard and ethical. I don't have a great response for this one because I see the argument in a perfect world. But the world isn't perfect, we shouldn't be stopped from being given the ability to protect ourselves further should we so choose. 

I have a young son who isn't old enough to be vaccinated and was born a few months prior to the pandemic. I have parents who are old and immunocompromised from cancer battles.

He wrote that he applied for a religious exemption to the requirement that wasn't granted.""After applying for a religious exemption and attempting to further negotiate alternative working arrangements, I was ultimately relieved of my duties here at Navy,"" Sutzmann wrote.

Head coach Ken Niumatalolo didn't address the specifics of Stutzmann's departure with reporters.“He’s added a lot to our program,” Niumatalolo said Monday, per the Associated Press. “Wish him the best of luck, he and his wife Shanelle. Wonderful young man.

Longtime offensive coordinator Irvin Jasper will remain with the team in a new capacity.  
Niumatalolo said that the initial decision to fire Jasper was made by athletic director Chet Gladchuk. The program decided to retain him in his secondary role as quarterbacks coach after further discussion.

In Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116 (1958), the United States Secretary of State had refused to issue a passport to an American citizen based on the suspicion that the plaintiff was going abroad to promote communism (personal restrictions/national security). Although the Court did not reach the question of constitutionality in this case, the Court, in an opinion by Justice William O. Douglas, held that the federal government may not restrict the right to travel without due process:

The right to travel is a part of the 'liberty' of which the citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment. If that ""liberty"" is to be regulated, it must be pursuant to the law-making functions of the Congress. . . . . Freedom of movement across frontiers in either direction, and inside frontiers as well, was a part of our heritage. Travel abroad, like travel within the country, . . . may be as close to the heart of the individual as the choice of what he eats, or wears, or reads.

&gt; We identified a subgroup of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (~5% of patients), who remained seronegative across a wide range of antigens, isotypes, and technologies. 

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33614814/

&gt; Of 132 patients included, 99 (75%) showed positive antibody titers after a median (Q1-Q3) of 11 (8-14) days. 

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32707511/

&gt; Overall positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2-IgG was 81.1 % in outpatients (irrespective of sampling before or after day 21 after onset of symptoms) but significantly lower in asymptomatic contact persons (15.4 %, p &lt; 0.0001). 

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34003792/

&gt; The seroconversion rates during the postinfection windows of 0 to 7 days, 10 to 28 days, and 6 to 10 weeks were 46%, 84.7%, and 85.3%, respectively (N = 743).

I’m asking why people often don’t care about kids whose parents do bad things. For instance people saying that they don’t feel bad about the kids of antivaxers or people not caring about kids of illegal immigrants or people making excuses for abusive parents. Obviously you’re not doing all that. But there is a common thread in those situations that I can’t parse out. Namely, why don’t people care about kids for their own sake even when they disagree with those kids’ parents? And one thing that I was wondering about is if people tend to see kids as an extension of their parents. My mother definitely saw me and my siblings as extensions of herself, and I’ve seen other people do that. And if people did see kids that way then I could understand how they came to that conclusion. I guess that this is analogous to the movement and countermovement that is expressed in the quote “she’s someone’s mother/daughter/sister/wife” as a justification for not harassing women and later someone crossing out most of that quote so that it just says “She’s someone” with everything else crossed out. And the point was that a few men valued women more when they thought of them as another man’s wife or girlfriend it family members then when they thought of them as just some woman, and other people thought that they should be valued for their own sake.

I'm a under 30 male who is in great shape and no medical issues or conditions. I'm very worried about the heart inflammation as two of my teammates had heart issues after their first dose of pfizer, one that had issues for the past three months and the other mild.

I've also had an allergic reaction to a vaccine in the past and went into anaphylaxis. The doctor could not find a record of it, but it had something to do with an egg protein(?) and put me in anaphylaxis. I'm very worried about this of this happening again and don't know which vax to get because of it. My mother also had GBS that nearly killed her whem I was younger so J&amp;J does worry me.
