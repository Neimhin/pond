The Care Home workforce in the UK has many lovely people.  Typically they are not well-educated, and a significant proportion are first-generation Eastern Europeans.  The majority are women.  It‚Äôs low paid.

Within the unvaccinated group you have:

A few absolute refuseniks, heavily influenced by social media, and not exposed to more reasonable points of view because they don‚Äôt read mainstream news sources

Eastern Europeans who as a community tend to believe that eating well and staying active will boost immunity more effectively than a vaccine, and who may not have good access to official or media sources of alternative points of view written in their own first language

Women hoping to conceive, pregnant or post partum - the vaccines were not initially recommended to those pregnant and while it‚Äôs now clear it‚Äôs riskier to get Covid in pregnancy than have the vaccine, it‚Äôs taking a while for that message to catch up and many women remain conflicted about the decision

And a very significant number who caught Covid in a care home before the vaccine programme started, who are concerned about having the vaccine as the side effects are more unpleasant - and likely to result in time off work - if you already have antibodies.

I absolutely believe everyone should have the vaccine and the booster now being rolled out, apart from a tiny number of people for whom any vaccine would be contraindicated.

But I can see why 90 to 95% uptake is the norm for care workers, even after compulsory vaccination came in.

And I was like my body is way ahead of Covid in this case. 

I'll just leave with what my endo told me when I asked them if I should take any special precautions - ""Nah, you're good.

West it the part where I disgustingly say we need to get daily new cases under 5/100k that led you to this belief?

&gt; b). Your comment assumes that unvaccinated are following mask mandates.

I do not assume this, that they are wearing them 100% correctly, or that they are doing so in private. What I am assuming is _most_ will still follow the mandate, wearing them and even less than perfectly still has some positive effect on reducing transmission and severity. It is about _mitigation_.

&gt; **Results**

&gt; We observe a statistically significant positive association between COVID-19 mortality and the proportion of the overweight in adult populations spanning 154 countries. This association holds across countries belonging to different income groups and is not sensitive to a population's median age, proportion of the elderly, and/or proportion of females. 

&gt; The estimated elasticities of COVID-19 mortality, with respect to the proportion of the overweight in adult populations, are consistently higher for sub-samples of countries that belong to a higher income group. 

&gt; On an average, every percentage point increment in the proportion of the overweight in adult populations contributes to an additional 3.5% points to COVID-19 mortality for high income countries: the limits of confidence intervals around this point estimate range between 1.5 and 5.4.

&gt; **Conclusions**

&gt; A positive association between COVID-19 mortality and the proportion of the overweight in a country's adult population is robust, subject to alterations in the conditioning information set on age, gender, and income.

2) The mainstream media are not angels. A lot of them pedelled on stories about the dangers of vaccines. Mainstream media has been no where near ""reasonable points of view"" during the pandemic.

&gt; But I can see why 90 to 95% uptake is the norm for care workers,

That's not even right. The article itself states the figure is 86%.

In my state when we lifted the mask requirements our 7-day death average was 6. It's now 14, despite not having a statewide mask mandate because vaccines do exactly what they are supposed to do. 

So you throwing around your own numbers as to what *you think* would be reasonable, is frankly worthless. Thus, your dismissiveness and talking down to people who question your flawed statements is neither helpful nor appropriate.

Importance: To date, the association of psychiatric diagnoses with mortality in patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has not been evaluated.

Objective: To assess whether a diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, mood disorder, or anxiety disorder is associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19.

Design, setting, and participants: This retrospective cohort study assessed 7348 consecutive adult patients for 45 days following laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between March 3 and May 31, 2020, in a large academic medical system in New York. The final date of follow-up was July 15, 2020. Patients without available medical records before testing were excluded.

Exposures: Patients were categorized based on the following International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnoses before their testing date: (1) schizophrenia spectrum disorders, (2) mood disorders, and (3) anxiety disorders. Patients with these diagnoses were compared with a reference group without psychiatric disorders.

Main outcomes and measures: Mortality, defined as death or discharge to hospice within 45 days following a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test result.

Results: Of the 26 540 patients tested, 7348 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 54 [18.6] years; 3891 [53.0%] women). Of eligible patients with positive test results, 75 patients (1.0%) had a history of a schizophrenia spectrum illness, 564 (7.7%) had a history of a mood disorder, and 360 (4.9%) had a history of an anxiety disorder. After adjusting for demographic and medical risk factors, a premorbid diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder was significantly associated with mortality (odds ratio [OR], 2.67; 95% CI, 1.48-4.80). Diagnoses of mood disorders (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.87-1.49) and anxiety disorders (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.65-1.41) were not associated with mortality after adjustment. In comparison with other risk factors, a diagnosis of schizophrenia ranked behind only age in strength of an association with mortality.

Conclusions and relevance: In this cohort study of adults with SARS-CoV-2-positive test results in a large New York medical system, adults with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder diagnosis were associated with an increased risk for mortality, but those with mood and anxiety disorders were not associated with a risk of mortality. These results suggest that schizophrenia spectrum disorders may be a risk factor for mortality in patients with COVID-19.",,,,1633286874,{},hf99sw7,True,t3_q0nzdd,False,False,t3_q0nzdd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q0nzdd/association_of_psychiatric_disorders_with/hf99sw7/,1633415554.0,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the nearly 2 years it's been around, look at how much we've learned about how the coronavirus family of contagions work. Look how much money and time and effort is being thrown at it. Look at how many companies are working on vaccines, cures, remedies, etc.

Will we have to wear masks for the rest of our lives? Not for COVID. Will we have to continue to wear masks until the medical community figures out a way to make it no more serious than the annual flu? Probably a good idea. I was reading the other day that Merck has a new antiviral they're working on that supposedly cuts the risk of hospitalization and death. It will probably take another 2-4 years for us to truly get to the point that we don't worry about it more than influenza. And honestly, the longer people keep pushing back against something so simple, the longer this will go on.

Think of it like the flu and Tamiflu. First, there was a push for a few years to get everyone to get their annual flu shot, consider staying home if you were sick, and general sanitary practices. Then Tamiflu came along so now people can get that and stand a better chance of not being laid up for 2-3 weeks. With COVID and the increased sanitary practices, last seasons influenza totals were the lowest in recorded history. In theory, we'll be like that with COVID at some point in the future but that takes time for the researchers to figure out what works and what doesn't, for studies to be done proving those points and the safety in humans, to come up with proper dosing, to do larger trials, to submit for FDA approval, and to have the requisite amount of follow up for full approval.

Your point contradicts the plain language of this review article published in CDC's journal.  

&gt; The general public can use cloth masks to protect against  infection  spread  in  the  community.  In  community settings, masks may be used in 2 ways. First, they may be used by sick persons to prevent spread of infection (source control), and most health organizations (including WHO and CDC) recommend such use.

However, this paper is from October 2020 when N95s were incredibly difficult to source and what you could source was likely to be counterfeit.  The facts on the ground have changed.  You can order 3M 9502 masks straight from their website in boxes of 50 for $60 with shipping.

They maye have some difference in timings, but it is by a few weeks and usually ON and QC have been on the leading edge.  

The latest wave has been driven by Delta, with BC, QC and AB all finding their first cases within the first 3 weeks of April. If you look back over the summer, most provinces actually started rising all at the same time (late June to mid July)as Delta took off. AB and SK however continue to blow all other provinces out of the water. Their rate of covid infection is between 500-600 cases per 100k. That's 5-10x ON and QC, and QC and ON are currently trending downwards in cases, while there is no such indication for AB.

Seriously, are you maintaining that the current state of affairs in AB/SK is somehow decoupled from the two most impactful, scientifically backed COVID interventions of vaccinations and social distancing?

Fauci, an adviser on the pandemic to President Biden, emphasized the need for the 70 million Americans who are eligible for a vaccine to get immunized during interviews on Sunday morning talk shows.

&gt;‚ÄùMany of those deaths were unavoidable but many, many are avoidable, were avoidable and will in the future be avoidable,‚Äù Dr. Fauci, who is also director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN‚Äôs State the Union.

&gt;Dr. Fauci was enthusiastic about the development of the new Merck anti-viral pill, describing it as ‚Äúextremely important.‚Äù In announcing the results of its clinical trial last Friday, Merck said the pill was able to cut the risk of hospitalization and death from the virus by half.

&gt;But he also warned that Americans should not wait to be vaccinated because they believe they can take the pill. While the new medicine may decrease a person‚Äôs risk, the best way to be protected is avoiding infection, he said.

&gt;Merck said it would seek emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for its drug, known as molnupiravir, as soon as possible. The pills could be available by late this year.

&gt;Dr. Fauci pointed to the stark difference in how many people died during Merck‚Äôs clinical trial for the treatment, with eight among the placebo group and none among those taking the drug. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs very impressive, so we really look forward to the implementation of this and to its effect on people who are infected,‚Äù he said.

&gt;The federal government has placed advanced orders for 1.7 million doses of the new medication. But Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former F.D.A. commissioner under President Trump and a board member for Pfizer, said that amount was ‚Äúnot enough‚Äù on CBS‚Äô Face the Nation, covering only one month‚Äôs worth of infections in Southern states since the Delta variant emerged. He also contrasted that quantity with the national stockpile of medication to treat a flu pandemic, which he said numbers in the tens of millions.

&gt;Earlier, Dr. Fauci dismissed the notion that federal officials had not procured enough of the medicine, saying they had placed ‚Äúa good bet‚Äù on the treatment.

&gt;‚ÄùWe have options for millions more,‚Äù he said on the program, predicting the company would ramp up production to meet demand in the United States and across the world.

&gt;Dr. Fauci also expressed optimism that the country was now seeing a slow down in cases, signaling a potential respite from the pandemic. ‚ÄúWe certainly are turning a corner on this particular surge,‚Äù he said during an interview on ‚ÄúThis Week‚Äù on ABC News.

&gt;But he also refused to predict whether people would be able to freely gather this coming Christmas, saying on CBS News that ‚Äúit‚Äôs just too soon to tell.‚Äù",,,,1633281845,{},hf8xali,True,t3_q0mat2,False,False,t3_q0mat2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q0mat2/fauci_says_americans_should_get_vaccinated_even/hf8xali/,1633409370.0,13,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;Even though parts of New England are seeing record case counts, hospitalizations and deaths that rival pre-vaccine peaks, largely among the unvaccinated, the region hasn‚Äôt seen the impact the delta variant wave has wrought on other parts of the country.

&gt;According to statistics from The Associated Press, the five states with the highest percentage of a fully vaccinated population are all in New England, with Vermont leading, followed by Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. New Hampshire is 10th.

&gt;According to the AP data, full vaccination rates across the six New England states range from a high of 69.4% in Vermont to 61.5% in New Hampshire.

&gt;Despite the relatively high vaccination rates ‚Äî the U.S. as a whole is averaging 55.5% ‚Äî there are still hundreds of thousands of people across the region who, for one reason or another, remain unvaccinated and vulnerable to infection.

&gt;Now, a Rhode Island official said he didn‚Äôt think the 70% vaccination goal, once touted as the level that would help end the pandemic in the state, is enough.

&gt;‚ÄùWhat we‚Äôve learned with delta and looking beyond delta, is because that‚Äôs where our focus is as well, to really reach those levels of vaccination, to give you that true population level protection, you need to be in excess of 90%,‚Äù said Tom McCarthy, the executive director of the Rhode Island Department of Health",,,,1633281452,{},hf8wcaw,True,t3_q0m5us,False,True,t3_q0m5us,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q0m5us/virus_surge_hits_new_england_despite_high/hf8wcaw/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,1bc980f573288234e1b9f28a88c008ba8ef24deb,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1633281470.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

&gt;The rollout of Covid vaccines for healthy 12 to 15-year-olds in England started on 20 September, but the process is more complicated than for some age groups because the shots are given through schools and parental consent is needed beforehand.

&gt;Dr Helen Salisbury, a GP in Oxford and a member of the Independent Sage committee, said while it made sense to deliver Covid vaccinations through schools, the programme was starting late compared with other countries and that many schools could struggle given recent cuts to school nursing and medical services.

&gt;She said the combination of ‚Äúhalf-hearted endorsement‚Äù of the vaccine in the age group and ‚Äústretched services‚Äù risked further delaying vaccinations in teenagers. Sending children back to school without masks, extra ventilation, bubbles and isolation policies was ‚Äúa total recipe for ensuring everybody gets exposed‚Äù, she added.

&gt;‚ÄùI don‚Äôt understand why we are not getting on with it. It seems urgent. Urgent to protect these children, and to protect their families, and to protect their education,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe should have started this in the summer.‚Äù

&gt;Jorja Halliday, a 15-year-old from Portsmouth, died from Covid last week on the day she was due to have her Covid jab. She developed myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart, days after contracting the virus. While some cases of heart inflammation have been recorded as an extremely rare side-effect of the vaccine, none have led to deaths in young people. The risk of myocarditis appears to be substantially higher from Covid than the vaccine.

Maybe ... maybe not ... we need to do a cost/benefit analysis. It is really hard to do that, when the situation is constantly changing. There's many measures we individually can take. There's many measures companies, institutions and governments can. Each of those have a cost and an estimated benefit.

If by 'not worth the benefit' you mean we should just all stop all the extra efforts we're doing to stop COVID and go back to exactly the same behaviors as in 2019, I'd say that's a very dumb idea. If you mean that, \*after\* we manage to bring COVID so it's not a public health issue any more (right now, it is, in the USA), and we have only a few thousand cases, or a few hundred deaths a year, we can stop many of the measures (other than vaccination, and some vaccination mandates), then that's a much more reasonable position. We can talk about it when we get COVID down (maybe y'all can talk about it now in Vermont, or in Portugal, or in Sweden, not sure where you are). 

At an individual level, I'm vaccinated, as is my family (luckily, we all can). I avoid large indoor gatherings, and wear a mask when in a public indoor space. If we all did that, COVID will be a non-issue, but I can't control other people's behavior (at least not much :).

Many companies are developing vaccines and treatments. Woohoo! Great for them, thanks. 

Many government organizations are doing many things; I support the efforts and many of the measures. I want the FDA to approve vaccines for younger people (after they are safe). I want more private and government incentives and mandates for COVID vaccination, where legal and appropriate. I would like many of these to stay over the coming years.

And we \*can\* worry/act about COVID, opioids and obesity at the same time. I walk outdoors :). I've (almost?) never used opioids, or have close contact with an addict (as far as I know), but in 2020 we had about 10 times as many COVID deaths as drug overdose deaths.",,,,1633221134,{},hf5yc7k,False,t3_pzq8v8,False,True,t1_hf5hcxa,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pzq8v8/daily_discussion_thread_october_02_2021/hf5yc7k/,1633351902.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seriously though, you‚Äôre right that certain disorders are over represented among the anti vax/mask crowd, and I‚Äôd add something another commenter in another thread mentioned that I think got to the core of the misinfo problem: 

There‚Äôs two different ways to classify info: where we read/saw it, or who we heard it from. I‚Äôm not talking about the site (Reddit, Facebook), but the source (CNN article, or Tina‚Äôs cousin‚Äôs friend who is a nurse or ‚Äúsomeone in the comments‚Äù). Older generations tend to trust info from their social network (on Facebook), while younger generations tend to trust their preferred sources (that‚Äôs not to say these sources are any good, just it‚Äôs a different way of classifying sources). 

The problem is that disinformation exploits this, feeding it from foreign and Koch-funded troll farms to useful idiots with what‚Äôs perceived as credibility to their social network, then it spreads like wildfire being blindly trusted, while far off institutions are distrusted.  

I‚Äôve also observed this in two large walking groups I‚Äôm a part of; I‚Äôm in my early 40s, and in one group I‚Äôm barely the oldest, in the other I‚Äôm barely the youngest. Covid and the pandemic come up in conversations (that I‚Äôm a part of and those I overhear), and I‚Äôve noticed each of the age groups references sources for what they‚Äôre saying very differently, with the older set usually citing people they know, and the younger set citing the info source itself. Additionally, the scientific literacy of the older group is mixed while it seems to be better in the younger group. This all adds up to some in the older group being taken in by the misinfo. 

There‚Äôs younger people falling for this too, especially in rural areas, but that goes back to the ‚Äútrusted person‚Äù rather than ‚Äútrusted source‚Äù way of thinking. 

It remains to be seen whether the ‚Äútrusted person‚Äù thinkers can be shifted away from that and to verifying info for themselves (several types of literacy needed for that‚Ä¶), or if the best approach might be to fight fire with fire and use their weakness to feed them info and misinfo that creates the wanted behaviors.",,,,1633283939,{},hf92ksk,False,t3_q0f2da,False,False,t1_hf8c3hz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q0f2da/every_one_of_those_deaths_is_unnecessary_expert/hf92ksk/,1633412001.0,27,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the time and freedom we bought now, we can invest it in getting treatments that are targeted at Covid and which would allow us to reduce it to just a bad cold in most cases.

My guess for the future is that vaccines plus treatment will get it down to a manageable infection/hospitalization rate and reduce the number of people who have sever effects to a minimum.

Where are you getting $20?

&gt; These vaccines are free to all patients, thanks to funding by the U.S. government which negotiated contracts with the Covid-19 vaccine makers that will supply enough vaccines to cover our entire population.

&gt; Of course, these contracts came at a cost to the government, from $39 for Pfizer‚Äôs two dose regimen, $32 for Moderna‚Äôs regimen, and $10 for J&amp;J‚Äôs single shot. For perspective, the price of one‚Äôs annual quadrivalent flu shot ranges from $35 - $41, with the more potent shot being almost twice as high.

&gt; Amount Facility Charged || Medicare Approved Amount || Amount Medicare Paid

&gt; 1st Dose (Pfizer) $144.00 $144.00 $18.79

But there was also someone from one of the state‚Äôs isolated rural communities who needed to be flown in for emergency surgery.

&gt;Who should get the final bed?

&gt;Dr. ‚Äã‚ÄãSteven Floerchinger gathered with his colleagues for an agonizing discussion. They had a better chance of saving one of the patients in the emergency room, they determined. The other person would have to wait.

&gt;That patient died.

Molnupiravir, a wide-spectrum antiviral that is currently in phase 2/3 clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19, is proposed to inhibit viral replication by a mechanism known as ‚Äòlethal mutagenesis‚Äô. Two recently published studies reveal the biochemical and structural bases of how molnupiravir disrupts the fidelity of SARS-CoV-2 genome replication and prevents viral propagation by fostering error accumulation in a process referred to as ‚Äòerror catastrophe‚Äô.

&amp;#x200B;

Concluding Paragraph:

In summary, the two studies demonstrate that molnupiravir-induced lethal mutagenesis is minimally a two-step mechanism characterized by a relatively high selectivity of MTP for incorporation as a CTP analog and the indiscriminate incorporation of either ATP (mutagenesis) or GTP when MNP is localized in the templating strand. The erroneously incorporated AMP can subsequently template UTP incorporation, generating downstream C-to-U mutations. The accumulation of mutations pushes viral replication over the ‚Äòerror threshold‚Äô that demarcates the replication fidelity required for viability. This mechanism distinguishes molnupiravir from remdesivir, which impedes the progression of viral RdRp, and provides insights into alternative mechanisms of RdRp inhibition. Finally, molnupiravir possesses excellent pharmacokinetic properties14, which include oral administration. An orally bioavailable antiviral will have far-reaching benefits in tackling the spread of COVID-19 in hard-to-reach communities worldwide. As with all therapeutic agents, off-target effects are a concern. In its triphosphate form, molnupirivar is a substrate for the mitochondrial RNA polymerase, which can also incorporate MTP as a U or C analog. Reassuringly, the same study noted that mitochondrial function over 14 days was not significantly inhibited15, and Sheahan et al. did not observe mutagenesis of host mRNA8. However, it has been suggested that exposure to molnupiravir can be mutagenic to host DNA during host DNA replication16. Therefore, the potential off-target effects will require further investigation.",,,,1633290099,{},hf9hx11,True,t3_q0p2e1,False,False,t3_q0p2e1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q0p2e1/molnupiravir_coding_for_catastrophe_nature/hf9hx11/,1633419373.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,
