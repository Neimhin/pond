[],,EvanWithTheFactCheck,,,,,,[],"Because that historical program has historically low rates of approving claims and doling out payouts.

As of last month, Fauci reported that only 60% of CDC employees and similarly only 60% of FDA employees were vaccinated.  Not sure what the rate is now, a month later, but those rates correlate to my own state, which was about 60% then and 72% now for all eligible residents.

Considering only about 1-3% of the population has a legitimate medical reason to refuse the vaccine, we we have to consider that we still have a sizable population of the general public who are hesitant for one reason or another.  And since that appears to track with FDA employees and CDC employees, we must consider the possibility that the hesitant may have legitimate reasons to hold off on taking the risk ‚Äî at least for now.  To assume everyone who is hesitant is simply an uneducated redneck plague rat who is ill informed is to assume the same of FDA and CDC employees, which I find to be an unreasonable assumption, though I admit perhaps the argument could be made by others. 

If we want to diminish hesitancy and raise vaccination rates, we must humor the notion that even in circles like the CDC and FDA, there is a sizable proportion of people who for one reason or another aren‚Äôt quite ready to take that risk for themselves, and try to honestly empathize and understand where their hesitation resides and how we as a society can come together to help mitigate their risk and assuage their concerns.

As I mentioned, I work in healthcare, so I know a ton of frontline healthcare workers.  In my own small office, 4 out of 5 of my coworkers have already gotten covid last year and recovered.  The moderna vaccine was made available to us in January, and that is when I took my shots.  3 of the 4 of of my coworkers who have recovered from covid took the vaccine after I did.  The 1 who was never confirmed to have covid took it as well.  We have the 1 holdout in my office who has still not been jabbed and her reasoning is that she already has natural immunity, so the vaccine wouldn‚Äôt offer enough benefit to her to take the risk of suffering a potential vaccine side effect.  She always comes back to this same question: if she gets seriously ill or dies from the vaccine, who will cover her medical bills?  As a single mom, if she dies from a vaccine side effect, who will care for her child?   She has already looked up the the potential insurance coverage and the history of government payouts and the low rate of payout is not encouraging enough to inspire her to take the risk of getting a vaccine for a virus she already has natural immunity protection from.

For my coworker, the threat of denying her health coverage for covid hospitalization rings hollow because she has natural immunity (confirmed by antibody test results?  It‚Äôs simply a non-issue to her and will do nothing to move the needle for her.  What MIGHT move the needle for her to bear the risk of vaccination is the unwavering assurance that if she is hospitalized for a vaccine side effect, someone will cover her hospital bills.  If no one is willing to grant her this assurance, she sees no reason to take on the risk and liability on her own.

Bear in mind we have seen two instances our own patients who have experienced severe side effects from taking the vaccine.  Not a high percentage, but it is something we have seen literally with our own eyes.  One of the two literally almost died and had to be revived by his wife who followed instructions on the phone to preform life saving procedures on him while waiting for the ambulance to arrive.  This couple was always and continues even now to take a pro-vaccine position for the general public, but the husband has decided (with his wife‚Äôs urging) to skip the second shot.  

You can‚Äôt tell me that my coworker‚Äôs fear is unfounded having witnessed this (admittedly rare) risk of vaccination being played out in front her own eyes, knowing full well as a health care worker that he is ineligible for insurance coverage and must now navigate the labyrinthal halls of government bureaucracy to seek compensation for his vaccine injuries which is not exactly guaranteed at this point in time.  Especially after experiencing covid herself and knowing how mild it was for her personally, as well as witnessing the majority of her coworkers as well as some of our patients recover from covid with mild symptoms (we haven‚Äôt personally seen any of our patients die or suffer severe effects, all of us experienced cold/flu like symptoms.  I myself only lost my sense of smell and taste for about 45 days).  Telling her she won‚Äôt be eligible for covid-related health insurance coverage won‚Äôt convince her to get vaccinated.  But offering protection and support for the potential risks of vaccination might.

That‚Äôs my own anecdote, but I‚Äôm sure there are many like my coworkers who has already recovered from covid and see little of serious reinfection and won‚Äôt be moved to vaccinate on the basis of denying her future covid related health coverage.  It could explain why there is such a high rate of vaccine hesitancy in health care workers and first responders, who probably have a higher rate of previous infection and natural immunity than non health care workers who worked from home all year and had lower levels of exposure and infection.  It might explain why even people working for the FDA and CDC are tracking with general trends of vaccination prevalence and hesitancy.  You have to accept that some people who have first hand knowledge of covid see it as a lower personal risk than the potential risk of getting vaccinated, and that the way to get them to take the shot is to mitigate the potential risk of vaccination to be equal or lower than the risk of catching covid (again).

Honestly, what is the harm in running a campaign to widely publicize that people don‚Äôt have to worry so much about even the rarer side effects, at least not the monetary aspect of it, because we have them covered and this coverage is a priority that is unequivocal, streamlined, and guaranteed?  I don‚Äôt see why anyone would oppose this tack.

There are other ways to encourage vaccine  uptake in the hesitant than shaming, coercing, punishing, and demeaning.  We can also offer support and protection guarantees.  Let‚Äôs show the hesitant that we care about them and we understand their concerns and are willing and able to protect them if they vaccinate to protect others.  Always and only taking a purely negative and punishing tack will only breed distrust, hate, and societal level resentment.  My coworker is will not be convinced by the punishing tactic of removing covid protections for the unvaccinated, but such a policy could lead her to think policy makers are only hyper focused on vaccination rates and don‚Äôt value the lives of anyone who is unvaccinated at all.  And it may lead her to distrust hyper focused vaccination campaigns and not get vaxxed at all.",,,1624241446,{},h2hsa3q,False,t3_o4d1bu,False,True,t1_h2hmtrw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o4d1bu/two_americas_may_emerge_as_delta_variant_spreads/h2hsa3q/,1624549828,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_1420qr,False,False,,

They have no quality of life. Still, families will trach and PEG them and send them to a long term acute care facility for them to become septic and later die. It kills us to carry out these families' wishes, knowing that it's not what's best for the patient.

This is why it is absolutely ESSENTIAL for everyone to have frank conversations about how far they would want their care to go if they suffer a significant change in medical status.

Some insurance companies are better than others, and some are absolutely terrible.  I‚Äôve sat on the phone on hold for literally hours with certain insurance companies (ahem, MetLife) trying to process claims we both know they need to pay out, and I definitely see the possibility of some people simply giving up in frustrating and hanging up simply because they don‚Äôt have the time or energy or patience to chase compensation.

In that case, the public as well as our political leaders should demand a solution to this.  Either streamline the process like they did to require insurance companies cover covid testing and vaccine intake, or the government should step in to circumvent insurance companies to fund the hospital bills for people injured by vaccines.

It makes no sense to me why our government is able to make it so that we can easily and freely cover people to get tested for covid as frequently as we desire, we can freely and easily cover people getting vaccinated, but for some reason, vaccine related injuries are not covered and difficult to seek compensation for.

However, it's creative applications &amp; creative questions that yield exciting answers.

The jargon is just how we communicate - the real gold is in your own creativity, putting together interesting ideas to create something new!

My thoughts on mABs: Antibodies are specific to a single target by nature, and I think that's the issue in COVID. I'll take IL-6 antibodies (tocilizumab et. al.) as an example. IL-6 is one of many cytokines that influence inflammation across the body. Toci just targets that one cytokine, ignoring everything else (other interleukins, TNFa, etc.). Imagine a dam breaks, and all you do is use flex tape to patch up one of 30 holes. It's just not enough, and that's what the data shows as well; there's no statistical significance until you get to thousands of patients, and then it's a 1-2% benefit.

I'm doing my PhD in tissue engineering &amp; regenerative medicine at Stanford, but I've published in undergrad &amp; before in multiple fields including drug delivery, inflammation &amp; neonatology, cancer biology, biomaterials, gut bioengineering, and astrochemistry. Part of the reason I publish often &amp; across disciplines is because a lot of my hobbies are just science side projects that end up turning into cool papers LOL. For example, the astrochemistry paper &amp; one of my cancer papers were both side projects &amp; have come out really well! Other than that in my free time, I work in biotech venture &amp; consult with biopharma startups. Recently I've gotten very interested in math though - a lot of my best ideas come from other fields, but I realized that I know very little about the open problems &amp; concepts in math so I've been learning about that to see if I can repurpose ideas.

I had covid in January... pretty mild case. Went from a slight cough and a sense of unease to a 102 degree fever over the course of a day. The fever was bad (kind of knocked me out for twelve hours), but it dropped quickly. Afterwards my main symptom was six weeks of exhaustion, plus a couple days of coughing up alarming pink stuff. But covid *did* also affect my senses of smell and taste. Eventually they came back, and nothing seems particularly weird or muted now, but to be honest I don't know if I'll ever know for certain if they are at the level that they were before I got sick. I can't remember if it was different back then.

With the exception of my stint of feverish drifting in and out of consciousness during that first day, it didn't seem to affect my head at all... at least I don't think? I never got brain fog, but the anosmia isn't a good sign for the brain, is it? And now that I'm thinking about it I may or may not have developed slight tinnitus? I definitely have it a little bit now, wouldn't be surprised if I had it previously but honestly I'm not sure.

I think one of my big fears is uh. reduced mental acuity? Not sure whether it would be more scary to be aware that you're losing your sharpness while it's happening (a la Flowers for Algernon), or to lose yourself and NOT be aware of it. I'm kind of terrified that covid may have done the latter thing to me, knocking me down a few pegs without my knowledge.

The other thing is that a smoker is not a risk to others. Someone with covid is. They literally are contagious and can infect other people and are a danger to those around them. So treating a smoker or car accident patient does not put medical staff in danger but someone with covid entering a medical facility absolutely DOES. Even vaccinated people can get breakthrough infections of covid and not to mention those that are immunocompromised (ie. other hospital patients).

Increased resistance has been documented  with 10+ studies on AB fold reduction between variants, as well as phase 3 trial data that broke down vaccines impact on variants (Novavax for example, or the smaller south African study on AZ against B.1.3.51 which indicated dramatically lower protection against symptomatic than ancestral lineage) this the basis behind why R&amp;D into booster targeting epitopes on newer variants is being conducted (e.g by Moderna) despite all indication that the average  neutralization titre induction is good enough. Same principle behind considering giving an additional shot of the same vaccine to select groups. 

 with delta variant we see a small reduction in overall efficacy (as was consistent with reduction in alpha prior vs D614G) but an especially larger reduction in efficacy of one dose.  Of course we know that no vaccine for covid on market today is 100% effective and none are 'beaten' by variants, that is absolutely true, but it is not false to suggest that some variants are more vaccine resistant than others. 

The reduction in efficacy seen with delta vs alpha for example, is still stark enough to dramatically alter the percentage of population that needs to be covered for vaccine mediated herd immunity should that variant become dominant- this is before even factoring in higher transmissibility",,,1624246847,{},h2i21gj,False,t3_o4dbdl,False,False,t1_h2hihcv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o4dbdl/covid19_may_cause_loss_of_brain_tissue_delta/h2i21gj/,1624555608,18,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_1apco6a1,False,False,,

On the other hand, if the immune system isn't reacting to the vaccine, it's not creating those antibodies, and thus not giving any immunity.  
In my friend's case, going off the immunosuppressants for a while allows his immune system to become more sensitive, which allows the vaccine to take effect.  And, once the immune system is creating those antibodies, it won't stop making/being aware of them even when it's being suppressed again, maintaining immunity (or so I've heard).

I thought I would be excited to finally be on a vaccine list to get my shot and breathe a sigh of relief. But I'm beginning to wonder if I should wait for something better. 

From what I've gathered the Sinovac vaccine uses a dead form of the virus instead of mRNA. The Sinovac will boost immunity but appears to be not quite as effective as an mRNA vaccine, perhaps 60% as effective. 

Ya know what, I'd be cool with that for now if I knew that I could get a booster shot at some point down the road. My Google searches have yielded little. So perhaps someone could fill me in on what futures are possible for me once I've take the Sinovac vaccine. 

I've read that studies are underway in the Phillipines with mixing and matching Sinovac vaccines with ""name brand"" ones (Pfizer, Moderna, AZ). ""Studies underway"" is not the hope I'm looking for.

The Spanish Flu did, in fact, go extinct. Like the Black Death, the specific strains that were active during the height of the pandemic died out, leaving behind their less-deadly and less-virulent progeny.

&gt; &gt;Yes, it's too pedantic. It's pretty widely understood that a vaccine would need to fail more times than it succeeds for a variant to actually be considered ""vaccine resistant"".

with respect, that's not really accurate.
 Not in scientific circles (I'm a virologist) and while terms are more easily conflated amongst general public, not totally true either that this is generally accepted definition amongst all.

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant.html

&gt; Some variations allow the virus to spread more easily **or make it resistant to treatments or vaccines** Those variants must be monitored more carefully.

  Similar to how 'water resistant' is different to 'waterproof' or 'drop resistant' is different to drop proof etc,  resistant to arrest is different to avoids arrest -- overall suggesting vaccine resistance is very different to suggesting something can evade or bypass vaccines entirely and doesn't imply vaccines are ineffective. Also given as an example in my prior message was an example of when a covid vaccine had failed more times than not against a specific variant-- see the huge disparity between AZ measured effects on b1351 infection vs D614G (from &gt;80% to &lt;30%) - so even by your 'widely understood' definition given above that would qualify as ""vaccine resistant"".  

https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/india-covid-19-variant-exhibits-resistance-antibody-drug-shows-promise-2021-05-28/

Was not the goal to critique your comment just for the sake of it-  I know it can be annoying when someone nitpicks a comment that's overarchingly true and I do get exactly what you were getting at. I agree,  just think it's important to be clear with the messaging &amp; definitions- as on the one side you can have groups going too far with the fear mongering, on the other side we can get to the point of what some might see as obfuscation or denial of science for sake of positivity. Both can be problematic 

It is certainly true that there are variants (not strains as you and other OP had mentioned-- technically there are no such covid-19 strains but didn't want to be that pedantic!) that are more resistant to vaccines than others-  by quite a large degree--  (most commonly this refers to neutralization titre and not necessarily observable effect on efficacy, although the two tend to go hand in hand) but what you had stated is also true that none thus far can totally evade vaccines and this is likely to remain true, at least for foreseeable

What gives me hope is the success of the mRNA vaccines‚Äîas they can easily and quickly be adapted/changed to be more effective towards new variants. Once the virus mutates to a point where the current vaccine formulation is no longer effective, we can expect a booster dose matched to the variant to be available. My expectation is that this will probably be needed sooner or later. Vaccine uptake on the boosters would likely be less than the original shots (probably similar to that of the yearly flu shot uptake), but that‚Äôs okay because even the people who don‚Äôt take the booster would have residual immunity from their original shot (or from a subsequent infection, which of course would be milder than if they were not vaccinated).

If I look at statistics here, the vaccine is a little more concerning than the virus. I say that as a pro-vaccinator, who abides by all covid restrictions and takes it seriously. If I lived somewhere else things would be different but I don't.

In my state we have a population of around 1.75m. Since the beginning of covid we've had 788 total cases, with 601 of those being acquired overseas, and staying in hotel quarantine until they are negative. We've had 4 total deaths. So a 0.01% chance of catching covid locally, and a smaller chance of dying from it. These stats are from over a year of covid.

On the other hand, this man's blood clotting case was reported as ""not unexpected"". Our health minister tells us she expects that 1 in every 100,000 will develop this side effect. And yet when the first person did, after 150,000 doses had been given out, he wasn't taken seriously. He was sent home and not tested until it was too late and he died. They've given out only 150k doses, a man has died already. This is from a very short time frame already.

Yes the numbers are low, but they are there and when you've seen a person near you suffer like this, it feels more real. Then the government decides that instead of over 50s getting AZ, it will now be over 60s. Those over 60 (my parents included) joke that they're the expendable Australians not worth giving the good vaccines, they've gotta take the crappy one and hope that if they're the 1 in 100k, they're listened to and don't end up like this man.

As I said in another comment, I understand the logic and the facts. But when it becomes personal and close, it does get into your head. It makes you think Hey, I wish the government had said ""yes"" when offered a large amount of a vaccine that is widely considered safe, rather than putting all their eggs in the basket of one that could kill my parents.",,,1624309950,{},h2kxn8p,False,t3_o4jxga,False,True,t1_h2jj8yj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o4jxga/australians_who_skip_second_astrazeneca_vaccine/h2kxn8p/,1624614456,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_12y028,False,False,,

[],,PeonSanders,,,,,,[],"The US has all sorts of factors priming against vaccines, decades of horrible education, horrible news discourse, poor science education, a two party political system that is more and more polarized.

Above all though, I see the issue as religion. America is an exceedingly religious state, remarkably so for the developed world, and it's always had a radical history of a certain type of religious revivalism.  But, regions like the Northeast, look like more practicing versions of other developed nations. Religion is important to people, but it exists within a secularized context, and world view. 

In those regions, christianity is declining as it is in most places in the developed western world, less so among black and hispanic democrats.

I know two latinas who didn't get their shot, and in every discussion of the vaccine, or coronavirus, they express that things will get better by the grace of god. It's not a turn of phrase. It's indicative. It's inshallah. It's a world view with god at the center of it. It's a providential world view that says that the fate of man is held in the palm of an interceding god, who smites and gives succor from the plague.

In the deep south, in places where religion is at the center of public life, uptake is incredibly low. Science is not a discourse that holds sway. Discourses that appeal to reason do not hold sway. There is no authority in knowledge. Authority is gods and gods alone. Those parts of the USA are not secular at all. It's hard to get those places to vaccinate themselves because their primary discourse isn't modern. It's just two sets of different civilizations speaking past one another. 

Given the historic attitude toward the state as a necessary evil, rather than a good, and the lack of any modern social welfare system that is trusted with regard to healthcare, there is no way to bridge this gap.

What has depressed me about the US's embarassing uptake isn't just what it means for now - because I live in a state in the Northeast that has solid (mediocre) uptake.  It depresses me because throughout this crisis, the USA has demonstrated all its flaws, and no national identity or will. Declining states will face harsher tests than this one, global warming for certain, but historically, likely war.

In the UK, like here, they started vaccinating people based on age and medical history so that those most at risk from the virus would have protection first. Let's say, for example, that this is 30% of the population. That is, if someone from this 30% does get infected then they are much likelier to have serious complications.

At the other end of things there are the 30% who mostly won't have complications. This is mostly younger people but also could be others who are preternaturally good at fighting disease. 

Right now the UK is 50% fully vaccinated and it's known that being fully vaccinated confers a 90% protection **across the entire population**. This means when you average over everybody kids, old people, professional athletes, people with cystic fibrosis, we find that protection against becoming infected is 90%.

But the vaccinated population isn't uniform. It's 30% those most at risk and 20% normies. Meanwhile the unvaccinated population is 20% normies and 30% at very little risk.

Saying ""10% of hospitalizations were people who were fully vaccinated"" is a truthful statement. But if you ignore the demographic information, we get a picture of a vaccine that is less effective than it actually is. This is because, right now, the fully vaccinated population is a less healthy group of people than the unvaccinated population. The math goes

unhealthy + vaccine = 10% of hospitalizations

healthy + no vaccine = 90% of hospitalizations

If the vaccine did absolutely nothing, you'd expect to see far more hospitalizations from the unhealthy group. And indeed, this is exactly what we did see when there was no vaccine. People aged 50+ used to make up 75% of hospitalizations. But now, despite these two groups being equal in size (50% of total), the unhealthy one makes up only 10% of hospitalizations because their protection is very very strong.",,,1624305708,{},h2koeay,False,t3_o400c9,False,False,t1_h2h5iy8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o400c9/delta_variant_begins_to_spread_threatening_eus/h2koeay/,1624609829,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_5fw801iq,False,False,,

The first issue was vaccine production. It's not easy to produce enough vaccines for a country of 1.4 billion. Not so much of an issue now.

The politics in India is also pretty grim. State governments different from the Central Government don't waste a single opportunity to mess things up so that the centre could be blamed. Not to say that Centre doesn't mess up but the politicians in general prioritize fucking each other than public welfare.

The 8 million vaccines today that people are happy about is probably the pinnacle of daily doses delivered. India with its massive population and inept education system is riddled with people either not educated enough to understand that vaccines are life savers or are just straight up anti-vaxxers. 

Media will not cover this because it's probably not juicy enough or doesn't push their agenda. Like the polio vaccination drive, there are health workers who visit villages trying to deliver vaccine to the remotest possible places. Most of them come back with 1 or 2 vials consumed or are straight up chased away.

Then there are people from a certain community who believe that COVID vaccines are a government conspiracy that will make them infertile. Unfortunately, such differentiated numbers aren't available to the public to see (mostly no one for that matter).

My mother was fully vaccinated in March. According to her at the time(Feb-March) literally no one was coming in to get the vaccine. Part of it was (IMO Justified) the fear of the early roll out of the Indian vaccine, which later proved to be almost as effective as the AZ one.

If internal borders are a no go (which I 100% agree, should be a thing of the past), then fkn enforce stuff at the external border.

Even if we can‚Äôt reach absolute herd immunity, we still need to get as close to it as we possibly can. The more contagious it becomes, the higher that threshold gets. 

&gt; Herd immunity occurs when a large portion of a community (the herd) becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. As a result, the whole community becomes protected ‚Äî not just those who are immune.

&gt; Often, a percentage of the population must be capable of getting a disease in order for it to spread. This is called a threshold proportion. If the proportion of the population that is immune to the disease is greater than this threshold, the spread of the disease will decline. This is known as the herd immunity threshold.

It varies from disease to disease. **The more contagious a disease is, the greater the proportion of the population that needs to be immune to the disease to stop its spread**. For example, the measles is a highly contagious illness. It's estimated that 94% of the population must be immune to interrupt the chain of transmission.

It is possible to use that as leverage towards the side of getting vaccinated.  Particularly when their ""reasons"" are actual propaganda, old or misinformation.

Just as a really easy example, the CDC at one point was advising people to not get vaccinated if it was within 90 days of a covid-19 infection.

People that had Covid heard this and never heard the new reverse decision of ""people *with active* Covid should not get vaccinated so that positive people are not coming to the vaccination centers, but as soon as you are out of Isolation you can get vaccinated"".  Others conflated ""people that have received monoclonal antibody treatment should not get vaccinated in the 90 days after that"".  

I think overall what needs to be understood, is that this is somewhat of a self protection mechanism that we are trying to circumvent, and the way to do that is through discussion, honesty, and currently known facts, not dismissal. Thats gets nobody vaccinated, and if they didn't go to the big vax sites, maybe they will talk to their own doctor.  

That I know of there is *NO* medical reason for anybody not to get vaccinated, outside of being under 12 right now.

Why should insurance companies have to pay for those that refuse to be responsible with money we all pay in higher premiums?

According to CDC, The vaccines have given adverse reactions to about 5 in every million doses given, which is about 0.0005%.
It really comes down to math. It‚Äôs that simple. You are about 2800x more likely to die from Covid than the vaccine if you‚Äôre 55-64,  5400x if you‚Äôre 65-74, etc.

Then you can conversely ask, ""What would convince you to become vaccinated?""

Give it time, and research his points as you have time for, and that way, you can bring it up again in the future, and not just plop it on him all at once.  Maybe some of those barriers to vaccination can be broken over time, and he may be more willing in the future.

AZ and other viral vector vaccines have a disadvantage because for the second dose, the body can recognize the ‚Äúcarrier‚Äù virus (the dead virus with covid proteins attached) and kill the vaccine before it can replicate into spike proteins. This means the second dose of AZ can often be less effective, and is believed by many to be the reason why waiting longer between AZ doses gives better immunity, because your body forgets the carrier virus over time more than COVID. 

The Russian Sputnik vaccine is also a viral vector vaccine, but it‚Äôs special because the second dose uses a different viral vector. This prevents the aforementioned second dose issue, and is believed to by why Sputnik is close to mRNA‚Äôs effectiveness.

I do want to highlight this because the US has decided that you are fully vaccinated 2 weeks after receiving J&amp;J, but it's pretty clear from the clinical trial data that efficacy continues increasing for at least 5-6 weeks after the shot - which is just like waiting two weeks after dose 2 of an mRNA vaccine. So if you are concerned about it being less effective it makes sense to continue taking extra precautions for 5-6 weeks, not just 2. 

But beyond that, if it's a choice of J&amp;J now or Pfizer sometime in the distant future, get the J&amp;J now! It's a good vaccine.

25% is not enough to stop the Delta variant, that is true. But 70% should be.
It is important to push for that threshold. Many states in the US are about to reach it, while others won‚Äôt. Same with countries worldwide. What I expect to see in the Fall is a wave that would be inversely proportional with the vaccination rate. 

That expert is correct that COVID is not going away properly ever, but our goal through high vaccination rate is to limit its impact on healthcare system (and death toll) to be comparable or less than the flu every year.

&gt;One possible solution to this fear (while respecting the body autonomy of all parties involved) would be for first responder facilities to offer some kind of legal form for people who share your fears to sign that you do not wish to receive treatment, even emergency life saving treatment, from anyone who has not proven themselves vaccinated.

No. This reduces the level of care to the public and puts the onus on them to seek out and file some form prior to any sort of emergency. Effectively zero people will use it. The best option is to make employment contingent on getting vaccinated. You can't reasonably be a first responder if you are putting your patients at risk. Don't like it? You have the freedom to choose a different career. A middleground that I'd be okay with is if those unvaccinated responders were liable for any infections that might be traced back to them. Another option is daily rapid pcr testing for those who choose to stay unvaccinated and whenever it comes up positive they get sent home and don't get paid.",,,1624304857,{},h2kmifc,False,t3_o45l5x,False,True,t1_h2h7kxu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o45l5x/many_la_cops_and_firefighters_arent_vaccinated/h2kmifc/,1624608881,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_5fw801iq,False,False,,

**TL, DR:** There isn't so much evolutionary pressure towards a milder disease when it can spread asymptomatically or presymptomatically.

The evolutionary pressure is obviously, by definition, for higher transmission. With many viruses, the carrier isn't contagious until they're symptomatic, and if the symptoms are too severe they're not going to interact with other people so much. Hence in that case less severe symptoms lead to greater transmission.

But the problem with this coronavirus is that the carrier is contagious before showing symptoms. Once they get symptoms, they may self isolate, but by then the virus has spread onwards. And if you're self isolating because of the symptoms, how bad those symptoms turn out to be doesn't really make much difference to the transmission of the virus.",,,1624304779,{},h2kmc4r,False,t3_o4yne2,False,False,t1_h2kamf8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o4yne2/the_us_has_a_higher_rate_of_vaccine_opposition/h2kmc4r/,1624608792,13,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_3k581krx,False,False,,

We do this every single day at pretty much every hospital in the world. Guess what? It works fine. It works against pink eye and measles, which are oh-dear-god-levels more of infectious.

But sure! Let's praise the previous administration for closing the China pandemic detection team, cut ties to WHO warning systems, insisted on re-creating a US specific Covid detection kit which didn't work at all, refused to activate defense production acts to make more PPE, or accept PPE from other countries including China. People were renting private aircraft or borrowing them from sports teams to fly to China and pick up donated supplies because the government wouldn't let Chinese aircraft come to drop them off.

[],,chilladipa,,,,,,[],"A new study from researchers in the United Kingdom has found that the coronavirus may cause long-term brain loss and could be the reason some COVID-19 patients lose their sense of smell and taste. ¬†

""In short, the study suggests that there could be some long-term loss of brain tissue from COVID, and that would have some long-term consequences,"" former FDA Director Scott Gottlieb, MD,¬†said¬†on CNBC's¬†The News with Shepard Smith.

""You could compensate for that over time, so the symptoms of that may go away, but you're never going to regain the tissue if, in fact, it's being destroyed as a result of the virus,"" said Gottlieb, who is also a CNBC contributor.

According to¬†the study, researchers in the United Kingdom had access to brain image testing on about 40,000 people that was done before the start of the coronavirus pandemic.¬†

In 2021, they asked hundreds of those people to come back for more brain scans. Almost 800 responded. Of those patients, 404 had tested positive for COVID-19, and 394 had usable brain scans that were taken before and after the pandemic.

Comparison of the before-and-after brain scans found ""significant effects of COVID-19 in the brain with a loss of grey matter""¬†in parts of the brain connected to smell and taste.

""All significant results were found in the primary or secondary cortical gustatory and olfactory areas, in the left hemisphere, using grey matter information (volume, thickness),"" the study found.

Loss of smell and taste is one of¬†the hallmarks¬†of a COVID-19 infection. Research shows it can continue up to 5 months after the virus first strikes.

""The diminishment in the amount of cortical tissue happened to be in regions of the brain that are close to the places that are responsible for smell,"" Gottlieb said. ""What it suggests is that the smell, the loss of smell, is just an effect of a more primary process that's underway, and that process is actually shrinking of cortical tissue.""",,,1624294950,{},h2k0fvb,True,t3_o4zvmj,False,True,t3_o4zvmj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o4zvmj/covid_may_cause_longterm_brain_loss_study_says/h2k0fvb/,1624597774,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_6z8harzu,False,False,,

[],,SecretAgentIceBat,#94e044,,28b4e296-5e4b-11ea-aa9a-0edecd70770b,Virologist,dark,[],"Now that tens of millions of Americans are vaccinated against the coronavirus, many are wondering: Do I have enough antibodies to keep me safe?  
For a vast majority of people, the answer is yes. That hasn‚Äôt stopped hordes from stampeding to the local doc-in-a-box for antibody testing. But to get a reliable answer from testing, vaccinated people have to get a specific kind of test, and at the right time.  
Take the test too soon, or rely on one that looks for the wrong antibodies ‚Äî all too easy to do, given the befuddling array of tests now available ‚Äî and you may believe yourself to still be vulnerable when you are not.  
Actually, scientists would prefer that the average vaccinated person not get antibody testing at all, on the grounds that it‚Äôs unnecessary. In clinical trials, the vaccines authorized in the United States provoked a strong antibody response in virtually all of the participants.  
‚ÄúMost people shouldn‚Äôt even be worrying about this,‚Äù said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University.  
But antibody tests can be crucial for people with weak immune systems or those who take certain medications ‚Äî a broad category encompassing millions of people who are recipients of organ donations, have certain blood cancers, or who take steroids or other drugs that suppress the immune system. Mounting evidence suggests that a significant proportion of these people do not produce a sufficient antibody response after vaccination.  
If you must get tested, or just want to, it‚Äôs essential to get the right kind of test, Dr. Iwasaki said: ‚ÄúI feel a little bit hesitant to recommend everybody getting tested, because unless they really understood what the test is doing, people might get this wrong sense of not having developed any antibodies.‚Äù

Early in the pandemic, many commercial tests were designed to look for antibodies to a coronavirus protein called the nucleocapsid, or just N, because after infection, those antibodies were plentiful in the blood.  
But these antibodies are not as powerful as those required to prevent virus infection, nor do they last as long. More important, antibodies to the N protein are not produced by the vaccines authorized in the United States; instead, those vaccines provoke antibodies to another protein sitting on the surface of the virus, called the spike.

If people who were never infected are vaccinated and then are tested for antibodies to the N protein instead of to the spike, they may be in for a rude shock.

David Lat, a 46-year-old legal writer in Manhattan, was hospitalized for Covid-19 for three weeks in March 2020, and he chronicled most of his illness and recovery on Twitter.  
Over the following year, Mr. Lat was tested for antibodies numerous times ‚Äî when he went to his pulmonologist or cardiologist for follow-ups, for example, or to donate plasma. His antibody levels were high in June 2020 but steadily fell over the following months.

The decline ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt worry me,‚Äù Mr. Lat recalled recently. ‚ÄúI had been told to expect that they would naturally wane, but I was just happy that I was still positive.‚Äù  
Mr. Lat was fully vaccinated by March 22 of this year. But an antibody test on April 21, ordered by his cardiologist, was barely positive. Mr. Lat was stunned: ‚ÄúI would have thought a month after being immunized, I would have antibodies through the roof.‚Äù  
Mr. Lat turned to Twitter for an explanation. Florian Krammer, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, responded, asking Mr. Lat which test had been used. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when I looked at the fine print on the test,‚Äù Mr. Lat said. He realized it was a test for antibodies to the N protein, not to the spike.  
‚ÄúIt seems that by default, they just give you the nucleocapsid one,‚Äù Mr. Lat said. ‚ÄúI never thought to ask for a different one.‚Äù  
In May, the Food and Drug Administration recommended against the use of antibody tests for assessing immunity ‚Äî a decision that has drawn criticism from some scientists ‚Äî and provided only bare-bones information about testing to health care providers. Many doctors are still unaware of the differences between antibody tests, or the fact that the tests measure just one form of immunity to the virus.  
Rapid tests that are commonly available deliver a yes-no result and may miss low levels of antibodies. A certain type of lab test, called an Elisa test, may offer a semi-quantitative estimate of antibodies to the spike protein.  
It‚Äôs also important to wait to be tested at least two weeks after the second shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, when antibody levels will have risen enough to be detectable. For some people receiving the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, that period may be as long as four weeks.  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the timing and the antigen and the sensitivity of the assay ‚Äî these are going to be very important,‚Äù Dr. Iwasaki said.  
In November, the World Health Organization set standards for antibody testing, allowing for comparison of different tests. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of good tests out there now,‚Äù Dr. Krammer said. ‚ÄúLittle by little, all these manufacturers, all these places that run them are adapting to international units.‚Äù  
Antibodies are just one aspect of immunity, noted Dr. Dorry Segev, a transplant surgeon and researcher at Johns Hopkins University: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot happening under the surface that antibody tests are not directly measuring.‚Äù The body also maintains so-called cellular immunity, a complex network of defenders that also responds to invaders.  
Still, for someone who is vaccinated but immunocompromised, it may be very helpful to know that protection against the virus isn‚Äôt what it should be, he said. For example, a transplant patient with poor antibody levels might be able to use test results to convince an employer that he or she should continue to work remotely.  
Mr. Lat has not sought another test. Just learning that the vaccine most likely has given him a fresh increase of antibodies, despite his test results, was reassurance enough: ‚ÄúI trust that the vaccines work.‚Äù",,,1624294697,{},h2jzuz4,True,t3_o4zroi,False,False,t3_o4zroi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o4zroi/wondering_if_the_vaccine_worked_get_the_right/h2jzuz4/,1624597471,1,True,True,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_jvdfd,False,True,moderator,

Like you rightly pointed out, most of our population have zero natural immunity because 99% of us have never gotten covid. The ONLY way out is really, to vaccinate. THANKFULLY our vaccination drive have been going well thus far - probably the best out of the ""zero covid"" countries. &gt;50% of our population have been jabbed at least once, and &gt;30% fully jabbed. Our national vaccination drive uses Pfizer and Moderna.

Estimates are that by August, we will reach 50% fully jabbed and by October, 75%. We don't know how exactly we are going to ease out of restrictions yet that have been around for certain extent since March 2020, the gov't is working on a roadmap, but we know they will be tied with the 50% and 75% milestones. I can tell you most in Singapore are sick of this state of affairs already. We are looking forward to those milestones now.

A member of Tokyo Olympics Organising Committee said, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt deny that they are obsessed with making money but they are trying to save their face‚Äù. ‚ÄúHaving no spectators means they would be forced to pay back the profit gained from the tickets, roughly 90 billion yen‚Äù. ‚ÄúIn addition, if there‚Äôs no local spectators, these personnels from overseas may stick out and they‚Äôll be the subject of criticism. Covering them up with spectators is necessary‚Äù. ‚ÄúAlso they simply want to hype the games. Having spectators can stir up excitement and it may give an impression of success‚Äù. Another source says that sponsors won‚Äôt allow it because they want the premium tickets for not themselves but their clients.

If you ask me they just seem to want to save their face. Japanese REALLY care about their reputation. It‚Äôs the reason why Japanese people are often seen as ‚Äúpolite and nice‚Äù people. Oh I‚Äôm Japanese by the way.

[],,Viewfromthe31stfloor,,,,,,[],"&gt;Infections from a dangerous new coronavirus variant are surging across Colorado, causing health officials to amp up the urgency in their messages for people to get vaccinated.

&gt;The Delta variant, which is believed to have originated in India and is also known as the B.1.617.2 variant, was first identified in Colorado in late April. By the first week of this month ‚Äî a period of about six weeks ‚Äî it had grown to account for an estimated 40% of all new infections in Colorado.

&gt;For comparison, it took eight weeks for the Alpha variant ‚Äî also known as the B.1.1.7 or United Kingdom variant ‚Äî to reach 40% of the state‚Äôs total cases. As of early June, that variant made up an estimated 48% of total cases in Colorado, but its share is falling as Delta‚Äôs rises.

‚Ä¶

&gt;But, for most people who have been fully vaccinated, this news shouldn‚Äôt cause too much alarm. While the vaccines are believed to be slightly less effective against the Delta variant compared with other forms of the virus, they still offer strong protection.

&gt;A study in the United Kingdom, for instance, found that two doses of the Pfizer vaccine are 96% effective against the Delta variant at preventing severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.

&gt;For unvaccinated people, it‚Äôs a different story.

&gt;The high transmissibility of the variant means it is less likely people will be able to avoid the virus without protection from a vaccine, Herlihy said. The variant is just too good at jumping from vulnerable person to vulnerable person.

&gt;And that means, even as the state opens back up and life returns to its pre-pandemic norms, there is more danger now to people who aren‚Äôt vaccinated.

&gt;‚ÄùI would say, at this point in the pandemic, the risk to unvaccinated individuals is greater than it was several months ago,‚Äù Herlihy said.",,,1624298164,{},h2k7psi,True,t3_o511t9,False,False,t3_o511t9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o511t9/the_delta_coronavirus_variant_is_exploding_across/h2k7psi/,1624601448,29,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_3nelaphm,False,True,,

Before the pandemic, Celso Vigo walked for 90 minutes each day through the streets of Serrana, a town of 45,000 people surrounded by sugarcane Ô¨Å¬Åelds in the state of S√£o Paulo. But when covid¬≠19 hit, the 75-¬≠year-¬≠old retired bank clerk, who played football ‚Äúwell into my 60s‚Äù, was reduced to doing loops around his house. It reminded him of how Brazil, too, was going in circles. After a second wave killed 87,000 people in April, cases and deaths remain high.  
  
But Serrana was given a way out. Between February and April, all adults were oÔ¨Ä¬êered jabs as part of a study by the Butantan Institute, which produces CoronaVac, a vaccine developed by Sino¬≠vac, a Chinese Ô¨Å¬Årm. More than 95% of serranenses got jabbed, despite Jair Bolso¬≠ naro, the president, claiming that it was unsafe. Preliminary results released on May 31st showed that symptomatic cases and deaths fell by 80% and 95%, re¬≠spectively. Only two covid¬≠19 patients remain hospitalised in the local clinic (both refused the vaccine). Mr Vigo is once again pounding the pavements.  
  
Serrana is a tantalising glimpse of an alternative reality in Brazil‚Äîone in which Mr Bolsonaro did not squander his chances to mount an eÔ¨Ä¬êective public¬≠ health campaign and, later, to buy vac¬≠cines. But the study also has global im¬≠plications. In phase three trials, Corona¬≠Vac had eÔ¨É¬ècacy rates as low as 50%, the minimum required by the who. The lower the eÔ¨É¬ècacy, the higher the share of people who must be jabbed to slow con¬≠tagion. The trial in Serrana sought to discover that share. The town was split into four cohorts, that got jabbed in successive weeks. Contagion dropped dramatically after three out of the four had received two doses of the vaccine, suggesting that herd immunity is at¬≠tained at around 75%.  
  
These results could boost vaccine uptake across Brazil, hopes Ethel Maciel, an epidemiologist. But 75% is a long way oÔ¨Ä¬ê. Only 11% of Brazilians are fully vacci¬≠nated, and the rate has slowed because of a shortage of ingredients for CoronaVac, which are imported from China. Chile, which has vaccinated 45% of its pop¬≠ulation, mostly with CoronaVac, is also suÔ¨Ä¬êering near ¬≠record cases.  
  
But Serrana itself has become an oasis. On a recent morning, children ran round a fountain in the plaza. Across the street a fabric shop that caters to elderly women had a steady stream of custom¬≠ers. A gang of old men occupied their usual benches. They discussed Mr Bolso¬≠ naro‚Äôs decision to host the Copa Am√©rica, a football tournament, even though a third wave seems imminent. ‚ÄúStupid,‚Äù a 97¬≠year¬≠old said. Half of them scattered when an outsider showed up. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still scared,‚Äù explained Florivaldo Leandro, a retired police oÔ¨É¬ècer. Serrana‚Äôs calm came at a cost, he said. ‚ÄúWe lost friends, neighbours and relatives.
