Even more promising: this medicine should be effective against all RNA viruses.  So influenza, measles, Ebola, enteroviruses, Zika, RSV, norovirus, etc.

Now, let’s be realistic.  In most RNA virus infections, viral loads peak just around the time that symptoms begin, so these antiviral drugs can push the viral loads down a bit faster, but they usually have modest effects on the clinical course.  That’s why anti-influenza medicines like oseltamivir (TAMIFLU) and baloxivir (XOFLUZA) only slightly reduce the duration of symptoms and even then only when given within 48h of symptom onset.

And parties like the NDP, BQ, and Green Party routinely win seats which gives them power at the federal level both as voters, and as kingmakers when no party forms an absolute majority. A vote for the NDP isn't a throwaway in the same way that voting libertarian is in the US.

The biggest reason for the difference is, presumably, that instead of voting for delegates who have no power except being able to vote for a president, Canadians are voting for MPs that actually have a full time job representing their district and voting on policies while they are in office. That's enough to give parties who only have local appeal a path towards power. 

In theory votes for a representative in the US congress should allow more small parties to thrive in the US but in practice people just pick a president and then vote down the ticket for people who will help that president actually get things done so independents have a very hard time getting taken seriously.

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

The United States has less deaths per capita than Italy, the UK, Hungary, Belgium, Portugal, Slovenia, and Czechia. 

...but even your very actions - which in aggregate contributed to the pandemic perpetuating itself - are the very things that keep conditions worse, making businesses suffer more, resulting in more unemployment etc, which I would think you could empathize enough with to have thought twice about your behavior.

My actions do not change anything.  The government has been in control of lockdowns the entire time.  And the end date was always going to be when enough people were vaccinated, regardless of the number of cases leading up to that.  That's becoming incredibly apparent as we approach summer and vaccinations are ramping up.  Do you really think we could have reopened any sooner with the right leadership and policies?  What could the US have done to resume any level of normalcy before summer of 2021, when even countries like the UK and Italy where citizens trust the government failed completely?

&gt;Somehow, the fact that you can’t connect complete federal inaction for 1 year, to 500,000+ deaths, when there is data to show that even wearing masks would have brought that number lower by hundreds of thousands

[Here is the actual data on mask mandates.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/cdc-study-finds-easing-mask-mandates-led-to-higher-covid-cases-and-deaths.html)  It found that mandates along with restaurant closures resulted in a single-digit % reduction in cases.  A nationwide mask mandate wouldn't have saved ""hundreds of thousands"" of lives, and real-world effectiveness of masks will never be close to as effective as lab effectiveness.  Even if you can enforce the mandated 100% in public, it's completely undermined when people can and will socialize in private.

I don't wanna be a defeatist, but I don't see what other approach I can take.  In theory yes we could have ended this pandemic last spring if we just all stayed home for two weeks and wore masks, but in reality that's not possible.  It's like saying we could eradicate obesity if people just followed government dietary guidelines, then getting upset when people don't follow those guidelines and keep being obese.",,,1615173188,{},gq67c2j,False,t3_lzzzgj,False,True,t1_gq65qfj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lzzzgj/houston_mayor_turner_asks_bars_to_cancel_plans/gq67c2j/,1615173199,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Yeah, we still have relatively high levels of virus circulating.

If we want more government goodies, that means less take-home cash. Much less for the rich, but *all* of us are going to need to make some level of sacrifice.

 In any case, you should ask your primary care doctor and/or insurance provider.

I'm sorry that I'm unable to be more helpful.  The only real useful thing I can say is that I've dealt with depression for a long time, and I have seen an enormous number of friends and family affected by symptoms of depression this year, particularly this winter (Northern hemisphere). 

But is it clinically useful to call it depression when there are very real reasons to feel shitty? Idk. My opinion would be that they'd benefit from therapy, but rushing to take drugs seems questionable- that stuff is best reserved for people who are chronically depressed even in good times- when there is no clear cause for their unhappiness. If your dog gets run over, you should feel said and medicating it away (not that it works that way anyway) shouldn't be the goal. 

You can definitely ask your Primary Care provider and/or your insurer. But you can also take the simple steps that don't require a doctor- exercise and good diet, socializing to the extent you are able, scheduling activities, talking to friends/family, etc. The basic stuff. There is also a lot of reason to feel hopeful because the pandemic is easing in many places, winter in the northern hemisphere is lifting, etc",,,1615242612,{},gq9if66,False,t3_m0hwlt,False,True,t1_gq9fkur,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m0hwlt/cdc_more_people_in_us_fully_vaccinated_than/gq9if66/,1615246822,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

While it’s great you are not a conspiracy theorist, it’s clear your “research” might benefit from better sources, because while the pandemic has had immense costs on people in every country, obviously certain policies and actions have had dramatic impact on the downstream consequences. The US has the highest recorded death rate from COVID per capita in the world, with clear differences in both policies and results from peer countries, and that is one of the most salient and basic facts about this pandemic. If your research has not shown this, then it demonstrates clear bias, which would be concordant with the fact that you somehow thought it was ok to go to bars in “defiance of lockdowns” - the very basic policies we depended on to work for a limited time, among else. Yes, obviously you did not cause the pandemic, and you can tell yourself that you didn’t kill anyone’s grandma all you want, but even your very actions - which in aggregate contributed to the pandemic perpetuating itself - are the very things that keep conditions worse, making businesses suffer more, resulting in more unemployment etc, which I would think you could empathize enough with to have thought twice about your behavior.

You are right in that shaming people individually won’t help, but people should definitely feel ashamed going to bars in “defiance” of stated policies. I completely agree that far more blame must be directed towards governments. I have family members in other countries that living under similar restrictions, until they are vaccinated and can reopen fully, but they at least have vastly lower case rates and are not fearful of their lives to the extent so many here have to still be. Somehow, the fact that you can’t connect complete federal inaction for 1 year, to 500,000+ deaths, when there is data to show that even wearing masks would have brought that number lower by hundreds of thousands (nothing to say of an actual policy response and government support for people like yourself that were financially impacted) makes me even less sympathetic to your original post.",,,1615172286,{},gq65qfj,False,t3_lzzzgj,False,True,t1_gq64qtk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lzzzgj/houston_mayor_turner_asks_bars_to_cancel_plans/gq65qfj/,1615172297,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Shaming people for flouting guidelines isn't going to make them comply, and the US government doesn't have the authority to enforce a real lockdown like the oned in New Zealand and Australia.

I have multiple nurses and teachers in my family who are underworked and unhappy with restrictions.  One of my relatives owns a bar and is on the brink of bankruptcy.

And the icing on all the shit cake is that I can look at states and countries that aggressively locked down, compare them to states and countries that didn't lock down at all, and I literally can't find any evidence suggesting that anything short of a full-blown lockdown (where police arrest you if you leave your house) would have drastically changed anything.

We have ClassicStrain with something like R=0.8-1 that's dropping in prevalence steadily.  We also have B.1.1.7 (UK) with something like R=1.2-1.4 that's growing dramatically.  Combine the two and we get a semi flat (I'm pretty sure it's still dropping as of today's cases, aka ~2 weeks ago).

Project that forward not very far and we get back up to dramatic exponential growth from B.1.1.7 flying away and ClassicStrain disappearing.  But to counter that we also have vaccinations and warmer weather coming.  But to counter *that*, we also have a large portion of the country deciding that the pandemic is over and going out partying.

B.1.1.7 responds well to vaccinations, but to drop that 1.2-1.4 down back under 1 will take 17-30% of the remaining unvaccinated population to be vaccinated - that's gotta be weeks away.  Is it more or less weeks than it'll take for it to start causing problems?  Who knows.

The real problem here is that antibodies to B.1.1.7 don't seem to work very well against ClassicStrain or B.1.351 (SA), even though antibodies from both of those strains work well against B.1.1.7.  So everyone who catches B.1.1.7 still needs to be vaccinated or catch a second strain.

And yet, it's not fully clear that another surge from B.1.1.7 would be a problem, but there's a high chance it would.  Of course the big fear is hospitals getting overwhelmed, and that seems unlikely now - but it's hard to be sure.  The demographics of the unvaccinated population are both that they're less likely to need hospitalization, but also that they have much shorter hospital stays and better outcomes.  But we haven't actually seen this in action yet: in Colorado, our hospitalization rate (hospitalizations/cases) remains steady at 4-5%, and our CFR (deaths/cases) has dropped from 1.5% in early December when hospitals were strained down to 1.0%, but looks like it's staying steady there.  A 1.0% mortality rate (or 0.4% if we account for missing cases) would certainly be problematic.  But if we could get that down to 0.1%, like some people claim the flu has, then we could have another wave of 100 million infections and only have another 100k deaths.

I'm reacting to this bit from the article:

&gt;Relying on a BMI to judge one’s risk of serious health conditions is complicated. Many healthy people still fall in the “overweight” category based on their body proportions, with no distinction made between bone density, muscle mass and body fat.

&gt;This is particularly the case for women, Black adults and people with low incomes who make up the majority of Americans who have been diagnosed with obesity by such standards. That has a lot to do with the fact that the original calculus was developed by and for white men.

This is basically just nonsensical. The problem relating women to BMI is that they're *more* likely to be overfat at a given BMI than men, it underdiagnoses their likelihood of obesity-related problems. The low income part seems bizarre - there's no plausible narrative in which it turns out that there are actually quite a few low income people that just have too much muscle mass and bone density.

I think this becomes even more true with your proposal - basically everyone that has a BMI over 40 is unhealthy due to obesity and no amount of handwaving about how it was developed by white men is going to change that.",,,1615238280,{},gq98yum,False,t3_m0oy1l,False,False,t1_gq97jo9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m0oy1l/a_high_bmi_can_get_you_vaccinated_in_utah_junk/gq98yum/,1615242308,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You are, at a minimum, being *very* misleading by asserting with such confidence that immunity fades after three months and (in a sibling comment) that people who disagree are spreading misinformation. The evidence, over and over again, is that reinfection is exceedingly rare  - and severe illness or even just symptoms after a reinfection rarer still - over a year into the pandemic.

[Reinfection Rates among Patients who Previously Tested Positive for COVID-19: a Retrospective Cohort Study](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ll6kbl/reinfection_rates_among_patients_who_previously/)

&gt; **Conclusions:** Prior infection in patients with COVID-19 was highly protective against reinfection and symptomatic disease. Protective effectiveness increased over time, suggesting that viral shedding or ongoing immune response may persist beyond 90 days and may not represent true reinfection.

[A 1 to 1000 SARS-CoV-2 reinfection proportion in members of a large healthcare provider in Israel: a preliminary report](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m0ndfi/a_1_to_1000_sarscov2_reinfection_proportion_in/)

&gt; we conducted a large-scale assessment on the country level of the possible occurrence of COVID-19 reinfection within the members of a large healthcare provider in Israel. Out of 149,735 individuals with a documented positive PCR test between March 2020 and January 2021, 154 had two positive PCR tests at least 100 days apart, reflecting a reinfection proportion of 1 per 1000.

[Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with protection against symptomatic reinfection](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kqra86/prior_sarscov2_infection_is_associated_with/)

&gt; Recent unpublished studies in HCWs reported no evidence of symptomatic reinfection, suggesting that immunity is maintained for at least 6 months. In these studies there was a relatively low event rate (94 and 20 symptomatic infections respectively). [...] Our data confirms and extends these findings. Despite 290 symptomatic infections in 10,137 non-immune HCWs, there were no symptomatic reinfections in over 1000 HCWs with past infection.

Jail is where one goes pre-trial or where a misdemeanor sentence is served. In some states, one may stay in jail until such time as the cases of all co-defendants are adjudicated, even if convicted of a felony. If this involves a murder case, that stay may be years. 

Prison is where one convicted of a felony goes after their case is adjudicated.  

Someone in jail should be the priority over someone in prison. 

Here is my personal issue in prisons and to a lesser extent jails, the warden has basically god like powers to run their facility. They are the only state employees who can actually usurp federal agency protocols and order Federal agents around in their facility. They have the ability to control who comes in and out of their facility. They could establish protocols for testing of guards and could lock down to keep prisoners safe. At least here, the biggest risk to the inmates was the guards. A large party of prison guards became a super spreader event and at least 2 of my former classmates contracted COVID-19 after visiting their clients.  

Personally, I would have had the prisons go on lockdown and have strict daily testing of guards (which was feasible before the vaccine was out) and anyone else entering the facility. I would rely on health experts to design a stringent intake priotocol for new inmates..  From there, guards, employees of companies contracted to enter prisons, and attorneys of record in criminal matters would have been in my early list for vaccines.  Anyone whom goes to the facility and could bring the illness basically. 

I believe this approach would have prevented the hard feelings that we have seen while simultaneously showing that we are trying to keep prisoners as safe as possible without giving the idea they are prioritized.

The CDC discourages antibody testing for assessing immunity after getting the vaccine. In clinical trials, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were shown to protect people against the virus 95 percent of the time and 94 percent of the time, respectively. But that does not mean everyone who gets the vaccine would test positive for antibodies, Murphy said.

Commercial antibody tests may not be searching for the same antibodies that the vaccine triggers. Someone who has had the vaccine and is immune to the virus may still test negative for certain antibodies, Murphy explained.

Mutated virus may reinfect people already stricken once with covid-19, sparking debate and concerns

In any case, Murphy added, antibodies are only part of a person’s immune system response. Some studies have shown that protective T cells, a white blood cell that helps protect against disease, have been elevated in some patients with covid, even though the patients had no detectable antibodies.

“After the vaccines, a lot people are going to get antibody testing — ‘Oh, I want to see if it’s working.’ It actually has very little correlation,” he said. “Many people will test negative on the antibody test, and that does not mean the vaccine didn’t work.”

Then when should I get an antibody test?

Health experts say antibody testing is useful in assessing the prevalence of the disease in the community to inform public health officials.

For individuals, Murphy said the tests “can tell you about past exposure to the virus.”
“But it doesn’t change anything else. It doesn’t change the fact that you can get infected again from the regular virus, and it may not offer you enough protection from these variants that are out there,” he said.

So, when it comes to the vaccine, he said, testing is useless. “Even if you’re positive [for covid antibodies], you would still get the vaccine. If you’re negative, you would get the vaccine. And then after the vaccine, it really doesn’t matter whether that antibody test is positive or negative. It doesn’t help you at all.”",,,1615176340,{},gq6crdl,False,t3_lzux8u,False,True,t1_gq5y85d,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lzux8u/coronavirus_vaccinated_nursing_moms_likely_pass/gq6crdl/,1615176350,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I think any surge will be mild, but there is evidence the UK strain is spreading despite the OG on the decline. Spring and increasing vaccinations will likely mitigate this before it becomes much of a problem.

However if I am wrong and this or some other variant becomes problematic it could set this timetable back a few weeks to a few months. Worse if said variant is highly vaccine resistant, which once again I think is very unlikely, but it remains a possibility.

I did a pickup from a Dane County brewery two weeks ago and they had me step away from the door so they could put the beer on a cart for a zero-contact drop. In Milwaukee I did a brewery pickup this past weekend and their bar seats are removed and they're running at 25% capacity at their tabletops (and only 2 tables had people).

Here in Milwaukee it's nothing near business-as-usual, even if things are loosening. Almost every venue is still closed, and several of my favorite restaurants are still takeout-only. This weekend I had a patio beer in the 45 degree weather and I drove by a microbrewery where every outside (distanced) table was also full.

You can't write off interventions just because they don't always work 100% everywhere, and notably Wisconsin being open certainly affected Minnesota, same as South Dakota affected both of us, the same as the southern counties of Wisconsin were affected by Illinois.

In a way, I consider that more positive. Being infected provides some amount of immunity, and not everyone wants to be vaccinated or can be vaccinated. If a third of the country has been infected, then we'd theoretically only need to vaccinate a little more than half of the country for ""herd immunity."" Obviously there will be overlap, but we're also not going to stop at vaccinating half the country. It's a big reason I'm not worried about willingness.

ChAdOx1 (Oxford/Astrazeneca) may not be so great against the SA variant, and we have a lot to learn here.

Pfizer [seems fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lf7uph/neutralization_of_viruses_with_european_south/) against the troubling variants, at least in the lab.

Some, including [that one mink variant,](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/19/danish-covid-mink-variant-very-likely-extinct-but-controversial-cull-continues) have already gone extinct.

Milder cases, especially asymptomatic cases [are worse at spreading](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kcy2e0/weekly_question_thread_week_of_december_14/gg8tp7n/).  

[Pfizer's vaccine may prevent spread and disease.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/loljxz/effectiveness_results_of_the_pfizer_covid19/) Looks like the amount of virus in people who've gotten one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and then infected is [greatly reduced compared to those not vaccinated](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfiqma/decreased_sarscov2_viral_load_following/).

Any answer you get that is either ""yes"" or ""no"" is wrong, for now. We have only ""maybe, probably not"", and it's going to be that way for a long time.

In order to answer the question scientifically (in a decent amount of time), it would require a ""challenge study"" where both vaccinated and unvaccinated people are deliberately exposed to the virus to see if transmission occurs.

The ethical concerns of deliberate exposure prevent us from performing these studies in humans.  It's the same reason that the vaccine trials took so long, we can't deliberately infect people to see if they need hospitalization or die. 

(EDIT: Well, now it looks like I [spoke too soon.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/llw5cu/worlds_first_coronavirus_human_challenge_study/))

However, we did these studies with monkeys and the results look [*really good.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03041-6) They show strong immunity, or [sterilizing immunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/la4fud/immunogenic_bnt162b_vaccines_protect_rhesus/) from multiple vaccine types.  However, it's unlikely that sterilizing immunity would be found in most vaccinated humans, if we even get sterilizing immunity at all. This is still good news. 

Also, you'll notice that any reputable person talking about this subject always says ""may be able to spread"", or ""maybe"", or ""we don't know if"". And that's because there is a small chance that vaccinated people will be able to spread the virus. But it's not a big chance. Doctors, scientists, and regulators are being very careful with their language on this subject, some would argue they're being too careful. That said, if they were to say that ""vaccinated people cannot spread the virus"", and then we find out that in some situations that vaccinated people have spread the virus, [that would end up worse for them than if they hedge for a while.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/los8r9/daily_discussion_thread_february_21_2021/goa8cu0/) So at least to me, the way they're framing it seems pretty reasonable, you just have to put yourself in their shoes.

That said, they seem to be [saying what I've been saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s). 

**Additional Thoughts/Cool Stuff**

Testing and the Positivity Rate: It's been said a lot in other subs that the positivity rate should go up over time as more people are vaccinated and don't require testing. Last year, it was *the* metric to watch, but it will likely wane quickly in importance as overall testing drops.  Don't necessarily worry about sudden high positivity rates, as mass testing will likely drop off pretty quickly, particularly as testing sites are converted to vaccination sites. 

We may want to use our newly found testing and sequencing capacity to test and sequence a higher proportion of flu samples.  This might give us a head start on which flu genetics are circulating, and help eliminate a flu or two.  We're in the single digits of flu cases most places, which is awesome!

Just because [mRNA vaccines aren't 100% effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/)  against the SA variant, *doesn't* [mean that we'll definitely need boosters](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gmu581s/).

I like [thegracefuldork's prediction about vaccine availability](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lcatpp/daily_discussion_thread_february_04_2021/gm0bwc8/) more than my own previous prediction.  Not because it's ""rosier"", but because it's just better.

**Which vaccine should I get?**

When someone asks me what my favorite beer is, the answer is always the same.

It's the one in front of me.

So get the first vaccine you can, the differences are pretty minor.


[**Conclusions**](https://gfycat.com/cleantalkativedassie)

Okay, so the vaccines reduce infections, and if someone gets an infection after getting vaccinated, they have fewer and reduced symptoms.  This currently seems to also be true with post vaccination infection with any of the known variants. We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with mild symptoms spread only slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well. 

In other words: A reduction in symptoms is at least correlated with a reduction in the ability to spread the virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections and symptoms in those who do get infected. Therefore, vaccines should reduce spread.

If people develop immunity via clearing an infection, each subsequent variant they are exposed to will just broaden their immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). So they'll have good and broad immunity to a variety of variants, which seems likely to be an indication that they won't catch or spread the virus as well in the future. Same thing happens when someone who is vaccinated is exposed to a new variant. Their immunity is broadened and strengthened by each subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. But remember, so many people will be less likely to spread the virus, so it's pretty unlikely that this reduced level of spread will be sufficient to sustain the virus in the way we have seen over the past year. So if a variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. If they don't become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing to have my mind changed on this with new information though, so don't take this as gospel.

Correct, you for some reason thought I had claimed all schools were closed.  That too was  incorrect and why that comment of yours is irrelevant.

Never said all schools are closed.  Pay attention!

You claimed schools were closed due to lack of funding.  That is incorrect

Correct 

&gt;You can argue schools don’t need more money all you want. 

I never tried to argue that.  Pay attention!

What does this mean?

You claimed schools were closed due to lack of funding.  That is incorrect 

&gt;and were talking about budgets and schools getting more funds. I quote again:

&gt;	“These schools remain closed though. So, why more funding for exactly that when they’re still closed and prior funds haven’t been spent.”

Correct, this was in response to your claim schools are closed due to lack of funding.  I pointed out there is funding still available to these schools under the cares act but they can’t use it due to covid restrictions preventing them from opening up.

Pay attention!

&gt;	The funding goes to all schools. Schools that are open and schools that are closed.

Some what correct and some what incorrect.  A portion of the funds are specifically to assist schools that have  students returning for in-person learning.  Till that happens this funds cannot be used.  

Hence why finding still exist .  Schools shutdown due to covid restrictions can’t use these funds.  

In no way are schools shutdown due to lack of funding as you claimed.

&gt;If the unvaccinated people are from a single household that does not have individuals at risk of severe COVID-19, they can visit with fully vaccinated people indoors, without anyone wearing masks, with a low risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. For example, fully vaccinated grandparents can visit indoors with their unvaccinated healthy daughter and her healthy children without wearing masks or physical distancing, provided none of the unvaccinated family members are at risk of severe COVID-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;If any of the unvaccinated people or their household members are at increased risk of severe COVID-19, all attendees should take precautions including wearing a well-fitted mask, staying at least 6 feet away from others, and visiting outdoors or in a well-ventilated space.  
&gt;  
&gt;For example, if a fully vaccinated individual visits with an unvaccinated friend who is seventy years old and therefore at risk of severe disease,  the visit should take place outdoors, wearing well-fitted masks, and maintaining physical distance (at least 6 feet).

This recommendation appears to be based on some combination of vaccinated people being less likely to transmit virus to unvaccinated people and it not really being that big a deal if unvaccinated people who are at low risk from COVID have some (reduced) risk of getting infected anyway, but still being cautious with the (reduced but still there) possibility that a vaccinated person could spread the virus to a *high risk* unvaccinated person who would be more severely affected by infection, and that unvaccinated people can still spread the virus between each other the same as before.",,,1615227132,{},gq8j5dl,False,t3_m0ax32,False,False,t1_gq8hnpd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m0ax32/daily_discussion_thread_march_08_2021/gq8j5dl/,1615229267,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There are lots of variations and Im sure plenty of other ways to go about it, but a general method is a fake profile that looks fairly real and innocuous is made. This profile is then used to create posts that spread misinformation, division, or dissent. The posts may be original posts, but usually they are comments on something else so that the message will be seen by a broad audience and be disseminated exponentially. Memes and whatnot containing the misinformation or dissent are utilized often. Similar to scam calls, the posts are broadcast to many many many people (an argument could be made that arguing with them spreads it even more), and if they work to sway even a few they are successful.

[],,Im_A_Girl_Damn_It,,,[],,,,text,t2_2080ducs,False,False,[],"I don’t know why everybody focuses on New York but I’m an LVN in California. The last nursing home I worked out made an agreement with local hospitals to accept covid+ admits in exchange for PPE(yet we still had to wear the same N95 for two weeks so idk wtf that PPE went) We were the only facility within like a 50 mile radius doing such and as a result our census never really took a hit (hint hint this is why they did it). They quarantined those patients, but made the staff members work with both the covid patients and the actual nursing home patients. 

Guess how this ended up? Well for starters, the care was awful for covid patients. We got the ones that were either super close to their death bed and now on hospice or the ones that weren’t sick enough for ICU care but still too sick for a rehabilitation facility level of care. 

I remember the worst day I had working in the covid unit. As a nurse (And I’m just an LVN, not even an RN), I had 20 covid positive patients. These were not normal nursing home/rehab patients. They were sick. Probably about half of them were on IV antibiotics which again, as an LVN I had ZERO experience with. That’s when I learned basic PICC care but most of it had to be done by an RN and it was hard to get them back there. 

6 of those patients were having very difficult times keeping their oxygen levels up. Here’s the fun part. I had two oxygen concentrators. The rest had to use tanks, so I had to be very careful to not let the tanks run out. Nobody considered the fact that the covid unit didn’t have oxygen storage and I wasn’t allowed to leave the unit so I had to call my coworkers all day to ask them to bring me more but they were told to only bring one at a time per patient. 

3 of them were actively dying that day. They were alone, sick, just dying. I couldn’t spend a lot of time with them. I failed to comfort them during their final moments because my other patients were all so unstable. 

The long term residents. Almost every single one of them caught covid at some point. Some had no symptoms at all, but a lot of them just died. So many died and despite being in a nursing home had so much life in them and would probably had made it another 5-15 years but covid took that from them. 

I caught covid myself at work. My symptoms didn’t start until I was halfway through a shift one day. When I came back to work after my 14 days, 4 residents I had contact with (noncovid) had tested positive and died. Did I kill them? Did I spread it to them or did they spread it to me? I’ll never know. 

I don’t work there anymore. I now work somewhere that has done a meticulous job with covid and has never had a case and now everyone is vaccinated. When I was at the covid home, I think I went on autopilot a lot to avoid thinking too much about what I was actually dealing with. Now that I’m not in that situation it’s alllllll coming back to me and it was really, really traumatizing. I think about it now and just get really fucking sad and it consumes my thoughts a lot of the time so yeah. I have lung damage too.

We need to support the vaccine effort right now more than ever.

That may well be the best we can reasonably hope for. Suppression to levels that might make you a little ill for a couple days, but not severe levels (or kill you).

Get people immunized ""enough"" to prevent major illness. Giving twice as many folks their 1st shot may be smarter than 1/2 as many getting 2 shots on the current schedule  (Pfizer or Moderna). That's what the UK is doing .. and so far it seems to be working. 

Yeah, give the second dose still, but maybe after 6 weeks (Pfizer) or ?? (Moderna), unless current studies (we're smart enough to be doing them, right?) show 1 dose yields ""adequate"" protection. It's interesting to me those studies weren't part of the original trials.

If you're pessimistic, you see the new more-infectious strains coming in and you know that we're winning battles, but it'll be a long war.

Reality is somewhere in between. That's why epidemiology is a _science_ where we rely on _observations_ and _data_.

Everything is a sum of probabilities. I'm sure we'd all like 100% freedom and 0% people getting sick, but the chances are somewhere away from those extremes. Vaccination prevents some disease, so we can remove some of the restrictions. Opening up will increase disease spread, so it's best done gradually, then monitor the statistics and see what happens. New strains may make more people sick, so we have to monitor that as well, see how the vaccines are holding up against it, maybe get some boosters for people.

The house had the water heater in the garage (that is alien here), was ""lightly"" insulated, and ""kinda off kilter"" considering it was like already 30 years-old when they bought it back in the 80's.  My uncle who was pretty handy as a car mechanic decided to fix it up in his spare time.

My aunt wasn't impressed with it (the fights about it are one of the stories you heard about everytime we met up) until after it was all done and not only because she got a new kitchen out of it, but she noticed it was quieter (interior walls) and cooler in the summer.

My uncle died a couple years back, my aunt moved closer to her family in the coastal part of Texas, and now one of my female cousins and her family lives in the house.  She heard of the cold weather coming lasting for a few days, filled up pots and containers with water, and had shut the water down and drained the pipes just in case.  They got a pool in the backyard for flushing the toilets.  What she didn't expect was the power outage. She rode out the storm and power outage under blankets, ski jackets, and my uncle's old camping heaters.

Back in December, I made the bold ""prediction"" that the second half of January was going to look much better than the first half, and that it would by and large look better every day from there on out. I had multiple people call me an idiot and say that February and March were literally going to be blood bathes and we'd have record deaths the entire time.

I explained my logic then (sheer number of previous infections and natural immunity, vaccines on the way, combined with the ending of the big social holidays) and was still called a fool. And yet I was as spot on as I could have possibly been, with my only flaw being that I thought the fall off in cases would be less than it actually was. They PLUMMUTED.

The new part is fully vaccinated (2+ weeks after final vaccine) people can visit a single unvaccinated household indoors, unmasked and without distancing, provided the household is low-risk for severe disease (not older adults, not pregnant, not with certain medical conditions, etc.). That means in many cases, fully vaccinated grandparents can hug their unvaccinated grandkids again, etc.

Also, fully vaccinated people can meet in groups indoors, unmasked, without social distancing.

Also, fully vaccinated people don't have to test and quarantine just because they are exposed anymore.

Otherwise it'd be a disaster zone!"", and yet if the lockdown was so amazingly effective, and was instituted before the January peak, wouldn't you see much less of a surge in January if the lockdown is the real hero of this story and the reason that the B 1.1.7 variant isn't causing a total bloodbath?

The EU will continue to block exports of vaccines as long as the company does not supply enough, says the president of the European Commission. ""AstraZeneca needs to increase its efforts. Otherwise we cannot allow exports. ""

In an interview with international media, von der Leyen warned that there will be no hesitation in intervening again if AstraZeneca does not increase production and supply for the EU. ""They cannot explain why they do not deliver to the EU. But suddenly they found vaccines to send to Australia. ""The company has said it will also ship vaccines to the EU for the second quarter that are produced outside Europe.

For Italy, the measure was full last week when it appeared that the country would receive less than ten percent of the British-Swedish company in the first quarter than expected. The government therefore blocked the export of a batch of 250,000 corona vaccines from AstraZeneca destined for Australia. It was the first time that this weapon was used. ""I directly supported Prime Minister Draghi's decision,"" said von der Leyen, indicating that if necessary, this will not be the last.

Australian Prime Minister understands why Rome is holding back vaccines
According to insiders, the Commission initially expected up to 120 million doses of AstraZeneca between December and the end of March. The company says it is facing production problems in the EU. ""But we had already agreed before the approval by the European Medicines Agency that they would stockpile,"" said von der Leyen.

Von der Leyen says vaccines produced in Europe have already been exported to more than thirty countries outside the EU. ""This is mainly thanks to Pfizer / BioNTech. It will adhere to the contracts.

&gt; * You should still delay domestic and international travel. If you do travel, you’ll still need to follow CDC requirements and recommendations.

&gt; * You should still watch out for symptoms of COVID-19, especially if you’ve been around someone who is sick. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you should get tested and stay home and away from others.

&gt;Overly trying to not take side?
&gt;
&gt;Is it one thing swedish media is doing, it is to take side. With the ruling government.
&gt;

Not really.


&gt;The way they have backed the swedish strategy (especially in the beginning) and the lack of critical questions at the FHM press conferences is down right ridiculous.
&gt;

Yes, was absolutely backed to begin with, before we had any results. And no, not a lot of critical questions at conferences. As you probably noticed, not any questions praising them either. Press conferences and news in general are very unemotional, and I understand if that's a shock to someone not from Sweden.

&gt;You'd expect people would protest the horribly inefficient and failed laissez-faire strategy that has lead to so many unnecessary deaths, but instead you get protest from nutjobs with 5g signs saying the restrictions are to hard.
&gt;

There is lots and lots of criticism pointed towards loose restrictions. But as I'm sure you're able to understand yourself, those people understand that gathering in groups of hundreds will only make things worse.

&gt;Sweden is so bizarre. It's like they're living in an alternate reality.
&gt;

They quit about three weeks later.  

Why?

Every week they'd get a report of how many crash fatalities there had been, and it had gone up each week.  They went home shaking every day, because ""omg, I killed three people today because of how I programmed the light at such-and-such intersection.""

But that's only based on the last week's numbers.  We know there's 20 million J&amp;J shots this month and 75 or so of both Moderna and Pfizer.

The virus doesn't care about what people ""consider vaccinated"".  The shot is already plenty effective two weeks after the initial shot.
