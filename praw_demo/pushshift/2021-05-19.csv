The hospital system is not overwhelmed. It's just not.

I'm giving the amount of people vaccinated any overall decrease of the spread including from people who've already had the infection, it's extraordinarily unlikely that the hospital will be close to overwhelmed again.

So I guess my question for you is that I keep seeing this type of post where every time something like this happens people keep wanting to wait longer and longer. If they waited till June you'd have people saying why not wait till august.

At some point you have to allow things to start returning to normal when the data shows that it's safe to do so.

That's why the CDC has spent so long saying this for vaccinated people.

But before covid and after covid you're always going to have to deal with the fact that there are going to be people around you in public places who may not be healthy and you're not going to know their overall health and immunization status.

Here's the other problem. If you want to convince undecided people to get a vaccine, you're not doing a very good job of that if you keep telling them that no matter what they're going to have to keep wearing the masks.

I say that because I've talked to a lot of on the fence people who have doubts about the vaccine because they keep seeing people advocating for wearing the masks and they don't understand why people are saying the vaccine is beneficial if nothing is ever going to be allowed to change.

The whole debate inside the US has missed this point.

Arguing about whether people should wear surgical masks is relatively pointless, but encouraging people to wear N95 masks will make a huge difference in tamping down COVID.

&gt;“All of this points to B.1.617.2 outcompeting other variants, including B.1.1.7 and other variants of concern. SPI-M-O is now confident that B.1.617.2 has a significant growth advantage over B.1.1.7, with a current estimate that B.1.617.2 has a transmission advantage of ***more than 50% over B.1.1.7***. Given this, it is increasingly plausible that B.1.617.2 will go on to replace B.1.1.7 in England over time, in the same way that B.1.1.7 replaced other variants at the end of last year.

Obviously rolling back when a significant part of the country is vaccinated and has given you ample people to build a study on to confirm what you suspect is meaningful. 

The bottom line is that if you are vaccinated, you are protected against the virus. 

&gt;Also you ignored every other point I made and continue to insist on only discussing the US. Kinda weird.

I'm discussing general facts about the vaccine.

I'm not disputing any statement that wearing masks if you are unvaccinated is right.

No shit if you live in an area that is almost 90% unvaccinated, they are going to recommend to keep wearing masks.

""The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) is a U.S. agency that was founded in 1983 with the stated goal of promoting democracy abroad.""

This was LITERALLY the 1st fucking paragraph on Wikipedia, its a ""U.S agency""

""Funded primarily by an annual allocation from the U.S. Congress,"" I didn't even bother go down further to read how it has CLEAR connection to US interest, CIA, US foreign policy etc...

And this was just ONE funding source for Reporters Without Borders. If I want, I can dig out hundreds that are absolutely pro US, pro EU and anti China.

Then you literally in the same fucking paragraph admit that it has  ""slight pro-American perspective"" (slight my ass)

And we both know US has publicly admit China is its strategic rival/competitor. Then with your smart IQ of 200, in the same paragraph told me that they are ""they are unbiased"" in their conclusion...

A Times investigation found that Emergent has exercised outsize influence over the Strategic National Stockpile, the nation’s emergency medical reserve; in some years, the company’s anthrax vaccine has accounted for as much as half the stockpile’s budget.

The investigation found that some federal officials felt the company was gouging taxpayers — an issue that also came up at Wednesday’s hearing when Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, demanded to know how much it cost to make the vaccine and what it sold for. Mr. El-Hibri promised to supply the information later.

Company executives also view their coronavirus work as one of the “prime drivers” of its 2020 revenues, according to a memorandum released on Wednesday by committee staff members. The executives were rewarded for what the company’s board called “exemplary overall 2020 corporate performance including significantly outperforming revenue and earnings targets.”

Mr. Kramer received a $1.2 million cash bonus in 2020, the records show, and also sold about $10 million worth of stock this year, in trades that he said were scheduled in advance and approved by the company. Three of the company’s executive vice presidents received bonuses ranging from $445,000 to $462,000 each.

Sean Kirk, the executive responsible for overseeing development and manufacturing operations at all of Emergent’s manufacturing sites, received a special bonus of $100,000 last year, in addition to his regular bonus of $320,611, in part for expanding the company’s contract manufacturing capability to address Covid-19, the documents show. Mr. Kirk is now on personal leave.

Emergent officials “appear to have wasted taxpayer dollars while lining their own pockets,” Ms. Maloney charged.

Mr. Krishnamoorthi asked Mr. Kramer if he would consider turning over his bonus to the American taxpayers.

“I will not make that commitment,” Mr. Kramer replied.

“You are a reputable company that has done yeoman’s work to protect this country in biodefense,” exclaimed Representative Mark E. Green, Republican of Tennessee, adding, “So you gave your folks a bonus for their incredible work.”

Emergent is skilled at working Washington. Its board is stocked with former government officials, and Senate lobbying disclosures show that the company has spent an average of $3 million a year on lobbying over the past decade. That is about the same as two pharmaceutical giants, AstraZeneca and Bristol Myers Squibb, whose annual revenues are at least 17 times higher.

Democrats pressed Mr. Kramer and Mr. El-Hibri about their contacts with Dr. Kadlec, who previously consulted for Emergent. Documents show that Emergent agreed to pay him $120,000 annually between 2012 and 2015 for his consulting work, and that he recommended that Emergent be given a “priority rating” so that the contract could be approved speedily. Dr. Kadlec has said he did not negotiate the deal but did sign off on it.

“Did you or any other Emergent executives speak to or socialize with Dr. Kadlec while these contracts were being issued?” Representative Nydia M. Velázquez, Democrat of New York, asked Mr. Kramer.

“Congresswoman,” he replied carefully, “I did not have any conversations with Dr. Kadlec about this.”

Hours before the hearing began, committee staff members released confidential audits, previously reported by The Times, that cited repeated violations of manufacturing standards. A top federal manufacturing expert echoed those concerns in a June 2020 report, warning that Emergent lacked trained staff and adequate quality control.

“My teenage son’s room gives your facility a run for its money,” Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois, told Mr. Kramer.

Mr. Kramer initially testified that contamination of the Johnson &amp; Johnson doses “was identified through our quality control procedures and checks and balances.” But under questioning, he acknowledged that a Johnson &amp; Johnson lab in the Netherlands had picked up the problem. Johnson &amp; Johnson hired Emergent to produce its vaccine and, at the insistence of the Biden administration, is now asserting greater control over the plant.

The federal government awarded Emergent a $628 million contract last year, mostly to reserve space at the Baltimore plant for vaccine production. Among other things, lawmakers are looking into whether the company leveraged its contacts with a top Trump administration official, Dr. Robert Kadlec, to win that contract and whether federal officials ignored known deficiencies in giving Emergent the work.
Mr. El-Hibri told lawmakers that the government and Johnson &amp; Johnson were aware of the risks.

“Everyone went into this with their eyes wide open, that this is a facility that had never manufactured a licensed product before,” he said. While the Baltimore plant was “not in perfect condition — far from it,” he argued that the facility “had the highest level of state of readiness” among the plants the government had to choose from.

For Republicans, including Mr. Scalise, Wednesday’s session became a vehicle to defend Emergent and the Trump administration, and to raise other virus-related issues: the unproven theory that the coronavirus leaked from a laboratory in China, the “lies of the Communist Party of China,” mask mandates and the Biden administration’s call for a waiver of an international intellectual property agreement.",,,1621470783,{},gyrjw27,True,t3_nglu3z,False,False,t1_gyrjqpy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nglu3z/contamination_woes_hold_back_100_million_vaccine/gyrjw27/,1621554983,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Testifying virtually, Mr. Kramer was joined by the firm’s founder and executive chairman, Fuad El-Hibri, who over the past two decades has expanded Emergent from a small biotech outfit into a company with $1.5 billion in annual revenues. Executive compensation documents made public by the subcommittee show that the company’s board praised Mr. El-Hibri, who cashed in stock shares and options worth more than $42 million last year, for “leveraging his critical relationships with key customers, Congress and other stakeholders.”

Among those members of Congress is Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 House Republican and the top Republican on the House subcommittee. Federal campaign records show that since 2018, 
Mr. El-Hibri and his wife have donated more than $150,000 to groups affiliated with Mr. Scalise. The company’s political action committee has given about $1.4 million over the past 10 years to members of both parties.

Mr. El-Hibri expressed contrition on Wednesday. “The cross-contamination incident is unacceptable,” he said, “period.”

Mr. Kramer’s estimate of 100 million doses on hold added 30 million to the number of Johnson &amp; Johnson doses that are effectively quarantined because of regulatory concerns about contamination. Federal officials had previously estimated that the equivalent of about 70 million doses — most of that destined for domestic use — could not be released, pending tests for purity.

**Executives from Emergent, which ruined millions of coronavirus vaccine doses, divulged to Congress the scope of the regulatory review of its troubled Baltimore plant.**

WASHINGTON — The chief executive of Emergent BioSolutions, whose Baltimore plant ruined millions of coronavirus vaccine doses, disclosed for the first time on Wednesday that more than 100 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine are now on hold as regulators check them for possible contamination.

In more than three hours of testimony before a House subcommittee, the chief executive, Robert G. Kramer, calmly acknowledged unsanitary conditions, including mold and peeling paint, at the Baltimore plant. He conceded that Johnson &amp; Johnson — not Emergent — had discovered contaminated doses, and he fended off aggressive questions from Democrats about his stock sales and hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses for top company executives.

Emergent’s Bayview Baltimore plant was forced to halt operations a month ago after contamination spoiled the equivalent of 15 million doses, but Mr. Kramer told lawmakers that he expected the facility to resume production “in a matter of days.” He said he took “very seriously” a report by federal regulators that revealed manufacturing deficiencies and accepted “full responsibility.”

“No one is more disappointed than we are that we had to suspend our 24/7 manufacturing of new vaccine,” Mr. Kramer told the panel, adding, “I apologize for the failure of our controls.”

Mr. Kramer’s appearance before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, which has opened a broad inquiry into his company, offered the public its first glimpse of the men who run Emergent, a politically connected federal contractor that dominates a niche market in biodefense preparedness, with the U.S. government as its prime customer.",,,1621470656,{},gyrjn8d,True,t3_nglu3z,False,False,t3_nglu3z,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nglu3z/contamination_woes_hold_back_100_million_vaccine/gyrjn8d/,1621554843,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Also, because of the low chance of experiencing severe covid symptoms in general, wouldn’t you need to wait for a much higher number of people to become infected?  Maybe like 1000 in each group to account for random chance?

Today, Fauci says he's comfortable being seen without a mask because he didn't want to send the wrong signal before the CDC announcement.  But the time he's talking about is after his March testimony, during the period where studies had come out saying that vaccines were protective but the CDC hadn't yet caught up with official guidance.

Published findings about this show that tests pick up fewer false negatives six, seven, and eight days after exposure than they do five days after exposure. If this recent study tested ONLY on the fifth day, then it’s possible it counted some people as negative who could have gone on to test positive two or three days later. 

[ A study that examined false-negative rates post-exposure, found that during the four days of infection prior to symptom onset, the probability of a false negative on the PCR test went from 100 percent on Day one to 67 percent on Day four. And even on the day individuals began showing symptoms, the false negative rate was still 38 percent, dropping to 20 percent three days after symptom onset. On average, symptoms of the virus develop five to six days post exposure, but the incubation period can be as long as 14 days.

&gt;While still their responsibility, having a unified national goal and direction in the face of a disease makes a big difference. Same as any other disease. Under the previous admin it was an inefficient patchwork.

So what has changed and been shifted to the national level?  Please be specifc as to what youre referring to.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It was signed. It did not meaningfully ramp up PPE. The admin largely ignored it, and when they did hand out contacts have much of the funding out to companies that had absolutely no resources to produce PPE.

It was not only signed but was being used since last March to get PPE and N95 mask.  What do you mean by ""meaningful""?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It was badly managed.

by who?  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Congress Investigates Inexperienced Companies Receiving Government Contracts  [https://www.npr.org/2020/07/15/891122225/congress-is-investigating-contracts-tied-to-mask-and-ppe-shortages](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/15/891122225/congress-is-investigating-contracts-tied-to-mask-and-ppe-shortages)

So, that was almost a year ago.  Was there any findings of illegal act or what?  Do you not have anything other than an investigation last year?  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The previous admin only cared to make efforts towards securing vaccines before the election. He made little to no efforts afterwards. 

you mean he reserved enough vaccines for the public well prior to the elections but youre trying to spin as something else?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When companies reached out to inquire about future orders so that the us would have a consistent supply he said no-

But under Operation warp speed Trump purchased 300 million doses of the vaccine to be delivered no later than July 2021 with the options for an additional 400 Million doses at a later date.  Youre just making stuff up at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\-the current admin had to scramble to fill the back order as well as use the DPA.

No they didnt.  The US reserved plenty of vaccines and the rights to more down the road.  Serioiulsy, stop lying .

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Do you?

Yes, see above.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Not for the entirety of the pandemic, no. 

Why would they need the entirity of the pandemic funded?  That makes absolutely no sense.  Or is this another attempt to spin a lie.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Didn't expand it, that backfilled funding.

And what is providing further funding once its identified as being needed.  What is it youre trying to argue at this point?  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-slow-down-testing-coronavirus-i-dont-kid/

So, during a time when the administration was ramping up testing to rates higher than any country youre claiming they were downplaying testing?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/us-coronavirus-data-has-already-disappeared-after-trump-administration-shifted-control-from-cdc-to-hhs.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/us-coronavirus-data-has-already-disappeared-after-trump-administration-shifted-control-from-cdc-to-hhs.html)

So, no data was swept under the rug.  Just the HHS took over collecting the data.

Do you really have nothing supporting your claim data was 'Swept under the rug""?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Which leaves workers in states with poor guidelines out in the dark. 

What states had poor guidelines?  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And they enforce them the same way OSHA works for everything else.

yeah, thats done at the state level.  So, what are you talking about?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I guess that was more Senate Rs, 

So, another lie.

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;who were holding up the second relief bill unless immunity from legal action was guaranteed to companies who did that. 

Why would you hold a company liable for you getting covid during a global pandeminc if you chose to return to work?  How would you even know if it was contracted at work or somewhere else when the entire world is in a pandemic.  That makes absolutely no sense.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Do you think leaving the WHO to be entirely dependent on Chinese funding going forward is a smart investment with regards to future pandemics, or a poor one?

I would prefer that money be spent ensuring the US and its citizens are safe guarded against such threats.  That obviously wasnt being done by the WHO since they knowingly withheld information regarding the pandemic at the behest of the Chinese government. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Honestly most of this could have been googled. I get maybe not paying attention to the news at the time, but don't white wash the history because you don't remember.

There are still some cases and plenty of non vaccinated people. How is this situation different?

It depends on a lot of stuff: the actual prevalence of virus particles available to form mutations, how much variation on the spike protein is actually possible before the virus is unable to infect people and reproduce effectively, etc. This is a possible problem (see e.g. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigenic\_escape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigenic_escape)), but it's not the case that escape mutations are inevitable and guaranteed.

Incidentally, even with your petri dish example, a sufficiently effective antibiotic or a sufficiently small colony of bacteria would just result in the bacteria dying off before enough are able to reproduce to form antibiotic-resistant mutations.

&gt;You need vaccinated people to be exposed for a vaccine resistant strain to be selected for, right?

Not at all. You also get selective pressure from immune responses to live infections. The immune system creates antibodies that recognize the spike protein in live infections, so mutations on the spike protein that more successfully evade the immune system resulting in a longer infection or reinfection would likely also make a vaccine based on the ancestor strain less effective.

The vaccines were donated or sold at “favorable prices,” Foreign Ministry official Wu Peng told reporters.  
  
Wu compared China’s outreach to the actions of “some countries that have said they have to wait for their own people to finish the vaccination before they could supply the vaccines to foreign countries,” in an apparent dig at the United States.  
  
“We believe that it is, of course, necessary to ensure that the Chinese people get vaccinated as soon as possible, but for other countries in need, we also try our best to provide vaccine help,” said Wu, who is director of the ministry’s Africa department.  
  
While the U.S. has been accused by some of hoarding vaccines, President Joe Biden on Monday pledged to share an additional 20 million vaccine doses in the coming six weeks, bringing the total U.S. commitment to 80 million. The Biden administration hasn’t said which countries will receive them.  
  
The doses will come from existing U.S. production of Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine stocks. The administration previously committed to share about 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine by the end of June.  
  
The U.N. Security Council called on Wednesday for accelerated availability of COVID-19 vaccines for Africa, expressing concern that the continent has only received about 2% of all vaccines administered globally.  
  
A presidential statement approved by all 15 members at a council meeting on African issues reiterated the need for “equitable access” to quality, affordable COVID-19 tests, treatments and vaccines.  
  
China’s vaccine diplomacy has been a surprising success: It has pledged roughly half a billion doses of its vaccines to more than 45 countries, according to an Associated Press tally.  
  
With just four of China’s many vaccine makers claiming they are able to produce at least 2.6 billion doses this year, a large part of the world’s population will end up inoculated not with the fancy Western vaccines boasting headline-grabbing efficacy rates, but with China’s humble, traditionally made shots.  
  
Egypt will start locally producing China’s Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine in June, with Sinovac enabling the Egyptian side to obtain the expertise and technical assistance to produce the vaccine, giving the license to manufacture and pack the vaccine in Egypt.  
  
“Aid alone cannot solve Africa’s vaccine issues. We must support local manufacturing of vaccines in Africa, even though this is difficult due to (low) levels of industrialization,” Wu said.",,,1621532954,{},gyujuxb,True,t3_nh6qfn,False,False,t3_nh6qfn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nh6qfn/china_says_providing_vaccines_to_almost_40/gyujuxb/,1621617971,24,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

**SARS-CoV-2 incidence and vaccine escape**

An Editorial1 earlier this year described the potential for the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants that render vaccines less effective (vaccine escape), assisted by waning immunity following vaccination. This raises a crucial question: how can COVID-19 exit strategies be planned while limiting the vaccine escape risk?

The Covid variant first detected in India is set to be the dominant strain in the UK within days, experts have said, with the government and health teams struggling to contain cases, which have risen by more than 75% since Thursday.  
But new data from the the Wellcome Sanger Institute’s Covid-19 genomic surveillance, which excludes samples from recent travellers and surge testing, has shown how rapidly and widely the variant appears to be embedding.

“Is there a reason they’re worried about the mutations for Covid?”


Existing vaccines work less well but well enough against existing varriants.  The concern is that new mutations could create new variants that our current vaccines can’t beat. 

 If that happens then new vaccines will be quickly created but everyone will need another shot and infection will spread/people will suffer until we are adequately protected.

This is the direction I've heard some countries like UK say they want to go for for 2,3rd generation if needed beyond the first intramuscular boosters that will shortly be evaluated. 

However, importantly it's been mentioned that only immunocompromised or immunosenecent, (older vulnerable people) really might need 3rd shot, let alone furthermore, so the 8bn number is likely to be an overshoot to what's necessary given what we know about longevity of and durability of humoral and esp cellular immunity with SARS 1 and 2 thus far (also we can consider data shows pregnant mothers pass vaccine antibodies to children)",,,1621527997,{},gyu7ygs,False,t3_nh2rtx,False,False,t1_gyu50k3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nh2rtx/vaccine_boosters_could_be_necessary_as_soon_as/gyu7ygs/,1621610498,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

If you have any food that you bought last year for Covid lockdown/emergencies/etc., now is the time to eat it or donate it to a food pantry. If it's expired, eat it or toss it instead of donating it please.  If you want to be prepared for future emergencies, go ahead and buy more to replace it, I guess.

If you're an American and you've been waiting for your turn to get vaccinated, it's your turn.

If you are vaccinated, it's your turn to help other people get vaccinated. 

If you have a strategy to get older Americans vaccinated, please spread the word. 

I think we need to get to the point where we can get hospitals back to normal operation and get family doctors/GP's doses to give out like they do with the flu vaccine. And like tons of extra doses. Novavax should help here.

The vaccines are FREE in the US.  FREE FREE, not like ""Copay free"", like fuckin FREE.  Go get one. Now.  Is there something stopping you from going to get one today? Talk to me about it, we'll get it worked out.

[Fewer symptoms = less spread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6sj6g/daily_discussion_thread_may_07_2021/gxbfbt1/)  Vaccines make you have fewer symptoms (*if* you get an infection after vaccination).

From the [NYT:](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/health/cdc-masks-vaccines-variants.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article) 
&gt;Introducing the new recommendations on Thursday, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the C.D.C. director, cited two recent scientific findings as significant factors: Few vaccinated people become infected with the virus, and transmission seems rarer still; and the vaccines appear to be effective against all known variants of the coronavirus. 

Remember, if you got infected, recovered, and then got at least one dose of Pfizer, you have immunity not only to multiple variants, but also SARS-CoV-1, the virus for which we named SARS in 2003.  Turns out much of [the ""breadth"" of that immunity is from the vaccine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/net65c/sarscov2_mrna_vaccines_induce_a_greater_array_of/)

Today's thinking:

US : 

Children don't seem spread the virus as effectively as adults. 

We have okay vaccination numbers and lots of natural immunity.

Adults spread the virus much more effectively than children. But that's good news. About half of the people above 11 are vaccinated, and many have natural immunity. 

So yes, children are vulnerable to infection, but they don't tend to be superspreaders. Most people who were going to get infected and cause spread have already done so, or have been vaccinated. Now, there are still tons of people who could be infected left. So, I need help with some math :

What is the additional value of vaccinating one additional older person vs a younger person? If you vaccinate a young person, you are only protecting that person. If you vaccinate an old person, you are probably preventing spread.",,,1621524750,{'gid_2': 1},gyu07tp,False,t3_ngtaqz,False,False,t3_ngtaqz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ngtaqz/daily_discussion_thread_may_20_2021/gyu07tp/,1621605608,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,

I haven’t got a link handy but that background may help in your searches of the literature.

Also as you may be aware, in some states a 16 year old is able to consent to vaccinations without parental consent. It varies wildly though.

Lastly, there are resources available online to help teens approach the matter with reluctant parents.

I hope your teenager is able to get vaccinated soon. Thank you for being a responsible parent.

Interval between mRNA doses

The second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible, but not earlier than recommended (i.e., 3 weeks [Pfizer-BioNTech] or 1 month [Moderna]). However, second doses administered within a grace period of 4 days earlier than the recommended date for the second dose are still considered valid. If it is not feasible to adhere to the recommended interval and a delay in vaccination is unavoidable, the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines may be administered up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. Currently, only limited data are available on efficacy of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered beyond this window.

However, even building factories abroad can be used to dodge US taxes.

Why? Because of flaws and perverse incentives in TCJA and GILTI, one of TCJA's main policies attempting to go after corporations that shift profits abroad.

Basically, one way multinational corps avoid US taxes is by parking high-value intangible assets (think patents) overseas, so the US does't tax them. GILTI attempted to address this by setting a minimum global tax on income earned from subsidiaries assets *in excess of the value of 10% of a subsidiary's foreign depreciable tangible property (think stuff like factories)*.

The hope was to target subsidiaries that had lots of valuable IP but no tangible assets -- e.g., if a subsidiary had been transferred lots of valuable IP that was providing income, they'd still get taxed, so hopefully they'd do it less. 

The problem is that this income is only taxed if the income is in excess of a certain percent of a firm's tangible property. Thus, one ways multinationals can avoid this tax is if they build tangible assets -- e.g. factories -- overseas. In this way, TCJA actually incentivizes some degree of off-shoring. 

Here's how one commentator [put it](https://www.cfr.org/blog/tax-reform-and-trade-balance):

&gt;The global minimum tax on intangible income (GITLI) should discourage tax shifting. Firms with no real assets abroad and big profits abroad in their offshore subsidiaries will have to pay 10 percent on their excess intangible profits (this makes the new tax system less than fully territorial). **But this also could have the perverse effect of encouraging firms to shift tangible assets to low tax jurisdictions abroad (even more pharmaceutical production in low tax jurisdictions?) to raise the firms’ tangible income in the low tax jurisdictions.** Remember tangible income offshore isn’t subject to the global minimum tax.

Another brief discussion about this is on pg. 15 of [this paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3084187).

One group is extremely entrenched in survival of the fittest (which is odd because of other correlation of beliefs) and another group that's reactions were extreme as a counter balance (also odd because of their correlation of beliefs).  

2. A lot and I mean a lot of these mental health issues were pre existing. Yeah it took a pandemic to push people but if you look at the market crashes the same data shows up. The countries that address mental illness have better outcomes. Social, economic, etc.. it's in the data. Also it helps they have ample Social Safety nets but that's a different topic. 

Obviously other factors are at play which amped up the issue. Which will be studied for 20 some years. 

In any event I know the USA will never get serious. However I hope COVID helps us seek both physical and emotional well being in a more proactive manner.

Those are things that can't be altered, and are more on the other person, especially in relation to the color of your skin.

A better analogy is behavior. If someone gets belligerent and angry at a bar, even if they mean no harm, that's going to make people around them feel unsafe, and it is absolutely not the responsibility of the other people in the room to get over it. As well, I also am a large man that has been known to make people uncomfortable with my size. I can't do anything about that, but my behavior typically puts people at ease pretty quickly.

To many people, seeing someone going maskless denotes that that person may be **behaving** in an unsafe manner that could feasibly pose a threat to them or someone close to them. Now, I understand that with vaccinations on the rise, and with the shift in CDC guidance, that is becoming more and more unlikely by the day, but it's been over a year of this, and the psychological habit is going to be hard to get out of for many people.

If someone has a problem with me or you because of the way we look? Fuck em. But if my behavior is what is making them feel unsafe? I'm more than willing to step back and re-evaluate whether my comfort is worth putting stress or anxiety onto someone else.

[],,Shaggyninja,,,[],,,,text,t2_749n9,False,False,[],"India set another coronavirus milestone this week. On Wednesday, authorities announced the country had recorded more than 4,500 deaths from covid-19 for the prior 24 hours, setting a world record.

That number of deaths — higher than the previous record of 4,400 set in the United States on Jan. 20 — comes as new cases appear to be declining in India, following days on end when new daily cases broke records in late April and early May, peaking at more than 414,000 on May 6.

As The Washington Post’s Joanna Slater reports from New Delhi, deaths from covid-19, the disease the virus causes, lag infections by several weeks. Despite the record number of deaths, there are some positive signs that India’s surge may be slowing, with less than 300,000 new daily cases this week. But there have been long-standing questions about the accuracy of the numbers recorded in India.

Even now, Slater writes, “in India’s vast hinterland, scores of people are dying with covid symptoms without being tested.” And amid this uncertainty, health experts on Wednesday debated among themselves what the rising number of recorded deaths actually meant.

In India, even with gross under-counting of deaths, the deadliest day for any country since the pandemic began 💔😢

— Madhu Pai, MD, PhD (@paimadhu) May 19, 2021 Chandrakant Lahariya argued that the surge in new covid-19 deaths may be influenced by aggressive new attempts to rectify problems with the reporting of deaths. Many states were still lagging, the New Delhi-based health policy expert wrote on Twitter, meaning that India’s covid-19 deaths may remain high for a while.

Even as new daily cases fall in coming weeks, “new daily deaths may stay at very similar and narrow high flat curve, for a few weeks, before getting into a downward trend,” Lahariya wrote.

Those deaths will add to a huge toll. As it stands now, there have been well over 25 million recorded cases of the coronavirus among India’s 1.4 billion population. The official death toll stands at more than 283,000.

Other countries are expressing new concern over the variant that is widespread in India. On Tuesday, British scientists said that the variant, known as B.1.617.2, could quickly become the dominant strain in the United Kingdom if it is allowed to spread.

In technical papers designed to advise the government this week, scientists said that B.1.617.2 could be up to 50 percent more transmissible than another variant that had spread through Britain late last year and caused a major winter surge there.

British authorities say that while the number of cases of B.1.617.2 found within its borders remains small, mostly concentrated in northwest England and in London, it is growing. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Parliament this week that confirmed cases had doubled in five days.

Sharon Peacock, director of the U.K.’s Covid-19 Genomics Consortium, told reporters that various measures, from travel bans to contact tracing, could buy some time. Even so, a fast-spreading variant such as B.1.617.2 would have “a biological passport for international travel and global spread” — meaning international spread was likely, perhaps inevitable.

That’s true already. In recent days, U.S. health experts have raised their concerns about the variant spreading here, while there have been documented cases in Germany, Singapore and elsewhere.

“It’s outcompeting the other viruses,” Jeremy Luban of the University of Massachusetts Medical School told NPR this week. “It’s replacing whatever variants were there before. And it’s always a concern when something like this changes because we don’t know what will happen.”

The World Health Organization this month labeled B.1.617, the lineage which includes B.1.617.2, a variant of global concern and suggested there were worrying signs that antibodies from vaccines or infections with other variants might not be quite as effective against this variant.

But vaccines remain the most potent weapon against this variant and others. On Wednesday, as India broke the daily death toll record, British officials said that they were confident the vaccines worked against the variant and that vaccinations would be at the center of the country’s fight against covid-19.

Britain must move to replace the “shield of restrictions with the sword of the vaccine program,” Hancock said at a briefing from 10 Downing Street, adding that there would be increased testing and surveillance in variant-hit areas, with new research into whether additional vaccine doses would boost protection.

In Britain, where one of the world’s fastest vaccine rollouts has pushed back a severe coronavirus outbreak, the spread of the variant has raised new doubts about the country’s plans for a full reopening in June. But it is in areas further back in the vaccination process where there are real worries.

Africa has accounted for a minuscule fraction of global vaccinations, for example. And India’s ongoing restrictions on vaccine exports have already created supply problems for Covax, the WHO-backed effort to share vaccines equitably, which announced this week it was short by more than 100 million doses.

On Tuesday, the Serum Institute of India — the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines by volume — made an announcement that suggested it was unlikely to resume vaccine exports “to Covax and other countries” before the end of the year.

— Agathe Demarais (@AgatheDemarais) May 18, 2021 Wealthy nations are finally taking some action, with France pledging to share 5 percent of its doses with Covax through the year and the United States promising to share an additional 20 million of its own doses beyond the 60 million already pledged. But as my colleague Emily Rauhala has explained, these donations “represent just a fraction of what experts say is need to end the pandemic.”

The high stakes for slow action have been made clear in India. Despite the country’s strong tradition of manufacturing vaccines, it has been sluggish in getting out doses domestically. This, combined with government complacency and the loosening of restrictions, allowed B.1.617.2 and related variants to spread — killing thousands of Indians each day and threatening the rest of the world.",,,1621514620,{},gytdtd8,False,t3_ngxl6g,False,False,t1_gyt9u78,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ngxl6g/as_india_set_records_for_covid19_deaths_b16172/gytdtd8/,1621592080,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,annoyedatlantan,,,[],,,,text,t2_f1901,False,False,[],"Yes, the key difference being that both the viral vector and mRNA vaccines trigger a much more powerful immune cascade because of the mechanism of action. Not to anthropomorphize the immune response too much, but the body believes the threat is much more serious and acute when your own cells are generating the foreign protein. 

It has been noted that T-cell counts are significantly higher for the mRNA and viral vector vaccines than the inactivated virus vaccines, even when the apparent short term efficacy is about the same (e.g., Sinopharm vs. Astrazeneca). The T-cell response is expected to result in more lasting efficacy as well as greater ability to deal with variants (although AZ has struggled with the South African variant). 

Combine that with the natural benefit of making the immune system target a very mutation resistant bit (the spike protein) as opposed to the whole virus and it is clear why the mRNA and viral vector based vaccines are so amazing. The protein subunit vaccines (e.g. Novavax) will at least have the same bit there and are noticeably more effective than the whole-inactivated virus ones. 

I really don't think people appreciate how amazing mRNA vaccines are (and to a lesser extent, viral vector-based vaccines, although I've never been a fan of the complex delivery mechanism). They are literally perfect. Incredibly easy to modify the coded proteins, intracellular response generating, and incredibly simple and direct delivery mechanism with no fuss like viral vector vaccines. 

While some viruses will inherently be resistant to vaccine creation, there needs to be an entirely separate approval pathway for mRNA vaccines going forward in emergency use scenarios. So long as it can be demonstrated that the coded protein will not trigger unexpected immune responses, they should be approved quickly. They are literally plug and play vaccines that - now that manufacturing capacity is there - can be coded overnight and then start being mass produced with a 45-60 day lead time.

I say without exaggeration that with the right regulatory framework and the now emergent mRNA manufacturing capacity, a COVID-like outbreak could be completely stopped early on. My greatest fear is a MERS-like fatality rate with COVID-like contagion. It will likely eventually happen. We need to be prepared, and emergency-use of mRNA vaccines are the key.",,,1621513715,{},gytc8d4,False,t3_ngvt94,False,False,t1_gytb3x7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ngvt94/some_vaccines_help_nations_exit_the_pandemic/gytc8d4/,1621591163,19,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The vaccine rollout could reach those in their early-20s in the first weeks of next month, The Telegraph understands, with hopes that all over-18s could be offered jabs in June.

The programme will move to those aged 30 and over next week, while extra supplies are being sent to areas worst hit by the Indian variant. 

Ministers have said that the Government is on track to meet its target to offer first doses to all adults by the end of July.

But NHS managers have begun drawing up plans which accelerate the timetable, amid concern about the spread of the Indian variant among young adults. 

From Thursday, the health service will offer jabs to those aged 34 and over, with the programme expected to reach those aged 30 and over next week. 

Meanwhile, surge testing and vaccinations are being sent to the areas worst hit by the Indian variant, in a bid to boost uptake among all those eligible, with Hounslow, Leicester, Kirklees and North Tyneside among areas now being targeted. 

The Government has resisted calls to allow widespread rollout of vaccines to younger people, insisting that its strategy of speeding up second doses to over 50s is more effective. 

However, many areas have found ways to target younger groups, with services in London, Bedford and Bolton among those offering jabs to multi-generational households. 

Internal plans drawn up by NHS managers suggest vaccines could be offered to all over-18s within five weeks - a month ahead of the Government target.

While the rollout of first doses slowed during April, a return to its previous pace could mean that the programme reaches those in their early 20s in the first or second week of June. 

Ministers have already accelerated plans for the administration of second doses, meaning all over 50s could be fully vaccinated by June 7.

Prof Stephen Powis, National NHS Medical Director said: “The success of the NHS Covid-19 vaccination programme, the biggest in history, is not by accident but down to careful planning and precision by NHS staff who have now delivered 48.5 million doses across England in less than six months.

“Getting the vaccine is the single most important step we can take to protect ourselves, our families and our communities against Covid-19, so when you’re called forward, book your appointment and join the tens of millions who have already been jabbed.”

The Health Secretary said the Government remained on track to hit its target to offer a vaccine to all adults by the end of July. 

Matt Hancock said: “Our vaccination programme – the fastest and most successful in NHS history – moves forward at pace with 34- and 35-year-olds now being invited for the jab. This is incredible news and means we remain on track to hit our target of offering a vaccine to all adults by the end of July.”

He also announced the start of trials, which could see booster jabs to defeat the Indian variant offered this autumn.

Almost 3,000 people will be recruited to NHS trials, to establish the effect of a third dose, in protecting against existing and new variants. 

The £19.3m clinical trial will test the Pfizer jab alongside those from AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax, Janssen (from Johnson &amp; Johnson), Valneva and CureVac.

Three of the vaccines will also be tested at a half dose, which scientists say they expect will be enough to provide an adequate immune response. 

Meanwhile, scientists on Wednesday said the Indian variant may not be as transmissible as first feared, amid increasing confidence about the ability of vaccines to counter it.

The US butchered their response. The only reason that now they're doing ok, is their vaccine manufacturing capacity, however the American population is much less willing to get vaccinated proportionally, seeing the recent stats of Canada catching up with first doses. 

Healthcare differences are also much different, travel patterns are different. It would be a nightmare to try and contact trace and America would unfortunately put Canada in a much worse position regarding the pandemic if we let every anti-vax, anti-masker through. 

People are forgetting this Pandemic is far from over. There's still a significant chance that a mutation will arise that escapes the current immunity attributed by vaccines, so when that happens (and a lot of experts think it will), then we'll need boosters rapidly, and there's a window there for another dangerous wave since everyone will be vulnerable to that strain. 

Hopefully the mutants remain still somewhat affected by the vaccine, and only mutate very little in terms of antigenic shift - that would be ideal. 

But with Covid rampaging in India and Brazil etc. it's the perfect grounds for mutants to emerg and take hold. 

Vaccine passports are the best way to ensure we don't have to lockdown again. 

Once we are close to herd immunity and a a variant emerges and spreads, we'll know it had to come from abroad as the only way it could get back to Canada would be through vaccinated travellers. It gives us a better window to take action. 

Keep the border closes to unvaccinated travellers until Covid is wiped out, or indefinitely.

Taipei, May 19 (CNA) Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) on Wednesday raised the COVID-19 alert to Level 3 nationwide after the country recorded over 100 locally-transmitted cases for the fifth consecutive day.

The alert is provisionally effective from today through May 28, the CECC said.

The nationwide alert comes after the CECC raised the COVID-19 alert for Taipei and New Taipei to Level 3 on Saturday, as the two northern cities struggled to contain a spiraling number of domestic infections.

Under the CECC's four-tier alert system, a Level 3 alert means people are now required to wear masks at all times when they leave their homes, indoor gatherings of more than five people are not allowed and outdoor gatherings are limited to 10 people.

A Level 3 alert stops short of a lockdown and goes into effect when more than three community clusters are confirmed in a week or over 10 domestic cases of unknown origin are reported in a single day.
Taiwan on Wednesday confirmed 275 new cases of COVID-19, with 267 classified as domestic infections.

The new infections on Wednesday brought the total number of cases in the country to 2,533, of which 1,226 cases are domestic infections reported since May 15, according to CECC data.

According to Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), the decision to raise the alert to Level 3 nationwide was made because although the spread started in Taipei and New Taipei, there are now domestic cases across the country.

It is important to synchronize the pandemic response and containment measures taken by all county and city governments to ensure a single standard is enforced around Taiwan, said Chen, who also heads the CECC.

Starting Thursday, a nationwide COIVD-19 virtual meeting will be held every morning. It will be presided over by Deputy Interior Minister Chen Tsung-yen (陳宗彥) and Vice Health Minister Shih Chung-liang (石崇良) and be attended by deputy mayoral and county magistrate level officials from all county and city governments.

The meeting aims to coordinate medical resources and examine the latest COVID-19 cases and updates, Chen Shih-chung said.

The CECC will also hold an extra news briefing following the daily CECC briefing to answer reporters' questions on false information circulating online concerning the coronavirus disease, he added.

According to COVID-19 Level 3 alert guidelines, places of business and public venues other than essential services, law enforcement, medical treatment and government offices, are advised to close.

However, for those that remain open, strict mask wearing and social distancing are required.

The main concern about getting the vaccine is not whether it’s safe for people with cancer, but about how effective it will be, especially in people with weakened immune systems. Some cancer treatments like chemotherapy (chemo), radiation, stem cell or bone marrow transplant, or immunotherapy can affect the immune system, which might make the vaccine less effective. People with certain types of cancers, like leukemias or lymphomas, can also have weakened immune systems which might make the vaccine less effective. 

The initial studies testing the COVID-19 vaccines did not include people getting treatment with drugs that suppress the immune system, like chemo, or people who have weakened immune systems for other reasons. This is because the studies needed to see first if the vaccines work in people with healthy immune systems. Because of this, it’s not yet clear how effective the vaccines might be in these groups of people.

Although we don’t have specific information yet on how effective the vaccines might be in people being treated for cancer, it’s possible that the vaccines might not be as effective in people with weakened immune systems as compared to people with healthy immune systems. Despite this, experts still recommend that most cancer patients get the vaccine because those with a fragile immune system are at risk for severe COVID-19 disease, so getting even some protection from the vaccine is better than not having any protection.",,,1621518719,{},gytm5pw,False,t3_neli8w,False,False,t1_gytknwk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/neli8w/many_experts_say_to_keep_masks_on_as_pushback_to/gytm5pw/,1621596949,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I got vaccinated for myself, so that I have a much much much lower chance of getting sick, because I do not like getting sick and I would wager that most if not all people do not like getting sick as well.

The new domestic cases included 157 in New Taipei City, 87 in Taipei, 17 in Taoyuan and eight in Yilan, Health Minister Chen Shih- chung (陳時中) said at a press conference.

Six of the cases occured in Changhua, five were in Keelung, with two each in Taichung and Kaohsiung, as well as one each in Hsinchu and Yunlin, said Chen, who also heads the CECC.

Sixty of the cases were linked to a cluster involving hostess teahouses in Taipei's Wanhua District, while another 84 cases had recently visited the Wanhua area, he said.

The CECC said 63 of the cases were of uncertain origin and that 28 were still under investigation.
The one death is a woman in her 70s working in Wanhua, who started showing suspected symptoms on May 15 but refused to seek medical treatment, the CECC said.

Family members of the woman then lost contact with her and later found her dead in her residence, where she lived alone, on May 17.

She was tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday, the CECC said.

The new imported cases consisted of six from the Philippines, one from Indonesia, one from the United States and one from South Africa, the CECC said.

The new infections on Thursday brought the total number of cases in the country to 2,825, of which 1,512 have been domestic infections reported since May 15, according to CECC data.

Those who are not vaccinated and not wearing masks are taking the risk, not me.

I have read what the CDC published, I no longer need to wear a mask. So I wont be wearing one unless I am in a CDC designated place where they recommend one.  The CDC nor any government agency (in the US) have requested people be verified with a vax card either.  Therefore, as a good citizen, like all of you in here, I am following the rules.

I will never patronage a business that requires proof of vaccination.  I am not going to be part of a system that punishes or excludes others. I am also not going to carry a mask around in my pocket just in case.  If I do not feel safe somewhere I will just not go.  I am not responsible for you anymore, I wore a mask, I got vaccinated, my civic duty has ended.

I will go to a business that doesn't require it and no matter how much we wish for solidarity, there is no solidarity in competition.  You say I have to have a vax card or I now have to wear a mask, I respect your decision, will not make a fuss and will just spend my money elsewhere.  Really simple and everyone is happy.


That all said the government is NOT going to require this, the suggestion and talk was dead on arrival, this is an empty article and empty stir up fake controversy headline.

***My anecdote...*** My state has lifted all mask mandates, but left it open for businesses to decide.  I went to my favorite once a week pizza place, the masked girl behind the counter said I needed to leave and come back with a mask, I said ok and told her I won't be back for pick up.  No fuss, no yelling, no being an asshole, just said ""ok, I won't be back for pick up, cancel the order"".

To be clear, I have ZERO issues with a place requiring anything at all, they can do what they want, but I always have the vote with my wallet for any reason as well.

I went to my second favorite place, which will now be my number one place. Vinny said he was glad to see me and missed me (lol).

As I was leaving I could see the owner, an older guy, get really agitated. I assume it because he just lost a customer and was just finding out why, but I suppose it could have been something else, maybe he called me an asshole.  When he eliminates his mask requirement on an *arbitrary time table* that he comes up with out of the blue with no new science to back it up, he'll know why he no longer has the same customer base.    Vax card requirements would be a bigger small business killer.

Maybe I'm the only one?  Nah, the couple coming to pick up an order after me didn't have masks on either. I am betting the mask requirement ended as soon as *they* left or soon after.

You either believe in science and follow the rules or you don't. I choose science and rule following, call me a maverick.

Just for the record, the sign on the door said ""masks STILL required"" with an underline (I didn't see that going in, not that it would have mattered) which means they were aware of the state rule change and decided to implement their own, which is FINE. I have to go by this place to get to Vinnies so it will be interesting to see if the sign is still up next week.

This feels like a punishment for parent of children with developmental delays or even just typical 2 year olds. If you have a toddler who refuses to wear a mask because they just don't understand, what do you do? Stop going to work? 

Childcare centers have remained open for the entire pandemic and have not required young children to wear masks. It's unreasonable and not developmentally appropriate. Especially when you consider that childcare centers are responsible for .05% of community spread. So the risk is incredibly low. The WHO reccomends children age 5 and up to wear masks. Which seems more reasonable to me. 

Being an early childhood educator is already an incredibly difficult job and the pandemic and made it even harder with so many additional regulations. I have agreed with the regulation until this. These teacher are going to be spending all day chasing toddlers around and putting masks back on. 

I know some people express that their child wears a mask just fine, but consider the range of typical development is pretty wide and young children with developmental delays and learning disabilities are only beginning to be evaluated and diagnosed at 2 and 3 years old. 

I have been pro mask the whole pandemic, I got vaccinated as soon as I was eligible, I order my groceries, I do not take my child anywhere that requires a mask because he won't wear it. It's not an opinion for him, he just doesn't understand. No amount of discipline is going to result in him developing and maturing faster. He has an IFSP and receives services in his childcare setting. So what happens when he won't wear a mask? Is he going to get sent home or kicked out? How do I work if my child can't go to childcare? How does he receive his speech, OT, and special education services if he can't be in school?

Here are top scientists who advised the FDA on the vaccines and a co-inventor of the technology of mRNA vaccines. 

&gt;An infectious disease specialist with Penn's Perelman School of Medicine and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Dr. Offit is a member of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee for the Food and Drug Administration.
“It’s reasonable to be concerned about the variants, because this virus continues to drift at some level,” Dr. Offit said. “We should worry when people who have been naturally infected or have completed the immunization series are nonetheless less hospitalized with one of these variants. This hasn’t happened yet.”

&gt;Dr. Weissman, who co-developed the technology that made the mRNA vaccines possible, is currently working on a multivalent vaccine to cover all current and future variants at the University of Pennsylvania.
“Nobody wants to be in a position where a variant is suddenly infecting everybody all over again,"" he said in a recent interview. ""We haven’t hit that point. So we’ve got time to do this right.”

Persons at risk of contracting or spreading a disease. A covered entity may disclose protected health information to a person who is at risk of contracting or spreading a disease or condition if other law authorizes the covered entity to notify such individuals as necessary to carry out public health interventions or investigations. ***For example, a covered health care provider may disclose protected health information as needed to notify a person that (s)he has been exposed to a communicable disease if the covered entity is legally authorized to do so to prevent or control the spread of the disease.

Workplace medical surveillance. A covered health care provider who provides a health care service to an individual at the request of the individual’s employer, or provides the service in the capacity of a member of the employer’s workforce, may disclose the individual’s protected health information to the employer for the purposes of workplace medical surveillance or the evaluation ***of work-related illness and injuries to the extent the employer needs that information to comply with OSHA,*** the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), or the requirements of State laws having a similar purpose. The information disclosed must be limited to the provider’s findings regarding such medical surveillance or work-related illness or injury. The covered health care provider must provide the individual with written notice that the information will be disclosed to his or her employer (or the notice may be posted at the worksite if that is where the service is provided).

1) We were, societally, always incredibly selfish and dismissive of immunocompromised people before. I'm not saying we should all having been wearing masks for forever, but basic things like hand washing, staying home from things when you're sick (and I especially mean optional things like restaurants and parties, etc,).  We, as a society, suck at it. We have abysmal sick leave policies in place, and punitive absentee policies in schools. We're a selfish society that puts me (and my germs) ahead of protecting others, and corporate money ahead of personal well-being.  


So if we could take away from this that we CAN protect others with just simple things, that would be a step forward for society.  And for RIGHT NOW that may mean masks in essential businesses and/or other accommodations such as for work and school because....

2) Covid is still brand spanking new.  It's highly transmissible.  While vaccine are working against variants, they are showing less efficacy (closer to 70% for the South African variant for example) and the airport cluster in Singapore is showing that even vaccinated people wearing masks and taking precautions are catching the Indian variant.  So we're not done yet, especially in areas where there isn't widespread vaccine coverage and low community spread.  And while regular people may only get mild-moderate symptoms, it can still be devastating for the immune compromised people who aren't gaining as much or in some cases any protection from the vaccines.   


And meantime we do not have good effective anti-virals. We have nothing to use prophylactically. It's not in the IVIG products yet.  The best we can do is after they test positive, give them monoclonals and hope for the best.  


And finally  


3) They are showing that covid is mutating rapidly in immunocompromised people. If we so callously disregard this population (by not taking any societal precautions while also not making accommodations for them), we are flirting with getting a variant that affects us all.   


So it's not ""vaccinated people have to wear masks everywhere forever!"" but rather ""immune compromised people also need to be able to work and go to school and get groceries and medications and medical care and how do we, as a society, make that safer for them to do"".

First publication: 18 elderly people who were vaccinated against Corona contracted the virus in a nursing home in Raanana - this was published today (Thursday) for the first time here in the news. One elderly woman died and three of the infected are hospitalized in critical condition. It is not yet known what the source of the infection is, and the virus is now being tested to see if it is the original strain or its variant.

A senior official in the ministry said that this was a worrying case because all those infected were vaccinated, especially if it turned out to be a variant that was not the original virus, or the British variant. The outbreak at the institution was discovered following a deterioration in the health condition of a resident of the institution who experienced difficulty breathing. After being hospitalized she was diagnosed with coronary heart disease. It is now being investigated whether one of the visitors to the nursing home infected the elderly.

The Ministry of Health said in a response: At a geriatric institution in Raanana, where residents who are hospitalized, more than 90 percent of whom are vaccinated in Corona, were found. Most patients are asymptomatic and in good condition. The Ministry of Health conducted an epidemiological investigation and sampling while working to isolate the verified and their contacts. The ministry is following up on the findings and is preparing to carry out further follow-up and sampling in order to locate and isolate additional verified persons if any are found, in order to prevent further infections.",,,1621542469,{},gyv6dqd,False,t3_nh9p2x,False,True,t3_nh9p2x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nh9p2x/israel_18_vaccinated_nursing_home_residents/gyv6dqd/,1621631868,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Cute zingers aside, there's degrees to this that make sense.

Examples:

My neighbors decide to have a fight and cuss/swear loudly, possibly with their little kid in the house? Not really something to fixate on.

Hikers littering on Mount Everest? Bad, but probably not something for me to fixate on.

Other examples:

People not paying taxes, which means my city can't afford basic public services? Something I should definitely spend energy on, as a concerned citizen.

People defrauding COVID relief funds? Something to focus on, absolutely.

CDC opening the door for people to openly lie about being vaccinated, and mingle both indoors and outdoors without wearing a mask? Something I can definitely ""spend energy on"".

The ""eyyyyy, don't worry brah, just live your life"" works fine, if we assume that other people aren't actively impacting others by being selfish and harmful.

With that said, I do agree: vaccines are hugely more impactful than the masks ever were. And I'm happy to stop wearing a mask, now that the science points in that direction.

Only way to make it un-dicey would be to get fully vaccinated to eliminate all of that worry.

I believe the main concern right now is those still in a group that can’t be vaccinated, which is kids. I will assume we will get data on how this new variant deals with children as we love our free will behavior even during a pandemic. Vacations and holidays will probably be the big superspreader events for kids as school is about to shutdown for the summer.

There is no distinguished data that will tell you if a child (or an adult) is hospitalized WITH Covid or FOR covid. If a child is hospitalized for a stomach problem and upon admittance is tested and tests positive for covid, they are counted as a covid hospitalized child. Even if they have no covid symptoms. When the data gets rolled up, that gets lost and when you look at overall severity in children due to covid...you really can't because it's skewed, in the article this particular hospital had inflated it by 40%. To no fault of their own, it's the state and CDCs fault in how it's reported.

Your question is similar in that we don't know if vaccinated people who test positive have any symptoms and we don't know how many vaccinated people are testing positive in the hospital, they may have zero symptoms but again are counted anyway and as far as I know there is no tracking if positive people have been vaccinated.

I at least justified how you moved the goal posts.  The fact that you couldn’t even explain how I moved the goal posts and made an ad hominem rebuttals shows you don’t have a strong perspective.


&gt;What in the world are you talking about?

Read the entire thread.  This started with me claiming we should hold government officials accountable if this policy is proven to be a complete disaster, and you thinking that somehow we can’t hold the politicians accountable this time, especially if time will tell that this is a disastrous policy recommendation by the CDC.  Situations change all of the time but you can always hold government officials responsible for bad decision making no matter what; this isn’t even a lose-lose situation where you’re going to have casualties either way, this is clearly a win-lose situation where the CDC’s recommendation will either be ok or a complete disaster.  You’re just making excuses to not hold officials accountable in the event this turns into a complete disaster.  There is no reason you’ve provided why this time is or should be different from any time in the past.

&gt;We can’t blame public education for everything wrong in the world.

No one is blaming education for everything wrong in the world.  But if public education decided it was best to stop teaching math because “you do know how time works” then we should be able to hold the public officials accountable for bad decision/policy making, especially after the fact where we can see how disastrous such policy has been.

I did a ton of research on this last night to argue against an anti-vaxxer who was trying to argue that no one should get the vaccine because COVID-19 will just mutate. This hasn't shown to be true with COVID-19 so far. Even the most negative results have shown that COVID-19 mutates only half as fast as the flu, and COVID-19 vaccines have not shown to have an issue relating to OAS.
