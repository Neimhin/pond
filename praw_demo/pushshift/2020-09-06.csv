[],,AuldStravonian,,,[],,,,text,t2_61zkqrne,False,False,[],"COVID-19 elicits the NF-kB driven immune response, and an over robust response causes the disease symptoms. Chronic, aberrant NF-kB activation also very often occurs in the absence of infection, due to a combination of genetic and environmental/lifestyle factors.

Environmental and lifestyle factors which predispose to excessive NF-kB activation include a pro-inflammatory 'western' diet, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, lack of immune challenge in infancy, abnormal gut microbiota, lack of vitamin D, exposure to environmental chemicals, and food and chemical allergies and hypersensitivity reactions.

Unlike westerners, Africans don't tick nearly as many boxes, but you might say the same for low income residents of other developing countries, such as India, which has had a high impact. I think that the low average age, low rates of obesity, more natural diet, sunlight exposure and exposure to pathogens and allergens in infancy which 'train' the immune system not to overreact are probably important factors, particularly the last one. That said, lack of testing and lack of reporting could well be even more significant factors.

People of African descent living in the west, and exposed to the same environmental and lifestyle factors which predispose to 'western diseases', are even more susceptible to obesity and to diseases associated with excessive NF-kB activation, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension etc, which are all risk factors for severe COVID-19.

Look, I grew up in very religious conservative area, the kind where churches say things like the bible says women shouldn't wear pants.

I read the bible for self defense and to try to figure out how they used it to justify so much evil.  And the answer was, resoundingly, to pick out lines out of context (and to focus on those parts where the disciples were building church doctrine, not the parts with Jesus), and so all  work memorizing and studying?  It didn't change a single damn person's beliefs.

If you disagree with me? No amount of reading the bible with you will change my mind.  And listening to you try to prove Jesus was a good conservative is not worth my time.

If you weren't sealioning, and were actually interested, I can recommend that you read the books with Jesus, concentrating on his actions and words, and also books about the lives of Jewish rabbis of that time period, to gain context for his words and actions.

&gt; # ""Effect of Calcifediol Treatment and best Available Therapy versus best Available Therapy on Intensive Care Unit Admission and Mortality Among Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19: A Pilot Randomized Clinical study""
&gt; 
&gt; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsbmb.2020.105751
&gt; 
&gt; ## Highlights
&gt; 
&gt; - The vitamin D endocrine system may have a variety of actions on cells and tissues involved in COVID-19 progression.
&gt; - Administration of calcifediol or 25-hydroxyvitamin D to hospitalized COVID-19 patients significantly reduced their need for Intensive Care United admission.
&gt; - Calcifediol seems to be able to reduce severity of the disease.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Abstract
&gt; 
&gt; ### Objective
&gt; 
&gt; The vitamin D endocrine system may have a variety of actions on cells and tissues involved in COVID-19 progression especially by decreasing the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Calcifediol can rapidly increase serum 25OHD concentration. We therefore evaluated the effect of calcifediol treatment, on Intensive Care Unit Admission and Mortality rate among Spanish patients hospitalized for COVID-19.
&gt; 
&gt; ### Design
&gt; 
&gt; parallel pilot randomized open label, double-masked clinical trial.
&gt; 
&gt; ### Setting
&gt; 
&gt; university hospital setting (Reina Sofia University Hospital, Córdoba Spain.)
&gt; 
&gt; ### Participants
&gt; 
&gt; 76 consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, clinical picture of acute respiratory infection, confirmed by a radiographic pattern of viral pneumonia and by a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR with CURB65 severity scale (recommending hospital admission in case of total score &gt; 1).
&gt; 
&gt; ### Procedures
&gt; 
&gt; All hospitalized patients received as best available therapy the same standard care, (per hospital protocol), of a combination of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg every 12 hours on the first day, and 200 mg every 12 hours for the following 5 days), azithromycin (500 mg orally for 5 days. Eligible patients were allocated at a 2 calcifediol:1 no calcifediol ratio through electronic randomization on the day of admission to take oral calcifediol (0.532 mg), or not. Patients in the calcifediol treatment group continued with oral calcifediol (0.266 mg) on day 3 and 7, and then weekly until discharge or ICU admission. Outcomes of effectiveness included rate of ICU admission and deaths.
&gt; 
&gt; ### Results
&gt; 
&gt; **Of 50 patients treated with calcifediol, one required admission to the ICU (2%), while of 26 untreated patients, 13 required admission (50%)** p value X2 Fischer test p &lt; 0.001. Univariate Risk Estimate Odds Ratio for ICU in patients with Calcifediol treatment versus without Calcifediol treatment: 0.02 (95%CI 0.002-0.17). Multivariate Risk Estimate Odds Ratio for ICU in patients with Calcifediol treatment vs Without Calcifediol treatment ICU (adjusting by Hypertension and T2DM): 0.03 (95%CI: 0.003-0.25). Of the patients treated with calcifediol, none died, and all were discharged, without complications. The 13 patients not treated with calcifediol, who were not admitted to the ICU, were discharged. Of the 13 patients admitted to the ICU, two died and the remaining 11 were discharged.
&gt; 
&gt; ### Conclusion
&gt; 
&gt; Our pilot study demonstrated that administration of a high dose of Calcifediol or 25-hydroxyvitamin D, a main metabolite of vitamin D endocrine system, significantly reduced the need for ICU treatment of patients requiring hospitalization due to proven COVID-19. Calcifediol seems to be able to reduce severity of the disease, but larger trials with groups properly matched will be required to show a definitive answer.
&gt;

TLDR: 

High dose Vitamin-D (21280IU) massively reduce the risk of needing ICU care (96%) and dying (infinite%) if admitted to hospital for Covid-19. calcifediol is about 3-5 times more powerful than the more common form of vitamin-D, [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6566727/)

Do you maybe mean IU ?

---




The dose response for different people is hugely variable (so there is not really a general RDI :/ ). You might need more than 10 000IU or less than 1000iu, so everyone really should get their blood levels tested. 40-60 ng/ml is a good target. 


https://grassrootshealth.net/document/vitamin-d-dose-response-curve/

Rhonda Patrick Phd recommends 4000IU as a good general dose. 

https://www.foundmyfitness.com/vitamin-d

Higher is probably also fine especially if your getting enough of the co-factors, k2, vitamin-a, magnesium etc. But please get your blood levels tested after a few months of this dose an calibrate according to your test results. 



https://vitamindwiki.com/Vitamin+D+Cofactors+in+a+nutshell


To my knowledge toxicity has only been reported in daily doses of &gt;30 000 IU over several months. 

https://www.grassrootshealth.net/document/vitamin-d-toxicity/


also 


RDI is to low due to a statistical error.

&gt;...

&gt; The role of vitamin D in innate and adaptive immunity is critical. A statistical error in the estimation of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D was recently discovered; in a correct analysis of the data used by the Institute of Medicine, it was found that 8895 IU/d was needed for 97.5% of individuals to achieve values ≥50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed that 6201 IU/d was needed to achieve 75 nmol/L and 9122 IU/d was needed to reach 100 nmol/L.

I think its something daft like a 1 in 100,000 chance with a flu virus, but thats really not much comfort  to me. It could have been genetic predisposition,  a run down immune system, high viral load or just shitty luck,  but my number was still up.

With covid, even if it is a 1 in 10k chance of developing lifelong conditions,  any reasonable society should pause because the economy can't take that many dropping out the workforce. That's not as sexy a headline  as ""but DEATH!!!!"", I admit, and it remains to be seen if covid results in a significant number of royally fucked immune systems,  but i would be relieved if more people erred on the side of caution.

If I had to guess, I think your main misunderstanding is that other animals can get viruses. So lets say the original virus was endemic to bats and then a pangoline interacted with an infected one. Now the pangoline has some of the virus in it but due to the different biological conditions the aspects of the virus most suitable to the new biology will survive. Then some goober decides to eat the infected pangoline. Now the virus is in another new biology. It just so happens that in this case the part that did adapt to human biology was fairly effective.

Limiting sugar and carbs does help - Keto’s how I lost all that weight - it also helped a lot with mental clarity. 

Of course, it’s a catch-22 because my depression right now just makes me want to eat cupcakes and ice cream. Then I get more depressed because of weight gain post-cupcake. Thank goodness I still had some Prozac from a prior prescription refill, it’s helping.

## Summary

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents one of the greatest infectious challenges to humanity in recent history. One of the striking features of infection is the heterogeneous clinical response with worse outcomes observed in older patients and those with underlying health conditions. To date the potential impact of previous infection history has been poorly investigated as a potential determinant of risk. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), a persistent herpesvirus infection whose prevalence increases with age, is a major modulator of immune function and several observations suggest that infection might act to influence clinical outcome following SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, CMV is associated with the acceleration of immune senescence and has been linked to a range of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. This review addresses mechanisms by which cytomegalovirus infection may act to worsen the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection, discusses how these potential links could be investigated, and assesses the potential significance of any findings that emerge.",,1599501607,{},g4cvwpc,True,t3_iocgi4,False,True,t3_iocgi4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iocgi4/the_ancient_and_the_new_is_there_an_interaction/g4cvwpc/,1599503437,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

My SO is an at risk individual, so I go out for generally everything. I don't mind, as long as it can prevent any sort of chance of him getting it, I'm more than willing. This also means we've been making our own meals to not expose ourselves to any sort of possibility. 

However, he had to come out one afternoon, and he asked if I wanted to simply try mcdonald's. Didn't have to, but I understood the sentiment of us both hungry from not eating that morning and not wanting to cook, so I agreed. 

I also cannot even begin to describe the feelings I had. I put gloves on and had my mask on, didn't speak unless needed like ""thank you"", and even with all precautions in place, I was in tears practically for the majority of it.

On at least 15 different meds over the last 20 years. Probably as many doctors and therapists. And honestly...what making progress comes down to is getting over being pissed off that what your doing isn’t working and being willing to TRY SOMETHING NEW. 

You said yourself that medication isn’t doing it for you anymore. Well, then it’s time to take the little bit of help the meds give you and start TRYING SOMETHING NEW. Be willing to accept that maybe some “bullshit” isn’t the fucking hippy crap that you’ve always told yourself it is. Maybe drinking more water WILL actually make me feel better. Maybe getting in shape and not being uncomfortable ALL THE TIME will help me feel better. Maybe I CAN change the fucked up thought patterns that I’ve addicted myself to over the years. 

Self care is complicated. And requires you to learn about yourself. A doctor doesn’t know fuck all about you. You spend more time with your waiter at a restaurant than you do a doctor. They make best guess based on a situation. But it’s your personal responsibility to learn as much about yourself and your situation as possible. It’s the only way to begin to learn what is REALLY going on. And THAT is where mindfulness and all the other “bullshit” comes in. It’s hard. And takes A LOT of time and a level of self honesty that most people choose not to allow themselves to get to. 

But it WORKS. And so do most other alternative treatments. There’s a damn good reason that this stuff has been around for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. People don’t keep doing things that doesn’t have some sort of tangible benefit for them. And hell man, even if it is all bullshit. And you really are just “tricking yourself”’into being happy. If it ends with you being happy....are you seriously going to not allow yourself to enjoy it because it isn’t “real”? 

Meds and doctors are tools. But you need a lot more than two tools for a complicated job. And we are ALL such mental disasters that you need every tool to even have a hope of getting the job done.

Masks work by keeping the virus in, not out. 

You will not get any kind of study that included testing with masks and without masks then exposing all participants to the virus. It would be massively unethical. What you do have are dozens of published studies that looked at vapor droplets by size which show masks are effective at filtering coronavirus bodies, studies that examined countries with populations who abided by mask mandates (comparing infection rates) and studies that covered infection rate increases with low or no mask adherence. All studies show masks are significant indicators in controlling the spread of the coronavirus.

It SEEMED, in general, like you were questioning the idea that masks were ineffective. Many say that there is ""no proof to this"" and this position is ""anti-science"" and that their position that masks are effective is the ""science"" opinion, backed by proof.

&gt;The first study says that mechanistic studies show that they should work

""Potentially"" is a very important word.

&gt;Although mechanistic studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza

&gt;So, your two sources aren’t particularly germane and contradict each other.

I agree that one is the flu, but it is anaccurate to say they contradict each other.

And you seem to neglect the study that is specifically Covid.

&gt;Maybe google up some more. You might get lucky this time.

Why should I need more than one?  But ok ..

&gt;What is clear, however, is that universal masking alone is not a panacea. A mask will not protect providers caring for a patient with active Covid-19 if it’s not accompanied by meticulous hand hygiene, eye protection, gloves, and a gown. A mask alone will not prevent health care workers with early Covid-19 from contaminating their hands and spreading the virus to patients and colleagues. Focusing on universal masking alone may, paradoxically, lead to more transmission of Covid-19 if it diverts attention from implementing more fundamental infection-control measures.

https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-1342

&gt; Neither surgical nor cotton masks effectively filtered SARS–CoV-2 during coughs by infected patients. Prior evidence that surgical masks effectively filtered influenza virus (1) informed recommendations that patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear face masks to prevent transmission (2). However, the size and concentrations of SARS–CoV-2 in aerosols generated during coughing are unknown. Oberg and Brousseau (3) demonstrated that surgical masks did not exhibit adequate filter performance against aerosols measuring 0.9, 2.0, and 3.1 μm in diameter.

The situation right now is basically ""We have no proof that masks are so effective, but they probably dont hurt. So lets do it.""

&gt;Things aren’t proven true in a fundamental sense in science. There is lots of evidence that masks work.

Then I would *love* you to show me some of this evidence.

The larger problem is not the politics of either party (although GOP politics are very problematic). The problem is the way America's politicians shift the responsibility of solving problems. Instead of being decisive, they pass the responsibility down through the multiple levels of government so they can avoid scrutiny. When constituents are frustrated by this, politicians simply demonize the opposite party. This slows down democracy and increases the divide between the parties. 

Just look at the US coronavirus response if you want an example. The US wasted months when the federal government left lockdowns, mask requirements, and PPE procurement to the states.

You don't understand probability. A nation of 5 million individuals on a literal island has domestic transmission again.

I found it jarring and harrowing tbh. I do not consider myself to be a hero and healthcare workers who call themselves heroes are just self-centered idiots with big boasting heads. Overnight, I became something really special to society all of a sudden. RNs are very much side characters when the public pays attention to healthcare (see TV shows like Grey’s Anatomy) but all of a sudden we were the only thing preventing the world from imploding. Recently, the disinformation campaign has reached full speed. Now I got people around me asking why we need to wear masks, that they don’t “actually” work, that masks lower your oxygen levels, etc. Never has the difficulty and stress related to my job been in the hands of the public to such a degree. Do these people not know that physicians and RNs wear them for several hours on end in the operating room? And let’s not even get started on the crazy things going on besides COVID like the election coming up or the rapid and dangerous political polarization occurring in the US. Anyways, sorry for the long post I don’t even know how I feel really. I guess I feel frustrated and burnt out at how people virtue signal with their words but do nothing to actually bring or affect real support. I hated the extra attention at the beginning because it felt disingenuous but now I hate everyone’s return to indifference too. My mind and body are on autopilot and I’m just watching the days of my life pass like a movie. It’s been like this for a while. I am alive and want to continue being alive but how can I *feel* alive? I want to be alive again...

But that just isn't possible. How could they possibly hide an outbreak from the leadership, if it isn't contained as fast as possible straight away it's pretty obvious what's going to happen. Common sense surely tells you that unless the contact tracing goes into effect within no time you've got an outbreak that is just impossible to hide. Once the contact tracing goes into effect everyone knows.

No, I'm not American. I'm English. But again your statistics argument just doesn't stand up. China has been clear of the virus before and then they've had new outbreaks, as they probably will again according to statistics. That doesn't mean they can't control them again. The same as it means new Zealand won't get it under control again. Yes, statistically they are likely to have more infections, it doesn't mean they have right now.

I'm pretty sure i stated China has terrible press freedoms, if there is one thing i wish for them it is to have a more free press, far more important for them than democracy. Although obviously i wouldn't wish American press on any country. But my point still stands, the internet is not as tightly controlled as you think, information still flows. It may get taken down but once the news is out there, but there is no stopping it. I'm sure you personally have seen lots of news from China that they wish they could have suppressed, but i guess that didn't work did it.

But thats the problem with your argument, because that is exactly what they would be if the cases were to go unreported. 

Using other places that have also been clear of the virus and now have new cases isn't much of an argument. China has also been clear before and then had new cases, it's kind of inevitable.

&gt; The polio outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a case in which a strain of virus that was rendered safe for vaccinating most people has regained some of its disease-causing abilities through genetic mutation. That’s sort of similar to why bugs that are more common problems in developed countries, like staphylococcus and gonorrhea, stop responding to antibiotics: They acquire genetic mutations that make them resistant to certain drugs. What is most important here is to consider the level of risk associated with vaccine-linked outbreaks, or cases of paralysis, compared to the effects of polio in an unvaccinated population. While the attenuated poliovirus in the vaccine itself may lead to no more than four or five cases of paralysis among every million individuals vaccinated, there would likely be thousands of cases of serious disease among a million exposed, unvaccinated people.

""In an emergency, such as a pandemic, the need for flexibility and speed often entails shifting legislative power from the parliament to the government. RF Chapter 8 contains a relatively detailed list of areas of law the regulation of which generally requires a statute. In principle, any public law norms entailing obligations for natural or legal persons vis a vis the state must also be in statute form (RF 8:2 p.2), as must the rules concerning the basic structure and competence of local authorities (RF 8:5). However, in both these areas, RF 8:7 provides that the parliament may, by statute, delegate power to the government to issue ordinances (förordningar). Moreover, parliament may authorize the government to sub-delegate this power to administrative agencies or local authorities (RF 8:10). Under RF 8:7 and 8:11, the government also has an independent power to issue ordinances in areas not specifically reserved for statutes and may sub-delegate this power to administrative agencies. Usually, one tries to avoid passing laws quickly, in order to leave time for consultation with a variety of public bodies and civil society. Draft laws are also submitted to the Council on Legislation that consists of judges temporarily seconded from the Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court. The Council checks the constitutionality of the proposal and performs a quality control function on it.

Acts of parliament are generally necessary to limit constitutional rights. The rights most directly relevant during the Corona-crisis are the freedoms of assembly (RF 2:1, p. 3) demonstration (RF 2:1 p. 4), movement (RF 2:8), the protection against arbitrary detention (RF 2:6) and the right to protection of private property (RF 2:15). These are all relative rights which can be limited by statute. Restrictions must be necessary and proportional. For some rights, limitations may only be made for specific purposes, for example to combat an epidemic (RF 2:24).""

LAS VEGAS (AP) — The UFC is staging a fight show with just seven bouts after a series of cancellations related to positive COVID-19 tests.

The mixed martial arts promotion held its shortest card since 2005 on Saturday night after canceling two bouts at late notice.

Heavyweight Marcos Rogério De Lima's bout against Alexander Romanov was scrapped about 90 minutes before the first fight at the UFC Apex gym on the promotion's corporate campus in Las Vegas. The UFC also canceled a bout between lightweights Thiago Moisés and Jalin Turner.

In a third move, Kevin Natividad was removed from his featherweight bout against Brian Kelleher “as a precaution,” according to a UFC statement. Kelleher instead fought Ray Rodriguez on short notice.

De Lima and Moisés are Brazilian teammates at American Top Team. Brazilian media reported that both fighters tested positive for COVID-19.

The UFC returned to action May 9 after an eight-week pause for the coronavirus pandemic. The promotion has held near-weekly cards ever since, and it had incurred only sporadic cancellations due to COVID-19 problems while stringently testing its athletes.

But at least one bout has been scrapped on fight night from each of the UFC's past three cards due to COVID-19 problems.

Saturday's troubled card had already lost two matchups before the cancellations on fight night.

Sijara Eubanks was scheduled to fight Karol Rosa, who was pulled from the card Thursday due to medical complications from her weight cut. Rosa was a late replacement for Macy Chiasson, who also pulled out of the bout for medical reasons.

Eubanks will meet a third opponent, Julia Avila, next week in Las Vegas.

Another bout scheduled for Saturday night between bantamweights Kelleher and Ricky Simón was canceled last week after one of Simón's cornermen tested positive for COVID-19, according to Simón.

Heavyweight veteran Alexander Overeem was scheduled to meet Augusto Sakai in the main event Saturday night.",,1599449503,{},g4aqieu,False,t3_inf4r8,False,True,t3_inf4r8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/inf4r8/covid19_tests_reduce_ufc_show_to_7_bouts_in_las/g4aqieu/,1599449513,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

To believe that in a country of 1.4 billion people that there is 0 local transmission is naive, verging on lunacy. Just like in Iran, there will be reports on the true number of cases in Vietnam and China in the future.

The symptoms that you get from infliuenza are due mostly to your body's response to fighting off the virus.  The vaccination can produce similar reactions due to kicking off your immune system, but the severity is much less.

When I get a flu shot I feel like kinda ass for 24 hours and tired and achey and like I've got a 99F fever.  An annoying ""feels like I might be coming down with something"" kind of feeling.  The kind of thing that I can power through but its easier to just have a down day. 24-48 hours later I feel fine.

When I was lazy about getting flu shots and I got influenza a couple years ago I ran a 103F fever for 3 days straight, I seriously considered checking myself into the ER, and I was wiped out for 3-4 weeks before I felt fully recovered.  Actual influenza kicks your ass way more than any vaccination malaise.

The reactions to the eventual COVID vaccine may be fairly severe by vaccination standards and people may wind up feeling  ill for ~24-48 hours (we'll have to see which ones actually get approved, but some of them seem to knock you out a bit).  The thing is that you won't wind up dying on a ventilator from the COVID vaccine.

This is all normal though.  The vaccination kicks off an immune response.  The immune response doesn't feel good (varies though between different people).

https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/in-demand-careers

You should also see what resources your county and state offer. Google a phrase like ""[my county my state] employment resources"" and see what comes back. I live in a very affluent county, and their job search and counseling resources are excellent. Your county should offer something similar, So check that out.

If you are willing to relocate, it certainly seems that all of the various medical technician and assistant positions as well as registered nurses are in high demand right now. Each one of those jobs will require training and certification however, so you need to familiarize yourself with the reputable programs that would train you for a job like that to include robust placement assistance. those are your hard-earned dollars you would pay for training, so you want to make sure you put them towards a full cycle program that has a proven track record over time of finding placement for their graduates.

I also highly recommend that you go to a site like USAJobs.com and look at the types of jobs the federal government is hiring for in your area and what those job qualifications are. You could also dig into your county and state job openings as well to get a sense of what they are hiring for. you then just have to decide what type of training or education you would need to go that route.

Finally, reach out to your US Congress person. Ask to speak with their constituent liaison staff member and explain that you are looking for resources and assistance in finding a career path. You'd be surprised. your representative is going to have an office somewhere within your district, and so I also highly recommend showing up in person as that always makes an impression.",,1599518959,{},g4dxhwu,False,t3_iobzh3,False,False,t1_g4dot9g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iobzh3/school_that_boris_johnson_visited_to_show_was/g4dxhwu/,1599522312,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

[],,say592,,,[],,,,text,t2_bwj99,False,False,[],"Yeah, I don't get that impression either, but it might be worth trying. The poster might have an ally in their roommate's fiance (sounds like they all live together) as he already has some reservations about the wedding. Maybe he can help her understand the need to compromise. Ideally someone could go and stay in a hotel or Airbnb for a week, give the virus time to incubate, she get tested, then they could live life like normal. I know not everyone has $700 sitting around to do that, and it really should be on her to pay for it, not the poster, but on the flip side if the poster is high risk it just not comfortable, it might be worth it. Of course the poster should be certain that she will actually get tested, otherwise don't waste the money. 

Daily temperature checks is still probably the easiest compromise. Pre-symptomatic people tend to exhibit a fever before any other symptoms and fairly early on in their ability to spread the infection, so it's a good tool. Asymptomatic people by definition don't register a fever, but may still show an elevated temperature, so with a good baseline you should still see that. Thankfully asymptomatic people have a lower viral load and are far less likely to spread the virus, though they definitely can. What I'm getting at is if they take some good precautions with additional hygiene and wearing a mask for a couple weeks, along with temperature checks, they should be pretty safe (no guarantees!). If the roommate does get COVID-19, hopefully someone can leave before it's at the highest state of contagiousness, or if they are asymptomatic the poster will have taken enough precautions to minimize the risk of getting exposed.

Oh, and if they can't get the roommate to cooperate, they should see if the fiance will. If the roommate is sick, the fiance will be as well (especially if he attends the wedding too). He may be more willing to do the temp checks or get tested a week or two later.",,1599454956,{},g4axv9o,False,t3_inl808,False,True,t1_g4au0tp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/inl808/1_wedding_275_guests_0_masks_56_covid_cases_in_9/g4axv9o/,1599454967,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

There is a consensus that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated naturally from Bat coronaviruses (CoVs), in particular RaTG13. However, the SARS-CoV-2 host tropism/adaptation pattern has significant discrepancies compared to other CoVs, raising questions concerning the proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2. The flat and non-sunken surface of the sialic acid-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein) conflicts with the general adaptation and survival pattern observed for all other CoVs. Unlike RaTG13, SARS-CoV-2 recombination presumably occurred between the S1/S2 domains of S protein enabling host furin protease utilization. Although millions of recorded cases have been recorded globally, SARS-CoV-2 S protein does not have any apparent further recombination, placing it in conflict with the recombination models of other CoVs. Similarly, the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 has not accumulated high-frequency non-synonymous substitutions, differentiating SARS-CoV-2 from other CoVs that have positive selection/adaptation mutations in their RBDs.",,1599452886,{},g4av65o,True,t3_inyga9,False,True,t3_inyga9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/inyga9/questions_concerning_the_proximal_origin_of/g4av65o/,1599452897,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Now a better solution to just masks / swimming goggles alone - perhaps a fully sealed head cover, or better yet, fully encapsulated air tight suit.

That's simply not how mask wearing works. If you're getting ""low viral load"" even when wearing masks, you're thinking wrongly. As *everyone* ought to know but now, **COVID-19 causes severe heart damage, permanent lung damage, and even long-term neurological issues** (hmm, maybe that explains the extreme idiocy of those dim-witted ""COVID skeptics""), even in seemingly low-level or asymptomatic exposures. Therefore, it doesn't matter *how much* virus is in somebody's system; we need to avoid getting the virus at *all costs*. Even just one viral particle can be deadly!

This also means that some ""negative"" COVID tests are going to be false, in situations where the virus exists in the system of the person being tested, but not in sufficient quantity to affect the test. But these people are no safer than those who test positive. **We are** ***undercounting*** **cases and deaths, not** ***overcounting***, **like some of the aforementioned ""skeptics"" have** ***postulated***.

The point of wearing masks isn't for the population to gain ""herd immunity"" (which, as we all know, is *mythical*) through lower amounts of exposure and not risk the symptoms, but to reduce the chances of each member of catching the virus!

Yeah *sure*, masks might not be 100% effective, and I'm not overzealous enough to deny *that*, but that's no excuse for not wearing one either, which is why they are simply considered *one* of the mitigation strategies against the disease.

In the beginning of the pandemic there were no national stockpile of personal protective equipment both here and almost everywhere except in Finland.

So when they got pandemic to Finland they just opened up their stockpile and had enough to go around.

The masks are tested against standards for PPE and are marked accordingly. I can't just at the moment remember the correct standards to tell you what to look for.

I hope that more people will be using masks during the coming months to stop the spread of infectious SARS-COV-2-virus, so that people won't get sick with covid-19 and later die from covid-19. I hope that all efforts that aren't going towards creating vaccines are searching for therapeutics.

Since the coronavirus pandemic started, public health officials in the United States have faced harassment and death threats, and some have even been [driven from office](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/coronavirus-health-officials.html). Now a university deeply involved in studying the virus has warned hundreds of its researchers to be on the lookout for dangerous packages.

Last Monday, the University of Washington, based in Seattle, sent an email to about 500 of its researchers telling them to be wary of suspicious packages and saying that virus researchers elsewhere had been targeted.

“We have received unfortunate reports from our contacts at the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) that threatening mail has been sent to COVID-19 researchers on the east coast of the United States,” said the email, which was first reported by [BuzzFeed News on Saturday](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kenbensinger/suspicious-package-covid-19-researchers-fbi).

The BuzzFeed News article quoted an F.B.I. spokesman saying that the bureau, “along with our local law enforcement partners, responded to a suspicious package sent to a few university researchers” and that “preliminary testing has indicated there is no threat to public safety in connection with this mailing.”

A University of Washington spokeswoman, Susan Gregg, provided a copy of the university’s email to The New York Times and said no suspicious packages had been reported so far.

The email warned researchers to be on the lookout for signs of suspicious mail, including an address with misspelled words, no return address, oily stains, discoloration or a strange odor. Any mail that raised concerns, the email said, should be left unopened and reported to the police by calling 911.

Research at the University of Washington includes [16 clinical studies related to the virus](https://www.iths.org/iths-covid-19-research-resources/current-covid-19-research/) and a prominent but sometimes criticized forecasting model. The model estimated last week that Covid-19 would kill about 410,000 people in the United States by the end of the year, more than double the current death toll, [drawing skepticism from experts](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1301738951078629376) who said predictions about the course of the pandemic months into the future are too uncertain to be useful.

The report of threats to researchers follows earlier signs of the risks faced by public health officials and others involved in the pandemic response. Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of President Trump’s virus task force and the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases, [received additional security in April](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/us/politics/coronavirus-fauci-security.html) after threats, and he said the security was also [expanded to his daughters](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/05/dr-fauci-says-his-daughters-need-security-as-family-continues-to-get-death-threats.html).

There are some conflicting stories around it, but the general consensus is that a lad who went on holiday, I think Greece way, came back infected. He then spread that among a football team, who then all went out on the lash in and around Sunderland. Pubs and clubs have had no choice but to close, at least 30 people tested positive as a result with many others waiting on test results, and school children/teachers have also tested positive at the same time which seems to be connected; and the lad at the centre of it has received death threats among other things. Whether or not the lad was waiting on a test result and went out regardless, I don't know, but you'll know that in English pubs a lot of old fellas and ladies like a pint and so there will have been some at risk people in those pubs at the same time the football team went in.

Sunderland is probably in need of a local lock down, and even then the horse has probably bolted in that a lot of people have been going here, there and everywhere not realising they were infected or in close proximity to people infected, indoors and for a decent amount of time.

It has spread like wildfire in a very short space of time as a result of one person who picked it up abroad.

All hospitalised patients received as best available therapy the same standard care, (per hospital protocol), of a combination of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg every 12 hours on the first day, and 200 mg every 12 hours for the following 5 days), azithromycin (500 mg orally for 5 days. Eligible patients were allocated at a 2 calcifediol:1 no calcifediol ratio through electronic randomisation on the day of admission to take oral calcifediol (0.532 mg), or not. Patients in the calcifediol treatment group continued with oral calcifediol (0.266 mg) on day 3 and 7, and then weekly until discharge or ICU admission. Outcomes of effectiveness included rate of ICU admission and deaths.

Results

Of 50 patients treated with calcifediol, one required admission to the ICU (2%), while of 26 untreated patients, 13 required admission (50%) p value X2 Fischer test p &lt; 0.001. Univariate Risk Estimate Odds Ratio for ICU in patients with Calcifediol treatment versus without Calcifediol treatment: 0.02 (95%CI 0.002-0.17). Multivariate Risk Estimate Odds Ratio for ICU in patients with Calcifediol treatment vs Without Calcifediol treatment ICU (adjusting by Hypertension and T2DM): 0.03 (95%CI: 0.003-0.25). Of the patients treated with calcifediol, none died, and all were discharged, without complications. The 13 patients not treated with calcifediol, who were not admitted to the ICU, were discharged. Of the 13 patients admitted to the ICU, two died and the remaining 11 were discharged.

\---

All patients received standard care. Thus, it is not known if calcifediol would be effective on its own. And calcifediol is a [medical drug](https://www.drugs.com/mtm/calcifediol.html) used to treat parathyroid problems, so it is unclear if normal vitamin D supplementation would achieve the same effect.

The researchers also did not measure the vitamin D3 levels of the patients, but they were probably deficient based on [prior population data](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32603576/). Still, it remains uncertain if vitamin D3 levels would affect the efficacy of calcifediol treatment for Covid-19. And other possible confounders in this study that the researchers did not measure are [obesity](https://medium.com/microbial-instincts/fitness-and-covid-19-severity-a-dose-related-response-5c8e765d3cb5), [ethnicity](https://medium.com/microbial-instincts/ace2-variants-another-reason-for-sex-and-ethnic-disparities-in-covid-19-27ad215fd014), and [socioeconomic status](https://medium.com/microbial-instincts/age-isnt-the-full-picture-in-covid-19-death-risks-population-study-finds-93a3f15826df).",,1599468856,{},g4bcr9k,False,t3_io1tl9,False,True,t3_io1tl9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/io1tl9/new_study_vitamin_d_reduces_risk_of_icu_admission/g4bcr9k/,1599468866,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Not understanding the long term effects is why we should be careful about things like sending our kids back to school. I am no way advocating for locking down for years, just until get a vaccine. That's it.

And you cannot say that you can understand the long term effects while still in the short term. That can literally only come with time. Anything else is conjecture and hypothesising.

Absolutely agree - and, what's striking in this case is that excluding just two trials from this meta-analysis (on Mongolian schoolchildren and toddlers in Afghanistan) markedly improves I^2 (ie, pooled estimate heterogeneity) and pulls the RR on to the null:

&gt;When there is highly significant heterogeneity, researchers should explore causes for the heterogeneity. Of the included studies, Camargo et al. [3] and Manaseki et al.

However, the former was carried out with Mongolian schoolchildren and the latter with 1-36 months old children in Afghanistan. If those two trials are removed from the meta-analysis in a sensitivity analysis, the evidence of heterogeneity decreases substantially (from P=0.001 to P=0.04) and the evidence of benefit from vitamin D vanishes to RR=0.95 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.00; P = 0.07; based on 4157 infections among 10202 participants in the remaining 22 trials).

**During the first week, 8,000 people were tested - with only two positive test results as a result.**

Mass testing of ongoing covid-19 infection is the largest to date in Sweden. The first test round was started last week, when just over 8,000 test answers from both students and teachers were submitted.

\- There are extremely few who are positive. Of more than 8,000 samples, we have only found two with active covid-19, and that is unexpectedly small. The majority are in the age group 20–30 and there we had expected a greater spread of infection, says Anders Johansson, researcher in infectious diseases at [Umeå](https://www.aftonbladet.se/lokala-nyheter/umea) University and project manager for mass testing.

During the second sampling week, the hope is that everyone who took the test last week will do it again. At the same time, more people are encouraged to participate in the survey.

\- The idea is to study what the spread of infection looked like at the start and what happened after a week on campus. Therefore, this survey is a bit unique. But considering how few have tested positive, it seems incredible that there has been any major increase now, says Johansson.

## Physical education

During the coming week, there is an opportunity for students and staff to pick up and submit samples. The goal is to offer up to 20,000 tests.

The purpose of mass testing is to find out whether regular teaching at university increases the spread of infection. According to Anders Johansson, Umeå University has chosen to conduct more physical education than many other higher education institutions around the country did at the start of the autumn semester.

\- We think that it has negative consequences when you do not meet students and teachers. But if a situation arises with increased spread of infection, the management is of course prepared to discuss measures and make decisions accordingly, such as possible teaching in small groups and an increased share of digital teaching.

## Teachers worried

Mass testing is also a way of dealing with the concerns that parts of the teaching staff have known before the start of the semester, Johansson states.

\- Of course, quite a few have expressed concern and thoughts. This is also why the testing is good - to create a picture of what the actual risk looks like. Now we get a very good picture of the age group that we have been worse at in Sweden, the young, who are often singled out as those who spread the infection.

So far, those responsible are satisfied with the Umeå project, which is being carried out on behalf of the [Swedish Public Health Agency](https://www.aftonbladet.se/tagg/6e5c565b-5b31-471c-a547-fe4c0123ed49) and is being implemented by Umeå University and the Västerbotten Region.

&gt; 
&gt; The role of vitamin D in innate and adaptive immunity is critical. A statistical error in the estimation of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D was recently discovered; in a correct analysis of the data used by the Institute of Medicine, it was found that 8895 IU/d was needed for 97.5% of individuals to achieve values ≥50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed that 6201 IU/d was needed to achieve 75 nmol/L and 9122 IU/d was needed to reach 100 nmol/L.

&gt;     It takes 3 to 12 months for vitamin D levels to come to a new plateau

The difference in total deaths between 2020 and the baseline since March and including August are 5002 deaths in excess. For the same period FHM reports 5830 deaths with COVID-19 and [Socialstyrelsen](https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/statistik-och-data/statistik/statistik-om-covid-19/statistik-over-antal-avlidna-i-covid-19/) reports 5692 death of COVID-19 until 26th of August (new update with data since is expected tomorrow). 
* Region Stockholm has officially left the ""staff"" situation that was active since March. There are only about 30 patients (including outside of ICU) in the region with COVID-19 in the hospitals. With this, operations can go back to normal.
* The study in Umeå that aims to test 20000 students and staff in the progress of two weeks to evaluate the spread of infection on the campus has had unexpectedly low positive cases in the first week of testing - from over 8000 tests only 2 were positive.

&amp;#x200B;

**Please, remember there is lag in reporting and deaths reported on a certain day are usually mostly deaths that happened on previous days. On average it takes up to 11 days to report 90% of the deaths for a certain day (see in the links graphs about how that looks)**

The hospital has every responsibility to supply you with PPE, but considering they either won’t, or are unable to, why don’t you put your protection in your own hands and purchase one?

Sure you’ll get price gouged if you want a legitimate NIOSH N95, but you should consider, that even a price gouged N95 costs less than your lunch. Seems like a worthwhile investment if you’re working with patients.

Alternatively walk out.

My sister is a dr and didn’t have the brains to think outside the box when her hospital/office/clinic decided they wouldn’t supply N95s. When I blasted her for coming in contact with my parents when she wasn’t wearing a mask at work. I told her an N95 is a minimum requirement if she’s coming in extended close contact with multiple strangers per day and then entering a house with people who are elderly and at risk with comorbidities. She couldn’t understand how people were getting N95s when the hospital wouldn’t even provide her one unless she was doing a procedure with an “aerosolizing event”. 

Buy one like the rest of us, online. Make sure you’re getting an authentic NIOSH approved one. That said commercial N95s, P95s and P100s are coming back on the market again. You can get one at Home Depot even. It’s not a medical mask, so you’re probably going to have to put a surgical mask over it to cover the exhale valve, but it’ll do the job if you’re desperate for PPE. 

In a world where I see normal everyday (non-essential) people wearing N95s as they shop at the supermarket...why won’t doctors who are encountering patients she’ll out a little dough to buy their own N95 when none is provided.

Please note, if your opinion is that a doctor shouldn’t have to shell out the meager sum for his/her own PPE, then I agree with you.

The ""1 in 5"" stat is for people who *didnt* isolate. Isolation drops that number significantly.


Household transmission is different than a bar. Think about it - 

If you have 5 people in your household, spending significant time together, and X gives it to Y (20% chance) .. you now have 2 people in five who have it, spending significant time together.  Now the infection chance is higher for the other 3. Once one of them gets it, now you have 3 people in 5. As long as infectious phases are overlapping, it ""multiplies"".

This is different than the transmission dynamics at a bar, which happens over 1 night.  If X gives it to Y, Y is not infectious yet.  You still only have one person who is infectious at the bar.

But thats the problem with your argument, because that is exactly what they would be if the cases were to go unreported.

You honestly think the rationale behind not wanting to be the next Wuhan is because Xi will be upset that you weren't truthful? No, you just need to hide it better.

&gt;Using other places that have also been clear of the virus and now have new cases isn't much of an argument.

It's statistics. I'm sorry you never received a class. I take it you're not an American, but I guarantee if you were you would've thought the polling was wrong in 2016.

&gt;As for the media restrictions, yes the media is controlled. But information flow isn't nearly as tight as you may think, i live in the city that had the most recent outbreak (if you can call a handful of cases an outbreak) and the news and gossip was flying about it before the official announcements. You really shouldn't believe that China has complete control of the internet because it's really not the case.

Your content is curated to such a ridiculous degree that you denying it while being exposed to the rest of the internet is quite sad. Likewise, I'd rather trust the dozens upon dozens of independent organizations and governments that have investigated internet censorship in China. It is widespread and harsh.

&gt;I'm pretty sure you'll never be convinced, because you wouldn't want to be naive but you kind of are being by using your preconceived ideas of China without actually truly knowing the place.

I'm using probability. I'm sorry that wasn't covered in any of your schooling. You can extrapolate from nations like South Korea and New Zealand, and use tools like the Bayesian Analysis to understand what the likelihood of certain situations are - even without full knowledge. 

Unfortunately, we don't have reliable mortality statistics from China to judge excess mortality. Quite literally the overwhelming majority of nations are under reporting deaths **and** cases. Nations like Indonesia, for example and based upon excess mortality, have likely had over 3x the reported deaths. Guess what, I don't trust their numbers. I don't have a bone to pick with Indonesians. Peru, Ecuador, Chile, the list goes on. I don't care about these nations either. But I can recognize that there are under-reportings, whether willful or not, in these nations. No one from these nations will argue with me like you are when I point this out.

Note, I'm not even stating that China is literally dying and the whole populace is one foot into the grave. I'm stating that zero domestic transmission is so extremely unlikely that I would seriously bet all of my money if there was some third-party, omniscient arbiter to give us the answer, that the government, both local and national, is willfully hiding the numbers.

On one hand you say ..

&gt; how come deaths from heart disease experienced significant drops in essentially all locked down areas?

And then you say ..

&gt;There was also a surge in both heart attack deaths and 911 calls for heart attacks in NYC that correlated perfectly with the spike in COVID deaths.

Your article is from the perspective of a hospital.  They say they are seeing fewer heart attack patients.  And they explain this - 

&gt;The most concerning possible explanation is that people stay home and suffer rather than risk coming to the hospital and getting infected with coronavirus. This theory suggests that Covid-19 has instilled fear of face-to-face medical care. As a result, many people with urgent health problems may be opting to remain at home rather than call for help.

Which is confirmed by articles like this -

&gt;More people in the United States are dying during the COVID-19 pandemic, **but not just because of the coronavirus**. One reason, experts say, is people with other ailments may not be seeking help.
&gt;  
&gt;That conclusion is emerging from new research showing *deaths are increasing from causes such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes* – while emergency room visits for those conditions are down.

And like this -

&gt;Aug. 7 (UPI) -- People who have a severe heart attack are more than twice as likely to die during the COVID-19 pandemic than they would have been in 2018-19, before the disease impacted the United States, according to an analysis published Friday by JAMA Cardiology.
&gt;  
&gt;Those who suffer a type of heart attack in which one of the heart's major arteries is blocked were 2.4 times more likely to die during the pandemic period, likely because they put off seeking medical care, the researchers said.

They’re already empty if restaurants are bars are shut down.  Mass unemployment is an issue but that could be covered via UI and/or UBI.

Ultimately IMO, the issue is whether or not society owes anything to bar and nightclub owners for shutting them down for the greater good.  Most countries (I assume Canada included), give a lot of leeway for public safety. It’s the highest priority and imperative for the state.  So are the bar owners the same as home owners losing their houses for the new freeway overpass via eminent domain?  Or are the temporary buggy whip factory owners that should’ve carried 18 mo of cash reserves?  Clearly they are not necessary even as far as airlines go.

What will probably happen at this point is that those trials already underway can proceed (there are several others underway) but new ones wouldn’t be approved; and tbh even those ones that are still underway may be halted early by their institutions’ ethical boards if their data so far look similar. When an effect size is this robust and when mortality is a real risk (remember 2 people died in the control group), trials are usually halted early in order to switch the control group over to the real drug. 

I do animal studies myself btw (I am a physiologist) and we are legally required to use smallest n possible to achieve acceptable statistical power, given the effect size &amp; variability seen in pilot trials. For example, if this were an animal study and I proposed a larger-n followup, it most likely wouldn’t get approved. And that’s animals; the bar is higher for humans.

Also, just generally, this is a normal n for an experimental trial on a clinical issue, a good n even, for a case-controlled intervention trial. In physiology we will do n’s as low as 8 per group when effect sizes are this strong. (8 per group for a two-group comparison is as low as you can go and still have a good probability of picking up an effect. I have squeaked through to significance in some cases with as low as 4 - that’s the mathematical limit if the two datasets are completely nonoverlapping - but I generally aim for 8 when I know it’s a strong effect size). Anyway, the logistics of intervention trials are utterly different than for epidemiological /correlational studies (where you are just collating data or combing through patient records &amp; not actually altering treatment).

### Abstract

Viruses are efficient metabolic engineers that actively rewire host metabolic pathways to support their lifecycle. Charting SARS-CoV-2 induced metabolic changes in lung cells could offer insight into COVID-19 pathogenesis while presenting new therapeutic targets. Here we show that the transcriptional response SARS-CoV-2 in primary lung epithelial cells and biopsies of COVID-19 patients is predominantly metabolic. This transcriptional signature was dominated by changes to lipid metabolism and the induction of IRE1 and PKR pathways of endoplasmic stress in a process regulated by several viral proteins. Transcriptional regulatory analysis of these changes reveals small clusters of transcription factors modulating key enzymes in each pathway. The upregulation of glycolysis and the dysregulation of the citric acid cycle was mediated by NFκB and RELA. While the upregulation of fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis showed a more complex control conditionally modulated by ER-stress activated PPARγ, C/EBP, and PPARα. Viral protein ORF3a appeared to interact with all three pathways suggesting both direct and indirect modulation of host metabolism. Finally, we show that PPARα-agonist fenofibrate reversed the metabolic changes induced by SARS-CoV-2 blocking viral replication.

## Abstract

Fenofibrate, which is a PPAR-alfpha agonist, increases the level of sulfatide. In this letter we hypothesize on the background of various findings that this is beneficial against COVID-19. Fenofibrate has been used for decades against hypercholesterolemia and has no serious side effects. Therefore, a trial giving fenofibrate to patients with corona virus infection is recommended.

1. to indicate a medical condition existing simultaneously but  independently with another condition in a patient (this is the older and  more ""correct"" definition)
2. to indicate a medical condition in a patient that causes, is caused  by, or is otherwise related to another condition in the same patient  (this is a newer, nonstandard definition and less well-accepted).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity#cite_note-2)

Moreover just as you are proving now, refuse to see how controlling and off putting to potential adopters rescuers that attitude can be.

A typical rescue response that rescues are perfect and those that don't like them are the problem.  As the previous poster likes to call it excuses yet its excuses that rescues reject potential adoptive families time and again.  However its okay because rescues do no wrong...

Having big yard may allow easier wash access but it still doesn't nothing to physically and mentally stimulate it.  Very few people do any sort of training exercises, beyond let the dog out while chatting on the phone. 

Yet there are dogs that do fine for long hours. So people that work shouldn't have pets? A good chunk of the population works, unless your one of the lucky few who can work from home.  I believe dog crates have their place but do not believe in long term crating.  For that xpens are a good solution. 

Separation anxiety is an issue with some dogs but that's where human commitment comes in dogwalker, family friend, etc.  Those that truly love their pets will adjust accordingly.  

Sigh.....this is why I stated reputable breeders not puppymill breeders. Reputable breeders do have a questionnaires, they are involved with their breeds, long after their pups have left and grown into adults and seniors good breeders still keep in contact.  Unfortunately there are more crappy breeders than reputable ones.

I'm going to think out loud here with you. The fact that you're young; you're not experiencing systemic symptoms of weight loss, etc.; it was painful; it was acute and has gone down to what is likely a residual lymph node makes me inclined to think it was just an infection. The fact that it was unilateral, however, makes me worried because most infections would cause bilateral painful lymphadenopathy. What I would be worried about is a lymphoma, since non-hodgkin lymphomas, in particular follicular lymphoma, is known to begin in a cervical lymph node and doesn't usually present with the B symptoms common in other lymphomas. But, this lymphoma is most common in adults 65 and older and it's unlikely you have it as a 28 year old.

I think you're okay and I'm so sorry to have worried you. Just please be watchful for symptoms like fever, night sweats, weight loss, and if something seems out of ordinary, perhaps consider going to a sliding scale clinic or something of the like? (I also glanced at your post history, if you work at Amazon perhaps consider applying for a government job instead? A government job of any kind, because the health insurance benefits and other benefits are usually amazing). And in general, of course sleep well, eat well, and exercise like you say you do!

I'm not one of those who thinks that ""one death is too many"" but removing all restrictions post-vaccine is basically saying that there's nothing else we can do and giving up.

(Women are mostly encouraged to explore their feelings and to actively talk about them. Men have no feelings that we can show without society thinking we are weak or whatever stupid crap they try to sell us)

This isn't to take away from women and children being abused which is horrible, more to state that ANY domestic violence is too much and to highlight an issue that is being mostly ignored.

Statistics:

166 Million Women in the US: 41.5 million abused

160 Million Men in the US: 17.7 million abused

(I don't have statistics for men that are in relationships with other men or women who are in relationships with women, if someone has those numbers that would be great to have as well. We need to end all domestic violence.)

Those numbers are also the people in general who have come forward and said I need help or answered a poll honestly. I believe the number is much larger for both men and women, just that in a lot of cases it's stigmatized or their situation prevents it.

Background: I was a police officer who got in for all the right reasons and then realized exactly what being an officer was about and what was actively encouraged and left. There were quite a few times we would show up to a domestic violence call where the men would be all kinds of black and blue with a fat lip and the women would be fine minus some busted knuckles. Yet the man would say he already had those fresh wounds and that he is fine and just wants to go about his day.

In the same situation - in my experience - women who were abused are much more likely to come forward and ask us to help and to take the offender to jail and direct them to a resource that could help.

All that being said there are women who don't come forward due to being scared or believing they are stuck in that situation. (I apologize again to the LGBTQ+ community as I don't have a lot of experience with situations dealing directly with households of multiple men or women or a mix, I am certain there are people in those situations that are being manipulated or abused and it's all horrible but I don't have any direct experience to relate.

 This is the most common antiparasitic used in the livestock industry.  The animal version is widely self administered by humans for scabies, mites and various other ailments in the US, and for intestinal parasites in third world countries.  The dosages look correct for humans, but you don't need to take it every day. Take 20mg for a roughly 200lb person on  Day 1, Day3 and Day 8.  Take 10mg for a 100lb person.   DO NOT take it with a high fat meal as it can effectively double the dose.  Though, it's almost impossible to have significant adverse reactions even at double the dose.   Look up Ivermectin paste on Amazon and you'll see that 98pct of the reviews are from humans using it.  It costs only about 3$ for a paste tube of 113mg at Tractor Supply. DO NOT get the pour on type! It was originally developed by Merck for human use. The human version is branded as Stromectal and is rather expensive.  In virus infected persons, it enters infected cells and fights the virus. Perhaps more important is that it lowers the PH level of the infected cells and allows zinc to enter and finish off the virus. Take zinc at 50mg twice a day.  Another antiparasitic with very similar functionality is Quercetin which is available over the counter at ""Vitamin Shoppe"" or online(take 500mg twice a day).  You should also be taking  Vit C at 2000mg per day, Vit D3 at 125mcg per day, Vit K2 at 50mcg per day(take these 2 together).  All of these have synergistic effects. It won't hurt to take both Ivermectin and Quercetin. DO NOT forget the zinc! Also get zinc lozenges and use them frequently.  If you've been very sick for a few days, start loading up on antiinflammatories including famotidine, melatonin, aleve and ibuprofen to reduce the impending cytokine storm that damages organs.  
Whatever you do, don't listen to the death merchants saying there are no effective treatments.   Although we may not have a vaccine, there are certainly things you can do to reduce the severity of the infection and resulting cytokine damage.  You can also use these substances as a phrophalaxis if you are in the same household as an infected person but you won't need the antinflammatories unless you are infected.  Also get sunlight and stop smoking and drinking.
I've recommend this regimen to about 10 people who tested positive and were symptomatic and each of them were nearly asymptomatic within 48-72 hours.  In fact, I keep all these ingredients on hand in case my family or neighbors get test positive and are asked to treat at home.

**Added value of this study**

We did a systematic review of 172 observational studies in health-care and non-health-care settings across 16 countries and six continents; 44 comparative studies were included in a meta-analysis, including 25 697 patients with COVID-19, SARS, or MERS. Our findings are, to the best of our knowledge, the first to rapidly synthesise all direct information on COVID-19 and, therefore, provide the best available evidence to inform optimum use of three common and simple interventions to help reduce the rate of infection and inform non-pharmaceutical interventions, including pandemic mitigation in non-health-care settings. Physical distancing of 1 m or more was associated with a much lower risk of infection, as was use of face masks (including N95 respirators or similar and surgical or similar masks \[eg, 12–16-layer cotton or gauze masks\]) and eye protection (eg, goggles or face shields). Added benefits are likely with even larger physical distances (eg, 2 m or more based on modelling) and might be present with N95 or similar respirators versus medical masks or similar. Across 24 studies in health-care and non-health-care settings of contextual factors to consider when formulating recommendations, most stakeholders found these personal protection strategies acceptable, feasible, and reassuring but noted harms and contextual challenges, including frequent discomfort and facial skin breakdown, high resource use linked with the potential to decrease equity, increased difficulty communicating clearly, and perceived reduced empathy of care providers by those they were caring for.",,1599488178,{},g4bzx7r,True,t3_io85gs,False,True,t3_io85gs,/r/Coronavirus/comments/io85gs/physical_distancing_face_masks_and_eye_protection/g4bzx7r/,1599488189,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Cholcalciferol (D3) has a bioavailability of 20 to 70%. That means your body can choose how much of a vitamin D pill it wants to take in and then convert to the useful form, depending on how deficient you are.

25(OH)D3 has a bioavailability of about 95%, which means it's coming in whether your body needs it or not. And that can lead to overdose very easily. 

Too much vitamin D leads to high calcium levels, which can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, thirst and frequent urination. In extreme cases, vitamin D overdose can lead to kidney damage and bone loss (pulls calcium from your bones).

If you stand out in the bright sun with bare skin, your body will make the D3 version. Your liver will convert D3 to the 25(OH)D3 version, which has a half-life of around 2 weeks. Kidneys then add another oxygen molecule to make 1,25(OH)D3, which is the version that goes inside the cells to support normal cell function.

It would still be basketball, right? Still shooting a ball into a hoop...

Some players will manage well, others will struggle, plenty will be caught somewhere in between and need time to figure out how to thrive under these new, drastically different circumstances - but they're professionals who have trained hard and are up to the challenge.

Sure, the standards we use to judge effective players from ones who need additional support, remediation, or removal could be adjusted, but it's going to take some time to figure that out. And to complicate things, in the upcoming season, it's announced that some games may still be played under the old rules, but they're definitely moving forward with the new rules - maybe we'll be forced to start the season one way, and hopefully  revert back to the old later on if the situation allows for it...But that's probably being too optimistic, and maybe they'll just need to train and prepare for the new way.

The final stroke came with the control of COVID-19 research by the Ministry of Health. Despite the great interest in research on COVID-19 in Turkey by researchers and physicians, the Turkish Ministry of Health announced a mandatory application for permission for research on COVID-19, before any application is made to ethics committees.[9](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31691-3/fulltext#bib9)  
 This unprecedented decision was against the Constitution[10](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31691-3/fulltext#bib10)  
 and laws regulating research activities in Turkey. It appears that most submitted projects have been approved by the Ministry of Health, but some projects, including a large, multicentre observational study by the Turkish Thoracic Society, have been rejected without any clear explanation.

The regular procedure for research activities in Turkey is well defined. In keeping with the international regulations, researchers must get approval from the independent ethics committee. The Turkish Constitution clearly states that “everyone can learn science and art freely and has the right to teach, explain, disseminate and research in these areas”.[10](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31691-3/fulltext#bib10)  
 The Science Academy, a member of the International Science Council, has highlighted this fact.[11](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31691-3/fulltext#bib11)  
 The Turkish Medical Association and other professional medical organisations made a declaration through a press conference and urged the Ministry of Health to cancel their decision.

In conclusion, we, as respiratory physicians and scientists, are worried about the restrictions imposed by the Turkish Ministry of Health on independent research about the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey, and we sincerely hope that the Ministry of Health's decision will be taken back in compliance with the Turkish Constitution.",,1599488010,{},g4bzk0r,True,t3_io84op,False,True,t3_io84op,/r/Coronavirus/comments/io84op/interference_in_scientific_research_on_covid19_in/g4bzk0r/,1599488021,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I’m from a very large family (direct and extended) and I am pretty much the loan ranger of still maintaining extremely militant mitigation protocols since March. I think it helps that I’m a science nerd and in healthcare so I followed the severity of COVID in China right after their New Year celebrations. I saw the videos of people just collapsing in the streets and dying and I knew in my gut it would be here all too soon and it was way more serious then people wanted to admit and still aren’t admitting. 

I basically got into several arguments with my siblings and other family members who have grown fatigued (which is entirely disappointing because I will say they were like myself and being militant as well), but mentally I think they’re spent. I’m like you saying “we’ve made it THIS FAR with having to endure all of this, why give up now?” I even had one of my siblings say, “if it’s just a year and some change to protect my family and our entire family we can do it;” now, her kids are back to in person learning, with asking my immunocompromised relative to help watch the kids post school so they can work. My other sibling who lasted in NYC with their family for the entire pandemic, just taps out and relocated to Florida for the next two months of all places just two weeks ago because they “had to get out of their apartment bc they’re all depressed.”  

It is entirely discouraging at times as you have noted and I know they’re thinking I’m a lunatic for being so militant still, but I don’t want this thing and I don’t want to be responsible for giving it to anyone else. I don’t want the life of someone else on my hands because I couldn’t mentally tough it out and be selfless. Some people have even said back to me when I’ve said “well would if you get this family member sick who has heart health and immune issues already and they end up alone, hospitalized or worse die because of your selfish behavior?,” and they’re reply was simply, “yes, what would we do if that happens?” As if contact tracing is such a joke no one could pin it on them. Ugh this all sucks. It’s tearing our nation and families apart just off of proper protocol that shouldn’t be controversial.

A statistical error in the estimation of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D was recently discovered; in a correct analysis of the data used by the Institute of Medicine, it was found that 8895 IU/d was needed for 97.5% of individuals to achieve values ≥50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed that 6201 IU/d was needed to achieve 75 nmol/L and 9122 IU/d was needed to reach 100 nmol/L.

It doesn’t have to be elaborate or well thought out. Just send it, send a simple “I am so grateful to have you in my life” text. Receiving a text like that, even from someone you haven’t spoken to in awhile, can mean so much.

Your friends CARE about you. You are not an annoyance to them. You are not a burden. Your feelings are valid and it’s okay to have them.

These feelings will pass. 2020 will pass. Stop saying “I wish” and “I want” and start saying “I will”. I will come out of this stronger. I will grow from this. I will go to the gym. I will read a book. I will learn how to cook. 

Brush your teeth. Make your bed. Take a shower. Practice self-care because that stuff WORKS. If you’re too depressed to get out of bed and find yourself watching tv, I highly recommend watching Queer Eye. And truly watch it, put your phone away. I also highly recommend children’s shows if you’re in a deep funk. She-Ra, both Avatar series, Adventure Time, whatever makes you happy!! Nostalgia is a hell of a thing, and it’s fun to trick your brain into being happy by watching or doing something that made you happy when you were younger.

So that means that:

0.9 × 0.67 × 0.75 = 45% of the population has induced immunity

10% has natural immunity, for a total of 55%.

The base transmission rate is assumed to be close to 3.  This means that, after the end of the vaccine program, each infected person would infect 1.35 people if no mitigations were in place. (This assumes that super-spreaders are equally likely to be infected as the rest of the population, which may not be true, of course... but let's assume for this scenario that it is).

If we could maintain social distancing for a few months and halve that transmission rate, we'd be very close to elimination — but if we did nothing, we'd infect the rest of the population not just until herd immunity was reached (maximum effective transmission rate of 1) but until enough of the population had been infected that the virus significantly declined (perhaps 3 months after maximum R(t) = 0.8, somewhere in the region of 75% of the population being immune).

So we have to infect a further \~20% of the population naturally in order to trigger extinction of the virus, unless we maintain some element of distancing. Obviously 1/3 of that 20% will come from the voluntarily unvaccinated — screw them — but 2/3 of the yet-to-be-infected, or 13.3%, will have been vaccinated but it just didn't work on them. Many of those will be those who are most vulnerable to Covid-19, or the vaccine would have worked in the first place.

Once it spreads itself to 6 people instead of 3, it doesn't care if you die or not.

What happens though is that the human immune system retains some cross reactive antibodies to the prior strains and therefore future infections become less severe.  This is why 1918 influenza became seasonal influenza, this is also why 2009 pandemic influenza was not a big deal because everyone alive before 1957 had some cross reactive immunity.  This is also why diseases were more deadly to the naive immune systems of Native Americans.

&gt; And there has been very very promising research of a long lasting immune response through memory cells of the immune system. Suggesting that immunity lasts for years to come. Quite the contrary to other Coronaviruses.

There's no evidence of recombination in influenza, so instead it swaps genetic material through reassortment only.  So the H1 envelope protein in 2009 H1N1 is a descendant from the 1918 envelope protein.  The N1 though came entirely from swine origin.  The PA and PB2 genes are entirely from avian origin.

Coronaviruses do swap genetic material from recombination, so organisms that infections from multiple coronaviruses can lead to ""gene splicing"" of fragments between the different virus strains.  One of the problems in determining the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is that it formed from some kind of recombination event like this, but there's no clean signal with one gene from virus A, one gene from virus B.  So it actually mutates a lot more readily this way than influenza does (when you have multiple co-infections in the same organism and genetic swapping occurs).

There's of course also the mutating that occurs as the virus infects an organism and there influenza has no proof reading machinery and evolves faster than SARS-CoV-2 does.  That is the much more common form of mutation.  So there you'd be right.  However, SARS-CoV-2 doesn't mutate that much slower the influenza does (I can't recall offhand, but I looked it up awhile back and it was only like a factor of 2 or 3 slower).  Really this is the kind of mutation that governs if new serotypes emerge and how long it takes between epidemics of the virus -- the recombination/reassortment events are triggers for new pandemic spread.  So while you're wrong about the comparison to influenza vis a vis recombination/reassortment you're also wrong that it is an important thing to consider for new epidemic spread, so those kinds cancels out.  What remains is that it mutates somewhat slower than influenza.

You are also correct that all the variants of SARS-CoV-2 thus far should cross react with antibodies from any vaccine:

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.228213v1

But we should see the emergence of new serotypes of SARS-CoV-2 eventually that don't cross react with those antibodies.

We also expect immunity to be short lived based on the similarity to seasonal coronavirus:

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.20086439v2.full.pdf

It would be probably good to eradicate SARS-CoV-2 as much as possible to eliminate the possibility of recombination producing a new pandemic.  That would likely require everyone in the world getting vaccinated during a given year.

It'll probably remain as a seasonal coronavirus.  Unless there's one of those recombination events though it should start to look more like the other seasonal coronaviruses and less like this mess -- just like the 1918 pandemic started out a nightmare and evolved into seasonal influenza.",,1599437845,{},g4a7uzh,False,t3_in9fxt,False,True,t1_g47d5ed,/r/Coronavirus/comments/in9fxt/several_states_in_mexico_are_running_out_of_death/g4a7uzh/,1599437856,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

There are a few variables, one of which is mobility. If you look at the last graph you will see that the IHME model predicts what will happen if China _conpletely opens_. There models basically always have this assumption. Some people call the model a ""reasonable worst case scenario"" for that reason.

In any case, if there is another outbreak China they know they can't keep opening. They don't need to look at the IHME model. The already know what a future outbreak looks like. And they will lockdown.

The model is more useful in other places. Like maybe Florida should consider it when thinking about what to open and when. It also shows a scenario for 95 percent mask compliance that maybe they should look at.

Because the liver step is controlled by the body to produce only on demand.

The kidney step is simply dose dependent. More 25(OH) present, and you get more 1,25(OH)D3.


And the latter form is the actual active Vitamin D, at which point an overdose, even just a small one can cause drastic effects.

100,000IU of the active form will cause serious symptoms of hypervitaminosis D3.

I've been taking Prozac since March 2016. I was finally able to get a job in December 2016 just because I was able to fake-smile my way through the interview. Then I worked at a movie theater until March 8. 2020- where I was laid off because of COVID.  I never really felt depressed during my time working.

This is why I don't think these business shutdowns are worth it.  Not only are they causing depression, they are causing financial pains and distress that can last decades on the people.  Depression, suicides, and drug and alcohol abuse are rampant in areas of the rust belt where factories have shut down.

Up until last month I had a list of peer reviewed scientific articles along with lists of links debunking every blasted thing they said.  I truly worked myself close to a breakdown trying to educate those people.  

Bottom line is they don't want to be educated.  They prefer to be willfully ignorant.  

I have 4 adult children and my 2 oldest land in the willfully ignorant category. One is the mother of three of my grandchildren and because of her choices I can't see them and they are being told ""Nana is paranoid so she doesn't want you around.""  All it would take is them wearing masks and maintaining social distance and they refuse because ""the death rate is only 1%"" (despite all evidence to the contrary and the long term effects).

All this being said.... put the info out there if you strongly feel that you must.  But don't argue.  At this point in the pandemic nobody is going to change their stance / beliefs.  There is an entire world that has proven it can be done and it's not acceptable proof.  I'm even seeing a lot of people who get infected and have a horrible time healing and STILL say masks are worthless or it was just the flu.

I figured this out a couple weeks ago, after six months of wake up start work and work until I sleep. I thought I was being flexible and it started that way but gradually became all consuming. You have to establish hard boundaries. 

What worked for me was a couple weeks ago I forced myself to take a few days off and signed out of email chat etc. When I went back I signed in on my desktop but not my phone. My phone is now a work free zone for two weeks and it feels great. I can't see myself ever going back to having work chat etc on my phone if I'm teleworking. 

You have to draw the line. 

Also the advice is to continue personal care etc as if you were still going to work. Because you will neglect them otherwise. I thought that wasn't always true. I was wrong. Simple things like your teeth will get screwed up if you aren't caring for them everyday. It's easy to forget things like that when days all blur together. So its important to set a routine and stick to it. Which I still struggle with having a set time etc for it personally. It's hard mentally when you just don't need to care because it's just you in the house so who cares if you are wearing yesterday's clothes, which can become who cares if you've been showing up to work in the same pajamas every day for a week because nobody will see anyway. And then you slowly hate yourself for not doing more for yourself, and then you wake up one day and realize this is what depression looks like.",,1599452174,{},g4au7xo,False,t3_insfkf,False,True,t1_g4a96bk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/insfkf/signs_of_depression_have_tripled_in_the_us_since/g4au7xo/,1599452184,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Doctors said trials showed nearly half of patients in trials showed no evidence of lung damage at 12 weeks.

Although they confirm longstanding fears that Covid patients can suffer serious effects weeks after recovering from the virus, the results are the first to show that these tend to heal over time.

Eighty-six patients from an outbreak hot-spot in the Tyrolean region of Austria were hospitalised between April 29 and June 9, then followed up at six, 12 and 24 weeks after discharge.

At the six-week visit, 88 per cent of patients showed evidence of lung damage, but this dropped to 56 per cent at the 12-week check-up.

The results from the 24-week visits are not yet ready to be published. Meanwhile 65 per cent of the cohort showed general symptoms of lung problems at the six-week visit, with breathlessness the most common symptom - 47 per cent - followed by coughing - 15 per cent.

By 12 weeks, breathlessness had improved and was present in 39 per cent of patients.

The proportion of patients coughing at this stage did not improve as markedly, however, only dropping to 13 per cent.

Dr Sabina Sahanic, who worked on the study at the University Clinic in Innsbruck, said: ""The bad news is that people show lung impairment from Covid-19 weeks after discharge; the good news is that the impairment tends to ameliorate over time, which suggests the lungs have a mechanism for repairing themselves.”

The average age of the patients was 61, with 65 per cent male.

Nearly half were former smokers, and more than six in 10 were overweight or obese.


One in five had been admitted to an intensive care unit, and roughly the same proportion placed on a mechanical ventilator. The patients were followed up with lung function tests.

Only 23 per cent performed at 80 per cent less than normal at six weeks, but the proportion did not improve significantly over time.

CT scans showed that the score that defines the severity of overall lung damage decreased from eight points at six weeks to four points at 12 weeks Presented at the European Respiratory Society International Conference on Monday, the results follow months of warnings from medical experts that people who suffered badly with coronavirus can expect long-lasting effects.

In July the NHS announced plans to launch an online Covid rehabilitation service, including virtual access to physiotherapists, in recognition of the long-term needs.

Published alongside the Innsbruck research was another study which found that the sooner patients begin pulmonary rehabilitation after coming off a ventilator, the faster they recovered. Spending days on a ventilator can result in severe muscle loss, particularly in the muscles used for breathing.

Pulmonary rehabilitation, which involves physical exercises and advice on managing symptoms, including shortness of breath and post-traumatic stress disorder, is crucial for helping patients to recover fully, the researchers said.

Yara Al Chikhanie, from Grenoble Alps University, said: ""The sooner rehabilitation started and the longer it lasted, the faster and better was the improvement in patients' walking and breathing capacities and muscle gain.

""Patients who started rehabilitation in the week after coming off their ventilators progressed faster than those who were admitted after two weeks.”",,1599477726,{},g4bklim,True,t3_io5fya,False,True,t3_io5fya,/r/Coronavirus/comments/io5fya/lungs_damaged_by_coronavirus_can_repair/g4bklim/,1599477737,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Then they did not even assess baseline vitamin D and just extrapolated from the general population that patients were deficient. Then, ICU admission is a tricky parameter to assess the effectiveness of a treatment, because it only allows certain statistical analyses. I was also surprised to see, that their non-vitamin D group was half as big as the treatment group and then they people in the non-treatment group had twice as many patients with high blood pressure, which is known to be an important risk factor. In total, this is an interesting, yet fairly low value starting point for future investigation and I find it troubling that people start drawing medication conclusions from it. To claim, as the heading does, that Vitamin D reduces the risk of ICU admission by 97% is just misleading! It does it in one particular setting and at the very least it should read ""CAN reduce ICU admission UP TO 97%"".

Which itself leads to the question what is history of this tongue twister.

Evidently it is a city name located on lower Egypt called al-zaqaziq - which is slightly better - but because Egyptians pronounce the Q as a G (Arabic pronunciation variation) - it has wound up as Zagazig.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zagazig

&gt;Arabic: الزقازيق‎ az-Zaqāzīq

&gt;Zagazig University, one of the largest universities in Egypt, is also located in the city, with colleges in different fields of science and arts. The Archaeological Museum of the University of Zagazig exhibits significant finds from the nearby sites, Bubastis (Tell Basta) and Kufur Nigm.[2] Also there is a branch for Al-Azhar University, the largest Islamic university in the world.

&gt;The city was found in the 19th century on a place of a village called Nazlat az-Zaqāzīq which was named after the Zaqzuq family. The family's name itself comes form a dialectal word zaqzuq or ziqziq which means ""a small creature"" (e.g. a fish or a mouse) and comes from a Coptic word ""ant or other insect"".",,1599477294,{},g4bk6pv,True,t3_io30w5,False,True,t1_g4bieu2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/io30w5/prophylactic_ivermectin_in_covid19_contacts/g4bk6pv/,1599477305,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I disagree. Strongly.

A couple of years ago, I was socially isolated. No friends. No social interaction with anyone besides my family. Then I went to grad school and idk how but things just flipped upside down. I made a million friends and was going out all the time. I was genuinely happy. I wasn't ""masking my depression"" because reality is, human beings ARE NOT MEANT to live isolated lives. We are a social animal. Our ""regular normal"" is our actual normal that humans have lived in for generations across many different cultures.

Speaking as a parent of two schoolkids (11 and 13 - wish I'd picked better names), I can state with a certain amount (well, 6 months to be precise) of experience that the impact of school closures to the mental well-being of kids is absolutely huge and, given the seemingly low impact of Covid19 on school-age children, I'd be confident in saying that the risk of serious damage to children through further extended absence may indeed be much greater than that caused by this virus. This doesn't, of course, take into account secondary infections to other people - teachers, parents, relatives (I did say this was nuanced!) - but there is certainly a case to be made that kids should go back to school even if the risk of them catching Covid 19 is statistically higher than if they stayed at home.

My own kids return tomorrow and I for one am very glad to see it. I'm worried (of course) but I was far more worried, especially about my eldest, during the darkest days of lockdown. And no, before you ask, Zoom is not a viable alternative to the classroom. It's not even close.

41 children from Italy with MIS-C and 10 from Stockholm have been compared with 28 children diagnosed with Kawasaki before the COVID-19 pandemic. They map out the differences and similarities. 

SUMMARY 

SARS-CoV-2 infection is typically very mild and often asymptomatic in children. A complication is the rare Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19, presenting 4-6 weeks after infection as high fever, organ dysfunction and strongly elevated markers of inflammation. The pathogenesis is unclear but has overlapping features with Kawasaki disease suggestive of vasculitis and a likely autoimmune etiology. We apply systems-level analyses of blood immune cells, cytokines and autoantibodies in healthy children, children with Kawasaki disease enrolled prior to COVID-19, children infected with SARS-CoV-2 and children presenting with MIS-C. We find that the inflammatory response in MIS-C differs from the cytokine storm of severe acute COVID-19, shares several features with Kawasaki disease, but also differs from this condition with respect to T-cell subsets, IL-17A and biomarkers associated with arterial damage. Finally, autoantibody profiling suggests multiple autoantibodies that could be involved in the pathogenesis of MIS-C.",,1599478734,{},g4blli5,True,t3_io5u0a,False,True,t3_io5u0a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/io5u0a/rare_hyperinflammatory_syndrome_in_children_with/g4blli5/,1599478744,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Nahhh... There's several countries that didnt have the deaths Sweden had, and some of them even saw less of a decline in their GDP.


&gt;And the reverse is also true: countries where the economic impact has been modest – like Taiwan, South Korea, and Lithuania – have also managed to keep the death rate low.

&gt;Notice too that countries with similar falls in GDP have witnessed very different death rates. For instance, compare the US and Sweden with Denmark and Poland. All four countries saw economic contractions of around 8 to 9 percent, but the death rates are markedly different: the US and Sweden have recorded 5 to 10 times more deaths per million.

D with sunscreen use. From what I could grasp of the full text (just copy the study name to Google scholar, you will find the pdf), they tried to get away from the artificial uv light used in older studies in order to see if the vit. D blocking effect persists in natural light conditions.
However, from what i could read now (bathroom breaks during work are limited in time), the majority of studies they identified used a real life setting with the instruction for ppl to use the sunscreen in a ""controlled"" way (protocol driven). In this condition, the blocking effect of sunscreen wasn't significant anymore.

HOWEVER, this data more or less tells me ""during normal life, if you apply sunscreen when you have extended periods of time in the sun, it won't negatively influence your vit. D levels."" But, in these conditions, it's virtually impossible to fully control everything. To me, it deficit looks like sunscreen blocks the vit. D production, but the effect doesn't matter if you still have a normal life with standard outdoor activities.

So i would not say sunscreen doesn't block it, i would say it doesn't matter if you have a normal life and do not have sunscreen on all the time.

I reckon a better study would use true sunlight exposure in a similar way than the older studies used the artificial light.
By virtue of logic, the vitamin d production HAS to be limited or blocked because the required energy doesn't reach the cells.
But it also doesn't matter in the big picture.
But also keep in mind, there are many parents who won't let their kids out EVER without a 50 sunscreen.

[],,ImJustHere4Fun,,,[],,,,text,t2_175i1r,False,True,[],"Since the coronavirus pandemic started, public health officials in the United States have faced harassment and death threats, and some have even been driven from office. Now a university deeply involved in studying the virus has warned hundreds of its researchers to be on the lookout for dangerous packages.

Last Monday, the University of Washington, based in Seattle, sent an email to about 500 of its researchers telling them to be wary of suspicious packages and saying that virus researchers elsewhere had been targeted.

“We have received unfortunate reports from our contacts at the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) that threatening mail has been sent to COVID-19 researchers on the east coast of the United States,” said the email, which was first reported by BuzzFeed News on Saturday (https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kenbensinger/suspicious-package-covid-19-researchers-fbi).

The BuzzFeed News article quoted an F.B.I. spokesman saying that the bureau, “along with our local law enforcement partners, responded to a suspicious package sent to a few university researchers” and that “preliminary testing has indicated there is no threat to public safety in connection with this mailing.”

A University of Washington spokeswoman, Susan Gregg, provided a copy of the university’s email to The New York Times and said no suspicious packages had been reported so far.

The email warned researchers to be on the lookout for signs of suspicious mail, including an address with misspelled words, no return address, oily stains, discoloration or a strange odor. Any mail that raised concerns, the email said, should be left unopened and reported to the police by calling 911.

Research at the University of Washington includes 16 clinical studies related to the virus and a prominent but sometimes criticized forecasting model. The model estimated last week that Covid-19 would kill about 410,000 people in the United States by the end of the year, more than double the current death toll, drawing skepticism from experts who said predictions about the course of the pandemic months into the future are too uncertain to be useful.

The report of threats to researchers follows earlier signs of the risks faced by public health officials and others involved in the pandemic response. Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of President Trump’s virus task force and the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases, received additional security in April after threats, and he said the security was also expanded to his daughters. Local and state health officials have also been targeted by those challenging public health measures.",,1599499692,{},g4cr7a5,True,t3_iobtzl,False,True,t3_iobtzl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iobtzl/a_university_known_for_coronavirus_research_warns/g4cr7a5/,1599501157,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Being dehydrated can make you feel like your whole world is coming down during an anxiety attack. All this is compounded when you get out of the daily habits you used to follow to take care of yourself.

"" Knowing the number of deaths during a period of the pandemic is not enough. To calculate excess deaths we still need to know how many people we would have *expected* to have died if the pandemic had not occurred. To do this it is common to compare the number of deaths during a period of the pandemic with the average number of deaths during the same period in previous years.

In the absence of crises, there is often only small variability in the number of people who die year-to-year. By looking at death tolls in previous years we can understand the baseline of how many people we would expect to have died without the pandemic.

As an example, to calculate the number of excess deaths in a given population in May: we could look at the total number of deaths observed in May this year, and subtract the average number of deaths in May in the previous 5 years.""

So Covid deaths are adding to the excess but other deaths (especially in March - May) were likely lower with people remaining in a quasi-lockdown.  This means more things are under normal and COVID is likely being under-reported if there are 210,000ish excess deaths.  Regardless of how it's going to be spun, we have that many deaths over the expected rate of death in the US during the same time period.  When the data is really tabulated in a few years, we likely can get a better grasp but it's not going to be a great look for the US regardless.",,1599502593,{},g4cy7u7,False,t3_io6hcd,False,True,t1_g4crfjy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/io6hcd/coronavirus_rising_in_22_us_states/g4cy7u7/,1599504578,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

The disease symptoms arise in two ways:

1. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced inside cells, in order to kill pathogens. When too many are produced, cell damage, and ultimately, cell death results.
2. Receptors used by pathogens to enter cells are downregulated in order to restrict infection. This usually takes the form of reduced expression, but desensitization and receptor blockade by antibodies are also seen. When this is prolonged, it contributes to cell death.

Receptor dowregulation also very often causes other disease symptoms unrelated to cell death. For example, when the ACE-2 receptor is downregulated in response to infection by SARS viruses, this results in severe vasoconstriction, so that lung capillaries cannot take up sufficient oxygen, and systemic hypertension is also a result.

Although infection is a major driver, chronic, aberrant NF-kB activation also very frequently occurs in the absence of infection, and this also results in excessive ROS production and receptor downregulation, resulting in disease. For example, reduced expression and sensitivity of insulin receptors results in type 2 diabetes, acetylcholine NACH receptor blockade by antibodies results in myasthenia gravis (and possibly chronic fatigue syndrome), and blockade of the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor causes thyroiditis.

So, if you are infected by both cytomegalovirus and SARS-CoV-2, this could be a 'double whammy', but there are many such possible coinfections, for example Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease, mycobacteria (TB, leprosy), Hepatitis C, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Toxoplasma gondii protozoon, and the rest of the herpes family.",,1599504192,{},g4d1vuh,False,t3_iocgi4,False,True,t3_iocgi4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iocgi4/the_ancient_and_the_new_is_there_an_interaction/g4d1vuh/,1599506401,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1599504401.0,,

Same as the stereotype, it had very high expectations of their students, and what is more, we had real neurotic nuns that would beat us with yardsticks on occasion. Rarely, though. I would say the education was quite good, but there was a bit of religious indoctrination. We had to attend mass and confess our sins; there was a bit of psychological guilt play if we didn't. I found it uncomfortable I had to tell older men I was touching myself or looking at indecent pictures when confessing and other kids felt it was strange, too. But you couldn't take the confirmation sacrament and graduate if we didn't do that. Today that is sexual harassment by definition, but we all know it's a Catholic sin children must confess against their will.

I was depressed for a year after finishing that school but did alright afterwards. Some others didn't do so well, and others did better. It was probably a school that prepared people better academically but didn't develop our emotional competencies. I'd say that for the forms 1-4 when I attended the school my environment was generally emotionally unavailable to me. Pupils were forced into a stiff upper lip culture in that school. Many adults thought we were all precocious, which was admirable in the 90s when I had this experience. The dangers of not letting a child ""just be"" and forcing them into adulthood were not talked about at all then. I still have some problems with ""just being"", but I've worked out most of them with my therapists.

It's definitely a mixed bag from my point of view. My academic performance was stellar though, way ahead of the other kids at the start of middle school. Although honestly the instruction was too much focused on rote memorization and that advantage didn't last.

There are all these stories about colleges closing or having issues (My son was suppose to go to college in MA and is online now).  Cedar City Utah has 33k population and the college SUU has 11.300 students on campus in person. Public schools are also open in person with over 8k students and staff. Since March there have been 630 cases in the county, with 0 people needing to be in the hospital, and 0 deaths. There are currently 40 active cases in the county.  Both K-12 and college have been open normally (just masks and extra cleaning ) since Aug 13? so almost a month. I just have tried to figure out why this small college town is successful so far and others are not? Overall the population is very young, but that would be true in most college towns? The elevation is high, I have read a few studies that suggest higher elevations get less severe cases? Overall better health to start with?  Being landlocked? (but being landlocked means that you travel to big cities to make many purchases , no amazon does not deliver in one day nor does the post office, if you need a car part , you have to drive to a big city or wait).

It seems like you're operating on some assumptions and or bad experiences with your opinion.

I have to ask, why do you have such a complete lack of faith in teachers?

Instead of treating teachers like they are the bad guys, maybe you should look to ways to support them and see what it's actually like for them?
Or does that inconvenience your opinion too much?

That said, just like any profession in the world, there will be those who take advantage of times like these and those that are terrible at their profession.

Your solution at a modified evaluation structure is great in theory but will never happen. No funding to actually have someone (who has likely never been in a classroom) to write up some arbitrary bullshit to evaluate teachers by.

No matter what educators do, children are going to suffer in one form or another whether it's academically, socially, physically regardless of a pandemic. The pandemic for sure amplifies and brings to light the myriad of problems though.

&gt; Indeed, humans make several important peptide and hormone “photoproducts” when our skin is exposed to the UVB wavelength of sunlight (22). These include:
&gt; 
&gt; -   β-Endorphin: a natural opiate that induces relaxation and increases pain tolerance (23, 24)
&gt; -   Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide: a vasodilator that protects against hypertension, vascular inflammation, and oxidative stress (25)
&gt; -   Substance P: a neuropeptide that promotes blood flow and regulates the immune system in response to acute stressors (26)
&gt; -   Adrenocorticotropic Hormone: a polypeptide hormone that controls cortisol release by the adrenal glands, thus regulating the immune system and inflammation (27)
&gt; -   Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone: a polypeptide hormone that reduces appetite, increases libido, and is also responsible for increased skin pigmentation (27)

&gt; **Light as a central modulator of circadian rhythms, sleep and affect**
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; Irregular light environments lead to problems in circadian rhythms and sleep, which eventually cause mood and learning deficits. Recently, it was found that irregular light can also directly impact mood and learning without producing major disruptions in circadian rhythms and sleep.

&gt;
&gt;Between June 18 and Aug 3, 2020, we enrolled 76 participants to the two studies (38 in each study). In each study, nine volunteers received rAd26-S in phase 1, nine received rAd5-S in phase 1, and 20 received rAd26-S and rAd5-S in phase 2. Both vaccine formulations were safe and well tolerated. The most common adverse events were pain at injection site (44 [58%]), hyperthermia (38 [50%]), headache (32 [42%]), asthenia (21 [28%]), and muscle and joint pain (18 [24%]). Most adverse events were mild and no serious adverse events were detected. All participants produced antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein. At day 42, receptor binding domain-specific IgG titres were 14 703 with the frozen formulation and 11 143 with the lyophilised formulation, and neutralising antibodies were 49·25 with the frozen formulation and 45·95 with the lyophilised formulation, with a seroconversion rate of 100%. Cell-mediated responses were detected in all participants at day 28, with median cell proliferation of 2·5% CD4+ and 1·3% CD8+ with the frozen formulation, and a median cell proliferation of 1·3% CD4+ and 1·1% CD8+ with the lyophilised formulation.

As for the vaccine - you can fast track a lot of it. What you can’t fast track is finding out long-term effects (you can never reach long term conclusions from short term data). However long a vaccine is tested in humans for (and tracked, as in phase 3) is the limit of your knowledge.

We won’t know what it does at 4 months, 1 year, or 20 years. Does it increase likelihood of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (swine flu vaccine)? Or of intussusception in infants (rotashield vaccine)? Those examples are confirmed on the CDC website, btw, I’m not an anti-vaxxer conspiracy theorist. If the vaccine winds up using new MRNA tech rather than traditional vaccine techniques, the unknowns are significantly greater. 

There have been *many* horrific consequences of vaccines and drugs (I include this higher risk group because using a brand new vaccine tech is higher risk than tried-and-true tech) that have only been discovered and confirmed after years. 

I’m not at all saying not to get it, just that none of the things you mentioned 

- spend money and resources to quickly enroll lots of volunteers
- manufacture vaccines at a loss with the hopes it passes 
- run multiple trials at once
- deliberately target hot spots 

can in any way address this issue: what effects, if any, does it cause 6 months out? A year out? 6 years?

I hope we get a vaccine soon, but I think it’s important to understand the risk involved.

I can’t find info for the Pfizer one, but for the Moderna Phase 3, I’m a bit concerned that they are not including asymptomatic cases, especially given recent research that suggests even asymptomatic cases can cause long term damage (https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-19-can-wreck-your-heart-even-if-you-havent-had-any-symptoms/)

They have to meet a certain efficacy threshold. How a study defines “getting COVID” will certainly affect that. This definition certainly gets them to that 50% a lot faster, even though we’re now seeing that someone can be less sick than this and end up with long term damage.

&gt; **Primary Efficacy Endpoint: COVID-19 Disease Case Definition**

&gt; To be considered a case of COVID-19 for the evaluation of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint, two criteria must be met:
&gt; 1. The participant must have experienced 
&gt;      - At least TWO of the following systemic symptoms: fever (≥ 38oC), chills, myalgia, headache, sore throat, new olfactory and taste disorder(s)
&gt;    OR
&gt;      - At least ONE of the following respiratory signs/symptoms: cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, OR clinical or radiographical evidence of pneumonia

&gt; AND
             
&gt; 2. The participant must have at least one NP swab, nasal swab or saliva sample (or respiratory sample, if hospitalized) positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR

Even though I think a 50% efficacy even based on this would help, emergency authorization for something like this really needs to be set to a higher standard.

**Saliva-based coronavirus test funded by NBA, NBPA gets emergency authorization from FDA**

**Cheap, frequent COVID tests could be ‘akin to vaccine,’ professor says**

[https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/08/cheap-daily-covid-tests-could-be-akin-to-vaccine/](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/08/cheap-daily-covid-tests-could-be-akin-to-vaccine/)

&amp;#x200B;

The strategy, if adopted and backed by the federal government, could put hundreds of millions of tests in the hands of consumers within weeks, at a cost far less than repeated rounds of economic stimulus, Mina said. **The tests, which can be produced for less than a dollar, can be performed by consumers each day or every other day. Though not as accurate as current diagnostic tests, they are nonetheless effective at detecting virus when a person is most infectious, Mina said. If everyone who tests positive stays home, he said, the widespread effect would be similar to that of a vaccine, breaking transmission chains across the country.**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So if the false positive rate is 2%: you could deploy tests wherever there is a significant number of infections (10/100k/week?)

false positives don't matter when the primary concern is do not share. and you're testing EVERYONE.

&amp;#x200B;

erring on the side of caution is PREFERRED.

&amp;#x200B;

unlike PCR (with days long turnaround).. you can spit test again.. and ""clear yourself"" to return to work/school - NBA practice facility after 2 consecutive negatives.

There's a reason that /r/COVID19 banned this site because of its tendency to sensationalize titles to the point of being *inaccurate*. If you didn't read the article: this is NOT -- I repeat, NOT -- evidence of long-term clinically significant damage.

There was a paper in one of the Nature family journals (maybe Nature med? I'll try to find it) several years back that showed similar (except worse) findings at 6-month follow-up after discharge from hospital in SARS patients; classic signs of restrictive lung disease 2/2 viral pneumonia and ARDS. These signs normalized in reasonably short order and, at regular follow ups as far as 12 years out (at which point the paper was published), they did not suffer from long-term clinical dysfunction -- it's been a little while since I've read it, but if I recall correctly, only one of them had signs of lung disease, which is actually *better* than the population as a whole at that age (leading one of my colleagues to humorously remark that that data appeared to suggest SARS was *protective* against lung disease).

On top of that, frankly, I'd be surprised if I *didn't* see significant recovery times in a sample where 20% of the patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. That's going to damage your lungs pretty significantly as well -- frankly, at that point, VAP and just straight-up trauma is probably going to be one of your bigger concerns.

Finally, as the article says -- a lot of this tissue damage *did not show up clinically*. That is, there was a degree of tissue damage determined from CT scans, but it did not actually have an impact on the patient -- it didn't lead to abnormal oxygenation, arrhythmia, symptoms in the patient, pulmonary function testing, or any of that. It was incidentally found on follow-up precisely because they were *looking* for it. Again, that's not unusual for recovery courses from pneumonia.

But that's beside the point that, again, experience with significantly more severe coronavirus family members (namely, SARS) and other viral pneumonias (or pneumonias in general) suggests that this will likely normalize over time. (As it clearly already has started to, from 0 weeks, when everyone would have had issues, to 6 weeks, and then to 12.)

TL;DR: EurekAlert remains clickbait, and the title is a lie. Read the actual study, and read up on other diseases to gain context.

Understandably, the response to the Covid‐19 pandemic has created huge changes for the whole UK population, and nurses have had to adapt to a number of changes to their working pattern. For some nurses, they have needed to stop working due to their own health concerns, or work remotely. For others, utterances of concern included: having to work in different settings; learning how to manage a ventilator; worries they have a serious illness; and fears they will pass on illness to vulnerable members of their family. A private social media page for healthcare workers reverberates several these concerns. Many members, especially nurses, comment having increased anxiety and even experienced panic attacks for the first time. Others have found that dormant Obsessive Compulsive Disorder symptoms had returned due to concerns about germ transmission. Others mentioned that they were considering a change in career, or retirement, postpandemic.

Vitamin D supplements can be easily purchased over the counter, in the form of ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol, in diverse formulations and dosages. The cases of hypervitaminosis D usually occur in excessive supplementation.(3,7,8) The upper limit of daily vitamin D intake needed to cause toxicity is unknown; however, up to 10,000IU per day was considered safe in a healthy population.(3)


The drug capsules were submitted to laboratory analysis due to suspected intoxication. The analytical methodology and specification used were based on the United States Pharmacopea (USP 34) Oil-soluble vitamins capsules, by means of high-performance liquid chromatography. The amount of vitamin D found was two-thousand-fold higher than expected for each capsule.

What makes you think any person who properly mitigates and quarantines does so entirely in a bedroom like LOFL, what?! You can exercise outside, swim outside, eat outside, social distance visit meaning 6 plus feet, masks etc outside. I’ve seen my family plenty since March through driveway visits at a safe distance or backyard dinners while they eat inside we eat on the deck and talk via a screen door at a distance, we hang out outside in a large outdoor backyard. There are ways; people just want to be stubborn and throw huge hissy fits like yourself because “wahhhhh, I want to eat INSIDE the restaurant, Daddy!” Grow up. Order carry out and eat it outside at a safer distance with friends or family. No one is saying to “stay inside,” with zero human contact unless that’s something a person decides they want or if they have immunocompromised/health issues and make that choice to protect themselves. 

Clearly the creativity of enjoying the new normal and coming up with innovative ways to follow all proper PPE, social distance and mitigation efforts is lacking on your end and shows the laziness that the globe is mocking Americans for. It’s called being mentally tough, creative and adapting. Again, life can carry on without being a dick about COVID and adjusting to the new normal.

If everyone was like me, we’d had gotten back to school without stress, been able to have restaurants, gyms and bars open with NO PROBLEM.

I had a really difficult labor &amp; delivery and then my baby had reflux and wouldn't sleep, just cried all the time. I went into a pretty bad spiral and literally no one noticed. I remember one time my sister came over to watch him and let me sleep and I just laid in my bed and cried for an hour, then pretended everything was fine. 

The hardest part is the way your brain tricks you into thinking you can't ask for help, or you're a bad mom (at least that was the case for me). I would push my husband away when he got home from work and tried to take over, because I was convinced that I was the only one who could take care of my baby (even though I was also convinced I was a total failure)

Anyway - for me I think it took probably 6-8 weeks before I asked for help. Then my family took turns coming over and giving me breaks. With my second and with this new baby I was prepared and talked to my doctor beforehand. I was able to get my husband's FMLA extended so that he was home to help longer, and my family knew that I might be struggling and checked in pretty frequently. 

PPD/PPA is definitely real and scary but don't let that put you off of having kids. Talk to your doctor and your partner and have a plan in place. For instance, with my most recent birth I wasn't sure if I would have the family support because of COVID so she had it in the chart that I could call and get a prescription of zoloft if I needed it.

If the working population reaches the actual herd immunity, 60, 70 or 80% or whatever it is, without broadly spreading to other populations, the other populations will be protected, and thus the “average” infection rate needed for herd immunity across the entire population would be much lower, like the 31%.

Not buying what they are selling personally, especially as in some countries multi-generational households are the norm, and in countries where is is not a norm, multi-generational households are on the rise.

These are the Zigizag Univ, Iraq study results.  The clinical trial link is above, and the detailed PDF report on the results is given below.  The study is significant because of how it relates to community transmission and infectivity, as well as for treatment (active and possibly prophylactic) across age groups (similar results across age groups).


This seems to be a very significant study - it showed the effect of ivermectin when given to families with an infected (RT-PCR positive test) member.  It reduced development of symptoms hugely.

From ""Follow up"" section in first few pages, one can see they tested RT-PCR for those who developed symptoms.  And they did CT scans for symptomatic and also recorded side-effects (side effects given in clinicaltrials link - gastro etc in a few who took ivermectin).

And there within 14 days only 7.4pct of close family members developed it for ivermectin vs 58.4pct for non-ivermectin group.  And the results were similar across age groups ie it helped them all.

In addition it reduced the infectivity period ie non-ivermectin group kept on infecting each other for longer.

Dosage was ivermectin was given at day 1 and day 3 (2 days) - each day the dose was the standard dose:

40-60kg person - 15mg per day
60-80kg person - 18mg per day
greater than 80kg - 24mg per day


You could say it was a prophylaxis plus suppression of nascent disease study - since when first family member was detected he may already have infected a few family members (usually large close-knit families).  The Iraqi family structure probably gives a heightened infection rate - if family numbers are larger will give a magnified result - but this helps the study give a more robust results (larger numbers) with fewer families (I think total families was 50 - ie index cases they tracked to families were 50).

Use of Ivermectin as a Prophylactic Option in Asymptomatic Family Close Contacts with Patients of COVID-19
Document date : 31-5-2020


Results

As regard index cases, there were 9 (11.8%) mild , 44 (57.9%) moderate and 23 (30.3%) severe cases. In the ivermectin group, there were 8 (53.3%) mild, 6 (40%) moderate and 1 (6.7%) severe cases. While in the no-intervention group, there were 31 (52.5) mild, 21 (35.6%) moderate and 7 (11.9%) cases.

Table (2): Comparison between Ivermectin arm and non-intervention
arm regarding outcome.

Table (2) shows that 15 contacts (7.4%) developed COVID-19 in the ivermectin arm compared to 59 (58.4%) in the no-intervention arm, all of them were symptomatic, according to the study protocol . The difference was highly significant (p&lt;0.001). The median (range) days for developing the disease was 2 (2-6) in ivermectin group compared and 4 (2-10) in the no-intervention group, the difference was significant (p&lt;0.017). 

Ten contacts (66.6%) developed symptoms in 1st 3 days in ivermectin group, and none developed it after 6 days. In the no-intervention arm, 25 (42.3%) developed symptoms in the 1st 3 days and continued to the 10 days.

HRCT of the chest was performed in 14 out 15 contacts and in 58 of the 59 contacts who developed symptoms in ivermectin and no-intervention groups, respectively. The missed one case in each arm had symptoms and positive RT-PCR without other investigations. Chest HRCT was positive for COVID-19 in 7 (50%) and 28 (48.3%) in ivermectin and no-intervention groups, respectively.  Complete blood count was performed also in 14 and 58 contacts who developed symptoms in ivermectin and no-intervention groups respectively.

Positive criteria in CBC was present in 12 (85.7%) and 53 (91.4%) in ivermectin and no-intervention groups respectively.

Table (3): Comparison between Ivermectin arm and non-intervention arm regarding protection rate stratified by basic characteristics.

Table (3) shows that 7.4% contacts developed diseases in ivermectin group while they were 58.4% in no-intervention group. Contacts tend to be infected when the index case was severe; 14.8% and 71.1% in both groups, respectively. The protection rate for ivermectin was more prominent in contacts less than 60 years old (6.2% infected compared to 58.7% if no intervention) , but still effective in elder than 60 years (16% infected compared to 55.6% if no intervention).",,1599463346,{},g4b7l3r,True,t3_io30w5,False,True,t3_io30w5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/io30w5/prophylactic_ivermectin_in_covid19_contacts/g4b7l3r/,1599463357,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

&gt; This webinar consists of a 24-minute presentation by Dr. Hollis, followed by 15 minutes of questions and answers. Hollis thoroughly explains how vitamin D supplementation is processed by both the endocrine and autocrine systems. He reviews clinical trials that have had success or failure and correlates their results with their dosing strategy. It is a very technical presentation, but if you don't yet understand why daily dosing is important, then please watch this webinar so that you can fully understand the importance of daily dosing.

[https://grassrootshealth.net/blog/daily-dosing/](https://grassrootshealth.net/blog/daily-dosing/)

&gt; # 1 – The Endocrine System – for skeletal health
&gt; 
&gt; Until recently, most research about vitamin D has revolved around the endocrine system which maintains bone health. Vitamin D, from UV exposure or diet, is delivered to the liver, converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin D, or 25(OH)D, and moved into circulation where it has a half-life of approximately three weeks.
&gt; 
&gt; As necessary, 25(OH)D is then transferred to the kidney where it is further converted to the active form of 1,25(OH)2D which has a half-life of only a few hours. This active form helps to control calcium absorption and bone health. All the successful studies on vitamin D and bone health have benefited from the long half-life and availability of 25(OH)D. For bone health, the important thing is the amount of 25(OH)D available, rather than direct intake of vitamin D.
&gt; 
&gt; Because of the three-week half-life, there is not a large difference between dosing every week, every 2 weeks, or 3 weeks. So, if we were only concerned about our skeletal system we could take vitamin D only once a month and it should provide benefits to bone health, but do we want more than that?
&gt; 
&gt; # 2 – The Autocrine/Paracrine System – for autoimmune health
&gt; 
&gt; What has not been appreciated until relatively recently is that in addition to being delivered to the liver for conversion to 25(OH)D, vitamin D is also delivered directly to all tissues of the body. Many of these tissues, such as breast, colon, prostate, and brain, can convert vitamin D to its active form within the tissue. It is through this process that vitamin D can help enable the cells to fight against infections, disease, and autoimmune disorders.
&gt; 
&gt; **Vitamin D has a half-life in the autocrine system of roughly 24 hours, so in order for it to have a meaningful impact on cellular functions, you need a new supply of it every day.** This new understanding means that frequency of dosing matters when testing for disease reduction and immune control – large monthly or quarterly doses that are effective for bone health are not likely to show positive results for disease reduction. For disease prevention and treatment, daily dosing (food, sun, and supplement) is very important!

They didn’t want to hear it, because the advise is don’t open schools, but if you have to open it’s going to cost a bit to at least minimize the airborne vector to the greatest extent possible. 

As an HVAC specialist, I would advise the schools to delay in person openings until the local weather was at least comfortable enough to economize (use outside air to cool spaces instead of recirculating the room air, this requires retrofits in some cases); open up every outside air damper they have to the fullest, even if it means degradation in performance; upgrade filters to MERV 13, add as many filtered circulating fans in every space that they can get their hands on. There are other more application specific things we can manipulate, but the idea is dilute and filter as much as possible. 

I’d also suggest reducing circulation of students if possible. Teachers moving with students staying in the same class would be best but probably not practical, but they could create a bell schedule specific for each grade where say the lower class moves at a quarter past the hour, the middle class moves at half past, the next class moves at a quarter til, and the upper on the hour. All the while ventilating the shit out of the common spaces. Sorry band, choir, and athletics.

Winter months should be worse: people will be driven inside; some people will have to choose between fogged up glasses and masks; breathing will lead to freezing on face.

I don't recall it ever being applied diseases we _didn't_ have a vaccine for.

For the many years we didn't have vaccines for measles, mumps, small pox, chicken pox, polio ... were people describing the situation as having ""herd immunity?""

I think it was more like we just lived with some level of infection because there wasn't really any other choice. Getting measles, mumps, chicken pox, was just something that happened to kids as they grew up. I don't recall anyone using ""herd-immunity"" when describing the situation.

I made sure to find a medication I could take throughout the pregnancy, and talked extensively about it with my doctors while I was pregnant. Making phone calls is tough for me, so I even made sure to write down the contact info for my OB, PCP, psychiatrist, and therapist just in case my husband had to call. Having a plan helped me feel more in control of a situation where you have almost no control. 

I did wind up getting it when I had baby #2, but my husband knew he had to keep an eye out for it so he called my team as soon as he saw that I was spiraling out of control.

Then let's say for the 7 days after that, it decides to go the other direction and increase its original testing ten fold for 7 days.  Now it does 100,000 tests a day and finds 10,000 cases.  

Imagine looking at those numbers over time as an observer.  Imagine you were only looking at case count.  Originally case count is 1,000 a day, then suddenly it drops to 100 a day for a week.  Looks like a massive improvement.  And then oh shit, now its 10,000 a day for this next week, wtf happened?  Must be having a massive outbreak now.

When people say that this vaccine is rushed and it normally takes many years to develop vaccines, they are correct but they forget history. The early vaccines like smallpox and rabies were so easy that a doctor could work for a few months and make a pretty rudimentary vaccine. Jenner (smallpox) and Pauster (rabies) both succeeded basically on their first attempt, despite having only 1800's knowledge. The hard problems that are left over, like HIV, are hard because the low hanging fruits had been picked centuries ago. Covid is a brand new virus, it could have been as easy as rabies or as hard as HIV, and so far it looks like we got very lucky and it is going to be one of the easier ones (at the very least, way easier than SARS1, where animals suffered massive allergic reactions to the first vaccine candidate. The animal experiment part of the Covid vaccine went really well.) The vaccines we talk about in recent years and takes decades of research are the toughest nuts to crack, they are not typical of the disease world.

Modern vaccines are created in such a way that safety is verified first, efficacy second. The first batch of Covid vaccine candidates already passed safety trials, the side effects were the typical redness at injection site and arm soreness. I'd feel comfortable receiving the first vaccines because the potential long term complications with this type of vaccine are extremely rare (one type of influenza vaccine was weakly linked to a type of facial nerve problem, one type of H1N1 vaccine was linked to sleep disorders, there are no other long term issues that I have heard of). Live vaccine are much more risky, I would be pretty hesitant to get a rushed live vaccine, but Covid is so dangerous that no one is trying to make a live vaccine for it, especially now that it looks like the safe options are going to work.

The ""five year"" timespan you mentioned also have another aspect. Normally, we develop vaccines for diseases that have a certain ""encounter rate"". It normally takes year(s) for enough vaccinated volunteer to encounter the disease and generate evidence of vaccine effectiveness. Covid is spreading so quickly in some areas of the world that this process is greatly accelerated. In that sense, the vaccine is not rushed, the evidence is just being generated at a much faster rate than other vaccination efforts.",,1599517914,{},g4dvqsw,False,t3_inmcaa,False,True,t1_g48uifv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/inmcaa/daily_discussion_post_september_06_questions/g4dvqsw/,1599521407,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Even if they have a medical exemption (one that apparently does not prevent them from spouting off like idiots for an hour, and I doubt since what are odds both of them have a medical exemption that prevents both of them from wearing one...considering many medical conditions only make it more important to wear one AND he can apparently still smoke) I am certain there is no constitutional right to ride a ferry...

&gt; A Brooklyn couple was pulled from a city ferry in handcuffs on Saturday night after refusing the captain's order to wear a mask or leave the boat. The husband and wife, who were headed home to Bay Ridge after a night in Manhattan, each received a summons for disorderly conduct, according to an NYPD spokesperson.

&gt; For more than an hour on Saturday, the middle-aged duo stood defiantly on the top deck of an NYC Ferry, rejecting the captain's orders to disembark at Brooklyn Bridge Park around 8 p.m. 

&gt; They insisted they had a constitutional right to ride mask-free, claiming they both suffered from a medical condition exempting them from Governor Andrew Cuomo’s requirement that New Yorkers wear a face covering in public to stop the spread of coronavirus.

&gt; “These people are just doing what the government is telling them,” the woman said of the masked riders aboard the boat.

&gt; When the two police officers arrived, roughly 45 minutes after the ferry standoff started, the couple presented their case that the captain had unfairly singled them out.

&gt; ""He's shaming us,"" said the man, who identified himself only as David (a police spokesperson declined to provide their full names).""Because we can't wear a mask, we're being discriminated against.""

&gt; His wife went a step further, suggesting that they were specifically targeted because they are white. ""If we were fucking Black, I can guarantee you that guy would never come out and tell us put a mask on,"" she huffed to a Gothamist reporter.

&gt; “Right, because Black Lives Matter,” the husband agreed.

...

&gt; As the cops walked the couple off the pier, David requested a cigarette — which the cops permitted — and lamented why the officers weren’t focused on the “homeless drug addicts and looters.”

&gt; “Can one of you guys give us a ride home please? We feel so good about the NYPD,” he added.

&gt;The cops explained it was against the rules, and eventually placed the husband and wife in the back of a police van.

To make that claim, you need a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Preferably a few of them with the same results. That's the standard of evidence required to dictate standard of care. Now let's look at your sources:

1) Shady FB post. What the hell lol. 

2) A letter to the editor with a hypothesis. Not a trial. And the paper you refrence has.. big surprise, been retracted until further notice due to flaws 

So... already, we have made it through Feb., and you have not been able to site any evidence that we ""knew about VD"". There are hundreds of hypotheses for different compounds out there. If I used your standard for evidence at this point, I could make an argument just as strong for any of them. But let's keep going:

3) Not a trial, just a review with further hypothesis formulation. This is a call for further studies, and makes some problematic claims. See the rebutal [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7352999/). 

4) This is an observational study. It should not need to be said that correlation is not equal to causation. There are 1,000 different possible explanaitons for this relationship. Again, this a reason to perform an actual trial, it is absolutely NOT evidence that VD supplementation is efficacious in acute management of COVID-19. 

So... if you are making the claim that we should conduct proper studies, I support that. It seems there is some good hypotheses out there and some okay observational data. However, if you are making the claim that VD is useful in acute management of C19, there is absolutely not enough evidence to say that. It's absurd to go around saying ""we knew about VD in Feb"" when your Feb source is literally an FB post.

When people say that this vaccine is rushed and it normally takes many years to develop vaccines, they are kinda correct but they forget history. The early vaccines like smallpox and rabies were so easy that a doctor could work for a few months and make a very rudimentary vaccine. Jenner (smallpox) and Pauster (rabies) both succeeded basically on their first attempt, despite having only 1800's knowledge. The hard problems that are left over, like HIV, are hard because the low hanging fruits had been picked centuries ago. Covid is a brand-new virus, it could have been as easy as rabies or as hard as HIV, and so far it looks like we got very lucky and it is going to be one of the easier ones (at the very least, way easier than SARS1, where animals suffered massive allergic reactions to the first vaccine candidate. The animal experiment part of the Covid vaccine went really well.) The vaccines we talk about in recent years and takes decades of research are the toughest nuts to crack, they are not typical of the disease world.

Modern vaccines are created in such a way that safety is verified first, efficacy second. The first batch of Covid vaccine candidates already passed safety trials, the side effects were the typical redness at injection site and arm soreness. I'd feel comfortable receiving the first vaccines because the potential long term complications with this type of vaccine are extremely rare (one type of influenza vaccine was weakly linked to a type of facial nerve problem, one type of H1N1 vaccine was linked to sleep disorders, there are no other long term issues that I have heard of). Live vaccine are much more risky, I would be pretty hesitant to get a rushed live vaccine, but Covid is so dangerous that no one is trying to make a live vaccine for it, especially now that it looks like the safe options are going to work.

The ""four year"" timespan your family mentioned also have another aspect. Normally, we develop vaccines for diseases that have a certain ""encounter rate"". It normally takes years for enough vaccinated volunteer to encounter the disease and generate evidence of vaccine effectiveness. Covid is spreading so quickly in some areas of the world that this process is greatly accelerated. In that sense, the vaccine trial is not rushed, the evidence is just being generated at a much faster rate than other vaccination efforts.",,1599517710,{},g4dve9k,False,t3_inmcaa,False,True,t1_g491dk9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/inmcaa/daily_discussion_post_september_06_questions/g4dve9k/,1599521226,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

My company has three brick and mortar offices in my metro area. Two of them are closing out right. The last one is going from occupying four floors of an expensive commercial real estate building down to half of a single floor and that's only for essential offices for people that require an office location to lock up files and things of that nature. 

My company is certainly not alone in this. I work in the tech sector, and my metro area is heavily tech oriented. I have peers and friends across multiple companies and it's happening in every single one. I expect traditional commercial office space here to emerge from this with about 25% of the occupancy than it had going in, and I don't expect the other 75% to come back when there's a vaccine. Companies have realized that they can squeeze a lot more margin out of their products and productivity out of their workers without the boat anchor drag of commercial office space.

What is surprising is the utter void of conversation about what to do with these newly abandoned commercial properties. With any disaster, there is also a great deal of opportunity to be had.

I just had a negative Covid test 3 days ago though, and like I said, I had it back in April so the chances of still/again having it are slim to none. Most likely my lungs were just damaged and being immunocompromised, I probably picked up some mild viral pneumonia from a patient and my now damaged lungs do not like. 


In your case, sorry to hear you’re having what seems to be cardiac problems. Very glad you are seeing cardiology this month. I wish there were more answers. If your breathing feels fine I wouldn’t worry too much about your lungs.

If we vaccinate with imperfect efficiency (which is all we can expect) and low uptake (which we may be able to improve on) we will reduce the opportunity for the virus to be transmitted significantly. However, if we go back to February 2020 behavior, that reduction may still not be enough to prevent each infected person from infecting &gt;1 new person.

If that happens, the unprotected segment of the population is vulnerable to a pandemic with exponential growth (but with a declining rate of transmission) until around 75% of the population is immune, after which the virus will run out of new hosts to infect and decline fairly rapidly.

I wish I could be with her without the need for some sort of legal recognition of our relationship, but that's the world we live in: unavoidable issues like taxes and death.

To give some context: I met her on Reddit. She's Finnish, and at the time, I had just gotten out of a long-distance relationship, so we were talking as friends for a year before we even got romantic. She was (is) my best friend.

Over time feelings developed and we decided we should see if we can make things work, so we started traveling to see each-other.

We traveled back and forth several times, taking advantage of 3 month travel visas, and finding work that would accommodate the travel. At the end of the day, however, there was a ticking clock on our relationship. Each time we crossed the border, we risked the visa being rejected, and it started getting to the point that the border guards would restrict our travel (you can't just spend half a year in a foreign country on several tourist visas)

Basically, if we wanted to have a future together we had to get married.

Foreign people can't just stay here permanently because they love someone - they have to be married under a visa process (K1 visa) which was all bullshit. We did everything right, and over the span of 2 years we finally managed to get everything together and approved, and even still border guards continued to harass us (making my wife cry through interrogation), and paying thousands of dollars to process the applications.

Either way, once she was approved, we had 90 days from her entry into the US to get married, or else she'd never be allowed back. This was (unfortunately) in between work that required me to travel, so our wedding day was landing in the US where I lived (Massachusetts) driving to the closest state with a same-day marriage license, and got married in a park by a judge we called the day before. We drove home together for the first time,I dropped her off, and I went to work.

&gt; which means, you don't value their earthly life. that's it. that's the end result of that logic.
