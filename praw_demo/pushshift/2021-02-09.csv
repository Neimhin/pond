[],,MameJenny,,,[],,,,text,t2_gl7wc,False,False,[],"If all of the available vaccines (plus natural immunity) had zero effect on symptoms, transmission, *and* severe disease, yeah that could be possible. 

The good news is that we already have pretty good evidence that worst-case isn’t playing out in the near-term future. Even if a vaccine gets dropped to, say, 60% or 70% efficacy (in the realm of what we’ve seen from J&amp;J and Novavax), we’re not going to see exponential growth. People won’t be spreading it to 3-4 people, since half those people are immune. It’ll be more of a gradual effect of that variant becoming dominant as it spreads to ~1 other person. 

It’s also important to note that a big reason COVID-19 was so severe is that we have minimal existing immunity to it. The flu mutates enough to render vaccines ineffective every few months, but we’re not in a constant Spanish Flu. That’s mainly because people have already encountered the disease as a population. So instead of widespread severe illness each time, people have a week or two of illness at the most. Vaccines have a similar effect - we’re introducing people’s bodies to the concept called “coronavirus” without causing disease. It’s pretty likely COVID-19 will go the same direction. 

I can tell you’re a little bit like I am, always thinking of the worst-case. I encourage you to take a little break from social media and news for a few days. Reassurance will help, but it’s really important to keep a healthy distance from this stuff too. :)",,,1612927636,{},gms0717,False,t3_lfxpir,False,False,t1_gmrz4ub,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gms0717/,1612940594,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Of course if one dose prevents infection altogether (produces sterilizing immunity in some people), then it could still reduce overall transmission. However, the problem of having the virus replicating inside individuals with antibodies would seem to outweigh the possibility of an escape mutant forming in an unvaccinated individual and then being transferred to others who have been vaccinated. I think that's what these scientists are worried about.

&gt;dropping prevalence as quickly as possible would be the best way to prevent another such mutation.

I certainly agree with this as does this article:

&gt;But for Paul Bieniasz, the ideal approach would be to use interventions such as social distancing as a means of reducing viral transmission before deploying vaccines, to avoid the risk of stimulating escape variants. 
&gt;
&gt;“Get the virus clamped down, then vaccinate your population,” he says. 

Unfortunately for countries like the UK and the US, this is not really feasible at the moment even though infections were dropping before the vaccines could have had an effect. Overall, I'd say we're just taking our chances because escape mutations are rare, and it seems like our only choice.

There were countless vaccine conspiracy theories with hundreds of up votes each.  I actually had to scroll down to see a post from someone not absolutely insane.

There were the usual claims. Like that the vaccine contains a tracking device and a bunch of Trump nuts posting nonsense about him intentionally delaying the vaccine because he knew it was bad, but one highly upvoted post was all about how the vaccine is being used to sterilize white men.

I know these nutjobs are louder than sane people, but it's still extremely depressing to see so much of it. The whole ""vaccine is being used to sterilize white men"" conspiracy theory is one I can see taking hold. Now that Trump is gone a bunch of these nutjobs need something else to grab ahold of. There's nothing they love more than claiming white men are being attacked, so I fully expect that bullshit to spread.

The worst part is that herd immunity will eventually keep these morons from getting covid. Since they're far too stupid to ever grasp that they'll claim that the vaccine was never needed.

Abstract  
This study analyzes the impact of COVID-19 deniers on the spread of COVID-19 in Germany. In a first step, we establish a link between regional proxies of COVID-19 deniers and infection rates. We then estimate the causal impact of large anti-lockdown protests on the spread of COVID-19 using an event study framework. Employing novel data on bus stops of travel companies specialized in driving protesters to these gatherings, and exploiting the timing of two large-scale demonstrations in November 2020, we find sizable increases in infection rates in protesters' origin regions after these demonstrations. Individual-level evidence supports the main results by documenting that COVID-19 deniers engage less in health protection behavior. Our results contribute to the debate about the public health costs of individual behavior that has detrimental externalities for the society.",,,1612943580,{},gmsngku,True,t3_lgoscg,False,True,t3_lgoscg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lgoscg/german_study_finds_that_antilockdown_protests/gmsngku/,1612951326,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; “I think it started in China,” Professor Dwyer told Nine News. “I think the evidence for it starting elsewhere in the world is actually very limited. There is some evidence but it’s not really very good.”

&gt; Professor Dwyer, who is in hotel quarantine in Sydney after flying back from China on Wednesday, said the “most likely source” is that the virus came from bats before another animal such as a cat passed it on to humans.

&gt; “I think the explosion in the market in Wuhan was really an amplifying event. The virus had probably been circulating [in the community] for some good few weeks beforehand,” he said.

&gt; “The results aren’t definitive like people would expect, but that was never going to happen,” he said.",,,1612953251,{},gmsxgt8,True,t3_lgqygw,False,False,t3_lgqygw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lgqygw/australian_scientist_on_who_mission_confident/gmsxgt8/,1612955969,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/10/world/covid-19-coronavirus#us-coronavirus-deaths-though-still-high-have-seen-a-sustained-decline

&gt;Coronavirus-related deaths, which rose sharply in the United States beginning in November and remain high, appear to be in a steady decline, following in the tracks of new virus cases and hospitalizations, which began to drop last month.

&gt;The country has reported about 2,800 deaths a day recently, an average that excludes one anomalous day last week when Indiana announced a large number of backlogged death reports. That national average remains far above the level of early November, before the country’s recent surge, when roughly 825 deaths were being reported daily. But it is down significantly from the peak just a few weeks ago, when the average was more than 3,300 a day.

&gt;New coronavirus cases are a leading indicator for deaths, and that statistic has been improving markedly for a month. On Tuesday, the country reported 96,400 new cases, the third day in a row of having fewer than 100,000 new recorded cases, a level not seen since early November.

&gt;The seven-day average of new cases, a more reliable indicator of the pandemic’s direction, has fallen more than 50 percent since it peaked on Jan. 8.

&gt;Whether that will continue remains in doubt. Researchers warn that a more contagious virus variant first found in Britain is doubling roughly every 10 days in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautioned last month that it could become the dominant variant in the nation by March.

&gt;Deaths tend to lag behind new cases by several weeks, and the day-to-day statistics can be prone to reporting vagaries. For a while, it was hard to discern clear signs that deaths had begun to decline. But the national trend now is unmistakable: The daily average has dropped about 18 percent since Jan. 12.

&gt;Although deaths are still rising in some states, including Alabama and South Carolina, far more are reporting sustained declines. Over the past two weeks, reports of virus deaths have dropped more than 40 percent in New Mexico and more than 30 percent in Arkansas, Colorado and Connecticut.

&gt;The declines are heartening but are not a reason for people to let down their guard, said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist and associate professor at Harvard.

&gt;Dr. Hanage said the surges in new cases and deaths in December and early January had probably stemmed from the increase in gatherings over the holidays and from the onset of winter. Most kinds of coronavirus infections, including influenza, peak during winter, and there is little reason to think that Covid-19 is any different.

&gt;The more infectious nature of the Covid-19 virus, and the appearance of variants that may spread even more easily, remain a significant cause for caution, he said.

&gt;”If in response to these dropping numbers people relax, then it is entirely possible and expected that we will see that decline start to bottom out and even start to increase again,” he said.

&gt;A New York Times analysis found that about half of the country’s roughly 465,000 Covid-19 deaths have occurred since the brutal surge began in November.

Long associated with core values of many of the world's religions, these ideas are, nonetheless, relative newcomers to the lexicon of public health interventions.

Or this one from [Stanford University](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2016/05/promoting-abstinence-fidelity-for-hiv-prevention-is-ineffective.html):

&gt;The U.S. government has invested $1.4 billion in HIV prevention programs that promote sexual abstinence and marital fidelity, but there is no evidence that these programs have been effective at changing sexual behavior and reducing HIV risk, according to a new Stanford University School of Medicine study.

&gt;Since 2004, the U.S. President’s Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR, has supported local initiatives that encourage men and women to limit their number of sexual partners and delay their first sexual experience and, in the process, help to reduce the number of teen pregnancies.

&gt;A mutant strain of the new coronavirus that was discovered in the United Kingdom and is spreading in Japan. A foreign reporter working at Reuters' Tokyo branch was attending a party without responding to a request for health observation (waiting at home) for two weeks after returning from the UK, according to an interview with Shukan Bunshun. .. According to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the reporter has been infected with corona and party participants have been confirmed to be infected with the mutant strain.  
&gt;  
&gt;Reuters reporter A took a vacation in mid-December and returned to England temporarily. When I returned to Japan on December 22nd and had a PCR test at the airport, the result was negative.  
&gt;  
&gt;The incubation period of the corona is estimated to be about 14 days at the maximum, and the Japanese government will observe the health for two weeks (waiting at home) and health condition from the day after the day of entry in case of misjudgment or onset later. I am requesting a report.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, the reporter attended a party with nine friends at a pub in Minato Ward on December 25th.  
&gt;  
&gt;After that, a male friend who was attending the party and Mr. A's fiancé who did not attend the party developed the disease from the end of the year to the beginning of the year. After undergoing a formal test, all three were confirmed positive. Two of Mr. A's close contacts were found to have been infected with the mutant strain of corona. However, no mutant strain was detected in Mr. A. The person in charge of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare's New Coronavirus Infectious Disease Control Promotion Headquarters will supplement.  
&gt;  
&gt;""When I followed the infection route of the man who was first found to be infected (Editor's note: a friend of a party participant), I found a man (Mr. A) who entered the country from the United Kingdom. I took the sample again, but the amount of virus examined was too small to detect the mutant strain. Based on the situational evidence, it is estimated that two men were infected.

It sounds implausible, and yet, this is what scores of people are saying that they are experiencing. It is unethical not to take these claims seriously enough to investigate them, and calling them ""ridiculous"" is very much a step in the wrong direction.

Just so we're clear, ""mild"" in every instance I've used it, and generally how the medical community uses it, is any case of Covid that falls short of requiring hospitalization. Many of these patients probably did have an unpleasant bout with Covid, and I have never said that their long haul symptoms are ""worse,"" just that they are long-lasting and in many cases life-altering.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And no, we can do much better than survey. Because if these are such debilitating life changing issues they would not be out of the realm of the medical community and these people would be seeking medical attention often. Again it would be extremely obvious on an international scale.

How many hundreds of articles need to be written about long covid, providing accounts from as many patients, for it to be enough that you deem it ""extremely obvious on an international scale""?

All that is required is to send money, especially that a certain deadbeat country send money and that another, perhaps worse, country cease to take advantage of a program that isn't designed for its convenience and reverse its theft - and hopefully understand its guilt and offer compensation. 

Not only is there no physical diversion of a single 0,000000001 ml of vaccine, the transfer of money in the modern world involves physical transportation of absolutely NOTHING. 

Spite is a natural human vice, and it is unfortunately more common in some countries than others because of unrelenting social pressure and often quite widespread deliberate mendacious propaganda. So, if you wish to see the facts of what is proposed see the following. If spouting slogans that have no basis in reality is more comforting, well continue to blind yourself. There is ignorance, and then there is deliberate ignorance. Spite, as low a motivation as it is, has its compensations. Even if the actions carried out because of spite hurt the spiteful the spiteful will deliberately BLIND themselves to that FACT.

Similarly, to you, I was looking forward to him relocating from Ohio to NC  to live within minutes of me.  We had plans to enjoy weekly dinners together and beach trips and just getting to enjoy being in the same zip code for the first time since we were kids. It was such a happy time planning with lots of laughs and we were both excited. He was making final preparations for the move and had accepted  a new job with great pay, but a recent divorce and years of employer budget cuts that had reduced his salary by 50% and left him with nothing in his bank account, no health insurance and a disconnected cell phone. What he did have was too much pride to tell his kid sister (I was 42yrs old) that he couldn't afford his phone or his cardiologist appointments.  He died in his car one morning. He was alone, trapped, unable to get out after his car had drifted off the road into heavy underbrush after his heart arythmia caused a sudden loss of consciousness. He hadn't taken his cell phone with him because he didn't think it work. He was found dead, 8 hours later, with signs that he'd desperately tried to back his car out, force the door, crawl out. His implanted heart monitor documented the arythmia and the obvious stress and strain and fear as he died. 
I missed my dad after he died and I missed my mom but I grieve the loss of brother.

There is a critical global need for therapeutic intervention strategies that can be deployed to safely treat COVID-19 disease and reduce associated morbidity and mortality. Increasing evidence shows that both natural and synthetic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), also referred to as Host Defense Proteins/Peptides (HDPs), can inhibit SARS-CoV-2, paving the way for the potential clinical use of these molecules as therapeutic options. In this manuscript, we describe the potent antiviral activity exerted by brilacidin—a de novo designed synthetic small molecule that captures the biological properties of HDPs—on SARS-CoV-2 in a human lung cell line (Calu-3) and a monkey cell line (Vero). These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in these cell culture models is likely to be a result of the impact of brilacidin on viral entry and its disruption of viral integrity. Brilacidin demonstrated synergistic antiviral activity when combined with remdesivir. Collectively, our data demonstrate that brilacidin exerts potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 against different strains of the virus in cell culture.",,,1612924995,{},gmrv7v1,True,t3_lgk1aj,False,True,t3_lgk1aj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lgk1aj/brilacidin_demonstrates_inhibition_of_sarscov2_in/gmrv7v1/,1612938189,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I personally don’t think the average elderly person is 270x less likely go get exposed to the virus, do you? That’s quite a insane number. 

If any state vaccinates any normal/non immune deficient people in the 20-49 range before 70+, in my opinion they will have basically sacrificed the elderly for PR. 

It is certainly ironic, a year of telling people that they are grandma killers for
wanting slightly less restrictions on normal life, and the “well they can isolate, the government can help them do that” was seen as a unreasonable ask. 

Nearly a year later, we have a simple vaccine and it’s time to start actually avoiding death, and people want to give it to the people who cry the hardest not the ones who actually have a real chance of dying, and probably want to live a normal life now in the years they have left. There’s not even a trade off this time. It’s just who to offer a shot.

I started contingency planning that afternoon.  


We spent weeks dragging ancient laptops that were long overdue for recycling off shelves, swapping parts to make them work, inventorying loaners for programs that had no budget for new machines, lending machines between departments, beefing up our VPN, training on Microsoft Teams and the like...  


Then the weeks of people coming in to get these machines. Before masking. It didn't occur to me until halfway through how much of a risk it was - people working with the public all over the state coming to one place, to one of three people, to get set up with a laptop.  


  
So much has changed. We couldn't get equipment, everything was backordered - we had staff trying to help clients use various videoconferencing services. It was intense. It still doesn't feel real. I'm home right now working. It still doesn't feel real. I still don't know how we managed to keep everyone working.   


  
Man, I still remember we deployed Teams to the entire organization - \~500 staff - at the end of 2019. In early January, before we knew this was really coming, I was in front of 70 people and excitedly talking about and demoing Teams - how we don't need to travel everywhere for every meeting, how we could work together on documents, share things more easily. And how many blank stares there were. One man raising his hand ""I don't get what any of us would use this for."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I guess that was a good decision and I guess we got our answer.

But it was never just the cold war. Virtually every minor disagreement between world powers, even in modern times, is presented in such as way as to make people think we're on the brink of global war.

I really hope that I'm misreading this, and you're not accusing me of thinking that climate change is unnecessary fearmongering.

Climate change isn't really that hard to grasp at all, which is why children are so worried about it. What is hard to grasp, for some people, is why they should be worried about the new thing, when all the old things they were told to worry about turned out to be non-issues or easily solvable. There's even a certain section of the population who were told that they were heading towards a new ice age.

First of all, Daszak is a zoologist, not a virologist. His research is on impact of epidemic at the population level (disease ecology), not molecular mechanism of viral infections. While I don't think he is in any way involved in any Chinese conspiracy, it is very disingenuous to say he is a virologist, nor to imply that he is knowledgeable or privy to bio-weapon engineering. And I don't think appeal to authority is a good argument here.

&gt;We are also not at a point where we could have predicted that the virus would have behaved this way in 2019 just based on its sequence. 

we are certainly far from being able to predict. As such, it is asinine  claim that it is impossible to engineer, either by intention or by accident. I don't understand the problem of examining this issue more critically through independent verification, especially considering the behavior of the Chinese government. Why can't we have people who are actual experts in molecular virology and engineering of bio-weapon to examine the evidence?

&gt;Moreover, the lab published sequences of all the viruses it had collected and SARS-CoV-2 was not in those sequences. So for them to have not published it suggests that they knew it was going to leak and covered their tracks before the accident, which defies all logic.

to be honest, I don't trust transparency of the lab after repeated denial of access.

The Mainz-based pharmaceutical company Biontech has started vaccine production in its new production facility in Marburg, Hesse. In total, Biontech has three production facilities in Germany.

Biontech has started the first step towards vaccine production in Marburg, Hesse. The Mainz-based company took over the plant from the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis in September and converted it. Now Biontech began to manufacture the mRNA, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the Pfizer Biontech vaccine. As soon as the new plant is fully operational, it will be one of the largest mRNA production facilities in Europe with an annual capacity of up to 750 million doses, Biontech announced. The company plans to produce up to 250 million cans there in the first half of 2021.

A single batch of the mRNA active ingredient is enough for the production of eight million vaccine doses, the company announced on Wednesday in Mainz. The Hessian authorities approved production in Marburg around four weeks ago.

In order to enable the production of the finished vaccine, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) still has to approve the production processes of the new systems, explained Biontech. The necessary data and other necessary information will be submitted in February and March.

First finished vaccines from the beginning of April
After the approval by the EMA, according to Biontech, the first batches of the finished vaccine will be delivered to the partner locations for sterile filling. Then it will be distributed to the vaccination centers in accordance with the agreed agreements with the governments. The first vaccines manufactured in Marburg are expected to be delivered in early April.

Biontech is working with its US partner company Pfizer to meet global demand. The production capacity for the Covid-19 vaccine for 2021 has been increased to up to two billion doses. To do this, Biontech works with various partners.

The Bavarian pharmaceutical company Dermapharm, for example, wants to manufacture the COVID-19 vaccine from Biontech and Pfizer at a second location in Germany from May. Dermapharm has been manufacturing this in Brehna near Leipzig since October and is currently preparing for production in Reinbek near Hamburg. ""We're trying to start in May,"" said CEO Hans-Georg Feldmeier of the Reuters news agency in an interview published on Tuesday. ""The big advantage is that we can transfer our know-how from one location to the other."" That'll speed things up. The vaccine production in Reinbek should be even larger than that in Brehna.

According to Feldmeier, the two locations are part of a production network of 13 locations, including large pharmaceutical companies such as Novartis and Sanofi, which Biontech / Pfizer commissioned to achieve the two partners' production target of two billion vaccine doses this year. Dermapharm manufactured a ""significant proportion"" of the 50 million doses of the vaccine last year, he said, and is doubling its capacity to help the two companies ship an additional 75 million doses to the European Union in the second quarter.

""Completely new dimensions""
Dermapharm had no previous experience in vaccine production, but had internal experts in-house for coating the mRNA in the Biontech vaccine with lipids. ""That was the bridge that led us to Biontech,"" said Feldmeier. Lipids protect the messenger RNA (mRNA), which transmits the information to produce the antigen to the body, from being broken down and help to ensure that it reaches the cells. Feldmeier compared the lipids with lithium-ion batteries that are required for electric cars. ""You could actually build a lot more cars if there were more lithium-ion batteries,"" he said. The main bottleneck for production is expanding a previous niche technology and duplicating it at several locations. ""Now there is an upscaling in completely new dimensions.""

The US company Baxter also plans to soon produce vaccination doses from BioNTech and Pfizer in Halle, Westphalia. ""The plan is that we will start production of BioNTech vaccines at the end of February / beginning of March,"" said HR manager Jürgen Fleischer in mid-January of the Reuters news agency, without giving any figures. However, it is said to be an order in the three-digit million range for vaccination doses, which is to be processed within 18 months.

At the end of January, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis announced that it would be helping Biontech with the filling process from the second quarter.

French pharmaceutical company Sanofi also wants to manufacture more than 125 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by competitors Biontech and Pfizer for the European Union. The first deliveries from the Sanofi production facilities in Frankfurt are expected in the summer, the company said at the end of January. Sanofi will give Biontech access to its production infrastructure and take over late-stage manufacturing steps. A facility is to be used for this, in which Sanofi previously produced diabetes medication.",,,1612955714,{},gmt01nu,True,t3_lgrjj2,False,True,t3_lgrjj2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lgrjj2/biontech_starts_covid19_vaccine_production_in/gmt01nu/,1612957146,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

She added: “These guidelines that are being released today are very, very important, because the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is one of the main vaccines at this point in the Covax facility — it’s going to be procured in hundreds of millions of doses, and distributed around the world.

“And so many countries will be receiving their first tranches of the vaccine from the Covax facility later in February.

“This is one of those vaccines which can be stored in ordinary refrigerator temperatures, and therefore it’s going to be very useful for a large number of countries with different situations on the ground so logistically, it’s easier to use.”

Shares in the London-listed company AstraZeneca dropped heavily after the announcement, losing 1.3 prt vrny of their value and wiping around £1.2 billion off its stock market valuation in just half an hour.

“However, the results of the efficacy estimate for persons up to 65 and older, had a wide confidence interval. And therefore we feel that the response of this group cannot be any different to groups that are of a younger age.

“Since we have identified people over 65 was one of our priority groups in the prioritisation roadmap... looking at the safety and immunogenicity data... we recommend for the vaccine to be used in people 18 years and above, without an upper age limit.

“That means people over 65 years of age should be given the vaccination.”

**HSE plans**

Ireland revised vaccine rollout plans last week after deciding not to give the AstraZeneca jab to ove 65s but to use the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines only.

HSE chief executive Paul Reid said on Sunday the decision to change plans and not to use the AstraZeneca vaccine for the over-70 age group was likely to delay the completion of the process by only a couple of weeks. He said all those over 70 should receive their first dose of the vaccine by mid-April and their second by mid-May.

Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said on Sunday the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines had a superior effectiveness and were considered to be more appropriate for people over 70. The first batch of AstraZeneca vaccines, which arrived in the State at the weekend, were due to be given to healthcare workers this week.

The Oxford jab is an important vaccine for the global supply.

The jab is easier to transport than some of the other Covid-19 jabs because it does not need to be stored at ultra-low temperatures.

**Not-for-profit**

Meanwhile the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca have said that they will provide the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic across the world, and “in perpetuity” to low and middle-income countries.

Dr Soumya Swaminathan, the WHO’s chief scientist, said the guidance was an “important milestone”.",,,1612974954,{},gmtyvb9,True,t3_lgxhl1,False,True,t1_gmtys42,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lgxhl1/who_recommends_wide_use_of_astrazeneca_vaccine/gmtyvb9/,1612987971,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

**Some countries, including Ireland, opted not to give the jab to older age groups**

Scientists advising the World Health Organisation (WHO) have recommended the use of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine in all adults.

WHO scientists have issued interim recommendations on the vaccine, saying that the jab could be given people aged 18 and above “without an upper age limit”.

It comes after a number of countries, including Ireland have opted not to give the jab to those over the age of 65, due to a lack of trial data on this age cohort.

The WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation — also known as Sage — also said that the jab should be given in two doses — with the second dose delivered between four and 12 weeks after the first.

But Dr Alejandro Cravioto, chairman of the advisory group, told a press briefing that the window of eight to 12 weeks was “the best time” to give a second dose because the delay produces a “much better immune response”.

He said: “We had a long review of the evidence, talked to the experts and the people who are directly involved with a trial.

“Based on the current evidence, Sage recommends that these vaccines should be administered in two doses of half a millilitre each with an interval of between four and 12 weeks between the first and the second dose.”

He added: “In the case of the data coming from clinical trials, we have seen that there was a small participation of people over 65 years of age.",,,1612974917,{},gmtys42,True,t3_lgxhl1,False,True,t3_lgxhl1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lgxhl1/who_recommends_wide_use_of_astrazeneca_vaccine/gmtys42/,1612987922,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In Aspen, a group of 20 Brazilians planned to hang out in a rented vacation home in the picturesque ski town for a few weeks this winter while they got two rounds of coronavirus vaccine. 

In Delta County, tucked in the western Colorado mesas, gobs of people from Michigan and Texas have signed up for vaccine appointments — most likely because they were confused and thought they were registering in Delta County, Michigan, or Delta County, Texas.

And in Steamboat Springs, locals are pointing fingers at second-home owners who buzzed into town to collect a shot, concerned that those part-time Routt County residents might have jumped ahead in line.

This all is perfectly fine, according to state officials. 

According to the state’s rules, it doesn’t matter what county, state or even country a person lives in when they sign up for a vaccine appointment, as long as they meet the criteria for Colorado’s current phase in the immunization priority list.

Colorado is not requiring identification, proof of address or proof of citizenship to get a vaccine — the state does not want to add any barriers to those whose turn is up, Gov. Jared Polis said Tuesday. Besides, Coloradans who live on the edges of the state are driving across the borders to Wyoming, Texas and elsewhere to get vaccinated. Polis figures it all evens out.

“There’s folks in northern Colorado that have probably gone to Cheyenne,” he said during a news conference. “There’s folks in Cheyenne that have probably come back to northern Colorado. In the southwest, in New Mexico, both ways.”

Vaccines going to out-of-state residents are a small fraction of the more than 559,938 doses dispensed in Colorado as of Tuesday. Of those vaccinated so far, 5,475 people listed an out-of-state address, or fewer than 1%. ",,,1612974400,{},gmtxkk1,True,t3_lgx9q8,False,False,t3_lgx9q8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lgx9q8/state_borderjumpers_can_get_vaccinated_in/gmtxkk1/,1612987248,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I mean, I take it two things are likely to happen, but I'm unsure of the exact semantics of it.

Like, one is to alter the existing vaccines and start rolling out again. But are some countries less likely to do it than others? I think SA is considering it, but given how easily cases of that variant made it to the UK, even in lockdown, surely it'll inevitably explode there too, when locdown measures are lifted?

Someone else said that these variants aren't dominant yet, and by the time they are, it'll be autumn-time and we'll have boosters ready for them. But isn't my above point still applicable here? If, say, a country vaccinated 80% of its' populace and then reopened for summer, but a dozen cases of the Brazil variant were hanging around, then the mess'd be back within a few weeks, right?

I've seen some people say it wouldn't be *as* big of a setback as I'm thinking, because now that we have vaccines at all, even if they're not ideally suited to the new variants, we still have abilities to resist them that we didn't before. But if stuff like the AZ vaccine potentially not even reducing severe cases with the SA is true, then isn't it possible that that's just not the case?",,,1612961300,{},gmt71ou,False,t3_lgoyae,False,False,t3_lgoyae,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lgoyae/daily_discussion_thread_february_10_2021/gmt71ou/,1612961312,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

My wife's father is an anesthesiologist (doctor) in California. He had both shots.  I saw my primary care physician in Texas, he had gotten both shots.  We have a friend who is an Emergency Room doctor here in Austin, he has had both shots, but his wife and son haven't had any yet.  My 88 year old father in assisted living in Oregon has had the FIRST of two shots, with 1 more week until the second one.  They came to the assisted care location and gave it to everybody there.

That's four people across three states I know very well.  That is who is getting the vaccine so far.

The doctors are easy, they are physically there in the hospital every day for goodness sake.  The assisted care living residents are literally locked up in jail in one building, they can't escape even if they wanted to.  But I expect the next set of people down the list are going to get a little more haphazard.  My company would offer flu shots every year at my work, but since we aren't allowed anywhere near that office that won't be how it gets distributed.  

I assume at some point fairly soon they won't be able to organize it so well, and they'll start giving them at the local CVS (drugstore, they offer flu shots every year) to anybody who wants to show up.  Maybe in the local hospitals if you wander by?

Like other people have said, it will be way more interesting who is LAST getting it, and what that looks like.  Will it be 40% of people turning it down?  Will it be 10%?

It's almost the complete opposite. The pharmaceutical industry is one of the most regulated industries in the world. The companies have been receiving direct and indirect government aid, assistance, and promised orders and direct cash to make the supply of vaccines possible. This help is still ongoing. The majority of the vaccines aren't even profit-making.

So it isn't unrestricted competition in search of profit (free market). The vaccines aren't available on the free market for a consumer or business to purchase (capitalism). 

Socialism definition:
""a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole"". 

That's the most accurate description of what this is. The government and scientific bodies are partaking in every single aspect of vaccines from development to distribution.

The NIH is also working with Gritstone Oncology, a biotechnology company with an experimental technology that could incorporate protection against multiple coronavirus strains into a vaccine.

&gt;Until booster or new vaccines are ready, tracking the variants’ movements through precise genetic sequencing of patient samples and diagnostic testing will be vital to staving off a surge in infections from the new strains.

&gt;FDA diagnostics director Tim Stenzel has urged diagnostic manufacturers to consider how variants may affect the performance of their Covid-19 tests and said the agency would be happy to talk to developers who want to make updates. The regulator previously said FDA would work with CDC to evaluate how well rapid antigen tests that are already on the market detect emerging variants, but it is not clear how quickly the effort is progressing.
 
&gt;“If somebody is trying to improve the safety due to the variants, we're going to make that a priority review,” Stenzel said on an industry call last week. “So I think that's something that we haven't set as a formal priority, but very clearly that's important.”

&gt;The United States is sequencing less than a half a percent of all positive samples from Covid-19 testing, far less than many other countries. Sequencing over 5 to 10 percent would provide an early warning that new variants are becoming more prevalent and allow researchers to evaluate if they are breaking through vaccines, said Phil Febbo, chief medical officer of genomic sequencing company Illumina.

&gt;“I applaud the FDA for being proactive about how we quickly assess the safety and efficacy of these booster shots,” Febbo said. “I know they’re working on the best way to stay ahead of the virus while also assuring the safety and efficacy.”

There's actually much more specific data [on the exact same thing](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.06.21251283v1) from yesterday.  They found that cycle threshold values on positive tests dropped by about 75% and that this change came mostly on days 11-13 after vaccination.  That's by testing day (I assume), so it is consistent with immunity from infection beginning about a week after first vaccination.

The original data point is [Pfizer's trial itself](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download), where in figure 2 you can see a sharp drop in symptom onset around day 11 (corresponding to infection day ~6).  We don't know the exact correlation between symptoms and contagiousness, but we know [there is one](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19057-5).  This must be an extremely small sample size though, and probably shouldn't be used to pin an exact day.

There is one possible confounding factor though: there's some evidence older people take longer to respond to vaccination, and might actually need the second dose.  This would explain the link you gave, but is overall really bad news since most places are only vaccinating old people.  In this scenario there's actually a chance that we're only getting pennies on the dollar for every vaccination.

I think these other folks pretty much covered the key points here. Soak up some of the good news that’s been mentioned here and then take a break. The AZ vaccine is very different from the MRNA vaccines. Even if the worst news turns out to be true of AZ (and even that is far from certain) it doesn’t mean we’re back to November. 

The thing is, once you’re in that mindset, a single piece of negative evidence will cancel out ten pieces of positive evidence. And there’s plenty of positive evidence. But websites will make sure to publish every doubtful, negative detail with doom-filled headlines, and will only publish the positive when it’s solid, big news. It translates to articles to promote doubt daily, and a positive story once a week or so. But from what I’ve seen, the positive articles are built on a more solid foundation than most of negative headlines. As far as Reddit goes, a lot of people are conditioned by that pattern, and by the events last year, to favor the negative. No one like to be disappointed - pessimism can be a defense mechanism.

What fact did you use to assume Chinese Singaporeans and Indian Singaporeans don’t interact or co-mingle? Or that multilingual societies promote less “melting-y”? I have seen many, many instances first-hand that they do. I’ve pointed out multiple times to you that people of diverse ethnicities in Singapore participate in one another’s cultures, so much so that the local dialect, language, food, and customs reflect a mix of many cultures. 

Again, my point is that basing your entire perception of something solely on reading or hearing about it second hand from a few sources to the point where you feel emboldened to “educate” people who actually live there first hand is ridiculous.

Though the boundary conditions of their model is extremely limited. For instance, there have been protests at other times over the past year. While their model works excellently for data within a \~20 day bound, if you use the same model for any other month, it will fail dramatically. 

The same model offers nothing and makes counter predictions for protests in early August, late September of 2020. Also it would have a negative correlation if done with protests since the turn of the year. 

All of this leaving aside leaps of moralization. While I praise their vehement efforts, their claims of causality are static and not dynamic. Thus they fail to demonstrate the 'sufficiency' pillar of causality. 

Also, their mechanistic claims of transmission are unfounded, outdoor spread of covid-19 is negligible and marginal. No wonder they find that protests account for less than 5% of increase in (only) cumulative case counts, if at all.

* Feb-June: 100 million J&amp;J doses - 100 million Americans ([Source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/535853-johnson-johnson-on-track-for-100-million-vaccine-doses-by-end-of-june))
   * End of March (220M doses; 110M people vaccinated) w/o J&amp;J/Novavax
   * End of April (\~290M doses; \~145M people vaccinated) w/o J&amp;J/Novavax
   * End of May (\~370M doses; \~185M people vaccinated) w/o J&amp;J/Novavax
   * End of June (610M doses; 355M people vaccinated) with J&amp;J doses and w/o Novavax
   * USA has about 265 million Americans 16 years or older ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States) as of 2018)
   * Expect 10-20% not to take the vaccine (26.5-53M)

Depending on rollout and when new vaccines get approved US could have a vaccine available for everyone 16 years or older by the end of May.  That would mean they would need to vaccinate 3-5M per day and J&amp;J/Novavax get approved.  Oxford approval would also help but I have no idea about their US rollout schedule so I never added them.  If J&amp;J can ramp up production it would end sooner as it is a one shot vaccine.  

Unfortunately, there are some concerns.  Boosters may be needed to deal with variants so everyone might need 3 shots at some point (2 for J&amp;J).  J&amp;J only has a couple million vaccines ready by the end of February so their ramp up could be slower than we want.  Novavax probably won't get approved until mid May as the FDA will need to see the results of the US/Mexico phase 3 clinical trial which should end around the end of April.  Israel vaccination program is slowly down even though they have opened it up to everyone so something similar could happen in the US and the percent of people who choose to take a vaccine could be worrisome.  I would expect no big concerts, festivals, sports games, etc this summer (beaches, bbqs with friends, etc would all be okay).  Come fall, if everything goes according to plan and the variants are not a big concern I would expect packed NFL stadiums, concerts, etc.",,,1612945762,{},gmsput5,False,t3_lfxzvv,False,True,t1_gmpzyyp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxzvv/us_covid19_cases_and_hospitalizations_log_biggest/gmsput5/,1612952424,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Because of those lies, or half truths or whatever you want to call the omissions, officials fomented an idea in the public that wearing masks, like the ones many in the public have sitting around in garages and toolboxes, were unnecessary and perhaps even wrong to wear. The public was not encouraged to become early mask adopters to stay safe from a coming airborne pandemic, or at the time possibly airborne. Instead they were encouraged to walk around exposed by the very people whose job it is to warn and protect them. 

The WHO and other health officials knew or should have known exactly what effect their statements would have on the public and they probably decided that overall having healthy medical staff would save more people than it would kill.

I can get a job anywhere in the world, in multiple industries. I care about my patients so I stay at the bedside with them when they are at their sickest. 

**Unlike** hospital administrators who have zero skills and bring absolutely no value to the patients or healthcare. They only care about lining their own pockets. And you can see this this very year as they took major bonuses *during a crisis* while furloughing the workers. 

Executives and administrators aren’t even “medical people.” You don’t know what you’re looking at or talking about when it comes to patient care, and you shouldn’t be making decisions about it. Your decisions have caused further suffering, pain, and death as well. You have MBAs at best— and there are too many of you at the bloated top, corporatizing the hospital and patient care- it’s disgusting. 

You may be worried about how *you’ll get paid* if the hospital goes insolvent, but not me. Unlike your MBA, I actually have useful skills that I can apply anywhere (while helping people, not screwing them over). 

The general public will eventually catch on about hospital admin and their greedy corporate tactics to patient care. The younger generation isn’t ok with it. Until then, I can only hope that if any hospital exec gets admitted, that he receives the same exact care that he personally set up and made decisions for— no nurse for hours bc they have too many other patients, no doctor for same, no supplies, and no help.

My point was, that panic buying is what happened, that caused a shortage. Without the panic buying, there is no shortage and, in fact, there was no shortage of supply, but rather an artificially inflated demand for tp. This is different than having extra supplies; I grew up in poverty and having tp was not always a given, so I too tend to buy an extra pack on reflex when I don't necessarily need it. But telling your friends to stock up is exactly what caused the panic buying in the first place. There was no need to stock up and the only reason you feel like you had enough to last the shortage was because some people had enough to cause a shortage and others were left scrambling because idiots bought two years supplies. 

Again, sorry you took this so personally, but it's important to note the distinction. We often learn from history and we should act differently next time there's a panic to buy tp.

Hi. I'm feeling a little low on the mixed-bags of news we've been getting and I wondered if someone could offer some clarity on where we're likely to be heading in the year to come.

So like, with current vaccines working to mitigate vanilla COVID, but with variants ready to come to town (with seemingly varying evidence on if current vaccines do much to help with them, or - in the case of the AZ vaccine tested on the SA variant - anything at all), are we set for a lengthy game of cat and mouse?

Just a series of ""Whoops, new variant, better start over!"" seeing as mutations seem to be cropping up comically quicker than folks were saying they ought to (those mutations showing up in Kent seem almost farcical, and apparently the UK's one of the only nations thoroughly assessing this stuff, so such examples could be showing up everywhere??) Is it possible for the benefits of current vaccines to cover countries until boosters show up, or will lifting lockdown restrictions in summer just mean variants will just explode into a populace that has little resistance to them?",,,1612965574,{},gmte6ys,False,t3_lgoyae,False,True,t3_lgoyae,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lgoyae/daily_discussion_thread_february_10_2021/gmte6ys/,1612965584,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I don't think we have ever in modern times had a virus that spread basically unchecked for a year.  The ""swine flu"" spread pretty widely and it was eventually estimated that about 20% of the world's population had been exposed. Covid seems to be at least as contagious if not more so.

""Herd immunity"" is not an on/off switch but is by degree. If say 50% of the population in certain areas, like population centers, has been exposed, that all by itself would significantly cut the spread. The last flu vaccine was 39% effective and 29% effective the year before that.

It's not an issue with the vaccine, it's a whole issue with complex European rules which don't work in a 27 member union. 

Member country want to keep some sovereignty so decision at the European level need to have the parliament (representing the people) and the council (representing the member state) agreeing.  Often you need the 27 member states agreeing, or at least the special majority (Majority of the states representing the majority of the people). 

This means that the whole decision process at the European level sucks.  Even agreeing on banana curvature radius or patent law needs years.

Let's start at Figure 1.  What are the number 1 and 2 co-morbidities with COVID-19?  Influenza/Pneumonia and Respiratory Failure.

Those aren't pre-existing conditions in that a ""healthy 21 year old"" couldn't develop during their COVID treatment.  Those are things that COVID causes and/or makes you more susceptible to.  

Let's look down the list.  We got Sepsis, Renal Failure, Heart Failure, Intentional and Unintentional Injury.  Those are all pretty easy to ID that they aren't exclusively pre-existing conditions, they can all develop during COVID-19.  There might be some others in there (like say ""Adult respiratory distress syndrome."" I don't know exactly what that is as a laymen, but from a quick MayoClinic read it sure sounds like something that COVID-19 could cause) that I can't really ID.

Okay, so let's move down the article.  Figure 3: Percent of population with ""Co-morbidities.""  This is where the article goes in the garbage.  When he says ""co-morbidities"" here, he means pre-existing conditions.  Look at the data he is compiling and transforming.  It's only going to ID some of those co-morbidites.  It's looking at people with diabetes, asthma, COPD, etc.  It's not going to be able to ID people who develop pneumonia.  Or those who get into a car accident during the course of their COVID diagnosis/treatment.  It's not including people who die of Sepsis.


That got a bit convoluted, are you tracking my criticism of the article?

This might make it more clear.  If a healthy 21 year old dies of COVID-19 and pneumonia, he's tossing them in that bucket of 16% of the population with pre-existing conditions.  They aren't in that bucket.  They're in the 84% that didn't have any pre-existing conditions.

Now, you left one level off your list. So here is the history of what's been recommended since then (with N95 always being the best option if available to you): any kind of face covering, *non-vented mask that wraps under chin* (i.e. not a bandana open at the bottom), double masking.

&gt;Several months before the coronavirus pandemic began, the Trump administration eliminated a key American public health position in Beijing intended to help detect disease outbreaks in China, Reuters has learned.

&gt;No other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after Quick left in July, according to the sources. Zhu said an embedded expert can often get word of outbreaks early, after forming close relationships with Chinese counterparts.

&gt;Trump’s elimination of the office suggested, along with his proposed budget cuts for the CDC, that he did not see the threat of pandemics in the same way that many experts in the field did.

&gt;“One year later I was mystified when the White House dissolved the office, leaving the country less prepared for pandemics like COVID-19,” Beth Cameron, the first director of the unit, wrote in an op-ed Friday in The Washington Post.

If the staff are bringing it in should we ban children from coming into nursing homes?   What about other unvaccinated adults?  Don't masks work?  Can we not just wear masks?

All of the inconsistencies quite frankly are ridiculous rules are not helpful. 

There has been zero long term effects studies done.  ADE is a thing. We simply don't know right now.

But more to the point we should have outlawed anyone under 40 without preexisting conditions from getting it right now. I know people who had covid getting the shot that should have went to grandma.  It's waste of a vaccine. 

Oh and if do get the shot you still have mask and do all the other stuff anyways. Great selling point Fauci.  How about I live my life normally like I have been for months and disregard your flip flopping recommendations.

The military had more people die in training accidents in the army in 2019 than have died from covid 19 in all the branches.  The simple fact is a lot of people don't consider it an issue.

The pandemic is likely about over.  Simply vaccinating the over 65 crowd will end hospital overloading and at that point we need to move on.

More like 85% herd immunity. And also it would require 2 shots not 1. Everyone getting 1 shot wouldn't work.  So to reach herd immunity assume 330million people in the US that's 660 million doses for let's say 95% immunity assuming the vaccine given is 95% effective.  To get to 85% of the population you'd need. 561 million doses distributed (2 for 280.5 million people). If we are at 10% vaccinated now then we can even assume that's with 2 doses although it's more than likely talking about how many vaccinated in general.  That moves the needle to 33 million vaccinated and 247.5 million people  or  595 million doses to herd immunity.  So in order to get herd immunity by January 2022 we'd have about  324 days to distribute 595 million doses.  That would put us at a vaccination rate of 1.84 million doses distributed a day. Which seems like a good average for us to maybe top out at eventually.  So my reasoning of January 2022 is very valid.

Your math you assume 1 million doses a day for ""east math"". To reach your ridiculously low-ball herd immunity number of 60% your world would require. 330 doses to have 95% immunity for 165 million people to get 50% of the population vaccinated on top of the 10% already vaccinated (assuming they have been fully vaccinated 2 shots) to get your min of 60%.  330 vaccinations using your number of 1 million per day gives us 330 days minimum to reach herd immunity (not 6-7 months) to herd immunity aaaaand were back to January 2022 for herd immunity. 

Hate to burst the hopium but 2022 is realistically the best estimate for herd immunity to get here in both of out math. That is all assuming that we don't get any vaccine resistant strains that would cause the need for new vaccines and revaxinations if the varients become dominant in the population which they probably would due to vaccinations suppressing the non resistant strains.",,,1612958750,{},gmt3k77,False,t3_lgckdr,False,True,t1_gmsx2wc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lgckdr/1_in_10_americans_have_now_received_covid_vaccine/gmt3k77/,1612958760,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

But the thing is, almost all vaccines are being used on extremely old people on care homes, isolated from the rest of society, which, sorry for the blunt description but this is just the cold reality, are nearly dead.

Here in Sweden, a country slightly above the EU average, with the news Moderna will also give us the finger and deliver doses as they please, came the news that people over 70 that are healthy might be vaccinated by May. Of course, if we don't get further delays.

I don't think this is the best option for the society, as while this will bring down deaths faster, it will not reduce the spread faster and enable us lifting restrictions as soon as possible. But even if it was, those people are basically isolated and cut off from society. People really don't see vaccines in their daily life and this adds to the frustration.

I know people who were vaccinated in Russia. They just signed up, waited a few days and got the jab. I know people who were vaccinated in Brazil: they were healthcare workers, but not covid frontline people. They were psychologists or therapists. While those countries have vaccination rates worse than the EU average, i would say vaccines are more acessible there than here. Here in Europe maybe people in those categories will get a vaccine in the summer or later. I don't know anyone who was vaccinated in the EU yet.

The ministry agreed to provide the tests following a request by the head of the HCM City Department of Health at a meeting on Wednesday between Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam and the HCM City People’s Committee. 

Deputy Minister of Health Trần Văn Thuấn said the ministry would provide additional assistance to the city in the upcoming time.

The standing team for COVID-19 prevention and control in HCM City is headed by Deputy Minister of Health Nguyễn Trường Sơn.

Nguyễn Tấn Bỉnh, head of the city's Department of Health, said the health sector is giving rapid diagnostic tests to more than 1,600 staff of VIAGS Company which provides cargo service at Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport, where an outbreak has occurred.

Eight employees of the company tested positive for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

Because some people, designated F2, who had contact with COVID-19 patients, designated F1, tested positive, all of VIAG (Vietnam Airport Ground Services) company staff and others working at Tân Sơn Nhất airport were being tested, he added.

Nguyễn Trí Dũng, head of the city Centre for Diseases Control and Prevention, said the rapid tests will be used to supplement PCR tests, which are considered the most accurate tests and give results only six hours later. 

Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam, head of the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control, said that HCM City should also screen and take testing samples from people at bus stations and coffee stores in areas near factories and near the city gateways.

Đam said that the city should not miss any transmission source and should monitor and provide tests at bus and train stations. The city should also try to identify all locations of outbreaks in the community, he added.

He noted that sources of transmission could also come from people illegally entering the country.

HCM City is the first in the country to set up criteria on “giving scores” for COVID-19 prevention and control activities at health facilities, schools, factories and bus stations, he said.

The city and other provinces have given instructions to these public places about preventive measures and have also provided updates to the ""Map of Safely Living with COVID-19"" which can be found on the website *www.antoancovid.vn*.

The city has quickly traced F1 and F2 contacts, and has zoned and locked down 33 sites that contain locally transmitted cases.

On February 10, the standing team for COVID-19 prevention and control in the city checked the lockdown area in Gò Vấp District and Military Hospital 175.

The team also checked the field hospital and quarantine area at Military Hospital 175.

Nguyễn Hồng Sơn, director of the Military Hospital 175, said that after the new COVID-19 patients came to the hospital, all of the hospital staff were tested.

The quarantine area at the field hospital was set up to admit medical officials who have had close contact with COVID-19 patients.

Deputy Minister of Health Sơn instructed the Military Hospital 175 to prepare to admit COVID-19 patients if other designated hospitals become overloaded.  

Elsewhere, the Central Highlands province of Gia Lai on February 10 recorded four more people testing positive for COVID-19, increasing the total number of COVID-19 patients in the locality to 26.

The four new patients, who were F1 contacts, have been isolated in quarantine areas. VNS""",,,1612974020,{},gmtwom0,True,t3_lgx5pu,False,True,t3_lgx5pu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lgx5pu/vietnam_30000_rapid_diagnostic_tests_to_quickly/gmtwom0/,1612986758,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I said specifically. What is ""brain fog""? What is the threshold for this sort of thing? How severe does it have to be, and how long does it have to last? 

I had Covid and was asymptomatic EXCEPT I did experience fatigue and brain fog about a week after I had 'recovered' (feels weird to say recovered when I never had any symptoms while positive, but I think that's the right term). It was fairly mild, but obviously some way outside of anything I have personally ever experienced in my life.

Should I be counted in that 30% of long haulers? How do the symptoms need to manifest and how long do they need to go on before the ""long hauler"" box gets checked?

I find it outright hard to believe that 30% of all people suffer anything what we would consider ""long hauler"", which to me means some actual long term, debilitating effects. And this is doubly true when the headline links it to young people, who are usually asymptotic anyway.

&gt;The developers have received scientific advice from EMA providing them with the latest regulatory and scientific guidance for the development of their vaccine. In line with the Agency’s transparency policy, the vaccine is included in the list of COVID-19 medicines and vaccines that have received scientific advice from the Agency.

&gt;EMA is in dialogue and collaborating with the company to define the next steps. The developers have expressed their interest that the vaccine be considered for a rolling review. This ad-hoc procedure can only be used during emergencies such as the current pandemic. It allows EMA to assess data on a vaccine or a medicine as they become available, while the development is still ongoing. The formal marketing authorisation procedure can then take place in a very short timeframe. Rolling review is reserved for the most promising medicines and vaccines. EMA’s Human Medicines Committee (CHMP) and the COVID-19 EMA pandemic Task Force (COVID-ETF) need to give their agreement first before developers can submit their application for initiation of the rolling review process.

&gt;EMA will promptly inform the public of any new assessments of COVID-19 vaccines or medicines started by the Agency. EMA always publishes a news announcement when, following agreement by CHMP and COVID-ETF, an application for rolling review is received from the developers and the assessment starts. Similarly, EMA publishes a news announcement when it receives a valid application for marketing authorisation. The list of treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 under evaluation is updated in parallel to the publication. This means that if EMA has not communicated, the status of a given COVID-19 medicine/vaccine remains unchanged.

[https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-02-02-oxford-coronavirus-vaccine-shows-sustained-protection-76-during-3-month-interval](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-02-02-oxford-coronavirus-vaccine-shows-sustained-protection-76-during-3-month-interval)

* Analyses reveal single standard dose efficacy from day 22 to day 90 post vaccination of 76% with protection not falling in this three-month period
* After the second dose vaccine efficacy from two standard doses is 82.4% with the 3-month interval being used in the UK. **(82.4% effective, with a 95% confidence interval of 62.7% - 91.7% at 12+ weeks)**
* Data supports the 4-12 week prime-boost dosing interval recommended by many global regulators
* Analyses of PCR positive swabs in UK population suggests vaccine may have substantial effect on transmission of the virus with **67% reduction in positive swabs among those vaccinated**

You are obviously not from Israel.

Strict lockdown is only on papers, people are walking everywhere, finding different loop holes, the secular Jews blame the religious ones for having having underground studies open, in return the religious groups blame the secular ones for the never ending anti-Bibi protests. Then you got the arabs who don't give a damn at all and just do what they want while the authorities are afraid to mess with them, and as the cherry on top you got the anti-vaxxers who encourage people to set an appointment for the vaccine and not show up so the vaccine go to waste.

Businesses are operating underground, they learned from the previous lockdowns, when businesses that refused to close got heavy fines, but later those were canceled, so as a result, those who were law abiding lost a lot of business to those who kept operating, without consequences.

I also know several people who kept complaining about everyone not following the rules, but when they had a close contact with a confirmed person, they refused to get tested so they can keep working and not be put on quarantine. Moreover, I know people who were sick so they left their phone at home so they wouldn't be traced, and went out while being sick.

So that's why we have high numbers.",,,1612972433,{},gmtszch,False,t3_lg5sez,False,True,t1_gmq4qc1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lg5sez/more_than_97_of_recent_covid_deaths_in_israel/gmtszch/,1612984719,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Also, the argument for prolonging this whole ordeal is flawed in itself. The choice to prolong how we deal with covid is a political one. Whether you open up everything day and throw caution to the wind, or choose to lockdown for years on end, those are both political decisions. Choosing to extend restrictions is a choice to extend restrictions and prolong this whether covid is present or not. 

Every single person who brings up long term impacts seems to ignore that what happens with covid mirrors other viral infections and long term effects still seem to be rare. Basing policy on hypotheticals is stupid. And they forget that every day you continue restrictions that are very real costs and long term impacts that are compounded on.

This weekend, supported a local brewery. 

&gt;Q2: Tell me about how COVID-19 mandates have changed your ways of shopping?

A mixed bag. I mostly shop online (I try to avoid Amazon) but that was true before COVID too. This is due a combination of factors, partly because of governmental mandates for COVID but also partly because there are too many people without respect of others. 

&gt;Q3: If a small business has curbside pickup or dining outside, does this increase the chance of using the services that the small business has to offer? If so why?

Yes. Outdoor dining has been shown to dramatically mitigate the risk. Curbside pickup is just great period. 

&gt;Q4: What measures can small businesses take to improve the safety of customers from Covid-19?

Any retailer focusing just on COVID is missing the bigger picture. I think this outbreak was actually a much needed kick in the pants for many small businesses to update their damn systems. I can't count the number of places which were using antiquated card machines that only finally upgraded to a modern (more secure) system due to COVID. Online ordering and curbside pickup should remain as an option from here on out. 

&gt;Q5: Do you do most of your shopping online or ordering through the phone? If so would you stay doing that when small businesses open back up or go back to going to the businesses in person such as restaurants or shopping centers?

As things will open back up, I will go back to some more in-person shopping.

And we are not talking necessary about long term side effects of vaccinations in generell, but for example production errors with an negative impact on peoples health. This is why especially Pfizer did take so long. 

On the other hand , in summer because of protest of Belgium , Merkels decision to make it an EU project ( for symbolic reasons) and von der Leyen wanted that project ,  the few health ministers of Germany, the Netherlands , France and Italy had to to give up there fast vaccinations ordering plans , and give the responsibility to the EU.
So the commision did set up a team from the 4 staates mentioned above (G, F,I, NL) and with Spain, Portugal and Poland , and started with a budget from a bit over 2 billion €. You can clearly see that these countries are bad when it comes to being representive for all EU member staates. 
Fast forward 3 months into september, our German Health Minister was making pressure since only 3 from 7 or 8 companies had an contract so far. Problem was, now the commission requested additional 750 MILLION € to have up to over 4 billionen €. Now comes the central problem , that the EU is on purpose designed in a way which is very slow . If there is some contract or anything the commission is negogiating, it gets on purpose only 50-70 % of the money, so that at this point every country can still interfier and make sure there interest are considered. Many eastern european countries (especially Bulgaria) wanted to have less Moderna and Pfizer because of the prize and more cheaper vaccines , like AZ  , but also the logistics of cooling down -80 °C for Pfizer was a huge problem for the purer eastern EU states. Also a lot of sceptism about the new MRNA technology was also present. And now you have some of the 27 staates who fighting over of how many to buy from 7-8 different vaccines . And since everybody should get the same of every vaccines ( an idea that was scrapped afterwards anyways 
) you have to find a common ground for all the member staates. 

Well our German Health Minister did give an garantee to buy 100 million doses from Pfizer early on , no matter what the other countries are doing. He wanted then to scale that up realtive to EU population , to 570 millionen doses , which was denied and the commission ordered early on only about 200 million doses with an option for 100 million more. Later on the EU ordered 600 million doses anyways.",,,1612965015,{},gmtd5wq,False,t3_lgsfc9,False,True,t1_gmt5hr7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lgsfc9/coronavirus_eu_chief_says_bloc_was_too_late_on/gmtd5wq/,1612965026,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There is also a belief that the first wave of the Spanish Flu in 1918 was not that bad, but the second wave caused by a possible variant was many times worse.

So I think people just have this in their heads as a possible outcome and have become so fatalistic and pessimistic that they just state it as a fact before it has even been proven.

Meanwhile the evidence is mounting that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are effective against the variants, either fully effective or at least effective enough to prevent serious illness.

Again more complexity. The virus isn't some orderly ball floating around inside your nose. It's bouncing around maybe violently and randomly. Sometimes it hits your cell receptor sometimes it doesn't. If it's more sticky, the times it hits your recpetor it's more likely to latch on.

More complexity. Your cell can probably fight off 1 virus. But the more that make it into your cell and into many cells your body cannot fight off and you get infected. If the varient is more sticky, it takes less of a viral exposure for more to make it into your cell. And then your body can't fight these multiple attacks at once.

All of these (and theres more) make the virus more contagious without changing size.

How does your mask impact this?

More complexity. Your mask doesn't stop all virus particles. It stops enough for a certain threshold of infectivity. If you make the virus more 'sticky' that threshold of infectivity lowers. In other words it takes less virus to make it past your mask to give you an infection.

So how does this impact two masks vs 1?

The *high end* of normal weight for a 6' male is about 180 pounds versus 220 pounds for obese. That's 40 pounds of pure fat. And to be clear, the high end of BMI for an out of shape person (typical obese American) is still pretty high body fat. 

My BMI is 23 and I'm still carrying around a bit of a beer belly that I want to get rid of. For someone who has low muscle mass (doesn't exercise much), a BMI of 21 would get rid of most extra unhealthy organ/tummy fat. That's 160 pounds for a 6' person (so 60 pounds of ""excess fat"" if you're at the bottom threshold of obese). 

Fortunately the most severe health impacts don't come into play until you're obese by BMI, but people are deluding themselves if they think obese means ""10-20 pounds of extra fat."" Americans (and people across the globe) are incredibly fat - we've just normalized being overweight as ""average"" and so people don't think that being in the early stages of obese is that bad anymore.

My dad is a great example of this. He goes on about how ""only people with comorbidities die from COVID"" and that as a ""healthy 64 year old he has nothing to worry about.""

It's not great news and they could make infection rates rise in areas, but so far none of these variants have shown significant growth despite the UK doing half of the worlds genetic testing looking for them, and they appear to be just different flavours of the same hazards we already face. Providing targetted test and trace keeps them from spreading then deaths should still greatly diminish and they will only be a background risk until the booster shots in the Autumn.

Keep in mind that after a week of door to door testing in the areas those variants have been found only 76 total cases have been detected.

This makes sense.  The reason the second shot is worse than the first one is likely related to your body recognizing the virus and reacting immediately and strongly.  For those who are infected before, the body recognizes it on the first shot.

Not sure why that would mean the second shot wouldn't have the same effect, but I have seen some speculation on twitter that the 2nd shot may not be necessary for those who have been infected already (there is some evidence that the antibody response to the 2nd shot is not as robust for those who already had COVID).

Vials After Dilution 

• After dilution, store vials between 2°C to 25°C (35°F to 77°F) and use within **6 hours from the time of dilution.**

 • During storage, minimize exposure to room light, and avoid exposure to direct sunlight and ultraviolet light. 

• Any vaccine remaining in vials must be discarded after **6 hours.**

 • Do not refreeze.

Once those people get their shots there will be the people that are in the target population but are reluctant for whatever reason.

I remember talking with a student at university, that I was unsure about my planned work-related trip to France later that month.

1. At this time, people are warned against getting the vaccine within 90 days of being COVID positive. I am unsure if this is due to the degree of the immune response or something else (I have not read into it further).
2. If positive, you know your current immunity status once you recover from the illness. 
3. If positive, you can be more proactive should your prognosis shows signs of taking a turn for the worse.
4. If positive, you know the level of quarantine you have to take. 
4. Most work places have PTO/Unpaid Leave scenarios but only with a positive test result. 
4. If negative, you know that something else is likely at play and can adjust your monitoring of symptoms accordingly. 
5. If negative, you can go back to work/resume your typical life more easily.
5. Negative or positive, better data for the epidemiologists to monitor the spread of the virus.",,,1612984108,{},gmukr2u,False,t3_lgoyae,False,False,t1_gmuf0xl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lgoyae/daily_discussion_thread_february_10_2021/gmukr2u/,1613000111,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

**Study Title:** Probiotics To Eliminate COVID-19 Transmission in Exposed Household Contacts (PROTECT-EHC)

**Study Description:** The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and the effect of COVID-19 on the microbiome (the microorganisms that live in and on the human body) in exposed household contacts of COVID-19. Exposed household contacts (EHC) are people who live with someone with COVID-19  and therefore have an increased chance of contracting the virus. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, meaning subjects will be randomly assigned to receive LGG or a placebo (an inactive substance given in the same form as the active substance) and will not know which product they are receiving. Participation in this study entails taking LGG/placebo for 28 days, responding to questionnaires, and providing stool and nasal swab samples. 

**To participate, individuals must be asymptomatic, at least 1 year old, live with a household contact who has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the previous 3 days, and be willing to stop taking any current probiotics/not take any other probiotics while on the study.**

To be exact, the Netherlands has ordered 44,7 million mRNA vaccines, the Dutch population is 17,5 million. Most arriving in Q2 and Q3, but significant amounts in Q1 and Q4 too. All delivered before the end of 2021. The total Dutch order consists of 84,5 million vaccine doses. That means 53% of the vaccine doses are based on mRNA technology. 19,8 million from Pfizer, 14,2 million from Moderna and 10,7 million from CureVac. On top of that, the Pfizer (BioNTech) and CureVac vaccines were mostly funded and developed in the EU. Also, most of the vaccine production capacity from these companies are based in the EU ([https://www.vaccineseurope.eu/about-us/the-eu-vaccine-industry-in-figures/](https://www.vaccineseurope.eu/about-us/the-eu-vaccine-industry-in-figures/)). That's why the EU basically has the full responsibility of supplying the 450 million citizens of the EU and the rest of the world with mRNA vaccines.
