[],,Sanpaku,,,,,,,"Some influential politicians pushed the US intelligence community towards a finding that would justify their sides' rhetoric. They're pretty indifferent to the geopolitical fallout.

By February 2020, there were already detailed examinations of the viral genome pointing out that there were no tell-tale signs of genetic manipulation, and that the genome appeared consistent with wild-type bat coronaviruses. The key piece that was missing was a wild bat coronavirus with a receptor binding domain similar to SARS CoV-2's, but [last month](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02596-2) three wild bat coronaviruses were found in Laos with very similar RBDs.

I think its still in the range of possibility that the Wuhan Instutute of Virology, in its surveys of bat coronaviruses to prevent a repeat of 2003 SARS, collected and inadvertently distributed SARS CoV-2. But it wouldn't be a viral isolate they were researching or manipulating, as one of the first steps of such research is sequencing its genome, and posting it to the international databases for scientific priority.

So, we have a wild bat virus, with no evidence of genetic manipulation. Either introduced to human populations by the wet market trade in wild animals (exotic meat meals were common ""bribes"" in China), or inadvertent escape from some bat specimens. The only way to have more confidence in either is to do a PCR test of every bat sample at the Wuhan institute. China has no reason to permit this (they could only be harmed, diplomatically), it wouldn't prove with certainty that it came from the institute, and it wouldn't improve the current situation at all.

The researchers cautioned that the findings may not translate to non-hospitalized people with different levels of access to medical care, and that some patients in the vaccinated group may unknowingly have also had previous infections.

&gt; Still, some patterns have emerged. Two doses of an mRNA vaccine produce more antibodies, and more reliably so, than a coronavirus infection does. But the antibodies from prior infection are more diverse, potentially helping people fend off variants.

Another study of data from [Israel](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1) comes to a different conclusion to CDC:

&gt; This study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity. Individuals who were both previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and given a single dose of the vaccine gained additional protection against the Delta variant.

Still, I agree with the CDC conclusion:

&gt; Whatever the effect, doctors have warned that acquiring natural immunity is perilous and uncertain. Not everyone survives Covid in the first place, and those that do may not be able to count on a vigorous immune response.

Ufortunately in danish only, but it sets all infections and hospitalization against vaccine status. Most danes where vaccinated with Pfizer from june though august and 75% of the total population is vaccinated.

The 7 day hospitalization statistic is the most compelling: It shows that if you're under 65 and fully vaccinated, you're almost certain *not* to end up in hospital if you get a breakthrough infection.

The result applies across preexisting conditions that might otherwise cause problems (asthma, lung disease etc). So most of us catching Covid when vaccinated will probably only experience light symptoms. 

It also shows that the very young rarely end up in the hospital with Covid regardless of vaccine status. An important result. The RS virus has been a much larger issue here with children.

Everything in the summary infographic is completely solid and grounded in the data. However, by the time CNN makes a headline, it becomes:

This is not nearly as airtight, and you could even argue that it is misleading.

A 0.002% chance IS a big deal for governments, but it shouldn't be a big deal for you, an individual.

A medical policy setter will have to come to terms with the fact that their decision WILL affect a bunch of people. Assuming a country of 100 million people and  two clotting events per 100,000 doses, you're going to get something like 4,000 clotting events. That's a risk that policy setters need to balance against whatever disease they're combating.

As an individual, 0.002% is absolutely nothing. To put it in perspective, you could take the shot every single day, for nintey years (32850 doses), and you'd still have a better than 50:50 chance of never experiencing clotting.

Or put another way, you could take the vaccine every day for a year, and your chance of being ok would be about 99.3%.

I think it doesn't actually work that way. Like let's say your religion specifies no pork, you believe it would be better not to eat pork, but you nonetheless give in and eat pork sometimes due to self control issues. You still could not be compelled to eat pork eg at a company lunch as long as it's clear their religious beliefs are sincere and that that religion says no pork. It doesn't matter if you there's a video of you eating pork on facebook dated the day before the company lunch; if you're now ready to abstain from pork then you're protected civil rights laws.

One obvious difference here is that vaccination impacts other people's health/safety and there is a global emergency. Generally, your religious beliefs do not have to be accommodated at work if they're putting other people's safety at risk. I thought this might be the justice's reasoning. Turns out:

&gt;The court as a whole gave no explanation. In a concurring opinion, Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh indicated they didn’t see the case as a good candidate to be considered on the merits because of the novelty of the issues.

I don’t expect the polls to be super accurate but I do think that if 75% of parents are saying right now that they aren’t planning to immediately vaccinate their kids then it’s overly optimistic to somehow expect half of 5-11 kids to be vaccinated by the end of this year, i.e. in less than 2 months.

&gt;The three-judge panel in the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit also sent the two court cases back to the lower courts to continue.

&gt;The ongoing court cases stem from former Gov. Andrew Cuomo's order that all hospital and long-term care facility workers were required to get at least one dose of the vaccine by September 27.

&gt;CNN has reached out to the New York State Department of Health for comment, and details of how many exemptions the state has already provided.


&gt;An attorney for plaintiffs in one of the cases vowed to take the case to the US Supreme Court Friday.

&gt;""New York's mandate forces an abominable choice on New York healthcare workers: abandon their faith or lose their careers,"" said attorney Cameron Atkinson, who represents three nurses. ""They have committed their futures to God's hands, and we remain optimistic that the United States Supreme Court will strike down New York's discriminatory mandate as violating the First Amendment.""

&gt;In the second case, 17 health care workers, many of them unnamed doctors, residents and nurses, filed a lawsuit last month objecting to the New York State Department of Health's vaccine mandate, which didn't allow for religious exemptions. A judge issued a temporary restraining order on September 14 related to the religious exemptions.

&gt;CNN reached out to an attorney representing these health care workers for reaction.

&gt;Gov. Kathy Hochul praised the court's decision.
""On Day One, I pledged as Governor to battle this pandemic and take bold action to protect the health of all New Yorkers,"" Hochul said in a statement. ""I commend the Second Circuit's findings affirming our first-in-the-nation vaccine mandate, and I will continue to do everything in my power to keep New Yorkers safe.""

&gt;Nearly 16,000 health care employees in New York State have been granted religious exemptions by their employers prior to Friday's court ruling, the state's health department confirmed to CNN Friday night.

&gt;That's 15,844 employees of hospitals, nursing homes, adult homes, Certified Home Health Agencies (CHHA), Licensed Home Care Service Agencies (LHCSA) and hospice facilities, said Jeffrey Hammond, deputy director of communications for the New York State Department of Health.

&gt;Hammond provided a breakdown of the data, including the number of employees and percentages of staff impacted in each health care group.

&gt;• Hospitals (as of October 26)​: 6,433 employees (1.3%)
&gt;• Certified Home Health Agencies (as of October 26): 505 employees (4%), of which, 365 are direct care staff
&gt;• Licensed Home Care Service Agencies (as of October 26): 5,573 employees(2.1%), of which, 5,070 are direct care staff

As others have pointed out in this thread, the booster actually results in *more* than a recovery of antibodies- the antibody counts are higher than post-2 weeks second shot. The memory B cells should also have a broader profile of antibodies they can create to eradicate the virus (because more experience) and thus generally a better ability to handle variants. 

The body has evolved over time to handle threats, and the immune system itself has done the same. The body doesn't want to invest, say- a bunch of energy to produce memory B cells with very broad profiles and also maintain massive antibodies for a pathogen that it only sees once (first shot). The invader appears, the immune system learns how to bind to and destroy it, then takes a note of how, then lets the antibodies fade and goes back to BAU.

Once the invaders come back again (second shot)- but still relatively shortly afterwards (3-4 weeks)- the immune system produces antibodies knowing what it knows. Now that the invader has been seen again, the immune system is going to take it more seriously- its going to drop more antibodies and dedicate more of its resources to understanding this pathogen should it see it again. Many antibodies made, more broad a profile of antibodies stored in B cells, etc.

Now the invader shows up *again*, but this time 6 months later. Again the immune system gets practice, gets to build even more breadth into its antibodies, etc. Beyond that, the immune system has been conditioned to be effective, efficient (not having to panic and bomb entire areas of cells [cytokine storm]), and able to very quickly to adapt to variants (since it already has many tricks built up in memory, it can see what works and what doesn't, etc).

When you get *actual* SARS-COV2- lets say hypothetically with a mutated spike protein that makes antibodies very ineffective- your immune system still knows damn well how to move forward. It already knows what doesn't work, and has experience broadening its attack strategy. It knows the threat is recurrent (or at least similar to one that was), and is prepared to invest resources because clearly this threat is not going away.

The immune system needs practice, but unlike your brain where you can say ""man I need to practice X because I need to be good at Y"" the immune system needs pathogens to munch on, etc.

Who are you to define someone's religion?

""In all his activity a man is bound to follow his conscience in order that he may come to God, the end and purpose of life. It follows that he is not to be forced to act in a manner contrary to his conscience. Nor, on the other hand, is he to be restrained from acting in accordance with his conscience, especially in matters religious"" - St. Paul VI

""religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection"" - Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana

Also in the ""before time"" no one ever had to prove their status at most jobs (exceptions of course) and a-lot of states allowed exceptions for schools etc. based on ""personal belief""

So yeah people are fighting back against getting a vaccine that doesn't slow the spread

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-28/getting-vaccinated-doesn-t-stop-people-from-spreading-delta

At this point, the only potential benefit is reduced symptoms if infected. Why not just allow people to roll the dice on that? It's their life, let them make their own decisions.

Far more robust studies have refuted this for a long time. It’s not a good reason to go out and get COVID instead of getting vaccinated, since COVID is way more dangerous of way to acquire immunity, but this study is simply bad.

[This paper, titled “Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Persist for up to 13 Months and Reduce Risk of Reinfection”](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.07.21256823v3) found about 97% protection from being seropositive:

&gt; Overall, 69 SARS-CoV-2 infections developed in the COVID-19 negative group (incidence of 12.22 per 100 person-years) versus one in the COVID-19 positive group (incidence of 0.40 per 100 person-years), indicating a relative reduction in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection of 96.7%

[This one, titled “SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of antibody-positive compared with antibody-negative health-care workers in England: a large, multicentre, prospective cohort study (SIREN)”](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21\)00675-9/fulltext) found 99% protection when only “probable” or “confirmed” reinfections were included (which would be the proper way to compare to vaccination, since vaccine trials only counted confirmed cases, not suspected cases with no tests):

&gt; **Restricting reinfections to probable reinfections only, we estimated that between June and November 2020, participants in the positive cohort had 99% lower odds of probable reinfection, adjusted OR (aOR) 0.01 (95% CI 0.00-0.03). Restricting reinfections to those who were symptomatic we estimated participants in the positive cohort had 95% lower odds of reinfection**, aOR 0.08 (95% CI 0.05-0.13). Using our most sensitive definition of reinfections, including all those who were possible or probable the adjusted odds ratio was 0.17 (95% CI 0.13-0.24).

&gt; The Supreme Court has rejected an emergency appeal from health care workers in Maine to block a vaccine mandate that went into effect Friday.

&gt; Three conservative justices noted their dissents. The state is not offering a religious exemption to hospital and nursing home workers who risk losing their jobs if they are not vaccinated.

&gt; Only New York and Rhode Island also have vaccine mandates for health care workers that lack religious exemptions. Both are the subject of court fights and a court has allowed workers in New York to seek religious exemptions while the lawsuit plays out.

&gt; The high court has previously turned away students at Indiana University and teachers in New York City who objected to being vaccinated. Both the university and city allow people to seek religious exemptions.

&gt;*""The findings in this report are subject to at least seven limitations. First, although this analysis was designed to compare two groups with different sources of immunity, patients might have been misclassified. If SARS-CoV-2 testing occurred outside of network partners’ medical facilities or if vaccinated persons are less likely to seek testing, some positive SARS-CoV-2 test results might have been missed and thus some patients classified as vaccinated and previously uninfected might also have been infected. In addition, despite the high specificity of COVID-19 vaccination status from these data sources, misclassification is possible. Second, the aOR could not be further stratified by time since infection or vaccination because of sparse data and limited ability to control for residual confounding that could be magnified within shorter intervals. The aOR that did not adjust for time might also be subject to residual confounding, particularly related to waning of both types of immunity. Third, selection bias might be possible if vaccination status influences likelihood of testing and if previous infection influences the likelihood of vaccination. Previous work from the VISION network did not identify systematic bias in testing by vaccination status, based on data through May 2021 (1). Fourth, residual confounding might exist because the study did not measure or adjust for behavioral differences between the comparison groups that could modify the risk of the outcome. Fifth, these results might not be generalizable to nonhospitalized patients who have different access to medical care or different health care–seeking behaviors, particularly outside of the nine states covered. Sixth, the statistical model incorporated the use of a weighted propensity score method which is subject to biases in estimates or standard errors if the propensity score model is misspecified. Numerous techniques were used to reduce potential suboptimal specification of the model, including but not limited to including a large set of covariates for machine learning estimation of propensity scores, including covariates in both regression and propensity models, ensuring large sample sizes and checking stability of weights, and conducting secondary analyses to assess robustness of results. Finally, the study assessed COVID-19 mRNA vaccines only; findings should not be generalized to the Janssen vaccine.""*",,,,1635549502,{},hiksljy,False,t3_qijvsb,False,False,t1_hijwkip,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qijvsb/vaccination_protects_against_covid19_more/hiksljy/,1635741540.0,13,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_11g516,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;Maine has required health care workers to be vaccinated against various contagious diseases since 1989, and eliminated exemptions on religious or philosophical grounds under a state law enacted in 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic began. The state does exempt workers for whom the given vaccine would be “medically inadvisable” in the judgment of a health care professional.  
&gt;  
&gt;The 2019 law was the subject of a referendum, with about 73 percent of the state’s voters approving it.

On the other hand, the booster still does provide some benefit, since protection against infection has waned quite a bit and the booster really seems to help that as well as touch up protection against hospitalization.

If you are someone who shares the mindset of the FDA and CDC where the only thing you care about is hospitalization and death, then it's a hard choice where the benefits are risks are both small. On the other hand, if you are someone who is worried about long COVID, or getting so sick you almost need to go to the hospital, or you are more vulnerable in some way so you are more likely to be a breakthrough case, or if you want all of the protection you can get to try to avoid spreading it to someone vulnerable that you live with, then it's an easy choice because the benefits are significant.

The FDA and CDC have tried to capture the difference between these two groups in their eligibility list, but IMO they have done a poor job and it really should just be eligible to everyone and recommended to those over a certain age or with severe health conditions (instead of health conditions that 80% of people have).",,,,1635606350,{},hiney28,False,t3_qit0cw,False,True,t1_himzv9e,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qit0cw/third_covid_shot_reduces_hospitalization_by_93/hiney28/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_llftk,False,False,,,False,4c35daaec2d042e3b9828e9dfae4a35097558b39,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1635606364.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public

But there's in perception of risk between something that is definitely going to happen (getting the vaccine) vs something that might happen (getting covid.) If you are a person who believes there are risks with the vaccine, it can be harder to choose to definitely take that risk, vs this vague amorphous risk of something that may or may not happen. You don't know for sure if you'll get covid if you don't get vaccinated, (or if you'll be significantly I'll if you do) but you do know for sure that you are getting the vaccine if you get the vaccine.

Is it actually riskier to get the vaccine? Of course not. But people freeze up on the choice.

Add in misinformation, and it gets muddy for a lot of people.

Irritant Smoke QLFT Protocol
The fourth method that OSHA permits for QLFT is the Irritant Smoke Protocol. This test utilizes a chemical called stannic chloride (SnCl4), which is sprayed out of a ventilation tube around the test subject's head with the use of a squeeze bulb. As ambient air is forced through the tube, SnCl4 reacts with moisture in the air producing a white hydrochloric acid fume (HCl) and tin compounds. If enough of the irritant smoke leaks into the mask it will result in a reaction such as coughing or watery eyes (OSHA requires that the person being fit tested close his or her eyes when using this protocol).

In addition, irritant smoke fit testing has been studied by NIOSH in a NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluation Report (HETA 93-040-2315). In this report, NIOSH asserts that unhealthy concentrations of hydrogen chloride resulting from the reaction of stannic chloride with ambient humidity can occur during the fit test. On August 4, 1999 NIOSH released an updated Respirator Use Policy that states:
""NIOSH reviewed the revised protocol for the irritant smoke test in
OSHA's final respiratory protection standard and concluded that a
risk still exists for overexposure to hydrogen chloride during a
facepiece fit test. To check their sensitivity, test subjects are
required to breathe irritant smoke both before and after a
successful fit test. Generated concentrations to which test subjects
are subjected are not measured in the test protocol. A
concentration of 5 ppm is the accepted threshold level at which a
response is evoked from most persons. A fit test is a failure when a
test subject experiences an involuntary cough or irritation.
Retesting requires repeating the sensitivity check. In each case, the
responses of coughing and irritation are the adverse health effects
for which hydrogen chloride's exposure limits are intended to protect against. Consequently, NIOSH maintains its recommendation against the use of irritant smoke as a fit testing agent.""",,,,1635609043,{},hinl3w4,False,t3_qit0cw,False,True,t1_himxxak,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qit0cw/third_covid_shot_reduces_hospitalization_by_93/hinl3w4/,1635804170.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_rq916,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;Why would I need a booster?

Unless you're in a vulnerable population.  You really don't.  
Pfizer wants the government to buy you a third shot though.

Getting another shot would yes temporarily increase your antibodies again, and thus pump back up your immunity *from infection*.  

But again, the effect will be temporary.  Your memory cells will however maintain their ability to fight off the virus and prevent severe illness if (or when) you get infected.

Sort of like Hebrewchucknorris says though, you may suffer some symptoms while your memory cells are kicking into gear.

If my personal anecdote is helpful, I was infected about a month ago, about 5 months in from my second Pfizer dose.  I was fine.  Stuffy sinuses, dazed and fatigued sometimes.  No fever.

No, hospitals are not overflowing in most places. There are a few locations with very low vaccination rates that are having problems, but for the most part hospitals are doing fine. The unvaccinated will also develop immunity from being infected and recovering, so the ones that recover will be less likely to get it again.

I really believe the people that are ruining the society are those that continue to think about covidf as dangerous. It is not. Get vaccinated and you are safe and you can stop worrying about it and live a completely normal life. You are probably more likely to be killed in an auto accident than from covid. If you choose not to be vaccinated, it is on you.

For me, I really don't think about covid except for getting sucked in to a reddit conversation. Once I was vaccinated, it was over. I never wear a mask and I temporarily moved to a location where almost no one wears masks. It is wonderful. You need to try to do the same.

Actually, this is incorrect too. Your beliefs do not need to be part of an organized religion. They only need be sincere and religious in nature.

From my previous link:

&gt;These protections apply whether the religious beliefs or practices in question are common  or non-traditional, and regardless of whether they are recognized by any organized religion.

So even if it's their own personal religion they invented, it's just as protected as, say, Catholicism.

The most likely reason is what I said in my first post- that accommodations that compromise a workplace's safety do not need to be accepted. Since this is a pandemic, not getting vaccinated puts other employees at risk and if it's a hospital it also puts patients at risk.

I'm saying that there are Catholics that don't agree with the Pope. I mean exactly and only that.

&gt; I just don’t know how you can claim a religious exemption when the pope himself, the appointed successor to Saint Peter, says to get vaccinated.

How many sects are there? Even in Catholicism? 

How many religions are there that identify as Christians?

 &gt; Either you undermine and challenge the legitimacy of the Papacy, or you get fucking vaccinated.

Why would that stop anyone?

There are Catholics that believe Pious XII was the last legitimate Pope, just like there are Americans that think that we haven't had a true [Leader* avoiding automod] since the 1860s.

Seems there’s some slight truth behind this, but a lot of it is hurt feelings over credit given. I’m not inclined to give anyone who appears on Bannon’s podcast benefit of the doubt. 

Yes, the vaccines aren’t quite perfect, like say measles which can drive a r-0 of 18 virus down to near zero transmission. But they’re damn good. They do create some positive pressure, and if supply was limited it absolutely should go to vulnerable populations. Unfortunately it doesn’t seem likely that it can be meaningfully redirected (and there is unfortunately anti vax propaganda sprouting up worldwide, including in Africa) which really doesn’t need that in addition to supply issues and oversupply in 1st world countries.

As it is, the unvaccinated* are far more likely to spread and catch delta, so they’re the ones so they’re generally the worst offenders for helping Covid mutate by providing opportunity (*excluding those that can’t yet get vaccinated, like kids). 

Then it’s the highly at risk population, which can’t mount a strong response even with 2-3 doses, and are good Petri dishes for evolution in a weakened ‘training’ environment. 

Then there’s the rest of us. From what I’ve seen my immunity was approximately 95% resistant to getting base Covid after extended exposure. After 7+ months I’m now probably 60-80% from extended exposure to delta, and still highly likely to get an asymptomatic or mild case and clear it quickly if I do get delta. 

A booster brings me back to 95% again. Is it strictly needed? No. Would I get one if I thought it was in any way stealing from someone in the first 2 categories anywhere in the world? No, I’d wait at least 12 months or for further guidance and studies. But from all I’ve read we’ve got doses going to waste around the country, and if it’s between my arm or expired and into the bin, I’ll choose my arm.",,,,1635622610,{},hiohhmt,False,t3_qj2vd2,False,False,t3_qj2vd2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qj2vd2/at_least_89_of_vaccinated_american_adults_will/hiohhmt/,1635824270.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_8pgbhtgn,False,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,

*""At this stage I would say wait and see, don't panic. It might be slightly, subtly more transmissible but it is not something absolutely disastrous like we saw previously.""*

*There is no suggestion that a new update of the vaccine will be needed to protect against any of the existing variants of the pandemic virus.*

The belief only need be sincere - you do not need to be consistent or otherwise an upstanding adherent to your religion.

&gt;Moreover, “a sincere religious believer doesn’t forfeit his religious rights merely because he is not scrupulous in his observance,”[43] although “[e]vidence tending to show that an employee acted in a manner inconsistent with his professed religious belief is, of course, relevant to the factfinder’s evaluation of sincerity.”[44]  

&gt;...

&gt;For example, although prior inconsistent conduct is relevant to the question of sincerity, an individual’s beliefs – or degree of adherence – may change over time, and therefore an employee’s newly adopted or inconsistently observed religious practice may nevertheless be sincerely held.[48]  Similarly, an individual’s belief may be to adhere to a religious custom only at certain times, even though others may always adhere,[49] or, fearful of discrimination, he or she may have forgone his or her sincerely held religious practice during the application process and not revealed it to the employer until after he or she was hired or later in employment.[50]  An employer also should not assume that an employee is insincere simply because some of his or her practices deviate from the commonly followed tenets of his or her religion, or because the employee adheres to some common practices but not others.[51]  As noted, courts have held that “Title VII protects more than . . . practices specifically mandated by an employee’s religion.”[52]

This isn’t about saving the antivaxxers, if they want to die I guess I can’t stop them. But the more unvaccinated people there are, the higher the chances of the vaccine not working properly. If you have 100 people in a room, and 1 of them is vaccinated while the others are not, that guy is not fully protected from the virus. The vaccine significantly lowers your chances of getting the virus, and significantly lowers the risk of having a serious illness, but if you’re constantly bombarded with the virus from every direction those odds become higher and higher. The bigger the unvaccinated population is, the bigger the risk for *everyone*, not just them. 

Also, even if it was only the unvaccinated who were affected by this, the people who are willingly choosing to let themselves get the virus end up overflowing the hospitals, taking beds that could have gone to other people who need them (for other issues, not just covid). So more unvaccinated people=more preventable deaths not being prevented. They’re also overworking the healthcare workers and exposing them to covid at higher rates, which also hurts other sick people. They are basically destroying the healthcare system because they just feel like it. 

This is not a matter of personal choice, everyone is in danger here. This is nothing like cigarettes (although I’d argue that because of second hand smoking smokers are also hurting other people and not just themselves, but whatever), this is a movement of people who are actively destroying society and killing millions for no reason.

In this study, over 6 times more people were hospitalized with covid like illness from the vaccinated group, vs unvaccinated and prior infection. Further, they include results from Jan 1 this year and only include vaccinated for over 90 days. Well, hardly anyone was vaccinated for over 90 days until May this year, so all hospitalizations in that window couldn't even include a that category. Yet still, over 6 times more people were hospitalized when vaxxed vs natural immunity. Therefore I think this study's numbers actually strengthens the Israeli study. 

It's truly insane how they present this headline, after looking at the study's numbers.

I will add that both of my kids have egg allergies and since flu and MMR are grown on chicken egg embryos- we were worried about them getting those vaccines. They are all fully vaccinated without anything more than the typical side effects (mild fever, sleepy for a couple days, etc) - most vaccines are overall very safe for almost everyone! Science is wonderful :)

Only one that ever kicked my ass was Rabies Pre-exposure series (3 vaccine series). Second vaccine basically gave me flu symptoms for 3 days and knocked me out. But I have some amazing titers to Rabies now so...definitely worth it (in a field where I work with animals and its required for the job).

I'm a high school teacher, English literature. Once, in a space where we were on some kind of break at my school I was asked if I could sub in a 2nd grade classroom. 


In my brain ""I've dealt with little kids before, I'm the oldest of 7. I've been a teacher a few years. I should be able to handle that! 'Okay sure I'll do it'""


I quickly realized that I was I'm over my head when ""JOHNNY WROTE ON MY ARM WITH A MARKER!!!"" ""Johnny? Did you..."" (I now see Johnny had not just wrote on this other child but was now consuming the markers and choking in an effort to destroy the evidence)


(I deal with that best I can, then) I am ready to start explaing how to ""Carry the one"" when adding. ""So when you are adding 9 and 9, how many will you have?"" (Most of the class) ""TWO NINES!"" ""Right...""


Or in other words- all of this is to say you may THINK you know how to do something like judge the deadlines of a disease or your risk to it vs vaccine perhaps even because you have an education in another field. But the compartmentalization of that understanding does not necessarily directly translate to other fields that each require their own education and experience. This mismatch is how otherwise educated people can do things that are objectively stupid.  


Or, in other words, or, simply put

Just because you can do something, doesn't mean you can teach it. It's a completely different skill set. And ppl may THINK they know just because they know other things, but that's often the something that leads ppl to make those bad choices, an overestimating of their own understanding.

&gt;Unvaccinated people who had previously recovered from a coronavirus infection were five times as likely to get Covid as people who had received both shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, the C.D.C. said.

&gt;The study’s authors cautioned, however, that certain gaps in patient data and biases in their study participants could have influenced the results.

&gt;”We now have additional evidence that reaffirms the importance of Covid-19 vaccines, even if you have had prior infection,” said Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the C.D.C. director, in a statement accompanying the release of the report.


&gt;The question of whether people who have had Covid really need a shot has gained traction among some Americans as vaccine mandates take hold across the country. Scientists have urged Covid survivors not to skip the vaccine, noting that the strength and durability of so-called natural immunity depends heavily on people’s age and health, and the severity of an initial infection.

&gt;The C.D.C. study used a roundabout experimental design. The researchers examined roughly 7,000 people hospitalized this year with Covid-like illness across nine states. They then looked at how many of those hospitalized patients were indeed infected with the coronavirus. The odds of testing positive for the virus were considerably higher among unvaccinated, previously infected patients than they were among vaccinated people.

&gt;The study comes with several caveats, however. The researchers cautioned that the findings may not translate to non-hospitalized people with different levels of access to medical care, and that some patients in the vaccinated group may unknowingly have also had previous infections.

&gt;The researchers also noted that separate research in Israel had failed to show that vaccinated people were better protected than those who had only been infected. In general, scientists said, studies on the topic had drawn contradictory conclusions.

&gt;Still, some patterns have emerged. Two doses of an mRNA vaccine produce more antibodies, and more reliably so, than a coronavirus infection does. But the antibodies from prior infection are more diverse, potentially helping people fend off variants.

&gt; Whatever the effect, doctors have warned that acquiring natural immunity is perilous and uncertain. Not everyone survives Covid in the first place, and those that do may not be able to count on a vigorous immune response.
