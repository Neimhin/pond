THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Police fired warning shots, injuring an unknown number of people, as riots broke out Friday night in downtown Rotterdam at a demonstration against plans by the government to restrict access for unvaccinated people to some venues.

Police said in a tweet that “there are injuries in connection with the shots” during the violent unrest. Riot police used a water cannon in an attempt to drive hundreds of rioters from a central street in the port city.

Video from social media shown on Dutch broadcaster NOS appeared to show a person being shot in Rotterdam, but there was no immediate word on what happened.

Police said in a tweet that it was “still unclear how and by whom” the person was apparently shot.

Late Friday night, police said downtown Rotterdam remained restive and there was still a heavy police presence on the streets.

Police said they arrested dozens of rioters and expected to detain more. They said about seven people were injured, including police officers. They did not give further details.

Photos in Dutch media showed at least one police car ablaze and another with a bicycle smashed through the windshield.

Local political party Leefbaar Rotterdam condemned the violence in a tweet.

“The center of our beautiful city has this evening transformed into a war zone,” it said. “Rotterdam is a city where you can disagree with things that happen but violence is never, never, the solution.”

Police said in a tweet that rioters started fires and threw fireworks during the rioting and authorities closed the city’s main railway station.

Local media say gangs of soccer hooligans were involved in the rioting.

The government has said it wants to introduce a law that would allow businesses to restrict the country’s coronavirus pass system to only people who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 — that would exclude people who test negative.

The country has seen record numbers of infections in recent days and a new partial lockdown came into force a week ago.

In January, rioting broke out in Rotterdam and other Dutch cities after the government announced a curfew in an attempt to rein in soaring coronavirus infections.

Earlier Friday, the government banned fireworks on Dec. 31 for the second straight year. The ban is intended “to prevent, as much as possible, extra strain on health care, law enforcement and first responders,” the government said Friday.",,,,1637394173,{},hld2o1z,True,t3_qxvd5q,False,False,t3_qxvd5q,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qxvd5q/rioting_erupts_in_rotterdam_over_coronavirus/hld2o1z/,1637746994.0,17,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_3nelaphm,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although, that states there isn't a lot of them, but could be from past exposures? Who knows. Although, I'm sure if pangolins carry it other animals there do as well. 

However, bats in Asian countries carry similar coronaviruses as well, and some have been hit quite hard. Although, we may not come into contact with bats as much as humans with the exception of wet markets. 

So it's hard to say if pervious exposures play in. It wouldn't be suprising though. There are many viruses even in the US we haven't identified.

Yes, that is true. I was about to get vaccinated more than once but then decided to get tested for antibodies instead to see if the vaccine was necessary.

I am not a doctor. All I know is that when I got tested for antibodies for the last time which was a month ago I had more than TWICE as much antibodies than when I got tested for the second time. And the second time I got tested I had a lot more antibodies than the first time.

There are multiple explanations for the increase of antibodies but ultimately neither you nor me can know for sure. My doctor said that it’s an ongoing immune response but unnoticed reinfections could also be the cause. 

You are not in the position to say that my antibodies are decreasing at this point with 100% certainty. I would need to get tested again in order to verify or falsify your statement. 

What we can say with 100% certainty is: 
My risk of passing the virus onto someone else is a lot lower since I came into touch with the virus and my immune system formed antibodies as a response. It’s not guaranteed but vaccinated people can pass on the virus as well. Ultimately the same mechanism is at play but healthy recovered people in general seem to have a stronger and longer lasting immune response than healthy vaccinated people which is a fact that most virologists are agreeing upon. A breakthrough infection is more likely to occur than getting covid-19 as a recovered person for a second time even though that does happen to some people as well unfortunately.

In my case and in the cases of many many more people there’s just no necessity to get vaccinated from an epidemiological standpoint because the antibodies do not only protect yourself from a reinfection but also protect others by lowering the risk of transmitting the virus. 

You on the other hand are in all likelihood trapped in a vaccination spiral. Nobody can tell for sure how long the protective effect of the third vaccination is going to last but multiple politicians are already discussing a fourth vaccination. There’s a good chance you’ll have to get vaccinated every four to six months. Good luck with that. 

While you’re trapped in your vaccination spiral I on the other hand am going to jail once and then I’m going to walk freely. It just seems to be the better option for me personally and I’m fine with it.

[],,EroticMatter,,,,,,[],"No, that's not how genetics works. Genetic diversity doesn't mean they don't share most traits. It's mostly about many small meaningless traits being tiny bits different. 

You can't assume genetic diversity causes or prevents a virus because genetic diversity on it's own doesn't really mean anything specific. 

That's like assuming all people with blue eyes would get COVID at the same rate just because they have some superficial genetic trait in common. You won't be wrong 100% of the time, but you won't be right enough of the time to call it science. 

It really matters WHERE the genes have diversified, not the total volume of diversification AND more important it mattes how the specific virus reacts to all that, because it might not give a flying fuck how genetically diverse you are.

If the virus uses a very basic trigger available in most mammals or most animals, the genetic diversity between them is not likely to matter because the virus is using such a basic  hook that the biology requires for it to infect is always there OR the organism can't survive because it's genetically defective.

In general a virus is not going to care about random genetic diversity because viruses don't target most of those genes, hence why there aren't tons of viruses that only infect certain people rather most viruses infect all people. Virus don't evolve to use highly specific genetic hooks, because that's not a good propagation strategy and the virus would usually die off. 

COVID is infecting humans and cats, and rats and all kinds of animals, so if it's genetics it's more likely something people were exposed to in Africa that changes their genetics across the board, not due to diversification.

If minor changes in DNA was enough to stop COVID you wouldn't see it in all kind of non-human animals.. AND remember this things came from animals, so it's not like it evolved specific for humans. It can even infect birds and reptiles! You're going to need some amazing genetic diversify to span the diversity between mammals, birds and reptiles that the virus already covers. 

A more likely scenario is some virus common to Africa has given them increased resistance and because we don't pay attention to every little virus OR Africa we would never notice that. Like.. if your get Africa common cold coronavirus maybe you become a lot more immune to COVID19 that if you get Asian common cold coronavirus AND maybe there are a lot more common cold coronaviruses running around out there than we realize since we don't test enough for that and just say OH  WELL it's just the common cold.",,,,1637384314,{},hlcoq4y,False,t3_qxmr13,False,False,t1_hlcjkk3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qxmr13/scientists_mystified_wary_as_africa_avoids_covid/hlcoq4y/,1637739930.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_739uhkx3,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agreed. I'm in the US but in my county (Ventura County, CA) no one's really checking vaccine cards for anything yet, nor is there yet a rule that mandates vaccines for anyone to be able to do particular things.

[],,PanEuropeanism,,,,,,[],"Worrying data on increasing case rates of infections, hospitalisations and deaths across Europe have provoked a range of measures to reduce the spread of Covid-19 this week.

The tightening of restrictions, particularly on those who have declined immunisation or proffering evidence of immunity from transmitting the disease, has reopened ugly fissures between proponents of personal responsibility and critics of communal coercion.

Austria’s government confirmed today that it plans to make vaccination against coronavirus mandatory for all citizens from early next year, making it the first European country to do so. Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said that it was time “to face reality” as he announced a new three-week lockdown for all Austrians.

But between the rights or wrongs of political debates over a growing wave of tightening measures across Europe, the increasing strains on health services and squeeze on economic activities in the lead up to the festive season remind us that for many this Christmas will not be a much hoped for return to pre-pandemic Yuletide normality.

Dr Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, warned yesterday that the continent faced “a hard winter ahead” despite the success of vaccination programmes in allowing the easing of preventive measures and unlocking of economies over the year.

“But far too many remain unvaccinated, so we have pockets in which the virus continues to spread and cause strain on local and national health systems,” he told the BBC.

His remarks came just a day after departing German chancellor Angela Merkel warned that a fourth wave of Covid-19 was “hitting our country with full force”, as health agencies announced a record daily case rate of over 65,000.

Much of Germany and Austria are now covered by variations of so-called 2G restrictions — a reference to German words geimpft and genesen for vaccinated and recovered — that preclude significant minorities of unvaccinated people from non-essential shops and social events. Dutch MPs also debated the move this week.

Similar restrictions on leisure activities, encouragement of homeworking and enforcement of “Covid passports” for entry to events have been rolled out elsewhere in recent days, including in Ireland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.

Vaccine passports enjoy substantial support across Europe, according to a YouGov survey published today in the Guardian.

The survey, which covers 10 countries, suggests there is majority backing for mandatory vaccine passes to access large events as well as support in most territories for them to be required in cafés, restaurants and gyms.

The British may fetishise their National Health Service and the Americans their healthcare innovations and star doctors, but when seen through the lens of coronavirus, other countries — from Taiwan to Norway — have served their citizens’ health better.

Zoologists fear wildlife could become a reservoir of infection that could be transmitted to people. Two studies showing high levels of Covid-19 infection among wild deer in the US have renewed concerns about the virus spreading through animal populations.

Genetic engineering research has made some fear the next pandemic could be lab-made.

Vaccines: Pfizer is seeking regulatory authorisation in the US for its Covid-19 antiviral pill, which has been shown to cut the risk of hospitalisation and death in adults by nearly 90 per cent in late-stage studies.

Yeah because the American strategy is to not care about the anti-vaxxers. You saw it here too: ""My partner and I are vaccinated but we're still taking precautions to protect our kids.""

Hospitals will be on the brink of collapse but we don't care about that because we can just send someone to a hospital several states away.

But this should also be a good reason why natural immunity might be better than vaccination. I've heard first hand reports from nurses that the the antibody tests sometimes can't measure the threshold for antibodies 6 months after infection. And other reports about people testing positive for covid 2 or 3 times. Also, there are reports that T cell immunity might be more important than antibody immunity. And also reports that antibodies against the nucleocapsid proteins are important as well.

Yes for some people, particularly older people. But the risk/benefit ratio isn't as clear cut for younger people.

I'm convinced they are that effective against the original strain. I'm seeing conflicting data though. Even the healthline article said it could be as low as 60%.

But you need to get 3-4 shots of DTaP/TDaP as a kid and boosters every 7-10 years for the levels of protection you note. It’s not uncommon for new parents to be recommended a booster of TDaP because pertussis immunity wanes rather quickly. 

Boosters aren’t all that weird among lots of vaccines. Especially if you go to places where the viruses are more prevalent. 

You don’t get influenza vaccines annually because it’s a multi-dose, it’s because influenza has dozens of strains and they wax and wane in prevalence.

We’re learning more about this virus and immunity, but what it seems to be is that we need to spread doses apart similarly to childhood vaccines and likely need 3-4 rounds to create that longer-term immunity. Then we’ll likely need boosters here and there (that data will be forthcoming) to keep the protection levels high. 

Kids will likely need 3-4 in childhood along with polio, DTaP and Hep. It’ll be like the rest of the vaccines. That’s fine.

But GLOBAL vaccination efforts (which is most comparable to current covid situation as it is also a global pandemic and vaccination effort) began in 1959 and it was considered eradicated by 1980. 

Again, there were no smallpox surges following widespread/worldwide vaccination which resulted in eradication. 

This is very much applicable to our current issue, because this is a worldwide vaccination effort to minimize covid. 

Have we had smallpox surges since vaccines were available globally? No. Because high enough compliance had a LOT to do with it.

[],,leopard_eater,,,,,,[],"I think I may have gotten covid in Sydney in February 2020. It started with a fever and I ended up in hospital for two days, delerious and unable to get the fever down. Because I’d had a mastectomy a couple of weeks earlier, they were treating me as though they were investigating sepsis, and even tested me for the flu, found nothing, I felt a little better, flew back to my home state.

Then I coughed for nearly three months, my stitches burst, I developed pneumonia and had three different types of antibiotics to clear it and got restitched up. My home state was locked down by this stage, people were dying, Telehealth or the ER were the only options, so I had no follow up.

It wasn’t until about August when my husband read that covid sufferers were losing their taste and smell, and I realised that I hadn’t been able to smell for months. At that point I called the doctor, but there were no antibodies tests in our state so I’ll never know.

The reason I didn’t process not smelling for a while was because I had been confined to our house inside our rural property, not moving very much at all, and eating quite bland food so as not to get sick from coughing, for quite a few months. There wasn’t anything new to smell or taste. It has since intermittently returned to normal, but I often get days of confusing rotten smells or smells that don’t match the item. To be honest I’ve found it very depressing as I love food and smells and the confusing intermittent nature of my olifactory ‘recovery’ has actually been worse than if it was just gone for good.

[],,smaller_god,,,,,,,"&gt; Our assumption that cellular immunity would remain effective at preventing infections has since been proven wrong by real world data.

In hindsight, I'm sure sure there were field experts that did not assume this.  
In fact, in the history of vaccines, vaccines that can actually completely prevent infection are the rarer achievement.

The whole thing was a colossal messaging fuck-up from media and public officials. I'm not sure where it started exactly now, I fell for it for awhile too and almost was pretty concerned when I learned my Pfizer shots had reduced to like 50% immunity (from infection).  
Then I fortunately ran into some credited and saner voices that explained to me how this actually worked.

https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02516-4

&gt;Murray is not alone in finding the Israeli results insufficient to justify boosters. A review2 published on 13 September by a team that includes two high-ranking FDA scientists cites a preprint3 of the study and notes that the short-term protective effect documented in Israel “would not necessarily imply worthwhile long-term benefit”.

I'm afraid I have to side with the skeptics in the article yet.  
Not because I know my shit like they do, but even as a laymen I'm still sitting here having to ask ""what's different?""  There doesn't seem to be any argument based on the immune system's function explaining why the booster will result in longer immunity from infection.  

https://www.timesofisrael.com/pfizer-booster-shot-could-offer-protection-for-9-10-months-initial-data/

&gt;The booster shot yields more antibodies, and the antibodies are also better at preventing the disease, the channel quoted people involved with the study as saying.

&gt;By analyzing the antibody levels, researchers have concluded that the third shot could be effective for 9 – 10 months, or even longer, the researchers predicted.

When they say ""more antibodies"" do they mean more antibodies than right after the original shots?  Or just more antibodies than before the booster?  It seems  a pretty important distinction.

Yeah, I know we could theoretically help prevent infections by boosting forever now, but it just seems odd to me.  And I'm not sure there aren't any costs there.

If only clinical trials, the data shouldn't have surprises as Pfizer has already been administered to hundreds of millions over an even longer period than the initial trials were and I don't know anyone who's had any concerning reactions.  If anything, every day that goes by with good news reaffirms the safety of all vaccines out there.  Especially as it keeps getting approved for younger age groups, and especially another 1-2 years from now when all your Pfizer vaccinees are still standing just fine.

Conspiracy theorists will disagree, but I'm not convinced Pfizer would have received full FDA approval if there truly were nasty surprises.  Especially now that it's encouraged for children as well.

Dr. Philip Krause and Marion Gruber, FDA scientists who voted no on whether boosting should be allowed:

""The message that boosting might soon be needed, if not justified by robust data and analysis, could adversely affect confidence in vaccines and undermine messaging about the value of primary vaccination""

... 

""The limited supply of these vaccines will save the most lives if made available to people who are at appreciable risk of serious disease and have not yet received any vaccine. Even if some gain can ultimately be obtained from boosting, it will not outweigh the benefits of providing initial protection to the unvaccinated. If vaccines are deployed where they would do the most good, they could hasten the end of the pandemic by inhibiting further evolution of variants. Indeed, WHO has called for a moratorium on boosting until the benefits of primary vaccination have been made available to more people around the world.""

While stillbirths were rare overall, representing fewer than 1 percent of all births, 1.26 percent of the 21,653 women with Covid experienced a stillbirth, compared with 0.64 percent of women without Covid. Even after adjustments were made to control for differences between the groups, women with Covid were 1.9 times as likely as healthy women to have a stillbirth.

The risk of stillbirth has been even higher for women with Covid since the Delta variant has been dominant: while the risk of stillbirth for women with Covid was 1.5 times as high as that of healthy women before July, when Delta became dominant, it was 4 times as high between July and September. As many as 2.7 percent of deliveries to women with Covid were stillbirths during the period studied while Delta was dominant.

“There had been reports suggesting an increased risk, but stillbirths are hard to study, because luckily they are uncommon,” said Dr. Denise Jamieson, chief of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory Healthcare. “This is some of the strongest evidence of the increased risk, and probably the strongest data pointing to the risks specifically tied to Delta.”

The take home message is the importance of vaccination for pregnant women, particularly at this point in the pandemic with Delta circulating,” she said.

The C.D.C. strongly encourages pregnant and breastfeeding women and women planning or trying to become pregnant to be vaccinated against Covid, but resistance has been strong, even though pregnancy is on the C.D.C.’s list of health conditions that increase the risk of severe disease.

Studies have shown that pregnant patients who are symptomatic are more than twice as likely as other symptomatic patients to require admission to intensive care or interventions like mechanical ventilation, and they may be more likely to die. They are also more likely to experience a preterm birth.

Another C.D.C. study issued Wednesday described the cases of 15 pregnant women in Mississippi who died of Covid during their pregnancy or shortly afterward, including six who died before the Delta variant became dominant and nine who died between July and October, while Delta was dominant.

Of the women who died, nine were Black women, three were white women and three were Hispanic women. The median age was 30. Fourteen of the women had underlying medical conditions, and none were vaccinated. Five of the deaths occurred before vaccinations were available.
The study concluded that the risk of death for a pregnant woman with Covid is nine deaths per 1,000 infections, while the risk of death from Covid for other women of reproductive age is only 2.5 deaths per 1,000 infections.

A third study by C.D.C. researchers found that pregnant women with Covid faced a more than 60 percent higher risk of being admitted to intensive care, needing a ventilator or special equipment to breathe, and even of dying during the period that Delta was dominant, compared to pregnant women during the period before the variant was dominant.

All but one of the women who died had underlying health conditions, and none had been fully vaccinated. The second report found that the risk of stillbirth increased about fourfold for women with covid-19 as delta surged.

COVID-19 | Sinovac vaccine recipients currently make up some 84 percent of the serious breakthrough Covid-19 cases treated at Hospital Sungai Buloh.

Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin disclosed this today, highlighting waning immunities and encouraging more to come forward for booster jabs.

“Why a shorter booster interval for Sinovac (three months) vs Pfizer or AstraZeneca (six months)?

“While Sinovac is effective, there is evidence its effectiveness wanes sooner.

“This is Category 4 and Category 5 weekly admission (numbers) into Hospital Sungai Buloh.

“That is why we want you to take whatever booster is on offer,” he tweeted along with a chart showing vaccination data of patients at the dedicated Covid-19 hospital.


Category 4 refers to Covid-19 patients with lung infections who need oxygen support.
Category 5 refers to Covid-19 patients with multiple organ failure who need ventilator support.

Covid-19 breakthrough cases refer to those who catch the disease despite being vaccinated.

Based on the chart shared by Khairy, Sinovac recipients made up an overwhelming majority of serious breakthrough infections at Hospital Sungai Buloh, rising to more than 100 in recent weeks. 

Pfizer vaccine recipients who develop serious infections have increased slightly to above 20 in recent weeks while serious infections involving AstraZeneca recipients have remained mostly in the single digits.

Nationwide, almost 50 percent of the fully vaccinated population received Sinovac. Pfizer recipients make up 36.3 percent while Astrazeneca recipients make up 13.7 percent.
Single-dose Cansino recipients account for 0.1 percent of the population.

Covid-19 cases are rising throughout the Klang Valley, the Health Ministry previously warned.
Booster rollout

As for the Covid-19 vaccine booster rollout, the government is presently offering Pfizer, Sinovac, and AstraZeneca vaccines as boosters. 

Boosters are prioritised for frontliners, people aged 40 and above, people aged 18 and above who have comorbidities, workers and residents at long-term care facilities, pregnant women, and those who require it for overseas travel.
Appointments are being handed out through MySejahtera without the need for registration.
However, those eligible can also sign up to be on a waiting list beginning next Monday (Nov 22) at private healthcare facilities.

A list of the participating healthcare facilities will be available from ProtectHealth Corporation’s website when registration opens. They can also contact the facilities by phone or email.

ProtectHealth is a Health Ministry-owned entity that liaises the private sector’s involvement in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.

[],,snakesnake9,,,,,,[],"There's something I've been thinking about when it comes to motivating people to get vaccinated in places where there are large proportions of unvaccinated, and that is to give a clear goal/benchmark for when fully normal life will return (and that has to be the end goal here, not living indefinitely in a quasi state of war). 

The issue with a lot of European nations who have been re-imposing restrictions is that these restrictions just seem never ending, like an endlessly recurring nightmare. Excluding the unvaccinated from sections of society I'm not sure is really productive for bringing people together, and just divides the population into groups that resent each other, and that can't be good. People aren't really working towards a common goal. 

What I think could help is if a government that is currenetly imposing some sort of restrictions says that ""*when we hit x% vaccinated* (and I don't propose to know what that % is) *then life goes back to full normality""* (i.e no more masks, Covid passes, social distancing, tests, etc). 

This gives a clear metric according to which things are judged, and motivates people to go and get jabbed as there is a clear end benefit (I know the benefit is improved health, but that message clearly hasn't been sufficient so far so we need to try new things). It gives everyone an opportunity to do their part in another clear way. Because at the moment someone who's unvaccinated might think that even if they get jabbed, nothing will change - they still have to wear masks, they still have to prove their vaccination status anywhere, so why bother. This gives a second tangible benefit, and makes everyone pull together. It also increases social pressure on hold-outs to vaccination. Meaning people would tell their friends/family members who are unvaccinated that 'hey because of you I have to show a Covid pass everywhere/my small business can't have as many customers as it would like'. 

Right now we're just in an endless depressing sea of restricitons, but this would show clear light at the end of the tunnel. 

Now the counter-argument to the above is that what if we do hit that x% vaccinated in the population, but infection rates are still high. Well I personally still arrive at the same conclusion that we still open up fully, we've done everything we can and living under restrictions indefinitely is both mentally and economically unsustainable.",,,,1637406957,{},hldhgny,False,t3_qy0whe,False,False,t3_qy0whe,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qy0whe/daily_discussion_thread_november_20_2021/hldhgny/,1637754554.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_93nzw,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],,mossiv,,,,,,[],"I'm doubled Pfizer vaxxed and currently getting over covid. It is one of the most dreadful experiences of my life. Smell wise, everthing just smells of fousty human waste. Taste wise I lost it all for 5 days solid. The recovery is dreadful, I can only taste things that are really high in a certain area, e.g salt, spice and sugar. Somethings taste ok like cherry tomatoes but other things like water melon make me wanna throw up. Texture is extremely hightened now, so junk food is much more forgiving e.g. cakes, pies, wet biscuits etc. My Mrs told me my clothes smelt fousty and dried bad but I couldn't smell it, so I'm worried I'll turn into one of those smelly people that I really can't stand. 

Taste is just a minor problem compared to the rest of the symptoms. The pain my body is in is excruciating, my mouth is swollen, my teeth hurt, I've had the most painful headache of a lifetime (I'm a migraine sufferer), my joints are sore. I feel like my chest is fine until I have to do 15 minutes of exercise, something as simple as putting the vacuum over then I have horrendous coughing fits and the constant vomitting is gross. It tastes mild but it burns like a mofo. 

I took a 15minute walk with my dog yesterday because I really needed fresh air and exercise and I slept for 3 hours off the back of it.

For reference, I am 29 years old, I'm reasonably healthy although I do have asthma. My BMI is 22, I am a bit ""skinny fat"" but 5ft 8 @ roughly 148lbs. I walk my dog daily, go through phases of running and going to the gym so by no means a couch potato but no means an athlete either. I'd just comsider myself normal. 

I followed all precautions with Covid even after the UK opened back up. I caught covid from my daughter who cought it from school. What's worse is I'm entitled to no financial help through my sickness.

This means that unless a new vaccine is developed that can totally stop the spread, this virus will in the end reach everyone. The people with a weak immune system, or those who can't be vaccinated, they will be exposed to the virus not long after we release all restrictions, which we have to do at some point.

Being vaccinated reduces the risk you die yourself (which I would say, is a choice best left up to the person), and it reduces the speed of the spread, which reduces the load on the hospitals. Reducing the speed of the spread, however, can also be accomplished with restrictive measures, whether only on unvaccinated people or on everyone.

Went right to an urgent care for a rapid test and yep, positive. Two weeks of quarantining wasn't so bad, as I was already working from home full time, and could afford grocery deliveries.

Seven months later and smell has gotten better, but definitely not back to normal. Random meats give me that ""sewage"" smell that gets mentioned. It's not like sticking my head in a trash shoot, but more like walking past a dumpster in an open area. Not unbearable, but definitely not an odor I'd like to stay around.

Garlic is non existent. Went to a hot pot a few weeks ago (all fully vaccinated). I added so much minced garlic but there was just nothing.

Chemical sprays, like scented cleaners, smell dusty, like I just walked into a storage area that hasn't seen the light of day for 20 years. Rubbing alcohol is kinda there, but mostly not. Dove body wash smells sorta kinda ok, but Pert Plus shampoo is fairly muted.

It's not one big thing, but a thousand tiny ones. I so far can't smell the additive to natural gas that's added to alert people to its leak. But I can smell smoke from wood fires.

Long term is hard to think about, as there seems to be shifts in reactions over time. Trending better, but I'm not hopeful to normalcy. And that's combined with the difficulty of remembering what was normal. Imagine if you didn't see a certain color for a while, such as a certain red from autumn leaves. Then one day you realize you hadn't seen it and seek it out, only to not find it. How do I describe what's missing? I can convey general ideas, but unless I'm holding the thing, it's frustrating. Half of a sense is gone, but I don't know which half, and some days it's 60% (or 45%, or 56.4%, etc).

As an individual, I'll cope. I'm getting older so the body wears down in new ways anyway. For everyone though, we're limping along. We've added a significant disability that's likely to present in strange ways.

They tried to mask a lot of this by throwing around ""The data doesn't support boosters"", but the data has been there for a while.  If anyone has been paying attention, they probably noticed a very swift pivot from discussions of VE against symptomatic infection, ability to control spread, to VE against hospitalization alone as soon as WHO started their crusade on boosters.  All of a sudden vaccines were still very effective and no one but the most vulnerable needed a boost.

&gt;In vitro, ivermectin has antiviral effects against several distinct positive-sense single-strand RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.[97] Subsequent studies found that **ivermectin could inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 in monkey kidney cell culture with an IC50 of 2.2–2.8 μM.**

This is what  THEY latched on to for their ""research"".

But

&gt;Based on this information, however, **doses much higher than the maximum approved or safely achievable for use in humans would be required for an antiviral effect**.[100][101] Aside from practical difficulties, such high doses are not covered by **current human-use approvals of the drug and would be toxic**, as the antiviral mechanism of action is considered to operate by the suppression of a host cellular process,[100] specifically the inhibition of nuclear transport by importin α/β1.

Basically it could shut down the virus, but the amounts needed to shut down the virus are so high, that it would shut you down for good long before it did anything to the virus.

Also, there are lots of animals both wild and domestic that carry the virus and will reintroduce it into the human population even if humans would somehow get rid of it.

Hard lockdowns at this point are useful to stop healthcare from being overloaded, but can’t effectively be used to cut cases long term.

When there were no vaccines, that strategy was useful to delay the wave until people were vaccinated. Now, not so much.

Amongst them, 27 (37.5%) patients showed persistent dysosmia and were all included in this study. Nine participants received oral corticosteroids and performed olfactory training (OCS + OT), while 18 performed olfactory training (OT) only. Only participants in the OCS + OT group had significantly improved their olfactory score and did so above the minimal clinically important difference for subjective improvement of smell (p = 0.007). Three of the participants who received oral corticosteroids reported minimal and transient side effects.

[],,Kriztauf,,,,,,[],"So I've been giving this a lot of thought recently. The way I see it, we've now got a lot of tools to prevent the health-care system from getting overloaded but no one is really using them together effectively. At this point in the pandemic, I think the governments' have the ability to focus on protecting society's health care infrastructure and resources by minimizing the amount of strain on them, while still allowing for social activity as much as possible. I'm also including nurse/physician manpower as a resource here, and that is currently what most short in supply.

The three big categories people and governments should be focusing on are Prevention, Awareness, and Education, and how the three relate to each other. The government's role should be to facilitate these three things and I believe that if done effectively, lockdowns shouldn't be necessary at this point. They all relate to each other as well and can create a synergistic system that reduces burden on hospitalizations while maximizing on personal freedoms to a broadly reasonable degree during a pandemic. 

So going more in depth:

**Prevention** - Preventing health infrastructure from getting overwhelmed. Vaccines, wearing masks, and getting treatment all minimize the amount of resources needed to treat covid patients. Vaccines obviously are very good at preventing hospitalization, so it's important to have a well vaccinated population. Masks (N95's specifically since they're most effective) cut down on transmission rates so that people are less likely to spread it in public, meaning less people will all be getting sick at the same time, preventing acute strain on hospitals. 

Early treatment is also very key here and I don't see people emphasizing it enough. I'm not going to get into ""prophylactic treatments"" outside of staying healthy and vaccinations because of all the controversy and misinformation surrounding the topic. Anyways, it's much more resource intensive to treat severely I'll covid patients in the ICU than it is to treat covid patients at the beginning of their illness when they're most responsible to the treatment options we have. We have decent treatment options at the moment, but soon we'll have new covid specific antivirals on the market that are even more effective at preventing hospitalizations. The key with this though is that they need to be administered early, before so much damage has accrued in the person's body that the only thing doctors can do it put them on organ support treatment like vents and dialysis and hoping for the best.

**Awareness** - Until things get more under control, we really need to be relying on testing more so that people will know when they're covid positive and can quarantine until they've recovered to reduce transmission rates. Regardless of what the vaccination requirements are, for the time being everyone should have to show negative tests when entering into non-essential public places and events, avoiding restrictions on what people can do while at the same time reducing the odds people will be out in public spreading it around faster.  We need to minimize those infection chains to reduce strain on hospitals. 

I'm living in Germany and they have free testing centers everywhere and a 3G/2G system that basically required that people going to non-essential public places to present proof of vaccination, recovery, or a negative covid test. Then last month they switched to 2G, where people need to have either proof of vaccination or recovery. Removing the emphasis on testing was a mistake though. I believe the rational was that it didn't really matter if vaccinated people caught it since they're less likely to get hospitalized. This is in theory true, but during huge outbreaks like the current one, having a lot of people, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, catching spreading around covid at once increases the chances that the people prone to needing hospitalizations will all catch it in short succession as well. So making sure people are aware of if they need to isolate will reduce that strain. 


**Education** - Honestly, this seems like the least feasible of the three. I'm not sure how you reach people who've gone down the antivax rabbit hole. But I think teaching people why these things are important, especially how to use testing effectively and why it's important to get treated early, will cut down on how severe outbreaks are. Basically we need to empower people to know how to use the tools we have most effectively.

Hospitalizations are increasing among fully vaccinated people, and especially over age 40.  So, if that's the only metric that matters, everyone over 40 (or 50 depending on the data) should get a booster to avoid hospitalization.

The willfully unvaccinated are difficult to convince, gains in vaccinations there will only be small and incremental.  It might take many more boosters to avoid hospitalizations and deaths than from initial vaccinations, but it's also generally easier to convince people to get a booster dose than an initial one.  Of course, we can and should be doing both in order to temper the current surge as much as possible.

This is not true. The risk for Moderna has not been quantified at all as far as I'm aware. The risk of myocarditis from the Pfizer vaccine appears to be lower than the risk from Covid, but there is evidence to suggest that the current administration protocol (in most jurisdictions) of not aspirating syringes  before injection may increase this risk greatly.

[],,-WhatAreYouHiding-,,,,,,[],"This would only be true if unvaccinated people would stay at home at all times to be no influencing factor in the pandemic. Which as we all know - they do not. 

In a perfect world - everyone would be vaccinated, the virus would still spread, that much is true and this can not be stopped - it will become endemic. Experts say as much. We will have to live with it for the rest of our lives or until vaccines are developed that make spreading impossible or straight up 100% destroy the virus. 

Big difference is - almost no one would die! Health care wouldn't be overworked and understaffed for the situation.
Relevant Info: vaccinated people can still spread the virus but the time in which they do is greatly reduced. The possibility of spreading is also somewhat reduced. The possibility of other vaccinated people to get the virus from another vaccinated person is also reduced. And best of all - the virus load from a vaccinated person to another vaccinated person is a lot less likely to develop into a bad state of the virus. The chances are never 0, but all those effects accumulate into a far better situation than we have now with tons of people willfully endangering other people's lives by not getting the vaccine.

Therefore unvaccinated people, bare those that have no contact at all with other people, actively endanger the lives of other people in the same way a drunk driver or a smoker smoking in your face would, with the added property that covid-19 is at least at the moment of transmission a lot more likely to cause your death than a random person blowing smoke at you.",,,,1637417587,{},hldxb5e,False,t3_qxcmdk,False,False,t1_hldvw16,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qxcmdk/austria_enforces_mandatory_vaccination_starting/hldxb5e/,1637763239.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_130gqq,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In my understanding, this means that 2 doses of the vaccine did in fact induce long-lasting immunity, just the andbody level decays after a while.

Some of this I'm sympathetic to - it was a mysterious, new disease - but often they were doing things that we KNEW were wrong. 

First, at the onset of the pandemic, they specifically told us not to wear the.masks because they didn't do any good.  This was a crucial misstep that would have implications for the duration of the pandemic. 

Second, just as the Delta variant emerged, they effecfively gave the country blanket permission to stop masking, naively relying on anti-vaxxers to abide by the honor system and keep their masks on. This was a deadly mistake that seems to have made the Delta toll worse and exacerbated the mask culture wars. 

Third, as Delta raged and leaders worldwide knew that vaccine effectiveness waned after six months, the government discouraged most adults from getting boosters. They even shamed those who took matters into their own hands and figured out ways to get boosted. We KNEW at this point everyone would need boosters, but our public health leadership acted as though this was a question mark. We missed a narrow window to have clear communication that everyone should get a third dose and instead made situation as ambiguous as possible for a public that was confused at best and hostile at worst.

""The adjusted risk for stillbirth was higher in deliveries with COVID-19 compared with deliveries without COVID-19 during March 2020–September 2021 (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 1.90; 95% CI = 1.69–2.15), including during the pre-Delta (aRR = 1.47; 95% CI = 1.27–1.71) and Delta periods (aRR = 4.04; 95% CI = 3.28–4.97). COVID-19 documented at delivery was associated with increased risk for stillbirth, with a stronger association during the period of Delta variant predominance.""

aRR means adjusted risk ratio. So Pre-Delta, infected women are 40% more likely to have a stillbirth, which was already bad, but post-Delta, they are **400% as likely to have a stillbirth**, which is just awful. 

I hope this help some pregnant women make up their minds about vaccination.

For example, very early on in the coronavirus pandemic Donald Trump decided to ban all air travel from China. If you were a US citizen you would be allowed to fly back home, but you were told to hurry up about it. Absolutely no air travel was to be coming in to the United States from China. This was a prudent move at that time. 

Did the enlightened left say this was sad to have to do but good science and smart to stop international air travel from China very very early on in the pandemic?

No, they called him a xenophobic racist. They made the whole entire pandemic an issue of race. Nancy Pelosi was literally walking around Chinatown in San Francisco desperate to find any Asian American people to hug her on camera. The whole thing was absolutely ridiculous.
