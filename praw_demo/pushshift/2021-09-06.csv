[],,Waldondo,,,,,,[],"let's try it the other way then. There is a lot of stuff to cover so let's try to break it down and do an ELI5. Coronaviruses are known for immune evasion. They can resequence their code when translating with other viruses. Be it other coronaviruses or the flu, or even the vaccine if it's RNA based. This is why not testing people that are getting vaccinated because we are in a haste is a bad move. This alone can create mutants. It's a shot in a billion, but the more people get vaccinated, the more this is likely to happen. RNA vaccines are amazing technology. For coronaviruses and other diseases this is great cause we can adapt it quickly to new variants that pop up. But they also carries that risk. Which can be significantly lowered if we tested people before inoculating them. But we don't. Understandable, it's already hard enough to vaccinate people like it is without adding more steps to it.   


For the rest, there is also the question of vaccinating people in the midst of a pandemic. Not only are there more chances of the virus (or the vaccine for that matter) resequencing itself because it's everywhere out there, but there is another risk. The more people are vaccinated against the original covid strain, the more the original covid strain will die out, giving more space and less competitions for new variants that evade the immunity created by the vaccine or natural immunity gained from covid infection. Best time to mass vaccinate people is before a pandemic obviously. Second best time is afterwards. Most risky time is in the middle of it, like we're doing now, driven by the fear of an economic collapse. Wisest move would have been to just vaccinate people at risk from the og covid strain. (the elderly, people with chronic diseases, etc...) and wait a bit for the rest. Taking our time and letting nature do it's thing.    


The vaccine alone will not give us herd immunity. We need natural immunity as well. And we also need treatments. Those are well under there way with some of them giving great promises. Like this one for example : [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00382-5/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00382-5/fulltext)

&amp;#x200B;

With proper treatment we could lower significantly the risk of long covid for a lot of patients. We could protect the elderly, and we could ride this pandemic out slowly with a mix of all the tools we have against it. Waiting that it's done to mass vaccinate everyone.   


Obviously we didn't go that way. But it is risky. Immensely risky. Because it can create new mutants that are even worse than the delta variant. If we were patient, we'd have to wait a year or two and everything would come back in order. That's why some scientists advocate to accept this pandemic and be wiser and smarter with the measures taken by governments. To keep the population from panicking and dividing themselves everytime we change all the rules of our society every 2 weeks. By doing what we're doing, betting everything on the vaccine and a mass vaccination strategy, we take a huge risk.  
Either this will be over very soon, either this will backfire and we will be in deep shit for the next ten years because we'll have to do it all over again. Learning about the new variants, making a new vaccine, etc...   


A virus is a living organism. It's part of our ecosystem. We evolve with them. They evolve with us. They can't reproduct properly? they will find a way to do so, because that's what it's driven to do. That's what all viruses do. Replicate themselves the best they can. And as is said in jurassic park, nature always finds a way... So it'll take advantage of any opening.   


Coronaviruses aren't polio or measles. You can't wipe them off the face of the earth like that. It's more like the flu in it's behavior.   


If the delta variant was ""ThE PaNdEmIc oF tHe UnVacCiNaTed"" like you boldly claim without anything to back it up, how do you explain what's happening in Israel with the delta variant?  


I'm tired of all this bickering. This should be the time where we all work together to get through this. Physically, emotionally and mentally. You're in good health and you don't want to get vaccinated? Good, the chances of you dying are small and you'll keep the og strain alive, giving some competition to the variants. You are at risk? please take the shot. because we don't want to see you die. You're in good health and you want to take the shot cause you're scared, want to go back to concerts or have a regular life? Perfectly understandable, but please get tested before you do.

They come in presenting a runny nose and cough that they've had for 2 days, test positive, and now we have to keep them in quarantine. We can sometimes release if they agree to stay home, but we are not supposed to. We are supposed to keep them until 2 days of negative COVID tests come through. You don't have to go to the ER for a COVID test, by the way! Stores carry at-home testing, and urgent cares can swab you from your car. Please do this instead. Please.

We also have to consider taking in a likely COVID patient to the exam rooms instead of a more serious patient to reduce infection risk. It takes an hour to clean each exam room afterwards, and we can't screen anyone in there until that is done.

If you only have a light cough, slight fever under 101, aches, the sniffles, and nothing else? Stay home for 2 weeks and relax. You don't need to potentially infect the entire ER just because you feel sick. This happened often enough with the flu before the pandemic, and is so much worse now. We can see you after you've recovered to check for damage. 

However, please come in if you have trouble breathing, chest tightness, discolored lips, fingers, or toes, 103+ fever, delirium, or severe headache.

Fauci has pretty regularly told us not to worry about things we should have been worrying about. Even when he does tell us to do something, it‚Äôs usually a half measure that comes too late. We didn‚Äôt need someone to recommend thinking about wearing two masks, we needed n95s.

To go through it, you are trying to find out the percentage chance of at least a single 1/5000 chance happening out of 365 events. To use your coin flip analogy, let's look at the chance that there is at least 1 heads out of two flips.

Two flips has the following potential outcomes

HH  
HT  
TH  
TT  

Four different outcomes, three of which has at least one heads, so 75%. Up it to three flips and the percentage changes to 87.5%.


Essentially, the only way to not have at least one heads in your series is to only flip tails. The longer your series, the less of a chance to only get tails. The chance approaches zero, but never fully gets there, because as you pointed out, the events are independent and there is a chance, however small, that you continue to always flip tails.

To jump back to covid, the chance of ""flipping tails"" in this instance is 4999/5000 (the chance of not getting covid on a day). Do that 365 days and the chance is (4999/5000)^365= 92.95%.

T cell and B cell immunity is the one that lasts a long time, though. You can think of it like a database your immune system keeps of things it‚Äôs fought off before.

2. Vaccine-induced immunity (against infection) from a 2-dose regime can be long lasting but the time between prime (1st dose) and boost (2nd dose) must be at least 4 months, ideally 6 months. However, due to the urgency of the situation, a middle dose (2nd) was used to provide immediate and temporary immunity. The effective boost (now the 3rd and *final* dose) must be done after 6 months from the middle (2nd) dose.

Delta Surge Means This Is as Good as Global Growth Gets

  
The pandemic‚Äôs summer resurgence is slowing the global economic recovery as the delta variant dogs efforts to rev up factories, offices and schools.

  
Instead of entering the final months of 2021 confident that the acute phase of the pandemic is over, it‚Äôs becoming clear that booster shots may be needed for fading vaccines, workplace re-openings will be delayed and border closures remain. 

  
Data over the past week captured a worldwide weakening as infections hit travel and spending and worsen supply bottlenecks that are dampening manufacturing and trade. Surging gas prices are also emerging as a threat. 

  
In the U.S., hiring sharply slowed to its smallest increase in seven months in August and airport check ins, hotel bookings and dining reservations all show softer demand. Germany‚Äôs key business sentiment gauge deteriorated and China‚Äôs services sector crumbled in August. A global measure of manufacturing slumped.

  
Activity gauges have missed expectations in major economies, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., while Citigroup Inc. warned the recovery could moderate with a deepening divergence between sectors and regions.

  
‚ÄúThe spread of the delta variant is slowing the reopening process and has caused us to mark down growth globally,‚Äù said Robin Brooks, chief economist of the Institute of International Finance in Washington, referring to its revised 5.7% forecast for this year, from 6.2%.

  
That stumble could complicate central banks‚Äô plans to pull away from their crisis support by slowing asset purchases or raising interest rates. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Aug. 28 warned of ongoing slack in the labor market as the pandemic continues, while Australia‚Äôs central bank this week is expected to revisit whether to delay its taper plans amid a worsening outbreak.

  
In Germany, Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank, also cited the risk of a setback in a Sept. 1 speech, while China‚Äôs State Council, the equivalent of a government cabinet, has ordered extra support for small businesses.

  
The severity of the slowdown from here will largely depend on science.

  
Economies with high vaccination rates are allowing policy makers to resist another round of shutdowns, opting instead for targeted measures that include vaccination requirements for public places such as restaurants. Progress on vaccinations means ‚Äúin all likelihood the economic impact won‚Äôt be as severe‚Äù than during previous waves, Weidmann said.

  
Governments will also have greater room to maneuver if vaccines continue to hold up against morbidity, mortality and serious healthcare outcomes, according to David Mackie, economist at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. in London.

  
Emerging economies are mostly struggling to gain the same access to jabs as their developed peers, however. The vaccination rate is 58% in the 39 economies defined as ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù by the International Monetary Fund, compared with just 31% for the rest of the world -- and that leans heavily on China‚Äôs massive vaccine rollout. 

  
Manufacturing and tourism-led economies like Vietnam and Thailand have been forced to close factories and turn away visitors. Southeast Asia is suffering one of the world‚Äôs worst Covid-19 outbreaks, making up the bottom five spots on Bloomberg‚Äôs latest Covid Resilience Ranking.

  
The troubles in Asia across manufacturing and shipping are causing complex and interlinked supply shortages globally. Those disruptions to production can end up dragging on consumer spending and pushing goods prices higher, according to Janet Henry, chief global economist at HSBC Holdings Plc in London. 

  
‚ÄúIn the U.S. and European countries, where vaccination rates are generally higher and re-opening continues, growth is more resilient,‚Äù Henry said. ‚ÄúBut these economies could be affected by delta-related disruptions elsewhere, for instance, factory closures in Malaysia.‚Äù   
That two-speed recovery between developing and advanced economies is only likely to deepen, according to Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis.

[],,itsdr00,#46d160,,02cc5c36-ae80-11eb-a76b-0e911ea99c5d,I'm fully vaccinated! üíâüí™ü©π,light,,"The New York Times Morning Briefing, which is their daily morning newsletter intended to summarize the previous' days news with a focus on one or a few major news events, contained a large section on how rare breakthrough infections are. I wish this was something I could link you all to, but instead I'll just copy its contents here (minus images). Keep in mind, this is the kind of news source that a lot of heavily vaccinated communities (being vague to avoid automod filters) are closely tuned into, and this space in particular has been way off the mark in the past by heavily over-inflating concern and fear about Delta.

&gt;####**One in 5,000**

&gt;The C.D.C. reported a terrifying fact in July: Vaccinated people with the Delta variant of the Covid virus carried [roughly the same viral load](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/07/30/1022867219/cdc-study-provincetown-delta-vaccinated-breakthrough-mask-guidance?campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20210907&amp;instance_id=39765&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;regi_id=79342636&amp;segment_id=68249&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=d3f2d5096392cd94b9435fb883c16017) in their noses and throats as unvaccinated people.

&gt;The news seemed to suggest that even the vaccinated were highly vulnerable to getting infected and passing the virus to others. Sure enough, stories about vaccinated people getting Covid ‚Äî so-called breakthrough infections ‚Äî were all around this summer: at a party in Provincetown, Mass.; among the Chicago Cubs; on Capitol Hill. Delta seemed as if it might be changing everything.

&gt;In recent weeks, however, more data has become available, and it suggests that the true picture is less alarming. Yes, Delta has increased the chances of getting Covid for almost everyone. But if you‚Äôre vaccinated, a Covid infection is still uncommon, and those high viral loads are not as worrisome as they initially sounded.

&gt;How small are the chances of the average vaccinated American contracting Covid? Probably about one in 5,000 per day, and even lower for people who take precautions or live in a highly vaccinated community.

&gt;####**Or maybe one in 10,000**

&gt;The estimates here are based on statistics from three places that have reported detailed data on Covid infections by vaccination status: Utah; Virginia; and King County, which includes Seattle, in Washington state. All three are consistent with the idea that about one in 5,000 vaccinated Americans have tested positive for Covid each day in recent weeks.

&gt;The chances are surely higher in the places with the worst Covid outbreaks, like the Southeast. And in places with many fewer cases ‚Äî like the Northeast, as well as the Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco areas ‚Äî the chances are lower, probably less than 1 in 10,000. That‚Äôs what the Seattle data shows, for example. (These numbers don‚Äôt include undiagnosed cases, which are often so mild that people do not notice them and do not pass the virus to anyone else.)

&gt;Here‚Äôs one way to think about a one-in-10,000 daily chance: It would take more than three months for the combined risk to reach just 1 percent.

&gt;‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a lot of miscommunication about what the risks really are to vaccinated people, and how vaccinated people should be thinking about their lives,‚Äù as Dr. Ashish Jha of Brown University told my colleague Tara Parker-Pope. (I recommend Tara‚Äôs recent Q. and A. on breakthrough infections.)

&gt;For the unvaccinated, of course, the chances of infection are far higher, as Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, the top public-health official in Seattle, has noted. Those chances have also risen much more since Delta began spreading: [here there is a graph showing that Daily average covid cases per 10,000 residents around Seattle, between July 1st and August 26th, is .9 for fully vaccinated and 9 for not fully vaccinated]

&gt;Another way to understand the situation is to compare each state‚Äôs vaccination rate with its recent daily Covid infection rate. The infection rates in the least vaccinated states are about four times as high as in the most vaccinated states: [here is a graph showing an obvious negative correlation between case counts and vaccination rate]

&gt;If the entire country had received shots at the same rate as the Northeast or California, the current Delta wave would be a small fraction of its current size. Delta is a problem. Vaccine hesitancy is a bigger problem.

&gt;####**The science, in brief**

&gt;The science, in brief
These numbers help show why the talking point about viral loads was problematic. It was one of those statements that managed to be both true and misleading. Even when the size of the viral loads are similar, the virus behaves differently in the noses and throats of the vaccinated and the unvaccinated.

&gt;In an unvaccinated person, a viral load is akin to an enemy army facing little resistance. In a vaccinated person, the human immune system launches a powerful response and tends to prevail quickly ‚Äî often before the host body gets sick or infects others. That the viral loads were initially similar in size can end up being irrelevant.

&gt;I will confess to one bit of hesitation about walking you through the data on breakthrough infections: It‚Äôs not clear how much we should be worrying about them. For the vaccinated, Covid resembles the flu and usually a mild one. Society does not ground to a halt over the flu.

&gt;In Britain, many people have become comfortable with the current Covid risks. The vaccines make serious illness rare in adults, and the risks to young children are so low that Britain may never recommend that most receive the vaccine. Letting the virus continue to dominate life, on the other hand, has large costs.

&gt;‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a feeling that finally we can breathe; we can start trying to get back what we‚Äôve lost,‚Äù Devi Sridhar, the head of the global public health program at the University of Edinburgh, [told The Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/28/world/europe/coronavirus-britain-uk.html?campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20210907&amp;instance_id=39765&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;regi_id=79342636&amp;segment_id=68249&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=d3f2d5096392cd94b9435fb883c16017).

&gt;I know that many Americans feel differently. Our level of Covid anxiety is higher, especially in communities that lean to the left politically. And there is no ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù response to Covid. Different people respond to risk differently.

&gt;But at least one part of the American anxiety does seem to have become disconnected from the facts in recent weeks: the effectiveness of the vaccines. In [a new ABC News/Washington Post poll](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/vaccine-hesitancy-eases-teeth-delta-surge-poll/story?campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20210907&amp;id=79791316&amp;instance_id=39765&amp;mc_cid=f45de3eb53&amp;mc_eid=UNIQID&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;regi_id=79342636&amp;segment_id=68249&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=d3f2d5096392cd94b9435fb883c16017), nearly half of adults judged their ‚Äúrisk of getting sick from the coronavirus‚Äù as either moderate or high ‚Äî even though 75 percent of adults have received at least one shot.

&gt;In reality, the risks of getting any version of the virus remain small for the vaccinated, and the risks of getting badly sick remain minuscule.

&gt;In Seattle on an average recent day, about one out of every one million vaccinated residents have been admitted to a hospital with Covid symptoms. That risk is so close to zero that the human mind can‚Äôt easily process it. My best attempt is to say that the Covid risks for most vaccinated people are of the same order of magnitude as risks that people unthinkingly accept every day, like riding in a vehicle.

&gt;####**The bottom line**

&gt;Delta really has changed the course of the pandemic. It is far more contagious than earlier versions of the virus and calls for precautions that were not necessary a couple of months ago, like wearing masks in some indoor situations.

&gt;But even with Delta, the overall risks for the vaccinated remain extremely small. As Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, [wrote on Friday](https://twitter.com/MonicaGandhi9/status/1433808689073328128?campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20210907&amp;instance_id=39765&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;regi_id=79342636&amp;segment_id=68249&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=d3f2d5096392cd94b9435fb883c16017), ‚ÄúThe messaging over the last month in the U.S. has basically served to terrify the vaccinated and make unvaccinated eligible adults doubt the effectiveness of the vaccines.‚Äù Neither of those views is warranted.

C) Because OP editorialized the title and misrepresented what was said, and the authors themselves admitted:

&gt;Based on the current **very low- to low-certainty evidence**, we are uncertain about the efficacy and safety of ivermectin used to treat or prevent COVID-19. The completed studies are small and **few are considered high quality**. Several studies are underway that may produce clearer answers in review updates. Overall, the reliable evidence available does not support the use of ivermectin for treatment or prevention of COVID-19 outside of well-designed randomized trials.

This study does not conclude, as OP wrote: ""Ivermectin useless for preventing and treating COVID-19"". I don't know why /u/DragonSided-D misrepresented the authors of this review.

There is nothing in the review that claims Ivermectin is useless, and the only study eligible for primary analysis saw that of the patients who took Ivermectin to prevent infection, 0 died of the virus. I'm not even sure if anyone in that study even caught the virus or was hospitalized with it.

And there's also an issue with many Ivermectin study where they use it as a last ditch effort to save nearly-dead patients. As far as I know, the claim of Ivermectin's efficacy is that it should be taken before or as soon as infection occurs. If a patient is nearly dead, then the use of the medicine won't do much. And the conclusion reported in the media is that a study showed the medicine doesn't work. Well, it doesn't work under those circumstances, but what about early on in the infection?

FYI - I am not an anti-vaxxer and have never even known about anti-vaxxers until a few years ago through social media. However, I'm not going to support fallacious or outright false assertions. The stupid narrative of painting Ivermectin as just a horse dewormer as if it isn't actively used in humans all around the world to treat various ailments is just ridiculous. Horses also eat food that we eat too, are we going to start making fun of people for eating apples and call them horse snacks?

I think the evidence for the efficacy of Ivermectin is a bit shaky. As far as I know, the initial spark for using the medicine as a treatment for covid came from an in vitro study where it was found that a high concentration of the medicine stopped the viral replication of covid. However, the dosage needed to reach that concentration is dangerous, although I'm not sure if they've followed up that study with lower concentrations to study its effects. I am personally waiting on the British ongoing study before I make a final judgment, but I am not going to lie about scientific reviews like what OP did to pretend like we have evidence that the medicine is ""useless"".",,,,1631024472,{},hbxmvao,False,t3_pjmiec,False,True,t1_hbxh1lb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pjmiec/review_of_14_studies_ivermectin_useless_for/hbxmvao/,1631091952.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_5z35as62,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Severe cases of the flu will give you similar ""long flu"" like symptoms that persist months to years after you clear the virus. 

There is also the potential that *some* long covid symptoms are in our head. The media is playing up long covid as if getting covid means you are *guaranteed* to experience permanent long term health conditions. Naturally if you've had covid, clear it, and then have a day you feel ""off"" or ""lethargic"" it can't be because you're dehydrated, or hypoglycemic, experience a side effect of a new prescription, or something as simple as you slept funny the night before...it *must* be long covid.

Long covid needs to be studied more but based on the research out there a few things seem to be true:

- Getting vaccinated definitely will help prevent long covid.

 ""Ivermectin for Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 Infection: A Systematic Review, Meta-analysis, and Trial Sequential Analysis to Inform Clinical Guidelines""

Places like India, Mexico, Peru have been using Ivermectin. India has 1.3 billion is 11% vaxed and had 30,000 new cases and only +290 new deaths with almost 42,000 new recovered. We heard all about India when they could push the fear theme, crickets now...

  Uttar Pradesh has a population of 104 million, they have 235 active cases. ""The Uttar Pradesh government has claimed that it was the first state to have introduced a large-scale ‚Äúprophylactic and therapeutic‚Äù use of Ivermectin and added that the drug helped the state to maintain a lower fatality and positivity rate as compared to other states.""

People are talking about Ivermectin like they are Tide pods. ""Ivermectin is a well-known medicine that is approved as an antiparasitic by the World Health Organization and the US Food and Drug Administration...it is one of the World Health Organization‚Äôs Essential Medicines. With total doses of ivermectin distributed apparently equaling one-third of the present world population"".

I'm not saying Ivermectin is the answer but the constant dismissal of it and the media trying to make it a joke ""it's sheep dewormer"" or ""it's for animals"" makes me skeptical. 

Ivermectin has been around for over 30 years, and the patent is expired. It can be readily made and for cheap. Then their are the vaccines which are under patent, and cost significantly more.

[],,spinningfarts,,,,,,[],"Oh, I see your confusion on pandemic vs endemic. Yeah, when it's used in this sense the meaning shifts a bit. It's more of a function of rate-of-spread than it is geographical limitation.

Epidemic is a disease that is growing out of control in a specific area, pandemic is exponential growth worldwide, and endemic means stable rate-of-spread in a certain area. That certain area can be the entire world, or an entire continent, or the entire world minus new zealand, but the key point is that the disease's rate-of-spread is no longer exponential.

[https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/epidemic-endemic-pandemic-what-are-differences](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/epidemic-endemic-pandemic-what-are-differences)

&gt;It will circulate, until another mutation happens and then become pandemic again over and over and over again.

Again, this isn't how disease mutations work. Now that the world has resistance to the infection, a mutation isn't going to cause another pandemic. There may be exponential spread but there won't necessarily be exponential \*sickness\*. That's just not how disease evolution works. And covid will mutate much more slowly than, say, influenza because it doesn't have the RNA shuffling that influenza does.

&gt;From the data we see already we wont have permanent immunity.

Lol, what? The data doesn't not depict this at all.

We observed significant reduction in the sperm counts and sperm motility of the patients tested. On the morphology there was significant increase in the number of abnormal sperm cells. This took the forms of two heads, double tails, white (albino) sperms and extraordinarily large heads. It is suspected that the above alterations in the already determined parameters of the patients‚Äô sperm cells could only have occurred as a result of their treatment with iv–µrm–µctin.  
  
... As for the morphology of the sperm, there was a rise in the abnormal sperms after treatment compared with the morphology before the commencement of treatment. These changes no doubt are as results of the effects of the drug on the sperm function of the patients. Although, there were no noticeable changes in the sperm volumes, sperm viscosity and the sperm liquefaction time the results of this study is enough to cause infertility in these patients.

Here (slide 28+) the antibody neutralization (an excellent metric for protection vs infection) is higher after the third dose vs delta than it was after the second dose vs wildtype.  We could easily be looking at the original 95% protection, or even higher, against infection again.

But without phase 3 trials we can't prove it, and nobody's running them.  So we're just waiting on real world data to give us some type of approximation.

We also haven't seen measurements of cellular response, only antibodies.  The data strongly suggests that (after vaccination, not after infection) antibodies are the main driver against infection, but that cellular response is what (somewhat) reduces severity if you are infected.

What‚Äôs kinda interesting is you said there‚Äôs zero data to support increased illness, then you argued about it. (I‚Äôm not OC, fwiw.)

The huge increase in widespread infection in children, and especially young children, is a serious public health problem. 

So yes, this wave more serious than Alpha. 

And yes, we‚Äôre still in the midst of a highly transmissible Delta wave. Research as to virulence is ongoing. 

And yes, hospitalizations from covid are 10x higher in unvaccinated adolescents. 

**Preventing further unmitigated spread and the resulting increase (yes, even proportionally) is severe ‚Äî and must be a public health priority.**

Here are the two studies: 

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7036e1.htm

&gt; COVID-19 cases, emergency department visits, and hospital admissions increased from June to August 2021 among persons aged 0-17 years. **Emergency department visits and hospital admissions in a 2-week period in August 2021 were higher in states with lower population vaccination coverage and lower in states with higher vaccination coverage.**

&gt; **Community vaccination, in coordination with testing strategies and other prevention measures, is critical to protecting pediatric populations from SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19.**

And:

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7036e2.htm

&gt; Weekly COVID-19‚Äìassociated hospitalization rates among children and adolescents rose nearly five-fold during late June‚Äìmid-August 2021, coinciding with increased circulation of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. The proportions of hospitalized children and adolescents with severe disease were similar before and during the period of Delta predominance. **Hospitalization rates were 10 times higher among unvaccinated than among fully vaccinated adolescents.**

&gt; **Preventive measures to reduce transmission and severe outcomes in children and adolescents are critical, including vaccination, universal masking in schools, and masking by persons aged ‚â•2 years in other indoor public spaces and child care centers.**

And here‚Äôs the prior article: 

&gt; **Increased transmission of the delta coronavirus variant has coincided with higher hospitalization rates among those under the age of 18, according to a pair of studies published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday.**

&gt; **From late June to mid-August, weekly COVID-19‚Äìassociated hospitalization rates among children and adolescents increased nearly five-fold**, according to one of the studies that examined data from 14 states.

&gt; However, the ""proportions of hospitalized children and adolescents with severe disease were *similar* before and during the period of Delta predominance,"" the study said, indicating that the highly transmissible variant *does not seem to* cause more severe disease in children than previous strains.

&gt; ""Although we are seeing more cases in children and more overall cases, these studies demonstrated that there was not increased disease severity in children,"" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said during a press briefing on Thursday. **""Instead, more children have COVID-19 because there is more disease in the community.""**

This is simply not true.  The US by itself donated [110 million doses as of August 3rd](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/03/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-major-milestone-in-administrations-global-vaccination-efforts-more-than-100-million-u-s-covid-19-vaccine-doses-donated-and-shipped-abroad/) (and has donated millions more since then).  A small number of those were to other high-income countries (Canada, Korea, Taiwan, Uruguay) but 105 million of them were to low or middle income countries.  You can maybe shave off a couple more million if you classify some borderline countries (e.g. Panama) as high income, but not 20 million.  And, again, that is just US donations.  The EU has also donated [18 million doses](https://www.devex.com/news/the-eu-promised-200m-vaccine-doses-how-many-has-it-delivered-101551).

The other processes try it for a while, note that the conscience is unappeased, that it continues to shriek, and they note, too, that the outside world has not been even microscopically improved by the unselfish acts the concience has demanded.

&gt;They rebel at last. They pitch the tyrannous conscience down an oubliette, weld shut the manhole cover of that dark dungeon. They can hear the conscience no more. In the sweet silence, the mental processes look about for a new leader, and the leader most prompt to appear whenever the conscience is stilled, Enlightened Self-Interest, does appear.

[],,DeadIronGolem,,,,,,[],"It's not possible to eradicate Covid, vaccines or not. With a virus that has such a high mutation rate and can infect animals, it's just not possible. Even if everyone were completely immune, it could retreat into the animal population and come back as a new variant that can evade antibodies to some degree. As far as I know, there have only been a few viruses that were ever completely eradicated with a vaccine, I think there were 2 of them, one of them being smallpox. Pretty much all other viruses that ever caused a pandemic are still around. Even the plague is still around (though it's a bacteria, not a virus). Pandemics never last forever. 

The virus will not take everyone out. Its death rate is fairly low compared to other viruses (sitting at around 1-2% in unvaccinated people, though that depends heavily on age and other risk factors). The virus has no incentive to become deadlier, all that matters is that it can infect people and outcompete other strains, so there's pressure on it to a) become more infectious and b) become better at evading antibodies, but there's no pressure on it to become deadlier. If that happens (such as in the case of Delta), it's a byproduct of other mutations, but serves the virus no purpose and can even be counterproductive depending on how early into the infection you start feeling like garbage. 

Antibody immunity is what keeps you from getting infected, while t cell immunity is what keeps you from getting hospitalized or dying. Antibodies and t cells recognize different parts of the virus. The parts that antibodies recognize (like the spike protein) are far more likely to mutate than the parts that t cells recognize, due to the pressure to become more infectious and evade antibodies. 

The plan is not to eradicate Covid. It's not possible and it's not the end of the world. The plan is to build immunity in the population as a whole, which will transition us from a pandemic into an endemic situation. Hospitalization and death rates will continue dropping (because people who are vaccinated or got Covid before don't get as sick, if they get sick at all), and the virus has fewer people it can infect at once, meaning it doesn't spread as rapidly. Seasonal effects will be stronger and at some point it will be comparable to the flu, even if it isn't now.

Creating an updated booster shot for a variant with significant immune escape will not take as long as it took to make and approve the first vaccine, because all that Pfizer etc would have to do is switch out the mRNA sequence to that of the new virus. I think Pfizer estimated it would take a couple of months. They haven't done it because it's not necessary yet, as a 3rd booster shot with the same vaccine works just fine against Delta and even people with only 2 shots are significantly less likely to get seriously sick or die. 

It is also very unlikely that there will be a variant that evades antibodies entirely. The spike protein also binds to our cells because it has to enter them if it wants to reproduce. The spike protein can only change so much if it still wants to be able to bind there. 

So no, we won't all be wiped out by Covid. The media is full of clickbaity fear porn because it's what gets people to read their stuff. You should listen to Covid experts and ignore most of the stuff on the news, otherwise you will just go crazy. They have been selling the narrative that everything will continue to be terrible for the rest of our lives and we will never get out of the pandemic, but that's just not true. We will, we just won't eradicate the virus.",,,,1631002209,{},hbwpiiu,False,t3_pj27n0,False,False,t1_hbvxixg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pj27n0/finland_to_lift_covid_restrictions_after_80_of/hbwpiiu/,1631075788.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_1yfypi9z,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 At least here in Sweden that doesn't seem to be the case. It's an anecdotal observation on my part though so just my impression which could be wrong of course.

 My impression here in Sweden is that many vaccinated people think they are immune after being vaccinated. Heard someone for example excitingly say he felt like a cow being let out on pasture in spring (we have a term for that here, hard to translate into English). And that finally we could shake hands. Many seem to be like him, anxious to return to normal life. Thinking they are immune.

 Also you have to take into account that vaccinated people are less likely to notice if they are infected. Also some will disregard any symptoms they might have of infection since ""it can't be covid since they are vaccinated"".

So there is an argumentation for an unvaccinated person being more likely to stay home if they have some symptom. 

All in all though I would say it's impossible to tell for sure of course. If I had to guess I would say there is not a big difference between vaccinated/unvaccinated following regulations seen from a Swedish context.

You ask for sources for a lot of things, but the nature article you shared, and that is just a month more recent than the one I shared, covers a lot of what I said so I don't really understand what you want? You also seem to brush off other important points I made.   
As for viruses being alive, they are in a gray area and you probably know that. That's just fussing and bickering.   


""Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses that possess the largest viral RNA genome, \~27‚Äì32‚Äâkb in size.""   


that's from your nature article. 27-32 kB in size is huge for a RNA sequence. Even if it restricts how much it can mutate, it can still mutate... If it didn't, there wouldn't be all these variants out there... And that's just what we can see with a sophisticated ph tester. It's not like we systematicly sequenced the genome of the virus of every person with covid out there. So we just see the obvious strains.   


""Who? I have not seen nor heard any credible scientist vying for letting the virus run its course instead of vaccinating. None. I'd love to know who you see promoting this.""  


Dr Christian Velot comes to mind, molecular genetician at the university of Paris-Saclay and president of the scientific comitee of CRIIGEN. I don't like putting up just the guy that promotes this idea though, as I don't like to see science in black in white, so one of his big oponents is dr Alain Fischer from the college of france. (College of France that is awesome by the way cause you can find all their lectures online.) Both those guys have shitloads of credentials and have been arguing about this for quite some time now.   


""Yes, it can if you vaccinate enough. It can't while you have 20-30% of your population refusing it. Herd immunity doesn't mean 0 infections/cases, it means few cases, and the ones that happen are less severe, and any outbreaks are highly localized clusters that struggle to spread.""  


\- But 70-80% was supposed to be enough they said. Now it isn't anymore? Allow me to have serious doubts about this.

What would you suggest the feds do?  They spent billions sponsoring the development of describe vaccines, that are distributed and administered for free.  Testing for covid is free. A majority of treatment for covid (to date, anyway) has been free. Monoclonal antibodies are free. Remdesevir is free. Steroids are free. They offered door-to-door outreach vaccination teams to go into areas that might have problems getting shots, and were told they'd be shot.  FEMA isn't coming because states have to request FEMA and the governor would rather the state burn.

At what point do the people of Texas take responsibility for the spread of disease among themselves?  They could stay away from each other - that would keep the virus at bay.  They could wear a mask - that would help limit the spread. They could get vaccinated - that would lower the infection rate and the hospitalization rate and the death rate.

We have steroids and emergency inhalers, but those don't get rid of inflammation entirely, it reduces it ENOUGH to not die, make coughing more productive to remove excess mucus and hopefully let the body have enough time and unrestricted movement to naturally reduce inflammation. That's the same issue with covid-19. The body reacts to proteins made by the virus, it freaks out and inflammatory responses go crazy, and if you don't catch it early and limit how much virus is reproducing and releasing these proteins, you've gone over the tipping point and now you better hope the inflammation can be reduced by your body before you die.

&gt; The study, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal on Friday, is an analysis of more than 40,000 coronavirus infections in England. It adds to evidence suggesting that Delta may cause more severe illness than other variants do.

&gt; Fewer than 2 percent of the infections occurred in fully vaccinated people, and there was not enough data to draw firm conclusions about hospitalization risks in that group specifically, the researchers said.

&gt; ‚ÄúThe main takeaway is that if you have an unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated population, then an outbreak of Delta can lead to a higher burden on hospitals, on health care, than an Alpha outbreak would,‚Äù said Anne Presanis, a senior statistician at the University of Cambridge and one of the study‚Äôs lead authors.

‚Ä¶

&gt; The Delta variant, which was first detected in India, is roughly twice as infectious as the original virus and as much as 60 percent more transmissible than the Alpha variant, which was first identified in Britain.

&gt; In the new study, researchers analyzed the health data of people who tested positive for the virus in England from March 29 to May 23, as Delta was spreading through the country. Seventy-four percent of people were unvaccinated, 24.2 percent were partly vaccinated, and 1.8 percent were fully vaccinated.

&gt; Genetic sequencing confirmed that 80 percent of the study participants had been infected with the Alpha variant, while 20 percent had been infected with Delta.

&gt; For both groups, the risk of hospitalization was small, the researchers found. Just 2.2 percent of people with Alpha and 2.3 percent of those with Delta were admitted to the hospital within two weeks of testing positive for the virus.",,,,1630988311,{},hbw6j3m,False,t3_pj0soe,False,True,t1_hbvx59b,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pj0soe/the_delta_variant_is_making_covid_a_pandemic_of/hbw6j3m/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_bz91eiwq,False,False,False,d749c748042b1ea49ef71e58c85c929affb9c1f3,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1630988321.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,,

https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions

Now it would be very worrisome if all of a sudden the Delta variant started declining in its distribution (cases as a percent of all cases). So for instance if Delta, which is now at 98.1-99.8% of ALL cases in the US, rapidly became replaced with another variant, that might indicate a worrisome future because maybe it would mean that the new variant is stronger in some way (more contagious, resistant, etc.) Since the article mentioned the decline there, in ""mid-July"" I would add that at the beginning of August, the CDC stated that the Delta variant accounted for 93% of all Covid cases, which basically replaced all other variants as by far dominant. That means that the Mu variant and every other variant, at that time from ""mid-July"" would have gone down significantly as a percentage due to the Delta, and since then only accounts for &lt;0.3% of all cases (it's doesn't even have it's own line on the CDC Variant page see other). That's not to say that it couldn't evolve into the next big strain, it's possible like you winning the lottery, but Delta and it's future evolutions are what real scientists are watching closely.

""88 % of eligible population fully vaccinated against covid

Is vaccination data the path to full deconfinement? Is it goodbye to the mask? PS has already said it will not renew but Parliament does not meet until the 15th. Authorities have not decided.

The latest data from Health indicates that almost eight million Portuguese have the full vaccination against SAR-CoV-2. If we add the million inhabitants in Portugal under 12 years of age who will not be vaccinated, it means that the country is close to 90% of the target for immunity through the vaccine. Does that mean we are close to total deconfinement? Is it goodbye to the mask? The Assembly of the Republic only meets on the 15th. And the authorities have not yet decided.

The government had planned the third and final phase of the deconfinement for October, the month in which it was estimated that 85% of the Portuguese population would have been fully vaccinated. In the meantime, some of the stages have been brought forward but, for example, discotheques remain unopened, 18 months after the first case of the pandemic was registered in the country.

Another issue is related to the use of the mask outdoors - a measure that has to be approved by the Assembly of the Republic (AR). And, as DN reported on Thursday (2 September), the law requiring the use of masks outdoors will expire on Sunday. It was proposed by the PSD, which abstained in the last vote, passing the law with Socialist votes, which, it said, did not justify its extension.

This Tuesday, the PS will discuss the non-renewal of the legislative measure in a leadership conference and schedule the issue for the AR, the party's advisory office told DN. Parliament will only reopen on September 15, three days after the law expires. It also remains to be decided whether the country will move towards total deconfinement.

The On Word In Data database from Oxford University in the UK indicates that, as of Monday, 76.85% of the Portuguese population has the full covid vaccination. That's 7 952 355 people. DN used the estimates of the resident population of the National Statistics Institute (in December there were 10 298 253), since the Censuses of 2021 do not have the distribution by age groups. It indicates that there are 1 079 198 children between 0 and 11 years, a population group that Portugal has not planned to vaccinate, as happens in most other countries. It is also the opinion of scientists.

Taking the youngest children out of the equation, it means that 88 per cent of the Portuguese population has been fully vaccinated. Last week, DN questioned the Directorate-General of Health about whether the goal of group immunity meant the entire population, or just those eligible for the vaccine. No reply was received.


Vaccination slows down
The vaccination task force confirms that there are no plans to vaccinate children under the age of 12. As for group immunity, the basis is the total number of inhabitants in the country, 10 347 983, according to the 2021 Census, explains a source from the task force. Last week, 274,000 people were fully vaccinated. And on Sunday, 7.6 million of the inhabitants of the Continent had the two doses of the vaccine (in the case of Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca) or one (Jonhson). To which must be added 300 thousand total vaccinees from the Azores and Madeira, that is, the nearly eight million On Word In Data.
If we take into account those who took at least one dose, it increases to 87.69% who are in this situation and 98% of the eligible population.

In the last two weeks there has been a slowdown in the vaccination process, which led to the dismantling of some Covid Vaccination Centres. The exception are the weekends, period in which there is a reinforcement of inoculation in the youngest. Last weekend 151 thousand users were vaccinated, of which 110 thousand young people between 12 and 17 years old finished the process. Next weekend it will be the turn of a second large group of these ages.

In the 50 to 64 age group, the percentage of fully vaccinated users is 92 per cent. And it reaches 99% in those aged 65 and over, according to the latest vaccination report from the DGS

Numbers tend to stabilise
The virologist Pedro Simas stresses that it was the Government decided the goal of 85% of the population fully vaccinated to achieve group immunity, not agreeing that it has not moved to the general opening. He argues that the end of masks on the streets should have happened in July, when the 60% vaccinated was reached, following the example of what the UK and Israel did.

""They were criticised, but the pandemic risk had already disappeared. Portugal has entered an endemic phase of covid-19, the number of new daily cases will not drop much further. And from the 60% of the population vaccinated, from the moment that the risk groups are vaccinated, the serious consequences of the disease decrease exponentially. And it is good that the coronavirus circulates among the vaccinated population, since it increases immunity"", explains the scientist from the Institute of Molecular Medicine.""",,,,1631007997,{},hbwvyat,True,t3_pjjunp,False,True,t3_pjjunp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pjjunp/in_portugal_88_of_eligible_population_fully/hbwvyat/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_qgl32,False,False,False,0abd56f08dec114c1e59105533db0d39993dbce9,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1631008009.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,,

I think part of what‚Äôs fucking everything up is our inability to think of the virus as what it actually is.  It‚Äôs a horrible little machine that makes more of itself by hurting people, that‚Äôs all it does.  Sometimes it makes errors when it‚Äôs doing that, sometimes those errors make it better at doing that, and then things get worse.

People have this weird habit of trying to put rules on this awful little self replication machine, and in doing so they kind of anthropomorphize it.  Somebody said fifteen minutes is a contact, so people adopted fourteen minute rules for workplace interactions.  People decided surgical masks were some kind of panacea, so you have people wearing those and giving no thought to actually avoiding walking through a cloud of virus.  People decided bars and restaurants need to stay open and it‚Äôs impossible to just give them money to stay closed, so we have wacky situations where people wear a mask between the door and their seat and then instantly take it off and leave it off for an hour in a crowded room.  

This is all openly insane, and it all stems from an almost religious belief that the virus is a small, evil guy who has to follow certain rules, and that you‚Äôre safe as long as you follow the rules designed to thwart the awful little man that‚Äôs trying to kill you.  Meanwhile, it‚Äôs still a little machine that builds more machines, and sometimes it accidentally makes a really good new one.  It doesn‚Äôt care that you‚Äôre following the rules, it *can‚Äôt* care about anything, it just prints.

If mu can pop around or through vaccines and it dies out suddenly anyway, this is still bad news, because that‚Äôs one more thing that any other case could produce at any time, anywhere in the world.  It is truly, definitionally random.  If mu dies out, that doesn‚Äôt mean we killed a devil and he took his knowledge to the grave with him, it just means that one didn‚Äôt work this time.  That mutation isn‚Äôt copyrighted, it can happen again later at a more opportune moment, and we‚Äôre taking no steps to stop it.",,,,1631012571,{'gid_1': 1},hbx1jct,False,t3_pjap6n,False,False,t1_hbvntf3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pjap6n/new_mu_covid_variant_now_found_in_49_us_states/hbx1jct/,1631081707.0,233,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,3,[],[],text,t2_2uhlz4j3,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,AdwokatDiabel,,,,,,[],"&gt; Why are so many hospitals reporting such problems if they could ""easily make more beds""?

Fear mongering.  On a given day most ICUs are operating 80-90% capacity.  So that metric is ultimately meaningless.  If the need to create more beds arises you do the following:

1. Call in staff who are currently off-duty.
2. Re-allocate staff from one area of the hospital (of lower criticality) to the ICU.

The biggest difference between an ICU versus a normal bed is the ratio of patients to nurses, usually going from 7~9:1 to about 2-3:1.  So you need double/triple the nurses.  

So what's the story here?  If your metric is ICU beds, then that number is variable given the demand for beds.  If there are 0 COVID patients, the hospital will shrink the number of ICUs to accommodate.   An appropriate metric is ""staffing utilization"" then? 

&gt; Are your medical professional reletives the same people informing everyone ""you know, they're just writing 'coronavirus' on people who get in car accidents!"" too? I find it difficult to believe entire states are too stupid to just ring up your relatives and figure out this incredibly simple issue they seem to be struggling with.

Well this depends on who is having the issue here... the hospitals aren't the ones out there dramatizing the lack of beds, but local/national media outlets.  The reason being is to generate fear as a form of control.  Scare people to mask up, or get vaccinated, etc.  It's a valid tactic, but pointing that out isn't inherently wrong.

&gt;Orrin Heatlie, 52, a retired Republican sheriff‚Äôs sergeant from Yolo County, said he was at home recovering from a bout of the coronavirus on Tuesday.

&gt;‚ÄùThought I was immune as I‚Äôve had it before,‚Äù Mr. Heatlie said in a text message, adding that he is unvaccinated. ‚ÄúThen spent 13 hours in a warm truck traveling back from Wyoming with a friend who came down with it on the trip.‚Äù

&gt;The pandemic has played a major role in fueling the recall, which had been regarded as a long shot when Mr. Heatlie and a small group of grass-roots Tea Party activists began circulating petitions in 2019.

&gt;Their initial complaint with the governor arose from his stances on the death penalty and immigration, which they disagreed with. But when Mr. Newsom initiated stay-at-home orders, classroom closures and other health restrictions to slow the spread of the virus, recall supporters added those upheavals to their list of grievances against him.

&gt;In November, a judge granted them an extension to continue circulating petitions because Mr. Newsom‚Äôs health orders had made it harder to gather signatures. That extension allowed Mr. Heatlie‚Äôs group to gather the nearly 1.5 million signatures required to bring the proposed recall to a vote ‚Äî an effort that was helped along when a maskless Mr. Newsom was seen dining at an exclusive restaurant with friends, after he had asked Californians to stay home to avoid spreading the virus.

&gt;Throughout the campaign, the recall supporters have blasted the governor‚Äôs mandates to get vaccinated, socially distance and wear face masks. Mr. Heatlie said his wife, who is vaccinated, had caught the virus from him.

&gt;The acknowledgment came as coronavirus cases, which are surging in other parts of the country, have plateaued in California, which now has some of the nation‚Äôs highest vaccination rates. This week, Mr. Newsom, ahead in the polls, released a new ad warning Californians that Republicans backing the recall will ‚Äúeliminate vaccine mandates,‚Äù and endanger the state‚Äôs recovery.",,,,1631032111,{},hby552h,True,t3_pjqhhn,False,True,t3_pjqhhn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pjqhhn/the_lead_proponent_of_newsoms_recall_has_been/hby552h/,1631101022.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_3nelaphm,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now, a recent article published in Nature offers a more-comprehensive estimate that puts the true number of infections by the end of 2020 at more than 100 million \[1\]. That‚Äôs equal to just under a third of the U.S. population of 328 million. This revised number shows just how rapidly this novel coronavirus spread through the country last year.

[],,aykontakt,,,,,,,"Covid changed the world. I've science geek (enthusiast) for most of my life. Biology is not my strong point so ten years ago I asked on a friendly biology forum in which way the process of evolution can affect our human lives over a short period of time. I got ten of the same answers within an hour: microorganisms, micro pathogens. I obviously agreed and admitted my ignorance. And here we are, living it on the global scale. 

I think in a way, despite of millions of people getting sick and millions dying, this is a wake up call that we are not above nature. We've gone through HIV/AIDS and SARS and MERS and Ebola, bird flus, swine flus among others but we were able to convince ourselves that those things happen to others. Two people I knew died from Covid and in my close family 1, 2, 3 ... about six young people got sick from it. Some of them very sick, ended up in a hospital so this one hit close to home. Heck I probably had it in the very beginning. There were no tests available at that time so I don't know for sure. Not sure if antibody tests would be conclusive now almost two years later.

[],,SmellyJellyfish,,,,,,[],"So I'm going to try being optimistic.

I'm predicting that this current spike will begin falling slowly.  Looking at the 7-day moving average of new cases on the NY Times COVID tracker, it looks like the number of cases are levelling off nationwide; it will likely start trending downwards slowly as the delta wave eases in the south and works its way through the more vaccinated northern states.  Also, [on the website covidestim.org](https://covidestim.org/) the estimated ""effective reproduction number"" is trending downwards in almost every state, which is a great sign.

Thinking about it from a herd immunity standpoint, we have a long way to go, but the US should have a good amount of overall immunity.  The US has 40 million confirmed COVID cases, but I've seen estimates of actual US COVID cases ranging from [2.5 times higher](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/31/e2103272118) up to [*six* times higher (which seems unrealistically high in my opinion)](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-models).  The CDC estimated at the end of May that [there were 120.2 million cases in the US,](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html) and that was well before the current delta wave.  So somewhere between 30-50% of the US population has likely been infected.  Along with 53% of the population being fully vaccinated, this would mean between 68% and 78% of the population has immunity.  Which is still not enough, but that number will get above 80% sooner rather than later once kids can get vaccinated, more vaccine mandates are enforced, and more people get infected and acquire natural immunity.

And I know that there will still be the possibility of reinfection and/or breakthrough infections; COVID will never truly be eliminated and will become endemic.  There will also be more case spikes in the future, particularly around the holidays - we will probably see another considerable spike in cases between Thanksgiving and New Years, though not as bad as the current spike.  But I think once we get into spring 2022, we will approach 80-90% of the population with some level of immunity, and won't see any more huge outbreaks here in the US.  Then it will be a matter of vaccinating the rest of the world.  Obviously there's the potential for a new variant, but from what I've read it's extremely unlikely that a variant will be able to both significantly evade protection from vaccines/natural immunity, and also remain virulent enough to out-compete Delta.",,,,1630968642,{},hbv42a6,False,t3_piubat,False,False,t3_piubat,/r/Coronavirus/comments/piubat/daily_discussion_thread_september_06_2021/hbv42a6/,1631045569.0,25,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_2xcjzn95,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The actual number came in at two hundred and thirty-five thousand‚Äîless than a third of the consensus prediction. Even allowing for sampling error and other factors that make the month-to-month figures bounce around, this was a big forecasting error, and it seems evident that the Delta variant was to blame for it.

From February to July, total employment in the covid-sensitive leisure-and-hospitality industry increased by about three hundred and fifty thousand per month. In August, this hiring stopped dead: the industry added zero jobs on net. Although businesses associated with the arts, entertainment (gambling), and recreation added thirty-six thousand jobs, this gain was more than offset by a loss of forty-two thousand jobs in restaurants and bars. The most convincing explanation is that, as the number of covid cases rose sharply, some people stopped going out, and owners of restaurants and bars reassessed their staffing needs. Such a theory is consistent with OpenTable data for restaurant reservations, which show a significant dip since July. Something similar appears to have happened in the retail industry, where the most recent spending figures‚Äîfor July‚Äîalso came in weaker than expected. The jobs report showed that retailers shed twenty-nine thousand jobs last month, with most of the drop concentrated in food and beverage stores.

The upshot of all this is depressingly clear. Despite hopes earlier this year that mass vaccination would finally break the link between the pandemic and the economy, this hasn‚Äôt happened‚Äînot yet, at least. According to the Labor Department‚Äôs monthly survey of households, which is part of the employment report, the number of people saying that they had been unable to work because their employer closed or lost business rose from 5.2 million in July to 5.6 million in August. Yet another sure sign that the Delta variant is biting: the rate of participation in the labor force among women aged twenty and over, which fell sharply in the early months of the pandemic before rebounding somewhat, slipped again last month.

The good news? ‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt any,‚Äù Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a circular to his clients this weekend. ‚ÄúSeptember likely will be weak too, and we‚Äôre becoming nervous about the prospects for a decent revival in October, given that behavior lags cases, and cases are yet to peak.‚Äù This pessimism could turn out to be justified, but it isn‚Äôt universal. ‚ÄúThe August employment report was very reminiscent of April payrolls, when employment slowed sharply, only to rebound within the next two months,‚Äù Aneta Markowska and Thomas Simons, two economists at the investment bank Jefferies, wrote in another analysis out on Friday. ‚ÄúIf anything, this one will likely be followed by an even quicker/sharper rebound given the likely influx of labor supply in September.‚Äù """,,,,1631023499,{},hbxkoyh,True,t3_pjnoci,False,False,t3_pjnoci,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pjnoci/its_still_the_coronavirus_economy/hbxkoyh/,1631090919.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_g1t74,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It wasn't even a national thing. It was just the fact that all the people saw it as the best solution:

1. It potentially saves you from getting a very damaging illness
1. You're contributing to public health
1. Any potential risks are still much much much lower than Covid's.
1. It's free of charge

Even if you're the most selfish person alive it benefits you. In fact, we even had people trying to skip ahead in the vaccines at first. There's really no reason not to get vaccinated. Portugal didn't do anything beyond being reasonable. I'd say we didn't do anything that should be considered extraordinary, except in the sense that nobody else did it. Politicians, priests, old people, young people, everyone just went ""the vaccine is clearly the way to go if you want to suffer less"", and we went for it. I know of priests that pushed for the vaccine to their parishes because they saw it as the humane thing to do. The God they believe in would not be giving them doctors and vaccines just to test them. 

Like, there's some political issues where being selfish and being altruistic are incompatible, but here it isn't. Unless you value winning the moral lottery on the 0.0001% chance that you were right over actually doing something that has consensus. Even if you're right and this is the one vaccine that gives you zombie-autism, if everyone else is taking it, do you really want to be the only one around to take care of everything?

There is no frame of mind where not getting the vaccine makes sense. It's maddening to me that just common (can we even call it common?) sense became such a rare thing that Portugal, of all places, is the most reasonable country.

You said there‚Äôs zero data and now you‚Äôre arguing about it. ;)

Here are the two studies: 

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7036e1.htm

&gt; COVID-19 cases, emergency department visits, and hospital admissions increased from June to August 2021 among persons aged 0-17 years. Emergency department visits and hospital admissions in a 2-week period in August 2021 were higher in states with lower population vaccination coverage and lower in states with higher vaccination coverage.

&gt; **Community vaccination, in coordination with testing strategies and other prevention measures, is critical to protecting pediatric populations from SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19.**

And:

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7036e2.htm

&gt; Weekly COVID-19‚Äìassociated hospitalization rates among children and adolescents rose nearly five-fold during late June‚Äìmid-August 2021, coinciding with increased circulation of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. The proportions of hospitalized children and adolescents with severe disease were similar before and during the period of Delta predominance. Hospitalization rates were 10 times higher among unvaccinated than among fully vaccinated adolescents.

&gt; **Preventive measures to reduce transmission and severe outcomes in children and adolescents are critical, including vaccination, universal masking in schools, and masking by persons aged ‚â•2 years in other indoor public spaces and child care centers.**

And here‚Äôs the prior article: 

&gt; **Increased transmission of the delta coronavirus variant has coincided with higher hospitalization rates among those under the age of 18, according to a pair of studies published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday.**

&gt; From late June to mid-August, weekly COVID-19‚Äìassociated hospitalization rates among children and adolescents increased nearly five-fold, according to one of the studies that examined data from 14 states.

&gt; However, the ""proportions of hospitalized children and adolescents with severe disease were similar before and during the period of Delta predominance,"" the study said, indicating that the highly transmissible variant does not seem to cause more severe disease in children than previous strains.

&gt; ""Although we are seeing more cases in children and more overall cases, these studies demonstrated that there was not increased disease severity in children,"" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said during a press briefing on Thursday. ""Instead, more children have COVID-19 because there is more disease in the community.""

&gt; **The study also found that hospitalization rates were 10 times higher among unvaccinated adolescents who were eligible for the shot than those who were fully vaccinated.**

&gt; The second study found that during a two-week period in August, coronavirus-associated emergency department visits and hospital admissions for children and adolescents were highest in states with the lowest vaccination coverage.

&gt; Walensky urged those eligible to get the shot to protect children under 12 who are not eligible for vaccination yet.",,,,1630978473,{},hbvnw1e,False,t3_pj0soe,False,False,t1_hbvlytv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pj0soe/the_delta_variant_is_making_covid_a_pandemic_of/hbvnw1e/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_bz91eiwq,False,False,False,408980058428f64f8998d47d3b530392df66df7b,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1630978485.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,,

Do you have a source for this? I was not able to find anything about coronaviruses in general having this capability. They do have several mechanisms that suppress your body's innate immune response, which is why they tend to be more virulent/pathogenic than other common viruses.

&gt; For the rest, there is also the question of vaccinating people in the midst of a pandemic. Not only are there more chances of the virus (or the vaccine for that matter) resequencing itself

My emphasis. What does this even mean.

&gt; The vaccine alone will not give us herd immunity

Yes, it can if you vaccinate enough. It can't while you have 20-30% of your population refusing it. Herd immunity doesn't mean 0 infections/cases, it means few cases, and the ones that happen are less severe, and any outbreaks are highly localized clusters that struggle to spread.

&gt; With proper treatment we could lower significantly the risk of long covid for a lot of patients

[[citation needed]]

&gt; But it is risky. Immensely risky. Because it can create new mutants that are even worse than the delta variant. If we were patient, we'd have to wait a year or two and everything would come back in order.

Except that all the nasty variants, including alpha, beta, and delta have come from unvaccinated populations. When you vaccinate, even if it's not 100% effective at stopping infection, you cut the duration of the infection down by multiple days, and in some cases weeks. This cuts down the number of mutation chances the virus has by multiple orders of manitude.

&gt; That's why some scientists advocate to accept this pandemic and be wiser and smarter with the measures taken by governments

Who? I have not seen nor heard any credible scientist vying for letting the virus run its course instead of vaccinating. None. I'd love to know who you see promoting this.

&gt; how do you explain what's happening in Israel with the delta variant?

Because you don't understand what simpson's paradox is. Basically, it's not a problem with the vaccines or data coming out of Israel, you just don't understand how to read stats or perform a statistical analysis. Here's a good read on it to get you up to speed: https://www.covid-datascience.com/post/israeli-data-how-can-efficacy-vs-severe-disease-be-strong-when-60-of-hospitalized-are-vaccinated

&gt; A virus is a living organism

No, its not. Not in any sort of traditional understanding of the word ""alive"" anyway.

&gt; And as is said in jurassic park, nature always finds a way... So it'll take advantage of any opening.

It's ""life finds a way"", and it does. It's also true that viruses and other micro organisms will find any opening they can. Which is exactly why we need to be giving as few openings as possible and as little time as possible by pushing for as close to 100% vaccination as we can.

Also, as a final note, if you want to actually read the science behind coronaviruses and how they evade the human immune system, this is a pretty good (and recent) paper on the topic: https://www.nature.com/articles/s12276-021-00602-1#Tab1

You'll also want to take note, that coronaviruses literally have an RNA proof reading function in them, which restricts how much they can mutate at any given point. So I would really be interested in seeing your source(s) for claiming they ""resequence their code"" rapidly or when in contact with a vaccine.

There were absolutely arguments to shut down indoor dining, but the outdoor shutdown was never backed by evidence. Remember I lived in the state that remained mostly shut down while we had less than 5k cases per day for a month (a terrible metric in general, but that's a tiny number for a state as large as California). For several months there were no suggestions on how to operate safely - operating at all was banned. Unless, of course, you were catering to Hollywood, lobbyists, or politicians.

Do I believe they'll continue to force restaurants to be takeout forever? No likely not. We've already stopped this for the most part. Do I believe they'll keep/have kept restrictions longer than necessary to limit the spread of COVID? Absolutely. Do I believe we're doing more harm than good as a result of COVID countermeasures? Maybe. That remains to be seen, but the stricter the countermeasure and the less justified, the stronger the chances. We're essentially trading the unknown of COVID for unknowns of economics, psychology, and sociology.

And I also believe our officials are making decisions on ""popular"" opinion rather than on actual science. There was never a scientific justification for an outdoor dining ban other than to prevent people from leaving home at all. The same is true for all the playgrounds and parks wrapped in police tape last summer. These were activities the science would suggest are safe, but we got stuck with politicians scaring the shit out of everyone to justify meaningless policies.

This is the case for viruses that require symptoms for spread. In the case of something like the flu, a flu variant which causes a high viral load along with mild symptoms and low lethality can spread better than a variant which causes severe symptoms and high lethality. This causes a ""pressure"" toward reduced lethality, as this is the better spreading case.

Covid is different in that it is capable of spreading widely during the incubation period before symptoms present, so the pressure on the virus for reduced lethality isn't present.

That's not true.  It only becomes true if you assume a small chance of infection.  But without vaccinating kids, elimination does not seem likely and that chance is not going to be small.

The inactivated and protein subunit vaccines have really good safety profiles, as you say.  It's surprising that wealthy countries are not considering them for kids.

Masks are the least of my concern. I'm opposed to mandates here on principle but they're the obvious path of least harm. Nobody's getting arrested just for masks, though they are getting removed from whatever locations for noncompliance. These are both ultimately good things and I'm not really concerned mask mandates won't go away.

Indoor (and later outdoor dining) was completely banned in my local area for the vast majority of last year. Real estate is the most expensive asset/liability for many of these businesses and large chunks of it were essentially made useless. If that's not businesses forced closed by executive order - I don't know what is. Luckily this doesn't seem to be newly happening, but we're going to be dealing with the fallout of this for quite a while. I doubt we'll return to the point where covid would call for this again, but many people seem to think of this as a simple tool we have when it has incredibly widespread (and not totally understood) impact.

For companies like Google, Facebook, etc, the decision to WFH might be a private decision - these are also the companies who did it before they were told to. For most businesses for most of the pandemic it was not. There are plenty of people saying government should keep things closed longer (because other private businesses won't stay remote). Luckily this hasn't happened, but I'm very concerned the government will consider it. There's also something to be said that I don't like businesses deciding these things either, but that's a different argument entirely.

New York City absolutely has a vaccine passport requirement. The Excelsior Pass itself may not be mandated (since you can show other proof as well), but the requirement to check vaccination status is there. San Francisco now has similar rules. Private businesses are responsible for enforcing these rules, regardless of whether they want to or agree with it. Out of all these policies these are the ones I'm most concerned with.

For the duration of the pandemic (especially when we're stretching medical resources as we are - there's some flexibility for emergencies like this) I'm not *entirely* opposed to this sort of thing, but I'm generally against this being the future norm. I'm hopeful (but skeptical) it won't be.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Authors' conclusions:

Based on the current very low- to low-certainty evidence, we are uncertain about the efficacy and safety of ivermectin used to treat or prevent COVID-19. The completed studies are small and few are considered high quality. Several studies are underway that may produce clearer answers in review updates. Overall, the reliable evidence available does not support the use of ivermectin for treatment or prevention of COVID-19 outside of well-designed randomized trials.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

Back to my comments -- The truth is the 14 studies generally showed positive results with Ivermectin but none of the studies were of sufficient size or quality to be considered proof.  Read the conclusion above again and you'll see he's really complaining about the studies, not the drug.  And yes...I reviewed the 14 studies in question.

That's why I mentioned the references to other studies which have much larger sample sizes. Read. All. The. Words.

&gt; Besides, there1 are2 quite3 a few4 other studies that show people do have antibodies after being infected - anywhere from 98% to 45% (against Delta variant)

Which agrees with the nonseroconversion rates of 5% to 85% in those other studies. Since something like 98% of all sequenced infections in the U.S. are delta, that 45% is a pretty big deal -- that means 55% of people infected with Delta are not immune after infection.

&gt; Having some antibodies is better than no antibodies

&gt;Ivermectin is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of any viral infection.

,,,

&gt;Recommendation    
 &gt;   There is insufficient evidence for the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) to recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19. Results from adequately powered, well-designed, and well-conducted clinical trials are needed to provide more specific, evidence-based guidance on the role of ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19.

,,,

&gt;vermectin has been shown to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cell cultures.13 However, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies suggest that achieving the plasma concentrations necessary for the antiviral efficacy detected in vitro would require administration of doses up to 100-fold higher than those approved for use in humans.

,,,

&gt;The FDA issued a warning in April 2020 that ivermectin intended for use in animals should not be used to treat COVID-19 in humans. 

,,,

&gt;However, most of these studies had incomplete information and significant methodological limitations, which make it difficult to exclude common causes of bias

,,,

&gt;Because most of these studies have significant limitations, the Panel cannot draw definitive conclusions on the clinical efficacy of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19. Results from adequately powered, well-designed, and well-conducted clinical trials are needed to provide further guidance on the role of ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19.

So, based on actually reading the page, it's effective in cell culture but the doses required to get that effect in the human body are 100x higher than what its approved for. None of the clinical trials or studies performed so far have been sufficiently robust, and the results are a mixed bag of ""does nothing"", ""makes it worse"", and ""makes it better"".",,,,1630987068,{},hbw4eai,False,t3_pjdkjk,False,False,t1_hbvvfpt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pjdkjk/judge_says_ohio_hospital_cannot_be_forced_to_give/hbw4eai/,1631064911.0,37,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_efht7,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other people shouldn't have to go to an office for a job that they they can do as well, or better, at home. They should be viable options as employees, not exceptions. There's an inherent bias against working from home that needs to go.

I'm a writer. For example, it makes no sense for someone like me to move across the country to go work in person writing at some youtuber's production studio. I can crap out their shitty scripts from New England, or Mexico, or Tasmania... but, as it stands, I can't get an interview at a bunch of places because they want the person there 40 hours a week.

On top of that, I'm also somewhere on the spectrum, and have anxiety issues. Office environments make me significantly less productive. I work at my own pace and get things done at home.

It's the same way for plenty of jobs. My friend's brother works in customer relations at a phone company. Worked totally fine from home for over a year,  but now has to go back. Why?

I just hope that we get to a point where getting jobs isn't dependent on location. If I'm able to do the job, my physical presence shouldn't be necessary. We don't need to 'go back' to in person.

[],,Synonyms26,,,,,,[],"H√Ä N·ªòI ‚Äî The Ministry of Health said those who have been fully vaccinated still have to comply with anti-pandemic warnings, including social distancing and 5K messages.  
  
In response to a proposal to allow people with two jabs of COVID-19 vaccine to travel and work like normal, minister of health Nguy·ªÖn Thanh Long said the ministry was studying the pilot project for some southern localities.  
  
However, this still has to be implemented with the compliance of social distancing regulations, he said, emphasising that those who have been fully vaccinated can still be infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and pass it on to others.  
  
Deputy Minister of Health Nguy·ªÖn Tr∆∞·ªùng S∆°n said those who have been fully vaccinated, even if infected with COVID-19, would have milder symptoms and a lower rate of becoming seriously ill.  
  
The death rate among people with two doses of COVID-19 vaccine would be also lower than among those who have not been vaccinated or have been given only one jab.  
  
However, a person who has received two injections could still be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and could still infect others. ""The injections do not mean that they are free to travel and do not have to follow the recommendations on pandemic prevention and control for themselves, their families and the community"", S∆°n said.  
  
ƒê·∫∑ng Quang T·∫•n, Director of the Department of Preventive Medicine, Ministry of Health, added that the Ministry of Health currently had guidelines on reducing the quarantine period for people entering the country who have received full doses of COVID-19 vaccine and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.  
  
‚ÄúParticularly for those who have received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine in the country, due to the complicated pandemic situation, it does not mean that there is no risk of getting the virus. Therefore, these people should not be negligent but still need to comply with regulations on pandemic prevention and control, as well as comply with the 5K message,‚Äù T·∫•n said.  
  
In fact, a number of countries with a high rate of COVID-19 vaccine coverage have opened their borders, but after opening, the number of cases increased daily. Therefore, these countries have, again, tightened their pandemic prevention measures and extended social distancing periods.  
  
Regarding the supply of vaccines, Minister Long said that it was expected that by the end of 2021, Vi·ªát Nam would have about 90 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine. In particular, larger amounts of vaccines than originally expected would arrive in September (more than 20 million doses).  
  
In the immediate future, the Ministry of Health requires five localities, including HCM City, H√† N·ªôi, B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng, Long An and ƒê·ªìng Nai to complete the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine for their residents before September 15.  
  
Regarding vaccines for children, the Ministry of Health has actively worked with supply companies and will have a specific injection schedule.  
  
Vi·ªát Nam has administered 22,012,123 doses of vaccines to date, with about 3.3 million people fully vaccinated, according to the health ministry. ‚Äî VNS",,,,1631029834,{},hbxzlft,True,t3_pjpqtr,False,True,t3_pjpqtr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pjpqtr/vietnam_fully_vaccinated_people_still_have_to/hbxzlft/,1631098192.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_10wdsu,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My kids' school district was remote-only from March 2020 until Fall 2020.  Everybody, including the kids in our district, hated it.  That summer, the administration put together a really robust set of COVID protocols and sent them to parents in what can only be described as a ""treatise"" - a 100+ page PDF that included references to studies on best ventilation practices, reasonable desk distances, hallway traffic movement, daily symptom &amp; temperature reporting system (with random in-class checks as well), and, of course, full-time masking.  They really did think this through and it was clear that they had the health of kids as a top priority.

But just as importantly, the *parents* bought in.  In my own informal survey of parents that I knew and talked to, I only heard maybe one or two parents complain about the strict protocols in place, and the overwhelming majority instead expressing gratitude that their kids could go back to school at a time when many districts were still doing remote-only. The sense I got was that having our kids in school was the ultimate goal, and it was a collective responsibility to make that happen.  Also, the degree of work and thoughtfulness that the administration had exhibited created a sense of trust between them and the parents.

From Fall 2020 to winter break 2020, our district did 1/2 day in-school, 1/2 day out of school, with lunch taking place at home.  Starting January 2021, we went to full-time in-school and haven't looked back.

The results?  No outbreaks that were traced back to the school.  IIRC, just about every positive case detected last year was traced back to non-school sources (family attending a wedding, vacation, etc.).  Of course, we can't say with certainty that *no* cases spread at the school.  But overall, I think we can say that the protocols worked.

If the person is vaccinated, they will likely not get a serious case of COVID because their immune system will destroy the virus.  It doesn't happen instantly, though, so they'll get a short term infection.  Because of how COVID works, that means vaccinated people who get temporarily infected can spread the virus for a while, until their body kills it off.

&gt;There's a plan that we need to activate Crisis Standards of Care: **Once a crisis is declared then we activate our plan and our plan involves scoring people in the Emergency Department. So, individual humans would receive a score based on their severity of illness that determines whether or not they qualify for not admission to the Intensive Care Unit, but a trial of admission to the Intensive Care Unit. And that means they're re-scored at 72 hours and if things are going in the wrong direction for them and someone with a better score needs the bed we would de-allocate the resource.**

[],,a_Left_Coaster,,,,,,[],"&gt;‚ÄúI cannot believe there is such a debate over this,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt is mind-blowing to me that people would question it.‚Äù

&gt;In some parts of the country, debates over whether to require face coverings in schools have stirred turbulent school board meetings, lawsuits, fistfights and knockdown, drag-out conflicts between Republican governors banning mask mandates and local leaders who want them. With these events making headlines, it can be easy to forget that in most places, school leaders decided to require masks ‚Äî or make them optional ‚Äî without much fuss. Communities, like Alexandria and Clarion, were generally supportive of the decisions made by their school leaders.

&gt;There is overwhelming scientific evidence that masks slow the spread of the coronavirus, which is why the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics have recommended that people over the age of 2 ‚Äî save those with medical exemptions ‚Äî wear them inside school buildings.

&gt;The calls for masking have grown more urgent as a highly contagious variant of the coronavirus circulates. Late last month, the CDC released a paper detailing an outbreak earlier this year at a Marin County, Calif., elementary school, where an unvaccinated teacher who took off her mask to read aloud in the class infected half her students. And as schools have reopened for the 2021-22 school year, tens of thousands of students in states across the country have tested positive for the virus or have had to be quarantined, portending another school term marked by significant disruptions.

&gt;Clarion County‚Äôs coronavirus statistics are worse per capita than Alexandria‚Äôs by nearly every measure. The county has a higher rate of overall cases, and its per capita death rate is nearly three times that of Alexandria‚Äôs. In the past week, Clarion County averaged about nine new cases a day, which comes out to about 23 cases per 100,000 people. Alexandria was averaging about 15 new cases per 100,000 people a day over the past week.

&gt;But the pandemic is still perceived by many in Clarion to be a mostly urban problem. Carrico said community members were resistant to restrictions because many had not been directly affected by the virus. Even those who have direct experience with it ‚Äî having contracted it themselves, or seen friends and family fall seriously ill from it ‚Äî remained steadfast in their beliefs that the threat was being overblown by public health authorities.

&gt;So when school started late last month, many people were not wearing masks: not the superintendent, who was confident being vaccinated would protect him; not the social studies teacher, who previously contracted the disease; not the sixth-grade teacher, who decided to forgo a coronavirus vaccine because she said her doctor told her it would cause fertility issues, which the CDC and other medical experts say is not the case; and not many of the students.

&gt;Todd MacBeth, a former teacher and principal who serves on the school board, said he gets information about the virus from individual doctors who have contradicted the CDC, people like Scott Atlas, the controversial Trump adviser who pushed the discredited idea that the virus should be allowed to run rampant to achieve ‚Äúherd immunity.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúPeople in general ‚Äî and students specifically ‚Äî are not meant to breathe their own exhaust,‚Äù said MacBeth, repeating the debunked myth that wearing masks is harmful because it causes the wearer to inhale carbon dioxide and leads to oxygen deprivation. (Doctors and scientists say that‚Äôs not true and that there‚Äôs no evidence masks harm those who use them.) He added that he was concerned for the mental health of students after hearing from young people who said they ‚Äúdreaded‚Äù attending classes in masks. ‚ÄúYou know, kids need to breathe in free, fresh air,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd the idea of masks is just abhorrent to me.‚Äù

&gt;Even though they may be growing up in communities on opposite sides of the mask divide, many young people in Clarion and Alexandria shared similar sentiments about them. In some ways, wearing masks felt like unwanted homework: an obligation that students found annoying but necessary. Last year in Clarion, when Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) mandated masks, even reluctant parents complied so their children could return to classrooms.

&gt;Over the summer, Wolf said he would allow school districts to come up with their own mask rules. But on Aug. 31, with coronavirus case numbers on the rise in the Keystone State, he changed course and said he would mandate them for all schools and day cares. That left Clarion no choice but to ditch its mask-optional plan and institute a mandate when students return after Labor Day.

&gt;Eliza Datko, 12, a seventh-grader at Clarion Area Junior/Senior High, was dubious that masks could prevent the spread of the coronavirus and did not believe she would get all that sick if she caught the virus. Eliza is old enough for a coronavirus vaccination, but her mother, Christie Datko, said she is opposed to it, believing that her son‚Äôs autism may be tied to a childhood vaccination. Multiple studies, including by the National Academy of Medicine and the CDC, have shown that vaccinations do not cause autism.

&gt;Eliza, a cross-country runner who won a school citizenship award last year, said she was not happy after learning of Wolf‚Äôs new mask mandate. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôll do what people want me to do,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get in trouble.‚Äù

&gt;Ashton Rex, a 16-year-old junior at Clarion Area Junior/Senior High and a member of the football team, said he was angry that the governor reinstated the mask mandate because he doesn‚Äôt believe masks work. He also said he didn‚Äôt fear contracting the virus ‚Äî even though coronavirus outbreaks had forced two opponents to cancel games in recent weeks. But he said he will mask up if he‚Äôs threatened with suspension from the football team.

&gt;‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs needed at all. I think it‚Äôs pretty dumb,‚Äù Rex said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think covid‚Äôs that serious, anyways. I don‚Äôt see it as anything more than a cold.‚Äù

&gt;Alyssa Morrison, a mother of a kindergartner, begrudgingly put a mask on her son during the last school year so he could attend prekindergarten. But this year‚Äôs mask mandate was a step too far for her, despite the CDC recommendation.

&gt;‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust the government, and I don‚Äôt trust the CDC,‚Äù said the 31-year-old hairdresser, who describes herself as a ‚Äúnaturalist‚Äù and opposes childhood vaccines. Hours after Wolf made his announcement, Morrison was communicating with other parents about how to resist the mandate, even if it meant home schooling their children.

&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôll fight it,‚Äù she said.

&gt;She wasn‚Äôt the only one. On Friday, two Republican state lawmakers, two private Christian schools and a trio of parents filed a lawsuit in Commonwealth Court seeking to overturn the mask mandate, according to the Associated Press.

&gt;In Alexandria, by contrast, almost all students have complied willingly with the mask mandate, although a small number of parents sought ‚Äî and were granted ‚Äî medical exemptions for their children. That includes Liz Fuller, who said that masks make her 7-year-old son, John, who suffers from anxiety and panic attacks, even more anxious and dizzy at school.

&gt;Rebecca Grutza, a 7-year-old in Alexandria, and her two sisters said they find the masks uncomfortable and struggle to keep them on all day. That said, Rebecca said she wants to keep everyone safe.

&gt;‚ÄúAnd if we don‚Äôt wear a mask,‚Äù she added, ‚Äúthen we can‚Äôt be in school.‚Äù

&gt;Last school year, when Pennsylvania mandated masks, Carrico instituted an elaborate set of safeguards to prevent people from getting infected at school, and he kept the doors open every day. The district has just two schools, neither of which is overcrowded, so it was not hard to keep students socially distanced in classrooms. The mandate was diligently enforced; even the student performers in the musical, ‚ÄúNewsies,‚Äù wore masks onstage. So did musicians in the band, with those on wind instruments wearing face coverings with small slits to allow them to play. The tuba player was forced to play facing backward.

&gt;But this year, when Carrico put together a school safety plan for the school board to approve, he decided to forgo a mask mandate because it seemed like the pandemic was abating. The CDC, which recommended in late July that everyone over age 2 wear masks in school buildings, did not change his mind. Carrico mistakenly thought the CDC was not a government agency and believed its advice was tailored only to hot spots, like those in Florida and Texas.

&gt;""We have to look at everything through a local lens,‚Äù he said late last month, adding that he would reconsider his stance if there was a severe outbreak at the school.

&gt;Clarion borough is about a five-hour drive northwest of the city of Alexandria, but the political and cultural chasm that separates them can make it feel a galaxy apart.

&gt;About 60 percent of the Clarion borough‚Äôs residents cast ballots for President Donald Trump in November. In Alexandria, election results were even more lopsided: About 80 percent of those who went to the polls voted for Joe Biden. Alexandria, across the river from the nation‚Äôs capital, is more affluent, better-educated and more diverse, with more than a third of its residents identifying as Black or Latino. In the Clarion Area School District, which serves a rural area 75 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, more than nine of 10 residents are White, with small numbers of Black, Latino and Asian residents.

&gt;A survey of parents conducted by Rand Corp. in July found that two-thirds or more of Black, Hispanic and Asian parents said they needed school mask mandates for them to feel as if their child was safe at school. Less than a third of White parents wanted the same. Parents in urban and suburban regions were also more likely to want mask mandates than those in rural regions, according to the survey. And poll after poll has shown that Republicans are less concerned about the coronavirus than Democrats.

&gt;All of these differences can be seen on the ground in both communities and help explain why Alexandria has taken a much more cautious approach than Clarion County, which has a higher coronavirus death rate and case rate than Alexandria. Both have case rates greater than 8,000 per 100,000 people, meaning there have been more than eight infections for every hundred people since the start of the pandemic.

&gt;Some families of color remain wary of returning to classrooms as new school year begins

&gt;For Alexandria school leaders, those statistics were part of the reason a mask mandate was all but a foregone conclusion. Pointing in part to the demographics of his city, and noting that communities of color have been hit especially hard by the pandemic, Hutchings, who is Black, said he has received very little resistance to his mask mandate.

&gt;At Alexandria‚Äôs Samuel W. Tucker Elementary, Principal Rene Paschal started planning to reopen with required masking even before the school board unanimously voted to mandate it in early August and before Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) ordered a K-12 indoor mask mandate on Aug. 12. When Paschal convened his school reopening team on July 20, everyone around the table that day assumed masks would be part of the equation.

&gt;‚ÄúI did make an assumption that masking was inevitable,‚Äù Paschal said. ‚ÄúIn fact, with the delta variant spiking, it seemed, to me, obvious.‚Äù

&gt;Leslie Weinstein, mother to an Alexandria kindergartner, was shocked when she learned from a reporter that the school board had bothered to vote on the issue.

&gt;CLARION, Pa. ‚Äî When the school board that oversees this town‚Äôs tiny district of about 730 students voted on a safety plan over the summer, there was no discussion of masks. School administrators had drawn up a plan that did not require them, and one board member who believed they should be mandated did not even raise the question. He was certain it was a nonstarter.

&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to pick and choose my battles sometimes,‚Äù said Braxton White, one of two Democrats on the nine-member board.

&gt;In Alexandria, Va., the decision to mandate masks was just as uncontroversial. Superintendent Gregory Hutchings Jr. said he encountered no resistance when the word went out that children and staff would have to wear them in school buildings.

&gt;‚ÄúI really do believe that this is just becoming the way things are,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is like our new normal ‚Äî you know, it‚Äôs more awkward with somebody who doesn‚Äôt wear a mask.‚Äù

&gt;For many people in Clarion, the mask symbolizes a capitulation to what they believe to be hysteria over a pandemic whose dangers they say are hyped up by the government and the media. In Alexandria, the masks represent an effective and evidence-based safety measure. Far from fighting mask mandates, some parents are nervous that they won‚Äôt be enforced stringently enough. They want more social distancing, especially during lunch, and they have called for a quick implementation of routine coronavirus testing.

&gt;So how did these two communities, facing the same deadly threat, come to such different conclusions about what should be done about the pandemic? The answer is relatively simple. Parents and school leaders in both places firmly believe in their respective approaches. Neither thinks the path they are pursuing is particularly controversial. As the schools in both districts opened over the past two weeks, there were no protests, no fighting and, so far, no significant problems.

&gt;In Alexandria, the school district is following the advice of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and scientists, all of whom endorse masks and vaccines. In Clarion, there is suspicion of those same authorities, fueled by misinformation and by some politicians and personalities who have dismissed or downplayed the coronavirus‚Äôs impact. There is also frustration with restrictions that gutted local businesses and a sense that the pandemic is more of a problem for urban and suburban settings than for their rural community.

&gt;In Clarion, with a masks-optional policy in place at the beginning of the school year, Superintendent Joe Carrico said few students or teachers came to school wearing them.",,,,1631036086,{},hbyetoh,True,t3_pjrsrf,False,False,t3_pjrsrf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pjrsrf/two_school_districts_and_two_radically_different/hbyetoh/,1631106131.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_q345z9d,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, this article cites research that states that vaccinated persons have about 1/5th a chance of infection as unvaccinated persons (and that's also analogous with my own county's data), so it would not be hard to estimate the total number of breakthrough infections based on the number of cases and vaccination rate in a population.

In fact, with those numbers we could estimate that the total number of breakthrough cases is equal to the following:

(Vaccination Rate \* Total Cases) / (5 - 4 \* Vaccination Rate)

For example, a population that had 6,000 cases and a 50% vaccination rate would have 1,000 breakthrough infections and 5,000 unvaccinated infections. A population that has 2,250 cases and a 80% vaccination rate also has 1,000 breakthrough infections. Or a population with 21,0000 cases and a 20% vaccination rate also has 1,000 breakthrough infections.

One of the reasons H1N1 was so horrible believed (not by a experts, though) that the external parts of the virus came from a bird flu, but the internal parts that made it super infectious came from a normal human flu at the time. A pig caught both, and suddenly you had the genes that allowed to virus to replicate in humans, but with an outer surface from the avian flu that human immune systems had never seen before, allowing unchecked spread.

With COVID, the reason so much emphasis is placed on antibodies for the spike protein, is that the spike protein is believed to be required for the virus to enter a human cell and infect it. If the virus mutates to have a very different spike protein that antibodies no longer recognize, it will likely also not be able to easily infect a human cell.

I mean, this is what you need to make remote learning work:

1) A parent or caretaker that is able to assist with online learning.  If both parents work you're screwed.  If one is WFH they'll have to make huge concessions for work.  If you need to have a nanny you're paying a good deal of money for care and schooling help.

2) A child that can handle remote learning.  It takes the right kid to be able to do the asynchronous, 'go through some webpages' learning that a lot of the virtual schools are.  It takes the right kid to do the 3-6hrs of zoom a day that a lot of the hybrid models were.  Many kids failed at both.  A lot of places are offering neither this year, and if you have to home school it's addiitonal cost to supply whatever solution works for your kid.

We'd love to keep our kids safe.  We'd also love to make sure our kids aren't getting depressed.  We'd also love to make sure that our kids aren't being left behind academically.  In person learning probably was the best way to ensure most of that happened.  Delta happened, and many districts were unable to change course that quickly.  Federally there seems to be not a huge push to change things because of course -- no one gives a rat's ass about long term complications or people with disabilities.

The theory:
&gt; the vaccinated, getting sick, not showing symptoms and then getting the unvaxxed sick

How things worked before vaccines were available:
&gt; the unvaccinated, getting sick, not showing symptoms and then getting the unvaxxed sick

Plus we have ample evidence that the vaccines dramatically reduce  infection and spread.  Some elderly people can get sick enough to spread it a little, that doesn't mean they're spreading it more than if they weren't vaccinated.  There is absolutely 0 legs to that theory.

The quarantine thing was an issue because our dogs were vaccinated on my dad‚Äôs farm, which is in a different state than I live in and has different requirements. So it was a few nasty phone calls and some paperwork and vet visits, it was just added stress.  

The skunk itself:  I woke up to a family member screaming something about a skunk.  In the past I‚Äôve lived in houses with nearby skunk families, and usually they just want some cat food and if they see you they run away.  So I wasn‚Äôt bothered, I shoo‚Äôed it away and picked up the dog food bowls to remove temptation.  And then I went outside about fifteen minutes later, and the damned fucking thing had come back and was hiding in pounce position between the tires of our car. It saw me, ran at me and bit my foot twice, then back off and ran back and bit my foot twice more.  I think my screaming scared it away, I got dressed and told a family member we needed to go to the ER*now*.  I remember clutching a broom in the car, that I had carried to hit it with in case it ran at me again. We called animal control and emailed our neighborhood on the way to the hospital.  

The animal control officer said he went around to the neighbors, looking for skunk sightings.  But when he doubled back to my house, he found the damned thing outside **my** door, trying to get in and bite me *again*.  That fucker wanted me, not my other family members or my neighbors or my dogs‚Ä¶ it wanted to kill **me**. I felt like I was in a horror movie with a villain whose been killed already but just will not die.  

At least, even when it was still scary feeling I still knew it was an incredibly funny story.

They should have moved at the first confirmation we were following Israel's path. Not wait until it starts to become a disaster.

July vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization was down to 80% for seniors in the study giving the highest numbers. Waiting months after that came out is unjustified.

Biden was right to hold their feet to the fire, and to bring up 5-6 months. 8 for seniors is absurd.

I see several problems. 

1. From a strategic point of view, keeping people in rich countries from getting the sniffles while poor countries wait for the life saving first doses isn‚Äôt just morally reprehensible, it‚Äôs increasing the odds of more variants popping up in poor countries. And even though we don‚Äôt *think* it‚Äôs possible for a new variant to completely evade immunity, that seems like asking for trouble. 

2. The more doses we ask people to take, the more the genuinely hesitant turn away. It‚Äôs one thing to do it once, entirely another to do it every six months. Which is part of why flu shot compliance is kinda dismal. People think, rationally or not, that if you have to keep doing it, it doesn‚Äôt work. 

3. People getting third doses are reporting unpleasant side effects similar to the initial series. Yes, that‚Äôs not a dangerous situation, but it‚Äôs going to damage compliance again. Do you want a fourth round of feeling like you were hit by a garbage truck to avoid minor illness? And to be clear, after three doses, we are talking minor illness.

[],,TheSaxonPlan,,,,,,,"It's true that I can't say 100% that's its the dose. There are many factors, as discussed below. 

Both vaccines are mRNA. There are saRNA vaccines in trials though. 

Both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines encode a modified version of the spike gene which locks the produced spike protein into an activated (post-cleavage) position. This allows the body to focus antibody production on the more dangerous form of the protein and thus ock infection more readily. Both encode the same protein sequence but other aspects are different.

I have to admit I don't know anything off the top of my head about the UTRs of these particular mRNA vaccines. So I went and read up a bit.

[This review ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8310186/) is really good at breaking down the vaccines and how they are similar/different, although it is technically very heavy and is mostly focused on how to potentially improve the vaccines. 

From the article, how they are the same:
mRNA coding sequence:
&gt; Both mRNA encodes the same S-2P protein [5,6] which differ from the spike protein in the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome (NC_045512) by two amino acids, i.e., amino acids KV at sites 986 and 987 were replaced by PP to stabilize the resulting spike protein in the prefusion state to train the host immune system to recognize the virus before its entry into the host cell [7,8].

&amp;nbsp;


From the article, some differences are:
1) Codon optimization (what codons are used to encode certain amino acids)
&gt;These two strategies are exemplified by the codon optimization involving GAR codons encoding Glu (Table 3). The SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512) has 34 GAA codons and 14 GAG codons in its spike protein gene. Moderna‚Äôs mRNA-1273 has taken the fundamentalist strategy and replaced all GAA codons by GAG. In contrast, Pfizer/BioNTech‚Äôs BNT-162b2 took the liberal strategy, and left 14 GAA codons unchanged (Table 3). Moderna has consistently applied the fundamentalist strategy for all codon families in mRNA-1273, whereas Pfizer/BioNTech has consistently used the liberal strategy in codon optimization for BNT-162b2. There is no systematic evaluation of these two codon optimization strategies in translation efficiency.

&amp;nbsp;
A possible (but in no way scientifically examined via experiment) explanation for dose differences:
2) Sequence and secondary structure of 5' (upstream) untranslated region (UTR)
&gt;
It is not known if such a secondary structure in the 5‚Ä≤-UTR of mRNA-1273 (Figure 2C) would hamper the cap-dependent scanning for the start codon and result in less efficient translation. However, the 5‚Ä≤-UTR of BNT162b2 derived from 5‚Ä≤-UTR of the human Œ±-globin gene (Figure 2) does appear to be superior over mRNA-1273 in this aspect. As I mentioned before, mRNA-1273 also has a problem in codon optimization (e.g., excessive use of CGG that is not an optimal codon). These factors might jointly impact negatively the translation efficiency of mRNA-1273 and contribute to the requirement of a high dosage of Moderna vaccine (100 Œºg/dose) relative to that of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (30 Œºg/dose). When an mRNA is not translated efficiently, more of it is needed to produce the same amount of the encoded spike protein. [...]
The 5‚Ä≤-UTR of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine mRNA incorporates the 5‚Ä≤-UTR of a human Œ±-globin gene (Figure 2A), which makes sense because Œ±-globin mRNAs are translated very efficiently.¬†

&amp;nbsp;
3) Stop codon: what stop sequence is used to tell the ribosome to stop using the mRNA to make a protein.
&gt;In fact, multiple lines of evidence suggest much difference in termination efficiency and accuracy among the three stop codons. Pfizer/BioNTech‚Äôs BNT162b2 mRNA features two consecutive UGA stop codons. Moderna‚Äôs mRNA-1273 uses all three different stop codons UGAUAAUAG. Are these the optimal arrangement? [...]
One caveat in the reasoning above involves the replacement of U by N1-methylpseudouridine (Œ®) in the two vaccine mRNAs. To alleviate host cells to attack exogeneous vaccine mRNA as foreign RNA [13,58], all uridines in the mRNA vaccines were replaced by Œ® [2,14]. Therefore, the stop signals are Œ®GAŒ®GA instead of UGAUGA in Pfizer/BioNTech‚Äôs vaccine, and Œ®GAŒ®AAŒ®AG instead of UGAUAAUAG in Moderna‚Äôs vaccine.

&amp;nbsp;
4) 3' (downstream) UTR sequence:
&gt;Moderna‚Äôs mRNA-1273 ‚Äúpasted‚Äù the 110-nt 3‚Ä≤-UTR of human Œ±-globin gene (HBA1) between the last stop codon and a poly(A) tail.The design of the 3‚Ä≤-UTR of the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine is a combination of SELEX and borrowing from nature.


It's really hard to tell what, if any of these, is responsible for differences in addition to or despite the dose.

That means that deaths never reached particularly high levels (most high-risk had been fully vaccinated), but cases could still increase to very high levels. It was also around this time that Delta took over. Although we knew it was coming, everybody still had to adjust to a more infectious variant where you don't get much protection from only having first vaccine shot (rather than being fully vaccinated).

As of today, both 12-20 years and 20-30 years are around 70% fully vaccinated in Denmark, older age groups are much higher, and the overall for the entire population is above 70%. This should, hopefully, provide a level of protection and in the last couple of weeks the infection-levels have been slowly falling.

Can't even massage/make up ""data"" about how WFH ""hurt"" their company--instead relying on more buzzwords than the ""liberal arts majors"" they like to decry as not being ""quantitative"" enough.

There's a big difference between ""you'll eventually be exposed to the virus"" and ""you'll eventually get covid-19"". Even for vaccinated people, a lot depends on the initial viral load.

In the midst of a surge, you a much more likely to be exposed to a high viral load, because there are many, many more people with covid-19 walking around than there were in May or June.

So even if we accept that covid will be endemic, there is still a strong argument for taking extra precautions in the midst of a surge (like the one happening in the US currently) and then relaxing precautions when the surge is over. 

Even if covid becomes endemic, it is likely that surges will become less severe over time as more and more of the population has some level of immunity, whether from vaccines or from previous exposure (or both).

A source for your claim that coronaviruses ""resequence their code"". Also a source for your claim that better treatment methods means less long covid. 

&gt; Even if it restricts how much it can mutate, it can still mutate

Yes...the ability to mutate has never been in question is a real ""duh"" statement. Coronaviruses still mutate far less than many other common viruses. 

&gt; But 70-80% was supposed to be enough they said. Now it isn't anymore? Allow me to have serious doubts about this

It's almost like Delta is far more contagious than the OG strain, and with that drastically increased contagiousness comes an increased bar for herd immunity. Surely even you can grasp this much, yes? 

&gt;And giving me a document that explains to me how I should interpret numbers, with thing written in bold and with colors well... That's not going to cut it

Covid and flu are respiratory diseases, they can start replicating in your respiratory tract, which is obviously the first place most viruses in the air can find. Measles does it‚Äôs replicating in other tissues, so by the time it can really get started, your memory cells are already on it. 

There‚Äôs also mutation rate. Flu is the champ at that. Flu mutates so fast that it‚Äôs basically a whole new set of viruses every year. And the kind of mutations it can make are so drastic that your immune system just doesn‚Äôt recognize the next flu. Measles barely mutates at all. Covid is in the middle. It can mutate some, but slowly, and if it gets too far away from what your immune system recognizes, it will stop working at all, because the spike protein is also what it uses to get into cells. So chances are good our current vaccines will work on every possible mutation, but it might be just different enough to slow down the recognition, but still close enough that it will. 

One of the cool things about Covid vaccines is that they predicted several possible mutations and put those antigens on the synthetic spike, so it‚Äôs much wider coverage than you‚Äôd get from just one variant.

In hindsight, if all countries had followed the policies of ASEAN countries, which managed to get cases down to 0, then the opportunity was there.  Unfortunately, that was never going to happen in the West.  Governments could not enact the strict measures in Asia, their populations refused to comply with even light lockdowns.

Further, other poorer countries simply do not have the control and capability to enforce such lockdowns.  Think of Brazil, Colombia, most of Africa, etc.  So, while the contact tracing + lockdown method worked for countries like Australia, NZ, Taiwan, Korea, etc., it was never viable on a global scale.

These countries enjoyed a very pleasant 1year+ while the ancestral strain &amp; the first variants spread voraciously across North/South America, Europe and the Middle East.  However, the contact tracing + lockdown method is failing against Delta.  Delta spreads too quickly and easily to be contained.

Many of the countries which had controlled and even effectively eliminated the original strains are now facing outbreaks.  Most are realizing that a new strategy is in order.  The extreme cost (mentally, financially, and otherwise) of the containment strategy no longer justifies the potential benefit.  

Previously, there was a goal and a target of 0 cases.  This is no longer achievable.  As such, what is the point of a lockdown?  It seems to only delay the inevitable.  The only possible goal now is to lockdown until a target vaccination level is reached.  Then you start to reopen, knowing cases will increase.  Australia is targeting a similar goal in their lockdowns.

My point is that lockdowns and contact tracing are completely ineffective against Delta.  You cannot expect a population to lock down for months or years indefinitely.  The reality is that for vaccinated individuals, Delta is simply not ""risky"" enough to justify further lockdowns.  

It's also important to realize that strategies which are implemented locally will eventually fail if they are not implemented globally.  Borders cannot remain closed forever, and global trade cannot take pause for long periods of time without major financial implications.",,,,1631038325,{},hbyk84q,False,t3_pjap6n,False,False,t1_hbxiksx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pjap6n/new_mu_covid_variant_now_found_in_49_us_states/hbyk84q/,1631109166.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_30d5b0y2,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It does seem to be more common in young men in both cases, so maybe?

I've personally wondered if the people who develop myocarditis were doing intense workouts/sports/whatever. The group who develop it seem to be the group most likely to be participating in sports. If it were that simple, I imagine someone would have already figured it out, though.

I'm not saying that avoiding boosters or even 2nd shots altogether isn't the best* at preventing spread overall and even at minimizing negatives as a whole. 

However, realistically it's a situation where group A that has ready access to vaccines and boosters that would protect better against even low level infections, probably, from group B who won't get vaxxed have to commit to a sacrifice their own potential health in the future for the sake of group C who doesn't have ready access to vaccines. 

You're going to be hard pressed to find any group that will willingly force that plan. 

My opinion is that it isn't immoral or unethical to pursue a booster program. I do think however those who are willingly unvaccinated and are placing this unprecedented strain that is leading to the desire for the booster shot in the first place need to pay a MUCH higher price than they currently are. Especially in regards to cost of care, societal support, and if care needs to be rationed they should be the first to be cut off.

I don't think it will ever go away (zero Covid) but after spring 2022 I don't think there will be hospitals getting overrun which is the big issue right now, along with protecting those that can't protect themselves (kids/imunocomprised). 

If it weren't for what is going on in the south and unvaccinated states, I think most things would be pretty normal right now, even now at a huge improvement over anything last year and if you look at sporting events things are just about normal.

Spring 2022 should be pretty much back to normal. Even a new variant I think boosters should be able to take care of things.

I do think rest of the world things could be different for a while longer.

Wish more people understood this type of expectation, I always see some who are too worried and many who make it seem like this will never end. 

I guess I understand the ""just two more weeks"" mantra that has been echoed the entire pandemic. But I completely agree with being cautious where if you feel like you are overreacting, you are probably doing the right thing. What is going on in some states seems like it can still cause issues in other states, just feel like some more time is needed.

For me come spring 2022 if kids can be vaccinated, boosters are available, the vaccines continue to be effective against hospitalization. And natural immunity is having an effect.

What also gets lost is that the illness for breakthrough cases is almost always mild, but not true of the unvaccinated cases. So ""case"" has a very different meaning.

The percentage of cases that are vaccinated, and the percentage of cases of the vaccinated population, are totally different things.

Mu mutations of interest, from an epidemiologist's blog that gets eaten by spam-filter, RIP:

D614G: This mutation is very common. It started to appear in Feb 2020 and is now on every variant thereafter. This mutation increases transmissibility of the virus.

P681H: This is a mutation that is found on the Alpha variant (first discovered in the UK), which increases transmissibility.

T95I: This is where our monoclonal antibodies and antiviral treatments attach, so this change could mean escape from medical interventions and immunity. We see this mutation on Iota, too.

E484K and N501Y: These two mutations are on the receptor binding domain, which is the virus‚Äô key to our cells (ACE2 receptors; read more on my previous post here). E484K is resistant to monoclonal antibodies and immunity. N501Y is responsible for increased transmission. Both are present on other variants including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Eta, and Iota.

Q160R: This mutation suppresses the immune response allowing the virus additional opportunity to replicate.

S67F: This change is unique to Mu. Scientists are worried about this change because it‚Äôs on a location that inhibits B- and T-cell recognition (i.e. immune response). Researchers are quickly studying this change.

This is not at all how mutations work. The vast majority of mutations have no impact on the virus. A small number of mutations have the capability to make the virus more contagious or more infectious (as we saw with delta). But statistically, the longer that a virus is in human population, it usually trends to become *less* infections than more infections. Because those same mutations can also make a disease less contagious or less infectious.

Add to that the fact that covid was once a novel virus, which few people's immune systems had any antibodies for. Now, the majority of the population (in the US) has been vaccinated or contracted it, so they have a more informed immune response. A mutation isn't likely to escape that immune response. A severe mutation may mean your body is less effective at fighting the virus, but it is still MORE effective at fighting it than it was when the virus was novel and it had no clue. Because a mutation doesn't mean it's an entirely new virus, just a slightly evolved version of the old virus.

So no, the pandemic isn't just going to ""start all over"". That's not remotely how this will work.",,,,1631047836,{},hbz7d6q,False,t3_pjsm97,False,False,t1_hbz5svv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pjsm97/who_says_covid_will_mutate_like_the_flu_and_is/hbz7d6q/,1631123205.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_8yzz5l8f,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This [paper](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/143380?ref=theprepping-com) shows that previous infection even with other coronaviruses is associated with less severe COVID19 symptoms. This suggests that as more variants of SARS-CoV2 emerge that they may not be as virulent in previously infected patients. It's important to note that there is the possibility of [antibody-dependent enhancement with SARS-CoV2](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-clinical-and-translational-science/article/potential-for-antibodydependent-enhancement-of-sarscov2-infection-translational-implications-for-vaccine-development/504FE38E2475590EFE93872BC6D67D3D).

Viral recombination is well known, that‚Äôs why I was asking for a source for resequencing itself, because something resequencing itself would imply a complete re-write and that really threw me off, thanks for providing that source and clarifying what you meant. 

And on that note from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2546970/

&gt;	We agree that recombination may sometimes occur between a vaccine virus and its circulating wild-type counterpart. There is suggestive evidence that this has occurred between the NDV vaccine virus and a circulating NDV strain (8), although we know of no similar evidence for mumps or measles virus. Recombination yields a virus with a mosaic genome containing sections from the parents. This virus likely would exhibit a virulence phenotype resembling one parent or the other or something in between. It thus does not create a hazard exceeding that of the circulating wild-type virus already present. 

This would suggest that even if it did happen it‚Äôs far more likely to create a dud than some sort of super virus. 

&gt;	That is pretty much exactly what I said in the beginning and what the article I shared explained.

You literally just said (paraphrasing because I‚Äôm on mobile): ‚Äúwe were originally told 70-80% and now that‚Äôs not enough? Allow me to doubt‚Äù

That implies you think scientists are just arbitrarily moving the goalposts, but they aren‚Äôt. If it was still OG covid 70-80% would be enough. Delta is going to take 90%+, similarly to the measles. 

You are correct that vaccine-only herd immunity is highly unlikely at this point, but that isn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs not possible, it‚Äôs because too many people won‚Äôt get on board with it. 

&gt;	You‚Äôre operating out of a place of bad faith, you are condescending and you don‚Äôt have any arguments against what I‚Äôm saying except high school grade sophistics.

I‚Äôm not operating on bad faith my guy, you didn‚Äôt really say anything to respond to directly. You made wild claims about the vaccines being dangerous because it might recombine with sars-cov-2 to form an even worse strain. That is not only suuuuuuuuuuper unlikely to happen, I‚Äôm not even sure it‚Äôs a risk with the mRNA vaccines in the first place, and was not able to find any literature on that. 

You also made claims about scientists advocating against vaccination because it might cause additional variants, which is so widely out in left field, the burden of proof is squarely on you (and those scientists) to show that it is wrong. This is doubly true because so far all the variants have been originating from unvaccinated populations. 

&gt;	I think you might want to apply the dunning kruger effect to yourself.

No, I know how out of my depth with this stuff I am. I know enough to read and (mostly) understand the scientific literature, which is exactly why I stick to what is in the literature and try to do as little of my own conjecture as possible.

[],,TheSaxonPlan,,,,,,,"Currently, it appears that Moderna is the best shot to have. This is likely due to the higher dose and extra week between the shots. The Pfizer shot delivers 30 micrograms of mRNA whereas the Moderna vaccine delivers 100 micrograms of mRNA. 

[Here is a preprint article ](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.06.21261707v1) from the Mayo Clinic examining Moderna and Pfizer against the Alpha and Delta variants. The abstract gives you most of the necessary info but the most important parts (IMO) are:

&gt;Both vaccines were highly effective during this study period against SARS-CoV-2 infection (mRNA-1273 (Moderna): 86%; BNT162b2 (Pfizer): 76%) and COVID-19 associated hospitalization (mRNA-1273: 91.6%; BNT162b2: 85%).

&gt;**However, in July, the effectiveness against infection was considerably lower for mRNA-1273 (76%) with an even more pronounced reduction in effectiveness for BNT162b2 (42%).**

&gt;Notably, the Delta variant prevalence in Minnesota increased from 0.7% in May to over 70% in July whereas the Alpha variant prevalence decreased from 85% to 13% over the same time period.

&gt;mRNA-1273 conferred a two-fold risk reduction against breakthrough infection compared to BNT162b2 (IRR = 0.50). In Florida, which is currently experiencing its largest COVID-19 surge to date, **the risk of infection in July after full vaccination with mRNA-1273 was about 60% lower than after full vaccination with BNT162b2** (IRR: 0.39).

I became eligible for a third shot due to being immunocompromised. My first two were Pfizer but I asked for (and had to get special approval) for Moderna as my third due to this data.

&gt; The C.D.C. reported a terrifying fact in July: Vaccinated people with the Delta variant of the Covid virus carried roughly the same viral load in their noses and throats as unvaccinated people.
The news seemed to suggest that even the vaccinated were highly vulnerable to getting infected and passing the virus to others. Sure enough, stories about vaccinated people getting Covid ‚Äî so-called breakthrough infections ‚Äî were all around this summer: at a party in Provincetown, Mass.; among the Chicago Cubs; on Capitol Hill. Delta seemed as if it might be changing everything.


&gt;In recent weeks, however, more data has become available, and it suggests that the true picture is less alarming. Yes, Delta has increased the chances of getting Covid for almost everyone. But if you‚Äôre vaccinated, a Covid infection is still uncommon, and those high viral loads are not as worrisome as they initially sounded.
How small are the chances of the average vaccinated American contracting Covid? Probably about one in 5,000 per day, and even lower for people who take precautions or live in a highly vaccinated community.
#Or maybe one in 10,000
The estimates here are based on statistics from three places that have reported detailed data on Covid infections by vaccination status: Utah; Virginia; and King County, which includes Seattle, in Washington state. All three are consistent with the idea that about one in 5,000 vaccinated Americans have tested positive for Covid each day in recent weeks.


&gt;The chances are surely higher in the places with the worst Covid outbreaks, like the Southeast. And in places with many fewer cases ‚Äî like the Northeast, as well as the Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco areas ‚Äî the chances are lower, probably less than 1 in 10,000. That‚Äôs what the Seattle data shows, for example. (These numbers don‚Äôt include undiagnosed cases, which are often so mild that people do not notice them and do not pass the virus to anyone else.)
&gt; Here‚Äôs one way to think about a one-in-10,000 daily chance: It would take more than three months for the combined risk to reach just 1 percent.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a lot of miscommunication about what the risks really are to vaccinated people, and how vaccinated people should be thinking about their lives,‚Äù as Dr. Ashish Jha of Brown University told my colleague Tara Parker-Pope. (I recommend Tara‚Äôs recent Q. and A. on breakthrough infections.)


&gt;For the unvaccinated, of course, the chances of infection are far higher, as Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, the top public-health official in Seattle, has noted. Those chances have also risen much more since Delta began spreading:

&gt; Another way to understand the situation is to compare each state‚Äôs vaccination rate with its recent daily Covid infection rate. The infection rates in the least vaccinated states are about four times as high as in the most vaccinated states:

&gt; If the entire country had received shots at the same rate as the Northeast or California, the current Delta wave would be a small fraction of its current size. Delta is a problem. Vaccine hesitancy is a bigger problem.
#The science, in brief


&gt;These numbers help show why the talking point about viral loads was problematic. It was one of those statements that managed to be both true and misleading. Even when the size of the viral loads are similar, the virus behaves differently in the noses and throats of the vaccinated and the unvaccinated.


&gt;In an unvaccinated person, a viral load is akin to an enemy army facing little resistance. In a vaccinated person, the human immune system launches a powerful response and tends to prevail quickly ‚Äî often before the host body gets sick or infects others. That the viral loads were initially similar in size can end up being irrelevant.


&gt; I will confess to one bit of hesitation about walking you through the data on breakthrough infections: It‚Äôs not clear how much we should be worrying about them. For the vaccinated, Covid resembles the flu and usually a mild one. Society does not ground to a halt over the flu.


&gt;In Britain, many people have become comfortable with the current Covid risks. The vaccines make serious illness rare in adults, and the risks to young children are so low that Britain may never recommend that most receive the vaccine. Letting the virus continue to dominate life, on the other hand, has large costs.


&gt; ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a feeling that finally we can breathe; we can start trying to get back what we‚Äôve lost,‚Äù Devi Sridhar, the head of the global public health program at the University of Edinburgh, told The Times.
&gt; I know that many Americans feel differently. Our level of Covid anxiety is higher, especially in communities that lean to the left politically. And there is no ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù response to Covid. Different people respond to risk differently.
But at least one part of the American anxiety does seem to have become disconnected from the facts in recent weeks: the effectiveness of the vaccines. In a new ABC News/Washington Post poll, nearly half of adults judged their ‚Äúrisk of getting sick from the coronavirus‚Äù as either moderate or high ‚Äî even though 75 percent of adults have received at least one shot.


&gt;In reality, the risks of getting any version of the virus remain small for the vaccinated, and the risks of getting badly sick remain minuscule.


&gt;In Seattle on an average recent day, about one out of every one million vaccinated residents have been admitted to a hospital with Covid symptoms. That risk is so close to zero that the human mind can‚Äôt easily process it. My best attempt is to say that the Covid risks for most vaccinated people are of the same order of magnitude as risks that people unthinkingly accept every day, like riding in a vehicle.

# The bottom line

&gt; Delta really has changed the course of the pandemic. It is far more contagious than earlier versions of the virus and calls for precautions that were not necessary a couple of months ago, like wearing masks in some indoor situations.


&gt; But even with Delta, the overall risks for the vaccinated remain extremely small. As Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, wrote on Friday, ‚ÄúThe messaging over the last month in the U.S. has basically served to terrify the vaccinated and make unvaccinated eligible adults doubt the effectiveness of the vaccines.‚Äù Neither of those views is warranted.

[],,scosag,,,,,,[],"Great post.  I've tried to explain to people why comparing Covid to ebola or some other highly deadly disease isn't accurate for just the reasons you stated.  The really nasty shit out there just kills too efficiently to reach pandemic levels (which in a way is more terrifying), but when you have something that is mutating, pretty easily transmissible AND has strong potential for permanent/chronic negative health outcomes for the infected...bad combo.

At 28 and arguably the healthiest I had been since high school I got Type A flu.  The flu itself was awful and knocked me on my ass for around 5 days.  As in, I got up to use the bathroom and shower and that was it.  The 5 days doesn't include the couple leasing up to it as I felt worse and worse and the couple days after as I recovered.  My doctor had to clear me to go back to work and she warned me to take it easy because I was at risk for a secondary infection like pneumonia.  I honestly brushed it off, went back to work and felt ok the first day.  But when I got home I was practically falling asleep at dinner and went straight to bed...for 11 hours.  Went to work the next day and was winded going up two flights of stairs.  I was physically exhausted the entire day and went straight to bed when I got home and slept for 13 hours.  Next day, same thing.  I went to my boss and told him what was up and said I was going to urgent care right after work as I was worried I'd gotten a secondary infection.  Urgent care cleared me but said Type A flu can really knock the shit out of you and some people take a month to fully recover.  I wound up taking anothet full week off and just laid low, slept a ton.  I didn't feel like myself for almost a month after and it sucked.  I have young kids, at the time I had a big yard that required a lot of maintenance.  Working out in any way was totally off the table.  I just had zero energy.  I cannot imagine getting Covid now in my 30s and having permanent issues that would drastically affect my quality of life.

[],,sleepy_floof,,,,,,[],"It's an impossible choice. We enrolled our 4.5 year old in a small private Pre-K in GA. The school is doing almost everything they can: mask mandates for the older class (3,4, and 5 year olds), all teachers vaccinated and wear masks indoors, windows will be open when weather permits, meals eaten outside whenever weather permits, and one of the parents donated air purifiers for both classrooms.

But, I still panicked about our community rates and pulled her out after the first week. It was early August so still too hot for them to eat outside and/or have windows open. And even with mask mandates, I consistently saw the same three kids walk in every day without their masks on. I mean, they're preschoolers so you can only hope for so much.

So far, the school has had two positive cases: one in the toddler room and one in the older kids' room. They closed for five days and had everyone get tested. As far as I know, no other cases turned up.

I don't worry so much about my daughter having a severe case (the risk is objectively so small). What's holding me back is the unknown - what's going to happen to infected kids in 5 or 10 years? Possibly nothing. Possibly some significant health complications.

But I know she's missing out on really important social and cognitive experiences. The first five years are some of the most important years of your life. There's no recapturing the mental potential these kids have right now later on 

So, as of today, my thoughts are that if our county cases continue to decline this month and we can get to under 50 cases per 100k, I'll send her back in October. By then, the weather will allow them to be outside most of the day and they'll have windows open when they are inside. 

Of course, rain will still exist, so there will be some meals inside. And just because cases are declining doesn't mean she can't catch it.

Now that I've had Covid, and am no longer salty about it, I can logically look at the situation and see it for what it is. I and my family got breakthrough cases, but I think it was probably to be expected at some point.   


I don't think we are ever getting rid of Covid. At this point, it's here to stay BUT the vaccine did it's job. Nobody ever said it would 100% prevent us from getting Covid, but what the vaccine did promise and in our case did was keep all of us out of the hospital. I was really sick and had moderate Covid and my immune compromised teenager was the same. Chances are, we would have, at the very least, needed admission, if not worse, had we not been vaccinated. While on a telehealth visit with my doc yesterday, I cried tears of gratitude that I had been vaccinated. I really doubt I would be here to the tell the tale if I was unvaccinated.   


If people are not getting the vaccine because they are going to get sick anyway, that's not a good enough reason, because it could prevent them from dying or getting seriously ill. The number of people dying from Covid are significantly higher for those who are unvaccinated versus unvaccinated. Of those dying and vaccinated, the median age is 74 with 4.5 comorbidities (65% of people who died after being fully vaccinated, were older than 65). Those unvaccinated who are dying have a median age of 53 with 3 or more comorbidities.   


The vaccine may have stopped the earlier variants from spreading, but now it's job is to keep people out of the hospital, thus causing hospitals to become overrun, as well as prevent death for the vast majority.",,,,1631039447,{},hbymx3r,False,t3_phux91,False,True,t1_hbmwzxz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/phux91/if_youre_unvaccinated_the_cdc_wants_you_to_stay/hbymx3r/,1631110646.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_5l767rpb,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But, to clarify, to me ""reliable"" protection means for a fully vaccinated person, the worst case scenario should be an illness comparable to an average case of flu or common cold infection.  After all, in US, that's how the vaccines were sold to the public who wanted to get their shots ASAP.

I did have covid once or twice before I got a chance to get vaxxed.  In both cases, things were completely manageable with cough syrup and a day or two of rest.  Both times, there was an impact to taste and smell enough to make comfort foods stop being comfort foods.

This latest episode is far worse.  I'm almost completely symptom free eight days after testing positive and no trouble breathing or anything hospital worthy like that.  On the other hand, I did run a bunch of light errands today that got put off in order to self-isolate.  At least the ones that could be done without being around other people too much.  My stomach is still acting up, and I got super tired from doing stuff that was only slightly physical.  Not feeling confident at all about returning to work this Thursday.  Hopefully they will give me Thursday and Friday off as well so I can recover more to come back Monday.

A number of others pointed out that it's an equally likely possibility that the vaccine is what kept me being laid out sick at home vs getting far sicker and being laid out in an ICU bed hooked up to a machine.  Can't dispute that one.  I'm male, 37, medium body build, but smoker, vaping, and high blood pressure.  So, I'll concede the above :).

I'm just angry, disappointed, and disheartened that we're still dealing with this crap at a time when many of us believed we'd be able to just get vaccinated and put the pandemic behind us by now.

Me and my dad had an overly social distanced meetup at New Year's Eve at the end of 2020 (he never even got a garage haircut by then).  We agreed to gather up for proper celebration after at least one of us got properly vaxxed.

Unfortunately, he had what appeared to be a very mild heart attack in March 2021.  He went to a hospital and was kept under observation for two nights.  Back then, it was stupidly easy to jump the vaccine line, but I had to tell him that only the last doctor to work on him could tell if it was safe for him to get poked, cuz... heart issues.

He finally did go out and get his Moderna shots (2nd being on Aug 03), but now I'm still struggling on how to tell him about still getting sick despite vaxx, but maybe early October will be good as long as no symptoms on either end.

Vaccination alone was never likely to do the job.  You've got to combine efforts.  But politics has made it 1 strategy vs no strategy.

It's moronic, because if you look at the data you see just how effective stacking strategies are.

It's even moronic since this is the only thing people object to compound strategies on.  You don't decide seatbelt or airbag when you get in a car.  You don't decide if you want an airplane seat with a life preserver or an oxygen mask when you board a plane.  You obviously get both.

But for some reason when it comes to this virus, it's either vaccine, mask or nothing.  And in the US at least, both Republicans and Democrats are responsible for that mess.

&gt; The variant now known as Mu was mostly detected in July, according to analyses completed between June 19 and Aug. 21, the Department of Public Health said.

&gt; Named after the 12th letter of the Greek alphabet, Mu was declared by the World Health Organization as a ‚Äúvariant of interest‚Äù on Aug. 30, and was first identified in January in Colombia, the department said. Mu, also known as B.1.621, has since been reported in 39 countries.

&gt; The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, however, has not labeled Mu a variant of interest.

&gt; Variants of interest are not considered as much of a potential threat as so-called ‚Äúvariants of concern,‚Äù which include Delta. Delta is now estimated to comprise more than 99% of the variants circulating in the United States. The Delta variant displaced Alpha as the nation‚Äôs most dominant strain at the beginning of the summer.
