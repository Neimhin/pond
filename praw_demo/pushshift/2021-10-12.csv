I actually am weakly opposed against general population mandates simply because it is causing **such** a major pushback that it is becoming a fight that is getting too messy. When kids can get vaccinated and boosters are there for those who want them, anybody who wants to get protection can get it; it's their choice.

Want to get a booster? Cool, you're probably pretty darn well protected.

Got a shot but got cold feet about a booster? OK, you *already know* the risk, and nobody is hiding it from you. Besides, your protection is still pretty good.

Don't want the vaccine? Hmm... but like above, practically everyone knows what the risks are, and whatever their reasoning is, I probably can't change it. I do think that healthcare workers should need the vaccine or an antibody test (assuming they're accurate... I haven't kept much track of them).

*That being said,* I tend to still ask what their reason is in a genuine way. I was able to convince a good chunk of my friend and family group to get vaccinated because their hesitation was with mRNA technology. Instead of taking the debate head on, I just sidestepped it and told them to consider J&amp;J, since viral vectors have been used in other vaccines and is a more mature technology. It worked! And if anyone tried to pooh-pooh on J&amp;J, I just told them, ""I doubt that you could convince people hesitant about mRNA that it is safe without longer term studies of this exact vaccine, it is an effective vaccine against the virus, and it is far, FAR better than just going unvaccinated.""",,,,1634114110,{},hgglz0j,False,t3_q70yjn,False,False,t1_hgg9wx5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q70yjn/pediatric_covid19_vaccine_likely_widely_available/hgglz0j/,1634238492.0,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes, as we know it is still possible to die as a vaccinated person. We also know you are 5x less likely to be infected, 10x less likely to be hospitalised, 10x less likely to be killed. 

I don‚Äôt understand your point about getting Covid tested. If they‚Äôre in hospital for reasons unrelated to Covid‚Ä¶then how does that matter while talking about vaccinated people in hospital *for covid*.

&gt; Navigating personal and familial relationships will become trickier. Whether we like it or not, Covid-19 is shrinking our social circles and our spheres of interaction. **After all, interactions with strangers now come with the additional threat of being exposed to the virus**. Should one really meet up with an almost-friend, a work acquaintance etc if it is not absolutely necessary? The answer for most people is no. Here too, virtual interactions will become the norm and so will our openness to considering them equivalent to real interactions in a way we would have refused a mere two years ago.

&gt; With WHO officials announcing that Covid-19 is here to stay, the writing is on the wall. The government must consider sustainable measures to combat surges which threaten to occur again and again, and invest in greater connectivity so that everyone has access to remote working and learning. Furthermore, government services provision, tax collection etc must all be shifted online to prevent as many people as possible from having to line up repeatedly for this or that. The virus is here to stay so **points of physical interaction between people must be reduced in every way possible**. Finally, the poor who can access none of these measures and who are being offered up as Covid-fodder desperately need more humanitarian assistance and support. In simple terms, being resigned to the perpetual presence of Covid-19 need not mean being similarly resigned to the death of millions.

As you can see, it just turns into another beautiful piece of creative writing like the ones we saw in March 2020. You know, the ones that predicted the world would become a dystopian VR-addicted future because of Covid. Mind you, the article was posted **10 days ago**

Like, for fuck's sake, do these people even realise that these articles are only gonna depress people and embolden antivaxxers? We have incredibly effective vaccines that are reducing transmittion and letality everywhere, in Europe clubs are reopening, some countries have even ditched masks... and yet some people still insist on writing down their delirium caused by too many watchings of *Demolition Man* and posting it on the Web.

Worst case is still longer than after the second dose, since you get several times more antibody titers after the third dose than the second.

But we have no research yet on antibody titer decay rate after the third dose.

That's ignoring cellular immunity, and we have no research on that either.  After infection you appear to have a significant t-cell response, that prevents infection even after antibodies start dropping on [this graph](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01377-8).  But we don't know if a third dose accomplishes that as well, to change the shape of the graph permanently.

There does seem to be a fundamental difference versus measles, where you can be infected but due to the 12-day incubation period your body fights it off before you're contagious.

Well because it's not 99% if hospitals are swamped but even if it's 99%, that's for everyone averaged out and per infection.

That said.  Perhaps current vaccines are not the ideal design for VE against infection, but we know for a fact that for a good while (lets say 6 months) they do in fact hold up fairly well against infection.

Combine with the fact they've had zero restrictions since July with even face masks no longer mandatory. 

Although tbh I'd say it's rather encouraging looking at their data. I mean their cases is roughly a similar level to case rates back in January and has been sky high since July. But at the same time while deaths have risen it has only marginally risen and is still fairly low. 7DA is now 123 and the highest it went to recently was 143. Compared to January levels when they were in hard lockdown with similar case rates they were getting 1,200+ deaths a day. Hospitalizations has also remained lower than the January peak.

Although I have great confidence in pilots, and as mentioned I am a frequent traveler, I question if the existing system of pilot reporting is sufficient to provide adequate safe response to dynamic weather conditions. Until the FAA, and international governing bodies, come up more a more accurate and local scale weather reporting system, I am not comfortable flying with simple PIREPs providing local adverse weather events.

If by ""others"" you mean the general public, then yes. The risk to the general public remains high because there's a pool of petri dishes that a completely preventable virus is using to mutate and potentially become more infectious and/or deadly (see ""Delta"").

I don't know where this whole ""consent"" thing came from. It's a workplace that is protecting its workforce by protecting both the employees and customers from people who *choose* to potentially spread a completely preventable virus. We get lots of vaccines throughout our lives to no detrimental effect. If one believes that vaccines cause harm, they can join the vocal minority who also believe that.

I'm not arguing a point nobody is making, I'm making an [argument ad absurdum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum#:~:text=In%20logic%2C%20reductio%20ad%20absurdum,that%20the%20opposite%20scenario%20would) to illustrate that ""ignoring the consent portion of a violation of consent"" is not actually addressing the scope of the problem. The person I responded to argued as if the only variable in consideration was in regards to whether or not the violation of consent would actually result in the intended outcome.

&gt; I don't know where this whole ""consent"" thing came from.

It comes from making people do something that they don't want to do by force.

&gt; It's a workplace that is protecting its workforce by protecting both the employees and customers from people who choose to potentially spread a completely preventable virus. We get lots of vaccines throughout our lives to no detrimental effect

Yes, I understand the motivation to vaccinate. This is why I chose to get vaccinated. And if I ran a private business, I would consider requiring my employees to vaccinate. However, when it comes to the state, I think there is a heavy onus that falls upon the citizens in order to determine exactly which threshold of risk is being breached in order to consider using the force of the state against your fellow citizens. By my estimation, COVID, although devastating, doesn't cross the risk threshold in order for me to be comfortable with that. More importantly, the available vaccines (mRNA/viral vector), while impressive feats of science/medicine, are such a radical departure from any technology ever deployed at scale, in combination with a novel antigen, that I think that there is sufficient reason for people to be uncomfortable taking the vaccine. For me to be remotely comfortable with a mandate, I would personally need for the available vaccines to either be an attenuated virus vaccine, or a synthetic protein vaccine (Novavax), and even then...I would be seriously conflicted about a mandate.

And there are two other things to consider if we're actually being serious about what is being done here. For one, the notion that an antibody test isn't sufficient to demonstrate alternatively acquired immunity is absurd. No scientifically literate person would contest this, and that fact that proof of immune response isn't counted towards any of these mandates in the US is proof that this entire thing is tainted by political nonsense.

The second is that determining the role of the vaccines as it pertains to the spread of the disease is a conversation drastically altered by Delta and the changing profile of immunity as vaccine efficacy wanes. The vaccines have demonstrated to be highly efficacious against infectivity and spread for 2 months after vaccination, after which the presence of antibodies rapidly diminishes. The remaining efficacy is from the longer-lasting T-Cell immunity, which primarily provides protection against hospitalization and death, but is not fast enough to prevent infection or spread with the rapidly reproducing Delta variant. So the conversation regarding vaccines, as you've framed it, is not entirely accurate. Vaccines which were administered more than a few months ago are playing a seriously diminished role in regards to the epidemiological aspect of the pandemic, and more in terms of protecting the individual who actually received the vaccine from the worst outcomes of the disease.",,,,1634159215,{},hgj6buo,False,t3_q78quh,False,True,t1_hgixs94,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q78quh/vaccine_hesitant_new_yorkers_consider_leaving_the/hgj6buo/,1634288325.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; 
&gt; * Charge you for a vaccine
&gt; * Charge you directly for any administration fees, copays, or coinsurance
&gt; * Deny vaccination to anyone who does not have health insurance coverage, is underinsured, or is out of network

&gt; * Require additional services in order for a person to receive a COVID-19 vaccine; however, additional healthcare services can be provided at the same time and billed as appropriate

Unfortunately the immune system is more complicated than that. We don't fully understand exactly what causes an exposure to lead to an infection, but it's definitely more complicated than you're immune or you aren't.

* First, the immune system is made up of two broad parts: the [innate immune system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system) and the [adaptive immune system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system). The former is all of the mechanisms that keep germs away from your body in general like your skin, the mucus in your nose, etc., while the latter is things like antibodies, B cells, and T cells that learn to identify and fight off specific pathogens. Sometimes when you get exposed to a virus, your innate immune system is able to stop it before it becomes a real problem. Otherwise, it usually takes your adaptive immune system some time to mount a response, which you sometimes don't notice (maybe you're a little extra tired for a couple days but not even enough for it to register as being sick) or you get noticeable symptoms like a cold/fever.
* There's been a lot of talk about ""viral load"". Basically, a viral infection is made up of **a lot** of viral particles. If you're exposed to just a single viral particle, it will almost certainly fail to infect you. But if you're exposed to enough, the virus has a much higher chance of getting a foothold and managing to become a significant infection. Asymptomatic people probably transmit fewer viral particles than, say, someone coughing on you, although we do have evidence that they can transmit enough to get someone else sick, that doesn't mean they always will.
* Also, even if you have been infected previously, immunity wanes, and vaccination after infection gives significantly more immunity than infection alone.",,,,1634078531,{},hgevoho,False,t3_q6gbwu,False,False,t1_hgdvjcz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q6gbwu/daily_discussion_thread_october_12_2021/hgevoho/,1634204124.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think healthy skepticism is fine. Your skepticism is misplaced in this case though. The vaccine makers have every incentive in the world to make sure that these vaccines are safe and effective. The eyes of the entire world are on them and any fuck up could have massive repercussions. The standard model doesn't apply here.

&gt; Countless medications have been approved that have later had to be withdrawn due to terrible side effects.

I've already explained how side effects for vaccines are all detected early in their usage. The FDA and all the other agencies put these vaccines through all the standard testing protocols under intense scrutiny. They refused to fast track any vaccines in time for the November election even though Trump pushed them *hard* to do so in time to give him a win.

&gt;Only dumb people catch COVID? 

I never said that. I said that you are dumb which makes it unsurprising to me that you caught COVID. Dumb people take stupid pointless risks which I'm sure you did.

In this study, 100ug Moderna looks mostly the best, but Pfizer wasn't very far behind. All the boosters significantly raised antibodies.

[],,KaneMomona,,,[],,,,text,t2_11luad,False,False,,"This line of thinking has been used a lot during the pandemic, that because something isn't absolute it isn't worth doing. Masks aren't 100% so why bother, vaccines aren't 100% so why bother etc. 

It's about the numbers, if somebody is 70% less likely to transmit or catch covid while wearing a mask is that worth it. Same with the vaccine. If I said your taxes were going to be reduced 70% would that be worth it? 

I'm not 100% sold on a mandate for the general public but for certain professions that are high risk (food prep) or unavoidable (police, healthcare, grocery store) or national security (armed forces) then it's a no brainer. 

Another serious issue is the misrepresentation of statistics. We see why bother if it has a 99% survival rate? Well because it's not 99% if hospitals are swamped but even if it's 99%, that's for everyone averaged out and per infection. We are seeing multiple infections in unvaxxed people, so that 1% fatality rate could be every 3 months. Then we have to look at the risks of mutations which could result in either a more or less deadly or virulent strain. The more mutation the more risk. Then we have the crux of the issue, are we prepared to take a very small risk of vaccination (0.0018% ?)  to protect our elders who are at much higher risk of death even when vaccinated. Personally, I see it as my duty to do so. Others have a more self centric decision making process. 

Covid could have been isolated, it could have been defeated. We needed more transparency from China early on, we needed stronger health service bodies to do what was correct, not what was politically expedient for their overlords. We needed to actually lock down country wide and have closed our borders earlier.

I think it depends how you look at it.  Mathematically speaking, even if the vaccine is highly efficacious at say 90% VE against infection, if you increase the pool of infected people significantly, that 10% is still a rather large number.  Also very obviously infection means spread.

It's too bad the goalposts are shifting so often at the CDC/FDA in regard to VE, now creating yet another rift in the population.

There are exceptions of course.)

I'm not aware of a single shutdown in the last six months, and stadiums are filling up again and state fairs were held. I went to the state fair for my state on Labor Day. Many workers had masks and there were a smattering of masks in the crowds but at least 80% of the crowds were unmasked. I'm guessing this drove up our positive tests. My state appears to have peaked last week, we will see.

My point is, this is the first sharp downtrend in the united states NOT due to shutdowns or curfews or the govt begging people not to gather. but one could argue that the post-summer decline is like the after-christmas decline, people are ""done gathering"" because the weather (north), or they are ""done gathering inside"" because its no longer too hot outside (south). The last CDC mandate that I could find was subway/bus related Feb 1st - March 9th? 2021 (not sure about end date). The CDC released guidance that vaccinated individuals could gather indoors without masks on March 9th.

I think we'll have more answers soon. meanwhile, 65% of americans have some vaccine protection and an additional XX% are immune through contracting and surviving COVID (im convinced its some double digit number but I won't pretend to know which one.) I think this is having as large an effect on the downtrend as the weather. We probably haven't reached herd immunity, but herd immunity isn't like flipping a switch. As we approach herd immunity, we should expect to see positive cases drop because the number of people the virus can use as a vector is diminishing.

You'd almost have to trade him to another contender, he'd have to have some say on where, and with that the Nets lose all leverage and have to wonder if it really makes sense trading a player of his caliber to a potential rival as it will be tough to get back equal on-court value.

Like what? How many vaccines in the past have had ""long term side effects""? In nearly all cases, if someone is going to have a reaction to a vaccine it is going to be immediate and severe, e.g. anaphylactic shock. There is only one case in history where I can think of a vaccine side effect that occurred outside of 30 days, and that was a flu vaccine where some people had an elevated occurrence of narcolepsy 6-9 months out from the vaccine.

Vaccine trials started in March 2020. Moderna and Pfizer published the results of their first clinical trials on July 14th and August 12th. It's now Oct 2021, so the first trial patients are 19 months out from their first doses. Frontline healthcare workers started getting their doses in Dec 2020, so they are 10 months out from their first doses. *If there were long term side effects, we would know about them by now*. How many years have to go by before you drop this lame excuse?

Regardless of your age group and health, your risk of death from COVID is higher than the risk of death from the vaccine. Your risk of long term side effects from COVID (36%) is higher than the risk of long term side effects from the vaccine (0%).",,,,1634142290,{},hgi07dj,False,t3_q78quh,False,True,t1_hght52g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q78quh/vaccine_hesitant_new_yorkers_consider_leaving_the/hgi07dj/,1634266969.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  I was on Omeprazole which really helped when i took it every day. It was easy to know it was heartburn as i could have a couple of cokes and burping had acid come up letting me know.

The only thing that got rid of it for me was following intermittent fasting and only eating between 12pm and 8pm which i was doing to loose weight but the side effect was that heart burn dropped completely as i didn't eat  for 5 hours before bed and dropped soda etc.   I did loose 40 lbs (regained 20) which also could of  dropped been a large part of it.

First, ""Trans-women"" and ""non-trans-women"" are artifical distinctions. We are all just women. :-)   

Next, thankfully, doctors are able to provide gender affirming hormone therapy for trans people that can or want to go this route. So hormone levels can match to how we identify, just as hormone levels match for the gender that cis people identify as. Cool, huh? In this way, there would be no difference in how the body responds to the virus or the vaccine. A trans woman and cis woman will have the same reaction as determined by hormones. 

As far as ACE2 levels, extra X chromosomes, and organ size, this is something that there is not a therapy for -- yet. But the main thing to remember is that gender is an identity, not a physiological state. So, yeah, there are some areas where a trans person's body's response is going to look similar to the gender that was mis-assigned at birth. But even here, there is the same misconception. Gender isn't a biological or physiological state. It's an identity. So there is no ""female"" reaction to the vaccine.

The correct answer is two fold

1. Lay the information out for them at clearly and non politically as possible (this has been done to a certain extent but both sides are still highly political about it)
2. AND THEN DO NOT SAY ANYTHING. Do not engage, do not feel sorry, happy, or mad, about anything they say regarding the subject. Let it stew in their mind in solitude. This can be hard with social media.

The reason this works is because its easy to find your mistakes / grow when no one is pressuring you to. It allows an escape method of 'just doing it and not telling anyone' ect ect. The problem is people hate to be wrong, or to 'betray their tribe.' When those things combine, it can take a lot to change a opinion, so the best way is to let them think it out without outside pressure. Any pressure applied will often make them double down on opinions they have already formed.

[],,tokinUP,,,[],,,,text,t2_4iysw,False,False,,"Yup. Pro-vax and very scientific-minded here. Generally not an early-adopter but I've been wearing N95's after realizing SARS1 was already known to be airborne and that meant SARS2 likely was as well, despite what WHO/CDC first said.

I trust our scientists, CDC, FDA, etc. but I saw how much the early messaging was tilted towards ""what's best for the whole country"" propaganda and trying not to incite panic vs. communicating the reality of the severe lockdowns needed.

I don't trust profit-motivated pharmaceutical companies to not have pushed this too soon, capitalism is pushing hard for everyone to get back to work regardless of safety. So I've been waiting to make sure this isn't another [Dengue vaccine debacle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_vaccine) (where being vaccinated first made actually being infected later *worse*) or some other unknown-unknown pops up like major autoimmune problems 2 years out. (Though at this point I feel the vaccines are unlikely to have any major issues like that)

Also there are perverse disincentives... my workplace will only continue to provide SARS2 rapid antigen tests for undeclared vaccination status/unvaccinated. I feel like it's a good idea for *everyone* to keep being tested regularly even once vaccinated until at least hospital capacity stabilizes. Even once vaccinated I don't want to have to prove that status to my workplace, I feel that's medical information they're not entitled to and shouldn't have.
- AND - work is pushing everyone back to the office ASAP once vaccinated... where they're all not wearing masks, which I don't feel is a good idea with the current non-sterilizing vaccines since they're going to spread SARS2 while hospital capacities are still maxed out.

I am totally fine with continuing to take strict precautions, I won't eat anywhere indoors, etc. to get as much information as I can on all this to make the best decisions. It's definitely looking like getting vaccinated right away would've been a better decision than waiting, but I'm fine with having not taken that risk yet. (Oh, and I've kept most of this to myself and have only advised others *to get vaccinated* because most of my concerns would probably turn out OK).

Today covid causes disruption on global scales, and with the freedom of movement between states a single state not vaccinating threatens commerce and medical systems in surrounding states.  It is a federal level issue as no state can coordinate with all of its neighbors as effectively as the federal government can.

I also find this personal medical freedom being touted very hypocritical in most people i have met who use it as an excuse.

&gt;Experts say no single factor can explain the extraordinary turnaround in Japan‚Äô fortunes.

&gt;But there is broad consensus that after a frustratingly slow start, its vaccination rollout has transformed into an impressive public health campaign that has met with little of the resistance that has slowed the rollout in the US, despite Japan‚Äôs complicated historical relationship with inoculations.

&gt;To date, Japan has administered Covid vaccines to protect almost 70% of its 126 million population.

&gt;The government has said that vaccines will have been given to everyone who wants them by November, while this week the new prime minister, Fumio Kishida, said booster shots would be offered from December, beginning with medical workers and older people.

&gt;Another factor cited by experts is the widespread wearing of masks ‚Äì a habit ingrained during pre-pandemic flu seasons. As other countries drop requirements for face coverings in indoor and other settings, most Japanese still shudder at the thought of venturing out maskless.

My university, USC, has a vaccine mandate, a flu shot mandate, and a weekly screening that denies anyone access to campus if they feel sick. LA County guidelines also mean there is an indoor mask mandate. Despite all of this and a test positivity rate of 0.08%, they are refusing to stop testing us weekly. Am I missing something, or does this just not make sense? If anything, it gives off the wrong perception that vaccines don't work well, which they absolutely do! 

From my perspective, it is clear that COVID is not spreading on campus. The university itself has already moved the goalposts several times on when this weekly testing will go away, even though positivity rates have gone down literally every week since we arrived on campus. At first it was once their modeling of cases going down was accurate, then it was 2 more weeks of positive data. It's been 4 weeks of ""2 more weeks"" and now they're telling us testing will be around for the ""foreseeable future"". 

This concerns me, because it makes me think that there is no endgame. If COVID was going to spread on campus, it would've by now considering packed student sections at football games, maskless parties, packed classrooms and people living together, etc. I almost feel like a crazy person for questioning it, and it really is a small thing at the end of the day, but it concerns me greatly.",,,,1634120235,{},hggss0n,False,t3_q75mfh,False,False,t3_q75mfh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q75mfh/daily_discussion_thread_october_13_2021/hggss0n/,1634242384.0,21,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;Nicole Sperry combating Covid misinformation at a Chesapeake Public School Board meeting on Monday, October 12, 2021, a day after burying her daughter, who died from the deadly virus.  
&gt;  
&gt;""My message for you and all that are listening is that Covid is not over, no matter what people who have been standing up here have said,"" Sperry, who also teaches in the district, said during Monday's meeting. ""On September 27, during the last meeting, there were parents or concerned citizens that voiced misinformation to you.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""They said that Covid is basically over and that healthy people do not die. When they were sharing this information, their opinions, the fact was, I was sitting next to my healthy daughter's deathbed. She died five days after showing symptoms. I am sure they were speaking to what they've experienced, but they are wrong.""

Chesapeake is my home town and there were several people on the school board trying to buck the CDC guidelines on masks until the Governor stepped in and reminded them that CDC guidelines were required by law to be followed.

What you aren't considering is that they may not necessarily be eating too much but what are the nutrition facts of what they're eating.  Even bread, a staple in most low income homes, is spiked with unnecessary sugar.  Second,  health foods are more expensive making them out of the budget for many poor families.  Lastly, you mentioned exercise.  A lot of these kids live in neighborhoods not conducive with frequent outdoor activity.  Usually there needs to be adult supervision but often in the homes the parents work and are not home enough to supply recreational time for their kids. Of course we could all point out how kids shouldn't be living in these conditions but again, they aren't responsible for their current circumstances.

First, prosecutorial discretion has been around for centuries and pre-dates the United States. Our tradition is rooted in older English law. It's a well-established practice and doesn't correlate with levels of trust in the government.

Second, federalism in the US means that police powers follow the same federal/state divide as does legislation. Federal officers enforce federal laws while state officers enforce state laws. State officers may arrest people on federal charges to turn them over to the federal government (and vice versa) but they have their own jurisdiction with state laws they're charged to enforce.

The federal government does not fund federal law enforcement to pursue low-level offenders (e.g., casual marijuana users). There aren't enough DEA agents. This means prosecutorial discretion is a necessary requirement of law and order because we want the DEA to focus on the violent and dangerous offenders, not those who don't pose a risk to society.

Nevertheless, maintaining those federal laws still gives the federal government leverage over low-level offenders by offering them immunity in exchange for information on more serious offenders).

I agree with you that marijuana should be legalized nationwide and I'm looking forward to the day it happens, but federal marijuana laws are not really an apples-to-apples comparison with federal mask mandates.

A more apt comparison would be Texas refusing to enforce federal vaccine mandates, which it has the authority to do.",,,,1634092293,{},hgfpda7,False,t3_q6z0ei,False,False,t1_hgflz2s,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q6z0ei/rebuffing_texas_governor_american_airlines/hgfpda7/,1634219756.0,13,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Your kids will do these things.  There is even an argument to be made that doing these things in moderation is a valuable and relevant life experience, a part of growing up.

People in customer-facing jobs are tested regularly and even residential wastewaster is tested regularly to identify hidden cases. Until recently, we had very aggressive contact-tracing, testing and isolation of close contacts. Our hospitalization rates were also high because we were giving medical attention to people who didn't need it.

It was only until the health system could not take the burden of taking on these mild/asymptomatic cases that the government changed tack. And the funny thing is that the population is either so afraid of the virus or so afraid of breaking the rules that they are still overwhelming the health system.

It's not the severe cases that are sucking up our healthcare resources but the many mild/asymptomatic ones who are overly concerned with either the health or legal consequences.

And my point about profiteering remains because there's no chance they had enough participants to find a difference between 100 and 50.

Nothing in the data shows the myocarditis risk is a danger to anyone outside young men under 21. Nuking a booster for 65+ and others at risk over that has no basis in data. And even for under 21s.. there's just no good reason to believe it's a better trade-off unless you're inappropriately comparing hospitalization risk of covid to mild myocarditis, rather than covid induced myocarditis to vaccine induced myocarditis. But tbf, that does seem to be their game.

Whether they could have used it all along... That's not clear at all. There was a substantial difference between 25ug and 100ug, and 100ug and 250ug. Pfizer had a similar substantial difference between their 30ug group and 100ug group.

So at this point employers that mandate the vaccine need to also ensure employees have paid time off to get vaccinated and are given adequate sick time to cover any time off needed as a result of getting the vaccine.

I have to add that the number of people who have died as a result of the vaccine are extremely small, and pales in comparison to the number of people who have died of COVID. However people do experience side effects as a result of the vaccine, most are nothing more than tiredness and a headache, other experience full on flu like symptoms for a day or two; I was one of them, after getting the vaccine I was out with what felt like the flu for a good 12 hours. So we can't mandate the vaccine but not give employees time off to get vaccinated and we can't mandate the vaccine and expect an employee to take sick or unpaid time off as a result of the vaccine side effects.

Here's a cool source documenting what Ivermectin overdose looks like: https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2021/han00449.asp
It is well documented. 

Not denying for a second that it's on the WHO's list of essential medicines. It is. Doesn't mean it can't be overdosed on. And yes, Tylenol has a smaller therapeutic window than Ivermectin. I'm giving you an example of a safe drug that can still be overdosed on and Tylenol is the first example that came to mind. 

Picking entirely random drugs for the WHO EML for reference here I see Atropine, Diazepam, and Insulin. 3 examples from entirely different classes of drugs that can all cause overdoses if used improperly. 

Ivermectin is mainly used to treat parasites in humans and animals. It does work in rare cases on other things, including flaviviruses like Dengue and WNV. However, its' efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 is not well documented. One of the largest studies supporting its' use was an Egyptian study that made up a whole bunch of its data. https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/16/huge-study-supporting-ivermectin-as-covid-treatment-withdrawn-over-ethical-concerns

Your intuition is backwards. The reason the vaccines were allowed to move so fast is *because* everyone's eyes were on them, not in spite of it. The relevant agencies dropped literally everything to put all eyes on the vaccine development in order to move things through immediately if they looked good and stop them immediately if anything went wrong. These vaccines were developed under the greatest scrutiny of probably any drugs ever made.

As for why they're not responsible, it's because the US has a specially set aside fund for compensating anyone that is injured by a vaccine. We decided to do this because it's faster, easier, and there's so few actual cases of vaccine injury that it's better to just pay out from a central fund rather than deal with personal injury lawyers gumming up the legal system every time grandma croaks from an unrelated stroke two weeks after getting a flu shot.

Pfizer for instance has been administered 600 million times in the US and EU (globally will be more obviously), so lets say that for boosters twice a year, that's conservatively  1 billion shots a year, at a pandemic pricing of $20 per shot, that's $20 billion (not mentioning that pfizer wants to increase the shot costs too).  Pfizer in 2019 did $50B in revenue, so their covid vaccine turns into a new opportunity to increase their annual sales by 40%,  and you don't think that their decision-making is biased?

We do let our teens get together with other vaccinated teens/families indoors/unmasked because they need to get back to some sense of normalcy &amp; that should be a pretty safe scenario.
