While my local hospital is full capacity (I think), I haven't talked to one person I know that has either gotten sick enough to be admitted, or known someone who died. Everyone among my conversations have either been quarantined or known someone to get quarantined. Also not every local hospital is capable to care for covid patients, and get sent to larger hospitals counties away.

I myself have been quarantined in the past. While it is affecting the elderly and nursing homes more so, the community as a whole still argues the effectiveness of masks and complains about a mask mandate. This is argued daily in pretty much any given commonplace. Yet I would guess roughly 40% or more people don't wear a mask at Walmart. 

It's aggravating as fuck to watch this all happen. The pandemic just didn't hit smaller towns until after the ""first wave"" was over. Even then it just didn't hit as hard. Then when the country seemed to improve, covid snuck in to smaller communities. Out here it really only does seem to affect the elderly. There is this weird consensus that we don't have the problems that big cities like NYC, or even Kansas City or Denver for that matter. On some level it is partially true. Then when we do have those problems, shit gets blamed on so many excuses. Rather than take it seriously, so many people choose to blame others for causing spread of the virus. Or think that if no one I know got sick, then I won't. Then they get pissed when great grandma dies.

That said, challenge trials aren't necessary to begin vaccinations. Depending on the size of the trial, they may have something along the lines of:

* 50k in the vaccine group, 50k in the placebo group
* In the vaccine group, 22 developed disease over three months;
* In the placebo group, 439 developed disease over three months;
* In the vaccine group, 44,000 tested positive for antibodies after the trial;
* In the placebo group, 1,000 tested positive for antibodies after the trial.

(Completely made up numbers, of course, and definitely not a target).

That would be an extremely effective vaccine and the benefits of giving that to the population would be clear.

A challenge trial would be useful in telling you what level of exposure might lead to infection, or what level of antibodies offers sterilising immunity to prevent positive test results in future.

Irrelevant stat.  We only care about fatality rate, not % of people in ICU.  Young people have been infected at much higher rates and represent a much higher portion of the population.

&gt;There are just as many factors to consider back in 1918 that would have negatively effected outcomes as there are today.

Not really.  The overwhelming majority of COVID deaths are people who are really old.  Your chances of dying from this virus go up by about 10x for every 15 years you age.  The young demographics of the early 20th century would have almost certainly been the primary factor in this hypothetical.  The 1918 pandemic would have also been significantly less severe in western countries if it occurred today for the same reason.

That would be the evidence you need here to say it’s not seasonal.  If you have that evidence I’d be happy to see it, too, honestly, cuz I am just going from what I know and would be happy to learn something new.  But even then it’s not really enough evidence, I don’t think.

It’s not that no one dies from the flu in the summer, it’s that the influenza virus has a harder time in the warmer months infecting people before being destroyed by the immune system, along with other diseases like pneumonia having a harder time as well.  

The fact that fewer people catch and die of the flu in the summer than do in the winter is a product of heat driving people apart and cold driving them together.  If anything, you should expect this virus to be **more** seasonal because people in enclosed spaces = higher transmission rate.  Being seasonal is generally entirely to do with how the virus is transmitted.  As long as it’s host is an appropriate temperature it’s fine, regardless of time of year.  Deaths go up and down according to how the virus spreads.

My point is that, yes, a lot more people die from the flu in the winter, but people still die from it in the summer.  The same is true of covid, it simply has a higher baseline of death, and we don’t really know what that baseline is yet because there hasn’t been enough time to know.  Eventually COVID deaths will track along with flu deaths, a valley and peak according to the seasons of the year, they will just be a curve that is much higher on the Y axis.

What you are seeing with this *novel* virus so far is it trying to climb to its baseline as countries desperately take measures to try to not get even close to that baseline.

\- It is about a tightening of the councils, says Anders Tegnell at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon.

For several weeks now, the Uppsala Region has wanted opportunities to make local rules of conduct to reduce the increasing spread of infection in the area. As recently as last week, the regulations were changed so that from this week it is possible to do so.

#### The guidelines

On Tuesday, the news came that stricter general advice applies to Uppsala County:

* Avoid physical contact with people other than those you live with.
* Discouragement from arranging or participating in parties or similar social gatherings.
* The tightened general guidelines also include various activities such as shops, sports facilities and workplaces.
* Avoid using public transport or public transport.
* As an employer, you should encourage staff to work from home and offer staff increased opportunities to do so.
* It is important to continue to seek care when needed.

The advice is valid from Tuesday 20 October to 3 November, after which the effects of the measures will be evaluated, but the time can also be extended. **But it is not a question of a local lockdown,** Anders Tegnell believes.

\- If you are going to a restaurant, feel free to do so, but do it with family and those you hang out with. Try to reduce the close contact with other people than those you normally hang out with a lot, ie those you live with.

#### General spread of infection in Uppsala County

This is not about so-called  *cluster spread* in Uppsala County, although in some cases the infection can be linked to individual gatherings according to the Public Health Agency.

\- We see an increased spread of  *society*  in Uppsala, says Anders Tegnell.

The Swedish Public Health Agency has not introduced recommendations for entry and exit for the Uppsala region. But other counties may also receive similar guidelines in the future.

Read more about the advice on the Swedish Public Health Agency's website [here](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/nyheter-och-press/nyhetsarkiv/2020/oktober/beslut-om-skarpta-allmanna-rad-i-uppsala-lan/) .

This is not a lockdown and these restrictions are going to be difficult to enforce:

&gt; The new measures, described by Bitte Brastad, the chief legal officer at Sweden's public health agency, as ""something in between regulations and recommendations,"" do not come with fines for any violations.

Unbeknownst to them, the science community is always learning about a virus as more and more studies are done on it, yet sadly anti-maskers interpret those changing of minds/stances as a loss in credibility.

This point has clearly not been stressed enough in a lot of Western countries. 

There comes a point and age when if you get sick, the right thing to do, for family and carers is to ease pain and suffering but let go. 

My grandmother, who lived with us from my birth till she died (I was 31), and was like a mother, passed at 91 from pneumonia complications derived from a flu... The doctors offered us twice to put her on ventilators and ICU, twice.  I remember my parents and sibling being surprised that in january, in Madrid (Madrids hospitals always reach 95% capacity and plus in flu season) they would insist on following protocol even if the patient was 91...to have placed her in ICU with a ventilator would have likely killed her anyway, dragged the suffering for her and us on for days or weeks and best case, given us a quasi vegetative person who would have hated to see herself that way if she ever really regained full consciousness over the few weeks she would have gotten in exchange. We obviously asked the doctors to let her go without pain or suffering, as legal and quickly as possible so we could wait by her side till she was gone.  Even so it took 3 days... 

After all was over I remember having this creepy feeling for years regarding protocol and advance care resource management, in this case in Madrid Spain... Because I thought if ever the flu or something else gets out of hand, and they're putting the first sick on ventilators in ICU, that means that in a week you'll have the whole system overloaded with 85 plus year olds and no space when the 60s and 70s show up...

For the first time since this pandemic started - I have been having issues with my anxiety levels. Normally I have this shit on lockdown. I am a single mother with two special needs children. All three of us are high-risk. No friends or family live close (as I did not anticipate a pandemic when moving away three years ago). If I were to pass away, the kids would go into foster care - and they would be unable to communicate even when they are classified by neuropsychological evaluation as having IQ's in the 78th and 97th percentiles. This inability to properly communicate paired with chronic, severe pain makes them statistically likely to suffer abuse in foster care or at school. You have no idea how *hard* I work under *normal circumstances* to keep such things from happening. They NEED me.

So clearly Covid-19 would have killed way more people if we'd let it spread in the same way other pandemics listed here had.

This article says 3 million lives saved in Europe alone by June due to lockdowns. Which works out that we could have seen 25 million deaths worldwide by June without lockdowns.

There has to be some time for the device to be in place for it to be able to do the work it's intended to.**

&gt;""The damage that's being done is also not instantaneous,"" Gwynn adds. ""So it may take several days before you realize you've damaged your eyes or caused burns on your skin.""

snip

&gt;""UL has made a conscious decision not to certify the consumer-facing, portable, handheld wand-type devices due to the inability to manage the risks,"" Straka tells CNET. 

&gt;""What we would suggest is definitely looking at products that do have a safety certification from a nationally recognized testing laboratory, such as UL,"" Straka adds. ""There are installers and commercial-grade products out there that do have a safety certification and which can be installed and used very safely.""

&gt;One other word of caution here: Beware of products that claim ""EPA certification"" as some form of reassurance about safety or efficacy. EPA certification only signifies that the company making the device has registered with the EPA, and is listed in its database of companies who make products that include an active pesticide. Being listed in that database does not certify that the company's product is safe or effective for use in the home.

&gt;""An EPA establishment number on a pesticide device label identifies the EPA-registered location where the product was produced,"" an EPA spokesperson tells CNET. ""Unlike chemical pesticides, EPA does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices such as UV lights. Therefore EPA cannot confirm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

&gt; So have death rates dropped because of improvements in treatments? Or is it because of the change in who's getting sick? To find out, Horwitz and her colleagues looked at over 5,000 hospitalizations in the NYU Langone Health system between March and August. They adjusted for factors including age and other diseases, like diabetes, to rule out the possibility that the numbers had dropped only because younger, healthier people were getting diagnosed. They found that death rates dropped for all groups, even older patients by 18 percentage points on average. 

[...]

&gt; Doctors around the country say they're doing a lot of things differently in the fight against COVID and treatment is improving. ""In March and April, you got put on a breathing machine and we asked your family if they wanted to enroll you into some different trials we were participating in, and we hoped for the best,"" says Khalilah Gates, a critical care pulmonologist at Northwestern Hospital in Chicago. ""Six plus months into this, we kind of have a rhythm, and so it has become an everyday standard patient for us at this point in time.""

&gt; Doctors have gotten better at quickly recognizing when COVID patients are at risk of experiencing blood clots or debilitating ""cytokine storms,"" where the body's immune system turns on itself, says Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease, critical care and emergency medicine physician who works at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. 

[...]

&gt; But Horwitz and Mateen say that factors outside of doctors' control are also playing a role in driving down mortality. Horwitz believes that mask wearing may actually be helping by reducing the initial dose of virus a person receives, thereby reducing the overall severity of illness for many patients.

&gt; And Mateen says that his data strongly suggest that keeping hospitals below their maximum capacity also helps to increase survival rates. When cases surge and hospitals fill up, ""staff are stretched, mistakes are made, it's no one's fault — it's that the system isn't built to operate near 100%,"" he says.

&gt; For these reasons, Horwitz and Mateen believe that masking and social distancing will continue to play a big role in keeping the mortality rate down, especially as the U.S. and U.K. move into the fall and winter months.",,,1603229744,{},g9h7vfh,False,t3_jez0gr,False,False,t3_jez0gr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jez0gr/studies_point_to_big_drop_in_covid19_death_rates/g9h7vfh/,1603236135,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

First thing is that we have already experienced a lock-down prior to this second wave back in April and May. A superspreader and several other events lead to the lockdown happening in I think late July but by then it was too late and a week later we had 700+ cases and deaths in double digits. I say this because I'll include what measure was included in our first lockdown and second, and what was just our second. 

The second lockdown required the following: 

* Mask wearing was mandated
* A curfew was created where no one was allowed to leave between I think 9 pm and 6 am 
* 5 km movement zone - people could only go 5 km from their home unless it was for work or another legitimate reason (and you had to have a permit) 
* Could only go and buy essential items (food and pharmacy items) once a day, and only one person from each household could go
* You could only exercise outside of your home for 1 hour a day, and with only 1 other person in your household

Our first lockdown also had the following which were brought back:

* You could only leave your home for four reasons: Work or school, care or caregiving, exercise, food or other essential items
* You can't visit other people (friends or family), and you can't socialise outside. 

I think that was it. There's a lot of other items like the fact that other states here have closed their borders to us, and even Regional Victoria and Metropolitan Melbourne have a ""Ring of Steel"" around it, with police preventing people from going between them without a valid permit. 

As for payments - Federally they brought out a payment for those who had been furloughed back in March I think it was. That was about $1,600 per fortnight. It was due to expire in September, but with Melbourne going through what we were, they extended it (other states still had access but I don't think they really needed it since they're all mostly opened up now anyway). Instead, they reduced it to $1,200, but still, at least they were getting something.

Locally, the State Government realised there was a problem with people that didn't have sick leave, or were casually employed. After a few outbreaks in retail, the State Government introduced an immediate payment of I think $200 if people needed to be tested and then isolate. If they were found to be positive, they could then receive a further payment of over $1,000. I can't remember the specifics of that though. People had to prove they had no more leave entitlements to receive it. 

So, yeah. I get a little defensive with some people (maybe they're just the vocal minority) who have a go at the way we've run things here. When I look around the world I see that we avoided something utterly disastrous. We still lost a lot of people unfortunately, but for me the key was making sure the hospitals weren't overrun. I have far too many friends and family in nursing to know what they would have had to go through had it not been for these measures. And people are annoyed with the State Government, blaming them for the second wave (they were in charge of hotel quarantine that resulted in a super-spreader event when security guards and cleaners weren't following proper procedures). I feel it's short-sighted since ultimately it's people who caused the second wave. 

This virus isn't a joke. And I hope that in a few months' time, we can also prove that Melbourne is testament to the idea that by following guidelines and rules that we can prevent the catastrophic effect on the health care systems, let alone the aftermath of this both economically and personally.",,,1603229708,{},g9h7sjf,False,t3_jeia9o,False,True,t1_g9fljtx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jeia9o/coronavirus_victoria_melbourne_makes_world/g9h7sjf/,1603236093,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Facebook, so far. I have 20 ""likes"" on my post, although my best prospect I've already been in contact with. She's a single mother 40 miles away, and works from home. The biggest problem is day care &amp; timing. 

I'll resort to using ""Seeking Arrangements"" as a ""vanilla"" dating site if I have to. 'This place is Tinder to me, just looking for cuties to swing dance with, as well as drink Coronas and play Pandemic.' Yeah, I'm good enough looking to get away with it. That's why it was so easy to talk to strangers at bars, and why I was never declined dances on the social floor (although this is a chance to get really good at dancing, because the 20's may yet be roaring....starting in '22). It's half bored college students, anyway.

I maintain that single people/childless couples putting together pods of folks who are similarly situated is making the best of a bad scenario. Young kids are also fine. School age kids are vectors of transmission. And anyone who lives with someone likely to suffer from this scourge is off limits.

[],,purple_potatoes,,,[],,,,text,t2_4bwkr,False,False,[],"Absolutely! Sorry in advance for the wall of text. Governments and health organizations around the globe are all pushing [similar easy-to-digest precaution PSAs]( https://uihc.org/health-topics/navigating-covid-19-three-cs-and-three-ws). One model is ""The Three C's"" message that describes three types of activities to avoid:

* Closed spaces (ie. close quarters indoors)

* Crowded spaces (close contact with many people)

* Close-contact settings (close-range conversations)

The risk is highest when these factors combine, such as at an indoor party or indoor dining. The lack of masks hugely compounds the risk as well. 

I believe this structure originated in [Japan](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000619576.pdf) but has since been adopted internationally such as by [the WHO](https://www.who.int/images/default-source/wpro/countries/malaysia/infographics/three-3cs/final-avoid-the-3-cs-poster.jpg) and many US cities/states (such as [LA](http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/docs/protection/ReduceRiskInfographic.pdf), [Florida]( https://twitter.com/HealthyFla/status/1275858771944890368/photo/1), and [Hawaii]( https://health.hawaii.gov/news/files/2020/07/Avoid-the-3-Cs-scaled.jpg)).

A similar model is “The Three W’s”, which instead of discouraging particularly risky behaviors instead encourages protective behaviors:

* Wear a mask

* Wash your hands

* Watch your distance

Once again, a party or indoor dining where distancing is poor and masks are not donned greatly increases risk.

This model I believe originated with the [CDC]( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EhFXPvBXcAEb14L?format=png&amp;name=4096x4096) and has been [fairly well-adopted]( https://preventepidemics.org/covid19/science/insights/3-ws-to-reduce-the-risk-of-covid-19/) in the US and to a lesser extent elsewhere.

These messages are of course greatly simplified for easy dissemination and remembering. They are great generalized rules for safety. For slightly more detail, there are charts ranking the risks of certain activities (ex: [1]( https://i.insider.com/5f1afd85f0f4190ad95e38b3?width=1500&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp), [2]( https://covid19.colorado.gov/risks-benefits), [3]( https://www.texmed.org/TexasMedicineDetail.aspx?id=54216), [4]( https://www.nebraskamed.com/sites/default/files/images/covid19/RiskLevelInfographic_062620.jpg)). They all caution against med-large gatherings and indoor dining in particular as being extremely high risk, whereas small distanced outdoor gatherings with mask usage are fairly low risk. [They stress to avoid]( https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6940e2.htm) such activities [as much as possible]( https://www.vox.com/2020/5/22/21266756/coronavirus-pandemic-covid-risks-social-distancing-chart) and to [take ample precautions to minimize risk]( https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/is-it-safe-heres-how-to-weigh-your-coronavirus-risk-as-things-reopen) when participation is unavoidable.

For even more directed recommendations based on the kind of activity, [the CDC has made a page where you can choose an activity and read their mitigation recommendations]( https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/going-out.html). For social gatherings they consistently recommend outdoors or well-ventilated indoor space if outdoors is not possible, heavy mask usage, and ample distancing. Of course, that page is going on the assumption that you have already weighed the risks and decided the activity was appropriate or unavoidable. To weigh the risk of whether the activity should even be attended you can [see their page here]( https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/deciding-to-go-out.html). You’ll note that indoor spaces with many people not wearing masks is what they call a “Hot Spot” for risk, whereas outdoor spaces with distance and masking are dubbed a “Safe Spot”.

Overall, for private social gatherings in particular, risk increases significantly when the event is indoors, larger than just a few people, maskless, long in duration, and/or loud conversation or singing. In general, I feel many people are still being diligent in public settings but the opposite for private settings. Contact with other households is risky. It doesn’t matter if it’s a stranger or a family member. Private social gatherings [have been noted]( https://www.bemidjipioneer.com/newsmd/coronavirus/6640686-Minnesota-health-officials-Informal-gatherings-are-driving-COVID-19-spread) to be [fueling outbreaks]( https://www.oregon.gov/newsroom/Pages/NewsDetail.aspx?newsid=37225) that can [spread beyond the event attendees]( https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/coronavirus-death-toll-maine-wedding-rises-5-over-175-infected-n1240138) and into the wider community. Social gatherings are risky to both the attendees and the community at large, and foregoing simple precautions is throwing fuel on the fire.

It’s all about risk tolerance imo. 

If you have a certain number of folks vaccinated, at some point you reach a threshold where the projected deaths are within society’s risk tolerance. 

That is likely around 100,000 deaths a year for US I think, a fair amount, but not a lot more then the flu.

Once those numbers are at that point, I think ending all restrictions entirely is essential.

I would like to suggest to you that the cause of one spike in one part of the world can be caused by one thing. While another spike in another part of the world can be caused by a different thing.

The recent uptick in Spain and France is caused by reduced social distancing. Perhaps brought on by fatigue (or sometimes this is unkindly called complacency).

The uptick in Chicago is similarly caused by lack of social distancing. Though this time the cause of this lack of social distancing is **a change in behavior** due to the weather. 

It is not that drop in temperature is the cause of the spike. But the drop in temperature drives people inside where there is a lack of social distancing. Which in turn causes the rise in cases.

Stop focusing on the temperature and the cause.

Science is built on falsification so the mark of a good scientist is that they should be actively looking for evidence that disconfirms their hypothesis and trying to craft experiments that reflect that goal. However, you often meet scientists who are the exact opposite and you learn to recognize the signs pretty quickly. They'll have their pet theory and they'll be incredibly confident about the validity of their theory and any disconfirmatory evidence is massaged to still fit without any real change to their worldview. One way you learn to recognize these people is simply by the rate at which they admit they were wrong. Someone who never admits to being wrong once is either a savant who manages to predict the world entirely correctly or a stubborn fool who cares more about their pride than about divining an accurate picture of reality.

It was quite obvious from the start that Tegnell was that kind of scientist, just from the way he spoke about things and how he chose to present his arguments. For example, early on, his estimation of IFR was pretty different from the scientific consensus which is fine, scientists are allowed to have different opinions, but what was telling was that he did not present things by acknowledging that any IFR estimate at the time had intrinsic uncertainty and how Sweden's response would change if the IFR was presumed to be a different number. All of the anti-lockdown contingent of scientists all had IFR figures that were drastically lower than the mainstream and they all presented IFR as if it was this rock solid number that was a key cornerstone to their arguments and, more importantly, only focused on confirmatory studies that suggested their IFR was correct while totally ignoring any evidence that their IFR figures could be totally wrong.",,,1603189106,{},g9f4chs,False,t3_jej2u8,False,True,t1_g9eyo4j,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jej2u8/swedish_virologist_says_her_countrys_covid19/g9f4chs/,1603189117,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

(I really don't understand why anyone would call humans beings for a herd unless to be deliberately condescending, so I prefer just referring to it as the population immunity strategy.) 

After a while the articles started to claim that population immunity was actually the governments *secret* strategy and at that point the government told the head virologist to get a change of ideas before he spoke publicly again. 

That would have been the end of the worst part, if only there had been as many articles warning people to not believe the population immunity hypothesis but instead Denmark had something like a full month of getting spammed by immunity hypothesis, followed by a note in the bottom of a corner section about the government brushing if off.

We can't know things before we're made aware of them.  

Second, people do care about spreading illnesses like the flu. That's why we stay at home when we're sick even though we could technically go to work and might want to. To avoid spreading it to other people.  

Also, we live in a society. We often participate in behaviors because it is the norm. E.g. a lot of people wouldn't start wearing masks until they see others doing it.  

Is that right? Not really. We should act in ways that protect others regardless of social pressure.

But it doesn't matter if people are being hypocritical in some way. We're all hypocrites and illogical at some time or another. Because we're human. 

Because the big picture is the right thing to do is to do what keeps others safe and happy/healthy.  There's no need to get pissy at people for unimportant reasons, when they're doing the right thing.

And yes old people's lives matter. They have the capacity for love, pain, fear, and all the other experiences of living just like the rest of us.  And unfortunately they're often not treated like they do.

You may not give a shit now, but unlike other classes of people that we shit on, one day you will join that class. You'll be old one day and witness the new generation who looks down on older people. And you'll probably start shitting on young people at that point too like many other older folk do.

Younger kid's middle school is now closed for 2 weeks (effective today through Nov 3) because the county deemed they had an outbreak.  The county did not actually tell the district to close the school however(!).  (I'm actually surprised the administration chose to close voluntarily, tbh)

School was open for 5 days without apparent issue.  The following Monday (Columbus Day holiday) we all got an email that there was a positive case at the school.  Then two more of the identical emails by the end of the week.  Last night at the board meeting, turns out those 3 emails applied to 6 people, and 50 total are under quarantine.  They stated that was 10% of the school population (students and teachers), though I do not know from the meeting if that's 10% of the \*total\* population, or 10% of those attending hybrid.  I believe we have \~20% fully remote.  So that 10% might be higher depending how you calculate.

School &amp; Board basically shrugged since ""it's not spreading in the school"" - they're blaming it on the busing.  The buses aren't required to distance the kids, and the buses are run by a joint venture between the elementary district and the HS district, so they seem to think it's of no concern to them.  I very much felt that they were throwing the buses under the bus (sorry).   I don't believe there was a bus rep at the meeting, since no one defended the buses.  

The HS opened a week later than the MS, and has reported 1 case thus far.  They are still holding sports contact days along with classes as per their normal hybrid schedule.  My older kid's HS is still open, however another HS in the district is ""under evaluation"" by the county health dept. due to the number of cases reported there, and the district has closed it for the week effective today (tentatively reopening Oct 26).

[],,mielove,,,[],,,,text,t2_4n4h4,False,False,[],"You're looking at this from a statistics angle where you count cases per capita, ignoring the fact that larger populations means more access-points for virus spread. And it makes zero sense to discount population density as a factor given the way viruses spread. Urbanization = overcrowding, in Sweden's case especially amongst our big immigrant population who are more likely to live as extended multi-generational families under one roof. This is partly financial and partly the result of the housing crises in big cities (especially Stockholm), meaning people who come here usually stay with families if they can.

These are things that are well-known to people who live in Scandinavia. And [20% of Sweden's population is foreign-born](https://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/sverige-i-siffror/manniskorna-i-sverige/utrikes-fodda/) (discounting asylum seekers and illegal immigrants). In 2016 it was [17% in Sweden, 14% in Norway, 11% in Iceland, 10% in Denmark and 6% in Finland](https://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/artiklar/2018/lagre-andel-forvarvsarbetande-bland-utrikes-fodda-i-norden/) (this includes all immigrants though, including high numbers from Scandinavia which isn't really relevant, but that's what more in-depth studies are for). Sweden is well-known for having a much larger population of asylum seekers compared to the rest of the Nordics too, which is a group more at risk for living in overcrowded conditions and multi-generational households.

We know that the hot-spot areas that were hit in Stockholm during the first wave were primarily immigrant-heavy suburbs, you can read about potential infected areas in Stockholm [here](https://www.sll.se/globalassets/1.-halsa-och-vard/bilagor---nyhet/bilagor-nyheter-2020/region-stockholm-rapport-ces-nr-1-om-covid-19-i-stockholms-lan.pdf) (in Swedish - the hardest hit suburbs are shown in table 2 and if you're familiar with Stockholm at all you'll know they're known for housing poorer immigrants). On page 12 they say that after a correction for age/gender people born in Somalia, Syria, Lebanon and Turkey are overrepresented in the data.

I'm not saying immigration differences is for sure the reason for local variation - there are other related phenomenon such as immigrants in these areas tending to be poorer in general and working in jobs they can't stay at home from. I'm saying it's a potential *hypothesis*, just one variable amongst many.

And I've already given you plenty of potential variables - hypotheses - that can explain local variations in spread and why different countries/regions curves look different, but I won't state them as fact since I'm not a researcher from the future who has studied this in depth for years. But it seems like you've decided on one thing (lockdown = good) and are then working backwards to prove this. And that's not how science works. Also what constitutes a ""lockdown"" is very important too, closing down some things might help while closing down other things could be unnecessary or even make things worse.

Incorrect.

They studied this specifically for as many bat species as they could get their hands on cell lines for. And it did not infect any of them.

Of course, there is always the possibility that one of the other myriad of bat species is a host, but it is quite unlikely given that it can infect cats, dogs, ferrets, etc. And humans. Presumably it would be able to infect most bats if it infected some bats. 

So quite clearly some rather strong adaptation to humans occurred. 

Which is one of the multiple lines of evidence that leads many to think it leaked from the Wuhan lab. But it could be a freak event too. In either case, it is almost certainly not circulating in bats right now. 

Many other SARS-type coronaviruses are doing that though, and we will get more pandemics in the future, almost certainly. Especially after we normalized mass death and just throwing our hands in the air with the ""it's too expensive to do anything about it "" excuse.

It has a lot to do with it. You said your body is an even temperature of 98 degrees. Studies indicate that your respiratory tract drops to 87-93 degrees just by breathing in air slightly cooler than room temperature (65-68 fahrenheit), and the cold triggers inflammation which suppresses immune response (De Amato et. al 2018) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6031196/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6031196/)

Another study concludes that for every 3 degree fahrenheit drop in temperature, the risk of infection of a respiratory virus increases by 8% (statistically significant):

""scientific evidence suggests that **inhalation of cold and dry air** lowers the upper airways temperature \[[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5035958/#B12-viruses-08-00244),[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5035958/#B13-viruses-08-00244)\] and **dries the mucosal membrane** and may cause pathophysiological responses \[[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5035958/#B14-viruses-08-00244)\] that contribute to **increase the host susceptibility to viral infections**."" (M Ikaheimo et. al 2016). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5035958/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5035958/)

This finding is also supported by the 2nd link you shared.

Even the link you shared explains that cold weather has a bigger role than warm bodies simply being indoors for warmth.

""At warmer temperatures, however, the protective gel melts to a liquid phase.  But this liquid phase apparently isn’t tough enough to protect the virus against the elements, and so the virus loses its ability to spread from person to person.""

[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080330203401.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080330203401.htm)

I can see why you came to the conclusion, but it seems like you missed the preceding statement.

&gt;**Cooler temperatures**, apparently, cause the virus to form the rubbery outer covering that **can withstand travel from person to person**, Dr. Zimmerberg said.  Once in the respiratory tract, the warm temperature in the body causes the covering to melt to its liquid form, so that the virus can infect the cells of its new host, he added. 

Even the indoor temperature during winter months, as I cited in my first paragraph, 65 degrees is enough to significantly increase your risk of infection. Your 1st link explains that even dry weather has its own component in drying your mucous membranes in your respiratory tract. Now couple that with the physiological ability of cold air to inflame and suppress your immune response in your respiratory tract.

Take a look at your indoor thermostat during summer months while the A/C is running, compared to the indoor thermostat during winter times while the heater is running. The air is still colder during the latter, which scientifically increases your risk of infection.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Cold air impacting the respiratory system has nothing to do with it.

Really, you haven't heard the term state capitalism?  In the 68 commune in Paris this was the #1 most talked about subject.

&gt; I agree with the fact that nature doesn’t submit to human control. It’s a recent “narrative” that we have created. Humans have been for as long as we’ve been around at the mercy of nature, be it droughts, fires, famine, disease.

But it is this dialectic between humans and their environment that makes them special.  All animals adopt to the their environment because they understand that is the best way to survive, blend in, and form harmonious relationships with all other forms of life.  This is the long term balance that maintained steady populations of species for centuries in ""forests"" - vice versa it is the definition of forest, there is no such thing as a temporary forest or a quick growth forest.

Humans on the other hand tries to make nature (their environment) adopt to them.  They build boat so they don't drown, they build dams to block water, channels to irrigate what wasn't naturally, buildings to alter sunlight, humidity, air circulation, temperature, they would rip off thousands of species that were very nutritious and with great potential to be remedies for humans and other lifeforms, and plant the least nutritious junk species to eat and suffer from nutrient deficiencies.  They would even take other life forms and force them to act against their nature, destroy the soil, produce milk and feed other species, use the wrong species to feed other species,... etc.   From making an axe, a hammer, a bow and arrow, to flying above the atmosphere, this has been a dialectic of domination between humans and their environment.  A very destructive and vicious (brief) attack on the ecosystem.  There will still be a balanced ecosystem (very different from what we know) long after humans vanish from the earth, but there will be life without us.  The impact of this parasitic species to all other species, will probably last for thousands of years after our extinction.

But it is the centuries of capitalism that made the parasite explode and dominate every cubic centimeter of the thin life crust of the earth.  A few kilometers above water level and a few more kilometers below the water surface is this thin layer of life.   We have created havoc bringing carbon deposits from deep below and polluted high above the elevation of where any organism can possibly breath.  More carbon, same water, dislocated phosphorus, abundance of other elements and sunshine, and the next life cycle will be even more glorious than this previous one.

The host protease furin cleaves the full-length precursor S glycoprotein into two associated polypeptides: S1 and S2. Cleavage of S generates a polybasic Arg-Arg-Ala-Arg C-terminal sequence on S1, which conforms to a C-end rule (CendR) motif that binds to cell surface Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and Neuropilin-2 (NRP2) receptors. Here, we used X-ray crystallography and biochemical approaches to show that the S1 CendR motif directly bound NRP1. Blocking this interaction using RNAi or selective inhibitors reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry and infectivity in cell culture. NRP1 thus serves as a host factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and may potentially provide a therapeutic target for COVID-19.

* Sampling method: admissions between March 1 and June 20, 2020 in a single health system in New York City 

Link to preprint : https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20172775v1.full.pdf

Authors' summary:
Incremental improvements in outcomes are likely a combination of 
* increasing clinical experience, 
* decreasing hospital volume, 
* growing use of new pharmacologic treatments (such as
corticosteroids, remdesivir and anti-cytokine treatments), non-pharmacologic treatments (such as proning), 
* earlier intervention, 
* community awareness, 
* and lower viral load exposure from increasing
mask wearing and social distancing. 
* It is also possible that earlier periods had a more virulent circulating strain.

My summary:
In March and April, when the hospitals were slammed with the first wave, a lot of people died. At the peak, they admitted 1422 patients in a two-week period in late March and early April).  After that, in late April and May, the curve was flattened to less than 200 patients per two-week period. The staff also had a lot more clinical experience.

I think there are several reasons, on top of my mind and not in order:

* Winter vacation week in Sthlm was one week later than our neighbors (probably the biggest reason for the initial seed, they said that ten percent of the population traveled outside of Sweden spread out over the weeks, the Alps are popular destinations)
* Custom of self-quarantine upon return
* Late with increased and public testing
* The capitol region basically holds half of each of the others countries entire populations
* Dry Tinder-effect
* Softer ""lockdown""
* Slow response
* Idiots :)
* This whole mess with misinterpretation about on-site examinations
* Older population (can't find a source now)
* Stupid super spreader event in Sthlm - Swedish Eurovision
* System failure in the elder care - untrained temps working by the hour without PPE and language barriers, both in care facilities and home care, going from home to home.
* Self-government/decentralized regions when it comes to health care
* No PPE stocks (Hi Finland with like the best preparation in the world)
* Immigrants were the hardest hit, at least in the beginning, which the other countries have few of in comparison. Probably a mixture of bad information from the government, cultural differences like closer contact, more social gatherings and poorer/living several generations in the same household.
* The constitution/Sweden being Sweden.

I didn’t think so.  Your contribution here is a little odd to me like you’re trying to get me to see that this is really a global pandemic of horrific proportions partly because businesses who rely on customers who are 50+ are going to run out of customers.  

This logic makes me worried for you.  

See, for business owners like me (in my county for instance where there’s been 74 deaths all including comorbidities) the fear of “running out of 50+ customers” is way way way down on the list of things making this trying time even more difficult.

Yeah, one of us actually knows economics.  I’m not an expert, but I read about it for fun and took macro and micro in college because I enjoy the subject area.

To quote a Nobel winning economist, we are all Keynesian now.
 
Your derision of Keynes just demonstrates your ignorance or ideologue nature, like a creationist shitting in Darwin.

You could be an acolyte of Austrian economics and this not ignorant so much as misinformed.

&gt; In a very short timeframe you can cheat with fiat, but its already been 9 months and we haven't even felt the bulk of the economic impacts yet.

Then I guess very short time frames are longer than 9 months.  

&gt; EU nations have a lot more say in it than US states though, and you end up with the financially more stable countries trying to block debt meant to help the harder off countries.

Indeed, that was the weirdness that I referred to.  EU countries can run out of currency in a way that the US literally can’t as we control the supply of what our debt is enumerated in.  In such cases, you can’t run out u in f money.

It can of course become near valueless like Zimbabwe or the Weimar Republic that goldbugs love to invoke.


&gt;Yes, endlessly. I'm not saying we will literally be going in and out of lockdowns until the end of time, but we don't have a timeline for the end and don't know what that will look like.

[],,jclar_,,,[],,,,text,t2_12f5jw,False,False,[],"Check out the worldometers website. They've got a chart for the US that has lots of different helpful numbers for comparison, as well as a chart for all the countries. Vermont has had 3,119 cases/million and 93 deaths/million. That's about as good as it gets for the US, but New Zealand has had 377cases/mil and 5 deaths/mil. If you were in NZ you'd be safe, but *you're still in the US*. Vermont is also relatively low on the tests per million population, which would indicate that there are likely many more missed cases than some other states. Your state gov also probably has a website detailing the cases in each county, so your specific area might have more or less cases than the state average per capita. People will also be travelling soon for the holidays, increasing cases all over the country.

If you hang outside with masks on, then you should be totally fine. Masks have proven to be effective, and ventilation has been proven to be effective. Just only go inside to use the restroom, and make sure people keep their masks on for that as well, and you'll be safe. If you know that those friends aren't engaging in avoidable risky behaviors like going to restaurants and parties or not wearing masks while close to others, then you'll be okay. Generally, if people wear masks and avoid long-term indoor activities, they won't get it. And if they don't get it, then you're not going to get it from them. IF they do get it, AND are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic when you see them, then wearing masks and hanging outside is likely still safer than going to the grocery store. Also get your flu shots and make sure everyone you see also gets them.

I think she needs to assess what she means by ""living her life"". How much social activity does she need to thrive? What other out-of-home activities does she feel she needs? Are there risk factors for either of you, would either of you be likely to bring the virus to work and infect an overweight or over 50 coworker? What is the cutoff of local infections that would make her feel unsafe? Why is it that number and not another? If kids are going back to school in your area, there's likely about to be an increase in cases if it hasn't already happened.

I'm not trying to argue either way too much, but how long will you be able to stay home before your own mental state is affected? Can the two of you find a compromise and do zoom calls with friends and family? Online board games can be pretty fun as well. Is there one friend or couple who you can guarantee that you're each other's only outside interaction? Would she and they be willing to make a pact to only see each other? Still outside and with masks of course, but it would be your safest bet at social time without increasing risk. NZ and Vietnam have done extremely well with minimal lockdowns and maximum mask-wearing. If you can get a couple higher quality masks (KN95s are available and inexpensive), you can increase the safety for the individual interactions. 

It's up to the two of you to take the information that's available and decide where you can come to an agreement, because everyone's needs are different and your mental health and relationship have some weight as well. Can you be clear with her that more than zero risk feels like too much for you, and ask that the two of you work together (and it really has to be a good effort from both of you) to find ways that satisfy her needs while also keeping to your own comfort level, and find an end date that you can re-evaluate how you're both doing and restructure how you behave?

I don't think mask-wearers are limited to ""lockdown until it's over"" or ""back to normal but with masks"". I think most people are in between the two, unless they're particularly high risk, and I think your girlfriend is on the more conservative side as well based on what you've said, which is good. My boyfriend was very affected by the initial ""lockdown"", he relies on frequent exercise and social activity to thrive. We were working out from home and doing zoom calls with friends. But he was definitely still suffering. But we've been climbing outside every couple weeks with a few specific people now and we've been okay (CO has dealt with it pretty well). I'm worried about the winter, since he'll be wanting to see people but being outside will suck, but he's been receptive to my needs as well, so we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. I'm an DIY-loving introvert so I could definitely hunker down for a year or two with my knitting with minimal adverse affects, and I absolutely don't want to get COVID, so I reel him in so things don't get too risky, but I'm still making sure he stays sane because we're both fit, healthy, and upper 20s. Absolute wall of text, but just wanted to share some real options (rather than just stats) that might satisfy both of you. Neither of you is wrong in how you feel, you just have different perceptions of what the risks are, and what is acceptable risk, and nearly every couple and roommates in the country and all over the world have had at least some tension about how to collectively respond to the situation, and plenty of people have found out that their partner doesn't do well at all in adversity and that it's not worth it to stay with them.

If this is effective to reduce the necessary percentage to obtain herd immunity then the other piece of the puzzle is to help elimimate those most at risk from the transmission chain. What age groups and what are the cutoffs? Should all people between 5-65 be considered part of this group? 5-50? 18-65? If we eliminate part of this population can we add some other partd of society or events back in? These are valid questions and part of what could have made a herd immunity strategy effective.

But nm, we'll just keep doing whatever it is we've been doing for the last 7 months. Lockdowns aren't appropriate for a long time period(or a second time) because we need an economy to survive and this virus is not dangerous enough to convince everyone to stay home of their own accord. Not doing anything also doesn't work because we haven't reduced our afforementioned reduced Herd Immunity threshold.

To point 3 specifically in the points you copied(i realize it's old stats and the current positive total is 110,000) By utilizing the current IFR of ~0.5, we can estimate Mississippi has had ~600,000 cases of Covid, or 21% of the population.

Madrid - 20 OCT 2020 - 10:35 CEST

Spain is nearing the milestone of one million confirmed coronavirus infections, and on Monday registered a new record high number of cases reported in a single day. On Monday – no data is supplied over the weekend – the Health Ministry communicated 37,889 cases, the highest number seen in one of its daily reports. Before yesterday, the peaks in the data had been seen on the last two Mondays of September, with around 31,000 cases. Since the start of the pandemic, a total of 974,449 coronavirus cases have been detected in Spain.

The 14-day cumulative number of coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants also came in at a record high on Monday, at 312. There are, however, large differences between the regions when it comes to this indicator. The regions that exceed the 500-case barrier are Navarre (945 cases), Melilla (713), La Rioja (531) and Aragón (509). This data point is one of the three criteria currently being used by the central government and the regions as triggers for stricter measures to be implemented, including perimetral confinements and social limits (the other two are the positivity rates of PCR tests and occupation levels of intensive care unit (ICU) beds). Only the Canary Islands, with 77 cases, is currently under the 100 level.

&gt;The health system continues to be under pressure and patient numbers are rising

FERNANDO SIMÓN, DIRECTOR OF THE HEALTH MINISTRY’S COORDINATION CENTER FOR HEALTH ALERTS

This record number of infections in a day is a “bad sign,” according to Ildefonso Hernández, the spokesperson for the Spanish Public Health Society (Sespas). But he qualified his view: “Let’s see what happens over the next few days. The European trend is going sharply upward and several of the large countries, such as the United Kingdom and France, are already surpassing us.” In Spain, he continued, the cases are rising, but “there are some regions that are low and are moving toward holding steady, while Madrid is also holding steady. What Catalonia does in the coming days, along with Madrid and Andalusia, will determine the general trend.” And he warned: “This virus is really difficult; there are still a lot of people who are susceptible and it will continue to spread.”

Pedro Gullón, a member of the Spanish Society of Epidemiology, pointed out that Spain has, for some time, had very high incidence and has been in a phase of rises and falls. The current wave, he added, appears to be “more consistent over time” and that “we will no doubt see more rises and falls with a lot of territorial differences.” He explained: “It appears that we reach a maximum but then cases do not fall; we go from a plateau with some rises and falls; now there is a rise.”

Fernando Simón, director of the Health Ministry’s Coordination Center for Health Alerts (CCAES), said on Monday night when he presented the latest data, that Spain is not progressing “as well as we would like.” Last week the government’s chief epidemiologist was talking about a stabilization of the pandemic in Spain. But yesterday he called the incidence “very high” and said that there is “a small rising trend,” similar to that being registered in the rest of Europe.

However, Simón underscored that the rise in cases in Spain has been slow and progressive, while the dynamic in other countries has been the multiplication of cases by a factor of two or three in a question of just two weeks. “I would like to think that we will go slower,” he said, taking for granted that infections will continue to grow. “It is to be expected that we will have a rise in incidence in the winter, if we don’t take into account the prevention measures.”

The daily report from the Health Ministry also added a further 217 victims to the official death toll, which now stands at 33,992. However, this does not include the thousands of fatalities during the first wave in spring, where no test had been carried out. According to the latest data from the National Statistics Institute (INE), the number of excess deaths in Spain since March is around 59,000 – i.e. there have been 59,000 more deaths this year than were expected compared to previous years. The number of Covid-19-related deaths according to Monday’s report detected over the last seven days is 459.

The occupation of ICU beds has also risen since the last report, which was released on Friday. One in every four ICU beds (21%) is now occupied by a coronavirus patient, again with major differences from region to region. In Ceuta, Melilla, Madrid, Aragón and La Rioja, the occupancy rate is around 40%. Castilla y León, meanwhile, comes in at 36%. In hospitals, one in every 10 ward beds (10.36%) is occupied by a Covid-19 patient across the country. Madrid and the North African city of Melilla exceed 20%. In total, there are 12,945 coronavirus patients receiving hospital treatment.

According to Monday’s report, 459 Covid-19 related deaths were detected over the last seven days
Fernando Simón also expressed concern about these hospital figures. While they have not risen rapidly, they mean “the health system continues to be under pressure and [patient numbers] are rising, with the problems that this can mean.” The CCAES director explained that the age range for which the biggest rise in incidence has been detected is 10 to 19, and he pointed to the high detection level of positive cases, with 40 to 45% of cases asymptomatic. The fatality rate continues to fall, he added, and is currently at 3.5%, compared to the 12.3% seen at the start of the pandemic.

“We are all very tired now,” said Simón, in reference to the restrictions that a number of regions have had in place for months. He also called for individual responsibility, and for citizens to comply with the rules “with even greater care” now that winter is approaching. This, he said, would “avoid other, more restrictive [measures] that would have a bigger social and economic impact.”

The cold weather, epidemiologist Pedro Gullón explained, “could see us take more activities indoors, where there is a greater risk, apart from also increasing the number of cases of similar seasonal diseases, such as the flu and other winter respiratory viruses, which could overwhelm the primary care system and laboratories even more because they share symptoms with Covid.”

As for the Madrid region, which had once again become the epicenter of the health crisis in Spain, Simón said that the progress is positive. The impact of the measures implemented in recent weeks – involving a perimetral confinement of nine municipalities, including the Spanish capital – had been “clearly beneficial,” he said. “We will have to see how things progress from here onward because this is not over,” he added. “Despite its progress being relatively good, Madrid still registered 439 cumulative cases per 100,000 inhabitants over 14 days, and that is a very high incidence,” he concluded.

Simón also explained on Monday that experts from the Madrid regional government and the Health Ministry are already working on a scenario once the state of alarm implemented by the central administration is lifted on Saturday, and for which there are no plans to extend. But, he added, “the politicians will have the last word.” There has been an ongoing battle in recent months between the government and the Madrid regional administration about how to tackle rising infection rates in the area, with the former calling for more widespread measures and the latter resisting for fears over the damage they would do to the economy. Simón pointed to the fact that the latest data showed that of the nine municipalities that have had perimetral lockdowns, seven are now “clearly below 500” cases per 100,000 inhabitants over 14 days, and “five of them are below 400.”

On Wednesday, regional chiefs will meet with the Health Ministry in order to study a new draft of an early response system that will be implemented when cases rise in an area of Spain, and will determine which measures should be taken according to a range of epidemiological criteria.",,,1603187583,{},g9f2z4c,True,t3_jemd9p,False,True,t3_jemd9p,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jemd9p/spain_reports_record_38000_coronavirus_cases_in_a/g9f2z4c/,1603187857,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Why so much armchair quarterbacking?  And why so many “fairy tale”type rhetorical threads about how “this is a buffoon politician’s doing and if only if only someone from the other side was president none of this would have happened.”

It’s so old honestly no matter what your political slant is.

The “truth” you’re told relies solely on two factors...  Where you look for it and what your party’s current approved narrative is.  

That’s what’s dangerous, NOT THE FUMBLINGS OF THESE BUFFOONS!  I don’t care what side you’re for but governing politicians that wear your team’s logo made just as many mistakes as the other team, so shouting about how they suck not only solves nothing but devolves the conversation.  

It’s almost like, there’s a team rooting for COVID to win so their perspective is reinforced.  

I see it with sports fans all the time.  Punching on each other in stadium parking lots instead of walking together, interested in the others’ perspectives.  

No.  We just yell “your team sucks” and ask each other constantly in our respective broods “nobody likes that team right?  Because they are idiots right?  We know best right?”  

Jesus no wonder nothing gets done.  

A bunch of us going around screaming “I’m helping” with their middle fingers up at anyone with an opposing political perspective is not helping.  

Context erodes immediately in the face of facts that threaten your narrative.  Whatever your narrative is.  Why?  Why can’t you keep context and still hold your political beliefs.  It’s like saying “New England Patriots suck” because they are doing better than the team you like.  

IT IS NOT HELPING.  

Ever stop to think for a minute that because COVID seems to be downstream from politics that all your COVID information is awash with your party’s approved messaging??

It’s the reason why we are paralyzed.  We can’t find common ground.  Why?  

It means if you do put in the work to find common ground that “you’re ok working with a with a racist nazi” Or “you’re ok working with an old man with late stage dementia” and since these juicy chunks of sensational nonsense are all fueling the campaign efforts of politicians then we are just used as an audience.  

Don’t believe me?  Watch this...  

1.3 million people die each year in automobile fatalities that are completely beyond their control and these gruesome fatalities have never been used in a campaign to reduce the amount of time we spend behind the wheel.  Or to reinforce driver safety by mandating testing for awareness or reflexes.  We’ve never required mandatory vehicle safety inspections to make sure they are compliant.  In fact it doesn’t even get mentioned.  Not a peep.  Something completely within our control.  Deaths - orders of magnitude - more gruesome and tragic than an escalating flu that has a survivability rate of 99.9% for anyone under 50.  

This matters, but you’ve finished reading it and it’s already gone from your mind because it is of no utility to you in pointing out that another team sucks right?  So that inconvenient context can be ignored let’s move on...

This hysteria is real.  You can live with your head firmly rooted in the sands of your political party’s battle cry to help carry out their crusade whatever the f*ck that means or you can seek to find common ground with people to dwell somewhere in the zone of common sense, courtesy and decency without a single political figure giving you that direction.

If you’re brave, peek behind the curtain of the opposing political party’s messaging.  You’ll see that the vast majority of hospitals in your county have nobody in them, and have not had any remarkable change in operation at all.  

Yes these stories of the “bad” exist but watching you get used like pawns to hate others because of these stories is what all of us should be most afraid of.  

Find common ground with those around you.

&gt;I think it's deeper than that. Democracies do not judge leaders on objective performance, they judge on perceived performance and [it's well known](https://workchronicles.com/prevention-and-cure/) that heroically fixing a problem showers you in glory but preventing the problem only brings you disdain.

Oh please. This constant poo pooing of democracies is really getting old. 

First of all South Korea, Japan and Taiwan are fully functioning liberal democracies. Just like the western democracies. 

Second, western democracies has no problem making sacrifices in the first and second world wars. They made way more sacrifices then they ever did today. 

Third China, a country which is most definitely not a democracy, also played the perception game. China covered up the virus for a long time.

There are plenty signs the virus likely emerged sometime in [August](https://beta.ctvnews.ca/national/coronavirus/2020/6/9/1_4975822.html) and China was aware of it but covered it up until November when it became to difficult to ignore. Then claimed it came out of nowhere. 

Fourth what we are seeing in Western countries, more specifically in the United States, is a cultural (not political) trend which emerged in the 1960s against authority. It emerged intially as the hippie movement and the civil rights movement but has evolved into something else. 

Western Society had gone through this before in the 1920s and many other times. Usually a [crisis will bring back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_generational_theory?wprov=sfla1) society into a more conformist direction and eventually that will breakdown as the conformity becomes oppressive toward a class of people.",,,1603208124,{},g9fwrzh,False,t3_jej2u8,False,True,t1_g9ewm5g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jej2u8/swedish_virologist_says_her_countrys_covid19/g9fwrzh/,1603208806,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Allow me to give you a personal reflection. As a Swede, I thought the initial response was way too lax from the Swedish equivalent of the CDC, called FHM. Why not close everything down? Pull out the hazmat suits? Weld the doors to buildings that have infections? I’m only half joining.  

I was thinking that this was something that could be fought off in a couple of months through really hard restrictions and lockdowns. I was super critical to how it was handled here. 

As time passed, I have learned to appreciate the time scale we are operating at. FHM has said all along that this is a marathon, and not a sprint. But if someone told me in March that we would have restrictions and recommendations for over a year, I would have told them that they were exaggerating and a doomsday person. A lot. 

Not so anymore. 

The long term view and sustainability of any recommendations and restrictions is key. I doesn’t matter much if you have a hard lockdown during the first three months and then open everything up. The virus will find you eventually. Better then to have measures that flatten the curve rather than try to eradicate the virus. Better to have measures that people will accept for a couple of years, rather than for a few months. It’s a classic optimisation game really...

But now to the really interesting part. The “lax” recommendations and restrictions really made me treat the virus with more respect than I would have had with harsher measures. Thinking that the FHM downplayed the crisis made me buy face masks, hand sanitizer, protective goggles, and even a couple of hazmat’ish suits. I kept the kids out of school and worked 100% from home. Didn’t see friends or family. 

If there had been a hard lockdown for a month or two with fines, no outdoor exercise and police on the street, I would probably not be as careful as I am today, almost 8 months into this thing.

I don't think an academic pediatrician is going to know how to find data discrepancies between vendor data transmissions and source documentation. Nor is that pediatrician going to understand good manufacturing practices to see that the vaccines were manufactured properly and review their shipment logs for temperature excursion issues. Is that pediatrician well versed in the code of federal regulations that regulate human experimentation?

Sure, you get discounts of like 5% here or there from certain companies, but my family doesn’t bring it up nor do my girlfriends/friends. Personally, I would rather forget about most of it myself, but my point is that you are told that it means so much to employers and people in general that you served; but it’s only really to make them feel better about themselves.

At least, that’s how I always figured it. Like, when someone saluted me or came up to me it was more about them feeling good about themselves to be patriotic. But that’s about as far as any meeting or relationship with anyone has gone based around my time in the service. It’s a distant memory that impacts my life very little for the good, even if I try and use my experience to better my life (get a job for instance).

I often hear college grads say that their diploma feels worthless because they can’t get decent paying jobs. Well, that’s exactly how I feel.

The government isn’t controling the economy. Most lockdowns ended months ago. There has been an economic contraction because there is a lack of consumer demand because consumers don’t feel safe, and they shouldn’t.

States re-opened the theaters in August only to have the theaters closed voluntarily again because people weren’t going to see movies. There was a lack of demand for their product.

Then you should support measures to get the pandemic under control. Just ignoring it is only going to prolong the health crisis, which will prolong the economic crisis.

The challenge trials might give us some interesting data on disease course (in young, healthy people), but we already have plenty of cases from contact tracing for whom we know the date of exposure and disease course.

I don’t see how that extra data from the challenge trial would speed the vaccine approval process, given that all of the efficacy data would still be available long before the necessary follow-up period for vaccine safety and durability.

E: Part of the reason that current Phase 3 trials are focusing on symptoms is that they’re primarily focused on preventing COVID (the disease) rather than infection.  Given how coronaviruses work, there’s good reason to suspect that vaccines won’t prevent infection but will protect against disease.

You may not personally care, be at risk, or have been affected - but it is a remarkably callous and Malthusian way of understanding our present situation. High rates of infections combined with even low fatality rates is certain death for many people (220k so far in the US, to be exact). This does not even begin to address non-death related harm from the disease. You can hem and haw about how I am misinformed (I work in medicine, fyi), but I think you just don’t care about other humans dying. 

Here’s a news report about the overwhelmed state of hospitals current in the Midwest (the story is 4 days old as of my post): https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/16/pandemic-states-virus-rebound-429753

Here’s some excerpts:

* “Our hospitals are getting overwhelmed,” Republican Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said this week. “The dramatic increase in infections has put the integrity of our health care system at risk.“

* The University of Utah Health System, one of the largest hospitals in the state, reported its ICU is 95 percent filled, and health systems in other parts of the country have been forced to relocate patients because of bed and staffing shortages.

* In Indiana, the state is facing “critical ICU bed shortages along with personnel shortages” according to Chief Medical Officer Lindsay Weaver, only three weeks after Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb removed most Covid-related restrictions. Officials have put out a call for volunteers to help fill staffing shortages in hard-hit facilities near the Michigan and Kentucky borders.

And so on. Again, *you* might not care about the frontline medical workers who are being driven towards literal PTSD, but others do (as they selfishly should, do you want a doctor who is on verge of a mental breakdown?). Do you think hospitals that nearing 95% capacity are as effective as those at 50%? If you need to go to the ER, COVID or otherwise, which hospital are you going to prefer? 

Like honestly, what is you argument here? It’s better that these people die than you are economically disadvantaged? 

Like, we’ve come to terms in an earlier point that we need safety nets to mitigate more damage caused by quarantine-like measures, but that doesn’t absolve you from *not killing your fellow man*.",,,1603216257,{},g9gdhop,False,t3_jem73q,False,True,t1_g9g7d3o,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jem73q/younger_people_now_68_of_la_countys_new/g9gdhop/,1603218880,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Summary:

There will be mass testing of everyone in Slovakia using rapid antigen tests. It will not be compulsory, but upon testing, you will receive an official confirmation - anyone found in the public without such confirmation in the next ten days will be fined. So it essentially imposes a 10-day quarantine on anyone not willing to take part - so that people who don't go outside anyway don't have to get tested. Children below the age of 10 are exempt as well. 

20000 medical personal will be needed, med students are encouraged to help. Army will organize the effort with 5000 testing locations, it will happen on Oct 30/Nov 1 and Nov 6-8. Swipe from deep in the nose, then 15-20 minutes wait for results on the spot. Pilot project this week 23-25 Oct in some chosen areas to test feasibility. You will get a date based on the first latter of your surname.

Yes. That's a very good \*hypothesis\*.  The thing about science is you take a hypothesis and test it. And that's easy for some things, and harder for others.

For this particular hypothesis it's extremely difficult to measure the effect, because there are so many parameters you can't control for (even things like the weather could affect your control period).

So the reason this doesn't have very strong scientific results yet, isn't because it's a bad hypothesis, it's just because it's really really hard to test.

SE is much more inequal, economically and socially, leading to a bit of segregation. Guess where they had a very high mortality. Yep, where the information of the govt did not reach well, including the ""infamous"" suburbs.  
The health and care system, while ""free"" is also very privatised and honestly underfunded. A lot of deaths in the nursing homes, and a lot of failure there.  
NO and DK are much more centrally governed from Oslo and Copenhagen that can easily dictate rules, while Sweden has a lot of competence with the local ""regions"".  
Historically FI and NO have a different relationship to national tragedies during 2nd World War, while SE has the luck of being relatively untouched by calamities (Estonia was one, but of very different kind), therefore the preparedness was much worse  in SE - see the lack of an emergency law for calamities (that are not war) or em. FI had, due to historical preparedness, much better emergency storages when the crisis came, while SE had to utilise old and non-certified gas masks of Försvarsmakten.

SE is more integrated in the European continent than FI or NO economically, due to proximity and traffic-wise, and even politically (NO not being part of EU) - being an advocate of open borders .",,,1603193577,{},g9f8une,False,t3_jekiu1,False,True,t1_g9f5szu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jekiu1/swedens_anders_tegnell_we_did_not_pursue_herd/g9f8une/,1603193587,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Contrast that with hanging around friends and family who you aren’t typically exposed to, with whom you’re likely spending hours in close proximity and probably eating which makes mask wearing impossible. Eating around a Thanksgiving table, hanging out in the living room watching sports on TV (possibly involving shouting depending on company) etc. are high risk activities. If one person in that group has Covid, and particularly if they are among the subset of people more likely to spread the virus, now everybody in that room is at significant risk.

Im not a conspiracy theorist but i do trade stocks and one thing i know from experience is that there is an indicator that shows if more people are buying or selling. when the most people are buying it tells me to think about selling because historically when everyone thinks its going up it usually goes down and vice versa. Whenever we are overbought and ready to go down.. MOST PEOPLE ARE BUYING... Bad news *somehow* very conveniently comes out send the markets down then everybody starts selling and when theres a ton of selling the opposite happens.

1. Majority/the masses is not the team you want to be on... you need to be at least a little bit skeptical because when everyone BELIEVES stocks will go up they go down and vice versa and this is with everything in life too because thats the reason why very fee succeed in life.. be a part of the few not the many

AstraZeneca’s large, late-stage U.S. trial has been on hold since Sept. 6, after a participant in the company’s UK trial fell ill with what was suspected to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.

The sources, who were briefed on the matter but asked to remain anonymous, said they have been told the trial could resume later this week. It was unclear how the FDA would characterize the illness, they said.

An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment.

The agency is requiring researchers conducting the trial to add information about the incident to consent forms signed by study participants, according to one of the sources.

UK regulatory officials previously reviewed the illness and determined there was “insufficient evidence to say for certain” that it was or was not related to the vaccine. It permitted the trial to resume enrolling participants in the UK, according to a draft of the updated consent form shared with Reuters.

“In this case, after considering the information, the independent reviewers and MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) recommended that vaccinations should continue,” the draft consent form stated. “Close monitoring of the affected individual and other participants will be continued.”

Regulators in Brazil, India and South Africa also previously allowed AstraZeneca to resume its vaccine trials there.

AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine with Oxford University researchers, had been seen as a frontrunner in the race to produce a vaccine for COVID-19 until its trials were put on hold to investigate the illness. Early data from large-scale trials in the United States of vaccines from Pfizer Inc PFE.N and Moderna Inc MRNA.O are expected some time next month.

Vaccines are seen as essential to helping end the pandemic that has battered economies around the world and claimed more than 1 million lives - over 220,000 of them in the United States.

Responding to a request, British regulators shared with Reuters a draft of a form letter to UK vaccine trial participants, dated Oct. 14 and signed by the Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Team. It says the U.S. FDA had “completed their analysis” and said vaccination in the United States would resume shortly.

FDA “has come to the same conclusion as the other drug regulators including the MHRA,” the letter states.

The Health Research Authority, which helps regulate UK medical research, did not say if the letter had been sent or immediately respond to questions about it.

An AstraZeneca spokeswoman said the communication is not from the company and it “cannot verify the content,” referring to the draft letter to study participants.

“We also cannot comment on a pending FDA decision,” she said.

**NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE**

In another of the documents directed at trial participants, the Oxford vaccine study team noted that there was not enough evidence to link the neurological problem seen in the UK trial to the vaccine.

Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who reviewed the document, said it can be difficult to link a rare side effect specifically to a vaccine to the exclusion of other potential causes.

Transverse myelitis, which the study volunteer is believed to have developed, typically occurs at a rate of 1-in-200,000 people, Offit said, so it would be unusual to see it in a trial of 9,000 individuals.

Other viruses including those that cause West Nile and polio can trigger the condition, as can physical trauma.

The regulators have to weigh whether a rare side effect is vaccine-related and could occur again against the sickness and deaths linked with COVID-19, Offit said. “That’s always the line that you walk.”",,,1603219763,{},g9gktt3,True,t3_jevvy7,False,True,t3_jevvy7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jevvy7/exclusive_astrazeneca_us_covid19_vaccine_trial/g9gktt3/,1603223277,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

[],,jackp0t789,,,[],,,,text,t2_epakr,False,False,[],"&gt; Spanish flu, how much would the increased population and density vs better handling of respiratory infections play out? 

We've seen how it would play out since we've had several moderate influenza pandemics since then. Turns out that flu vaccines, anti-inflammatories and other drugs that lower fevers and prevent cytokine storms have been a game changer.

&gt; suppose smallpox was a novel virus in 2020. How many before a vaccine was created. 

Ok, if Smallpox was a novel virus today but still had the same characteristics of smallpox when it was still around, it would be much better controlled and monitored, which would help isolate the infectious and prevent widespread transmission outside of the developing world, where it will still be a problem, much like TB still is today.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The Plague? Yeah the hygiene and knowledge of antibiotics make that something that would probably be pretty well handled in rich countries, but it wouldn't be that way across the globe. 

&amp;#x200B;

You know the plague still exists right? There are a couple cases that pop up in the US every year since the bacteria Y. Pestis is endemic in rodent populations in the southwest. Even in less developed regions, save for a few notable outbreaks recently in Madagascar and other parts of Africa, it is still far less deadly and has virtually no pandemic potential because of how treatable it is with modern antibiotics. If Yersinia Pestis mutates and becomes antibiotic resistant much like several strains of TB have recently, that's another story, but we're talking about the word as it is today, not a world where those bacterial infections have already evolved immunity towards antibiotics.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; You can't count vaccines because those exists due to the disease being in existence, and it would take time to develop one, same as with covid. 

Yeah, which is why we have yearly flu vaccines that confer immunity to the most dominant and most commonly spread strains of influenza viruses in any given flu season.

[],,ClinicalOperations,,,[],,,,text,t2_h8fmv0s,False,False,[],"Regulatory review is a very specific process and skill set and has nothing to do with practicing medicine. You can't plop a bunch of academic doctors and expect them to know how to AUDIT data at the level of the FDA. They may have experience in MEDICAL review but they have no experience in REGULATORY review. There is more to a BLA submission than just the actual safety and efficacy results. 

Would you have project managers doing code reviews because you don't trust your developers? Or would you get independent developers to do code review?

Most doctors do not understand GCP, GLP, GMP, GDP, etc. unless they have a ton of industry experience or experience running clinical trials.

How can they tell the FDA isn't doing their job if they have zero experience or knowledge in the actual FDA review process? Have they ever looked at final CSR before? How well versed are they in the code of federal regulations for human experimentation? What does being a doctor have to do with reviewing cold chain of custody temperature logs for vaccine shipments? Do these doctors know how to review an electronic trial master file? 

Did you know the FDA conducts inspections at the pharma /biotech companies, vendors used on the trials, drug depots, randomly selected sites running the trials to make sure that data sources can be trusted? Is this safety review group going to do that or just look at a journal article and rubber stamp it if it's statistically sound?

I should state that I'm not against reviewing the FDA and ensuring they are accountable. I would like the FDA to be held accountable for their reviews. The intentions are good but the execution is poor.

I would recommend two options. 

1. If you're going to run a secondary review, have actual independent inspectors do the job. There are former FDA inspectors out there who know how to find issues with clinical trial design, documentation, data issues, etc. Hire them for the safety review group. These guys are regulatory professionals and often doctors as well. They know what issues with trial design or operations to look out for. 

2. The second option I would recommend is hire an external independent team to audit the FDA to ensure they are following their processes and not bullshit approving things based on political pressure. There's no point in reinventing the wheel with a bunch of amateurs who've never done something like this before when we just need to make sure the people are doing their damn job.

How do you think Tony ended up as governor? The state is on a political knife's edge and you're extrapolating from your experiences living near Kenosha County to the whole fucking state. I'm from Milwaukee. 

We didn't hate the governor. We voted for him. We didn't fight in court for seven months. We supported the public health mandates being attacked. We still care and are accustomed to following the law. We aren't toting guns getting irrationally angry at the suggestion to wear a mask. Hell, we're probably more testy about people not wearing masks. This plurality of people I'm speaking of may not be as dispersed throughout the state, so maybe you don't encounter us near the Illinois/Wisconsin border as much. But we're here. Are we a majority? Well, judging by the 2018 gubernatorial election we are not. But the opposition isn't a majority here either. 

You're letting the idiots define the state because they're loud and arrogant. That's what they want. 

Wisconsin is not a shithole state. It's fighting still against becoming one. We've been fighting an uphill battle against it becoming one for ten years. People like you in Illinois can say the struggle is over and it's easy to do so. What does it matter to you? The view from Milwaukee is that it's not over and people like you on the outside don't get to call gameover. Perhaps if the GOP can win seats to get a veto-proof majority going into the redistricting negotiations, I will hang in the towel. Right now, we've got someone in Tony Evers that will bring parity back to our redistricting and make it more obvious whose voices are more numerous in this state.

“This pandemic has already caused the biggest global education emergency in history, and the increase in poverty will make it very hard for the most vulnerable children and their families to make up for the loss”, said Inger Ashing, CEO of Save the Children.

We cannot afford to let a whole generation of children become victims of this pandemic. National governments and the international community must step up to soften the blow.”

Population density hasn't been shown to significantly affect how magnitude of the pandemic, just fyi.

&gt;has a far greater foreign-born population than other Scandinavian countries (a known risk group, that is vastly overrepresented in cases in all these countries).

Source?

&gt;Not to mention the fact that Swedish holidays in 2020 predated the ones in other Scandinavian countries, meaning Sweden likely got a greater spread of the virus to begin with.

All of them had their spikes at the same period, just fyi. If you look at the curves, Finland and Norway got theirs flattened early on because of the lockdown. No idea why you're ignoring the lockdown as the biggest difference here.

&gt;so a higher death rate amongst the elderly in 2020 was expected.

You can't really say it's expected if measures to protect the elderly weren't taken early on, just fyi.

&gt;It's unscientific, and is basically just picking and choosing the most basic data to confirm your own biases

Yeah, let's just ignore that not locking down meant that Sweden had a prolonged surge compared to countries that did. It's almost as though the data is there to corroborate that.

And here's the fivethirtyeight article I got the link from:

https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/without-a-vaccine-herd-immunity-wont-save-us/

&gt;In one oft-cited study, for example, people were given a dose of a cold-causing coronavirus, got sick and recovered, then were given another dose a year later. Most of the patients got reinfected, showing how quickly their immunity waned. (And most of them didn’t get sick, which opens up a whole new barrel of fun: If COVID-19 works the same way, some people who had the disease and recovered could wind up picking up — and spreading — the novel coronavirus again despite not being symptomatic.)

2)  
&gt;30 reinfections from 40 million cases, not really a concern

That's not correct.  We don't sequence for strain for the vast majority of people. So it's not out of 30 million cases, it's out of a MUCH smaller number.  And even then, reinfection with the same strain doesn't count as proof.  

Here's what you are basically saying:  out of all the people who have died traveling, only 19 have died going to space and back.  Therefore, space travel is the safest way to travel. 

Do you see the problem?

Totally, sadly it has been confusion and inconsistencies in advice from the start.

The understanding is that any face covering reduces the amount of transmission.

Therefore for your normal person attending a store or on transport might be exposed to some particles via their eyes but the mask still prevents the majority form entering a more effective entry point.   

Assuming the viral load theory is correct you could be exposed to a smaller amount and not contract the virus.

A good confirmation of the mask efficacy, is the 2 American Hairdressers who were CV19+, but cut some 140 peoples hair.  

Customer and workers both were wearing masks and not one customer got it.

A six week period of Level 5 restrictions will cost the exchequer in the region of €1.5 billion, and cost some 150,000 jobs, the Tánaiste has said.

The combined cost of three government schemes - the pandemic unemployment payment (PUP), Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and Covid Restrictions Subsidy Scheme (CRSS) will be some €200 million per week.

Asked about the financial impact of the measures, the Taoiseach said they would be funded by borrowing, but acknowledge that the long term impact was significant. “We can do it this year, we can do it next year. We need a vaccine next year,” he said.


However, Minister for Business Leo Varadkar said that those figures could be impacted by the failure of businesses, which would also affect tax revenues. Mr Varadkar told business leaders that they had done “nothing wrong” in recent months. “In fact, you’ve done everything right,” he said, adding that the decisions taken last night were driven by a “need to reduce interactions that occur between adults and different households”.

In 2020, we have ways of testing and diagnosing people who don't even have a single sniffle, so we have more mild infections to show for it. There were likely people in 1918 who had mild cold- like illnesses that were actually H1N1 Spanish Flu, but mild cases.

1.
give (someone) authority to act in a certain way.

Sure, most nations are not autocratic police states, but it's a demonstration of what can be achieved, nonetheless.  

More practically, it seems the most successful ""free"" nations followed strategies that can be broken down into 2 categories depending on situation: if you're starting your measures early enough before there's already a real outbreak in your area (like Taiwan), or if you're already dealing with a major outbreak and are playing catch-up.  

If you're starting early enough, mask requirements (even per citizen distribution quotas like in Taiwan), aggressively ramping up testing, and implementing an effective TTI program seemed to work.  

If you've already got an outbreak, a hard lockdown seems to be the shortest path back to controlling the virus. In this scenario, unless you have an essential job, you won't be commuting anyplace for the duration of the lockdown. Those without essential jobs, and those that cannot work from home would need to be subsidized by the government during the lockdown. Essentially a lockdown-duration UBI. The state of Victoria in Australia got its recent surge under control in about 100 days, but you probably could do better if you are even stricter. I wonder if 6 to 8 weeks would do?  

At the same time, the government should gear up for coming out of lockdown. Working on having good TTI ready, and preparing a stimulus to bolster the economy, having mask mandates ready, etc.  

DO NOT RE-OPEN TOO SOON. I think New Zealand has set the standard for how to determine when it's OK to re-open. Most nations that re-opened earlier are now paying for their mistakes.  

If the EU can't coordinate these strategies for the entire region at once, it's then up to individual countries or even individual regions within countries to execute such strategies.  

Will there be pain to go through during the lockdown? Certainly, but on balance it would almost certainly be better than the protracted waves of infection most nations are currently suffering.

I constantly read about smart things the Asians are doing that we just don't do in the West.

The Chinese for instance can test an entire city to find the positives, and then they isolate the positives.

We could also do that in the West - it would be a huge help to make some areas virus free - also for the local businesses.

ALso the Chinese test everybody entering the country, and isolate them if they are positive.

In the west, we just let anybody come in and infect away if they are sick lol.

At one point we had a curfew of 8pm, 5km radius, only 1 hour of outdoor time, so on, but by this point a lot of the restrictions have lifted. We have no curfew and no limit on time we can spend outside (to exercise, shop, go to work or to get health services), our radius is now 25km, hairdressers and some other businesses are starting to open, etc. We can't go out of the city boundaries, and we can't go to restaurants and pubs (no shit), but that is probably gonna change on the 2nd of November (and depending on the cases maybe even on the 26th of October - has to be an average of 5 and a total unknown cases of 5).

Since the stay-at-home order was lifted, the businesses have put up half-assed signs but not enforced anything, people walking around everywhere with their masks on improperly or not at all and these bars, all ***8*** of them on my block, are constantly full. 

Not content to get their beer, liquor and wine delivered, these people crowd the bars with the happiest abandon, absolutely sure that tonight’s drinking session rubbing up against anyone and everyone while trying to read the chopped captions on espn and drinking overpriced drinks is worth perhaps getting sick and getting others sick. 

This place was done with covid before it even started infecting people here. Most people have already decided that Wisconsin folk are just too good-natured, wholesome and hard-working to be affected by the “librul virus”. They can just ignore it and it will just go away. Never mind republican lawmakers have forced every hand in the state to push people to stay working, especially the cashiers, stock people, hairdressers and janitors.  

Unemployment had to be rewritten from the ground up and STILL isn’t caught up, people still waiting on checks they’ve been owed for SIX MONTHS. No relief in sight for any class lower than corporate, small businesses closing up and then immediately getting snapped up by large firms obviously salivating over reduced prices from foreclosures. People getting thrown out on the street because loopholes in the rent moratorium still allows evictions like at-will employment protects against discrimination.  But oh, we will absolutely restructure and still help out Foxconn so they can get their subsidies even though the buildings they bulldozed people’s homes for are all empty except some broken elevators and a fleet of drained electric golf carts.

This place is falling apart at the seams thanks to republicans. They stripped the governor of any power during walker’s lame-duck session but now refuse to do any kind of actual lawmaking or governing, they just gavel in and out of special sessions while screaming that nothings getting done and blaming it on across the aisle. They’re too busy keeping paraplegic Democrat lawmakers from being able to attend sessions by phone because, as a person without a functioning WHOLE BODY, it’s kinda hard to make the trip all the way to the office sometimes! Since he can’t make it sometimes, though, the taxpayers time is much better spent on legislation that requires in-person attendance and completely butt-fucks the ADA and accommodation of disabilities act. But it’s the government so nobody give a toot.

Fucking Wisconsin. I’d leave but they’d rather punish a person for smoking weed than even attempt to investigate a known, convicted sexual and child sexual predator.

from the article:

&gt;Before the coronavirus even arrived, the U.S. was in the midst of the deadliest drug overdose epidemic in its history, with a record 71,000 overdose deaths last year.  
&gt;  
&gt;Nearly 74,000 overdose deaths were counted from April 2019 to March 2020, up from the 68,000 reported for the comparable period one year earlier.

[from wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl)

&gt;Fentanyl was first synthesized in Belgium by Paul Janssen  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2017, it was the 250th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1.7 million prescriptions

I did more digging and I think you're referring to this? ""Currently, China remains the primary source of fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances trafficked through international mail and express consignment operations environment, as well as the main source for all fentanyl-related substances trafficked into the United States."" [from the DEA](https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/DEA_GOV_DIR-008-20%20Fentanyl%20Flow%20in%20the%20United%20States_0.pdf)

Which, I get why you'd say that, the DEA also notes:

&gt;As Beijing and the Hong Kong Special Autonomous Region (SAR) place restrictions on more precursor chemicals, Mexican transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) are diversifying their sources of supply. This is evidenced by fentanyl shipments from India allegedly destined for Mexico.

But regardless, it's not as though people in the illicit drug trade in China specifically targeted Americans. I think everyone involved (according to the DEA's map: Americans, Canadians, Chinese, Indians, Mexicans) are doing it for money, and America appears to have a large market for the illegally made drug, probably because it's so prolific in its legal form.",,,1603228152,{},g9h43ng,False,t3_jevunr,False,False,t1_g9gnnch,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jevunr/overdose_deaths_appear_to_rise_amid_coronavirus/g9h43ng/,1603234184,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

You work x at Volga industries and you buy y litters of vodka.

What is private ownership in ""capitalism"", a deputized authority over land/building, to do as you please, within the guidelines set by the authority that deputized you.  Whether you were a commissar granted the authority to supervise all operations in a factory, or a farm, or you were the owner of it (based on a contract with the state on what your rights and obligations are) it makes little difference.

The education system there guided you in being a submissive soldier of that central authority, just as it was on the other side of the famous wall.  Both systems are as far from true democracy (true equality - economic and political) as any previous centralized authority system they replaced.  In fact it is worse, because centuries ago you had the freedom to depart city walls and live on your own, today you have no such freedom.  Even oceans and free international passage is revoked and states claimed right hundreds of miles offshore to lease them out to oil industry.  Individual freedom is a myth that keeps societies powerless, unorganized and disorganized, within the cannibalistic system of the markets.

Granted, my mom and my in-laws aren't deliberately being unsafe.

My in-laws don't ever go anywhere or see anyone, so technically they are safe... for *us*. 

But we are not safe for them. My husband is an essential worker There's an active outbreak at his work right now. His job is a bit unique in that he spends the majority of his time in an office setting. But he has to interact with coworkers and the public in person very frequently, and there's no other way around it. He manages it as safely as he can, but we know his exposure risk is a lot higher.

The last thing I want to do is unknowingly bring them the gift of COVID for the holidays.

Instead, I'm trying to think of ways to virtually ""gather"". Maybe having dinner together over Zoom. Maybe having private Zoom sessions with our daughter and her grandparents and cousins to open gifts. Maybe planning special activities (like a baking session, or a paint night, or a game night) and inviting family/friends.

&gt;THE FACTS: He’s botching the study’s findings, repeatedly. The study cited, by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, did not find that 85% of mask wearers catch COVID-19. If that were the case, the majority of Americans would be infected.

&gt;It found something quite different: that 85% of the small group of COVID-19 patients surveyed — about 150 on this question — reported they had worn a mask often or always around the time they would have become infected.

&gt;The group’s exposure to potentially infected people in the community varied. Most reported shopping or being in a home with multiple people. But they were twice as likely to have eaten at a restaurant, where masks are set aside for the meal, than were uninfected people in a control group.

Is it really essential for giant fast food chains to be opening locations right now? No it is not. I get to work from home, but not everyone at an ""essential"" office or other job is able or allowed to. Plenty of people have been forced to work in an office despite having the ability to work from home, because it isn't illegal for the company to deny them WFH.

That would reduce the total number of kids that needed to be watched. Some would have a single parent at home, others would have both. The families where both parents are essential workers would then be able to have a bubble with a single other family, or daycares or schools could be open with extremely limited capacity for those leftover kids and only young, healthy staff with all the precautions, and they could have a lot of outside time to be even safer. This would have the total vectors of infection massively reduced. There are so many obvious options that would have reduced the impact of the pandemic from the start, but our country decided that businesses were the ones who needed the money, that everyone is an essential worker, and that it's up to individuals to decide whether they're down to get COVID at their local bar or from their friends who claim they're not hanging out with other people.",,,1603219354,{},g9gjz3c,False,t3_je5dez,False,False,t1_g9f90d0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/je5dez/do_not_invite_anyone_over_to_your_home_chicagos/g9gjz3c/,1603222764,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I agreed with another poster who lives in Italy, which is not anecdotal, that's observational which is more valuable than your shitty example.  You point out that 'cases were already rising' but it's a slippery slope to say that everyone wasn't already not using masks.  If they were already going to remove it, that  likely means people were starting to relax and not caring in more private settings when it wasn't really being monitored and even in situations where it is being monitored, it was probably pretty loose.  You act as if there's a literal police force watching every single person which just isn't the case.  Enforcing masks has more to do with the culture and people's attitude and less to do with an actual body making it happen.  People will give up over time and relax until they feel obligated to wear it again because of high death counts around them.

You have no data to say they aren't enough.  In fact, all studies show that masks do protect.  How much protection will differ greatly across how the mask is worn, what type is worn, if it is clean, etc...but acting as if they do nothing is a really poor attitude.  If you simply shrug your shoulders and say they don't do enough, that's doing more harm than good.  If a mask only reduced spread by 20%, wouldn't you say that would be worth it to ask everyone in public areas or indoors to wear them?  I mean, seriously?  We have to hit a certain number for people to believe that lives being spared are worth it?  How about we say that anything which reasonably lowers spread should be performed if feasible.

Because we live in Vermont, a US state doing pretty well at low covid because of our low population, and because my girlfriend usually only wants to see one or maybe a small group of individuals, (aka avoiding crowds) she feels that she does have to worry about Closed spaces or Close-contact conversation.

Our baseline will be that each purchase is made by 1 person.  
So, our store will see 1000 unique shoppers.  
Let’s then add in 100 Instacart employees.  
We will say that they are able to make 4 purchases each per day, and so contribute 400 of the 1000 unique purchases made.  
This means that they are able to displace 300 unique shoppers.  
So, we have now 600 regular shoppers + 100 Instacart employees for a total of 700 people shopping at that store in a given day.

Correct.  Racism is to blame.  ...Not sure it's to blame in the way you think it is, though.

Non-pacific-island-Asians, according to this article, weren't mentioned as one of the ""groups who regularly face discrimination at hospitals"" ... and therefore US society is racist against all Asians?  That's literally what this hilarious piece of shit article says.  No one even ever insinuated that non-Pacific-Island Asians shouldn't get tested.  The health advisory merely didn't include them on people that regularly face discrimination at Hospitals.  Which may very well be true but the person who wrote this article doesn't care.

""Hate crimes are increasing"" according to the article, yet the article doesn't name a single hate crime, and it relies on harkening back to early-1800's railroad building inequity to talk about discrimination.

I'm not going to pretend that Asians haven't faced discrimination in America before... But when it comes to COVID-19?  lmfao shut up.  It's in your head.

[],,purple_potatoes,,,[],,,,text,t2_4bwkr,False,False,[],"&gt; I guess the remaining question I have, if you’re willing to discuss it, is whether this information is heavily influenced by two factors: living in a low - covid area, and socializing only with a couple individuals outside her household.

Local conditions absolutely affect risk. Areas with high case load, quickly rising case load, or areas with high positive rates (anything over 5% indicates significant numbers of cases are being missed) are at a much higher risk than areas with things much more under control. That is why most places have ""levels"" of restrictions. When risk drops, restrictions drop. You are very fortunate to live in an area in relatively good shape, all things considered.

However, low risk does not mean no risk. Diseases like COVID19 spread exponentially, meaning that a single outbreak can quickly spread and become a problem extremely quickly. Diligence is needed even in lower-risk areas. It's true that [Vermont is doing rather well by US standards](https://covidactnow.org/state/VT?s=1173285), however ""by US standards"" is a very low bar to clear and does not mean safe. Currently [every US state is at or above ""yellow"" (med risk)](https://wamu.org/story/20/10/20/map-tracking-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus-in-the-u-s/#res873434568), including Vermont. ""Yellow states need to **keep up social distancing and mask usage** (emphasis mine), and both yellow and green states should continue testing and contact tracing.""

This kind of disease gets out of control very quickly, as we have seen. It's imperative to maintain diligence and follow the advice of health organizations. I, too, live in a yellow state but I am not fooled into thinking it's safe to forego basic safety measures. The health organizations don't advise safety measures to be mean or because it benefits them directly in any way. They aren't trying to make your life terrible. They of all people want this disease under control exactly so that we can live more freely. To do that, they advise safety measures because they are public health experts and understand how disease spreads. What may seem minimal to a layperson may actually be the cusp of disaster because again, exponential spread gets out of control outrageously quickly.

That said, IMO her desire to meet in very small gatherings is understandable and likely an acceptable risk given the robust monitoring and low caseload in VT. However, it's still important to diligently mitigate risks. She and her friends/family are already significantly increasing risk just by meeting indoors and sitting closely. However, sometimes weather and space availability make a closed indoor space the only option. This is where masks come in. Masks are a last resort. They are not an alternative to social distancing, they are a final safety measure for when distancing isn't possible. She should still try to maintain distance and ventilation in the space if possible, but at the very least wear a mask. It's really quite effortless and essential if they're already significantly increasing their risk by meeting closely indoors. I really do not understand the resistance to masking.

Finally, I want to address this point more:

&gt;socializing only with a couple individuals outside her household.

A lot of people think, oh, I'm just meeting with one or two other households, that's not a lot. It's not an outrageous concept; it can be done and done well. [It's been even been recommended](https://www.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/HealthU/2020/08/26/how-to-create-a-covid-bubble-and-why-you-should-consider-one/). The issue is that people think of the ""social bubble"" term too lightly. It's a means to combine very few households and only those households. Everyone needs to [agree on risk mitigation and not socialize unmitigated with other households](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-shrinking-your-social-bubble-may-be-necessary-right-now). Unfortunately, in practice, many people form multiple social bubbles or simply don't abide by the guidelines. This completely defeats the purpose and puts everyone at risk. Multiple bubbles means [things get connected very quickly](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Covid-19-Bubble-spread-02-1.gif) which is literally the opposite what the bubble is supposed to do (which is to create an isolated social circle of people). Even visiting ""[just one friend](https://www.washington.edu/news/2020/04/13/just-one-friend-covid-19/)"" connects over two thirds of households. So while she may think, oh, it's just a few people, in reality even just a few people connects the entire community and puts everyone at risk.

Now I don't say this to argue that in-person socialization should not happen. On the contrary, I think socialization is immensely important. However, safety of oneself and the community is also immensely important. I believe a balance can be reached if people simply maintain appropriate safety measures. Limit gatherings in frequency and size, maintain distance and ventilation, wear a mask consistently. Each high-risk action taken makes the other mitigation factors even more important. So if close contact is required then masks/ventilation/limiting time are even *more* important than they were already. If enclosed spaces are required then distance/ventilation/masking are even *more* important. I see many people who are willing to accept one high-risk situation (one of the 3 C's) but then for some reason decide that one high-risk factor means that all other protections should just be dropped. It's boggling because the exact *opposite* needs to happen. When risky activities are unavoidable then the other mitigation factors are that much more important to keeping risk low. Again, socializing is not the problem, the complete lack of risk mitigation is the problem. I hope your girlfriend is able to recognize that she really really needs to maintain safety measures as much as possible if she's going to choose to socialize in-person. Just because she's ""done"" with the pandemic doesn't mean the pandemic is done.

Also that argument makes no sense. Having a larger population alone is meaningless, unless you're arguing that the average person in the US has more contact with different individuals than the average person in Singapore? I highly doubt that.

&gt;And it makes zero sense to discount population density as a factor given the way viruses spread.

It is a factor, although no studies place it as the main one. Also, while not as dense as Stockholm, you're heavily discounting how dense cities in Norway, Finland or even New Zealand are.

&gt;But it seems like you've decided on one thing (lockdown = good) and are then working backwards to prove this. And that's not how science works. Also what constitutes a ""lockdown"" is very important too, closing down some things might help while closing down other things could be unnecessary or even make things worse. This is a complicated situation that you're trying to find an easy answer for.

This argument against is vacuous. All the factors that you've posited would make a pandemic worse in Sweden are *much more* prevalent in New York:

- Much higher population density? Check. 

- A far bigger proportion of the population that relies on public transport? Check. 

- A higher % of immigrants? Check. 

Yet, New York managed to flatten their curve much faster than Sweden. Why don't you explain that?

Regardless, you see this trend to varying degrees for almost every country that went into early lockdown versus ones that didn't, namely Sweden. To outright dismiss this trend is you choosing to bury your head in the sand to the reality that lockdowns do help in getting the outbreak under control quickly.

Ironically, all the factors you've listed that worked against Sweden are arguments as to why a lockdown would have helped Sweden deal with their initial surge.

&gt;while closing down other things could be unnecessary or even make things worse.

Good, give examples of lockdowns making things worse then.",,,1603213946,{},g9g8tju,False,t3_jej2u8,False,True,t1_g9fonac,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jej2u8/swedish_virologist_says_her_countrys_covid19/g9g8tju/,1603216058,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

- They’re likely going to focus on young, healthy volunteers to “minimize” risk, which means no data on higher-risk people (the people we most need data for).

- Infection rates are high enough that the 30k people in non-challenge Phase 3 trials are still more than sufficient to obtain the few hundred infections necessary for efficacy determination well before the end of the trial.

- A Phase 3 trial with 30k participants is still necessary to determine safety and look for rare adverse events. The (at least) several-month follow-up period is also still required to determine longer-term protection and adverse events.

So a challenge trial won’t reduce the sample size or the time required for phase 3 trials, and those trials are already giving us more-than-adequate efficacy data.  The challenge trials are just a useless and dangerous stunt.

Edit: It’s worse: the first challenge trial isn’t to test the vaccine - it’s to determine the minimal nasal dose to infect people with SARS-CoV-2.

1. Mink eat ALL the leftovers from our meat and fish industry. If we don't have minks, we should get rid of all this waste somewhere else. 
2. Mink fertilizer is ""organic"" and therefore used on your ""organic tomato"". 
3. Mink corpses are burned down to bio-fuel, guess what this is? Green energy. You wanted more of that? Well, here you go.
4. Mink fur is a billion industry where the furs are mainly bought by customers from China and Russia. If the Western countries close down our farms, then the farms will move to ... guess what, China and Russia. How much control and animal welfare do we have here? Well.... If you wish for horror stories about animals, well go there. Did we forget where the Corona originally started?
5. I don't know about the US, but at least Scandinavian fur is the world's best and most expensive fur world-wide and how do you get good fur? You keep the mink happy and well-fed with fresh food. In Scandinavia we have the STRICTEST laws when it comes to fur farming and this means that all minks live in pairs/communities, have toys, cave, fresh food and fresh straw. If they don't have that, you can't sell your fur. All farms are OPEN for visitors and you can always visit them. 
6. Finally: The cows where you milk comes from are caged as well. Pigs are caged. Egg hens are caged, but because we eat those for some reason people think it's different. The fashion industry is one of the worst environmental factors today, and plastic materials such as polyester/acrylic are using petroleum and oil to produce. Cotton is the worst ever crop in terms of amount of pesticides and water and cotton fields kills more wild life and biodiversity than any mink farm has ever done.
7. Fur lasts 20-50 years or more and is naturally degenerated in nature. When you have a better way to combat fast fashion, I'll gladly listen. 

Yeah... lets close all of it, feel good about ourselves and let future minks suffer in the middle of nowhere in China and Russia while we wear our feel-good-polyester made in China. I am sure that the activists can make the Chinese government change their mind about animal welfare..

**If you don't support fur: Don't buy it.**  
**If you want the best for our animals: Let's keep the farms in the West.**

It is about tightening the advice, says Anders Tegnell. It is not excluded that the councils for Uppsala may apply to more regions. It is the pressure on healthcare that causes FHM to introduce local restrictions for Uppsala. We see an increased spread of *society* in Uppsala, says Anders Tegnell. This is thus not about so-called *cluster spread* , even though the infection can in some cases be linked to individual gatherings, Tegnell further explains.

FHM has chosen not to introduce recommendations for entry and exit for the Uppsala region.

&gt;\- If you are going to a **restaurant**, feel free to do so, but do it with family and those you spend close time with, says Anders Tegnell, state epidemiologist, Public Health Agency.  
&gt;  
&gt;According to Anders Tegnell, it is not relevant to close any restaurants or other public activities.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- This is general advice and it is up to each establishment if you want to close.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;About the **new advice for stores**, Anders Tegnell says:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- In the first place, it is important to make it possible for people to keep their distance, for example not letting in too many at once, have clear markings and make it as easy as possible not to actually create new chains of infection.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Has FHM clarified how ""physical contact"" in the tightened Uppsala councils should be interpreted? Is it physical direct contact (skin to skin) or is it socializing that is referred to?*

This was raised during the press conference. Physical contact in a corona context is not skin to skin, it is enough to be close to each other, about one meter and for about a quarter.

\- It is the type of contacts that entails the highest risk of infection and it is the type of contacts we want to minimize in Uppsala as much as possible, says city epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell.

*But it is the same as the general council to keep your distance, what is the difference?* *(for the local restrictions in Uppsala ed. note)*

\- The difference now is that we point very clearly to certain activities where it is quite obviously difficult to maintain that type of distance. And we make it even clearer that it can be difficult or impossible to carry out a party without ending up in such close contact.

\- Instead of having a more general recommendation to keep distance, we now also point to a number of different activities where we now know that it is difficult to keep distance because we see the spread of infection in that type of activity.

*What do you know about the role of super-spiders in the spread of infection?*

\- It is when a person is in a certain context that you can become a super-spreader. We are collecting information in the country and we have not seen so many examples of super spreaders in Sweden, says Anders Tegnell.

*What happens if you notice that people are not complying with these restrictions?*

\- We have good experience from this spring, but if they are not complied with, we must consider other solutions, says Anders Tegnell.",,,1603198389,{},g9ff5kw,True,t3_jeofku,False,True,t1_g9fcu5a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jeofku/sweden_public_health_authority_update_106380_3180/g9ff5kw/,1603198400,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

What is the potential impact of accelerating the development of one additional vaccine? 
We do not have the manufacturing or supply chain capacity to produce the billions of vaccine doses needed across the globe with just one vaccine. Accelerating the development of just one additional safe and effective vaccine by even a couple of days could save thousands of lives. 

Measuring the exact impact is difficult. It is currently uncertain how many people COVID-19 will affect worldwide and at what speed its impacts will be felt. Possible outcomes are shaped by interventions like social distancing, the capacity of health systems, potential drug treatments, and many other factors. A vaccine may come after the infection has peaked or once effective pharmaceutical treatments have blunted COVID-19’s impact. But it is clear that COVID-19 will continue to alter daily life until an effective vaccine is fully deployed. 

While any estimate is deeply uncertain, to give a sense of the scale of a vaccine’s impact, suppose that daily confirmed COVID-19 deaths remain at July 2020 average of around 5,000 per day. If an additional vaccine could avert just 25% of these deaths, then speeding up vaccine development by: 

1 day saves 1,250 lives
1 week saves 8,750 lives
1 month saves 37,500 lives
3 months saves 112,500 lives

I think me and the other over 38k people who signed up just want to help to end this earlier and with less victims. Not only deaths by covid. Starving people. Jobloss. Longhaulers. Think of all the bad things covid brought. All. maybe we can end this suffering earlier. Maybe it will have no Impact but it s worth for me to try.

The provincial health boards already have the logistics in place from flu vaccines, so I think (hope?) it'll be fairly smooth, though obviously a larger scale effort. But still, it will take a few months, with the first rounds probably going to high risk people. 

For comparison:

For the flu vaccine here in Ontario, they ordered 5.4M doses for a population of 14.6M. The first few shipments went FAST, but they're easy to get, available all over town. I have half a dozen spots within walking distance of home that offer the flu shot, walked down over my lunch break a few weeks ago to get one and was in and out pretty quickly. There have been some complaints about specific pharmacies and clinics being out of stock, but I can see from the Shoppers Drug Mart map that two near me have them right now, and that doesn't count other pharmacies and clinics in the area. Basically if you want one right now, you can get one, but it may require going to a different location.

*Published on: 30 March 2020COVID-19, shortages of masks and the use of cloth masks as a last resort*

&amp;#x200B;

*Critical  shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) have resulted in the  US Centers for Disease Control downgrading their recommendations for  health workers treating COVID-19 patients from respirators to surgical  masks and finally to home-made cloth masks. As authors of the only  published randomised controlled clinical trial of cloth masks, we have  been getting daily emails about this from health workers concerned about  using cloth masks. The study found that cloth mask wearers had higher  rates of infection than even the standard practice control group of  health workers, and the filtration provided by cloth masks was poor  compared to surgical masks.  At the time of the study, there had been  very little work done in this space, and so little thought into how to  improve the protective value of the cloth masks. Until now, most  guidelines on PPE did not even mention cloth masks, despite many health  workers in Asia using them.*  

*Health workers are asking us if they should wear no mask at all if  cloth masks are the only option.   Our research does not condone health  workers working unprotected.  We recommend that health workers should  not work during the COVID-19 pandemic without respiratory protection as a  matter of work health and safety. In addition, if health workers get  infected, high rates of staff absenteeism from illness may also affect  health system capacity to respond. Some health workers may still choose  to work in inadequate PPE. In this case, the physical barrier provided  by a cloth mask may afford some protection, but likely much less than a  surgical mask or a respirator.* 

*It is important to note that some subjects in the control arm wore  surgical masks, which could explain why cloth masks performed poorly  compared to the control group.  We also did an analysis of all mask  wearers, and the higher infection rate in cloth mask group persisted.  The cloth masks may have been worse in our study because they were not  washed well enough – they may become damp and contaminated. The cloth  masks used in our study were products manufactured locally, and fabrics  can vary in quality.  This and other limitations were also discussed.* 

*There are now numerous reports of health workers wearing home made  cloth masks, or re-using disposable mask and respirators, and asking for  guidance. If health workers choose to work in these circumstances,  guidance should be given around the use.* 

*There have been a number of laboratory studies looking at the  effectiveness of different types of cloth materials, single versus  multiple layers and about the role that filters can play. However, none  have been tested in a clinical trial for efficacy.  If health workers  choose to work using cloth masks, we suggest that they have at least two  and cycle them, so that each one can be washed and dried after daily  use. Sanitizer spray or UV disinfection boxes can be used to clean them  during breaks in a single day.   These are pragmatic, rather than  evidence-based suggestions, given the situation.* 

*Finally for COVID-19, wearing a mask is not enough to protect  healthcare workers – use of gloves and goggles are also required as a  minimum, as SARS-CoV-2 may infect not only through the respiratory  route, but also through contact with contaminated surfaces and  self-contamination.* 

*Governments and hospitals should plan and stockpile proper disposable  products such as respirators and surgical masks to ensure the  occupational health and safety of health workers. This appears to have  been a failure in many countries, including high income countries.*

The pope wore a white mask during the service at the Rome Basilica of Santa Maria in Aracoeli. Previously he wore masks only in a car taking him to his weekly audiences in the Vatican.

He had come under some criticism, particularly on social media, for not wearing a mask at his general audiences and sometimes coming in relatively close contact with visitors.

Francis, 83, attended the service with other Christian leaders in the basilica, including the Patriarch Bartholomew, spiritual leader of Orthodox Christians.

Simultaneously in other locations in Rome, Jews were praying in the city’s synagogue and Buddhist, Sikh, Hindu and Muslim leaders also prayed for peace.

The event took place as the number of people who have tested positive for the coronavirus has risen steadily in Italy in the past few weeks.

There has also been a relatively small spike in the Vatican, where four members of the Swiss Guards, the elite and colourfully dressed corps that protects the pope, have also tested positive for COVID-19.

The annual event was started by the late Pope John Paul and Rome’s Catholic Community of Sant’ Egido in 1986. It was scaled down this year because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The pope took off his mask while he read his address, as did other leaders when they spoke, but put it back on when he finished speaking.

The pope had part of one lung removed during an illness when he was a young man in his native Argentina. He sometimes breathes heavily after climbing steps.

Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury and spiritual leader of the world’s Anglicans, was to have attended the event but could not because of COVID-19 restrictions.",,,1603211384,{},g9g3hw9,True,t3_jesyd5,False,True,t3_jesyd5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jesyd5/pope_wears_mask_for_first_time_at_public_service/g9g3hw9/,1603212790,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

They conducted lab studies, leaving samples out for days on various surfaces, and found they could culture the remaining virus in tissue. In other words, it remained infectious. Then they gathered samples from highly contaminated environments: Covid-19 isolation wards at a hospital, and at a hotel used for people in quarantine. The virus was abundant.

In addition to environmental conditions, a confounding factor might be saliva, or the stuff that we often mean when we talk about droplets sticking onto surfaces. In her own research, Wyllie has studied how long certain viral proteins remain intact in saliva to help determine the reliability of Covid-19 spit tests. For her purposes, stability is a good thing. But some proteins have appeared to denature more quickly than others, she notes, suggesting the virus as a whole does not remain intact and infectious. That could be because saliva tends to be less hospitable to pathogens than the synthetic substances or blood serums often used in lab-based stability studies.",,,1603205499,{},g9frjyw,False,t3_jeqt1a,False,True,t3_jeqt1a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jeqt1a/its_time_to_talk_about_covid19_and_surfaces_again/g9frjyw/,1603205746,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

You can't just look at how many died from the virus.

Deliberately absurd proposal no: Let's kill everybody. This is the optimal outcome since now nobody died from the virus. Our measurement will indicate that only a few people died from the virus compared to our neighbours (assuming the strategy is properly carried out)

This is blatantly absurd and it should be obvious that measuring how successful the approach is is more complex than just counting how many died. In this case I also used a deliberately absurd method to handle the pandemic, but the important thing is the absurd method *would work* given the choice of measurement.

What ever action you take to deal with the pandemic will have side effects. You need to consider those side effects or you will end up with a cure worse than the disease.

Of course you might remain unconvinced by the above, so let's continue with a second problem of the measurement. The fact is that you simply can't know every factor that affects the spread of the pandemic. What you are looking at is a complex system of interacting and interdependent variables. Saying anything about the success of a particular method given just a simple measurement (number of dead people) misses the fact there are more factors at play besides just how hard of a lockdown you chose.

Yes, I am arguing that. Bigger populations = more super-spreaders. It's ultimately these people that spread viruses the most, not people only interacting in their small social circles.

&gt;This argument against is vacuous. All the factors that you've posited would make a pandemic worse in Sweden are *much more* prevalent in New York:

We're not comparing Stockholm and New York since those are very different cities, it would be like comparing apples and oranges. You wouldn't even be able to scratch the surface in comparing them - you'd need to take too many factors into account. Comparing Scandinavian countries is easier since they're more similar. But the point is that even if they're similar they're not identical, and taking differences into account is vital if you're going to compare them properly.

This is not a one-size fits all. You can't decide that only one variable (size of immigrant community) impacts spread and then compare immigrant sizes in different countries point blank. The immigrant % is an *indicator* specifically *within these societies*, because of its side-effects *in that community* (such as overcrowding, multi-generational households, translation issues, sometimes a lack of trust in authorities and culture of specific immigrant groups) - it's **those** things that impact spread. But you can never look at one variable alone either.

Many people also have a tendency to pick two cities to compare that will provide them with favourable results (confirmation bias), and to assume that correlation = causation. The same mistake is done with masks, saying that because East Asia uses masks and has good numbers that means masks = low numbers. That's not how science works, that's the typical mistake of confusing correlation with causation. What's needed to truly compare between countries is a thorough analysis.

&gt;you see this trend to varying degrees for almost every country that went into early lockdown versus ones that didn't, namely Sweden. To outright dismiss this trend is you choosing to bury your head in the sand to the reality that lockdowns do help in getting the outbreak under control quickly.

What does this even mean? The entire point of flattening the curve is to not overload healthcare, and in Sweden's case the aim was to create a sustainable long-term plan in a hope to not overload healthcare even with ups and downs until a vaccine arrives. And we know quarantines can be used to contain disease, yes, but they have costs too. And there's nothing to really imply that Sweden's case amount would have looked any different if they had locked down like Denmark did. Norway had a less strict lockdowns but has fewer excess deaths than Denmark. Why? Because there are other factors at play here, it's not as easy as just comparing A and B point-blank.

Sweden whether locked down or not would still have had a huge death count amongst the elderly because this was spread by people doing essential jobs - paid-by-the-hour employees with low income security who worked at more than one nursing home and who would not have dared to stay home when sick. This was a failure of the elderly care system which would have existed regardless. The fact that these workers are also predominantly from these low-income immigrant-heavy suburbs which were the hotspots of the outbreak also explains this spread to elderly homes. That's just really bad luck. This was right at the beginning of the pandemic, Sweden locking down wouldn't have prevented this.

So again, you're trying to oversimplify a complicated issue.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Good, give examples of lockdowns making things worse then.

Aside from mental health issues what about increases in poverty and poverty-related (and obesity-related) illnesses? Or increases in abuse/malnutrition in children who are kept out of school (not to mention how this can be impacting their future negatively)?

Not to mention the fact that it's been proven now that spread outdoors barely ever happens, and that it's the indoors that is dangerous. Which is why it wasn't so ideal when certain countries made people cram together at home like sardines (therefore lessening their overall health and Vitamin D levels - something that has shown promise in helping against COVID-19), while at the same time banning them from being outdoors or taking walks in the park because it wasn't ""essential"" (this is no longer done, but some countries did this in the beginning).

Not to mention that it forces the not-tiny part of the human population who will always ignore rules/recommendations, who are then ""forced"" to get together and socialize indoors instead rather than outdoors, therefore increasing risk of spread. Accepting the reality that there will always be people who ignore the rules is just being pragmatic, and the actions of these people needs to be taken into account when determining strategy. You don't plan a strategy for an ideal world where everyone acts 100% correctly all the time.",,,1603227982,{},g9h3ohu,False,t3_jej2u8,False,True,t1_g9g8tju,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jej2u8/swedish_virologist_says_her_countrys_covid19/g9h3ohu/,1603233960,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Furthermore, the swine flu is only a variant of the flu and we knew how to treat it more or less from the start as it was susceptible for neuraminidase inhibitors. 

This is not the case for Sars-CoV2. It is far more deadly (swine flu death with laboratory-diagnostically confirmed cases: 18.5k, the Lancet published a study later on with an estimate of 150 to 575k deaths) and we are already at twice to six times the number of deaths alone with Covid-19. The key difference is that the 1+ million deaths are laboratory-diagnostically confirmed. Again, the true number of deaths exceeds that.

[],,Mister_Met,,,[],,,,text,t2_3clhd3st,False,False,[],"This is exactly why there *needs* to be a **federal** law mandating masks **right fucking now**.

In many ways this doesn’t go far enough however, because often even people who wear masks do so wrongly. By no fault of their own. It just happens. For this reason there should be a task force of specialists who can monitor that these masks are being worn correctly. They can spread out into the communities and do this work.

As part of that, people who have willfully put their fellow citizens in danger need to be identified. This obviously includes anybody who voted for Trump. These people should have a special insignia on their masks so they can be identified by authorities for the sake of the public good.

Their children should perhaps have a slightly less conspicuous symbol on their masks — something to identify the very real risk they are in as a result of being raised by such enemies of society and of science.

As part of a new nationwide emphasis on public health, citizens should be encouraged to identify people who are “enemies” of this progress. Once identified, these individuals should be given a chance to repent and change their ways. But this progress will of course need to be monitored by the government, so they should have a third type of insignia on their masks, to ease identification.

To facilitate compliance with the new public health measures, a new agency of the government should be created. The task force I mentioned above can easily be adopted to this work. These individuals will be employed by the federal government but not identified as such. This is to help gain a measure of trust from the population. Their jobs will be to keep files on individuals within their purview, and update these files regularly to track progress.

Obviously people who willingly violate the new mask law will have to be separated from society — for the good of society, as well as for their own good. This will be dealt with humanely and fairly. Not at all like Nazis. These individuals will simply be separated from their families and society and moved to a safe place for a time being. All perfectly humane and fair. These safe places will seek to educate them to the evil of their ways and the harm they are doing to the world. Once re-educated they can be returned to society. Of course repeat offenders will have to be dealt with a little more harshly. 

But this will be for their own benefit. Eventually individuals who have proven to be a menace to society and a danger to the security of the state, will have to be permanently removed. This too will be done humanely, but the key is that it will be done for the good of the collective whole. Because in such a system there will really be no space for individualism. This selfish attitude is exactly what got us into such trouble in the first place.

So selfish activity will have to be controlled in all aspects of society, especially the economic realm. Individuals will not be allowed to hoard cash. A progressive tax policy will of course help this to be redistributed, to aid the less fortunate. With cash hoarding outlawed, banks will not have any reason to exist. So they can probably be done away with first. People who run these banks will have to be identified as enemies of the state and placed in camps until they see the error of their ways and can be returned to society. But of course they will not be allowed to enter in an advantageous position, but somewhere near the base, where they will be reduced to doing manual tasks that help the greater good. Needless to say they will also have a special insignia on their masks that identifies them as a part of this dangerous class of individuals.

Business owners of all stripes will have to receive the same treatment as the managers of banks. Of course they will be understanding and will welcome an opportunity to make amends to society. However those that do not will, for their own protection, have to be removed from society.

There are other measures that will have to be taken vis-a-vis the bourgeoisie who have brought so much pain unto the country. But that can be tackled later.

**The important thing is that it should 100% be against the fucking law to leave your house without wearing a mask.**

Frankly they should require wearing them even when you are home and even when you’re alone. But for now it should simply be strictly outlawed in public. Anybody caught flaunting this very important rule will have to be dealt with very harshly. Penalties are not enough. Imprisonment, of an indefinite period (at least a year, and up to five or even ten years) for first time offenders. No exceptions, no appeals. Second-time offenders are sent to top secret camps permanently. These camps will be for degenerates and other repeat violators of these laws. For security reasons they will have to be off limits to all but a small group of security professionals with special clearance. Red Cross and other international organizations will not be allowed anywhere near their premises. This to make sure such harmful individuals are kept out of sight and out of mind. It is only fair, correct, and proper that such measures are taken against people who willfully go out in public without masks.",,,1603222096,{},g9gppek,False,t3_jeohzf,False,True,t3_jeohzf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jeohzf/people_are_dying_every_night_staff_at_overwhelmed/g9gppek/,1603226203,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Maybe 30,000 is acceptable to everyone else but not for me. I would be happy to wear a mask in public during the 6 weeks of bad flu season at whatever number the health department decides to suggest it, since it literally takes no effort. You're trolling the wrong person because I've already been interested in influenza mitigation. I had H1N1 in 2012 and it was awful


Mask mandates are problematic because people constantly sue and use the courts to decide if the state government can actually issue a mandate and half the time its struck down, in addition to government and health officials receiving death threats and harassment, and one high profile kidnapping plot. People are big babies.

I trust the scientists to make the call, and I'll follow whatever they recommend. If they want to save the life of one child and ask us all to wear masks for 4 weeks to save him idgaf, it works for me.

Your'e obviously right that COVID vaccine development is moving significantly faster than a normal vaccine because of the sheer scale of development efforts - the huge number of competitors trying to find a vaccine, the removal/streamlining of usually slow steps (eg. multi-year trials), the blurring of steps (eg. starting Step 4 before Step 3 is finished), etc. The NYT article I linked goes into very good detail on that, and it has a series of super interesting interactive graphs that are great for visualizing what shrinking the timeline actually looks like. 

As I noted in my comment, the NYT article notes that the accelerated timeline for the COVID vaccine -roughly 18 months - would be the fastest in history. It's worth noting that 'almost there' does not mean 'almost in the population'. It means it is almost ready to enter review and potentially be distributed sometime in the future. IIRC either AstraZeneca or Pfizer said the end of November is a potential window for having a vaccine ready for review, which would be amazing. However, rolling the vaccine out and getting it to the general population would take far longer. 

In case it's unclear...my opinion is not: ""it's time to face reality: we should just ease restrictions and forget about a vaccine that will never come!"" My opinion is: ""telling people to stay isolated from human contact until there is a widely available vaccine is both unrealistic and irresponsible, because we ultimately don't know when we will have access to the vaccine, how effective the vaccine will be, or whether we will need boosters/multiple doses.""",,,1603200473,{},g9figsd,False,t3_jdnob9,False,True,t1_g9fc6sz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jdnob9/italy_reports_more_than_11000_new_coronavirus/g9figsd/,1603200483,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Let's also not forget the fact that Sweden had an unusually mild flu season in 2019, so a higher death rate amongst the elderly in 2020 was expected. And this is just the top of the iceberg. These countries are not identical, this is not a controlled experiment. 

Your mistake in comparing countries point-blank is ignoring any of the dozens of ways in which these countries differ and that there are 100's of interacting variables that determine spread.

Using Vietnam approach when virus is so widespread is no longer feasible, as it would basically mean total lockdowns everywhere (if you close only specific villages/towns you can just bring food from outside there and have everyone inside be locked, with continent-wide lockdown you need to make lots of exceptions for essential workers which means that this lockdown will not be as effective. Not to mentions that liberal democracies are much less effective at enforcing draconian measures than police states) 
Also climate had probably something to do with it. With some exceptions like Brazil the biggest and most deadly outbreaks were in areas with around 10-15 degrees (Celsius) - in Europe pandemy almost receded during the summer and is coming back with force when temperatures started to drop. While Vietnam indeed was quite proactive in fighting the disease, some other countries like Thailand or Indonesia didn't do anything that different from what many European countries did, yet spread of the virus was relatively limited there

Not to mention Cambodia which in the 
beginning was acting like it was actively trying to spread the virus in the country (prime minister letting in one of the covid cruises in and shaking hands with everybody to show that there's nothing to fear of, allowing many Chinese in when China was still a hotbed of disease etc)

There's also a case of Japan which in theory should have very bad situation (oldest population in the World, super densely populated cities, similar climate to Europe, one of the earliest spreads outside China, not following any typical recommendations - they hardly test anyone, they didn't shut down anything - they didn't even want to cancel Olympics until very late, the only thing that they really do are masks) - yet it was affected very mildly.

And then you have Southern American countries which in many cases are implementing super strict measures yet with no much effect.

So I don't think it's easy to say why exactly some countries are doing so well and some other so bad.

Anyway, I actually don't disagree with a lot of what you're saying.  I think it's always a reasoned approach to look at things objectively and try to glean reality from multiple sources.  This can relate to anything such as history, or the daily news.  It's why I am am a registered Independent, as I think neither party comes close to having all the answers.  I tend to fall right-of-center on certain topics, and left on others.   Most of my friends have different political philosophies on multiple topics too, so I never understand how people can be comfortable aligning with just one.  It's also why I try not to demonize people, and make sure I understand positions so that I can make cogent responses.  

When I was younger I used to be very into conspiracies, having read books like Behold A Pale Horse by William Cooper, and listening to the Art Bell show every Sunday evening. I found once I started focusing on reading about history conspiracies became less interesting as the reality of things seemed even worse, and in most cases were more substantive as there were real lessons to learn that were proven out by the abuse performed on people by governments, etc. 

While I don't give any credibility to the Pizza Gate or Q Anon conspiracies, I still think there are bad things happening to children everywhere that we as a society should all want to root out and address.  I knew a guy who worked on law enforcement software based around these issues and his stories would make my toes curl.  My concern is that conspiracies like these get in the way of more substantive issues that we should all be hyper focused on addressing at all times.  Like you say, I don't need to believe in either to know bad things are still happening and we should all want to address those things as fast as possible, and whenever we can. 

Anyway, my initial curiosity was born out of interest having lost 2 uncles to Covid a few months ago.  They were both older and it got into their retirement home.  I have 2 friends who are getting over it now and it has destroyed them for a month.  They are both hyper distance runners, so I was a little shocked that it impacted them so harshly.  Statistically the mortality numbers in my area seem to be coming down, not staying with the infection rate.  I know hospitalizations are up here in the ICU, so we'll have to see how that continues.  Hopefully the mortality trend continues and we don't see a parallel course for the two.

I appreciate your thought out and detailed response.  I don't often engage online, but when I do I always appreciate it when two people can have a reasonable discussion about things they agree and disagree on.

Health Minister Salvador Illa today confirmed the possibility was being studied, but stressed it would require the support of the regions and opposition parties such as the PP.

Madrid - 20 OCT 2020 - 15:14 CEST

The Spanish government is considering introducing a nighttime curfew across the whole of the country, in a bid to bring down coronavirus infections. The executive believes, however, that it would need to do so under a state of alarm given that there is no other option that would give it the legal framework to limit a fundamental right such as that of movement in this way.

The possibility was confirmed on Tuesday by Health Minister Salvador Illa of the Socialist Party (PSOE), who pointed to the fact that other European countries are considering curfews. The political discussion on such a restriction has arrived today, however, because the Madrid regional government – which is headed by the conservative Popular Party (PP) in coalition with Ciudadanos (Citizens), and propped up by far-right Vox – made clear this morning that it is open to a curfew for the region, which once again has been particularly badly hit by the pandemic during this second wave.

Sources from the central government said today that it would not go ahead with a country-wide curfew if there is not an agreement to do so among all of Spain’s regions – some of which, like Madrid, are led by the PP. For his part, Illa today stated before reporters that such a move would not be imminent, but is being studied.
-

“It’s important to know if the PP would be willing to give its support to this,” Illa said in reference to a state of alarm and curfew, speaking at a press conference after the weekly Cabinet meeting. “A decision has not been made. It is being evaluated and studied. If it is made, it will be very important to know the political position of the PP.” The minister added that he had not had any discussions with the party about the issue.

Illa once again warned that “very tough weeks are coming,” with regard to the pandemic in Spain, and called for fresh support from other parties. “If this is where we are going,” he said, in reference to a curfew, “we need a state of alarm and I want to know who is willing to support me.”

Article 116 of the Spanish Constitution describes three legal categories for emergency situations: state of alarm, state of emergency and state of siege (in Spanish: estado de alarma, estado de excepción and estado de sitio). It is the first situation that was implemented by the Spanish government at the outset of the health crisis in March, paving the way for one of the strictest coronavirus lockdowns in the world.
-

The government can implement a state of alarm – as it did in the spring, and as it did earlier this month in the Madrid region – but it needs the support of Spain’s lower house of parliament, the Congress of Deputies, if it is to extend it. In March, the government – a center-left coalition headed by the Socialist Party, with junior partner Unidas Podemos – found support from the opposition for a state of alarm. But this backing ebbed away as the crisis deepened, and the emergency situation was eventually lifted in June when it became clear the executive – which lacks a working majority in Congress – would not have the support it needed to prolong it further.

The political challenges that face the government in terms of a curfew are similar. The Madrid regional government has said it is open to a curfew, but it does not want a state of alarm. The government believes that this is not possible. One option is to request that all citizens remain at home from midnight to 6am, but an actual curfew, where the police have powers to enforce the rules, would necessitate a state of alarm, government sources insist.

Illa also confirmed on Tuesday that the central government would not renew the state of alarm in Madrid, which is due to expire on Saturday. The central government is still unaware of what exactly the PP-led regional administration in Madrid will do this weekend in a bid to contain this second wave of the coronavirus. This morning, the region’s health chief floated the option of a curfew, or returning to a previous raft of measures that confined residents of 45 basic healthcare areas – administrative divisions that contain one or more healthcare centers.",,,1603222521,{},g9gqlw0,True,t3_jewte1,False,True,t3_jewte1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jewte1/spain_spanish_government_considering_nationwide/g9gqlw0/,1603226753,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Yeah, except no, not really. Again, you're drinking a ton of propaganda. The Catholic Church was no worse than any other organized religious group at the time.

They didn't burn libraries. The purported burning of the library of Alexandria is fictitious - seriously, look into it - there was no great burning due to religious intolerance. It simply put is not a real thing, and it did not really happen. This is the position of essentially all historians:

https://www.ancientworldmagazine.com/articles/making-myth-library-alexandria/

&gt; non-Catholic monasteries

Source? The only time I can think of them doing this is during sacks of cities - and that was the *default* behavior for **everyone** in the world at the time. If a city didn't surrender, and had to be taken in a siege, the standard was 3 days of sacking it. That was common across cultures - in the Catholic world, in the Orthodox world, in the Islamic world (c.f. Mehmet II's conquest of Constantinople), etc.

Now, you **did** see an increase in religiously motivated attacks during the reformation, but these tended to happen in religiously divided areas (think similar to partisan divides in the modern day) and tended to be perpetrated by both Protestants and Catholics.

Before that you'd see the occasional bit of religious violence, but none of these really stand out as exceptional compared to similar cultures in similar geographic areas. The Middle Ages (and early Renaissance) was a brutal time, but the Catholic world wasn't particularly more brutish, essentially.

&gt; and sacred sites for a few centuries

Again, aside from a few isolated incidents (like Charlemagne and the Saxons), I can't really think of this happening very often. Not at a rate higher than comparable nearby civilizations.

&gt; their excommunication and/or persecution of a long list of notable scientists, philosophers, and various free-thinkers in Europe for even more centuries

Again, most of these are overblown. I am not saying any of them are great - but they were par for the course for geographically nearby cultures. You could be killed for heresy or apostasy in the Orthodox, Islamic or eventually Protestant world just as easily. That only really stopped in the west after the 30 years war (which essentially destroyed Germany for a century) when all of Europe, both Protestant and Catholic collectively said, ""religious violence is stupid"" and became massively more secular.

Galileo wasn't really put under house arrest because he expressed beliefs contrary to what the Pope did, he was put under house arrest because he wrote a book with a character called ""Simplicio"" (equivalent, essentially, to Simpleton) and put the Pope's **exact** words into said character's mouth. I'm not saying pissing off the Pope is a good reason to go to jail for the rest of your life, but publicly insulting an extremely powerful ruler in the 17th century? That's pretty much going to be par for the course, if not a light sentence. And that's pretty much universal. The idea of a free press was in its infancy in this time period. That's not a Catholic thing, that's a humanity thing.

The vast majority of scientists were not excommunicated or persecuted. This is again, just a straight myth.

Think of many of the thinkers between about 1000 and 1650 (when religious violence pretty much ended in Europe):

Rene Descartes, Tycho Brahe, Nicholas Copernicus, Roger Bacon, Da Vinci, Hildegard of Bingen, Albertus Magnus

What great thinkers were persecuted? So we've got Galileo - whom as I've pointed out did a really dumb thing and insulted the Pope directly. Anyone else?

The only other one I can think of is Giordano Bruno, who was burned not because of any scientific ideas of his, but due to religious views he had. I'm not defending this action at all, but as far as I can tell, it was a fairly isolated incident. Executions for heresy weren't that common. They did tick up between 1500 and 1650 or so, and Giordano was unfortunately around in the absolute worst part of the period of religious violence.

I want to be clear - I am not saying the Catholic Church was perfect - it was a pre-modern institution, which means it was incredibly brutal to modern sensibilities. But it wasn't particularly **more** brutal than other contemporaries in other cultures.

&gt; Not to mention their modern-day stance on things like evolution and fetal development 

The Catholic Church has never expressed a position contrary to evolution, ever. They issued one in support of it in 1950.

I do agree their beliefs on fetal development are stupid and based on 19th century pseudo-science.

So once again, my point isn't that the Catholic Church is perfect - I'm a freaking atheist for god's sake, I'm definitely not making that argument - my argument is that they were not particularly more brutal than other cultures with which they were in consistent contact with. And that they were a huge preserver of knowledge between about 500 CE and 1500 CE, and that once they reformed themselves, they've been a not too terrible organization - who I want to point out, I still disagree with substantially on, as I am both an atheist, and fairly liberal.

But it's important to attack the Catholic Church for the bad stuff they actually do, not the bad stuff that is just nonsense propaganda.",,,1603222442,{},g9gqfwl,False,t3_jesyd5,False,False,t1_g9gglna,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jesyd5/pope_wears_mask_for_first_time_at_public_service/g9gqfwl/,1603226649,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

This is an incentive to put people in prison, to fund the election of judges and prosecutors who will put more people in prison for small crimes, to criminalize smaller offenses with unreasonably heavy penalties that make no sense, etc. All of which are happening.

Give prisoners workers' rights, and we not only protect our fellow humans and make sure they're not damaged for life once they have served their time to society, but we prevent millions from becoming prisoners in the first place and, incidentally, save assloads of taxpayer money by not 1. paying for their stay in prison and 2. supporting those people and their families on welfare and Medicaid once they're out of prison because they can't find a job with a felony on their records. And it'll give their kids a better chance at succeeding in life and dramatically reduce their chances of ending up in the prison system as well, incidentally lowering crime rates and creating fewer dangerous areas where cops are likely to be shot on the job, etc.

&gt;this does not necessarily mean they are qualified to review pre-clinical data, toxicology, manufacturing/CMC/QA data. How much clinical trial experience do these academics even have? How much regulatory experience do they have? Approving a drug or vaccine goes way beyond just reviewing a journal article. Do they understand data integrity? Can they ensure human ethics were preserved during the trial conduct? Are they going to perform site audits at the clinical trial sites around the world and make sure the data are real and validated like the FDA would similarly audit?

ok. here's the list, and their academic pedigrees... ***which of these individuals lack the necessary qualifications?***

* Chairman Dr. Arthur L. Reingold, the Division Head of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the **UC Berkeley,** School of Public Health.
* Dr. Tomás Aragón, the Health Officer of City &amp; County of San Francisco, and Director of the Population Health Division at the **San Francisco Department of Public Health.**
* Ambassador Eric Goosby is a Distinguished Professor of Medicine and Director of the Center for Global Health Delivery, Diplomacy and Economics, Institute for Global Health Sciences, at the **University of California, San Francisco.**
* Dr. Rodney Hood, the president and founder of the Multicultural Health Foundation and the past president of the National Medical Association and a Board Trustee of Alliance Healthcare Foundation.
* Dr. Nicola P. Klein, a senior research scientist at the **Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division** of Research, and director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center.
* Dr. Grace Lee, a professor of pediatrics specializing in infectious diseases at the **Lucile Salter Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford.**
* Dr. Yvonne (Bonnie) Maldonado, a professor and Chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases, **Department of Pediatrics at Stanford Medicine.**
* Dr. Mark Sawyer, an infectious disease specialist at Rady Children’s Hospital and a professor of clinical pediatrics at **UC San Diego** and the medical director of the UC San Diego San Diego Immunization Partnership.
* Dr. Rob Schechter, **Chief of California Department of Public Health’s** Immunization Branch.
* Dr. Peter Szilagyi, a pediatric health services and **clinical researcher at UCLA** with an overall mission to improve access to health care, quality of care, and health outcomes for children.
* Dr. Matt Zahn, the Medica**l Director of the Division of Epidemiology and Assessment for the Orange County Health Care Agency.** He served as chair for the Immunization Advisory Workgroup for the National Association of County and City Health Officials from 2009 to 2012.

&gt;I am interested to see what the actual plan is to implement this Safety Review Workgroup and if they actually will determine the pre-clinical and clinical trial data are sound or if this is just a political stunt that will delay vaccine rollout and end up in extra deaths.
