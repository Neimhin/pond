Come fall and winter, many of us in the South like to go outside because we can without immediately melting in a puddle of sweat. It doesn’t get so cold (at least not for long periods) that we can’t go out and enjoy the outdoors, which you would think leads to less spread of Covid.

I think that is fine.  I think that might be necessary.  I was one of those people that had the attitude of, ""politics, you leave me alone, and I'll leave you alone"".  As a minority though, I've been watching with increasing concern about the direction our country is taking, and some policies, as well as our President's statements, have made realize that sooner or later, all of this stuff will affect me.  

You know, sometime a few months ago, maybe late last year or maybe last summer even, I started to say the phrase, ""and vote like your life depends on it.  Because it does."" to those who I felt comfortable speaking politics with.  I was a bit stunned to start hearing that in random places.  I think I heard Jon Oliver say that, and Michelle Obama definitely says that twice.  

I don't think we should leave politicians alone, ever.  Even if they're our own people, we should be watching them closely with neutral eyes.  If anything, the last four years have been a total destruction of good faith and the social contract for me.  These people, the politicians, are put in a position of power and authority.

[],,captainstormy,,,[],,,,text,t2_9cdmh,False,False,[],"So I worked from home for 13 years.  Then when I needed to change jobs in 2019 companies seemed to be hating on WFH and I had to go into an office.  And now with COVID I've been back home.  I've seen it all, so let me share my thoughts.

It basically comes down to four things.

First is distractions.  

For the most part, you can ignore and avoid distractions at home.  Tell the friends and family not to bother you, shut the pets out of the home office, just sit down and focus on work.  I can't control distractions at the office.  I've always got some people coming by that want me to help them with their work and take me away from my work.  I've got people coming by that want to talk.  I can't just go pee and grab a cup of coffee in 1 minute, I end up having to have conversations with people and waste even more time.  etc etc.  

Second is happiness.

Happy employees are more focused and work harder.  Working from home makes many employees happier for lots of different reasons.   For some, it's not having the commute.  For some it's not having to wake up early and put on work clothes.  For some it's the ability to go outside and work on the patio on nice days, or have a cigar at their desk while they work.  Whatever the reason, many employees are happier working from home.

Third is better collaboration options.  

Being the new guy at my company, I'm trying to learn a whole lot of stuff from a whole lot of people.  It can kinda be harder in the office for a few reasons.  With tools like teams, zoom, webex, etc etc we can all see what the others are doing, guide each other through processes, etc etc.  In person, it typically ends up with a couple of guys crowded around on PC and one guy doing it all.  Combine that with less distractions (more guys equals more people trying to distract them) and it's just better.

Fourth, is better/more comfortable equipment.

At home I have a private office.  In my private office I have a window to open to get some fresh air on nice days.  I control the lights and temperature to my own liking.  I've got my own coffee machine with the exact coffee I like.  I've got a mini fridge filled with the soda I like.  I've got a water cooler with spring water (which to  me tastes a thousand times better than filtered water).  

I've also got an amazing Lazy-Boy computer chair.  A huge oversized L shaped desk.  I've got my own computer with an i9 processor, 64GB of RAM and super fast NVME hard drives.  I've got 6 32 inch monitors hooked up to my PC.  I've got an amazing mechanical keyboard and a wonderful track ball.  My desk also adjusts between sitting and standing when I want to stretch my legs.  

At work, I sit in a cheap office chair in a cramped cubical using 2 20 inch monitors and a cheapo keyboard and mouse.  The office lights are hella bright (I'm not the only one who complains about it) and the building is always either too hot or too cold.  The laptop they give to work off of has a low end core i5 and 8gm of ram with the cheapest slowest ssd on the planet.  

I'm not only less comfortable in the office, but I'm using worse equipment.

The poor will be doing most of the dying. So yeah, totally in their benefit to reopen everything

And yet many poor do indeed believe that...

I have this built up rage inside me that just refuses to subside for months now, due to how this was all so successfully spun as ""Those detached from reality public health experts want to take away your job over a mild flu nothingburger. Blame it all on them"". And many ordinary people fully bought into that message. 

When the reality is exactly the opposite -- the corporate oligarchy refuses to do what has to be done to eliminate the virus because it means making unacceptable even on a temporary basis concessions:

1. You need to lockdown hard.

2. Which means profits cease for a while, but more importantly, it means you need to give people helicopter money so that they don't starve

3. And most importantly, you need to cancel their debts, because they can't pay them without a job

4. You also need to place the corporations under direct governmental control so that their productive capacity is directed towards dealing with the crisis rather than extorting everyone that is susceptible to such extortion for maximum profits

5. And you need to have free testing, healthcare and paid sick leave so that you don't have infected and sick people walking about and going to work, spreading the virus all around them

None of that is in any way accetable even on a temporary basis -- it directly threatens the very foundations of the neoliberal order of the last 40+ years. 

The death of millions was a price they were perfectly willing to pay. After all it is poor people and old people who are doing most of the dying. And the old people dying is a benefit -- it reduces the expenses on pensions and healthcare, so that means more money available to funnel into the pockets of the rich. 

And all of this is crystal clear to everyone with the eyes to see

See? This is why you're supposed to listen to the *scientists*, not the *politicians*! Because politicians *never* know as much about the pandemic and the virus as scientists do. 

And so they make *really* unrealistic and chimerical promises to keep the morale and compliance of the public high, such as ""15 days to stop the spread"", ""next year will be better"", or ""we will return to normal at (whatever date)"" (in this case, Christmas). But all the scientists have long agreed upon and accepted as *fact* that no, this *will* take much longer than two weeks; yes, things *will* still end up getting cancelled in 2021 as well (Coachella, BlizzCon, Broadway, you name it); and *no*, we are *not* returning to ""old normal"".

OCS put it best, emphasizing that even when the vaccine is out and it all *seems* to be over, we are *not* ""going back to brunch"" and pretending that COVID-19 is eradicated. Because it won't be. Russia saw their highest single-day spike yesterday, even *with* a vaccine in EUA.

If politicians are your primary source of COVID-19 information, then I *seriously* recommend that you find some *more qualified* experts to listen to. They are *almost definitely* going to shift the goalposts. Of course they will; they're *politicians*! Yes, it might seem like scientists also do that, but at least *they* are forgiven, because they're dealing with a constantly evolving novel disease pandemic situation. Their message might not always be pleasant (which is partly responsible for too many common folk ignoring them), but what they say tends to be more objective, consistent, and reliable, and less partisan and biased, than what politicians say.

[],,atealein,,,[],,,,text,t2_zj96m,False,True,[],"Denmark had a small bump in positive cases in late July, but it stabilized and went down in late August. The bump at the height of it was half-the spring cases, and when it went down it didn't go down to the early June numbers, but stayed still elevated. The new increase since the start of September is considerably larger than that one - reaching twice the spring numbers by the end of September. It has since gone down, but is still more than the spring numbers. 

(I use spring numbers as comparison, but got to note that those numbers in all countries were dependent on the limited testing capacity, so there might have been more infected than tested)  

Sweden similarly to Denmark had a small uptick in August, followed by a drop in September and is now increasing. It still hasn't passed the number of cases in spring (when testing was limited to severe cases and health care staff) or the higher peak in June (when testing opened up to everyone even with mild symptoms). 

In that sense both countries saw small bumps at similar time and then decrease and then increase again. Difference for me is that in Denmark the increase is much more significant and accompanied by increase in hospitalizations and deaths too. Saying that Sweden is month or two behind doesn't make sense - especially since the significant increase in Denmark started at the start of September, Sweden is maybe two weeks after that. Denmark saw increase in hospitalizations arising around 10th of September and that has maybe hit plateau only in the last few days. Deaths definitely increased since mid-September too. In Sweden both deaths and ICU admissions are at the same low levels - ICU admissions have had the same low level since July, deaths are at this low level since end of August (they were higher before).",,,1602326903,{},g8azqjw,True,t3_j7y0w1,False,True,t1_g8axg17,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j7y0w1/sweden_public_health_authority_update_98451_919/g8azqjw/,1602326913,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Not sufficiently. 

A proper lock down is as harsh and as prolonged as necessary to get the cases down to zero.

Only China, Vietnam, NZ and Australia seem to get it. 

In the West everyone reopened while still having hundreds of cases, and in the case of the US, while having tens of thousands and on the rise in many states

&gt;What were nations supposed to do? Keep locked down crippling the economy, jobs, businesses, peoples education etc because of a few hundred cases a day?

They were supposed to eliminate the virus. 

Of course, we should always step back to before things got out of control -- they should have never allowed it to get out of control in the first place. But that wasn't done. Why? Because stopping international travel would have ""hurt the economy"". Well, what did not stopping it achieve exactly?

Which illustrates the broader point -- with this combination of contagiousness and morbidity (and we should add the lack of lasting immunity, which most people still stubbornly refuse to accept as a real possibility even though the evidence is right there in their faces) you cannot have an ""economy"". 

But let's look at it even more broadly. Whose ""economy"" are we talking about? The one in which the last 50 years have been spent taking from the poor and giving to the rich, and in which we were accelerating on the path towards neofeudalism? What is the benefit in preserving that system for the average person?

&gt;When you say the death of millions was a price ""they"" were willing to pay, who are ""they""? Every government in the world basically?

There are very few actual ""governments"" in the world. The battle between the state and the capitalist oligarchy in most of the world has long been decisively won by the latter. Which is a big reason why the West was completely incapacitated in the face of an serious crisis -- you need functioning government to deal with such a crisis, but having a functioning government means a center of power competing with oligarchical economic interests. Which is why the latter have for millennia worked to undermine central authority. With neoliberalism they struck gold -- not only was it adopted in practice, but it also provided an ideological justification for the resulting arrangement the likes of which there had not been since the Middle Ages (and even then the king was supposedly above the nobility). 

&gt;This has always been an issue of balancing deaths from covid/ knock on negative affects from lockdown i.e job losses, business shutting down, increased state reliance, less cancer screening, kids not going to school etc. To act like this is all evil rich people trying to make more money and kill poor people is such a novice way to look at it.

How many times does it have to be explained that there is no such balance to be had?

You have the choice of having no virus and a healthy economy or the choice of letting the virus run rampant through the population killing the economy in the process. 

The reason the rich are to blame is that they decided that it was in their interest to use the crisis to grab control over an even larger share of the economy even if it shrinks, because if they were to try to eliminate the virus, they would have had to do the opposite -- cede some of their control over society. 

&gt;Do you really think world leaders are sitting around thinking ""great, 50,000 pensions might die, that'll do wonder for balancing our books"", you really think 10s of thousands of pensioners would make much of a difference to any governments books?

They are not thinking ""great, 50,000 pensions might die"", they are thinking ""Great, a several million will die and overall life expectancy will be reduced by 10 years"". 

&gt;Also how do they funnel that money?

How do you explain the fact that they all wanted to get tested and all wore masks there? Now can I say 100% of orthodox people wear masks?

Obviously not. Don’t generalize entire groups of people just bc it seems like that’s the case. You would never generalize entire groups of people based on race, so why is it ok to do it here based on religion?

Another experience I had: 3 orthodox Jewish boys were sitting together outside and 2 separate guys came up to yell at them about “their communities”. These kids were wearing masks and distanced from everyone else. This type of lazy generalization leads to hatred against entire communities like this, which I’m sure has helped contribute to the increase in antisemitic hate crimes.

Show me anything that shows it matters.  I'd love to see evidence of long term coronavirus immunity.  Got the full text? 

&gt;  Reinfection is not as scary as it sounds. Let me put it this way, just because it can happen, doesn't mean its relevant to 99% of people. 

We have no idea what the reinfection rate it is, we haven't hit a year since people's last infections so it's impossible to say.  What we do know is that reinfection among front line workers isn't hugely uncommon, and they are documented to often have worse infections.  These are often healthy individuals, not the immunocompromised.

&gt;  For a lot of viruses 

Do we know of a single coronavirus with long term immunity?  I'd love a citation. 

 &gt;  One study found that if reinfection was happening with everybody after 4 months at the same rate of normal infections, there would be about 150k reinfections in the USA right now. Instead we have... 2 confirmed cases of reinfection worldwide.

2 cases of reinfection?  India front line workers alone have over 6 confirmed reinfections last I checked.   https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/oct/07/covid-second-infection-can-be-worse-than-first-for-some-shows-study-2207097.html

I also never said 4 months was the time line for immunity to wear off, although that is somewhat consistent with other coronaviruses.  That also seems like it would be inferring that people who got sick once would stop doing measures to prevent getting sick again, something we haven't actually seen.

**The spread of infection is gaining new momentum in Sweden, and in healthcare there is an increase in the number of patients being treated for covid-19.                      
""The situation is very, very serious"", says Karin Tegmark Wisell at the Swedish Public Health Agency.**
                           
                           
During Thursday's press conference, the Swedish Public Health Agency reported no further deaths among people with confirmed covid-19 in Sweden. But the spread of infection is gaining momentum. At present, the proportion of positive tests among those tested is 2.9 per cent - a proportion that has increased steadily in recent weeks.              
                           
  *""Last week we were at 2.4 percent and the week before that at 1.6 percent""*, says Karin Tegmark Wisell.                
                           
In Uppsala , for example, there are signs of an extra sharp increase.                      
                           
  *""We also do not see signs of the possible slowdown you can see in Skåne and Stockholm""*, says Karin Tegmark Wisell.                    
                           
When it comes to the number of people receiving hospital care for covid-19, it is so far a matter of comparatively low numbers, according to the National Board of Health and Welfare's compilation. At present, 25 people are cared for with covid-19 in intensive care, and 152 infected people are cared for in other wards. But the trend is increasing there as well.                                  
                                
  *""We see a slight increase in people being cared for for covid-19 in healthcare""*, says Mattias Fredricson, unit manager at the National Board of Health and Welfare.             
                                  
On Thursday , the message came that the restrictions on the number of people who may gather at public gatherings are not eased, something Karin Tegmark Wisell justifies with the increased spread of infection.               
*""Now we see that the situation is very, very serious with regions that have an increasing spread of infection and we also hear from the National Board of Health and Welfare that there has been a slight increase in the burden in healthcare""*, she says.           
  *""Then it is not time to lighten up in any way.""*
                                      
**Does this mean that we will instead see stricter measures throughout the country?**
                            
  *""It is important that we really think the whole thing before we go out with new recommendations, so that it becomes appropriate. Our mission is to look at public health as a whole, and there we see that there are consequences that are extremely negative. The coin always has two sides""*, says Karin Tegmark Wisell.                       
                           
She mentions the restraining order on nursing homes as an example of how restrictions can have negative consequences in other ways.                 
                                 
**It is soon autumn break and people are planning trips. Can it be relevant to reintroduce travel restrictions in the country?**                      
                               
  *""We may be forced to go back to situations we had before. We try not to have to back down too much, but it is possible to reconsider decisions on reliefs that have been made"", says Tegmark Wisell.                                      
Earlier in the day, the Swedish Public Health Agency presented the possibility of introducing different types of local measures in different parts of the country.                                     
  *""The legislation can not be different, it is national. However, in these general guidelines that we have sent out for consultation, the purpose is to clarify what we see as the tools that are most suitable to use in this situation""*, says Tegmark Wisell.                       

**Can a region then introduce binding rules locally, or are these recommendations?**             
                       
  *""A general advice is linked to legislation, in this case the Infection Control Act. If compliance is poor, you can move higher up the scale in terms of introducing clearer restrictions""*, says Tegmark Wisell.                                   
She emphasizes that the Swedish strategy is based on an understanding of the situation and that the individual is seen as a responsible person, she continues.               
               
  *""The first step in a staircase is to go that way""*, says Karin Tegmark Wisell.
                           
**Facts: Number of dead and infected**              
A total of 97,532 people have been confirmed infected with covid-19 in Sweden.                       
To date, 5,892 of those infected have died.                         
25 people receive intensive care for covid-19 and another 152 people are cared for in other hospital wards.

[],,helembad,,,[],,,,text,t2_s0xb5,False,False,[],"&gt;It is entirely applicable: close borders, lock down until cases go to zero.

That's not the problem. The problem is SUSTAINING that zero.

Pretty much every European country simply cannot afford to keep borders closed long-term. It is unthinkable and highly impractical - cross-border communications and exchanges are just way too intense. For countries like Netherlands or Germany, keeping borders closed for prolonged periods of time would pretty much destroy their economy. It's not an exaggeration, keeping borders open in the EU nowadays is absolutely vital for its economy to actually function. That's not the case for New Zealand - they don't even have any land borders.

With that in mind, you can bring your cases down to zero, but unless your neighbours also have all zero cases and are not bringing in ANYONE from third countries with covid cases, as soon as you re-open your borders...the virus is just gonna be back with a vengeance. And then it's just gonna be worse, because you'll no longer be able to enforce a hard lockdown like you did the first time (because it wouldn't be economically and socially sustainable) and you still won't have eradicated the virus. Basically you'll have suffered all the negative consequences of a lockdown without gaining shit.

Eradication only works if you can afford to effectively cut yourself off from the rest of the world and quarantine everyone entering indefinitely. Plus, bar a Wuhan-style lockdown, it is extremely hard (read: nearly impossible) to actually reach zero cases once the virus is no longer confined to a few isolated outbreaks. NZ, Taiwan, China or South Korea had that option. Europe did not. It COULD have had it if

a. EVERY european country had locked itself down at the same time when virus circulation was still very low (as in, no later than mid-February)

None of them with as intense and economically relevant exchanges as any random internal EU border. Import-export flows between France and Germany are about as large as Vietnam's total GDP.

It would be comparable if, say, South Korea and China or Japan shared a land border with billions of euros of exports a day between the two and thousands of people commuting in and out (not to mention tourism). But they don't.

Btw, I never mentioned population density. I don't think that's a huge factor, or at least not in the way people usually understand it.

&gt;Outdoor recreational activity was allowed under Level 4, but it was just walking around the block.

That wasn't allowed in Italy. It got banned after a huge campaign against runners (to the point that it became a meme). I know people who wouldn't dare to walk around the block at 2 AM because they were scared of police fines. And the other restrictions you listed applied as well. 

I think that Spain was around the same level, IIRC for most of June people could only leave their homes at specific times during the day depending on their age.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not downplaying the severity of NZ's lockdown, especially considering its relatively low infection rate at the time. I'm just saying it likely wasn't the toughest in the developed world.

&gt;NZ is geographically isolated, but that's irrelevant when you have international air travel.

International air travel where you can check and quarantine every single person coming in - many EU countries also check people flying in. It's an entirely different story when you have tens of thousands of people coming in every day by train or car or foot - people that are vital for companies to keep running. So yeah, it's extremely relevant.

&gt;Choosing to keep our borders closed long-term was just as painful a decision as any European country would have faced.

Not really. In many European cities, for example, closing borders literally means that factories cannot produce because they cannot receive their components supply as quickly as they need, not to mention how much more expensive the whole process would get. It would wreak havoc on the entire continental industry. It's not uncommon for European regions to have more intense exchanges with regions from neighbouring countries than with other regions in their own country. Have you ever wondered why Switzerland, which is not an EU member, still allows free travel from all its neighbours?

Again, don't get me wrong, I admire NZ's response. It was excellent.

In most of Europe, strict 14-day quarantines are slapped on all contacts of infected people and anyone who travels to some parts of Europe. Sweden’s quarantine, however, is for seven days and only for those who live with an infected person. If a test on day five is negative, the quarantine can end then. Children with no symptoms are exempt from quarantine. All other contacts are simply alerted that they may be infected. They are urged to work from home for a week, to get tested if they have even the slightest symptoms in the next 14 days, and to be extra careful about seeing elderly relatives in that period.

&gt;The World Health Organisation bristles at quarantines shorter than 14 days. But the Swedish approach is to have measures that people can live with for at least a year, says Dr Carlson, because there is no vaccine yet. The goal is to stop as much transmission as possible without unduly disrupting people’s lives, especially in ways that harm their mental or physical (not to mention economic) health. Transmission happens most easily within households, and people are most contagious in the first week after they are infected. So Sweden’s quarantine policy could stop the bulk of covid’s spread—as long as people comply.

&gt;They probably will. A cash payment is available for quarantined people who cannot work from home, such as taxi drivers. The government pays for antibody tests for anyone who wants one. A positive antibody test exempts you from quarantine and the hassle of getting tested for covid if you have a cold or flu-like sniffle. All these measures look a lot laxer than the other systems across Europe. But whether by doing less Sweden ends up achieving more will become clear only in the next few months. 

This is the Swedish way. Recommend effective and balanced measures rather than excessive and draconian measures, educate the population and give economic support to the affected (paid sick leave up to three weeks without a doctors note) and people will do their best to follow them, voluntarily. Let’s hope it will work again.",,,1602344705,{},g8bzast,False,t3_j8m94w,False,True,t3_j8m94w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8m94w/how_sweden_hopes_to_prevent_a_second_wave_of/g8bzast/,1602344882,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

In Ischgl and the diamond princess case, 80% were asymptomatic.

The IFR is very sensitive to the thoroughness of testing and the accuracy not recording the COD. It's probably why there's so much variation.

There's a major issue with sensitivity of antibody tests, where the blood tests miss way more people that mucosa tests pick up, and a lot of IFR is looking at the blood tests results.

But these aren't looking at Africa, for fur some reason seems to be just shrugging it off (very young population, more non urban, high UV, etc). A lot of the number of infected but not sick might be from Africa.

There's also the fact numbers coming from China re deaths are unreliable, same for places like NK.

Mortality in some areas like the UK and Sweden seems to be inflated by the fact that we had a really mild influenza season last year, which would have left tens of thousands of elderly people only with us until the first nasty respiratory virus hit them.

My advice is to look at places that have been through this, and has it just die out (herd immunity for the time being).

Ischgl had its outbreak in Feb and March, combined antibody tests put the number of positive at 42%. My feeling is that it was a touch higher and the tests missed a few, but it's kind of moot to my next point.

Out of 1.7k they had two deaths (before we understood about steroids and positioning). That's a community mortality of 1/850, during the depths if winter when vitamin D was lowest, and when we had no idea how to treat it.

My feeling is that we should be looking at a community mortality of around 1/1000, maybe a touch less, for the whole year, with the IFR probably landing at around 0.25% total.

You can't.

We need a change of leadership. Some of us hate Trump, some of us don't. But when you boil it down to just the pure facts, politics aside, its clear that we need a change in leadership in America.

Join me in voting Trump out of office this month (early voting) and finalize it on Election Day, Tuesday, November 3.

**Early in-person voting** can allow you to avoid the issues with USPS election mail while still avoiding possible long lines or large crowds on election day.

If you still plan to vote via absentee / mail-in ballot, **most states allow you to drop off your completed ballot at your local Board of Election or one of their official drop boxes instead of mailing it**. This is a great way to avoid worrying about if the USPS will deliver it in time or not.

Same as every other country, unless governed by a totalitarian dictatorship that can react to outbreaks by literally shutting down the country and involuntarily locking people in their homes or inside quarantine camps (like China and Vietnam), then countries need to approach this thing much more proactively.

Additionally, I would have preferred to let Tara Reade have her say, but that all was quashed by the media.  I find him personally kind of creepy, as it seems he is still stuck in the 1990s when it comes to sexist behavior.

I agree with Yang's assessment that Trump is a symptom of a disease in our country, and I think that Biden will not work to mitigate that.  I fear we will end up with Trump 2.0, or someone even worse in 2024.  

Biden will work to maintain the status quo, and while I will appreciate a return to normalcy, I feel so much is lacking in our country to support equality.  We are in dire need of social evolution, and if we do not make steps in that direction, I fear it will further destabilize our nation.

The switch from RT-PCR to CT scans as positive confirmation on Feb 12th was a major step in China curbing the epidemic. CT scans are decidedly less accurate than RT-PCR but the advantage is that you never overwhelm the testing capacity as you're using your existing CT infrastructure.

The most recent discussion I have been able to find is [this article in Stat News](https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/16/ct-scans-alternative-to-inaccurate-coronavirus-tests/) in April and then just nothing. Like, there's no articles that are like, ""Here's what we've learnt since April that proves CT scans shouldn't be used"", they just dropped off the map of discussion.

Now, even in retrospective analyses of China's success, we've forgotten that they used CT scans as an adjunct to ensure they never faced the overwhelming of their test capacity which was a key part of the response.

Again, it's probably because other countries can use CT scans so if it's possible, it must not be a part of China's response.

Clinical Trial of Ivermectin Plus Doxycycline for the Treatment of Confirmed Covid-19 Infection

Dr. Reaz Mahmud, Dhaka Medical College


Summary:

- 183 patients in ivermectin+doxycycline (plus standard of care) arm - Ivermectin 6mg x 2 tablets = 12mg (given once i.e. total 12mg dose) - Doxycycline 100mg x 2 tablets/day (given for 5 days i.e. total 1000mg dose)

- 180 patients in placebo arm (standard of care)

----

Ivermectin+Doxycycline arm had:

- older demographic (usually do worse)

- more males (usually do worse)

----

Mortality:

- 0 deaths in ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 3 deaths in placebo arm

- (i.e. placebo did worse)

----

Number of Patients With Early Clinical Improvement (at 7 days):

- 60.7% patients in ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 44.4% patients in placebo arm

- p value &lt; 0.03

- (i.e. placebo did worse)

----

Number of Participants With Late Clinical Recovery (requiring more than 14 days to recover):

- 23% patients in ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 37.2% patients in placebo arm

- p value &lt; 0.004

- (i.e. placebo did worse)

----

Number of Patients Having Clinical Deterioration (1 month):

- 8.7% patients in ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 17.8% patients in placebo arm

- p value &lt; 0.013

- (i.e. placebo did worse)

----

Number of Patients Remain Persistently Positive for RT-PCR of Covid-19 (at day 14):

- 7.7% patients in ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 20.0% patients in placebo arm

- p value &lt; 0.001

- (i.e. placebo did worse)

----

Adverse Events:

- 2 patients had gastrointestinal issues (Erosive esophagitis) in ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 0 patients in placebo arm


Minor adverse events:

- 7 patients had gastrointestinal issues (Non ulcer Dyspepsia) in ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 0 patients in placebo arm

----


Takeaways:

- Ivermectin + Doxycycline had better outcomes

- Ivermectin dose was only 6mg x 2 tablets = 12mg (given once) - which is at the lower end of dosage for covid-19 (although it is typical for de-worming).  Other studies have typically used 2x or 3x this dosage or higher.  Also it is not clear if Ivermectin was taken with a fatty meal (which ivermectin spec sheet gives 2.5x bioavailability when taken with fatty meal).

- Results are better than what we have seen for Remdesivir etc. - yet are getting scant attention (also lower interest in clinical trials by pharma since being generic drugs there is little financial incentive).  Most of the work on Ivermectin is thus coming from outside the U.S./Europe (Bangladesh, Peru, Egypt).",,,1602316323,{},g8aph5p,True,t3_j8gk31,False,True,t3_j8gk31,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8gk31/clinical_trial_of_ivermectin_plus_doxycycline_for/g8aph5p/,1602316334,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

That is not democracy that's a minority rule that gives rural voters ALL the power. And they've shown they're far more aligned with fascist government than their urban counterparts. They show it time and time again.

Why would Republican politicians EVER concede to participate in a process that would reduce their power?

They never will, ever. They KNOW they rely on voter suppression, gerrymandering and the power of rural votes in the Senate to maintain power. They're craven and unscrupulous but not stupid. What benefit is there for them to participate in amending the constitution to make our system of government MORE representative of the overall population?

It will HAVE to be done in spite of them they will NEVER concede to participate broadening voting rights.

Your current view about China and the Chinese people are a result of your country's propaganda.

Look, even our news media is selling us propaganda:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.economist.com/china/2018/10/04/why-protests-are-so-common-in-china

Read the sub-headline. ""China's protests are rarely political...""

Umm, protests of ANY kind IS political. 

As I understand it, Chinese people do elect their leaders. In very simple terms, they elect local politicians who then elect other prepresentatives who then elect their President. They don't choose their top official.

In America, in simple terms, we elect our local rep who then join a party, and that party decides who is to be elected for President. We choose between a set of officials that have been preseleted for us.

In the UK, you elect a local official who joins a party, and that party decides who becomes the top official, Prime Minister. British prople don't choose their top official.

The real difference is in the relationship between your officials and the people.

Incidentally, Singapore is a democratic country. It is based off the British system where citizens vote for local officials who form a party and that party forms the government and elect the Prime Minister. 

The relationship between the government and the people is similar to China's relationship to the people where after electing local officials, they trust the government to then perform and take care of them and national interests.

In the West, the relationship between people and government is adversarial, meaning neither trusts each other. The political involvement of citizens is due to this distrust and a misalignment of what career politicians want for themselves and what the people want. You have low trust in your governments, that is why you are political.

China and many Asian countries have high trust in their hovernment, which reduces the necessity for political activism.

All that should matter is how good and professional you are at your job. If you happen to get along with a coworker fine and become friends that is fine, but I certainly wish work would turn back into what it actually is: a job you do to pay your bills.

The whole ""social"" aspect of work is not even helping anyone, when people get promoted because they are friends with the manager it doesn't benefit anyone, not even the company, because there might be talent somewhere in the company that would be more fitting for the promotion, but maybe is less social or less liked.

Yea but this is different.  The whole world is under the pandemic and so now even highly accredited and renowned institutions are forced to go online - I think it's safe to say that employers in the future will realize this to a good extent.  If the virus continues onward, higher institutions might even change their educational model long-term to adapt for school-from-home (I think that within 10 years or so, VR or AR technology might even allow for 'virtual classrooms' to be accessed by us from home, for example).  But due to the unprecedented nature of the virus, almost all the graduating classes of the future will have had a good amount of time studying from home and so employers almost surely won't knock them for it.

Certainly agree on the vaccines - everything seems to be going as well as it can, though of course we are waiting for definitive results that they actually work.

Reinfection does seem rare - the concern is that (if I understand correctly) each of your infections would have needed to have been sequenced, and there would need to have been sufficient differences to prove reinfection as opposed to resurgence. If we assume the worst case, where the first infection was mild, but the second more severe, then it's unlikely the first would have been sequenced (as it was mild), so we wouldn't (yet) know this was happening. There is of course the time element - what if immunity lasts a year, and the small numbers of reinfections we are seeing are just the statistical outliers?

Both outbreaks were successfully contained, but the underlying trend continued rising in the whole country. Beating down a local outbreak in Århus obviously does nothing to stop the steady increase in Copenhagen. 

The steady increase accelerated in September. At first in Copenhagen and then in the whole country.

Privacy, though! South Korea's app (IIRC) doesn't reveal the identity of the newly covid-positive person when it sends out the alarm to all of that person's covid-contacts. That seems like sufficient respect for privacy, to me.

They put support in Apple and Android phones, apparently:

&gt; On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems. 

Are covid-contact apps being used in the US? I haven't heard anything about it. 

If not, why not? Sounds easy to do, and a really effective way to do contact management, much cheaper and much much more accurate than having contract tracers asking people to recall who they've been around during their infectious period, which could be many days before they find out they're positive. The Michael Mina thesis is that current contact tracing is almost useless because people *seldom* find out that they're covid+ during their most-infectious period, which might begin a couple days before any symptoms show up.

I would feel safer if my phone would beep a warning when I was in proximity of a person who should be isolating because they have been in contact with a covid+ person within the last 14 days. I want my phone to give a *klaxon* sound when I'm within 10 feet of a person who has tested covid+ in the last 2-4 weeks.

To be fully effective, it would require universal adoption, though. Maybe an app could serve as a weak golden ticket. As I enter a grocery store or restaurant, for example:

&gt; Sir, I need to verify that you haven't been in contact with anyone covid+ recently. Show me your covidContacts app, please.

That would be an incentive to install the app, if people don't want to install it to avoid the virus, and and aren't concerned about spreading the virus. 

Maybe have people pass through a gate that checks the status of the app, as they enter the store.",,,1602298074,{},g8a3oqh,True,t3_j8cfqo,False,True,t3_j8cfqo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8cfqo/covid19_apps_wikipedia/g8a3oqh/,1602298140,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

&gt;The order would have been the toughest federal mandate to date aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus, which continues to infect more than 40,000 Americans a day. The officials said that it was drafted under the agency’s “quarantine powers” and that it had the support of the secretary of health and human services, Alex M. Azar II, but the White House Coronavirus Task Force, led by Vice President Mike Pence, declined to even discuss it.

Pence didn’t want to discuss it for whatever reason. But we know how his boss feels about masks.

We have 14 deaths per DAY - independent of COVID - from respiratory infections of various types. 

It's always easy to look at the news and find this one case - but, frankly, that's like showing me the car accident where a person loses both arms and legs and their genitals and their vision.......or something like that....and saying ""see? you shouldn't drive"". 

We simply cannot use the word ""deadly""  (for me compared to other things) now that we know what we know-among the healthy population under 70.

The numbers I am giving you are right from the State and MA. is very good in public health. 

No doubt there is a bit of a trolley problem here. So, how many years of the relatively short rest of my life is it worth waiting....assuming that, for most, re-infection is unlikely and/or weak? If you were 65 years old would you trade 5 years of not seeing your children and grandchildren and not ""living in full""? Remember, the odds increase each day of dying anyway and they increase vastly as far as getting conditions that make life much more difficult.

They still say that people should specifically only wear cloth face coverings.

[Effect of Hydroxychloroquine in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022926)

The abstract is copied here:

&gt; **BACKGROUND**
&gt;
&gt; Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been proposed as treatments for corona-virus disease 2019 (Covid-19) on the basis of in vitro activity and data from uncon-trolled studies and small, randomized trials.
&gt;
&gt;**METHODS**
&gt;
&gt;In this randomized, controlled, open-label platform trial comparing a range of pos-sible treatments with usual care in patients hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned 1561 patients to receive hydroxychloroquine and 3155 to receive usual care. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.
&gt;
&gt; **RESULTS**
&gt;
&gt; The enrollment of patients in the hydroxychloroquine group was closed on June 5, 2020, after an interim analysis determined that there was a lack of efficacy. Death within 28 days occurred in 421 patients (27.0%) in the hydroxychloroquine group and in 790 (25.0%) in the usual-care group (rate ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence inter-val  [CI],  0.97  to  1.23;  P  =   0.15).  Consistent  results  were  seen  in  all  prespecified  subgroups of patients. The results suggest that patients in the hydroxychloroquine group were less likely to be discharged from the hospital alive within 28 days than those in the usual-care group (59.6% vs. 62.9%; rate ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.98). Among the patients who were not undergoing mechanical ventilation at baseline, those in the hydroxychloroquine group had a higher frequency of invasive mechani-cal ventilation or death (30.7% vs. 26.9%; risk ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.27). There was a small numerical excess of cardiac deaths (0.4 percentage points) but no difference in the incidence of new major cardiac arrhythmia among the patients who received hydroxychloroquine.
&gt;
&gt; **CONCLUSIONS**

But Ivermectin has been reported on by numerous youtube doctors like Medcram (Dr Seheult), Dr Mike Hansen, Dr Been - over many months - you can find their reporting on it on youtube.


Check out the recent Egypt study as well (Zagazig Univ) which is even more compelling since it directly addresses home transmission (7.4pct family members got covid19-like symptoms vs 58pct in the non-intervention arm).

See? This is why you're supposed to listen to the *scientists*, not the *politicians*! Because politicians *never* know as much about the pandemic and the virus as scientists do. 

And so they make *really* unrealistic and chimerical promises to keep the morale and compliance of the public high, such as ""15 days to stop the spread"", ""next year will be better"", or ""we will return to normal at (whatever date)"" (in this case, Christmas). But all the scientists have long agreed upon and accepted as *fact* that no, this *will* take much longer than two weeks; yes, things *will* still end up getting cancelled in 2021 as well (Coachella, BlizzCon, Broadway, you name it); and *no*, we are *not* returning to ""old normal"".

OCS put it best, emphasizing that even when the vaccine is out and it all *seems* to be over, we are *not* ""going back to brunch"" and pretending that COVID-19 is eradicated. Because it won't be. Russia saw their highest single-day spike yesterday, even *with* a vaccine in EUA.

If politicians are your primary source of COVID-19 information, then I *seriously* recommend that you find some *more qualified* experts to listen to. They are *almost definitely* going to shift the goalposts. Of course they will; they're *politicians*! Yes, it might seem like scientists also do that, but at least *they* are forgiven, because they're dealing with a constantly evolving novel disease pandemic situation. Their message might not always be pleasant (which is partly responsible for too many common folk ignoring them), but what they say tends to be more objective, consistent, and reliable, and less partisan and biased, than what politicians say. 

And so, you should listen to *science*, not *politics*.

It’s not even a slogan. It goes back a long ways. 

Early 1800s Phillepe Pinel began his own multiyear clinical study to show that people left untreated got better on predictable timed schedules.

&gt;In medicine it is difficult to come to any agreement if a precise meaning is not given to the word ""experiment"", since everyone vaunts their own results, and only more or less cites the facts in factor of their point of view. However, to be genuine and conclusive, an serve as a solid basis for any method of treatment, an experiment must be carried out on a large number of patients following the same rules and a set order. It must also be based on a consistent series of observations recorded very carefully and repeated over a number a certain number of years in a regular manner. Finally it must equally report both events, which are favorable and those which are not, quoting their respective numbers, and it must attach as much importance to one set of data as to the other. In a nutshell it must be based on the theory of probabilities, which is already so effectively applied to several questions in civil lif and on which from no on methods of treating illnesses must also rely if one wishes to establish these on sound ground. This was the goal I set myself in 1802 in relation to mental alienation when the treatment of deranged patients was entrusted to my care and transferred to the Salpetrriere.""

Sweden opted to keep its economy open, using the same logic as Nabarro. The result has been a Covid19 death toll five to ten times higher than Sweden's neighbors, whilst the economic result has been a crap economy that might as well have been closed down.

But I'd say as long as the demographic of the patients in the hospital doesn't change and the number don't climb too high so that we have enough beds (and nurses who can operate those) the percentage may stay the same.

There'll likely be more patients because we'll have higher numbers than before, BUT hospital staff learned a lot regarding stuff that works.
Oxygen treatment for example has different patterns afaik. Also certain meds and earlier hospilisation make a difference.

It really depends on occupancy though. If triage comes into play there'll likely be more. It may also have an effect if critically ill patients have to be flown to a different hospital if the nearest one is full.

The second issue is that people were just fed up with doing everything properly. Careless individuals started travelling and then they went clubbing like idiots even if they knew they had symptoms.

It would be a lot of work if I link to all the studies I've been reading over the last couple of months. The r/Coronavirus sub is already a good resource for links to studies.

Just a couple if things to take into consideration: Think about how long it took to get (more or less) rid of Polio, and that was child's play compared to SARS-CoV-2. Think about that the latter is airborne too. Think about that just producing enough doses takes many years, not to mention how long it takes to distribute it. We have to think in *decades*.

Think about the quick antibody decay (3-6 months), that means no natural herd immunity, you can get sick again pretty soon depending on how many people around you are infected (virus load) and you have to get a vaccine two to four times a year which costs a *fortune* compared to other vaccines. Most countries in this world cannot afford that. I guess you can imagine how much India is in trouble. Or most African countries (combine it with the fact that about 20% of the African population are HIV-positive too). That means a *lot* of people will die in the next decades.

Think about that SARS-CoV-2 weakens the immune system, meaning that you get more severe symptoms each time you get sick so it would be just a matter of time until you end up disabled (unable to work, think of late stage symptoms of COPD, not to mention neurological or psychological symptoms) or even die. Think about how many people will not be able to get a vaccine because they can't afford it or are anti-vaxxers.

Think about that a vaccine only helps if your immune system can produce antibodies, meaning you still need a lot of good antiviral treatment for sick and/or old people because their own bodies don't respond to the vaccine as well. Think about all the children who will not get vaccinated because developing a vaccine is a story on its own and takes an additional amount of time. Those children can still infect other people. Their grandparents, for example.

Think about that the virus can be transmitted to other mammals like cats and dogs which may cause it to spread even further (to wild life, through contaminated fecal, for example) which may close the circle to humans again. Imagine what this could mean for food production too.

Think about how much countries already fucked it up executing lockdowns or restrictions like citizens having to wear a mask or keeping distance, we already have what is now called ""Corona fatigue"", most people ""want their life back"", think it's a hoax, don't care at all or anything else, causing it only to spread further. Think about how long it took to just get at least *some* people to wear masks at least.

Think about an endless chain of incompetent and greedy people who will keep downplaying everything just to make a little more money (not knowing that they will lose a *lot* more money in the long run). Or using Covid-19 for political reasons. This will not end when vaccines will be available, it will go on and delay the production and distribution of a vaccines to some degree, which helps the virus only to spread.

That is just a small part, there is more. It's just a lot of unfortunate aspects. Combined with economical and political instability in a lot of countries that's a bad mix.

&gt; It would help if science had a solid, proven understanding of why the so-called seasonal flu is, well, seasonal. But it doesn’t. Linsey Marr, an environmental engineering researcher at Virginia Tech who studies viral transmission, notes that influenza viruses tend to hit hardest during the winter only after they become endemic—that is, continue to circulate year after year. That suggests seasonality may have something to do with the buildup of temporary immunity among much of the population to at least some strains of the flu. “You just don’t see that seasonality among new viruses,” she says.

Buildup of temporary immunity is an intriguing idea. The virus has hit different areas of the country at different times, but they mostly have a familiar bell curve of acceleration then drop-off.

 Newsweek logo At Least 9 People At Trump Campaign Rally in Minnesota Tested Positive for COVID-19, Health Officials Say
 
At least nine people who attended a rally hosted by President Donald Trump's campaign last month in Bemidji, Minnesota, later tested positive for COVID-19, state health officials said Friday.  

ump spoke with attendees at the rally, which was held outside at an airport hangar on September 18. It was one of several campaign stops that Trump made in recent months after states began loosening restrictions put in place due to the pandemic.

According to Kris Ehresmann, director of the Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Prevention and Control Division of the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), two of the nine rally attendees who tested positive were hospitalized for treatment of the virus.

""For the Bemidji rally, nine cases reported attending the rally; one case was known to be infectious,"" Ehresmann said during a Friday news conference. ""There were two hospitalizations that were associated with that—one who was in intensive care—and no deaths at this point."" She said health officials were continuing to monitor another rally that Trump held in Duluth, Minnesota, on September 30",,,1602302659,{},g8aaqbr,True,t3_j8dtmb,False,True,t3_j8dtmb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8dtmb/at_least_9_people_at_trùmp_campaign_rally_in/g8aaqbr/,1602302669,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

As I said, the city centre is super dense aside from LA (which is very similar to Auckland).  But think of it this way, NYC has 24 million in its urban area. Of those 2 million live in the ultra dense core of Manhattan and nearby. Another 6 million live in the city itself, over 20,000 per sq mile. Another 4 million live in the inner suburbs at a similar density to Auckland. But then 12 million live in much lower density suburbs, stretching out way into New Jersey, upstate NY and Conn. You may not think of these areas as NYC but they are part of its urban area, many people commute to the city from them.  

Where I grew up in Boston is the same. It was a suburb 20 minutes drive to the city but every house was on a full quarter acre  with lots of woods between neighbourhoods. Suburbs like Middleboro or Carver were only 1,000 per sq mile. 

Auckland is deceptive because it has almost no city centre, but also no outer suburbs at all. It is uniformly dense across the whole urban area with very little variation.

Why do westerners insist that other people need your help or even welcome your help?

I am from Singapore and we also have authoritarian government here. In fact we're more authoritarian than China in certain aspects. Many of what China is doing now is just copying Singapore. They sent thousands of officials to see how we do things here. But we're happy.

There are numerous studies by western organizations that shows clear the CCP has much higher approval rate than many western democratic countries. Shouldn't the ones with the higher approval rates be preaching to those that are failing? Would you be happy if my gov or the CCP go ""help"" you guys? 

You guys are all so brainwashed that you think people is China are crying to sleep every night and police are kicking down doors and dragging police to be shot lol. But when I was there everyone was happy.

This is a new video posted yesterday. Please watch it and think how would the police in your country react to the same situation.

It depends for everyone.  I worked from home 100% of the time from 2006-2019.  Then took a new job that is in the office (and I'm back WFH for now).  

The only reason I went into the office is because in early 2019 it seemed like most companies were hating on WFH again and not offering it regularly.  I had to switch jobs when I did because my old company got bought out and all remote workers got the choice of either moving to an office (I didn't wanna move) or being laid off.  So I took the layoff.

That said, when I started in 2006 I was a fresh college grad.  I didn't have any problem working my way up the ladder.  I progressed my career the same as if I was in the office.  I went from Junior developer to developer to senior developer.  I got tired of development and changed jobs and because a data scientist for a bit.  I moved up a few bumps there as well.  At both of those roles I went from being the most junior member to having teams under me.  I got bored of that too and switched to Admin/DevOps work these days.  I've got several direct reports under me and I'm very well liked by the CTO (Chief technical officer) and I'm likely to first in line to replace him when he retires in a few years.  

I really don't think my career would have progressed any differently if I worked in the office for those 13 years.

Sweden has essentially shut itself off to most non-EU residents. It also wouldn't be difficult to enforce a mandatory isolation period for returning travelers. More to the point, Sweden's neighbors have shown that a lockdown can be enforced effectively to minimize the cases/deaths during the initial surge without harming their economies. NZ has done exceptionally well in achieving elimination, but that really was never the central goal of a lockdown.

Also, you still haven't answered the question - what's excessive about the measures taken by countries like NZ, Finland or Norway? What about South Korea, Hong Kong, Vietnam or Singapore?

&gt;NZ is in a unique spot together with a few other countries, such as Iceland. Hopefully they will be able to refuse the virus until a vaccine is available, but there are many months before that will happen and Iceland do see a resurgence in infections already.

Countries like Singapore are already starting to open up via a travel bubble to others with similar rates of community transmission. Many countries with low community spread are likely to do the same soon. At its core, every country has more or less restricted inbound travel to non-residents and NZ isn't an outlier here.

Yes, the ones being run by a president who lies about covid and are being muzzled have different guidelines than the other western democracies.

Masks were known to be effective, the CDC even knew, the white house shut down the plan for masks to be sent to every american and got rid of the requirement for using them during travel.  Why?  Worries about scaring people and the economy is my best guess.

**The spread of infection is gaining new momentum in Sweden, and in healthcare there is an increase in the number of patients being treated for covid-19.        
*""The situation is very, very serious""*, says Karin Tegmark Wisell at the Swedish Public Health Agency.**
  
&amp;nbsp;
    
&amp;nbsp;
  
During Thursday's press conference, the Swedish Public Health Agency reported no further deaths among people with confirmed covid-19 in Sweden. But the spread of infection is gaining momentum. At present, the proportion of positive tests among those tested is 2.9 per cent - a proportion that has increased steadily in recent weeks. 
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
  &gt;""Last week we were at 2.4 percent and the week before that at 1.6 percent"", says Karin Tegmark Wisell.  
  
In Uppsala , for example, there are signs of an extra sharp increase.  
  &gt;""We also do not see signs of the possible slowdown you can see in Skåne and Stockholm"", says Karin Tegmark Wisell.
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
When it comes to the number of people receiving hospital care for covid-19, it is so far a matter of comparatively low numbers, according to the National Board of Health and Welfare's compilation. At present, 25 people are cared for with covid-19 in intensive care, and 152 infected people are cared for in other wards. But the trend is increasing there as well.
  
&amp;nbsp;
    
  &gt;""We see a slight increase in people being cared for for covid-19 in healthcare"", says Mattias Fredricson, unit manager at the National Board of Health and Welfare.
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
On Thursday , the message came that the restrictions on the number of people who may gather at public gatherings are not eased, something Karin Tegmark Wisell justifies with the increased spread of infection.               
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
&gt;""Now we see that the situation is very, very serious with regions that have an increasing spread of infection and we also hear from the National Board of Health and Welfare that there has been a slight increase in the burden in healthcare"", she says.     
        
  &gt;""Then it is not time to lighten up in any way.""
  
&amp;nbsp;
      
  
**Does this mean that we will instead see stricter measures throughout the country?**  
  
&amp;nbsp;
      
  &gt;""It is important that we really think the whole thing before we go out with new recommendations, so that it becomes appropriate. Our mission is to look at public health as a whole, and there we see that there are consequences that are extremely negative. The coin always has two sides"", says Karin Tegmark Wisell.  
  
&amp;nbsp;
      
She mentions the restraining order on nursing homes as an example of how restrictions can have negative consequences in other ways.                      
  
&amp;nbsp;
               
**It is soon autumn break and people are planning trips. Can it be relevant to reintroduce travel restrictions in the country?**  
  
&amp;nbsp;
      
  &gt;&gt;""We may be forced to go back to situations we had before. We try not to have to back down too much, but it is possible to reconsider decisions on reliefs that have been made"", says Tegmark Wisell.             
  
&amp;nbsp;
                           
Earlier in the day, the Swedish Public Health Agency presented the possibility of introducing different types of local measures in different parts of the country.         
  
&amp;nbsp;
                              
  &gt;""The legislation can not be different, it is national. However, in these general guidelines that we have sent out for consultation, the purpose is to clarify what we see as the tools that are most suitable to use in this situation"", says Tegmark Wisell.                       
  
&amp;nbsp;
        
**Can a region then introduce binding rules locally, or are these recommendations?**
  
&amp;nbsp;
       
  &gt;""A general advice is linked to legislation, in this case the Infection Control Act. If compliance is poor, you can move higher up the scale in terms of introducing clearer restrictions"", says Tegmark Wisell.                            
  
&amp;nbsp;
         
She emphasizes that the Swedish strategy is based on an understanding of the situation and that the individual is seen as a responsible person, she continues.  
  
&amp;nbsp;
                  
  
  &gt;""The first step in a staircase is to go that way"", says Karin Tegmark Wisell.
  
&amp;nbsp;
                  
  
&amp;nbsp;
                  
**Facts: Number of dead and infected**              
A total of 97,532 people have been confirmed infected with covid-19 in Sweden.                       
To date, 5,892 of those infected have died.                         
25 people receive intensive care for covid-19 and another 152 people are cared for in other hospital wards.                     

-------------------                    
Note, I'll add two other informations.             

- The numbers on [platz.se](https://platz.se/coronavirus/?lang=en) for October 8 is slightly different: 5912 deceased (+1 in 1 day), 23 ICU and 168 hospitalizations.

- Despite a higher positive rate (4x in 30 days), the numbers of new tests have decreased in the last 3 weeks.

The numbers say absolutely nothing about mentality of a majority of Dutch people. You don't know Dutch, you don't know Dutch culture, you know essentially absolutely nothing about the Netherlands other than the spare tidbits thrown at you from across the ocean. You have absolutely no idea what you are on about and the notion that you can epistemologically 'prove' your anecdotal claims to be general 'fact' merely by citing coronavirus statistics is not only frightfully simple-minded, it's actively, maliciously dishonest.

Want to cite numbers? Cite credible polling and surveys regarding the Netherlands. Remember, you are implicitly asserting that the mentality you *claim* you witnessed is a majority mentality. I'm sitting in front of a poll from a week ago which directly contradicts this. I want you to prove you know your way around Dutch culture, news, healthcare, politics and polling agencies: show me. I'm going to sit back and watch you struggle to come up with data before I post mine, alright?

I'm pretty sure Ticketmaster held on to my money for a good 6 months before it returned. No big deal for me, but I could picture the amount of people who lost their jobs and incomes and had to make ends meet somehow and could've used that money back sooner.

I'm not hating on them for this, I know there is a lot more involved than me as a fan could know but it does raise the question, if he was plenty aware of the situation, living with it, having aftereffects etc. Then why all that delay and uncertainty when it was pretty clear the tour and shows weren't going to happen, and then also why wait until October to speak out about it?

Based on the few cases of reinfection we ahve in healthy people and the fact that coronaviruses are notorious for short term immunity?  Most studies show that people who have been exposed to SARs or MERs do not have enough immunity to protect them years later from a full exposure. They have enough probably if they had PPE on, but that's still not full immunity.  Level of infection mattered as well, if you were asymptomatic or low level infection your odds of getting it again are higher with other coronaviruses like sars.

&gt;  Do you know of any SARS-like virus where reinfection has occurred?

Given the only two other infections that are similar have only happened in a very small number of people, MERS only a few thousand over 8 years and sars I forget the exact number but it stopped quickly, I don't think reinfection is exactly something we would know about with those viruses. 

&gt;  Just that there is not any evidence of short term immunity

There is absolutely short term immunity, we know that for a fact.  How could there not be evidence of this?  It's been around less than a year. I know it feel like forever but march was only 7 months ago. I'll be the first person to say that I believe there is a short term immunity like with most coronaviruses, I just see absolutely no reason why this would be any different from something like sars where at the 1 year point most people did not have appreciable immunity according to one study I saw.  Just because you have *some* immunity doesn't mean it's adequate to protect you from reinfection unless you use PPE or something else that reduces the exposure.  I bet those nurses have that longer than normal immunity because I assume they still use PPE. 

&gt;  there is quite a bit of precedent for longer term immunity with SARS and MERS having long term cellular immunity, and a very low amount of reinfection cases.

There is no evidence I'm aware of showing longer than 1 to 2 years of appreciable immunity, presence of T or B cell immunity doesn't mean anything.

The mechanism is completely different than the flu, but if they do share that similarity as well as being communicable between humans and animals.

I think a lot of you are taking some of the statements about the flu wrong because that comment was often used as a way to downplay the pandemic.

however at the same time you're not really giving the flu it's fully deserved credit for being up virus that can cause pandemic and has killed huge amounts of people over its seemingly endless lifespan.

To be fair you should compare all the years of influenza to one year of covid 19 if that's the statement being made. 

It's not fair in respect to the flu to ignore the fact that one of the flu superpowers is the fact that it comes back every season. That's part of what makes it so deadly. On top of that you should respect the fact that even with a vaccine the flu reliably kills people and can definitely mutate into something as deadly as the Spanish flu is just one cycle.

those are some pretty seriously impressive attributes and if we look at a span of a hundred years the flu is definitely the winner. It's unlikely for any coronavirus with significantly thalassity has the same kind of lasting power as the flu because the flu's ability to mutate is more impressive than copid 19's strange symptoms for ability to produce only short-lived antibodies.

Be fair, influenza is one of the worst viruses humans have ever run into because of how it keeps coming back and produces reasonably impressive lethality even with a vaccine.

Covid-19 is not a little flu, but it's fair enough to compare it to a one of the worst flu outbreaks OR to compare the cumulative damage from eyes of the past or just from this moment on projected into the future.

There's a reasonable chance that humans would adapt to covid 19 because ss not going to mutate anywhere near as fast as the flu. there's really no chance we're going to adapt to the flu because its ability to mutate through recombination is just way too fast for our immune systems to ever keep up with. It is possible we overtime and adoption and that's of those vulnerable facts over 19 would transition into something that looks more like a bad common cold.

The flu is never going to transition into a common cold or even be predictable in the sense that you can expect the same virus from the flu because it can change so much between strains.

So that mutation versus short-lived antibodies I have to say the recombining mutation ability is significantly worse given neither virus has a massive lethality advantage. 

Keep in mind when you say cove is 19 is better than or worse than the flu You're comparing one strain of Corona virus to all the strains of influenza ever.

You're making the wrong comparison and That's technically should be corrected for the sake of accurate knowledge.

Anybody that doesn't know by now that code is 19 is worse than almost any flu in history or any flu in their lifetime can't be helped. Everybody else could benefit from a lesson in the differences between viruses especially the flu since it's one of the most common reoccurring threats.

You don't want to, after this, have a serious flu outbreak and have a bunch of people saying well it's just a little flu it's not coated 19. Maybe it's just a little flu, or maybe you'll bleed out your mouth nose ears and eyes because the flu can do that too. Cove in 19 on the other hand is fairly stable genetically and you're probably not going to get a big swing in the types of symptoms or how it infects people like you can get with the flu in just a few months of mutation or even less.

That stability of xovid 19 is ultimately a pretty big advantage for humans vs I'm trying to combat something as difficult to pin down as the clue because it changes the genetic makeup so all and so reliably.",,,1602358850,{},g8cxp8f,False,t3_j8j0ur,False,True,t3_j8j0ur,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8j0ur/global_study_of_hospitalized_patients_confirms/g8cxp8f/,1602361214,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

[],,D0MD0M,,,[],,,,text,t2_iw2ev,False,False,[],"I'm not for or against HCQ, but there are questions to be asked, when it comes to the dosage.

The study shows:

&gt; In the hydroxychloroquine group, patients received hydroxychloroquine sulfate (in the form of a 200-mg tablet containing a 155-mg base equivalent) in a loading dose of four tablets (total dose, 800 mg) at baseline and at 6 hours, which was followed by two tablets (total dose, 400 mg) starting at 12 hours after the initial dose and then every 12 hours for the next 9 days or until discharge, whichever occurred earlier (see the [**Supplementary Appendix**](https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2022926/suppl_file/nejmoa2022926_appendix.pdf)).[**15**](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022926#) The assigned treatment was prescribed by the attending clinician. The patients and local trial staff members were aware of the assigned trial groups. 

Multiple doctors have pointed out, that this dose of HCQ is not only toxic, but also lethal, especially for older patients.

[https://www.aliem.com/hydroxychloroquine-toxicity/](https://www.aliem.com/hydroxychloroquine-toxicity/)

&gt;Lethal doses are not well established. In children, the reported therapeutic dose is 10 mg/kg. However, the toxic dose is reported as 20 mg/kg with lethal doses suggested to be as low as 30 mg/kg \[4\]. Of note, chloroquine is more potent and toxic than HCQ and as such, ingestions should be treated with extra caution. 

 

&gt;Life-threatening toxicity:  
&gt;  
&gt;Respiratory depression  
&gt;  
&gt;Several electrolyte abnormalities including hypoglycemia and hypokalemia (which can be profound)  
&gt;  
&gt;Cardiac dysrhythmias

These trials for HCQ started in March in several countries including the U.S., Spain, Italy, U.K. and other countries, with a high Covid 19 mortaility.

If you go to [https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps/](https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps/) (This website tracks deaths in european countries), you can see, that excess mortality (from Covid) started in Week 11 of 2020 (at the beginning of March). In addition, some people have a genetic defect (where Malaria used to be present in that past, i.e. Africa), who do not tolerate HCQ.

&gt;This hereditary trait is particularly common among ethnic groups living in areas with malaria. The modified G6PD gene offers advantages in the tropics. It makes its carriers resistant to malaria pathogens. However, G6PD deficiency is also dangerous if those affected come into contact with certain substances found in, for example, field beans, currants, peas and a number of medicines.  
&gt;  
&gt;These include acetylsalicylic acid, metamizole, sulfonamides, vitamin K, naphthalene, aniline, malaria drugs and nitrofurans. The G6PD deficiency then leads to a disruption of the biochemical processes in the red blood cells and – depending on the dose – to mild to life-threatening haemolysis. The debris of the burst erythrocytes subsequently leads to microemboli, which block small vessels throughout the organs. What had caused the illness and death of the young man from Nigeria remained unclear at the time.

This would also explain, why there is such a disproportionate number of deaths amongst black people.

Excerpt from the JAMA source:

&gt;Patients were assessed a mean of 60.3 (SD, 13.6) days after onset of the first COVID-19 symptom; at the time of the evaluation, only 18 (12.6%) were completely free of any COVID-19–related symptom, while 32% had 1 or 2 symptoms and 55% had 3 or more. None of the patients had fever or any signs or symptoms of acute illness. Worsened quality of life was observed among 44.1% of patients. The Figure shows that a high proportion of individuals still reported fatigue (53.1%), dyspnea (43.4%), joint pain, (27.3%) and chest pain (21.7%).

Evidence points to yes.

&gt;It only takes one person to start the wave all over again.

This is only part of the truth. It also requires doing absolutely nothing in response and allowing it to get out of control.

With fewer new cases things like pooled testing become possible which would allow for daily mass testinof all essential workers, health care workers, and schools.

If the infection rates are too high, pooled testing actually required more tests than just actually testing everyone.

That would mean catching these individual cases as they come in form outside immediately and addressing them appropriately.

&gt;The Florida Department of Health has sent near-daily novel coronavirus reports since March on test results, hospitalizations, deaths and more. But a private lab resending 400,000 test results has clogged the system.  
&gt;  
&gt;On Saturday, health officials said that Helix Laboratory, a private lab, sent the DOH about 400,000 previously reported COVID-19 test results on Friday night. This has caused the state to put a hold on releasing Saturday’s state coronavirus updates.  
&gt;  
&gt;This means reporting of the total number of new cases, deaths and hospitalizations in the state will be put on hold until Sunday.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The massive size of the data file and the need to de-duplicate hundreds of thousands of results prevented the Department of Health’s automatic reporting system from processing yesterday’s results as it normally does,” health officials said in a statement.  
&gt;  
&gt;State epidemiologists are working to sort through the data, which will take a day to finish.  
&gt;  
&gt;While this affects the state’s ability to release virus reports, this does not mean residents won’t get their test results. Notification of positive or negative results is done by the lab or entity that performs the test.  
&gt;  
&gt;The state health department may not be able to release information, but the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration dashboard is showing new hospitalization figures for Saturday.  
&gt;  
&gt;As of 4:45 p.m., there were 2,077 COVID-19 patients admitted into hospitals throughout the state, a drop of 66 compared to Friday morning, according to the dashboard.  
&gt;  
&gt;That is a significant decrease from early August, when more than 5,000 COVID-19 patients were admitted into hospitals throughout the state  
&gt;  
&gt;Of Saturday’s hospitalizations, 242 were in Miami-Dade (a drop of 15), 203 in Broward (down by eight), 113 in Palm Beach (up by five) and two in Monroe (a drop by one), according to the agency.",,,1602367314,{},g8do33o,True,t3_j8t78v,False,True,t3_j8t78v,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8t78v/florida_wont_be_releasing_new_coronavirus_cases/g8do33o/,1602372096,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

It seems fairly stable within range 1% in hard hit western countries (Italy is an outlier here) like Spain, UK, US Northeast. Of course the majority of these people will be older and age demographics are import, but when there is a high diffuse spread throughout demographics then the infection rate of young people will have a big effect on fatalities as they will be interacting with older people.

In cases where a country like Singapore pirmarily has a big outbreak among young isolated migrant workers or some micro state has several nursing home outbreaks the IFR doesn't tell you much about the potential epidemiology of the virus in the country, except how it effects a very specific demographic.

And then a country where the median age is 19 will be affected very differently. There are African countries that have done very well in curbing the spread, then there are others where we simply don't know but they have a very young population and the impact may be (relatively) very low even if it spreads like the flu.

If you're trying to say the CDC is filled with good people being led by bad actors, then I'd say sure.  But that doesn't change the fact about anything I just said.  

&gt;  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield says the controversial new process, which calls on hospitals to send capacity and utilization data to HHS, was made with CDC support.

https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/white-house-hospitals-bypass-cdc-report-covid-19-data-directly-hhs

&gt;  On Friday, the CDC's website was apparently updated to suggest that the novel coronavirus may spread through respiratory droplets, or ""small particles,"" including aerosols. The guidance pointed to growing evidence that these small droplets could ""remain suspended in the air and be breathed in by others, and travel distances beyond 6 feet.""

&gt;  It was a radical change from the site's previous iteration, which suggested the biggest risks for coronavirus transmission came from respiratory droplets spread through close contact (within six feet). Instead, it reflected the latest science suggesting that the coronavirus can spread via smaller, aerosolized particles not encountered through direct contact with an infected person.

&gt;  But by Monday, the change was gone. As a federal official familiar with the matter told CNN, the initial publication of the updated guidance 

&gt;  The CDC's website also says that the update was an error.

&gt;  ""Somebody hit the button and shouldn't have,"" the official said. 

https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/cdc-coronavirus-guidelines-changed

The new guidelines that they posted are consistent with every other western democracy's standards and things we've known from the start, but of course the CDC posted the truth and then had to go back and change it.  Why would they do that if not politicized? 

&gt;  Experts were thrilled to see the original update. Many have stressed for months that the virus can travel through tiny particles that float more slowly through the air, not just through the larger droplets that fall to the ground. That’s why both ventilating indoor spaces (to clear out residual virus) and wearing masks (to help block any exhaled particles) are just as, if not more, important than keeping six feet of distance. 

A tweet from a physician before the CDC deleted the page:

&gt;  Extraordinary to see @CDCgov finally acknowledge what scientists like @linseymarr @j_g_allen been saying for months

&gt;  SARS-CoV2 mainly spreads via inhalation of droplets &amp; aerosols

&gt;  Maybe the superb CDC scientists are finally being un-muzzled? We can hope

Secondly, I've decided to come back and take your initial comment in the most charitable manner possible, and to say that perhaps you just completely misread me.  What I said was that we were at under 100 a day, we're now close to 1000, and that most of these cases are happening in those three places: Toronto, Peel, and Ottawa. That's true, and it takes about two minutes to verify.

If you interpreted my words as meaning that I claimed most of our cases are happening in ""restaurants, gyms, cinemas, and other venues"" (which is four places, incidentally, not three) then you have a point.  That's not the case, but it's also not what I claimed.

If however you really were arguing that we weren't under 100 cases a day at one point, or that we aren't close to 1000 a day now, or that they aren't mostly happening in those three regions, then I'll definitely go back to blocking you as a troll who unable to figure out the simplest of google searches.

# Long-term health effects of other coronavirus infections

&gt;A study was performed on the long term effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the coronavirus that emerged in 2003  
&gt;  
&gt;• This study showed there was persistent and significant impairment of exercise capacity and health status in survivors of SARS over 24 months. Health workers who had SARS experienced even more marked adverse impact (1)  
&gt;

It's not anecdotal when they do genome sequencing and see it's a reinfection and it has happened to 22 front line workers.

White House Blocked C.D.C. From Requiring Masks on Public Transportation

The order would have mandated that both passengers and employees wear face coverings on planes, trains, buses and subways and in airports, stations and depots.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention drafted a sweeping order last month requiring all passengers and employees to wear masks on all forms of public and commercial transportation in the United States, but it was blocked by the White House, according to two federal health officials.
The order would have been the toughest federal mandate to date aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus, which continues to infect more than 40,000 Americans a day. The officials said that it was drafted under the agency’s “quarantine powers” and that it had the support of the secretary of health and human services, Alex M. Azar II, but the White House Coronavirus Task Force, led by Vice President Mike Pence, declined to even discuss it.
The two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment, said the order would have required face coverings on airplanes, trains, buses and subways, and in transit hubs such as airports, train stations and bus depots.
A task force official said the decision to require masks should be left up to states and localities. The administration requires the task force to sign off on coronavirus-related policies.


“The approach the task force has taken with any mask mandate is, the response in New York City is different than Montana, or Tuscaloosa, Alabama,” said the official who asked not to be identified because he did not have permission to discuss the matter. “Local and state authorities need to determine the best approach for their responsive effort depending on how the coronavirus is impacting their area.”



Most public health officials believe that wearing masks is one of the most effective ways to protect against the spread of the virus, particularly in crowded, poorly ventilated public places that attract people from all over, like transportation venues. Many feel that the Trump administration has turned the wearing — or not wearing — of masks into a political expression, as seen most dramatically on Monday evening when President Trump whipped off his surgical mask at the White House door after returning from the hospital where he was treated for Covid-19.


“I think masks are the most powerful weapon we have to confront Covid and we all need to embrace masks and set the example for each other,” Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the C.D.C. director, who oversaw the drafting of the order, said in a recent interview.
Dr. Redfield has been publicly at odds with President Trump for promoting mask wearing along with social distancing, and for warning that a vaccine for the virus won’t be widely available until next year.
The thwarting of the mask rule is the latest in a number of C.D.C. actions stalled or changed by the White House. Late last month, the coronavirus task force overruled the C.D.C. director’s order to keep cruise ships docked until mid-February. That plan was opposed by the tourism industry in Florida, an important swing state in the presidential election. Political appointees at the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services have also been involved in rewriting the agency’s guidelines on reopening schools and testing for the virus, bypassing the agency’s scientists.

Some other members of the White House Task Force support a mask mandate. But others do not, among them Dr. Scott W. Atlas, a radiologist who has become Mr. Trump’s closest adviser on the coronavirus, and Mr. Pence, who runs the panel and sets the agenda 



Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon and chairman of the House committee on transportation and infrastructure, criticized Mr. Trump for ignoring public health experts from his own administration on the mask issue.
“It’s especially outrageous because the science is so clear: masks save lives,” Mr. DeFazio said. “The millions of Americans who work in and use our transportation systems every day — from bus drivers, train conductors and flight attendants, to the frontline workers who rely on public transit — deserve to know their president is relying on experts’ best advice and doing everything possible to keep them safe.”
The transportation trades department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which represents 33 unions with what it describes as “millions” of transportation workers, said that the administration last week rejected its July petition to require passengers to wear masks on public transportation.
Larry Willis, president of the department, said his members were being endangered by a patchwork of rules regarding face coverings on airplanes, trains and buses around the country, as well as in airports, train stations and bus depots.
“Some airports are all in and they require masks when you walk in the door,” Mr. Willis said. “Some places where masks have become too politicized, the right mandates are not in place.”
“I think it creates an uncertain level of health and safety for workers and passengers,” he said. “This is a global pandemic, this is a national emergency. We should have a national standard.”

Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants, said that while airlines do technically require passengers to wear face coverings, enforcement can be difficult.
“If there is a requirement by regulation or law, then there’s typically a consequence for not following that regulation or law,” Ms. Nelson said. “So that gives us backing and it often serves as a deterrent from bad behavior.”

They weren't on lockdown. They were on level 3 for part of the country, level 2 for the rest. And that was not the whole country, just parts. And NZ is a special case anyway.

&gt;Victoria is currently locked down to attempt to defeat in infection also born of international arrivals

Is Victoria a country?

&gt;In the north of the UK

Not a country.

&gt;trying to open up without first eradicating the disease

Not realistic and not what authorities in any country are trying to do. Everyone is just attempting to keep it under control until the vaccine arrives. That means local measures in waves, not countrywide lockdowns like in March/April.

&gt;They are locked down because it's the only thing that actually works

That said, while antibodies aren't the whole story of immunity, no it's not just some small percentage of people.  Fauci said that even the vaccines are likely to be limited to a year of effectiveness and will need a booster, and those are designed to illicit an immune response.  There is also the evidence that covid19 tricks your immune system in some people long term, where their immune system is actually tricked into helping the virus instead of fighting it, making reinfection more dangerous than your first infection.  Coronavirus immunity lasting very long is unusual with the original sars being one of the longer lasting immunities but still many studies showed about half of people didn't have any appreciable immunity by the 1 year point. 

https://www.sciencealert.com/35-year-study-of-coronavirus-reinfections-suggests-human-immunity-is-short-lived

There is nothing to suggest that covid immunity will be long term, there are already cases of reinfections despite having been less than a year into the pandemic, and basically all coronaviruses have immunity lasting less than a year.  For covid19 to have a longer immunity would actually make it even more unusual of a virus.  

Can we 100% say that covid19 will have a short lived immunity for everyone?  No, but there are enough cases of reinfection and short lived immunity in otherwise healthy individuals (look at indian front line workers) along with all of the other coronavirus information that makes it extraordinarily unlikely.  Give the virus a few more months and we should have more data on long term immunity.",,,1602351984,{},g8cdgo7,False,t3_j8j0ur,False,True,t1_g8cbz3g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8j0ur/global_study_of_hospitalized_patients_confirms/g8cdgo7/,1602352409,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

No they do not, they use masks like you say. If you go to Tokyo right now you can even enter bars in the tiniest buildings where social distancing is impossible. Most people still have to go to the office, most people still go out after work, most people still meet up with others. My family is from Japan by the way, I am in close contact with them as well as my wife whom is Japanese and I'm currently stuck in NL.

&gt;No they did not deny masks work in the Dutch NL. They've made stances that certain types of face coverings don't work but not that actual masks don't work.

This is what the ""Dutch Fauci"" Van Dissel states ""gewone mondkapjes hebben weinig effect"" which translated to English says ""normal facemasks have a limited effect/not much effect"". Something that has been disproven in Asia many times, simple 3 layer facemasks that you can buy pretty much everywhere limit infections by up to 80% when both parties wear a mask. Something that for example the Japanese do. When you walk the streets over there, facemasks are worn by pretty much everyone. In the Tokyo area with 30 million people the amount of infected people are around a hundred a day and the mortality has not shown a steep rise.

[],,Vindve,,,[],,,,text,t2_owrq8,False,False,[],"Hey all! Just a message from France, as I see there is a lot of comments about our very high number of new cases.

Government dashboard to understand what is going on: [https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/carte-et-donnees](https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/carte-et-donnees) See the very helpful graphs on the «vue d'ensemble» vue, as well as the «suivi des tests» view.

Ok, so numbers tell a few things.

We've got a lot of cases right now, yes. But also we're testing way, way more. We're currently doing around 160k tests/day on weekdays, for a 65M people country. Back in April we were doing around 10k tests daily only. So what this means is probably we missed most of the cases during the first wave, that weren't reported, and that other countries may be under-reporting cases too.

The important shit is what happens at the hospital. See the «vue d'ensemble» view, you have a «nouveaux patients hospitalisés» graph = new arrivals for COVID at the hospital. And a «nouveaux patients en réanimation» graph, which is new COVID patients admitted in ICU. Basically, we have a moderate second wave, that is flattening, with around 700 countrywide hospital admissions per day due to COVID, and 140 people admitted per day in intensive care (induced coma, artificial ventilation and all).

That's still too much, because the «stock» of people in the hospital is increasing: see for example the «en réanimation» (in ICU) graph. We were at a low 400 beds in august, now at 1400 beds countrywide. Peak 1st wave, there were 7000 ICU beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, and 30,000 overall beds.

Problem: winter is coming, that already represents 30% of ICU beds of the country, and more than 40% in some regions (see «carte des indicateurs»).  So that means they're starting to delay some chirurgical operations. And that they don't know how they're gonna treat the flu season. Plus, there is a HUGE medical workforce fatigue. They handled the first wave with pure courage and bravery. They can't handle a second one.

Good news is: the curves aren't too hard, nothing to see with the first wave, when COVID hit a country totally unprepared. Seems that masks and social distancing are helpful after all. Deaths are still controlled («only» 70 COVID deaths at hospital per day, against up to 700 during first wave), but that's gonna change for sure.

So as you see, the situation is shit, we're having a mild second wave, with COVID fatigue and all, but not as shit as number of cases would tell.

How did we get there, what is done currently, what is expected to happen?

Well as you know, we had a bad first COVID wave, a little bit less than Spain and Italy, but yet. No other choice than a strict lockdown of the country for nearly two months. We didn't had tests, mask, anything back then. So many deaths and fear.

Then the country lift progressively the lockdown, and summer arrived. The idea was to rely on tests to identify and track agressively any new cluster, and put in quarantine cases, and «contact cases». Also: masks, mandatory in any public closed space, public transportation, etc, and huge events cancelled. Well, to be honest, everybody relaxed. A little bit too much. We were taking the mask thing as an annoyance, you could easily lift by just taking drinks with friends at the bar. Youngsters did what young people do: go to the beach, party with friends. Well, the virus spread everywhere, and went undetected – a lot of youngsters are asymptomatic. And when we realized it, it was a little bit too late.

Since September, government is struggling to try to fight this mild second wave, that is coming through youngsters, and crawling up ages. First they tightened the mask obligation. In the Paris region, it's mandatory pretty much everywhere except at home. Even in the street, or in the parks. It wasn't enough, they lowered the bar for meetings. They're now closing bars (again) in big cities, but keeping restaurants open. Saying all companies should rely as much as possible on telework. But we can't afford a second real lockdown, so companies, factories, transportation, restaurants, shops, everything stay open. Of course the country is in economic depression, companies are closing, people are fired and all.

It's not a happy period, and we're surrounded by cases.

I think winter is gonna be tough, but somehow, I'm optimistic, because the trend is not too bad (not a too steep hospital entrance and death curve, due to a controlled R0 with all the social limitations). So there won't be a second lockdown and as many deaths (I hope, but Madrid makes me fear). Just, I want to be out of it as everybody.

So this was it, reporting from France, I hope this explains a little bit more what's going on here.",,,1602351513,{},g8ccm8b,False,t3_j8kuf4,False,True,t3_j8kuf4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8kuf4/daily_discussion_post_october_10_questions_images/g8ccm8b/,1602351939,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

COVID is overwhelming killing BIPOC. Sure it’s also killing some whites too, but you have to remember that they see sickness as a weakness. They actually believe they are better in every way - that God is on their side and that their genes are better. Even if they do get sick they are completely convinced they have nothing to worry about. It has little to do with believing in science at all and everything to do with culling.

From a business point of view they see this state of unemployment as ripe opportunity. You have millions of people now willing to do anything for any amount of money. This will keep wages down and the people they kept will work 10x a hard because they don’t want to lose their jobs.

It also opens up the housing market where all these wealthy aholes will buy everything up dirt cheap and make even more. The rich benefit off this pandemic in every way. They also already had plenty of money to insulate themselves. They have huge amounts of space, multiple houses, private planes and boats. Their social lifestyle might have changed a little but not much.

Keeping large portions of the population sick means chaos and fatigue. American healthcare is so bad and the hospitals will get so over run they will account for people that could of been saved but won’t be. Citizen will be too tired to fight back so they get away with even more. 

People need to wake up and except that they want as many people to die as possible. I’m honestly surprised that trump isn’t holding meet and greets where you pay to shake hands with him. I for sure think the most insane on his cult would be thrilled to get the blessed COVID the president is carrying, it will make them stronger if they were chosen! 

He wants it to spread through the government because he believes it will only kill those not loyal to him. Like I said people need to start thinking crazier and more evil when it comes to Trump and his enablers.

Which papers exactly would that be?

&gt;The infection does elict a robust systemic immune memory accross all disease severities

And yet most of the papers looking into this report lower antibodies and fading faster in mild and asymptomatic cases. 

The reported properly documented reinfection cases, small of a sample size as they are, are basically 33%/33%/33% milder/same/more serious. 

For the CCCs, there have actually not been as extensive studies of the severity of reinfection as one would like to see -- when this has been looked at, the sample sizes were always small. And given that most CCC infections are mild to begin with, assessing severity is not easy. 

In any case, we will know empirically what the truth is over the next 18 months, perhaps the next 6. 

I take the Iranian officials saying that 20-30% of the hospitalized patients during their current wave are reinfection cases very seriously -- they have been downplaying COVID throughout the whole pandemic, so they have absolutely no reason to be saying this repeatedly, yet they are. So this can well go down as yet another example of uppity academic experts in the West disregarding empirical evidence in a rapidly developing real-world situation because they don't like the source, then getting caught with their pants down.

Nothing in it suggests it was substantially here before Jan 1.

Now there actually is a point to be made about this virus that its explosive spread is driven by superspreading events, so that the simple model of ""doubling every 3 days"" does not apply at all to initial cryptic spread of the virus.  In fact it is expected that it takes multiple seed cases to cause pandemic spread.  The majority of seed cases actually only go on to infect a few people and eventually do not ultimately transmit.  This is theorized to have actually happened with the first ""WA1"" case in Washington State where that person simply wasn't responsible for the epidemic spread in Washington.  Genetically that line of virus was completely displaced by some other individual bringing a genetically distinct virus to WA.

So the initial spread is a slow fizzle.  Once you get ignition though and start talking 1,000 cases in a community, then you start getting superspreading events going off continuously and then the exponential math takes over.

So that means that it is plausible that handfuls of people got it in late Dec  / early Jan.  Nobody can really rule that out.  But nobody in this thread caught that.

I find it so odd because beyond their 2 month lockdown, NZ actually has had less restrictive measures than Sweden for the better part of the last 5 months since they reopened in May. Finland and Norway have the same timeline as NZ, albeit their measures are more similar to Sweden's. That being said, the relatively short lockdown meant they were able to flatten their curves sooner and preserve more lives.

Yet, when discussing a country like NZ, it's not uncommon to hear people describe their measures as draconian.

Prior to the pandemic, my company right up through the CEO had an office culture. We have 50,000 employees. Only slightly less than 10,000 of those are essential. Our company sent everyone nationwide and overseas to work from home in the very first week of March. in May, because I'm a people manager, I received a survey from senior leadership asking me to assess the productivity of my team for the previous two plus months since we had been working from home. My company is a critical IT infrastructure provider, and so we had been incredibly busy and our team had continued to work as effectively and efficiently as they would if they were in the office and I made sure the survey results reflected that. In June, all employees got an email giving them two weeks to decide if they wanted to work from home permanently, or if they wanted cubicle space in a brick and mortar location. three free guesses to anyone who's read this far what the majority of people chose. :-)

In August and September, the company started announcing its office consolidation plans. We have four brick and mortar offices in the greater DC metropolitan area, and that will be going down to just one. Of the one, where we had three and a half floors of space, we are going to one floor of space in the building. Office space is primarily going to be reserved for senior management who have to have offices that they can lock due to sensitive information. Pretty much everybody else who wants to come into a physical office will be using hotel space.

I am expecting my company to make office supplies and office equipment more available to us in the coming months. They just don't have the intranet set up the way a company that was 100% work from home hasn't set up, with agreements with major office supplies providers, storefronts internally to select a printer and things like that.

I think this is a good thing. My stress level has been lower since we went exclusively to work from home because I'm not fending in traffic, something that always raised my blood pressure. I just want to state for the record, I know that sounds tone deaf. I know that's not the way most people have experienced this pandemic. I know I'm very lucky to have maintained my employment and to be able to work from home. I merely point that out because it is true. I have been less stressed because I've not been commuting. 

A lot has been made by the current administration of the cleaner air figures and readings that are coming back from EPA. The pandemic gets the credit for that as well. The air quality had been steadily worsening throughout the entire administration primarily due to a lot of rolling back of clean air standards and things of that nature, and you saw that turn around in an April May time frame when people stopped commuting.

I really hope I see innovation that embraces the new normal for office workers whose office is now in their home. it can't all be s*** here with this pandemic long-term, you know?

“This provides a case example of how health system analytics combined with EHR data can provide powerful and agile tools for identifying when future trends in patient populations are outside of the expected ranges,” the UCLA team concluded, adding, “Lessons learned from this pandemic will hopefully lead to better preparation and the ability to quickly provide warnings and track the next pandemic.”

I am a very patient person and, when this started, I said ""I'll give it a year"". - so my point here was asking if these matter were being discussed. You hope for the best but plan for the worst!

If I may ask, so - where exactly would your line be if you were in my basic shoes? Healthy, vegetarian, active, never been in the hospital in my life - but 67 years old - current calc that take blood work, etc. into account give me about .6% mortality.

So, if at the one year mark - March, 2020 - all the above together brings my risk to .3%, is that then ""sane"" to stop the lockdown? We know it's not going to go to zero or even close for seniors (it already is close to that for under 50 and healthy).

It's a hard question - let's not pretend it's all rosy.

Keep in mind that the SPA I am thinking of WOULD have most all of the basic stuff proven to work (for a price!) and I could even sign off on experimental treatments and even a vaccine if desired. This is yet another benefit since in the normal scheme of things I may not have such access.

In one scenario here, I'd pay $50K or so for a month...the idea being most of the SPA patients would get better with almost no treatment and the extra profit made from them could help the more costly patients.

I still am amazed it's not being spoken of.

BUT, I agree that we have to add TIME to that - and check again in 3 months and in 3 months again and so on.

But it's not zero basis. 

But, again, we have zero basis to say a vaccine will be effective - or exist at all within a couple years since 4 years is the soonest in past history AND many do not have vaccines. 

One has to add all the odds and scenarios together- and then use fuzzy logic and their own situation to make determinations.

Remember, my discussion does not endanger others. That makes it much different than even those who accidentally get the virus (my way is better - does not put others in danger).

We cannot pretend that everything is the same...in any way. The largest odds going - maybe you will even agree - is that given a vaccine and improved treatments and perhaps a return to a more healthy populace (less obesity, diabetes) that we will cut the IFR for those under 70 to the levels of flu...which we do consider background (.1%). Right now it is .5% among all populations so it's probably already .2% among healthy under a certain age. 

There is hardly any chance of mortality bring brought down much lower than that. If that is the case, where if your ""line""? Even if I self-infected I can still get vaccines in a couple years to keep the immunity up. 

I hope this doesn't sound too complicated? But it might come down, for me, to whether I want to wait 2 years for a .25% mortality (given my age) or take the shot now at a .5% mortality. While there is a difference there it's not as if the Lord, Science or Reason drew a line at .3 and said ""well, under this it's cool"". 

What happened happened due to complete failure of our leadership and citizens. But we should not use those numbers going forward - no one, let alone WHO, CDC or any other body, says the IFR is going to be anywhere near the same going forward - and we see that already.

Off topic,  but this has been a very positive comment chain.  Normally it is impossible to have these discussions without simply resorting to politics.  Everyone on this sub wants to believe all deaths are covid-caused to prove themselves right,  and every Russian account wants to believe they are lockdown-caused so they can show how bad lockdowns are.  In the end there's usually some compromise where the Russian account gets the /r/coronavirus member to agree that certainly some of the excess deaths are caused by lockdowns.  But all the evidence,  frankly,  is that none of them are (lockdowns were short and should prevent a healthcare deficit,  not cause one).

There is ""truth"" here,  but since we aren't even trying to find out what it is we can't ""wait"" for it.  We have to just adjust our beliefs as data comes in.

No, it’s not.  Reread what I wrote.

&gt;Sure, if you assume that literally everyone who dies this year, died from covid, you can get 11.69x the official count. 

That’s exactly what I wrote.  That is what it means to be a “maximum estimate.”  I was calculating the maximum value that the estimate could be.  What I said was there is room for a COVID estimate to account for UP TO 11.69x of its current death toll. You, on the other hand, were saying there wasn’t even enough death to account for an estimate that high, when all I ever really said was 2x or 3x, or maybe higher if latent/long-term symptoms prove to be an issue.   

&gt;That’s a terrible way to figure out what the real error bars could reasonably be. The real upper limit is the number you calculated earlier (390,000) once we reach the end of the year.

It’s rough, but that was not my goal, I was calculating the upper bounds of the estimate, and no that is not a much better calculation.  A better calculation would be to actually do a similar estimate to the flu estimate with similar methodology and similar goals and then compare the two.

&gt;No, this is not happening. See above. There are very likely tens of thousands, but the chances of hundreds of thousands of unaccounted for deaths are vanishingly small. There have not been enough excess deaths this year for that to be true.

It’s happening as we speak every time COVID infects someone and increases their chances of an ultimately shortened lifespan through any number of damaging effects from COVID that we are only just beginning to understand.  The flu estimate should not be compared to raw death counts.

&gt;That’s why I’m not comparing those two numbers. I’m comparing the number of additional deaths that occurred this year because of covid, as estimated by the excess deaths, vs the estimated number of flu related deaths per the CDC.

Excess deaths are a decent measurement to use here, and they may be a better indicator of the actual covid death count, but **it doesn’t make your comparison to the flu estimate any more valid.** It suffers from the same exact problems.  It is still a raw death count that doesn’t capture the true death toll of the virus, the entire burden of the disease like the flu estimate attempts to do.  It does not take long term factors into account like the flu estimate does.  The flu estimate factors in a whole lot more deaths because of this.  That’s a lot of why it’s ~5x the number of actual deaths, because we have evidence it’s probably ultimately contributing to a lot more deaths than our doctors realize based on scientific analysis.  You should still be comparing excess deaths to actual influenza deaths.",,,1602286235,{},g89kjpk,False,t3_j79zty,False,True,t1_g89gl69,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j79zty/coronavirus_killing_three_times_more_people_than/g89kjpk/,1602288077,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,1602287920.0

One of my favourite writers once suggested that words were the boundaries over which rival groups of shamans negotiated peace. I think if we recognised that nutcases like Hannity, Carlson, Maher and other opinion journalists functioned like shamans used to: defining reality, we could more honestly discuss them. They're not experts, they just define which 'experts' are acceptable. Far more powerful and dangerous than just an expert.

On the other hand, many other sources like this one have been saying it's much deadlier than the flu. And all those who have died from covid are very real.

It's not just bots, &amp; it's not just T_D.

This has been something getting its fire stoked outside of Russian interference for a while. It's not just that defunct subreddit either.

With the things going on in the USA *right now*, WE have called it ""civil war"" in other countries.

Further more: when was our last civil war? Late 1800's. It would be *strange* that we didn't have one soon, it's the natural course of *many* nation-states to have a civil war roughly every 100 years.

It's coming. Have a plan.

And finally; reddit, tumblr, &amp; other online communities fail to accept a constant play that occurs with outside agitators to countries.

And that being, they *never* just agitate ONE SIDE. It happens to ""the left"" as well. Go dive into r/politics (a subreddit, along with r/The_Dipshit, I've filtered away). If you think separatist &amp; eliminationist rhetoric isn't happening in the left-friendly subreddits as well, you're not paying attention.

**Source** (since it's a thing here on reddit): I'm ex-Army, I'm a child of immigrants from the Former Federal Republic of Jugoslavia, &amp; have a hankering for Funk music, Math rock, &amp; spy novels.

You need to prepare, you need to make a plan... and you need to keep hoping that you'll never need either. Better to have &amp; not need, than need &amp; not have.

You don't give them to patients who are likely to produce their own antibodies because then you're going to have an immune overreaction which is dangerous itself.

It's not going to prevent the patient from becoming sick totally, that's not their goal. The goal is to allow the immune system to combat the virus, and patients can still get sick while that happens. All things consider Trump had a relatively mild case of Coronavirus, especially given his risk factors. Age, obesity, etc. We have no idea the specifics of his case but we know he never went on a ventilator and is still walking around today.

&gt;
&gt;At home I have a private office.  In my private office I have a window to open to get some fresh air on nice days.  I control the lights and temperature to my own liking.  I've got my own coffee machine with the exact coffee I like.  I've got a mini fridge filled with the soda I like.  I've got a water cooler with spring water (which to  me tastes a thousand times better than filtered water).
&gt;
&gt;I've also got an amazing Lazy-Boy computer chair.  A huge oversized L shaped desk.  I've got my own computer with an i9 processor, 64GB of RAM and super fast NVME hard drives.  I've got 6 32 inch monitors hooked up to my PC.  I've got an amazing mechanical keyboard and a wonderful track ball.  My desk also adjusts between sitting and standing when I want to stretch my legs.
&gt;
&gt;I also control the noise in my home office.  I can play music or not, and nobody is on the phone in the background.
&gt;
&gt;At work, I sit in a cheap office chair in a cramped cubical using 2 20 inch monitors and a cheapo keyboard and mouse.  The office lights are hella bright (I'm not the only one who complains about it) and the building is always either too hot or too cold.  The laptop they give to work off of has a low end core i5 and 8gm of ram with the cheapest slowest ssd on the planet.

This is insanity. 

Who is spreading such misinformation???

How is it that months into this people have gotten exactly the wrong message relative to what the facts are?

People generate an immune response, just as they do to anything foreign that enters their organisms

That is completely irrelevant. The question is how long immunity lasts.

With a couple dozen fully documented reinfection cases already (one has to pass an extremely high bar to prove reinfection so it is not surprising there have not been many), many thousands anecdotal ones, the very well documented disappearance of antibodies after a few months, and reinfection being the norm for the CCCs, we are heading towards a situation in which we will have massive COVID waves every year or couple of years. 

And yet somehow there is no shortage of people who have been tricked into believing that even asymptomatic cases will confer long lasting immunity...

BTW, what you said is not even correct:

[],,Partha4us,,,[],,,,text,t2_4dv3w4se,False,False,[],"If a corona vaccine causes unexpected side effects in the future, the Dutch government will make a financial contribution to any claims for damages. This is apparent from agreements made between member states of the European Union and pharmacists. 


According to Minister Hugo de Jonge (Public Health), 'Member States offer financial compensation in the event of claims relating, for example, to a hidden defect of a vaccine that was not known at the time of admission'. These include side-effects that did not come to light during the testing phase of a vaccine. 


The Netherlands, together with the other member states, has made deals with six different pharmacists about the purchase of millions of corona vaccines. These are now being tested on tens of thousands of test subjects worldwide. If it turns out that the vaccines are effective and do not cause any serious side effects, they will in all likelihood be marketed from the beginning of next year. 


Because the vaccines are being developed at lightning speed and therefore long-term side effects cannot be completely ruled out, this summer the pharmacists advocated cost-sharing in such cases in the event of any claims for damages. After all, a normal vaccine research takes much longer, argued AstraZeneca top executive Ruud Dobber in July of this year: ""This is a unique situation in which we, as a company, cannot take risks if, for example, it turns out that a vaccine will cause side effects in four years' time.   

Those involved in the European Commission hint that the member states are prepared to do this. It remains unclear exactly what this distribution will look like. However, a distinction would be made between the various pharmacists. The Swedish-United Kingdom AstraZeneca, for example, would be better protected than other pharmacists because it wants to offer corona vaccines at cost price for its first orders. AstraZeneca, which is working with researchers at Oxford University on a vaccine, has been offered a so-called safeguard clause, it sounds. This means that up to a certain amount, the pharmacist himself is responsible for the costs of claims for damages in the event of unforeseen side effects. Above that amount, the member states would take over the costs. 


Clarification
The fact that the member states have made agreements behind the scenes shoots the wrong throat in the case of opposition party GroenLinks. GroenLinks MP Corinne Ellemeet demands clarification from De Jonge: ""The pharmacists get away with this too easily. Their business models are fully geared to profit. So why do governments have to contribute to any claims for damages? In addition, something like this can set a precedent for the future: you put the door ajar for pharmacists to get out of damage claims"".

Next week, the Lower House will debate this issue with the Minister of Ark, who is responsible for medicines. Ellemeet: If the uncertainty remains, the pharmacists in question can even be summoned to a hearing in the Lower House. The government is investing millions in the vaccines, then we have a right to openness. At the same time, more transparency also increases public confidence. This secrecy is grist to the mill for vaccine skeptics"". 

Obligation of secrecy
AstraZeneca states that the content of the deals is confidential and therefore does not want to reveal any information. De Jonge also points to the duty of confidentiality imposed by the European Commission: The purpose of this duty of confidentiality is twofold: on the one hand, it serves to avoid influencing negotiations with other producers. On the other hand, company confidential and stock market sensitive information of the producer is exchanged during the negotiations. It cannot become public'. 

Earlier it appeared that such agreements can have considerable consequences. In 2018, State Secretary Blokhuis (Public Health) set aside 5 million euros to compensate people who became seriously ill after receiving a vaccine against swine flu. 

This involved Pandemrix, a vaccine that was distributed on a much smaller scale than is now intended with a corona vaccine. In 2009, about half a million children in the Netherlands received an injection with this vaccine. Later research showed that the drug may cause narcolepsy, a rare sleep disorder, as a side effect.

To preface, nursing was a second degree for me too. Since then I’ve done ICU, Cardiac Cath, and IR/stroke, then traveled all over the US taking contracts in all three, close to 15 years total now. I happened to be on contract in NYC when COVID hit, then moved on to Boston while they were just past their peak. Been hanging here since then, not sure where I’ll go next yet.

My honest, overall opinion? There’s good places and bad, good days and bad, but nothing can replace the feeling of changing someone’s life the way we do. We get to change lives every. single. day. in ways most folks might get to do once or twice in their entire lifetime. You don’t do it for thanks or praise, you’ll almost never hear it. You do it because it satisfies some weird, fucked up need deep inside you to help people in this particular way. And those few times when you do hear thank you? A sincere, genuine, honest-to-goodness, eye-contact thank you? Fucking gold, my dude. 

And btw, I think this applies to all types of healthcare, not just nursing. If healthcare is right for you, there’s plenty of options and all of them are necessary parts of a larger whole that contributes to a greater good. Finding a team that values you (and that you value in return) can be a huge part of both your day-to-day stress and overall job satisfaction, especially during times like these. Burnout **does** happen, and it happens much faster in the wrong role or a bad environment. We’re not heroes, we’re people doing a job. Hopefully, it’ll be the right job for you, too.

See? This is why you're supposed to listen to the *scientists*, not the *politicians*! Because politicians *never* know as much about the pandemic and the virus as scientists do. 

And so they make *really* unrealistic and chimerical promises to keep the morale and compliance of the public high, such as ""15 days to stop the spread"", ""next year will be better"", or ""we will return to normal at (whatever date)"" (in this case, Christmas). But all the scientists have long agreed upon and accepted as *fact* that no, this *will* take much longer than two weeks; yes, things *will* still end up getting cancelled in 2021 as well (Coachella, BlizzCon, Broadway, you name it); and *no*, we are *not* returning to ""old normal"".

OCS put it best, emphasizing that even when the vaccine is out and it all *seems* to be over, we are *not* ""going back to brunch"" and pretending that COVID-19 is eradicated. Because it won't be. Russia saw their highest single-day spike yesterday, even *with* a vaccine in EUA.

If politicians are your primary source of COVID-19 information, then I *seriously* recommend that you find some *more qualified* experts to listen to. They are *almost definitely* going to shift the goalposts. Of course they will; they're *politicians*! Yes, it might seem like scientists also do that, but at least *they* are forgiven, because they're dealing with a constantly evolving novel disease pandemic situation. Their message might not always be pleasant (which is partly responsible for too many common folk ignoring them), but what they say tends to be more objective, consistent, and reliable, and less partisan and biased, than what politicians say.

Gyms should not be open right now at all. Using the two wrongs make a right defense is incredibly immature.

&gt;On top of that, in my state, you don’t even need to wear a mask when exerting yourself at the gym! 

The ignorance is astounding.

&gt;From a purely harm reduction point of view, you should be encouraging gym goers to exercise outside, mask on or off.

Put the straw man away and have an honest conversation.

All gyms should be closed and everyone should be marked up in public. Plain and simple.

&gt;Next, you state that exertion is “one of the worst things” but you do not provide a source indicating that this has actually been a problem.

You have not been paying attention to anything the last 10 months, have you?

You really cannot fathom how breathing more and more heavily could possibly put more virus particles into the air than  breathing less and more softly?

Basically that it doesn't matter if you're wearing a mask you can still get sick but it greatly reduces the severity, that it can linger in the air for hours in one spot so it doesn't matter if the person coughing was there 5 or maybe even 30 minutes earlier it's likely still in the air and contagious,  and that the 6 foot rule is absolute horseshit indoors.  It's why outdoors is so low risk when masks are worn even in relatively close quarters, because it dissipates really quickly. 

It also means that getting sick by eye infection is more likely than we had thought, and explains that one study from china where 5% of those wearing glasses caught covid but 30% without glasses caught covid.  

Don't ya wish you knew these things sooner?  The rest of the world knew.  My doctor knew.  She sent a letter to my pain clinic doctor explaining why i needed to be drug tested outdoors due to covid and cited studies with those findings.  The public was not made aware because it would greatly impact businesses and the way they function, instead of letting the people know and give money to businesses to reformat their designs to be safe.  That's my honest thought at least. 

If you have to go indoors though wearing a shield plus a mask massively reduces the risk.  The theory is the front of the shield hits the airborne particles and protects your eyes as well, then the mask protects what you breathe from around the mask.  N95 plus shields had no infections in some hospitals, n95s alone for nurses had something like a 25% infection rate.",,,1602355281,{},g8cmktz,False,t3_j8j0ur,False,True,t1_g8cjdfd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8j0ur/global_study_of_hospitalized_patients_confirms/g8cmktz/,1602356535,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Once again: They're keyframes. They're encoded to occur periodically. The more frequently they occur, the higher quality the encoding (that's an over simplification, but it'll do). Movement is encoded separately, which is why you see that weird distortion on online videos sometimes where the colours get really messed up, but you can still see a characters face in the mess. Then POP! It'll correct itself. That POP is a keyframe.

The interval is a few seconds, which is why it's consistently popping, even though the background isn't actually repeating.

1. If you are a task driven individual, who enjoys working with colleagues but who doesn't go to work to find friends and finds company social initiatives somewhat forced, you'll enjoy home work better.


2. Commuting even 30mins a day, still means you get 5 extra hours a week of your time back. 


3.  If you can cook or put together your own food, you save a lot of money from not buying lunch and it's probably healthier, meaning you feel better over time.


4. In an office, other people are more inclined to stop by your desk for a chat. Even if it's business related, it's not focused conversation and takes longer. That can add up to a lot less actual work production.


5. If a person is able to use technology, there is a bunch of automations that can speed up your work processes, these processes work very well with a task driven person who has no other distractions.


6. Many people are affected by office / department politics, perhaps bullying, unsoliticed advances or general 'eugh'....this is severely reduced when at home.

Our identification approach exploits the previously mentioned regional variation in the point in time when face masks became compulsory in public transport and sales shops. We use data for 401 German regions to estimate the effect of this public health measure on the development of registered infections with Covid-19. We consider the timing of mandatory face masks as an exogenous event to the local population. Masks were imposed by local authorities and were not the outcome of some process in which the population was involved.2 We compare the Covid-19 development in various regions to their synthetic counterparts. The latter are constructed as a weighted average of control regions that are similar to the regions of interest. Structural dimensions taken into account include prior Covid-19 cases, their demographic structure and the local health care system.
We indeed find strong and convincing statistical support for the general perception that public wearing of face masks in Jena strongly reduced the number of incidences. We obtain a synthetic control group that closely follows the Covid-19 trend before introduction of mandatory masks in Jena and the difference between Jena and this group is very large after 6 April. Our findings indicate that the early introduction of face masks in Jena has resulted in a reduction of almost 25% in the cumulative number of reported Covid-19 cases after 20 days. The drop is greatest, larger than 50%, for the age group 60 years and above. Our results are robust when we conduct sensitivity checks and apply several placebo tests, e.g. tests for pseudo-treatment effects in similarly sized cities in the federal state of Thuringia and for pseudo-treatment effects in Jena before the treatment actually started.

I'm still stunned at the number of armchair experts and even legit scientists and doctors who think surfaces and even airborne droplets are the primary routes. I've been reading Linsey Marr and other aerosol scientists twitter feeds since a few of these scientists were featured in the NY Times back in JUNE. Throughout the summer, even OTHER SCIENTISTS fought the aerosol tide like hell as it rose ever higher until it became a tsunami of evidence... and STILL the same scientists are in denial.

What chance does the public have when even science has been infected with ego, Iong held but unfounded beliefs, and suppression of evidence to the contrary of their narrative?

So far it's happened with masks, asymptomatic transmission, and aerosols.

This article is from APRIL.

https://www.businessinsider.com/south-korean-call-center-covid-19-outbreak-seating-chart-2020-4

 At the time, doctors and scientists like Osterholm were all over CNN and MSNBC saying that these contact traced outbreak studies were ""inconclusive"", ""circumstantial"", ""based on massive assumptions"", and ""imperfect"". Six months later they're the gold standard that's used as a basis for how the virus is transmitted/referenced constantly. Why? 

Because these same people learned how difficult it is to do proper contact tracing in the U.S. and the circumstances one can ""assume"" from that study prove to work when describing how the virus will spread in virtually every situation.

Contact tracing in the U.S. is a frigging mess and largely a blame game of wishful/magical thinking and ACTUAL assumptions with no basis in reality. For instance, they stay ""objective"" by not skewing for the fact that a person who wants their kids in sports programs and rants and raves about it if the school is closed cause of an outbreak is also more likely than anyone else within a cluster to engage in other risky activities. Things like dining indoors, going to a poorly ventilated office and not wearing a mask, and being in close contact with other people who would do the same. In South Korea, they CAN reasonably assume most people are following the same protocols.

This following article expresses the dismay of doctors in Germany who were dealing with the virus before it spread far and wide in the U.S., yet the CDC, New England Journal of Medicine, Koch Institute, and WHO SURE had a lot of opinions they assumed to be fact based on something that wasn't even in front of them.

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/27/world/europe/coronavirus-spread-asymptomatic.amp.html&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjT0MCkmqrsAhV5lnIEHU3yCSIQFjAAegQIAhAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw3jN0QH4G7DHN58OiYNhdCe&amp;ampcf=1

This was the first time I began to read things that made a lot more sense than surface transmission or even droplets. Many of these scientists, btw, now also classify droplets from sneezing and coughing as another form of contact transmission - that is to say very rare if it even happens at all. If you dig through their recent twitter feeds, you'll see that some would like new terms like ""inhalation"" used as a descriptor for aerosol transmission.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/well/live/Coronavirus-aerosols-linsey-marr.html

This is an article from when the tide began to turn:

https://newrepublic.com/article/158248/behind-conflicting-advice-coronavirus-safety

By the way, the dissenting voice in this article, Popescu, can be seen on Twitter in the feeds of other scientists on the bleeding edge of how the virus actually spreads ""fact checking"" them and clearly upset that she was very, very wrong. 

It blows me away that the ""science""(!) Loving crowd who believe it's a panacea for ignorance do not realize that science evolves in a way that can be just as destructive and ego driven as a badly run government. Why? Cause humans. Still a human endeavor, still prone to human folly. 

Here's WHO on Facebook from March. Remember, according to Trump (on tape!), even President Xi said the virus was ""in the air""... in early February.

https://m.facebook.com/WHO/posts/fact-covid-19-is-not-airborne-the-coronavirus-is-mainly-transmitted-through-drop/3019704278074935/

This, to me, is by far the greatest summation of the issues the U.S. has come up against more than seemingly any other country. And not all of them are problems that start in the Oval Office (though of course that's one of the biggest issues BY FAR)...

But, your body contains very long lived helper cells which will mount a response to known antagonist and signal the creation of new antibodies to fight an infection or virus. 

There are three main variants of sars-cov-2 with one variant accounting for over 90% (possibly higher but i can't remember the exact number off hand). You can be infected by different variants of the virus, immunity to one does not guarantee immunity to the others, and as such is probably the mechanism by which people are becoming ""re-infected"".

There isn't an easy test for helper immune cells, not like there is for antibodies, mainly because their concentrations are much lower. Currently there is no evidence that sars-cov-2 does not generate helper cells and it should be assumed, until there is evidence to the contrary, that you will have a lasting immunity to the virus if you contract it.

I have not read the literature regarding sars-cov-2 specific vaccines, but in general the purpose of vaccines is to generate t-cell and b-cell activation without the symptoms of the antagonist. A paper in Nature review posits that sars-cov-2 does generate t and b cells based on early literature.

However it's likely that the true number infected falls a good deal lower than that maximum cap, and that on combination with undercounted deaths means COVID likely has a considerably higher fatality rate than the flu.

I don't think reinfection under 1 year is hugely common, but it's common enough that I don't think we can get herd immunity in any appreciable way.  People don't have long term immune response from a low level infection, so most of those people you counted for will not have any appreciable immune response if exposed to a large viral load.  

I'm willing to bet at the 1 year point, so about 4 months from now for NJ/NY, we'll start to see more reinfection.

After completing her senior year at Parshall High School on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in the spring of 2021, she planned to marry her boyfriend of four years and possibly go to college.

But COVID-19 cut Ramirez's life short.

She died on Tuesday, Oct. 6, at Sanford Children's Hospital in Fargo. She is the youngest person to die from COVID-19 so far in North Dakota.

As one of nine children, Ramirez loved to help her siblings and other people, said Susan Three Irons, Ramirez's mother.

""If any of her friends were having problems, Elvia would always be there for them,"" said Three Irons, an enrolled citizen of the Mandan, Hidatsa, Arikara Nation. ""Just to be a sounding board and just for them to have someone to talk to.""

Elvia ""Rose"" Ramirez (back center) died from COVID-19 on Tuesday, Oct. 6. The 17-year-old is the youngest person to die from COVID-19 so far in North Dakota. Special to The Forum
Around Sept. 16, Three Irons said her daughter started to experience headaches, so she recommended Ramirez get tested at a drive-thru testing event in Parshall. Ramirez and her boyfriend tested positive for COVID-19, and a couple of days later Ramirez started to feel ill and thought it might have been due to something she ate.

But by Sept. 22, she was having trouble breathing and Three Irons called an ambulance that took her daughter to Trinity Hospital in Minot, N.D. Three Irons said the hospital was not prepared to take care of her daughter who was displaying increasingly worse COVID-19 symptoms. She said they did not have her on a heart rate monitor and had her only on an IV and supplemental oxygen.

Ramirez by this time had trouble getting up and going to the bathroom, and Three Irons said the hospital was short-staffed on nurses, so she was the one who had to help her daughter from the bed to the bathroom. By that time hospital staff was trying to limit the face-to-face interactions between Three Irons and her daughter so the virus would not spread.

Three Irons eventually made a call to get her daughter airlifted to the Sanford Children's Hospital in Fargo as she saw her condition only worsen. Ramirez was on a ventilator the whole time she was at the children's hospital, and she never came off of it.

Three Irons ended up contracting COVID-19 while visiting her daughter in the hospital. The mother's symptoms became so bad that she had to be hospitalized at a different Fargo hospital, where she remained Thursday, Oct. 8.

The 17-year-old ultimately died due to heart complications, though her mother was not able to be at her side.

As doctors tried to revive Ramirez, health care workers in the room called Three Irons on the phone and told her what was happening. Once doctors declared Ramirez's time of death, they let Three Irons say goodbye to her daughter over the phone.

Like many North Dakotans who have died from COVID-19, Ramirez had underlying health conditions, which in her case were asthma and high blood pressure.

MHA Nation Chairman Mark Fox said Ramirez's death has sent a shockwave through the community and many people are stunned and expressing sympathy and sorrow for her family, schoolmates and friends.

""It's not just a few elderly people in the late stages of their life that are dying here,"" Fox said. ""It is impacting our young, and that means everybody that age or my age or to the oldest member we have, is at some sort of risk from this virus, and we need to take that seriously.""

Three Irons said her daughter loved to draw Japanese anime characters and had a passion for helping people. Ramirez was like a second mom to her eight siblings and she helped many of them log into their distance learning classes at the beginning of the day, Three Irons said.

Even though Ramirez loved taking care of her little siblings, Three Irons said they pretty much dissuaded her from having her own children.

""Her little siblings were kind of more of a deterrent,"" Three Irons recalled, ""and she said she only wanted to be a cat mom.""

Ramirez was an enrolled member of the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community in Phoenix, Ariz., and her family plans to have a traditional burial for her there next week.",,,1602362777,{},g8d9yko,False,t3_j8npe2,False,True,t3_j8npe2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8npe2/17yearold_girl_becomes_north_dakotas_youngest/g8d9yko/,1602366333,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

No reason to panic. Just practise public health guidelines if you believe they're effective.

This creates unstated but strong pressure to say nothing at all because the team will view you as responsible for ending the season.

Thus, there are a lot of students who have been out ""sick"" and also quarantining but not actually getting a test, thus not counting as a positive case.  Their view is that if they just stay at home for a week, until they feel good for a couple of days, they can come back and rejoin the team and the season keeps rolling.

&gt;   I'd say there is more data pointing towards masks being the driving factor of killing spread, look at SE Asia.

That doesn't mean lockdowns didn't work.

What, which part of the lockdown helped the most?  Sure.  Not whether or not lockdowns are effective.  The virus can't magically infect people, if they stay home and wear a mask when they're out only for essentials with reduced exposure along with washing their hands then it's obviously going to be beneficial.

I also have a layman's understanding of this topic. We have epidemiologists and immunologists and virologists who have floated opinions that have later turned out to be wrong, or unlucky guesses. None of us are subject matter experts here, yet, and pretending like we are SHOULD be getting downvotes. It would be nice if everyone spoke from a position of greater humility, but there are a lot of self-appointed authorities who want to bully pulpit anyone who disagrees with them and use downvotes as their weapon.

&gt;The Great Barrington Declaration – As infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists we have grave concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies, and recommend an approach we call Focused Protection. 

&gt;Coming from both the left and right, and around the world, we have devoted our careers to protecting people. Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health. The results (to name a few) include lower childhood vaccination rates, worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings and deteriorating mental health – leading to greater excess mortality in years to come, with the working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden. Keeping students out of school is a grave injustice. 

&gt;Keeping these measures in place until a vaccine is available will cause irreparable damage, with the underprivileged disproportionately harmed.

&gt;Fortunately, our understanding of the virus is growing. We know that vulnerability to death from COVID-19 is more than a thousand-fold higher in the old and infirm than the young. Indeed, for children, COVID-19 is less dangerous than many other harms, including influenza. 

&gt;As immunity builds in the population, the risk of infection to all – including the vulnerable – falls. We know that all populations will eventually reach herd immunity – i.e.  the point at which the rate of new infections is stable – and that this can be assisted by (but is not dependent upon) a vaccine. Our goal should therefore be to minimize mortality and social harm until we reach herd immunity. 

&gt;The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk. We call this Focused Protection. 

&gt;Adopting measures to protect the vulnerable should be the central aim of public health responses to COVID-19. By way of example, nursing homes should use staff with acquired immunity and perform frequent PCR testing of other staff and all visitors. Staff rotation should be minimized. Retired people living at home should have groceries and other essentials delivered to their home. When possible, they should meet family members outside rather than inside. A comprehensive and detailed list of measures, including approaches to multi-generational households, can be implemented, and is well within the scope and capability of public health professionals. 

&gt;Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal. Simple hygiene measures, such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold. Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume. People who are more at risk may participate if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity.",,,1602366980,{},g8dmz7f,False,t3_j8srf4,False,True,t3_j8srf4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8srf4/the_burning_platform_reddits_censorship_of_the/g8dmz7f/,1602371664,1,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

They either want to believe in ""herd immunity"" or they just don't care and want us to open the bars because they are struggling with the current situation.

There is definitely a chance that this coronavirus is like the other coronaviruses- they give a 6-12 month immunity. That's just a fact. You can get Cov-HKU-whatever every year if you catch it. 

I'm not arguing for d o o m I'm stating facts and saying we don't know, but it's definitely very possible. 

People also assume that if you can tolerate accepting a scientific fact, it means you love it and enjoy the bad news. This is infantile. I personally think we are in big trouble because vaccines aren't 100% effective and only half the people will get it anyway. I am very concerned about reinfections in the long run, as this is a new virus and only maybe 15% of the US has been infected. If immunity is like the other coronaviruses and lasts 6 months, if most people are asymptomatic, and we are still doing strong mitigation, we may not see the reinfections easily yet. It could take a year because we are doing good mitigation where I live. This is one of my biggest concerns. I think it's too bad to think about, and if course the downplayers who want to ""go back to normal"" no matter what will aggressively reassure in their comments and downvote rational people who say reinfection is a real possibility in the future. They are doing it for their own reasons. 

They will cite what had happened so far, but the truth is we don't have enough data, and if immunity is 6-12 months we definitely don't have enough data. Places that were hit hard have been very strainer in preventing resurgence, and the community probably had some protection for 3-6 months too.

THIS IS IMPORTANT AND IS A PROPERTY OF MANY OF THE EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCES AND IS A BAD ARGUMENT TO RELY ON.

Let me give you an example: Say for some reason you notice a phenomenon where every week your child comes home with a black eye from someone bullying him. So you want to run an experiment where you think it's some part of his clothes that are causing the bullying but you need to make sure it's not something else (the needing to make sure its not something else is called the practice of [having a ""control""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control) or making sure it's not a [""confounding variable""](https://www.statisticshowto.com/experimental-design/confounding-variable/)). So what you start doing is telling your child to not say anything at school. Another week passes and he still comes back with a black eye. So that confirms he's not being bullied for what he is saying. Then you throw out his wardrobe and purchase new clothes for him. The following week you send him to school. Noticeably this time he comes back with no black eye and it confirms he's been bullied for his clothes. 

If your child told you, ""Dadddd, I have to talk in schoool!! I can't be quiet for an entire week!"" but you still threw out his wardrobe and got the no black eye results: You can't say there's a casual relationship between changing his attire and not getting bullied. This is what is happening in the study you are linking. They have some thing they are measuring (the effective of masks), they're looking retroactively at the data before and after mask usage (before and after changing the wardrobe). And noting that widespread mask usage correlates with a descrease in spread. They can't control for other behavior decreasing the spread (can't control your soon talking at school) and so they can't infer a casual relationship.",,,1602337773,{},g8bk86x,False,t3_j88ym5,False,True,t1_g8bgdli,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j88ym5/white_house_blocked_cdc_from_requiring_masks_on/g8bk86x/,1602337786,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

[],,Darkeyescry22,,,[],,,,text,t2_ulpgm,False,False,[],"&gt;	That’s exactly what I wrote. That is what it means to be a “maximum estimate.” I was calculating the maximum value that the estimate could be. What I said was there is room for a COVID estimate to account for UP TO 11.69x of its current death toll. You, on the other hand, were saying there wasn’t even enough death to account for an estimate that high, when all I ever really said was 2x or 3x, or maybe higher if latent/long-term symptoms prove to be an issue.

There are not enough **excess** death. It’s not possible that all of these people died from covid.

This is like saying that there could be as many as 3 million shark attacks in a year.

&gt;	It’s rough, but that was not my goal, I was calculating the upper bounds of the estimate, and no that is not a much better calculation. A better calculation would be to actually do a similar estimate to the flu estimate with similar methodology and similar goals and then compare the two.

Better not best. The excess deaths give a much better approximation of covid deaths than the overall death count.

&gt;	It’s happening as we speak every time COVID infects someone and increases their chances of an ultimately shortened lifespan through any number of damaging effects from COVID that we are only just beginning to understand. The flu estimate should not be compared to raw death counts.

You keep acting like we have no way to bound this number. We do. And I’ve explained it. It’s unreasonable to assume that dramatically fewer people have died from non-covid causes this year, so the excess death number gives a very good upper limit to the number of deaths caused by covid.

&gt;	Excess deaths are a decent measurement to use here, and they may be a better indicator of the actual covid death count, but it doesn’t make your comparison to the flu estimate any more valid. It suffers from the same exact problems. It is still a raw death count that doesn’t capture the true death toll of the virus, the entire burden of the disease like the flu estimate attempts to do. It does not take long term factors into account like the flu estimate does. The flu estimate factors in a whole lot more deaths because of this. That’s a lot of why it’s ~5x the number of actual deaths, because we have evidence it’s probably ultimately contributing to a lot more deaths than our doctors realize based on scientific analysis. You should still be comparing excess deaths to actual influenza deaths.

This is wrong. The excess deaths takes into account everyone who dies in even the most tangential ways from covid. Even people who shoot themselves because of quarantine are counted in the excess death numbers. The excess deaths are the absolute most liberal estimate of covid deaths. If anything, the flu death estimate is too restrictive to compare to the excess deaths.

&gt;	TL;DR: My criticism of your use of the estimate to compare it even to what you refer to as a “estimated by the excess deaths” is that the flu estimate you’re comparing it to takes a shit ton more data into account than your estimation does. All estimations are not created equal and yours is a very simple estimation that is based on excess deaths and verified death counts alone and I’m sorry but that pales in comparison to the flu estimation. You need to factor in a LOT more data before you can reasonably compare the two numbers.

My estimate is an upper limit. I’m aware it’s not the same as the flu estimate, but the difference does not help your case here. The difference is that the estimate for covid is almost certainly higher than the true number that would be equivalent to the flu estimate.

&gt;	Comparing the actual raw death counts from either disease, however, has none of those faults. The fact of the matter is that when informed medical professionals have reason to believe influenza contributed to someone’s death then they mark it down as such. This is the same with COVID. The verified death counts from either disease are as comparable as they come.

Those numbers are significantly less comparable, like I already explained. Way, way fewer people get tested for the flu than for covid. The idea that the percentage of covid deaths that go unreported is the same as the percentage of flu deaths that go unreported is extraordinarily unlikely.",,,1602345038,{},g8bzv2v,False,t3_j79zty,False,True,t1_g89kjpk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j79zty/coronavirus_killing_three_times_more_people_than/g8bzv2v/,1602345199,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

After more than 225 days of the first reports of the novel coronavirus from China, COVID-19 pandemic is still on surge. The search for an effective and efficient therapeutic and pharmaceutical intervention is as important and urgent now as it was on Day 1. Majority of the efforts in this direction are toward finding small molecule interventions via repurposing or redirecting the therapeutic approaches. This hypothesis proposes a physical intervention approach directed toward rescuing the complex lung pathology observed in COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (CARDS). The loss of content as well as the synthesis and turnover of the surfactant in ARDS has been termed as a “collateral damage.” A synergistic, early stage, cost-effective, pharmaceutically viable, safe, and immediately available solution is hence required. The effectiveness of exogenous surfactant treatment in ARDS has been marred with several limitations as pointed out in various clinical trials and require revised protocols related to surfactant dose and mode of delivery. This hypothesis proposes aerosolized surfactant delivery taking the optimal dosing and coating costs into account along with co-delivery of ambroxol to provide synergistic benefits. Ambroxol is reported to have anti-inflammatory, -oxidant, -viral, and -bacterial activities and has a direct impact on the production and secretion of the surfactant from the alveolar Type 2 cells. If aerosolized, atomized, or nebulized in the form of ambroxol-loaded phospholipid nanovesicles at the early stages of ARDS, depleted surfactant levels may be reinstated and surfactant turnover can be initiated and maintained. The ability to deliver both the components in aerosolized-nebulized form may have a huge impact on alleviating the healthcare burden in low resource settings where the availability of ventilators is limited. In conclusion, the surfactant-ambroxol co-aerosolized intervention approach hypothesized here has implications reaching to clinical and pharmaceutical translation worldwide.",,,1602342029,{},g8btvvo,True,t3_j8lwhb,False,True,t3_j8lwhb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8lwhb/coaerosolized_pulmonary_surfactant_and_ambroxol/g8btvvo/,1602342166,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Human infection with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, leads to a remarkably diverse spectrum of outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal. Recent reports suggest that both clinical and genetic risk factors may contribute to COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. To investigate genetic risk factors, we collected over 500,000 COVID-19 survey responses between April and May 2020 with accompanying genetic data from the AncestryDNA database. We conducted sex-stratified and meta-analyzed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for COVID-19 susceptibility (positive nasopharyngeal swab test, ncases=2,407) and severity (hospitalization, ncases=250). The severity GWAS replicated associations with severe COVID-19 near ABO and SLC6A20 (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, we identified three novel loci with P&lt;5x10-8.

last I read (which was months ago) the theory was a bat may have infected a pangolin which then infected a human. I don't believe scientists have proven that theory and are still searching for the origin.

But you don't have to put as much effort into it as I have to be more comfortable at home.  

I'll grant you, if you are in a cramped small space with a couple of adults trying to WFH and kids trying to do remote learning then it won't be comfortable.

But that is something that is fixable.  If you both worked from home permanently you could move somewhere that has cheaper rent (even if it's just a different part of the same city) and get more space.  

Even two adults working in one spare bedroom together is fine if you setup for it.  A good but affordable $100 basic computer desk.  A decent chair.  Headphones with mics to use for audio.  You could even run a green sheet stapled to a 2x4 frame between you for quasi privacy and being able to better use virtual backgrounds.

You could spend $600 or so and set up a basic WFH situation for two that's still going to be more effective for most than the office in a spare bedroom.  

While your at it, upgrade your internet at home to the fastest possible.  I was surprised how many of my co-workers were on super slow and super expensive plans.  Like $75 per month for 10MB speeds and crap like that.  Basically paying the same per month they were able to get 1GB down.  Even the ones that didn't have that available were able to save money and upgrade speed quite a bit at the same time.

Most people's problem right now that are struggling is that they didn't know ahead of time they would be working from home.  So they weren't prepared   They also know it won't be permanent so they can't justify the long term changes needed to make it better.

I've had some co-workers who are working from their kitchen table, sitting in kitchen chairs all day long (very uncomfortable) working on just their 13 inch laptop screen.

But my main anger stems from the fact that Tegnell was too slow to introduce any measures at all. Denmark for example held their Eurovison song contest on March 7 without audience. Tegnell already knew that the virus was spread by superspreader events but still thought it was okay to have 30 000 people as audience to the Swedish Eurovision song contest in Stockholm on the same date. Add to that two rehersals with a lot of audience too. No wonder Sweden got a lot of virus spread early on in Stockholm and surrounding regions.

when you blow off the doors of media regulation you mostly empower radicals who had previously been suppressed in the media because of costs or because of stricter publication standards.

With the internet the cost to distribute media is so cheap that there's no regulatory factor. They just throw everything they can out there and see what sticks and a couple decades ago that wouldn't have been a practical because you wouldn't have able to afford the endless amount of media distribution to be able to do that easily.

When you deregulate media or a new medium comes out and it's underregulated It's not the mainstream that benefits, it's the extremists and opportunists that see the most benefit.

The same pattern repeats itself even when it's not media and the new market emerges without enough regulation. Opportunistic people are the ones that benefit the most. Sometimes that's good, but a lot of times it winds up being exploitative and predatorial because that's mostly what being opportunistic accomplishes in society. 

It's all good to be opportunistic when it's just you and your little tribe barely surviving, but when there's civilization and a society built around the individual without relies on cooperation, it doesn't work well at all for most of society.

Your rebuttal that the body learns isn't fully accurate, you're ignoring the fact that reinfection can be worse than the first infection. https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/oct/07/covid-second-infection-can-be-worse-than-first-for-some-shows-study-2207097.html

Can bem doesnt mean it will be. Many thousands on teh other hand are asymptomatic. It isnt about immunity perse, this narrative would be flawed to begin with. It is about that our bodies learn how to deal with this like any other virus that are common these days.

&gt;Yes, the ones being run by a president who lies about covid and are being muzzled have different guidelines than the other western democracies.

Nah I am critical of the European policies as well. Only imo Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore handled it well and they have a heavy emphasis on masks. Not 1.5m distance because the latter is bullshit according to their tests.

&gt;Masks were known to be effective, the CDC even knew, the white house shut down the plan for masks to be sent to every american and got rid of the requirement for using them during travel. Why? Worries about scaring people and the economy is my best guess.

In NL the Dutch equal to the CDC still discard masks as not being effective to barely effective. This narrative also strengthened the ""Against"" arguments from people since basically what the government is saying is correct right? This is exactly my issue with this whole pandemic. Dont get me wrong I am not saying it isn't serious.

[],,Deschain53,,,[],,,,text,t2_11z9sn,False,False,[],"The Spanish government has declared a state of emergency in Madrid and the surrounding region to combat rising cases of coronavirus.

It follows a ruling by the high court in Madrid on Thursday, which rejected measures forced on the region by the central government, including the partial lockdown of the Spanish capital and nine neighbouring municipalities.

The move on Friday by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's government takes immediate effect and last for two weeks. It forces the authorities in Madrid to restore travel restrictions that had been brought in by the government but were struck down by the court ruling.
-

&gt;The measures mean all non-essential trips in and out of the capital and nine of its suburbs are prohibited, affecting some 4.8 million people.


&gt;They also mean renewed restrictions on bars and restaurants, stores, sports venues, gyms and hairdressers -- and limit to six the number of people able to meet in public or private.

Spain's interior minister said 7,000 police would be deployed to enforce the restrictions. Officers duly began carrying out checks on Friday.

The government wanted to act quickly as Monday is a public holiday and it wanted to prevent thousands of city-dwellers heading out of the area for the weekend.

Emergency follows court ruling
-

The state of emergency declared by the national government is the latest twist in a tug-of-war with Madrid authorities over efforts to fight the spread of the coronavirus, in a region experiencing one of Europe's worst outbreaks.

It followed Thursday's successful legal challenge by officials in the capital against restrictions imposed by the centre-left national coalition led by Sanchez's Socialist Party and Unidas Podemos.
-

Madrid's conservative regional government opposed the constraints, saying they were draconian and hurt the economy. It argued that more moderate measures were enough to fight the virus.
-

The court agreed, saying such restrictions on freedom could not be introduced without bringing in a state of alarm. 

It ""rejected the ratification (of the measures), because they harmed the fundamental rights and freedoms"" of the 4.5 million inhabitants affected by the partial lockdown, which came into force a week ago, the court said in a statement.

The national government said late on Thursday night that Sánchez had spoken by telephone with Madrid's conservative regional premier Isabel Díaz Ayuso and gave her an ultimatum. Sánchez reportedly told Ayuso that if she did not quickly tighten measures or make a formal request for his national government to declare a state of emergency, then his government would go ahead and declare it anyway.

A state of emergency gives the national government extraordinary powers in time of crises to temporarily limit the constitutional rights of citizens. In this case, it limits their freedom of movement by restarting perimeter controls on Madrid and some nearby towns also suffering from high contagion rates.

COVID-19 power struggle
-

Ayuso had previously been unwilling to implement harsher COVID-19 measures arguing they would cause further damage to the economy, but on Thursday she asked inhabitants not to leave the city.

""We once again ask all residents not to leave Madrid and to follow all health recommendations, especially in the coming days with the extended weekend,"" she said, referring to a national holiday on Monday.

Spain's national government ordered two weeks of new restrictions that started at 10 pm last Friday a week ago, despite pushback from regional officials.

But Madrid's autonomous authority clashed with Spain's central government over the order, saying it would comply but would simultaneously challenge it in the courts.

Madrid is leading the resurgence of the virus in Spain, which has Europe’s highest cumulative caseload — 870,000 confirmed cases since the onset of the pandemic. 

The surge of cases in the Spanish capital has hit hospitals hard, with officials saying that over 40% of the region's ICU capacity is now being used to treat COVID-19 patients.

The bickering between Madrid’s conservative-led government and Sánchez, the leader of the Socialist Party, has angered many Spaniards who find it petty to use a public health tragedy for political skirmishing.",,,1602349038,{},g8c7zve,True,t3_j8nvdn,False,True,t3_j8nvdn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j8nvdn/spain_madrid_state_of_emergency_spanish_police/g8c7zve/,1602349405,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,1602349256.0
