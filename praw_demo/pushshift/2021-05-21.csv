This article suggests otherwise:

While what you claim appears to be true for children, its not true for those over the age of 15 according to the article.  In fact I could not find a single source to back up your claim.

So unless your claim is that people spread misinformation and those in the 20-30 are justifying their decisions based upon this misinformation, then I'm going to have to say you are likely just wrong.

Now if you claim misinformation is causing people to wrongly avoid the vaccine due to under estimating their risk, then I would agree with you.

Also 20-30 isn't a good demographic group as it contains two different generations and often has a clear generational gap.

On Sunday, the country shut schools, restaurants and bars after losing control of outbreaks at the airport and a hospital. Plans to hold the World Economic Forum in August were called off, as was a hoped-for travel bubble with Hong Kong.

The number of recoveries rose to 2,721 after a further 32 coronavirus patients were declared to be clear of the virus,  while the death toll has reached 41, all of whom had been suffering from prior underlying health conditions.

Since the latest COVID-19 wave emerged domestically on April 27, the nation has recorded 2,035 local infections across 30 cities and provinces nationwide, including six fatalities.

Bac Giang and its neighbour Bac Ninh are both home to major foreign industrial parks, with the two provinces topping the case count, with 851 and 419 infections each.

The sickest patient at the hospital was diagnosed with sepsis, cirrhosis, and has an extensive history with alcohol, with experts holding several consultations for the case and issuing warnings regarding the mortality risk.

You don't take the total number of documented breakthrough cases and divide it by the total number of people who have been vaccinated, that doesn't tell you anything. That's like saying that it is 85% effective to not be vaccinated because only about 15% of non-vaccinated people have had a positive COVID test. You have to compare the number of breakthrough cases to the number of cases among non-vaccinated people. Real world results aren't showing a 99.95% effective vaccine, it's showing to more or less match the Phase III results of about 95%.

&gt; Governor Flávio Dino (PCdoB) implemented rules in September 2020 for the containment of the new coronavirus pandemic in the state, which includes social distance and the use of masks.

&gt; The arrival of the president in Açailândia caused agglomeration and turmoil. Without a mask, Bolsonaro greeted supporters who were clustered in a protective grid, which was placed on the spot. The visit comes a day after Maranhão confirmed six cases of Covid's Indian variant (called B.1.617) in Brazil.

[],,That_Classroom_9293,,,[],,,,text,t2_6d87j8ax,False,False,[],"Vaccines taking 10-15 years to be developed is *almost* bullsh*t, and by that I mean that it's true but actually false. Though 1 year was still impressive: let's break down:

Usually vaccines take 1-2 years to begin the trials just for actual bureaucracy, no real study time. Usually vaccines take some time to develop the base, but here we had Sars-CoV1 work as a precedent and borrowed past experience (some months-years work) and got past that, not from scratch. That's most true at least for Adenovirus vaccines, not sure about mRNAs. 

Gathering volunteers is a long process in standard conditions, may as well take 1-2 years, this time it wasn't needed since many people came spontaneously enough to volunteer, since well they found themselves in a pandemic. 

Usually in normal trial reviews, you have vitro first, then animal testing, then Phase 1, just after phase 2, and just later Phase 3. Animal testing was already performed if I got it good, it wasn't needed at the point of our iterations. Phase 1-3s were run normally except that they were done more in parallel than in sequence, if Phase 1 can take from 2-4 years (remember volunteers gathering too), Phase 2 the same, and Phase 3 one year, doing them in parallel takes as most 4 years and not 9. For the same security result. 

What yet helped?

Usually vaccines are engineered with replication of the original virus but inactivating it, that takes time to develop specific industrial processes, if the result is not satisfying, you have to iterate this process and takes time. For mRNA vaccines less of this effort was needed. mRNA is not the virus but just the recipe for it or a piece of it (spike protein in this case). The recipe is alike for all RNA viruses, and that means that processes designed maybe for flu and other diseases could immediately be employed targeting Sars-CoV2 spike protein, while the old fashion guys were designing their inactivated virus processes for Sars-CoV2. mRNA has been in study for the past 30 years, so it's a bit of silly to claim everything happened under a year. 

And as last, contrary to anti-vaxxers beliefs, vaccine designers aren't usually that much financed, and going on with low budget unsurprisingly lengthen the time to reach the same task. Billions have been thrown this time in a record fast bureaucracy, if this was done before I wonder how many mRNA vaccines we could already have gotten. 

What was bureaucracy once a issue this time wasn't. Money was thrown. Volunteers ran to researchers, Phase I–III were parallelised, mRNAs fastened a usually slower approach, Adenovirus did the trick less well but yet better than classic vaccines. A lot of effort from the scientific community has been taken all at once, and more than 100 vaccines were fastly started in studies. 

What has been a scientific miracle had enough of beaten road to be performed, so it's surprising and enough satisfying but not unbelievable and/or, for the most skeptics, dangerous.

______
In the months after she first got sick with COVID-19 in March 2020, Jennifer Minhas developed a cluster of mysterious symptoms.  

""I had profound fatigue,"" she says, along with brain fog, headaches and a rapid heartbeat, especially when she changed positions from lying down to standing up.

""Just standing up to make a sandwich, my heart rate would be 120,"" recalls Minhas, a 54-year-old nurse who lives in San Diego. A normal heartbeat for an adult ranges between 60 and 100 beats per minute.

Doctors ordered tests to rule out heart disease. They all came back normal. The doctors couldn't find anything, Minhas says.

About the same time she developed another strange symptom that offered a clue to her condition.

""I would wake up in the middle of the night with burning hands and feet, and I would look down and my feet would be bright red,"" Minhas says. In addition, she continued to feel a tightness in her chest, and the brain fog was so intense at times, she says, she couldn't remember a four-digit code for her phone.

People With Severe COVID-19 Have Higher Risk Of Long-Term Effects, Study Finds
Her symptoms became so severe that she stopped working. ""Normally I'm very active. I used to play tennis and go to the gym,"" she says. But all this activity came to a halt.

Yet doctors could not explain what was wrong. At first, her primary care doctor thought it was anxiety.

""It was disconcerting,"" Minhas says, and ""lingering way too long without a proper answer."" But she persevered, determined to ""dig in and look for answers.""

And months later, in late 2020, a breakthrough: A group of cardiologists at the University of California, San Diego helped lead her to a diagnosis of a mercurial and little-known condition: postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, or POTS, a blood circulation disorder.

A growing number of people are facing mountains of frustration over health problems that linger after COVID-19 with no clear path to improvement. But for a subset of people with what's known as ""long COVID"" — mostly women such as Minhas — a POTS diagnosis offers a road map to treatment options and relief from their often-debilitating symptoms.

COVID-19 brings new cases, new awareness

The doctors told Minhas that they had begun to see other patients after COVID-19 who had developed similar symptoms. They explained to her that an issue with her nervous system was causing her heart to race, usually upon standing — a signature feature of the syndrome — and the circulatory problems.

POTS is a type of dysautonomia, which stems from dysfunction in the autonomic nervous system. That's the part of the nervous system that works automatically to regulate body functions such as breathing, heart rate, blood pressure and digestion.

Don't be surprised if you've never heard of POTS. ""There's been a lack of awareness"" of the condition, even within the medical community, says Dr. Tae Chung, a POTS specialist at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore.

The syndrome is estimated to affect about 1 million to 3 million people in the U.S. — most commonly women, young adults and adolescents. But the COVID-19 pandemic has brought new attention and many new diagnosed cases.

Now, where does that leave J&amp;J? J&amp;J had the most robust data against the variants in its trial. 1 shot of J&amp;J had an efficacy of 64% against the South African variant.

masks : definitely wear a mask, always. And definitely N95 class mask

Bielcor B201 for comfort (doesn't have a nose clip but fits tight all the time) . You can wear it all day and barely feel it. bielcor.com

3M9502+ for cost [magidgloves.com](https://magidgloves.com) requires a nose clip accurate adjustment, it may take 2 or 3 tries but after that it seals well

3M Aura (all) expensive

all headbands. I wouldn't trust any earloops 

they can be rotated up to 5 times (each mask) for an average daily use of 8 hours

get paper bags (the brown ones) and dispose the mask in it at the end of the day. Let the mask sit for at least 72 hours , write the day on the paper bag. Use a new one the next day and repeat at the end of the day. Start rotating when the new ones are all used.

if you work on a desk in a room with others I'd suggest a small air purifier on the desk, ventilate the room (open doors and windows and let the air circulate)

hand sanitizers and always carry a pocket one (get a neck strap and attach it and have it with you all the time.

&gt; GENEVA — Deaths from Covid-19 and Covid-related causes are likely to be two to three times the number that countries have recorded in their official data, the World Health Organization said on Friday

&gt; Some six to eight million people may have now died from Covid-19 or its effects since the start of the pandemic, compared with 3.4 million deaths recorded in countries’ official reporting, Dr. Samira Asma, assistant director of the W.H.O.’s data division, told reporters.

&gt;The W.H.O. also estimates that at least three million people may have died from Covid-19 in 2020, compared with 1.8 million recorded in official data, the W.H.O. reported in annual statistics released on Friday.

&gt;The W.H.O. based its assessment on a statistical model that estimates the excess deaths attributable to Covid-19. The technique involves taking the total number of officially recorded deaths and then subtracting the number of deaths that would have been expected on the basis of previous mortality trends if the pandemic had not occurred.

&gt;On that basis, the W.H.O. said it estimated that 1.1 million to 1.3 million people in 53 European countries died from Covid-19 in 2020, roughly double the number recorded in official data. The organization also calculates that, over the same period, 1.3 million to 1.5 million people died in 35 countries in the Americas, compared with the 900,000 deaths officially recorded.

&gt;The huge discrepancy between the W.H.O.’s estimates and official data underscores the limited capacity of many countries to test their populations for the coronavirus and other weaknesses in official health data. For example, some Covid victims had died before being tested and their deaths did not appear in official reporting, William Msemburi, a W.H.O. data analyst said.

&gt;The W.H.O. will present its statistics to the annual meeting of its policymaking assembly in Geneva next week. The numbers will help make the case for countries to invest urgently in bolstering data systems and their capacity to monitor and report health developments.

We already accept that vaccinations are required for travel to places that have active infectious disease outbreaks. You’ve had to have a yellow card in your passport to travel to places that have Yellow Fever for decades.  

We also already require vaccination to participate in some services for the protection of others. Children transferring to new schools have to present their vaccination records, and unless are prohibited from starting classes unless they have a valid exemption. Immigrants have to prove full and current vaccination to move to the country. 

We also already are tracked to whatever extent this would allow people to be tracked. Who has been vaccinated is in the database. Travel movements are logged based on presenting ID at the airport domestically. 

As for Constitutionality, the right to freedom of movement has always included qualification, and one of those justified qualifications has always been quarantine for public health. Additionally, so far I haven’t seen a proposal for an absolute prohibition of travel without a vaccine passport. Mainly a prohibition on air travel.

Liberty seems to be a code word here for not having a societal duty of care to look out for each other, and belief that people have an absolute right to receive all of the conveniences and benefits of being part of a society, and availing themselves to those as selfishly as they desire, without having to give back or sacrifice for that society in any way. 

Vaccine passports only need to exist because there are a lot of people out there who have actively proven that they do not have any desire to make small sacrifices to protect the most vulnerable members of our society. In this case, people who may be immunocompromised and can’t get the vaccine, or people who haven’t yet had the ability to get one.

On top of that a recent study has shown that again 2 dose mRNA vaccines produce far more antibodies than the J&amp;J vaccine which produce less than a natural infection. Antibodies were also shown to be correlated with efficacy, so clearly some vaccines perform better than others.

The ‘modeling studies’ you are probably referring to are studies that use epidemiological models to try and predict the evolution of the pandemic and how different policies affect this evolution. Researchers basically have an explicit mathematical model of these phenomena in mind, and they then calibrate it to the data to make predictions. You are correct that these have not had a great track record so far.

When people say ‘statistical model’ they can be referring to those epidemiological models I mentioned, but they can also refer to things like Ordinary Least Squares regression and other extremely standard statistical procedures. There is not a study out there that doesn’t use these “models”. Even Randomized Control Trials, like the ones that provided evidence of the effectiveness of the COVID vaccines used these models and would be considered “modeling studies”.

By the way, the paper in the article is not using one of those epidemiological models with ‘bad track records’. Instead, the methods being used are more akin to linear regression.",,,1621705885,{},gz2ry25,False,t3_nhj8cw,False,True,t1_gz2959m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nhj8cw/rapid_school_reopenings_may_have_led_to_thousands/gz2ry25/,1621787819,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
