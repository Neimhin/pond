Biden said some of those doses would be delivered sooner than anticipated, guaranteeing enough supply by the end of May to vaccinate 200 million people under the two-dose protocols.

...

&gt; “By the time we get to April, that will be what I would call . . . ‘open season,’ namely, virtually everybody and anybody in any category could start to get vaccinated,” Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious-disease expert, said Thursday on NBC’s “Today” show.

...

&gt;Additional doses are also expected to come from Johnson &amp; Johnson, which submitted its application for a single-shot coronavirus vaccine to U.S. regulators earlier this month. If approved, the easy-to-store vaccine would further augment supply, although production setbacks are expected to limit availability until the spring. It’s also possible that vaccine experts may only recommend the vaccine for people in certain age groups.


So I think three pretty important notes from the article here...

* By the end of May there should be enough from Pfizer and Moderna alone to vaccinate 200 million in the US.
* Dr.Fauci says by April anyone who wants a vaccine should be able to get it.
* Additional vaccines are expected from J&amp;J to buff these numbers.

&gt;The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine offers as little as 10% protection against the Covid variant first seen in South Africa, researchers have suggested.

&gt;Scientists who conducted a small-scale trial of the vaccine’s efficacy said it showed very little protection against mild to moderate infection, though they expressed hope that – in theory – it would still offer significant protection against more serious infection.

The trial that produced this result was small, but alarming enough for the South African government to halt administering the Oxford vaccine.

You're not wrong about distributed production though.  Granted, the Serum Institute in India is the largest vaccine producer in the world, IIRC, and they are concentrating on supplying developing countries, as well as providing vaccine to India.

The ""problem"" with distributed production, is what different production facilities can produce.  Specifically Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA vaccines don't use a traditional vaccine manufacturing process.  One vaccine candidate (Medicago) uses plants to produce a ""Virus-like particle"" also.  There are several old-school inactivated virus vaccines in development as well.  

One consideration though is the possibility of licensing.  One example, I believe in Canada, Providence Therapeutics has mRNA vaccine production capacity that *could* be used to produce the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, but isn't.

 I think that if successful vaccine developers were required to *licence* their formulae to their customer countries, you could have orders of magnitude more production.  **Especially** when a more traditional vaccine is approved, as there *is* all sorts of production capacity that should be able to be quickly repurposed.",,,1613108453,{},gn139vg,False,t3_lhueqw,False,True,t1_gn0w5u4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lhueqw/biden_to_announce_his_administration_has_secured/gn139vg/,1613112789,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The hope is  light green with regard to the vaccine against covid-19, which  has been  developed at the University of Copenhagen, and which is  expected to  start being tested on humans at the end of this month.

The  vaccine is based on a new technology that the researchers at the   university have been working on for 15 years, and they themselves   believe that there is reason to believe that the vaccine has something   special to offer - if it succeeds in the clinical trials and when up to   the population.

""I  expect that  our vaccine will activate a strong response from the immune  system and  also work significantly better than many others against new  virus  variants, ie mutants,"" says Ali Salanti, professor at the  Department of  Immunology and Microbiology at the University of  Copenhagen.

The   expectation is supported by the American professor Bryce Chackerian   from the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, who researches   vaccines based on similar technology and who has followed the work at   the University of Copenhagen closely.

“I   believe that their vaccine has several advantages over other vaccines   that have already been approved or are in the late stages of clinical   trials. One of them is  that it indicates that their vaccine will  provoke a very strong response  from the immune system, ”he writes in an  email about his expectations  for a high effect.

New  virus variants such as the South African seem to be less sensitive to  antibodies, he continues; the vaccines simply risk being worse, as seen  with Astrazeneca's vaccine against the South African mutant.

“But  if you can produce very high levels of antibodies, then it's less  worrying. So there is potential for the Copenhagen vaccine to better  protect against new virus strains, ”writes Bryce Chackerian.

Søren   Riis Paludan, professor at the Department of Biomedicine at Aarhus   University, also believes that the Danish vaccine has potential.

He has seen data from the experiments in monkeys and mice, and ""it looks promising"", he says:

“After   the first wave of vaccines, which are the ones we have now, there will   be another wave where some vaccines will be targeted at new virus   variants; some will provide better immunity and some will work better in  the weak groups we do not succeed in vaccinating now. In that race, I  think it is a strong candidate to become one of the best. ”

However, he emphasizes that everything is ""theory"", as long as the clinical trials have not been completed.

The  Statens Serum Institut is also developing a vaccine against covid-19.  It is based on a different technology than the vaccine offer from the  University of Copenhagen. The  work is led by chief physician Anders  Fomsgaard, who states that the  team is currently working on preparing  the first clinical trials, which  are expected to begin in the autumn.",,,1613117730,{},gn1ervi,True,t3_li6sbk,False,True,t3_li6sbk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/li6sbk/promising_danish_vaccine_on_the_way_to_clinical/gn1ervi/,1613117782,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,True

Two things. 

Firstly, that hasn't yet been shown to be true for the AZ one (unless I've missed a recent story), which is the main one we're currently using in the UK. From the small trials that were done, nobody got hospitalised, but the people were all of an age where the risk of hospitalisation was already low. I'm really hoping it's true, but there's been nothing conclusive one way or another yet.

Secondly, while reducing the chance of hospitalisation and death in the vaccinated is clearly _very_ important, it's not the only purpose. The other key purpose is to vastly reduce the spread. That's important for a few reasons. It reduces the risk to those who haven't been vaccinated - which is going to include much of the world for quite some time, and even to those who have (a small chance of an individual getting seriously ill is still a fairly major problem at the macro level as long as the virus is still spreading wildly in the community), and it reduces the risk of further mutations which could then evade the vaccines.

My only conclusion is that a number of the folk who patrol this sub have a specific worldview and are too dense to perceive anything that falls outside it.

It's pretty simple in this case. We reach a point where most 65+ get vaccinated, at that point because of the effectiveness of the vaccines at mitigating serious disease (currently reported at 100% effectiveness for that), the demographics of deaths will shift substantially, towards the oldest among those not yet vaccinated. Because that cohort includes adults with young families, when those breadwinners pass, it will be a comparatively huge tragedy.

(To be clear, any loss of life from this disease is a tragedy. It's a tragedy for a child to lose their grandparent. It's a tragedy for an older person to lose their retirement. I'm just musing that for some kids, they relied on their parents to raise them - a very fundamental thing.

901 covid-19 deaths for 2020.

[https://www.princegeorgematters.com/local-news/bc-records-901-covid-19-deaths-for-2020-51983-total-cases-3226896](https://www.princegeorgematters.com/local-news/bc-records-901-covid-19-deaths-for-2020-51983-total-cases-3226896)

Most of the 901 covid-19 deaths were the extremely elderly with multiple co-morbidities.  Most of the overdose deaths were much younger, so the amount of years lost is much greater.  

There are a lot of excess deaths not attributed to covid-19.

&gt; Since the beginning of the pandemic, there have been approximately 50 deaths attributed to COVID-19 among  Canadians under the age of 45. Given that over 440 more deaths than  expected among this age group were reported from September to November  alone, these excess deaths cannot be attributed directly to COVID-19.   
&gt;  
&gt;Excess  mortality among this younger age group has been observed since May and  has affected mostly males. From May to November, an  estimated 8,764 deaths were reported among Canadians aged 0 to 44 years,  an excess of 1,691 deaths.

If we also assume that every 4 weeks a new generation of completely unique individuals tests positive for COVID, then over 12 months you have about 60% of the population having tested positive.

If we assume that every 8 weeks a new generation of completely unique individuals tests positive, then that's 30% of the population.

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

This once again demonstrates why the EU doesn't work.

It is easy to say ""just spend the f*ing money"", and it is... if you live in a rich Western country where you paid that much for a craft coffee once.

The EU _also_ includes places like Bulgaria where a significant number of people still use a horse and cart, the price of two Pfizer doses is half a monthly wage and the closest thing to cryogenic storage is the village butcher's fridge. When the EU buys vaccines, member countries have to cough up the money themselves to buy them _from_ the EU, and some of them really did not want to deal with the Pfizer one.

So what we ended up with is a good old compromise no one is happy with. Germany wanted Pfizer vaccines, Bulgaria wanted cheap vaccines, France wanted French vaccines, Belgium wanted facemasks, and ultimately we arrived at the ""strategy of distributed risk"" that just translates to keeping everyone moderately unhappy so no one would be pissed enough to leave.

If you think ""well maybe Germany should buy vaccines for everyone else out of their deep pockets"", you are thinking like a European citizen.

The two main arguments being ""What governments *wants* to tank the economy or be this unpopular?"" and ""Well it's to stop hospitals from being overloaded this time, it won't happen again.

1) Can anyone name a single government ever who wouldn't **love** more authoritative power over its citizens? No right to protest, no leaving the house at certain times. And the economy is just tanking for the poor and middle classes. Rich executives are making a killing, and politicians are still paying themselves handsomely. What do they care if every small business goes bankrupt? They're being lobbied and paid for by Wal-Mart, Netflix, Amazon, etc., not John who owns the bar that's been in the neighborhood for 35 years who can't afford another month of zero service. Lockdowns put all of the risk onto the working class to 'save the world' and none on the rich -- it's literally perfect for them. Hell, they aren't even following their own rules. How many politicians and health ministers have been caught on exotic vacations and private parties since telling everyone else what to do?

2) Okay, yes, stopping hospital overload is an emergency. But hospital capacity and staff has been dwindling because of constant cuts over years to the system.

This loss of cross-neutralization was particularly notable against B1.351 with potential implications for vaccine efficacy in populations where this VOC dominates and when only moderate levels of S antibodies are generated after vaccination.

You keep saying that America is larger than a country. Re-read what you wrote if you need to. What do you think that means? That a country has to be a certain size? That's a very conceited view considering that half of the world's population live in countries that are larger than the typical European country. It's so big headed of you to keep claiming that America is larger than a country. Why shouldn't I say that European countries are too small and they should be called states instead? I don't, cause I'm not an asshole. If your country insists it's called a country, it's a country. That's it. I gave you a better way of phrasing what you intended, but you keep sticking to this idea that America isn't a country cause it's too large.

&gt; pretty much a whole continent like the USA is

No we're not. Canada and Mexico take up a large chunk of the landmass.

&gt; I know it is called a country, but it can't be thought of as a country.

How mad would you be if someone told you your country was too small and should be called a state instead? Or maybe even just a city.

This post gets into more science-y shit that I don’t fully always grasp. But it’s kind of intuitive: if people who got Covid retain immunity after many months, and if the vaccines result in an immune response even better than natural immunity, then the vaccine immunity should be retained as long or longer than natural immunity.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR MY PATIENTS: 

* There will be no vaccinations given without an appointment. \*\*If the computerized algorithm selects you, you will receive an invitation to schedule via MyCSLink or text message. \*\*
* I do not have the ability to influence the invitations or “put you on a list.” 
* Cedars-Sinai will continue this process until all patients 65 and older have been vaccinated, but this regrettably could take months depending on supply.

That's an excellent question. To your point, with all due respect to the epidemiologists' perspective of risk vs. gain in regards to vaccination vs. in-person schooling that's a question better left to us social scientists and it's one without a clear-cut answer (currently).

We've had more generations of humans without the ""benefits"" of formal education than those with it. A critical perspective of formal education exists among sociologists and it's not a minority position.

It's not entirely clear the kinds of socialization people believe children will be learning while buttoned up and barricaded.

Let's keep in mind that the push for compulsory education was a function of the industrial revolution and not for child development purposes.

Highly contagious COVID-19 strain found at Michigan prison

Angie Jackson

Detroit Free Press

Prisoners and staff at a state correctional facility in west Michigan are now being tested daily for the coronavirus  after the detection of the highly contagious B.1.1.7 variant.

The Michigan Department of Corrections said in a notice sent to prisoners and staff this week that a case of the B.1.1.7 variant was confirmed Monday at Bellamy Creek Correctional Facility in Ionia. The variant, which first appeared in the United Kingdom in September, spreads more easily than other previously identified strains. 

Byron Osborn, president of the Michigan Corrections Organization representing 6,000 corrections officers, said the person with the confirmed case of the variant is a staff member. He said the MDOC has not said whether the employee is an officer or works in a different role at Bellamy Creek. 

""Basically, it’s the worst news we could’ve gotten,"" Osborn said. ""The fact that it's made its way in but then the additional anxiety and stress that this places on the employees and the prisoner population at this facility.""

Chris Gautz, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections, said Wednesday that additional test results were pending and no other cases of the variant have been confirmed in the prison system.

As of Tuesday, 485 prisoners at Bellamy Creek had tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 since the pandemic began, and 98 of those cases are active infections. One prisoner has died. The department reports that 101 staff at the facility have tested positive throughout the pandemic. 

The message that the department sent late Monday said prisoners and employees at Bellamy Creek will be tested daily with a rapid test. If a rapid test result comes back positive, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test will be taken and sent to a state lab for testing for the variant. 

This testing regimen will also apply to some prisoners and staff at Duane Waters Health Center in Jackson and Macomb Correctional Facility in Lenox Township. Before the variant was detected at Bellamy Creek, the MDOC transferred several prisoners who had tested positive for the virus and also have comorbidities from the prison in Ionia to Duane Waters and Macomb ""so they could have access to appropriate care if they began experiencing more severe symptoms,"" the department said. Those prisoners, as well as prisoners and staff in COVID-19 housing units at Macomb and Duane Waters, will be tested daily. 

At this time, Gautz said, ""it is not the plan"" to transfer prisoners with  COVID-19 to housing units dedicated to positive cases at other facilities ""because right now it's too risky with this variant out there to be introducing them to anywhere else."" He said facilities are being instructed to have a plan to isolate prisoners positive for the virus on their grounds.

It wasn't immediately clear whether prisoners who test positive for the variant will be separated from other prisoners with COVID-19 among whom the variant has not been confirmed. 

The department said it is working on providing accommodations to staff in the event that they need to isolate from household members. 

As of Tuesday, the department reported 24,707 COVID-19 cases among prisoners and 3,521 staff cases across the state since March. There have been 136 prisoner deaths. Four employees have died. 

Active infections among the prisoner population are down since the fall, when the number of active COVID-19 cases reached a new high and continued to climb, with more than 7,700 active cases at one point in mid-December. There were 833 active cases among prisoners across the prison system as of Tuesday. 

Prisoners and staff are tested weekly at facilities with at least one active case. Per a recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the department does not test people as part of its mass testing efforts for 90 days after their initial positive test. 

The new daily testing for B.1.1.7 variant surveillance will include people who have tested positive in the past 90 days, according to MDOC's notice to prisoners and staff. 

Michigan's first case of the variant was confirmed in Washtenaw County in January. There are now 61 known cases of B.1.1.7 in 10 counties, according to information provided Wednesday by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. 

Cases of B.1.1.7 have been confirmed in Calhoun, Charlevoix, Eaton, Kalamazoo, Kent, Macomb, Sanilac, Van Buren, Washtenaw and Wayne counties and the city of Detroit. Cases are tracked by county of residence.

Current data on the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines show that they are effective against the B.1.1.7. variant, Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state's chief medical executive, said at a news conference Tuesday. 

""Viruses change and mutate when they have the opportunity to spread, so getting vaccinated will not only slow the spread of the usual COVID-19 virus, but it will also prevent the virus from getting the opportunity to mutate as it spreads from person to person,"" she said.

Under the state's guidance for prioritization groups, prison staff and incarcerated people 65 and older are currently eligible for the vaccine. 

About 4,000 prisoners have received a first dose of the vaccine since late January. Of that number, 1,322 people were 65 or older. The department receives the vaccine in shipments of 100, Gautz said, and any doses remaining after the vaccine has been offered to those who meet the age guideline are then provided to younger prisoners with the greatest health needs.

The department doesn't know exactly how many employees have gotten the vaccine. Staff who get their shot from a health department aren't required to report to the MDOC that they've been vaccinated, Gautz said.

Osborn said from the general reports he's heard, ""it doesn’t sound like a large percentage of staff have opted to take the vaccine at this point.""

Bellamy Creek was the site of a vaccination clinic Friday. The Department of Corrections said in the notice issued Monday that there were no reports of anyone at the clinic being exposed to the variant, ""but out of an abundance of caution you are reminded to follow the guidelines for social distancing and handwashing. Should we be made aware of any exposures involving employees, they will be notified.""

Additionally, the state health department  issued an emergency order Wednesday requiring daily testing of prison staff for at least 14 days when a COVID-19 outbreak of ""special concern,"" including cases resulting from variants, is declared at a facility.

[],,chilladipa,,,[],,,,text,t2_6z8harzu,False,False,[],"Three weeks after Israel started giving second doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to the first eligible population group, data watchers are starting to see a hopeful sign: decreasing deaths from COVID-19 in the targeted age group.

Cases, hospitalizations, and critical illness have also decreased among people aged 60 years and older, which is the group that was prioritized to receive vaccinations first, said Eran Segal, PhD, a computational biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel, in an interview for an upcoming episode of Medscape's Medicine and the Machine podcast. The vaccination benefit is ""striking"" and bolsters confidence in the potency of mRNA vaccines against the B117 strain of SARS-CoV-2, which is dominant in Israel, tweeted Eric Topol, MD, Medscape's editor-in-chief and co-host of the podcast with Abraham Verghese, MD.

Since Israel's latest peak in mid-January, cases among people aged 60 years and older have declined by 55%; hospitalizations have declined by 40%; critical illnesses, by 35%; and deaths, by 35%, Segal said. The same trends are not present for people younger than 60, who began to be vaccinated later.

Even with these positive trends, the pandemic is still far from over in Israel. New weekly cases affect more than 0.5% of the population, Segal said, ""a big number.""

Moreover, he estimates that the B.117 variant, which was first identified in the United Kingdom, now accounts for 80% to 90% of all cases.

About 10% of people older than 60 haven't been vaccinated yet, Segal says, and progress has stalled over the past 4 to 5 weeks.

The number of severely ill people in intensive care also remains high, at around 1200 patients. The Israeli Ministry of Health had previously set the threshold for the number of severely ill patients above which hospitals could no longer provide adequate treatment at 800 patients. During the interview, Segal told Topol and Verghese that the high number of patients is compromising patient survival.

In research posted to the preprint server medRxiv.org in January, Segal and colleagues reported that care may have been inadequate even during periods in which the number of severely ill patients was not as high as the 800-patient threshold. In-hospital mortality rates were about 25% higher during periods in which there were more than 500 severely ill patients, compared with periods when there were fewer than 500 patients in intensive care units. They determined that the higher mortality rate could not be attributed to changes in the patient population.

""COVID mortalities could have been saved if these same people, given their age, given their status at hospitalization, were to come during periods of lower load on the hospitals,"" Segal said. ""That really took a death toll.""

His group believes that in the current period of strain, mortality rates have been 30% higher.

Jan 2020 my mom got ill and was in the hospital. The doctor called me and I told him the care center we had picked and said I would get the insurance approved. He said no, I will not send anyone to a care center in Feb 2020. I said explained I had kids and was not in the position to be a caregiver. He said I will not let a patient go to a care center. Everyone caring for my mom, nurses, social worker, PT, all said we are not letting people go to care centers.  So I since Feb 2020 I became a caregiver  and I am not the only one, 4 other families in this neighborhood got the same call. These 4 people have helped me so much because we all are overwhelmed with how hard caring for a parent is. 

My Uncle was stuck in a care center in MA where over 50 people died, NY/MA and UT were so different. The doctor in Utah could have easily said okay , I will send your mom to the care center. There was room, the insurance would have paid 100%, it would have been super easy. Instead that doctor and the hospital spent three days talking me into helping my mom return to her home and have a full time caregiver. This saved so many lives. This area of Utah has only 1 hospital for a large 3 state region and does overflow for Vegas so on a non COVID day it is near 100% full so there was no extra space. Per capita there are way less hospital beds and WAY less doctors in this region(many fields have 1 doctor for over 500k people some have none).",,,1613110525,{},gn166ta,False,t3_li04tq,False,True,t1_gn0m521,/r/Coronavirus/comments/li04tq/9000_covid19_hospital_patients_were_discharged_to/gn166ta/,1613114066,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

For example, our Pfizer doses were going to be provided by their US production facility, but someone signed an executive order forbidding vaccine exports.

That's okay, Pfizer will just provide them from their Belgian facility.  Oh wait, they need to upgrade that one because now it's servicing the whole world.  Oh, and the EU wants Pfizer to use EU produced doses to fulfill their EU orders first.  

As other vaccines come online, these problems around vaccine nationalism should abate, and Canada does have domestic vaccine production capacity, although none of it is being used for Covid-19 vaccines right now.

Partly this is because mRNA vaccines are pretty new^1, but it's still galling.
Medicago, a Quebec company, has a vaccine candidate in Stage 3 testing right now for example.  If approved, it will be produced in their North Carolina facility, because that was funded and built around 10 years ago.

Remember that pandemic preparedness index from a few years ago, where the US ranked first in the world?  This is part of why the vaccine production capacity in the US is so high, years and years of investment.  Trump may have trashed a bunch of the Pandemic preparedness, but there was still a lot of depth.

---

^1 Providence Therapeutics has some mRNA vaccine production capability, but they are busy developing their own vaccine candidate, maybe available in another 6 months instead of licensing and producing Moderna or Pfizer vaccine.

As an outsider, this whole vaccine race seems to have a *stupid* amount of ""NIH"" (Not Invented Here) going on.  Of *course* someone's vaccine candidate is going to be approved first.  Why not license it?  Why not require/reimburse developers for using their capacity to produce already approved vaccines while theirs are still in testing?

“If we relax too quickly without seeing the effect of each stage of relaxation, we may do what we’ve done before and relax too much, see a surge in case numbers, and still need to tighten up measures again.

“My best guess is, though, my fervent hope is, certainly, by this time next year, we will be basically back to normal. I mean, without any significant degree of the current controls in place.”

It has emerged that social distancing restrictions will have to remain in place until at least the autumn to reduce the transmission of the virus under plans being considered by ministers.

The Times understands that the government’s route out of lockdown is based on the assumption that people will have to wear facemasks and remain a metre apart for months. Scientists believe that the restrictions may need to be in place until the end of the year.

“The thinking is that social distancing will need to be in place for a long time to come,” a Whitehall source said. “It has repercussions for the scale of any reopening. Restaurants, pubs and offices will all need to be Covid-secure.”

Ministers believe it will allow other controls to be relaxed. A government source said: “The more restrictions we have in place like social distancing rules the more we can do in terms of easing.”

It is not clear whether the policy will remain in place for different households, meaning that grandparents will still be unable to hug their grandchildren. Sources said that a variety of options were under discussion.

Yesterday Boris Johnson stuck to his plans to reopen schools on March 8 after scientists warned that cases were still too high. Members of Sage raised concerns that high transmission rates could increase the risk of mutations.

Victoria Atkins, the safeguarding minister, said that the government would set out its roadmap for easing lockdown restrictions on February 22.",,,1613155979,{},gn36o5p,True,t3_lihub4,False,True,t1_gn36n7u,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lihub4/r_number_falls_below_1_for_first_time_since_july/gn36o5p/,1613157746,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The infection survey shows the percentage of people testing positive has decreased in all regions of England, except for the southwest where the rate of decline appeared to have levelled off, although the ONS said: “Caution should be taken in over-interpreting any small movements in the latest trend.”

Crofts added: “The percentage of positive cases compatible with the new UK variant also continues to decrease in all regions of England except for Yorkshire and the Humber, the East Midlands and the South West where trends remain uncertain.”

The government said the R estimate for the UK, a number indicating how many people each infected person will pass the virus on to, was between 0.7 and 0.9, and that the outbreak was shrinking by between 2 and 5 per cent each day.

The R estimate was below 1 in every region of England, a spokeswoman said, meaning “we are confident the epidemic is shrinking across all NHS England regions”.

She added: “However, prevalence of the virus remains high, so it remains important that everyone continues to stay at home in order to keep the R value down, protect the NHS and help save lives.”

Professor Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, a key architect of the first lockdown, said he was hopeful that primary schools would be able to reopen next month with infection rates falling faster than he anticipated. He was optimistic that the UK could avoid another lockdown, as long as the present restrictions were lifted carefully and vaccines worked well.

“We’re in a better place than I might have anticipated a month ago,” he told Politico’s Westminster Insider podcast.

“The lockdown has really driven down cases quite fast. They’re basically halving about every 17 days at the moment or so, and that means in a month’s time — the prime minister’s talked about potentially reopening schools, we might have some bandwidth to do that, at least primary schools.

“And if we continue to see a continued decline without large outbreaks, then perhaps [we can start] to relax other aspects of society the following month.”

He said that the “real-world effectiveness” of Covid-19 vaccines would be a key factor in how fast Britain could return to a more normal way of life.

“I’m hopeful it will be the final lockdown — so long as we are relatively cautious in coming out of this lockdown,” he said.",,,1613155968,{},gn36n7u,True,t3_lihub4,False,True,t1_gn36mgz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lihub4/r_number_falls_below_1_for_first_time_since_july/gn36n7u/,1613157731,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Coronavirus cases are continuing to decline across the UK with the government estimating that the R number has fallen below one for the first time since July.

According to the Office for National Statistics infection survey there were an estimated 695,400 people in England that had Covid-19 in the week ending February 6, down 18 per cent from the week before.

It is the first time the figure has been below 700,000 since the week ending December 18.

The government estimate of the R number, tracking the transmission rate of the virus, fell below one for the first time since July, meaning scientists are confident the outbreak is shrinking.

The current halving time of the virus (the time it takes for the number of new infections to halve) is thought to be between 14 and 17 days.

Government scientific advisers believe that if this continues, aided by the vaccine programme, then low case numbers that could result in looser restrictions may be achieved in the next two to three months.

As of Wednesday, 13,509,108 people in the UK had received a first dose of coronavirus vaccine, suggesting that 15 million doses could be reached as soon as tomorrow.

Sarah Crofts, senior statistician for the survey, said: “Rates of infection remain high but have continued to decrease in England and across the UK, with Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all seeing decreases in the estimated percentage of people testing positive for Covid-19.”

The figures reported by the infection survey remain much higher than those picked up by the testing system and reported daily by the government. In the week ending February 6, that figure was about 109,500 for England.

The discrepancy can partly be explained by the ONS survey repeatedly swabbing a representative sample of households, whether symptomatic or not, and so picking up more cases than NHS Test and Trace, which relies on people developing symptoms and coming forward.

Government scientists believe that the increasing use of lateral flow tests, which pick up fewer cases, by the community testing programme may play a role, and the fact ONS figures are published with more of a lag.",,,1613155959,{},gn36mgz,True,t3_lihub4,False,True,t3_lihub4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lihub4/r_number_falls_below_1_for_first_time_since_july/gn36mgz/,1613157720,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

So I see that there is an end to this, but that it's still far in my country.

[],,toontje18,,,[],,,,text,t2_meeqp,False,True,[],"&gt;Some of the AstraZeneca vaccines produced by the Leiden pharmaceutical company Halix will probably not stay in the EU, but will go to the United Kingdom.  That say sources involved in the production against the NOS.

&gt; This is a result of agreements Halix made last April when the company joined a consortium led by the University of Oxford, where the AstraZeneca vaccine was developed.  That partnership received a subsidy of millions from the British government.

&gt; How many vaccines Halix has produced so far and which part has remained in the EU is not clear.  The company does not respond to questions from the NOS.

&gt; AstraZeneca announced last month that it could deliver far fewer vaccines in the first quarter of this year than originally promised.  The EU expected 110 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, but it will only be about 40 million.

&gt; AstraZeneca CEO Soriot said in interviews that this was the result of setbacks in the European production chain.  Sending vaccines from the UK chain to the EU would be impossible.  ""The UK states that vaccines from the UK supply chain go to the UK first. That's how it works,"" said Soriot.

&gt; The CEO did not mean that the ""British production chain"" must be physically located in Great Britain, sources say.  The Dutch Halix became part of the British chain when it joined the consortium with the University of Oxford last year.

&gt; *Private investor*

&gt; At the time, the Leiden pharmaceutical company was still in talks with the Dutch government to obtain a subsidy for the large-scale production of vaccines.  The Ministry of VWS confirms this.  ""We have been doing everything we can to increase production since March, April last year,"" said a spokesman.  ""We bring people together and can possibly also finance. In this context we spoke with Halix and also with others.""

&gt; But Halix withdrew from those talks because a private investor turned up, sources involved in the talks say.  That private investment came from the United Kingdom.  Halix joined the Oxford consortium and would produce clinical research material.

&gt; UK grants

&gt; Part of that investment appears to be publicly funded with British government money.  A British WOB request shows that the consortium around the University of Oxford received some 33 million pounds, about 37.5 million euros, in British grants.  It is not clear how much Halix received from it.

&gt; There were conditions attached to those British subsidies, sources say.  Part of the Leiden production would be shipped to the UK if the Oxford vaccine were successful.  When AstraZeneca bought the Oxford vaccine, the pharmaceutical company also took over that obligation.

&gt; The fact that AstraZeneca can deliver much less to the EU than originally thought is mainly due to disappointing production at several locations.  Not only Europe would be a victim of this, but also in the UK less is delivered, according to British media.

&gt; *Refuse permit*

&gt; The question is whether vaccine deliveries from Halix and other European production locations to the UK can continue in the near future.  The European Union introduced an export mechanism two weeks ago, requiring manufacturers to obtain approval for all vaccines leaving the EU.  If Brussels decides that those exports are hindering the supply of vaccines to the EU, an export license can be refused.",,,1613155528,{},gn35m9v,True,t3_lihmjo,False,True,t3_lihmjo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lihmjo/share_vaccines_produced_in_the_netherlands_by_uk/gn35m9v/,1613157221,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

OVIEDO, Spain 
-

As new COVID-19 cases continued to drop on Thursday, some regional governments in Spain moved to ease restrictions, in defiance of the central government’s advice.

“It is fundamental for the regions to maintain restrictions […] and be careful with the UK variant. In Spain, we already have around 550 cases and many more suspicious cases,” Health Minister Carolina Darias told Spain’s Radio Nacional.
-

As of Wednesday, Spain had reported around 428 new cases per day per million people over the last week. That’s more than four times higher than Germany, which announced it was extending lockdown until March 7, and almost twice as high as in the UK, which remains closed.

Unlike those countries, Spain has not undergone a strict lockdown since spring of 2020. This wave of infections has come down thanks to a patchwork of local measures that include closing bars and non-essential shops, enforcing curfew as early as 10 p.m. local time (2100GMT) and limiting people from traveling in and out of cities.

But on Thursday, the government of Castile-La Mancha said it will reopen the hospitality sector and remove inter-regional travel restrictions, just as Extremadura will do from Friday. Officials also announced that bars and restaurants will reopen this weekend in the city of Malaga.

Meanwhile, the Madrid and Galician governments hinted that they would also begin to ease measures. 

This week, the Basque Country reopened bars and restaurants in the worst-hit areas after a court ruled there was no evidence that the establishments led to increased contagion.

&gt;After the ruling, the judge behind the decision, Luis Ángel Garrido, ruffled more feathers when he told press that epidemiologists “are regular family doctors who have taken a little course.”


On Thursday, Spain reported 17,583 more infections – more than 12,000 fewer than on the same day last week. Hospitalizations also continued their gradual decrease, but 41% of all the country’s intensive care units still remain occupied by COVID-19 patients.

Deaths, on the other hand, are still climbing. The Health Ministry confirmed another 513 fatalities, 81 more than last Thursday.

So far, Spain has administered 2.3 million vaccine doses – 80% of all vaccines received – with nearly 950,000 people having received both doses.

I can think of some white people that certainly aren't getting the vaccine, why on Earth would I feel that their race makes them somehow qualified to educate a person who isn't white? That's absurd and infuriating, and even if it's not outright said the racial superiority aspect is very, very blatant in this article.

The way we talk about race in this country is so unbelievably frustrating to me, and it bothers me that I very often see it perpetrated by people who think they're being helpful in improving race relations. Both sides of my family have been in this country for a few generations, and when they came here, yeah they were pretty despised. They were told they ""need not apply"" on one side, and the best work the other side could get was getting a few dollars a week in a shoe factory. We were considered less than the people that were in charge of the country because of where we came from and the language we spoke. And I can't help but pick up the same energy from articles like this, no matter how much they might emphasize that they love minorities and immigrants.

Writers of this kind of article think that white Americans are different from minorities and immigrants. That we should be responsible when something is happening with them.

The State Ombudsman found it to be a violation of human rights, and I'm pretty sure that outstrips unsourced claims from anonymous redditors.

&gt;It affected a small portion of society which unfortunately was also one of our most vulnerable groups. Stopping the outbreak in those towers was critical not just for the health and safety of the city, but for the elderly and vulnerable groups that had a higher concentration within those places.

And yet there's still a chance the virus could have escaped and threatened the ""health and safety of the city"" - that's actually exactly what later happened at one of the quarantine hotels set up later on. So if you continue following that logic you're subscribing to, you may not like where you end up.

&gt;These are the hard decisions that had to be made. You can complain about the optics all you like, but it was a successful manoeuvre that saved lives and cut time off what was already a shockingly long lockdown.

So successful that Victoria gets to do it *all over again*!

&gt;The tower lockdowns were actually completed efficiently and effectively in time, and the fact that people are trying to compare it to human rights abuses, or “welding of doors shut” is an insult to actual marginalised groups that suffer at the yoke of real authoritarian governments.

&gt;In Brazil, several similar cases were documented with a new variant there. Researchers are exploring whether reinfections help explain a recent surge in the city of Manaus, where three-fourths of residents were thought to have been previously infected.

&gt;Doctors in South Africa began to worry when they saw a surge of cases late last year in areas where blood tests suggested many people had already had the virus.

 &gt;Scientists discovered a new version of the virus that’s more contagious and less susceptible to certain treatments. It now causes more than 90 percent of new cases in South Africa and has spread to 40 countries including the United States.

&gt;Madhi led a study testing Novavax’s vaccine and found it less effective against the new variant. The study also revealed that infections with the new variant were just as common among people who had COVID-19 as those who had not.

    - Kids themselves will break this rule constantly
    - The majority of classrooms are too small to space kids. They'd be lucky to get them 3 ft apart and fit all the desks in most schools.
    - Not sure if you've seen a normal school hallway during any sort of room change, but it is wall to wall flesh. Most schools operate well above designed capacity and the designed capacity certainly didn't account for social distancing
2. Ventilation
    - Most schools have several windowless interior rooms
    - Most school HVAC systems are antiquated and do not meet covid requirements for how air is moved (return air from one room becomes register air for others without adequate filtration)
    - Some schools use boiler heat for radiators instead of forced air, providing no ventilation at all (some of these in low-income districts in cooler climates don't even have AC).
3. Masking
    - Kids get their belief system from their parents and from polling we know at least 5% of American adults refuse to wear a mask (the polling numbers are actually 8%) while about 25% would go without a mask if the weren't required to wear one (this is inclusive of the refusers). There are going to be a lot of angsty anti-maskers.
    - Kids are angsty and even ones that believe in masks will probably rebel against them at some point (YOLO).
    - Kids are kinda dumb, so improper mask use or just improper masks will also be a factor.


&gt; I like how all of a sudden there is a mistrust of the cdc intentions when it goes against the narrative

Sudden? You ask any SE Asian if masks are effective against SARS or MERS or any other coronavirus BEFORE Covid and they would look at you like you're the dumbest motherfucker they ever met. After covid they'd probably be telling you off for even questioning mask wearing. Of course masks are effective, we didn't need to research that or prove it, it was a concrete fact on day 1 of the pandemic. The second a health care official told people they didn't need to wear masks, they lost all credibility to me. They're either stupid or willing to lie to the public to fulfill an objective. 

The only reason to say such a thing would be to stop panic buying so they could supply health care workers with masks and the appropriate way to accomplish that is to use the power of the government to appropriate the supplies rather than to lie to people about it. 

I want them to tell me to my face that they are opening schools to provide child care so people can get back to work because they think fewer kids will die from covid than the coming economic downturn they are hoping to avoid by opening schools. I think they're wrong, I think the long term health effects of childhood covid infection will be worse than the effects of keeping schools closed until kids are vaccinated. I think waiting to vaccinate kids until the studies are done is worse than just putting them in wave 1d or whatever the next number is (because they can't bear to tell someone they're not in wave 1) and preventing more cases of covid vs the infinitesimally small risk that the vaccines are somehow safe for 16 year olds and deadly for 6 year olds.",,,1613168749,{},gn3yaoz,False,t3_lijklo,False,False,t1_gn3umii,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lijklo/cdc_recommends_us_schools_reopen_with_universal/gn3yaoz/,1613171479,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You are being purposefully deceptive. 

Both vaccine manufacturers updated their vaccine schedule deliveries for Q2 and there are still big blank empty weeks for Q1?

Could Pfizer and Moderna feasibly deliver 2.7 million doses in the last two weeks of March?  I'm about 98% confident they could stop deliveries to the US and meet that commitment.  

Even if they met that commitment, where would Canada put them!  We'd have 300,000 vials of the vaccine over our refrigeration capacity.   We'd have to innoculate 502,000 Canadians every day that week for nothing to go to waste.

[],,GalileoGurdjieff,,,[],,,,text,t2_9ayyzh09,False,False,[],"Korean pharmaceutical and biotech companies are rushing to develop a Covid-19 treatment using natural ingredients.

They are aggressively conducting trials, particularly in India, because the country has many Covid-19 cases and high unmet clinical needs.

Last year, India eased drug regulations on the nation’s traditional medicine Ayurveda to promote Covid-19 treatment development. The deregulation has raised a chance to win approval for natural ingredient-based drugs.

Video game developer Dragonfly and biotech venture APRG agreed to collaborate on developing a Covid-19 treatment based on APRG64, an extract from Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb and Rhus chinensis Mil fruit. Dragonfly’s largest shareholder is Syswork, a subsidiary of diagnostic kit maker BBB.

APRG will lead clinical trials and R&amp;D, while Dragonfly will raise funds for the new drug development and commercialize the medicine.

In October, APRG won the nod from India’s Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) to conduct a phase-1 study of APRG64. The two companies plan to complete the phase-1 trial in April and conduct phase-2 and phase-3 trials simultaneously in May.

APRG got APRG64 technology transfer from Kyunghee University’s Biomedical Research Institute (BMRI) in August and formed a consortium with Genencell, the Korea Medicine Research Institute, and Korea Pharma for the new drug development.

Korea Pharma will produce clinical samples of APRG64, Genencell will lead the phase-1 study, and APRG will lead the phase-2 and phase-3 trials.

Separate from the consortium, Genencell is working on another Covid-19 treatment using natural substances.

After licensing-in a shingles treatment candidate ES16001 from BMRI in 2017, Genencell tests it in a clinical study to develop it as a Covid-19 drug. Genencell completed the phase-2 research on the candidate treatment and is preparing for a global phase-3 trial. The company plans to seek India’s approval for an Ayurveda drug. Korea Pharma will manufacture clinical samples.

Helixmith is also planning to conduct a clinical trial in traditional medicine in India to develop TADIOS, a respiratory disease treatment candidate, as a Covid-19 drug with ingredients derived from natural substances.

Helixmith will evaluate whether TADIOS can be used as adjuvant therapy in 100 patients with mild to severe Covid-19 infection.

The clinical trial will be conducted following the Ministry of AYUSH regulations, India's traditional medicine regulatory body, the company said.

In April, India relaxed regulations on traditional medicine licenses and permitted clinical trials of natural ingredient-derived drugs for Covid-19 treatment. Depending on the results of a single clinical study, it is possible to obtain functional food approval.

Helixmith has completed the submission of documents to the “Ethics Committee (EC),” a clinical trial review committee of India. If the company passes the EC review, it can start the clinical trial immediately.

If the company gets positive data from the trial, it will explore the possibility of winning the license as a traditional medicine in India and neighboring countries, it said.",,,1613087893,{},gn01sv6,True,t3_lhyj96,False,True,t3_lhyj96,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lhyj96/korean_drugmakers_race_to_develop_natural/gn01sv6/,1613095559,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

EcoHealth Alliance President Dr. Peter Daszak has with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). According to The Wall Street Journal, Dr. Daszak has worked closely with a leading virologist at WIV, Dr. Shi Zhengli on the study of bat viruses, which from 2014, was in part funded by US government grants. The institute is located just a few miles away from the wet market where Chinese authorities say SARS-CoV-2 first emerged.

Here he is joking about how he's going to Wuhan to drink baijiu (Chinese firewater) with Shi Zhengli - the researcher that works at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

Here he is quashing the lab leak theory to help his friends.

At this point with almost no one vaccinated, anyone who ignores masks and other public health measures endangers others because they can spread disease to innocent people and put a strain on health care system since even those needing hospital care for non-Covid related serious diseases are suffering.

After the Covid vaccine becomes widely available, it then becomes more of it's on them to be that stupid since those who are vaccinated are protected from other's stupidity.

I realize that there are issues of herd immunity and people who can't be vaccinated for health reasons but by and large, those who are vaccinated are protected and seem - at the very worst - to not get the worst cases.

It is somewhat like what is going on now as to a great extent people who are very careful about following public health guidelines seem to not be contracting Covid in the same high percentages as those who go around maskless. Compare Biden campaign versus ex-President's campaign in terms of numbers of aides and staffers who contracted Covid as one campaign was careful and the other careless as a matter of POLICY FFS. 

Again I am over-simplifying since there are people who contract COVID because they are in such extreme conditions that even masking can't help and it is impossible to social distance.

I get brain fog / confusion, chest pain, difficulty breathing / chest tightness, chills, muscle and joint pain, nausea, headaches. All these symptoms come and go and are exacerbated my activity, even activity like walking up and down stairs. Some days I feel pretty normal now, but it never lasts terribly long. I initially lost all my smell and most of my taste, probably have recovered 25% of my smell, 80% of my taste. My chest will get tender too, where my shirt or blanket will feel heavy and painful. I feel like my heart beats weirdly sometimes too, but I have no way of measuring my heart or O2 levels. My lungs appear to be fine after an X-ray, so that’s good at least. I’ve been taking Alvesco, a steroid inhaler, to help with my breathing, as well as Vitamin D, Zinc, and a multivitamin. I think the Alvesco really helps. The brain fog can make it really difficult to read and focus and I basically just have to lay down and wait it out. Even sitting up for an extended period of time can be quite taxing.

One reason we don't have vaccines approved for the SARS and MERS coronaviruses is that researchers were struggling to create vaccines that didn't create a potentially deadly inflammatory response similar to the one generated by the live viruses themselves, so for one... that. To be clear, this obviously was a solvable problem, it just needed more research devoted to it, which is why we have safe COVID vaccines now, but it required experimenting with different doses and then running actual human trials to make sure it was safe.

Also, I don't know why you think mRNA vaccines were a super established technology before this. These are literally the first approved vaccines using mRNA tech. The only reason we even know they work is that we bothered testing them instead of haphazardly injecting them into people at random doses and praying.

&gt;What do we do about the inevitable mutations? Let them run wild while we test for 11 months again?

No, much like with flu vaccines, we should be able to do shorter trials with faster approvals now that we have a baseline understanding of their safety and effectiveness.

Yeah, so the vaccines reduce infections, and symptoms upon infection, even variants. We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread. We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with milder symptoms spread slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well.

If young people get exposed and develop immunity via clearing an infection, each variant they are exposed to will just broaden their immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). So they'll have good and broad immunity to a variety of variants, which seems likely to me to be an indication that they won't catch or spread the virus. Same thing happens when someone who is vaccinated is exposed to a new variant. Their immunity is broadened and strengthened by each subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. But remember, so many people will be less likely to spread the virus, so it's pretty unlikely that this reduced level of spread will be sufficient to sustain the virus in the way we have seen over the past year. So if a variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. If they don't become widespread, Yay!

One Saturday night last June, it got up to 95°F outside (approaching 8pm or so), and my apartment’s A/C unit’s capacitor domed while I was out running errands (I didn’t know this at the time). The temperature started rising, and when I got back, my thermostat was reading 88°F!!

So, I called my landlord, told her the problem, and she said, “Okay, I’m going to get in touch with maintenance, let me call you back.”

3 minutes later…

“Yes, hi, Jared {one of the maintenance guys} will be over in the next-half hour.”

…and a half-hour later, Jared was up on my roof, taking a look at my A/C unit, and it took him 30 seconds to figure out what was wrong (RE: A/C unit capacitor had domed). He was able to fix it immediately, and cool air started blowing in my apartment again.

Impeccable service. He came ASAP over to address the issue, and he fixed it in no time. And I didn’t have to pay a dime. Well, I actually ended up giving the guy a $10-bill (that was all the cash I had) and a loaf of banana bread for his troubles (it was 8pm on a Saturday night!), but he even said, “Honestly, I’m getting paid double since it’s past 5pm, but I do appreciate it!” And then he was off to enjoy the rest of his Saturday night.

The absolute biggest benefit of renting: if something breaks, I call, and it gets fixed ASAP, and at no charge.

This is kind of wrong. You *might* be able to argue Canada made this bet, but if so, we made it years ago.

You’ll get upvoted for propagating fear on here, downvoted for suggesting viable solutions and god forbid you display any pessimism or skepticism in light of stuff like “wear two masks”. 

Time to wake up people. This is endemic. The unfortunate loss of life early in the pandemic were unacceptable, it’s time to do something about it, and that is read up on how pandemics / epidemics work. Wear a mask, wear two or five. Live and let live. If you lost someone to covid19, you can direct the blame into those who have profited massively off of all this. 85-90% of the wealth and assets in this Nation are in the hands of a small: 200,000 people. This wasn’t coordinated attack by any entity, this was a sloppy chaotic middle-school lunch room fight by politicians and public health officials. People died and our privatized healthcare system made a fortune off it. Mismanagement and underprepared all around.

""Vaccinated people become far less of a COVID transmission risk even before receiving their second dose, a new “game-changing” Israeli study has concluded.

The first mass research of its kind on patients who test positive for the coronavirus and are confirmed to have been at least partially vaccinated, the study found that such patients have far smaller viral loads than those who haven’t received the vaccine.

“Our results show that infections occurring 12 days or longer following vaccination have significantly reduced viral loads,” wrote a multi-institution research team that crunched data from the Maccabi healthcare provider, stating they believe that could be important in “potentially affecting viral shedding and contagiousness as well as severity of the disease.”

The viral load was shown to be reduced fourfold on average for infections occurring 12 to 28 days after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.""

So I'm definitely not one of those that wants to push it onto everybody.

Where I do think 2020 taught me a lesson is that maybe we should adopt what asian cultures do. When somebody gets sick they put on a mask when going out. That is something people in Japan, Hong Kong etc have done before covid. Which I kinda wish we did here.

Look at it this way. 100 vaccines are sent to a location on sunday. On sunday they administer 100 vaccines. They then close since they no longer have vaccines. 100 people have received a dose on sunday. 

Or 

100 vaccines are sent to a location on Sunday. On Sunday they administer 14 doses and then stop so they can ""vaccinate each day"". Monday they administer 14 doses and again stop. This repeats each day of the week so that all 100 does are spread out. 
14 people have received a dose on Sunday. The remaining 86 people are at risk of exposure for at least one additional day than they had to be, some will be at risk for an additional 6 days longer than they needed to be.

## Public health recommendations for vaccinated persons

While mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have demonstrated high efficacy at preventing severe and symptomatic COVID-19, there is currently limited information on how much the vaccines might reduce transmission and how long protection lasts. In addition, the efficacy of the vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants is not known. At this time, vaccinated persons should continue to follow [**current guidance**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) to protect themselves and others, including wearing a mask, staying at least 6 feet away from others, avoiding crowds, avoiding poorly ventilated spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands often, following [CDC travel guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html), and following any applicable workplace or school guidance, including guidance related to personal protective equipment use or SARS-CoV-2 testing.

**However, vaccinated persons with an exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are not required to** [**quarantine**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html) **if they meet all of the following criteria**†**:**

* Are fully vaccinated (i.e., ≥2 weeks following receipt of the second dose in a 2-dose series, or ≥2 weeks following receipt of one dose of a single-dose vaccine)
* Are within 3 months following receipt of the last dose in the series
* Have remained asymptomatic since the current COVID-19 exposure

Persons who do not meet all 3 of the above criteria should continue to follow current [quarantine guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html) after exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

Although the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from vaccinated persons to others is still uncertain, vaccination has been demonstrated to prevent symptomatic COVID-19; symptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission is thought to have a greater role in transmission than purely asymptomatic transmission. Additionally, individual and societal benefits of avoiding unnecessary quarantine may outweigh the potential but unknown risk of transmission, and facilitate the direction of public health resources to persons at highest risk for transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to others. This recommendation to waive quarantine for people with vaccine-derived immunity aligns with [quarantine recommendations for those with natural immunity](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/duration-isolation.html), which eases implementation.

Fully vaccinated persons who do not quarantine should still watch for [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) for 14 days following an exposure. If they experience symptoms, they should be clinically evaluated for COVID-19, including SARS-CoV-2 testing, if indicated. In addition, vaccinated persons should continue to follow [**current guidance**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) to protect themselves and others, including all other [SARS-CoV-2 testing recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html) and requirements, and [state, territorial, tribal, and local](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html) travel recommendations or requirements. For additional considerations regarding quarantine or work restrictions for fully vaccinated healthcare personnel, patients, or residents in healthcare settings, please see section below.

These quarantine recommendations for vaccinated persons, including the criteria for timing since receipt of the last dose in the vaccination series, will be updated when more data become available and additional COVID-19 vaccines are authorized.

† CDC has not systematically evaluated the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines from manufacturers that have not sought an EUA in the United States. For the purposes of these quarantine criteria, considerations for accepting a vaccination series that is not FDA-authorized include whether the vaccine product has received emergency approval from the World Health Organization or authorization from a national regulatory agency.

**Vaccinated healthcare personnel, patients, and residents in healthcare settings**

These criteria could also be applied when considering work restrictions for fully vaccinated healthcare personnel with [higher-risk exposures](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-hcp.html), as a strategy to alleviate staffing shortages. Of note, exposed healthcare personnel would not be required to quarantine outside of work.

As an exception to the above guidance no longer requiring quarantine for fully vaccinated persons, **vaccinated inpatients and residents in healthcare settings should continue to** [**quarantine**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html) **following an exposure** to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19; outpatients should be cared for using appropriate [Transmission-Based Precautions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html). This exception is due to the unknown vaccine effectiveness in this population, the higher risk of severe disease and death, and challenges with social distancing in healthcare settings. Although not preferred, healthcare facilities could consider waiving quarantine for vaccinated patients and residents as a strategy to mitigate critical issues (e.g., lack of space, staff, or PPE to safely care for exposed patients or residents) when other options are unsuccessful or unavailable. These decisions could be made in consultation with public health officials and infection control experts.

CDC’s [healthcare infection control guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control.html) contains additional considerations regarding the need to protect healthcare personnel, patients, and residents while also alleviating any staffing shortages.",,,1613084520,{},gmzuxb6,False,t3_lhrlwe,False,True,t3_lhrlwe,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lhrlwe/recently_vaccinated_people_need_not_quarantine/gmzuxb6/,1613092278,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In a few months we will get the same BioNTech vaccine from Novartis, Sanofi, Merck and so on... **But Pfizer is absolutely the best big pharma of the world**. Without Pfizer production of two billions doses in 2021 would not possible.

- Sputnik can be good vaccine and can be  terrible one. Trial phase III was a mess and took place only in Moscow(still no protocol available). We just have not enough data and data we have has not so good quality. Additional problem: we do not get Sputnik in any case soon, because domestic production is quite limited. 

- Novavax is wonder fool, yes. Agree in 100%.

I can also tell you that our nations abilities have been dismantled for over the last 50 years.

In Alberta, NDP was elected. They had 4 years to start a program which  was going to help out a lot of Canadians.

What happened? She releases the program while she has 6-8 months in office. Was she holding it as a card for re-election? This was a promise that got her elected. Or, did she know that because she was on her way out, by adding the program people would not be able to benefit for very long as the next administration would shut it down?

You have to understand what happens in politics. They get you excited about all these programs that the government is going to provide to the people...

So, New Zealand, Australia, Taiwan, Vietnam, South Korea, Sri Lanka, and many more can achieve that but we Westerners are too dumb for this?

There are always some excuses and explanations but none of them hold water.

Some say it is because of the winter. But in New Zealand was Winter between April and September, it is on the Southern Hemisphere. And South Korea has pretty cold Winters, much like Canada. Plus, Brazil, Spain, Iran and Florida are hot, and this did not make much difference.

Some say it is because of the political culture and in Western liberal countries this is not possible.  But Australia, New Zealand and Taiwan are liberal democracies. Perhaps more democratic even than the US.

Some say these are rural societies. But Bangkok, Seoul, Melbourne, Sidney, Taipe are megapolis, as large as the largest European cities, and the chinese cities of Chongqing, Shanghai and Beijing each have between 19 and 29 millions inhabitants. New York city is the largest city of the US and it has only 8 million inhabitants, about the same as the city of Bangkok.

Some say it is because some if these places are islands or peninsulas. But Great Britan is an Island. Ireland is an Island. Spain and Italy are Peninsulas. While Vietnam and South Korea are not. And also, very few people get to Australia, New Zealand by swimming through the sea, but in the same manner very few people from abroad reach European or US cities by anything different than plane.


Some say that people in Asia are just different. No they are not. They are humans like us. 

Let's get serious: **What** *all* these countries did was nothing else than strict and consequent measures, starting from consequent 14-day quarantine for people arriving, to serious and successful contact tracing, to effective lock-downs when necessary, where everyone, including sex workers, were paid if necessary, to stay home. And this was communicated unambiguously and clear.  And this worked.

Also today we learned that Canada was originally expecting 8M doses of Pfizer and we know that going from 5 to 6 doses per vial only raises it by 20% so just with that we would expect there to be 9.6M doses.  So it is good to know that Pfizer is confident in their production and is giving Canada more doses.

Justin Trudeau said today that he talked to the CEO from Pfizer and he confirmed that we will get 4M doses by the end of March.  That is really encouraging and reassuring.  I am now very confident that we will get those doses.

Probably  the biggest difference was for those people who decided to remove their  elderly loved ones from nursing homes. It's very possible that doing so saved their life.

And then there's a lot of people making small personal decisions. I'm Chinese-American and saw a lot of elderly Chinese people begin to mask  in public long before the shutdowns, and definitely before mask  mandates. Statistically, at least a few of those old people saved their own lives or prevented a hospital trip. (Or at least catching the flu in  a bad flu year.)

Then there's those people who were smart enough to voluntarily cancel their  January/February cruise trips, avoiding at the very least a quarantine  hell at sea.

If you had the forethought to sign up for grocery delivery or meal kit delivery boxes  early, once March came around, it was nearly impossible to sign up.

At the time I wasn't panicked, but the advisories about socially distancing in articles pre-shutdown were scary enough that I made minor voluntary  changes, like deciding to hike on weekends rather than taking the subway  to indoor cultural events in the city.

A number of unaddressed questions. I am just going to look at vitamin C vs standard of care because I don't know what zinc might be doing.

1) Table 1 shows ~2x as many standard of care patients were taking antipyretics, NSAIDS, and bronchodilators vs in the vitamin C group. Shouldn't these treatments affect the symptom score based on fever, cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue?

2) The original plan was supposed to be able to detect a difference of one day in time to 50% symptom reduction, but they stopped the study early with only ~40% the expected number of patients. Table 2 shows standard of care took 6.7 days on average vs 5.5 days for ascorbic acid. So the results would have been consistent with a benefit due to vitamin c on their primary endpoint if they had the expected number of subjects. Basically there was only ""no benefit""  due to the small sample size.

3) Figure 3 does show an apparent benefit of vitamin C by the time the treatment was stopped (10 days). Only 5/48 (10%) patients had not reached the primary endpoint vs 14/50 (28%) in standard of care. I don't know why you would stop giving the treatment even if the patient still had symptoms. So that seems to be the correct timepoint to compare.

4) Baseline 4-component score was only 4.0 for all the groups. This represents very mild symptoms to begin with, I wonder if many even had a vitamin deficiency.

Basically, vitamin C was looking promising but they ended the study with small sample size and misinterpret lack of statistical significance as no benefit. They also ignore the much higher percentage of people taking drugs meant to reduce the symptoms in the standard of care group.",,,1613154492,{},gn338lx,False,t3_liffnb,False,True,t1_gn2s89e,/r/Coronavirus/comments/liffnb/vitamin_c_zinc_dont_lessen_covid19_symptoms_study/gn338lx/,1613156021,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

A doctor I follow on various social media said it's very likely it does reduce transmission, we just need more data before scientists say for sure.

So I do believe some relief is coming. We just need to give it a bit longer...even if that feels really difficult given how long we have been at this thing.

I think you can also make some personal choices. My father-in-law has late stage lung cancer and lives on the other side of the country from my husband and I. We flew out to see him in August but flying durinn COVID was not fun. Now that we will be vaccinated, we are planning to try and get my husband out there again (so long as he would actually be able to see him).

So right at the top you have ""On Feb. 29, the U.S. surgeon general Dr. Jerome Adams [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Surgeon_General/status/1233725785283932160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1233725785283932160&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inquirer.com%2Fhealth%2Fcoronavirus%2Fface-masks-hand-washing-coronavirus-protection-20200304.html) that masks do not offer any benefit to the average citizen.""

So  here is a start of a timeline for masks in the US. Its clear they knew  masks were effective in February for preventing the spread in doctors,  but it wouldn't be until April 3rd the CDC would start telling us to put  shirts over our face.

By  comparison from the same article "" Meanwhile, some health agencies have  taken a stand that calls for  mask-wearing in public from the early  stages of the outbreak — Hong Kong  on [Jan. 24](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202001/24/P2020012400762.htm), mainland China on [Jan. 31](http://www.nhc.gov.cn/jkj/s7916/202001/a3a261dabfcf4c3fa365d4eb07ddab34.shtml). "" I  \[wonder\][https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/study-reports-first-case-of-coronavirus-spread-by-asymptomatic-person/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/study-reports-first-case-of-coronavirus-spread-by-asymptomatic-person/)  what else happened on January 31st.......

Going  forward 9 days from that tweet we have  \[this CNN Interview by Fauci  telling the public not to wear masks unless sick and specifically  talking about shortages\] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRa6t\_e7dgI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRa6t_e7dgI)

Mind  you this interview was given right when New York was infecting its  self, Deaths would start spiking around March 27ish Peaking on April  14th. Now lets factor in the mean time of death from infection being  what 18 days? He gave this interview telling people mask's did not help  unless you were sick days before New York started its rampant  uncontrolled spread. This already being more then a month after the  Source of the outbreak, China ordered masks for the general public in  the above timeline because of proven asymptomatic spread with multiple  other countries following.

So lets go deeper  \[Here is a wired article from Feb 4th\][https://www.wired.com/story/amid-coronavirus-fears-a-mask-shortage-could-spread-globally/](https://www.wired.com/story/amid-coronavirus-fears-a-mask-shortage-could-spread-globally/) This is nearly a month before the tweet from Dr. Adams telling people  in all capitals letters not to buy masks. I will just grab this quote  though to prove a point. "" China Global Television Network, with  factories churning out 20 million masks a day "" China knew masks worked  and went into over drive production of them.

I wonder what was happening in the US during that same time.  \[March 18th\][https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2020-03-18/us-nursing-homes-warn-of-looming-shortage-of-masks-and-gowns](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2020-03-18/us-nursing-homes-warn-of-looming-shortage-of-masks-and-gowns)  \[March 23rd\][https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/cuomo-governors-beg-medical-supplies-trump-refuses.html](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/cuomo-governors-beg-medical-supplies-trump-refuses.html)   \[March 24th\][https://www.epi.org/blog/nurses-in-garbage-bags-why-the-trump-administration-must-use-the-defense-production-act-to-mobilize-production-of-critically-needed-hospital-protective-equipment-immediately/](https://www.epi.org/blog/nurses-in-garbage-bags-why-the-trump-administration-must-use-the-defense-production-act-to-mobilize-production-of-critically-needed-hospital-protective-equipment-immediately/)

Maybe this is a \[Reason\][https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/defense-production-act-coronavirus-trump-respirators-masks-ventilators.html](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/defense-production-act-coronavirus-trump-respirators-masks-ventilators.html)

So  lets pretend that they didn't know until April that masks helped. Even  after that Trump never invoked the defense act to force the production  of N95s, he only properly invoked it for Ventilators.   \[Here is an  article from September still talking about mask shortages\][https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/supply-chain/6-reasons-n95-masks-remain-in-shortage-across-the-us.html](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/supply-chain/6-reasons-n95-masks-remain-in-shortage-across-the-us.html)  You mean random companies in January wanted to produce and sell the US  masks and we said no? Why would random companies in January and February  be expecting an increase in mask use? Could it be because the source of  the outbreak already knew to wear masks and was telling people to do  so?

This is also ignoring the fact that in the interviewI already linked from July  "" ""I don't regret anything I said then because in the context of the  time  in which I said it, it was correct. We were told in our task force   meetings that we have a serious problem with the lack of PPEs and  masks  for the health providers who are putting themselves in harm's way  every  day to take care of sick people,"" [Fauci told O'Donnell. ](https://www.instyle.com/news/dr-fauci-says-with-all-due-modesty-i-think-im-pretty-effective) ""

""we  knew masks worked on march 8th when I told the public not to wear masks  unless sick but did everything we could to prevent the general public  from knowing this because we did nothing to prepare for this"" That is  what his statement says when you factor in the timeline of everything  else.

As much as we'd like to, we can't completely optimize who gets it first. Let's remember who was president when the vaccines were first being distributed - there was no support from federal government, leaving states to figure it out on their own, and half the state governments spending more energy on denying the issue rather than making plans to distribute the vaccine. Health departments across the country were legitimately surprised to receive vaccines when they did and had to rush communication that they were available.

The United Nations (UN) human rights body has released a statement saying it's Israel's responsibility to provide equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.

The body says differential access is ""morally and legally"" unacceptable under international law laid out in the Geneva Conventions on the regulation of occupied territories.

But Israeli health minister, Yuli Edelstein, told the BBC: ""We can also look into the so-called Oslo agreements where it says loud and clear that the Palestinians have to take care of their own health.""

""Working with the EMA in the approval process is a critical step in providing potential access to our vaccine for the many people who need protection from this deadly disease.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The agency evaluates the data using what is known as a rolling review process. In this process, data and results are reviewed on an ongoing basis, even if the test series has not yet been completed and no application for approval in the EU has been filed either.

I noted that exactly none of them said that. 

WP, in fact, says pretty much the opposite:

&gt; “We just do not have the technical capabilities for that,” said Ali Abd Rabbo, director of the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza. “We have held sessions with the Israeli side in this regard, but until this moment there is no agreement.”

WSJ mentions that Palestine didn't ask Israel for vaccines because they lack the infrastructure to store them. Giving Palestine vaccines is different from vaccinating Palestinians.

And Time has the PA publicly saying that they *do* want Israeli help:

&gt; Israel has a “duty” to vaccinate Palestinians, the Palestinian Authority said in a statement it released on Jan 10. Not doing so constitutes “racial discrimination against the Palestinian people and a denial of their right to healthcare.”

Business Insider, I'm assuming the article you were talking about is ""Israel, the Palestinians, and the COVID-19 vaccination rollout: The legal and moral obligations"" mentions another article you might really be interested in:

[],,OhioanRunner,,,[],,,,text,t2_pamb5,False,False,[],"R is the number of new cases, on average, every case causes. R(t) is this number at any given time, while R0 is the R number if no one is immune and no one makes any effort to avoid the virus. 

R0 for Covid is somewhere between 2 and 4, which means that every case, initially, will cause 2-4 more cases. Say we go with 3. Because every cases causes another 3 cases, in the first round, the index patient causes 3 cases. for the purposes of this example, we will say it takes their entire 10-day infectious period to cause those 3 cases, and none of those cases can themselves transmit until the next period.

So now it’s day 11, and 3 people have it, having gotten it directly from the index patient. The index patient is recovered, but your population consists of millions so his immunity doesn’t matter modeling the near future. Those 3 current cases, over the next 10 days, will each create another 3 cases. On day 21, you will have 9 current cases, and 4 recovered (the three that just recovered plus the index patient). Between days 21 and 30, those 9 will cause 27 new cases, 3 each, and then themselves recover. 13 will be recovered by day 31, but 27 remain infected. A total case history of 40 now.

So we can see that for every time the disease’s course passes in this simplified model, the virus spreads by a factor of 3. That means we can model the spread with the equation C(t) = 3^t where t is the number of 10-day periods which have passed since the index patient became infected. So that’s R0

But hold on. The virus can’t spread at a rate of  3^t forever. People who’ve previously had the virus mostly become immune, and once enough people have had it that others around them start noticing something is going around, they’re going to start avoiding it. That means hand-washing, masks, maybe staying at home, and since all of those things are deviations from normal behavior, those being R(t), the present value, down. If through a mix of people being immune (and thus failing to contract the virus when they otherwise would have been 1 of the 3) and people avoiding (and thus lowering the number of people the infected person exposes to the virus in the first place), the R(t) value falls below 1, all of a sudden that means every case is creating less than 1 new case. What does that look like? Well let’s imagine that at the end of the previous example, a major lockdown was instituted (since so few people are immune, this will likely be the only way to get R(t) below 1). This lockdown pushes R(t) to 2/3 of 1, or 0.67. Now, you can’t have 2/3 of a case, so what that really means in essence is 2 out of every 3 cases will go on to create a new case, while the others will fail to do so. So on day 41, those 27 cases have only caused 18 more and recovered themselves. By day 51, the 18 current cases only cause 12. By day 61, 8. And so on and so forth, the virus decaying away. 

Eventually, the government is able to identify the last few people who carry the virus and quarantine them for longer than the virus takes to recover from, and R(t) drops to 0. When the quarantined individuals all recover, the virus is said to be *eliminated*, meaning no one in the region has it. When the virus is *eliminated* everywhere in the world, it is said to be *eradicated*. That’s the final goal in the long term. Drive down cases so low that individual cases can reliably be found and quarantined, denying them the opportunity to spread the virus, resulting eventually in eradication.",,,1613166099,{},gn3sqba,False,t3_lihub4,False,True,t1_gn3bncm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lihub4/r_number_falls_below_1_for_first_time_since_july/gn3sqba/,1613168737,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;**EMA wants to assess modified vaccines against new variants more quickly**  
&gt;  
&gt;The European Medicines Agency EMA plans to accelerate the evaluation of vaccines that are adapted to protect against new variants. So says the head of the covid task force of the EMA against the Reuters news agency.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The chairman of the vaccine review team says there is no need for pharmaceutical companies to test the modified vaccines on a long-term basis and on a large scale, as is done in the development of the original vaccine. As far as he is concerned, modifications to vaccines can be tested on small groups.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""We are in the process of drafting new guidelines, assuming no major phase three studies are needed. This will allow us to work faster,"" the EMA chief told Reuters. He says he wants to test with a few hundred participants instead of 30,000 to 40,000.

He's a massive hypocrite, ordering the Florida Highway Patrol to set up checkpoints on state border crossings to enforce travel bans yet this week has been whining about the possibility of the federal government instituting its own travel bans.

As a second hypocrite example, he told Hillsborough Schools (one of the largest school districts in the country) that they could make their decision about opening, then when they adjusted their calendar slightly after consulting with him his office reneged and fought with them.

His police also raided the house of Rebekah Jones, a whistleblower on covid issues, pointing guns at her and her children when she was clearly no threat at all, even if she did commit the crime she is alleged of committing with almost no evidence as yet: sending a message to other professionals using a system that literally everyone in the world had access to, because the incompetent government shared a single username and password with every employee as well as published on the public website.

He refused to comply with valid requests for information filed by prominent Florida news agencies investigating the covid pandemic. 

I'd love to be able to say that our governor is doing a decent job. Many of our metrics are decent, but the fact that Ron DeSantis is repeatedly lying and harassing people to obfuscate the data makes me doubt his performance. If none of those things had happened then I might have thought he was doing surprisingly well even though I didn't vote for him. Note that none of those are related to his covid performance at all or have any basis in policy. They're all self-imposed damage that benefited nobody and yet he did them.

There are plenty of places where I think he should have been able to do better, and we have seen countless stories of terrible situations like seniors waiting in cars for hours to go home without a vaccine, websites crashing, multiple websites all separately offering the vaccine differently, the state offering a new combined website that multiple counties don't even use. He could change the policy on who should distribute vaccines, giving it to the Florida National Guard for example instead of to Publix (curious about corruption there as well, but it is a defendable policy choice).

You are correct that the math doesn't add up.

Funny how nobody is questioning the  math of that news release, or the title of the article which is just  about the best spin I'd expect from the CBC for what is terrible news.

Prime  Minister Justin Trudeau is concealing - yet again - the nefarious truth  of manufacturer's vaccine delivery reduction or cancellation as it  applies to CanSino, Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson.

Nobody  seems to want to remember last week, that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau  was still promising a target of six million doses delivered by the end  of March.

Pfizer was originally  going to deliver a total of four million doses in the first quarter,   while Moderna was set to deliver 2 million doses - delivery targets  being promised by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

As of this week, Canada has received 1.4 million doses of both the Moderna and Pfizer products (short 3.6 million doses).

Pfizer  has committed over the next two weeks to delivery of 878,000  more Pfizer shots, then 888,000 more before March 15th. Meanwhile,  Moderna has only committed to shipping 168,000 doses of  their vaccine over the next two weeks.

All  told, we expect delivery of 3,334,000 shots by March 15. That means the  two manufacturers will be short 2,666,000 doses combined from what  Trudeau promised.

STUDY: ONE PARTICULAR VACCINE PROTECTS AGAINST DEADLY NEW COVID VARIANTS

According to a new study by researchers from the University of Oxford, the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine provides a strong enough immune system response to protect against the new variants of the coronavirus found in the UK and South Africa, The Guardian reports.
The study, which has yet to be peer reviewed, had mixed but informative results. While the antibodies in those who had received their first shot of the vaccine were unable to neutralize the deadly South African variant known as B.1.351, the same group’s T-cells — a type of white blood cells that play a central role in the immune system — were effective against all known variants.
The antibodies in the same group were, however, able to fend off the highly transmissible UK variant, otherwise known as B117, as well as the original strain, moderately well.
While both antibodies and T-cells play important roles in our immune system, antibodies are only able to fight pathogens including the SARS-CoV-2 virus by attaching themselves to the outside of the pathogens. T-cells can both sense and destroy pathogens from inside infected cells and have lately become the subject of an increasing number of studies involving the coronavirus.

“It may not necessarily protect you against infection, but it’s very likely that this first dose will make it much easier for your immune system to make a good response the next time around,” William James, a professor of virology at the University of Oxford who co-authored the Pfizer study, told The Guardian.
“We think this is why that second dose produces such a good strong antibody response, because the T cells are already there, ready to react,” James explained.
Second doses, also commonly known as booster shots, were able to greatly increase the generation of antibodies, suggesting that they may play a more important role in the fight against the coronavirus than previously thought.
“In more than 90 percent of cases, the antibodies that people are generating after the second dose are up at the sort of level that neutralises the virus and which we would expect to protect them from infection,” James told The Guardian. “We’re pretty confident that they’ll be protected from infection by the South African strain and the Kent strain, as well as the [original] strain of the virus.”

The news comes just days after the COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical AstraZeneca was found to be ineffective against the South African variant. South Africa stopped its planned rollout of the vaccine on Sunday as a result.
In other words, scientists are still working night and day to understand the new variants — and our weapons against them.

I’m not saying that’s a bad thing. I think it’s a good thing, we’re well past due to reopen.

What I can’t understand is why Europe is so pro-lockdown. Quebec’s lockdown is by far the harshest in Canada. Meanwhile, France is getting roasted for being too soft with a lockdown that is equally as restrictive as Quebec’s plus an earlier curfew (6 PM vs 8:30). The UK talks about extending lockdown by over a month despite a huge chunk of the vulnerable population vaccinated. Ireland extended theirs by 6 weeks. Germany by 4. And they’re all significantly more strict than anything we’ve seen in NA.

GBS involves genetic and environmental factors, may be triggered by infections or vaccinations, and predisposition can be predicted by analyzing some of these factors.""

The scientific consensus on this is that without other risk factors, this is pretty negligible. Vaccinations by nature do not create some sort of unseen long-term complications. This is a fact that is not undermined by this data. 

Here's [a statement](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/guillain-barre-syndrome.html) from the CDC on this issue, ""Studies suggest that it is more likely that a person will get GBS after getting the flu than after vaccination.

To that fact comes that the EU was just late on investing/protecting in there own manufactioring (thanks to long negotiations with Pfizer/Biontech) , now only around one third of manufactiored Pfizer/Biontech vaccines stay in Europe.

Figure 1 documents the geographic dispersion of these protests over time, beginning on May 26, the first day following George Floyd’s death. The first large U.S. cities to experience protests were Minneapolis, Minnesota (May 26), the city where George Floyd was killed, followed by Memphis, Tennessee (May 27), and Los Angeles, California (May 27).

Whatever. Your entire post history is in insane covid denial subs. You aren't here for a conversation. You're here to spew a point of view debunked by every person with a career in public health. Of course now that we have a vaccine all the idiots are going to come back out and say ""SEE, LOOK HOW NICE IT IS TO BE NORMAL!"" Completely forgetting the fact that the only reason there were any downturns in cases or deaths were because of states and cities implementing restrictions in the complete absence of federal leadership. The fact that you point to Europe having to go back down on lockdown multiple times, while failing to mention the incredible success they had after the Spring of 2019 in containing their outbreaks is telling. They let off the brake and pretended everything was fine, and so then it came roaring back and tens of thousands of people died. That's not an argument against shutdowns lmfao

The answer was never permanent lockdown. We had a vaccine developed two days after the genome of Covid19 was sequenced. We simply had to wait for approval and distribution, and minimize loss of life through carefully considered and FEDERALLY GUIDED curtailment of public facing business combined with stimulus programs.

&amp;nbsp;

**Coachella**


The annual festival had originally planned to return in April after canceling the 2020 festival, but announced Jan. 29 that it was off this year as well. New dates were not announced.

Actually do you think he would rather die literally die than do that. also if you look at some of the other stuff he's lied about and how inconsequential it is.

Also politics-wise I think he would have fared better if he had actually just admitted he made an error after he caught covet and rallied the country being hind him to make some form of an attempt to get the virus under control.

&gt; February 12, 2021 - The result of the survey tells us that in our country, as well as in the rest of Europe (in France the prevalence is 20-25%, in Germany it is above 20%), there is a sustained circulation of the variant, which is likely to become the prevalent one in the coming months.

&gt; At the national level, the prevalence estimate of the so-called 'English variant' of the Sars-CoV-2 virus is 17.8%. These are the preliminary results of the 'flash survey' conducted by the ISS and the Ministry of Health together with the regional laboratories.

&gt; For the investigation, the laboratories of the Regions and Autonomous Provinces were asked to select sub-samples of positive cases and to sequence the genome of the virus, according to the procedures described in the circular of the Ministry of Health of last 8 February. The analyzed samples were a total of 852 for 82 laboratories, coming from 16 regions and autonomous provinces, broken down by population. The average result is in line with that of other surveys conducted in Europe. The range of prevalence seems to suggest a different maturity of the sub-epidemic probably determined by differences in the date of introduction of the variant itself. It is therefore likely that these differences will flatten out over time.

&gt; The result of the survey tells us that in our country, as well as in the rest of Europe (in France the prevalence is 20-25%, in Germany over 20%), there is a sustained circulation of the variant, which probably it is set to become the most prevalent in the coming months. The need to carefully monitor its prevalence stems from its greater transmissibility compared to the original virus. Careful monitoring would allow us, together with the strengthening of mitigation measures, to contain and stem the effects of the new variant while continuing with vaccinations, which remain effective even against the mutated virus.

&gt; In the coming days, the survey will be repeated, to verify the speed of diffusion of the new variant. The virus is constantly mutating and hundreds of variants have already been isolated, although most of these do not change the characteristics of the virus. Vigilance must remain high, however, to identify, as has already been done, those that could worsen the situation in terms of transmissibility, symptoms or sensitivity towards vaccines and antibodies, bearing in mind that the latter can still be modified to adapt them to the more dangerous versions.",,,1613141389,{},gn29uwi,True,t3_lich9u,False,True,t3_lich9u,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lich9u/prevalence_of_uk_variant_in_italy_is_178/gn29uwi/,1613141410,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

A couple notes about healthcare in the USA:

- Very poor people get free healthcare (Medicaid)
- Old people (&gt; 65 I think) get free healthcare (Medicare) (this doesn't include prescription coverage though - that must be purchased separately)
- Children &lt;= 26 years old are covered by their parents plan
- Most people get healthcare from their employer
- All insurance plans are federally required to have ""out of pocket maximums"". This means there's a hard limit on the most that you will ever have to pay while having insurance. Usually it's like $3,000 or $6,000. Yes it's a lot, but keep this in mind when you see those stories about people receiving $250,000 medical bills and going bankrupt. Unless they have no insurance, it's usually a bunch of bullshit.

The people who get screwed are those who make too much to qualify for Medicaid, but don't get coverage from their employer. These people usually make slightly over minimum wage in part time positions.

I suspect we'll see J&amp;J recipients veing advised to get a booster in the fall (mutant covering booster or otherwise) for this reason. The single shot methods just don't produce as high a level of circulating antibodies as the second booster.

While you're likely going to be protected from serious illness from just the single shot if infected with a mutant, it gives opportunity for more mutants to arrise and maybe generate one that completely escapes the vaccine.

Bruh. Name one first world western country that is not an island with strict border control that abolished covid and is 100% fully back to normal now. 

Remember how in France people couldn’t go more than like 1 km from their house and only at 7-8 am and  6-7 pm or something like that? Remember when in Spain and Italy people weren’t  even allowed outside? The UK is on lockdown number 4 or something right now. 

European countries took drastically stricter measures than the USA, and many of them are faring the same or worse right now in terms of deaths per million. Do you believe that if we just lock down harder, like in the UK, the virus will go away?

Heck, Melbourne supposedly abolished covid by locking down for over 4 months and now they have to lock down again. And they are part of an island country.

If they are required to wear a mask and are not then the onus is on you to report them to management and or the authorities.

The premise that lockdowns should last the whole pandemic is something no serious person has ever championed, so paying everyone's rent every month was never supposed to be on the table.

That said, the mRNA vaccines were designed and ready to test within weeks of getting the virus' genetic sequence, so I don't know how much time this effort will actually save when the next coronavirus pandemic emerges.  

And now that we have mRNA vaccine production capacity, as long as we keep those production lines running, e.g. by continuing to make booster shots for this virus, or using mRNA for more common flu vaccines, manufacturing won't be as much of a bottleneck for future mRNA vaccines.

It seems to me that the biggest speedup is going to come from speeding up the trials.  Phase I and II were done pretty quickly, phase III took the longest.  Speeding up trials is going to take some honest and hard evaluation of how much risk we're willing to accept.

We required two months of safety follow-up data from the Phase III trials before considering an EUA, when almost all severe vaccine side effects show up within a few days.  

The potential risk of low-incidence side effects that can only be found once you start dosing a lot of people, like Pandemrix causing narcolepsy in 1 out of every 18,400 patients, will have to be weighed against the certainty of allowing more people to die from the disease while you wait to analyze the data.

But I think your question is more of an epidemiological one than a biological one, per se. Because the overall question is, what are we trying to optimize? If we're trying to reduce the total amount of deaths in a population, that's an epidemiology question. If we're trying to protect individuals, that's a closer to an immunological/general biological question.

To answer your question, after all those caveats, I think it depends on where the rest of the community stands. If everyone over the age of 50 has had access to the vaccine (and we're basically just left with people who don't want it now), I think I would still focus on getting people the full two-dose vaccine, prioritizing specific younger people who are most likely to get exposed.

The reason why, is that I'm concerned about putting selective pressure on the virus to encourage it to evolve. If we vaccinate **a lot of people with a low efficacy**, then we're not crushing the virus and we're giving it a huge pressure to mutate into a new variant that can evade vaccines.

In other words, I worry that over the long-term, this ""half-dose everyone now"" strategy will seriously backfire by encouraging the evolution of new variants.

For the same reason, the western world needs to get its freaking act together and figure out a **global vaccination strategy** because if it's really true that poorer countries won't get vaccinated until 2022 or 2023, then they will become breeding grounds for variants to keep recurring over and over again until they render ***all*** of our vaccines useless.

EDIT: **TL;DR Vaccinating slowly and/or partially could seriously backfire by generating new variants through natural selection**. So, I sorta don't want to answer the original question because the only ""correct"" answer is to hurry the f\*\*\* up and get everyone fully vaccinated ASAP.",,,1613161385,{},gn3ikst,False,t3_li6lga,False,True,t1_gn3dyoq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/li6lga/daily_discussion_thread_february_12_2021/gn3ikst/,1613163692,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I know you people will continue to embarrass yourself defending Trudeau, but even if we got ALL of the syringes now - which would be [impossible](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/scramble-for-specialty-syringes-as-feds-and-pfizer-look-to-extract-sixth-vaccine-doses) - there is also a matter of TRAINING people.  You people keep thinking that just ordering a bunch of syringes will solve everything when **even the government** says it will not.   

&gt; Even with the specialized syringes, some provinces are reporting a problem drawing the sixth dose consistently. Some experts in British Columbia estimate that the sixth dose can only be drawn about half the time. “[Even if] everybody gets the best training, everyone is using the right syringe, we’re only going to get that sixth dose 75 per cent of the time, max,” Alberta’s health minister Tyler Shandro said Tuesday in response to the approval.

&gt;Then there’s the “human aspect” of green-lighting a six-dose regimen, said Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada’s deputy chief public health officer. “It’s not easy” to extract six doses from the vial, he said in French. “It’s not certain that in each vial, vaccinators will always be able to obtain those six doses,” he said.  “You perhaps need a certain level of experience. So then there’s the issue of training people who will administer the vaccine. It’s an issue and we’re working with stakeholders to improve this aspect.”

To reiterate, we are ONLY in this position of relying on special syringes which require training because Trudeau FAILED to get us the appropriate quantity of vaccines, the same way nearly [50 other countries](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-vaccinations-tracker.html) have been able to thus far.

In particular where I live (New York) we are currently on a steady downward trend (re: Deaths) since the holiday spike, but IHME has removed ""rapid vaccine rollout"" as a tab on their prediction model (which is weird, because vaccine rollout is going to be key for recovery) and they now just base their prediction on: their likely projection, universal mask wearing, variant spread, and the worse case scenario.

The model shows my state, without vaccine distribution, severely peaking again in mid-April and then steadily declining, with their projection being based on the variant spread. And then the ""worst case"" scenario red line is lower than all the other lines by June 1st.

Any answer you get that is either ""yes"" or ""no"" is wrong, for now. We have only ""maybe, probably not"", and it's going to be that way for a long time.

In order to answer the question scientifically, it would require a ""challenge study"" where both vaccinated and unvaccinated people are deliberately exposed to the virus to see if transmission occurs.

The ethical concerns of deliberate exposure prevent us from performing these studies in humans.  It's the same reason that the vaccine trials took so long, we can't deliberately infect people to see if they need hospitalization or die.

However, we did these studies in hamsters, and the results looked pretty bad. They were able to spread it. But hamsters greet each other by touching noses like all the time. Humans don't really do that (do you?). So we did similar studies with monkeys and the results look really good.

Also, you'll notice that any reputable person talking about this subject always says ""may be able to spread"", or ""maybe"", or ""we don't know if"". And that's because there is a very small chance that vaccinated people will be able to spread the virus. But it's not a big chance. Doctors, scientists, and regulators are being very careful with their language on this subject, some would argue they're being too careful. That said, if they were to say that ""vaccinated people cannot spread the virus"", and then we find out that in some situations that vaccinated people have spread the virus, that would end up worse for them than if they hedge for a while. So at least to me, the way they're framing it seems pretty reasonable, you just have to put yourself in their shoes.

**Continued from Above**

Looks like the amount of virus in people who've gotten one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and then infected is [greatly reduced compared to those not vaccinated](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfiqma/decreased_sarscov2_viral_load_following/).  This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a heavy reduction in ability to spread the virus.

Despite the news, it looks like at least the mRNA vaccines [*still* work](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfp89k/neutralization_of_sarscov2_spike_6970_deletion/) on the three most worrying variants.

[This was encouraging,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmp5doo/) regarding the efficacy of vaccines against variants.

[Yay!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmqfk4q/)

Just because [mRNA vaccines aren't 100% effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/)  against the SA variant, *doesn't* [mean that we'll definitely need boosters](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gmu581s/).


So just a thought about strategies to get the stragglers to get the jab.

Say it's September 2021, and there are a few million people left to vaccinate. If we gave a $1 tax break for getting the vaccine on your 2021 taxes, would it have any impact at all?

I'm thinking about the overlap of people who will fight to get back every dollar from the government and people who may be on the fence about the vaccine. It won't convince any antivaxxers, that's for sure. And you don't want it to seem like you're paying people to get the vaccine. Whatever strategy you use, it needs to be symbolic and cheap.

**Spike mutation analogy:**

The spike protein is coded by 3,831 base pairs.  What does that mean?

Well, it's like a lego sculpture where you have 3,831 words in the instructions for how to build it, and the writer had to be super-detailed when explaining each motion and piece.    

In this analogy, your immune system makes lego pieces (antibodies) that can attach to any pair of exposed bumps on the lego sculpture.  We'll say there are 40 pairs exposed in this example.

A variant is when the instructions change by just one or more words.  Sometimes the photocopier for the instructions page gets a tiny smudge.  This could be really bad sometimes, especially if it's a critical word or phrase, like ""left"" or ""repeat six times"" or a description of a particularly detailed lego piece. Color might not always matter, but size would.

Out of those 3,831 words, how many have to change so much that every one of those 40 spots is no longer there?  It's probably a lot.

But wait, how many words have to change to make the whole sculpture really different, so that it doesn't work as a sculpture anymore?  Really not that many if they're in the right spots, right?  This is why most variants suck at being viruses; it's rare that a mistake would make the instructions *better*.

**Which vaccine should I get?**

When someone asks me what my favorite beer is, the answer is always the same.

It's the one in front of me.

So get the first vaccine you can, the differences are pretty minor.

**Booster questions to think about, I don't have answers**

(note: there's a difference between ""boost"" and ""booster"" here that needs to be understood.)

(also, what's the term for a mixture of sequences, heterogenous? Is my doubt about this term just from overthinking?)

(also also, I'm not convinced we're definitely going to need boosters, this is just fun to think about.)

Could a booster shot replace the second dose of a prime/boost regimen?

Should a booster shot use only one sequence of mRNA (or have all identical spike proteins), or should it have both/multiple?

For future vaccines, should the sequence/spike be the same for prime/boost or different?  If you have four spikes/sequences, would it make more sense to do two in each, or all four in each?

How much should we trust mutation modeling here? Should we anticipate future mutations and include them?  Are we good enough at that yet?

Do we need to give any non-booster doses to people who have recovered from infection?

Could we ""stretch"" doses of an mRNA booster by priming with a vaccine that's easier to manufacture, but maybe less effective (like ChAdOx1), and boost with the mRNA booster?  Could it be better or faster to prime with a current mRNA sequence and boost with an updated ChAdOx1?  

[**Conclusions**](https://gfycat.com/cleantalkativedassie)

Okay, so the vaccines reduce infections, and if someone gets an infection after getting vaccinated, they have fewer and reduced symptoms.  This currently seems to also be true with post vaccination infection with any of the known variants. We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with mild symptoms spread only slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well. 

In other words: A reduction in symptoms is at least correlated with a reduction in the ability to spread the virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections and symptoms in those who do get infected. Therefore, vaccines should reduce spread.

If people develop immunity via clearing an infection, each subsequent variant they are exposed to will just broaden their immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). So they'll have good and broad immunity to a variety of variants, which seems likely to be an indication that they won't catch or spread the virus as well in the future. Same thing happens when someone who is vaccinated is exposed to a new variant. Their immunity is broadened and strengthened by each subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. But remember, so many people will be less likely to spread the virus, so it's pretty unlikely that this reduced level of spread will be sufficient to sustain the virus in the way we have seen over the past year. So if a variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. If they don't become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing to have my mind changed on this with new information though, so don't take this as gospel.

Do the vaccines work against variants? [Yes, probably better than you were expecting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l685dy/vaccination_against_the_new_variants_realworld/)

Pfizer [seems fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lf7uph/neutralization_of_viruses_with_european_south/) against the troubling variants, at least in the lab.

Still worried about variants? Check [this out!](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/01/27/vaccination-against-the-new-variants-real-world-data) *

Vaccine induced immunity is [comparable to](https://www.verywellhealth.com/antibodies-from-vaccines-and-from-natural-infection-5092564), or [better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l5whhu/increased_resistance_of_sarscov2_variants_b1351/) immunity from a previous infection. Especially [variants of concern.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgxpre/vaccineinduced_immunity_provides_more_robust/)

Post infection immunity lasts [*at least 8 months*](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/koxkm1/sarscov2_infection_induces_longlived_bone_marrow/), though [probably a lot longer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/klpvp7/sarscov2specific_t_cell_memory_is_longlasting_in/)  Again, [*at least* 8 months, though you may not even really need very many antibodies,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ldj06f/immunological_memory_to_sarscov2_assessed_for_up/) since other types of immunity seem to be more important.  It's too soon to say ""lifelong"" but [that is a possibility.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4nkco/the_immune_system_mounts_a_lasting_defense_after/) Also, it looks like those who have recovered *may* only need [one dose of an mRNA vaccine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/labst4/robust_spike_antibody_responses_and_increased/). There are some people (~7%) who don't develop lasting immunity from infections. 

Immunity from the vaccine [lasts *at least 6 months*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l9nfu8/stable_neutralizing_antibody_levels_six_months/) probably a lot,[ lot longer,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6a6pq/durability_of_responses_after_sarscov2_mrna1273/)  probably many years. 

The OG SARS virus from 2003 gave detectable immunity [both 6](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/12/7264) and [12 years later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kvbz9y/weekly_question_thread/gizs32j/)   

Covid19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, OG SARS was caused by SARS-CoV. Looks like both came from bats.  [They’re 79% the same.](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930251-8) (PDF)

[A few happy reminders](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ldstk0/daily_discussion_thread_february_06_2021/gmaem2l/).

Ignore news stories or blogs or comments that use “strain” instead of “variant”.  [There are currently no Covid19 “strains”, only variants.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC8ObD2W4Rk)

Most variants aren't great at being viruses.  [Some have already gone extinct](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/19/danish-covid-mink-variant-very-likely-extinct-but-controversial-cull-continues).

Because of its excellent safety record, promising anti-inflammatory properties, and wide availability and affordability, I propose that clinical trials with glycine as a mitigator of cytokine storms should be conducted as soon as possible in COVID-19 patients. It may be administered either orally in patients with moderate symptoms or intravenously in patients with severe symptoms at doses of 0.5–1.0 g/kg/day. In early stages of the disease, glycine may suppress or blunt the onset of virus-induced cytokine storm. In late stages of the disease, its cytoprotective effect may protect lung tissues from severe damage and ARDS, the leading cause of the mortality. Under these circumstances, it may be used in conjunction with other treatments. These include dexamethasone, which was shown to reduce cell death in advanced-stage patients (*32* ), radiotherapy, as reported recently (*14* ), or anti-viral agents such as remdesivir (*33* ).
