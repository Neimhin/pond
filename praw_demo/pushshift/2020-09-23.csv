This is the gist of it, pretty much. They're a comfort blanket for the people who don't feel safe or whatever and then they became a political statement. Meanwhile many Nordic countries even outside of sweden are doing fine and haven't mandated masks. There are states without mask mandates that managed okay, and states with them that managed badly.

This is my question. [They used just 14 samples](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05281-3), half positive and half negative. As far as I can tell they trained the dogs using the *same set of samples* that they used to test the dogs.

How do we know the dogs were discriminating based on coronavirus and not some other characteristic of the 14 individuals that they recognized from their training? 

For example, if you showed me portraits of 14 people thousands of times and gave me a reward every time I picked one who happened to be COVID-19 positive I could get to 100% accuracy, too. That doesn't mean I'd be any good at screening random people in an airport.

**Managers and management of nursing homes did not take the coronavirus seriously when the spread of infection was at its worst.** **If there are testimonies from nursing homes across the country.** **The criticism concerns, among other things, staff who have been forced to work without protection and say they have been silenced by the management.** **This is shown by Ekot's survey of hundreds of cases received by the Swedish Health and Care Inspectorate.**

\- Staff ran between the wards and anxious dementia patients who went back and forth, it was complete chaos, says the assistant nurse Birgitta.  


She is one of those who think that in her workplace it should have been realized earlier that it was important to separate the sick from the infected.

\- When you came and asked for protective clothing, you got two mouth guards to share, the hand alcohol was refilled, but nothing else, she continues.

Since the first case of covid-19 was found in a Swedish nursing home, more than 800 tips, comments and complaints have been received by the Swedish Health and Care Inspectorate, IVO, which concerns nursing homes during the pandemic.

**Ekot has gone through all the** complaints and a large part of the tips that came in to IVO during the spring and summer. At the beginning of the pandemic, people who say they work in specific homes are alerted. Many cases concern that the management has not taken the spread of infection seriously, among other things by not distinguishing the sick from healthy, suspected infected people has not been isolated until test results have been received.

Several testify that they tried to point out the shortcomings to the management, without results and some have experienced that nursing homes tried to obscure how serious the situation really was. Many who report do so anonymously and among those with whom Ekot still gets in touch, few dare to speak. The assistant nurse Birgitta is actually called something else.

\- I understand that you can not order a million mouth guards that should be enough for everyone. It can not be easy, everyone was taken to bed.

 \- On the other hand, I think that perhaps you could have taken this seriously that you should not run between the departments. There, I think you could have taken in with the hard gloves right away, she says.

**Many call on IVO** to carry out inspections at their workplaces. The tips and complaints come from all over the country, but most of them concern our metropolitan regions. A person in western Sweden writes:

*“There is a human tragedy going on in silence!* *We have been left to our fate, both residents and staff.* *Those who are still working go from infected wards to healthy ones.* *No risk of spreading… Cover.* *No one may provide information to either residents or relatives ”.*

**Åsa Furén-Thulin** , head of social services in Sweden's municipalities and regions, believes that the situation in nursing homes now looks completely different, that they have learned a lot and that the managers also had a very tough time during this period.

\- I think of the enormous frustration and pain and how hard it must have been for both managers and employees and especially for users as well. It has been such a tough journey but I think a lot of this is about ignorance and despair and not being enough.

But it can take days or even weeks for the NCBI to look at a submission, and given the gravity of the situation and buoyed by the urging of colleagues, Zhang chose to expedite its release to the public, by publishing it online.

I noticed before corona that this year sickness would spread very quickly through my building so I started taking precautions because I have been so sick recently.
Aerosol spread is the highest risk however you cannot guarantee that the person who placed your produce on the shelf or scanned your produce at the till is not infected and has followed the correct guidelines.
In my country there are political parties and church members that are publicly going door to door saying corona is bullshit.
Actually encouraging people to go against the Government protection guidelines.
So I feel confident and happy in the way I live my life in regards to shopping and how I clean my produce I’m not doing anything crazy or over the top and there are studies out there showing live virus is on packaging.

Computations:

Take the true mortality rate - 0.65%\*\* - and multiply it by 100 divided by the number of U.S. Covid-19 deaths, and you have the best estimate of true number of infected persons in the U.S.:    30.9 million

Apply this to the number of deaths a month ago and you can see about 3.7 million infections per month.  Divide the US population (\~350 million) by that and you get 93 months or 7.8 years of social distancing before entire population is infected.  If you really only care about herd immunity of 70% (245 million Americans), then 65 months or 5.4 years of social distancing is required.

You claimed that Sweden would have less cases if the public health agency recommended the wearing of face masks. Now if you want to to concede the point and make a new claim that's fine. But if you don't, such a claim entails more evidence than just proving that the masks themselves work as intended, because you're operating with a context where we now that culture, group psychology etc has noticeable effects.

&gt; You refuted this evidence by asking for a study done on the entire population of Sweden

I did not. I've asked for studies performed on a population *scale* in a real life-setting.
&gt; *In sociology, population refers to a collection of humans. Demography is a social science which entails the statistical study of populations. Population, in simpler terms, is the number of people in a city or town, region, country or world; population is usually determined by a process called census (a process of collecting, analyzing, compiling and publishing data).*

&gt; It doesn’t have to be 100% calculated out perfectly.

Of course not, but a public agency in a democratic society can not legitimately take actions that are not evidence-based. They have a massive responsibility and you can't gamble to that degree with the public health of an entire nation. Just because *you*, who have no expertise within the relevant scientific fields, can't imagine any difference between masks effect on an individual scale and a population scale, doesn't mean that there are no such differences. You are aware of ""emergent properties"", right?

&gt; We’ve shown that it is better than the alternative

Have we, where?

&gt; What reasons could you possibly imagine masks will behave differently on a mass scale?

The masks themselves will obviously not behave differently. That's not being questioned. It's the effects of mask *usage* that can differ between a single individual in a lab setting and a nation wide population in every-day life.

The point that the Swedish Public Health Agency is making is that there's not enough evidence to recommend nation-wide mask usage, and I feel like we're at a point where you and them agree, that no such evidence does in fact exists. Then there could be a difference in opinion, where you think that they should recommend masks anyway, while they think they shouldn't.

But there are more RCTs of early-stage treatment with does say that it does not work when I search for it and not many who state it does work, but also scientists who state the jury is still out because of cancellation.

See this article for an overview: [Can Hydroxychloroquine prevent COVID-19?

&gt;White and his colleagues are frustrated, to put it mildly. Hydroxychloroquine, they complained in a press release this month, was “being prematurely discarded in COVID-19 prevention.” Two recent prevention studies have come up negative, but outside experts say they are not the last word.

The assumption in public education has to be that nothing is done in the home unless the school requires it. Otherwise it's a nihilistic race to the bottom.

The American school system fails, not least, in refusing to acknowledge that different kids have different ultimate destinations. Low-cost education should go all the way through medical school as well as trade school, with only merit and predilection to decide who gets to do what. This approach has worked wonders in all other industrialized nations. But it would cost the financial sector too much money. All that interest on student debt wouldn't be buying their yachts any more.

Their manufacturing capabilities alone could crank out billions more dosages per year than Moderna or Pfizer ever could. They have also recruited double the amount of participants and from diverse ethnic groups around the world, thus making their data extremely valuable to the FDA....And again, if Pfizer has a vaccine that is a *two-shot*, then 100 million dosages gets cut in half. Because people need to get one shot and then return a month later for a second one. That requires not only compliance from the person to follow up, but also double the amount of dosages, needles, and storage requirements at medical clinics.

I don't mean any of this in a bad way. Just that having the mixture of all these vaccine candidates will be good - and yes, still very useful to Americans as well as let's say people in Africa or Latin America. J&amp;J's advanced capabilities will provide relief to anyone that has rural access issues, which there is still *a lot* of in the U.S.

All this to say that if Pfizer is looking at October/November, J&amp;J is looking at December/January.

Covid-19 may have become more contagious as it has mutated, the largest genetic study carried out in the US into the virus has suggested

&gt; Covid-19 may have become more contagious as it has mutated, the largest genetic study carried out in the US into the virus has suggested, as scientists warn it could be adapting to interventions such as mask-wearing and social distancing.

&gt; ...

&gt; By failing to control the spread in the US - which has the highest number of cases in the world - the virus has been given more opportunity to mutate in a shorter amount of time.

&gt; David Morens, a virologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), told the Washington Post the findings point to the possibility that the virus has become more transmissible and that this “may have implications for our ability to control it”.

&gt; Mr Morens cautioned that it was only one study that had not yet been peer-reviewed and “you don’t want to over-interpret what this means”. But the virus, he said, could potentially be responding -  through mutations - to such interventions as hand-washing and social distancing.

&gt; “Wearing masks, washing our hands, all those things are barriers to transmissibility, or contagion, but as the virus becomes more contagious it statistically is better at getting around those barriers,” said Mr Morens, senior adviser to Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of NIAID.

&gt; As a rule, the more genetic diversity a virus has the more prepared it is to evolve away from future treatments and vaccines. 
Other virologists downplayed the importance of the study, saying much is still unknown about the various mutations of the virus and how virulent they are.
&gt; Studying mutations in detail, however, could be important for controlling the pandemic. It might help to pre-empt the most worrying of mutations - those that could help the virus to evade immune systems, vaccines or antibody therapies.",,,1600961791,{},g6fn1b2,False,t3_iyxnpr,False,True,t3_iyxnpr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iyxnpr/daily_discussion_post_september_24_questions/g6fn1b2/,1600962589,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

And how is that better than testing an antibody directly? It's certainly more expensive. From what I've read, T cells tend to be less specific because they cross react with other similar coronaviruses. That might be helpful in that the global population was not as naïve to SARS-CoV-2 as initially though, however, that remains to be determined. Either way, that would apply to all populations, right? Not just Sweden. 

T cells are more persistent which is good for long-term studies and immunity. But antibodies don't deplete within the ~6 months that covid had been spreading. In fact, short term antibodies are higher than tcells. See fig 1B.

1.) Identify when and if the numbers start rising 

2.) Communicate before there is a real risk of R increasing rapidly and that is serious 

3.) Let the citizens act before putting strict policies in place. 

4.) On a daily basis monitor how this is working, and if other measurements needs to be considered.

For example the reason they didnt shut down schools are because lack of education will have serious consequences in the long run on both society and individual children.

They also used leftist methods to fight the virus. They could have just locked people up in their homes it would have been much much cheaper, atleast in the short run.

That is actually a common misconception. Quoting this [source](https://yorkspace.library.yorku.ca/xmlui/handle/10315/29368):

&gt; We know from research in both Canada and the United States that while many Canadians may experience
&gt; homelessness at one time or another, for most it usually lasts for only a short time. Many get through their
&gt; homeless experience while being provisionally accommodated, that is, while staying with friends or relatives.
&gt; Even if we consider the ‘emergency sheltered’ population, the majority are homeless for a short time. As
&gt; reported in the State of Homelessness in Canada: 2013, the **median length of stay in emergency shelter is
&gt; approximately 50 days**, most people are homeless for less than a month (24-29% stay only one night) and
&gt; they generally manage to leave homelessness on their own, usually with little support (Segaert, 2012). This
&gt; group, considered to be **transitionally homeless, makes up 88-94%** of the homeless population (Aubry et
&gt; al., 2013) and for most of these people homelessness is usually a one-time event.
&gt; For a smaller but significant percentage of the population, homelessness is considered a longer-term
&gt; problem. People considered to be episodically homeless (3-11% of the population) move in and out of
&gt; homelessness, have been continually homeless for under a year but may have experienced several episodes
&gt; over the previous three years. This includes between 6,000 and 22,000 individuals annually in Canada.
&gt; Chronically homeless refers to individuals who have been on the streets
&gt; for a long time, potentially years. Interestingly, the number of chronically
&gt; homeless people in Canada, as a percentage of the homeless population is
&gt; between 2-4% and is considerably lower than in the United States (10%).

The basic idea of herd immunity is that enough people will be immune to lower the current reproduction number, R, to be below 1, so less people every generation are infected and the disease will die out.

in the Fact Sheets are unlikely to produce an antiviral effect.

not been consistently replicated and recent data from a randomized controlled trial
assessing probability of negative conversion showed no difference between HCQ
and standard of care alone.

&gt;• Current U.S. treatment guidelines do not recommend the use of CQ or HCQ in
hospitalized patients with COVID-19 outside of a clinical trial, and the NIH
guidelines now recommend against such use outside of a clinical trial.

&gt;• Recent data from a large randomized controlled trial showed no evidence of
benefit for mortality or other outcomes such as hospital length of stay or need for
mechanical ventilation of HCQ treatment in hospitalized patients with COVID19.",,,1600918272,{},g6dwfq6,False,t3_ixxeoh,False,True,t1_g6axpp0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ixxeoh/open_letter_docs4opendebate/g6dwfq6/,1600921275,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Currently the medical community is made up of people that must all be a certain way. If you are a doctor and agree with the community on 99.9% of the current status quo but disagree on a couple key areas, they can and will remove your license for going against their standards. Which means the medical community could possibly be wrong and there is nothing anyone can do about it. Fortunately this seems to be rare.

However should they become wrong about something and stick to their guns about it, we'd all be screwed.

One area for improvement - your local family care. Often these people are overeducated compared to their role. We could potentially reduce the costs of medical work significantly if we had a cheaper first layer of care. Their role is normally to treat very simple ailments and direct you to the proper professionals. ""looks like your arm is broken. Get an xray and I'll give you a cast."" ""Your son has an ear infection. take this once a day until the bottle is gone."" ""You've got a problem with your skin that could be a number of things. you're better off speaking with a dermatologist. Our office can recommend a number of local options.""

For example: Both my wife and, and my father-in-law thought we had the virus in late March.  We all had Kaiser and we all wanted to get tested. 

At the time, the policy was that you could only get a test if you were a) hospitalized, or b) over 60 years old. 

None of us were hospitalized, but my father-in-law was over 60, so he could get a test while we could not.

And I don't understand how you don't understand that the question I asked was in relation to the reported school-related cases. Generalized (and widely varied, depending on who you listen to) projections aren't what I asked for. I don't understand how you don't understand the question. If you had X amount of cases, how many of those resulted in any significant illness? If none, then the anti-maskers will use that proof they were right. If MOST, maybe some minds will change. But simply reporting, ""we had x more positives"" doesn't cut it - they KNOW there are more positives. In fact, those who support the herd immunity are THRILLED there are more positives. What is the IMPACT is the question. Mathematically. Statistically.

Just watching 4 months of talking heads on the news and saying, ""people died"" doesn't cut it, either. Maybe most of the population that died was on their deathbed anyways and the next cold or flu would've finished them off anyways. And don't even go down that rathole controversy about how COVID stats are (or are not, depending on who you talk to) being reported.

Early in the pandemic here in Florida, we got access to a map that showed each county and how many people tested positive in each area. I checked the map to see where I should grocery shop (this was before mask mandates and widely available curbside/delivery—dangerous shopping). 

I chose a store kind of close that was in a presumably low positive area. A few days later my local paper published an article warning people to not take the maps too seriously because it was reporting testing site data, not zip codes of infection people. So a “hot spot” area really meant it had virus testing, not that people in that area tested positive. People from all over the county could drive to those sites and then go back to where ever they lived. 

Anyway, that same week some grocery employees at the “safer area” store I went to tested positive.

The map I read was worse than worthless, and I’ll never allow a map to influence my sense of whether or not something is “safer” again.

Perfect health isn’t, and shouldn’t be, the sole priority of a society. We could cut traffic deaths to 0 by having all speed limits at 20km/h. Or we could lock down for every flu season. Or ban all fast food. Not only are there economic consequences of these measures, but there are ideological ones too, concerning the rights and freedoms of citizens in western style democracies. 

I’m not saying Sweden did it right (or wrong), and I’m no rabid anti-lockdowner.

Edit: From the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_proteomics) page:

&gt; Biomedical applications  
Quantitative proteomics has distinct applications in the medical field. Especially in the fields of drug and biomarker discovery. LC-MS/MS techniques have started to over take more traditional methods like the western blot and ELISA due to the cumbersome nature of labeling different and separating proteins using these methods and the more global analysis of protein quantification. Mass spectrometry methods are more sensitive to difference in protein structure like post-translational modification and thus can quantify differing modifications to proteins. Quantitative proteomics can circumvent these issues, only needing sequence information to be performed. Disadvantages, however, in sensitivity and analysis time must be kept in consideration.[20]

&gt; Drug discovery  
Quantitative proteomics has the largest applications in the protein target identification, protein target validation, and toxicity profiling of drug discovery.[21] Drug discovery has been used to investigate protein-protein interaction and, more recently, drug-small molecule interactions. Thus, it has shown great promise in monitoring side-effects of small drug-like molecules and understanding the efficacy and therapeutic effect of one drug target over another.[22][23] One of the more typical methodologies for absolute protein quantification in drug discovery is the use of LC-MS/MS with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The mass spectrometry is typically done by a triple quadrupole MS.[21]",,,1600922495,{},g6e2lhl,False,t3_ixzrka,False,True,t3_ixzrka,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ixzrka/quantitative_proteomics_reveals_a_broadspectrum/g6e2lhl/,1600924255,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1600922769.0,,

If they are a co-operative then they are more cautious with both staff and members because everyone has or can have a vested interest.  And it looks really bad when several members of the BOD and the investors are ill.

Non-profit organizations suffer at the hands of getting whatever funds they can get through donation, grants, federal subsidies, etc...and they scrimp and scrape, and do whatever they can to make ends meet.  They do the best they can with what they are given, but sometimes that is not enough.

No.  The company would have fired her for not showing up for her shift, yet also did nothing to prevent the spread of disease within the walls of its facility.

I'm doing that in the US, and as a culture/nation, it doesn't nearly have the reputation for socially and personally responsible behavior (relative to the Nordic countries).

Long term I'm also not going to those places even after a vaccine is developed and it is a distant memory. Their willingness to open and expose customers and employees gives me zero-confidence that they will take other health threats (e.g., food borne illness, employees without sick leave, etc.) seriously.

The places that stayed closed even after re-opening was allowed, or that remained delivery only when in-person dining was briefly allowed, are the places that have a future as far as my business is concerned.

The claim is that wearing face masks does more to prevent the transmission of coronaviruses than not wearing face masks. I have provided ample evidence of this claim. You refuted this evidence by asking for a study done on the entire population of Sweden, which, of course, is laughable. 

If we have evidence masks help on an individual level, do you really have reason to believe they don’t help on a population scale? I agree that I would like to see some population scale statistics when this is all said and done, but, and I don’t know if you’ve noticed the situation we’re in, we don’t really have time to set that shit up. We’re not trying to land on Mars. It doesn’t have to be 100% calculated out perfectly. We’ve shown that it is better than the alternative, which is good enough for precautionary action in a crisis.

Yeah, but that doesn't mean immunity doesn't exist. It also doesn't mean that everyone is *currently* sick - it means that transmission doesn't occur because the virus is repelled by the immune systems of those who do not currently have the virus to such an extent that each ill person infects, on average, less than one other person.

In addition to straightforward reinfection due to lack of immunity you have to account for:

1. False positives (rare, but if alleged cases of reinfection are rare, in the absence of DNA comparisons, false positives will have a disproportionate effect);
2. Cases where there was a technical infection only but no immune response needed (i.e., where there was a small amount of virus present when the test sample was taken, but that failed to thrive) — a ""reinfection"" could of course be much more severe because the body is still naive to the threat;
3. Cases where there was no sterilizing response and therefore no antibodies, so an infection can reoccur — but where there is still a sufficient immune response to significantly reduce the virulence on the second occasion.

Yes,  the second infection could also be more serious; but the number of infections declined significantly once this threshold was reached, as the modelling would predict.",,,1600952370,{},g6f47zz,False,t3_iyw12e,False,True,t1_g6f2tle,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iyw12e/brazilian_city_ravaged_by_coronavirus_reached/g6f47zz/,1600952381,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

This number of amplification cycles needed to find the virus, called the cycle threshold, is never included in the results sent to doctors and coronavirus patients, although it could tell them how infectious the patients are.

In three sets of testing data that include cycle thresholds, compiled by officials in Massachusetts, New York and Nevada, up to 90 percent of people testing positive carried barely any virus, a review by The Times found.

Tests with thresholds so high may detect not just live virus but also genetic fragments, leftovers from infection that pose no particular risk — akin to finding a hair in a room long after a person has left, Dr. Mina said.""",,,1600925850,{},g6e6p6m,False,t3_iyovo6,False,True,t1_g6dzxdy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iyovo6/second_covid19_wave_has_already_started_pm_in/g6e6p6m/,1600926218,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

A few months ago, many U.S. states, including California, Texas, and Arizona, were seeing an alarming spike in cases. After initial bouts of reluctance, they made the right choice and reversed some of their reopening measures. California even went as far as ordering a second lockdown, which still has not been lifted (rightfully so, for they are still seeing high numbers of cases and deaths each day, but that's another story...)

Many skeptics were understandably angered. They did not wish to see all of ""their"" movements to end the lockdowns and return to normal as soon as possible come to a sudden end. So they threw at us these wack and absurd excuses disguised as logical fallacies, such as ""herd immunity"" and ""shifting the goalposts"", in order to justify keeping their states open, in defiance of the common public health consensus that places can and *should* reverse reopening if the numbers are no longer in their favor. Among these excuses was the idea that deaths were not rising because the virus had already swept through most of the vulnerable population. This, they reasoned, was why *all* places that saw second surges in *cases* did *not* see equivalent surges in *deaths*. They jeered at news articles and political statements that falsely predicted rising deaths in a certain timeframe, such as ""two weeks"".

Eventually, however, deaths *did* spike. In *all three states that I mentioned*, the surge in deaths arrived *exactly* as projected; the only mistake was in the date. When the surge did come, the skeptics were aghast, and at a loss for words. At first, they found themselves *unable* to explain away the increase in COVID deaths, and even had trouble thinking of what to do. And so, they haughtily degraded their platforms, desperately resorting to various different sorts of conspiracy bullshit (as if their dogma *weren't* conspiratorial *enough* already). Some insisted that the official statistics on their state government briefings and websites were being artificially inflated by retroactively listing deaths that were discovered to have fallen on previous days. Others claimed that the death surge was nothing but an *illusion* caused by increased testing availability. Fortunately for us, the skeptics' arguments were not convincing, and were largely mocked by sane people, including virtually all governments.

now _that_ sounds like an agenda :) lol.

FFS dude - get the BEST data you can from the BEST people you can (including Dr Fauci as ONE OF them) then make the best decision you can at the time

that's all you can do.   Then adjust as necessary.   But use DATA.  Use experts. Use reason.  Don't use feelings or politics, they suck.

It's interesting you bring up the mask thing,  I was just reading this from NIH.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7313827/

""Although the evidence was judged ‘low certainty’, the analysis found no significant advantage of N95 over medical masks [11]. While premature to draw firm conclusions, these results suggest that the contribution of fine aerosolized particles to infectious spread of viral respiratory disease may be limited.""

Which speaks directly to your point except prior to covid a mask usually meant a surgical or n95.

I found this interesting but actually kind of makes sense if we are seeing reduced transmission with cloth face coverings... the larger droplets are getting stopped by the mask so an N95 isn't needed like it might be for a truly airborne virus.

https://www.hrw.org/topic/international-justice/international-criminal-court

Who does that? Criminals who are violating international standards for human rights

&gt;The ICC represents and constitutes part of a global system of international justice of which the United States was a chief architect at Nuremberg and beyond. Today, the ICC, alongside other tribunals, regional mechanisms, and national courts, is carrying forward these efforts through investigations and prosecutions that could help realize justice for atrocity victims from Sudan to Myanmar. As a court of last resort, the ICC only can intervene when and where a State has demonstrated unwillingness or inability to hold its nationals to account for crimes within the Court’s jurisdiction. The ICC therefore provides an essential backstop for victims who have no other recourse to justice. The use of sanctions has the potential for wide-reaching impact against this institution dedicated to advancing justice for victims.

Convenient that Trump, who is running concentration camps, is sanctioning the International watchdog body, eh? Very Hitler-esque

To summarize:

1. Trump runs concentration camps

You come in saying ""it can't be concentration camps because UN isn't intervening"".

2. But Trump sanctioned the ICC which is the UN org that's supposed to intervene.

You: ""HOW IS THAT RELEVANT!!!!!!!!""

Maybe if Obama had at least cut the debt to GDP ratio I could have overlooked it a bit, but he didn't. Also you should know that the entire deficit reduction under Obama was a function of the Fed's QE program which reduced interest rates on government debt significantly, thereby single handedly reducing our deficit by well over 600B. If not for the Fed's QE program, our deficit would have gone up. So it seems hard to credit Obama for what was the Fed's monetary policies. What makes it worse is that it put us in a position that will take decades to recover. The Fed can never end the QE program in its entirety for decades. Maybe 2050 at the soonest if we start working for it right now. Instead they continue to alter it over the last 12 years or so. It can't be removed in its entirety because we now rely on that lower rate. Removal of their programs would put us into a very dangerous place with inflation. There is simply too much baked in risk now.

2, When you combine science and politics, all you get is politics. It's just blatantly obvious that Dr Fauci has so much to say, but he didn't, guess why?

3, J&amp;J has a terrible track record, just put asbestos behind and Google it I guess?

4, If these vaccines will be out this year they will be authorized under EUA, they are rushed,and no vaccine was ever developed in this kind of timeframe, and who knows if this has anything to do with the election this year. Also there are some skptism on the approval process, FCC basically let Boeing themselves to authorize 737MAX and guess what happend? Does the executives go to jail?

No.

5, I don't know if you've played Plague Inc. but the takeaway is a pathogen can not be leathal and contagious at the same time, if you make it too lethal at the beginning you ended lose the game, your virus just eradicated itself, by itself.

My intuition before the shit hit the fan is that this pathogen will get more contagious but less leathal as it transmit from people to other people to other people, mutations that makes the virus more contagious get passed on and does the recent studies on D614G  and the statistics on CFR lines it up nicely. World's largest comparison group, Sweden, seems to be doing a fairly well, at least it doesn't do any worse than other EU countries.

Listen, I love dogs. I love dogs with jobs. I think they're *great*.

However, double-blind controlled tests with sniffer dogs in almost *any* capacity generally shows that accuracy drops off super rapidly with time. And in some cases the real accuracy is absolutely abysmal compared to what the trainers claim. It's important to note that the ""close to 100% accuracy"" claim is coming from the people training/selling the dogs to the program. I'm not saying they're lying. I'm saying they need to prove it and prove it darn well. Someone succeeds in smuggling some drugs past a border crossing? That's bad. Someone contagious gets on a plane with COVID? I think that's worse.

I'm tempted to say that what we need is dogs+machines. Where a dog can flag some people and then we confirm it with a machine. But sadly, that would still leave the dogs' false negative results getting through.

We have to have reliable results and I just don't think dogs are the way to go. They're cute. They have amazing noses. They can also be flighty and most importantly *they can't talk.* They can't tell us when they're unsure.

Are we done with coronavirus? Why are people doing these things? It seems that people continue to act as life is completely normal, pushing back all opportunities I have for work. Cases continually rise as people go to schools and gather for stupid shit.

This has been tested to be incorrect. Your figure seems to have been pulled out of your ass. Viruses aren't gasses. Despite the size of a virus being incredibly small, they don't exist in the air by themselves. So people saying that they are X microns doesn't matter. The majority of the time the virus is traveling on a micro droplet that is many times larger than the virus itself and large enough to be caught by many masks, even cloth ones can capture significant amounts. 

And your ""exposed"" condition is insufficient. Let's throw some made up numbers to illustrate a point. If you get exposed to 50 virus particles, you are exposed. If you get exposed to 100 virus particles, you are exposed. And yet, the science, that isn't concerned about your feelings, as you put it, is indicating to us that the 50 particle exposure may mean you get a mild case and the 100 particle exposure means you are going into the ICU. So, despite being ""exposed"" in both of these instances, I'm going to elect to be ""exposed"" to only 50 particles and give myself a fighting chance.

Example: 
* Two countries with the exact same population (10M) and real world infection rates (0.5%) have two very different testing strategies and capabilities. 
* Country 1 only has the capacity of 1000 tests. Who would you test? The people in the hospitals with COVID symptoms. You would probably get a 50% positive rate. 
* Country 2 has the capacity of 10M tests for the 10M people. They test everyone. And the positive rate would be 0.5%. 

Now to use your own “straight forward calculation” method, that would mean that the analysis would show that:
* Country 1 has 5M active cases
* Country 2 has 50 000 active cases (true number)

Ergo, the more you test, the less positive cases you find per test. Positive rate matters.

Pablo Linde
Madrid - 23 sep 2020 - 10:29 CEST

The new figures on the coronavirus crisis in Spain are increasingly resembling those seen during the peak of the pandemic in March and April. According to the official report released last night by the Spanish Health Ministry, 241 deaths have been added to the official toll – the second highest figure of the second wave of Covid-19. Not all of these fatalities, however, took place in the last 24 hours. This number also includes coronavirus deaths that happened on earlier dates but had not yet been added to the official toll. During the first wave, Spain recorded up to 950 deaths a day, using the same reporting method.
-

The Health Ministry recorded 10,799 new coronavirus cases in the official report released on Tuesday. But this cannot be compared to the number of infections during the first wave, given that Spain now has greater capacity to detect new cases. Where before, health authorities were only carrying out tests on the most serious infections; now they are also detecting minor and asymptomatic cases.
-

    As the number of coronavirus cases rises, so too has the number of patients requiring hospitalization and intensive care

The percentage of hospital beds occupied by coronavirus patients has also risen to 9.6%. But the situation is worse in the intensive care units (ICUs). On Tuesday, the Health Ministry published for the first time the ICU occupancy rate in Spain: 16.8% of all intensive care beds in Spain are occupied by Covid-19 patients. This figure varies greatly between the regions. La Rioja has the highest rate at 56.7%, followed by Madrid (36.3%) and Aragón (32.5%). The regions with the lowest occupancy rate are Galicia (4.48%), Asturias (4.53%), Extremadura (8.79%) and the Canary Islands (9.15%). The remaining regions have more than 10% of ICU beds occupied by coronavirus patients. Importantly too, the occupancy rate is not only based on the core number of ICU beds available but also on the extensions to these services.
-

This data point is key because it ultimately determines the scope and severity of the measures aimed at curbing contagion. When ICUs are overwhelmed, authorities have no other choice but to introduce more drastic measures in a bid to ease the pressure. This happened in the spring, when the entire Spanish economy was “hibernated” to prevent ICUs from reaching the breaking point.

The state of Spain’s ICUs reflect, with a few weeks of difference, the rise in diagnosed coronavirus cases. More infections are being detected now than in March – many of which are minor and asymptomatic – but as the number of cases rises, so too has the number of patients requiring hospitalization and intensive care.

    The cumulative incidence of Covid-19 in Madrid has risen to 746.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, compared to the national average of 287.7

The epidemic continues to rise in almost all of Spain’s 17 regions. Madrid continues to have the highest 14-day cumulative incidence of Covid-19, with 746.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, followed by Navarre (622.7), where there has been a surge in cases; La Rioja (444.5); Aragón (388.1), where numbers have risen again after a weeks-long downward trend; and Castilla-La Mancha (383.6), which has also seen a sharp spike in infections. The national average is 287.7. The only region with an incidence rate below 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants is Asturias (98.26), which has the lowest rate in Spain, followed by Galicia (114.4) and Valencia (115).

While these regions have the lowest incidence rate in Spain, they are still far above most other European countries: Germany (24.9), Italy (32.1), the United Kingdom (69.1) and Portugal (80.8). In most of Europe, the trend is on the rise, particularly in France which now has 182.9 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.",,,1600931440,{},g6edljg,True,t3_iysgac,False,True,t3_iysgac,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iysgac/spain_adds_241_coronavirus_deaths_to_official/g6edljg/,1600931450,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

uh...you might want to expand your media intake a bit.  By early July in the US our 7 day average for deaths got as 'low' as the high 400s.  A month later we were averaging 1,200 a day and we have yet to dip below 750.  

Here in Texas and in places like Florida and Arizona hospitals were coming dangerously close to capacity - what saved us was the governors waking up to reality and rolling back openings (bars have been closed in Texas since June 26, although there are some exceptions)

You want to talk Georgia?  They saw [a huge spike in cases and deaths](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/georgia-coronavirus-cases.html) 

New Hampshire?  You really love to cherry-pick stats, but let's go with it.  Their 7-day-average for new cases was down to 15 when they reopened restaurants, now it has more than doubled.  That said, the number is still really low and maybe they won't see a spike.  

Either way, not a great example since their largest city has a population of 100,000 people.  And you want to compare it with MA?  They have 5 cities larger than that, including Boston which has a population 7 times larger.  Population density matters.  Not to mention that New Hampshire sees a hell of a lot less travelers than, say, Boston.

Also important to note, NH did not ""fully"" open restaurants - they still require 6 foot table spacing and people are not allowed to congregate standing at bars. For most restaurants 6 foot table spacing puts you at roughly half pre-pandemic capacity.  

And hate to break it to you, but MA is also allowing indoor dining at 6 foot spacing.  And yes, it makes sense they're being cautious since [the CDC has confirmned restaurants are a source of spread](https://www.masslive.com/dining/2020/09/covid-19-spread-linked-to-dining-at-restaurants-cdc-says.html)

I did find this though

&gt;More than half of New York households (53%) use individual window/wall air conditioning units, while only 20% have a central system.

This is compared to \~40% central air usage for the Mid-atlantic region, and \~60% for the US (2009 figures). In addition, this is NYS, which is going to be more in line with the mid-atlantic - NYC is very different in makeup and I would imagine is much higher in window unit percentage. In addition, households that have central air are going to be smaller than households without so there's that skew as well with respect to sheer quantity of people.

[https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/reports/2009/state\_briefs/pdf/NY.pdf](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/reports/2009/state_briefs/pdf/NY.pdf)

Even if you compare just regions (which are urban and rural) you see a vast difference,

&gt;44% North East, 76% Midwest, 85% South, 74% West

[https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/reports/2009/air-conditioning.php](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/reports/2009/air-conditioning.php)

And this is mostly why:

&gt;Around 75 percent of the buildings throughout the five boroughs were constructed before 1960, according to the NYC Department of Buildings. Central air became mainstream later in the 1960s, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Retrofitting an old building with central air is expensive and complicated, so most New York buildings don’t go to the trouble of making that renovation.  
&gt;  
&gt;“New York City’s buildings are historic, many are prewar, and they just don’t have the space for air to pass through the walls,” said Adam Dahill, owner of Dahill &amp; Bunce, a boutique design and development company. “Installing central air conditioning is one of the biggest dilemmas I face in restoration.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“The majority of locations that use window and wall AC units don’t use them 12 months out of the year, they only use them during the peak hours in the summertime,” said Dickerson. “So the marketplace hasn’t placed pressure for the innovation of window and wall-based AC units.”  
&gt;  
&gt;One thing’s for sure: New York’s summer cityscape will continue to be dotted with window air conditioners for years to come.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/26/ac-units-central-air-summer-window-new-york-america.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/26/ac-units-central-air-summer-window-new-york-america.html)

I didn't say it was speculation that there is risk from air conditioning systems. I said it's speculation that you would attribute the entirety of a city's COVID numbers to be based on a tertiary mode of transmission without considering the context or balancing the studies versus what the more probabilistic causes are in practicality.

That is the WHO. But the WHO cannot force countries to act. China informed the WHO in early January. Countries like Korea took it seriously, where as countries like the US did not. 

&gt; We need to shut down the airports to any country experiencing a pandemic. Only controlled flights out with quarantined travelers.

This is problematic because a lot of the flights are for foreigners leaving that country. Take Wuhan for example. Chinese citizens need a visa to go to Europe and America, suggesting that most of the people who were flying out of Wuhan are not Chinese citizens, since you cannot just get a visa instantly. So how would it work for a country to forbid citizens from other countries from leaving a hotspot? Isn't that holding them hostage?

A quick google search will give you more articles than you’ll read about how well dogs can smell, how they actually smell, and how actuate their noses are. 

From what I’ve studied at school though about canine noses the wetness of their noses help trap more scent and the small slits in their noses help to make a circulation of air similar to an air purifier which helps bring in a larger volume sample of air. Combine that with the insane amount of “smell receptors” and decades of breeding for scent work and you got an animal that can do amazing things such as sniffing out viruses.

It's not just about money, many of the most vulnerable elderly people can't take care of themselves and need assistance from younger people.

Other vaccines need to be stored in very cold environments to remain effective. That means we would need to spend a great deal of infrastructure to store, ship, and distribute those vaccines. This vaccine can be stores, shipped, and distributed through infrastructure we already have - rather than building a super-cold warehouse to store them or a similar truck to ship them, we can use already-refrigerated warehouses and trucks. This is a huge upside. And because it’s one shot rather than two, the doses we would need to manage would literally be halved. All in all this greatly reduces the economic impact of distributing a vaccine, which is a huge upside.

The lower required dosages also means that production will be quicker, and that more doses can be made in a similar period of time than other vaccines. This means that if things look promising two-three months from now, J&amp;J can start doing some serious stockpiling.


Long story short, if this vaccine proves safe and effective, it’ll an absolute game changer.

No, there are four vaccine candidates from China currently in phase 3 trial in various countries. Some of those have been approved for emergency use in various countries including China itself, but none of them are yet approved for full scale mass deployment because phase 3 trial results are not yet available.

&gt;It's odd that China has the same time line for when the usa vaccine is supposed to come out.

No it's not, Ad5-nCoV, the adenovirus vector vaccine that CanSino is running at for example. The lab that came up with it relocated from Beijing into Wuhan on 26/01/2020 to be closer to the action, 3 days after Wuhan lockdown. What were other countries doing on 26/01/2020? Were they working on vaccines?

&gt;But, why does china need a vaccine if they controlled the outbreak so well that their is zero infections in all of china?

Because once a vaccine is available the border control measures will then be no longer required?

Because when they started working on a vaccine there was a full blown outbreak in China?

Because having a working vaccine allows it to be used for political capital?

1) baning nursing home visits since March

2) schools and universities out for the summer

3) people leaving cities to vacation at summer homes in isolated more areas. 

4) 98% of the population changed their behavior voluntarily to protect themselves from covid

6) baning large gatherings


""There is often quite a misconception about what has been done and what is being done in sweden"" said Christian Althaus, an epidemiologist at the University of Bern. 

And to address your second bullet point - infection rates being higher than originally expected were found from antibody testing. Antibody testing can tell if someone was asymptomatic with covid that otherwise would not self-report or otherwise be tested. Antibody testing is still significantly lower than 67%

The case number going down now is not only explained by herd immunity. Cases are significantly down in NY, does that mean the lockdown worked?  Cases are lower in the US overall than several weeks ago - do you think that's attributed to herd immunity?

California has nearly half the death rate (388) of Florida (634) and is well beneath Texas (534) and the national average (624).

New York has the second highest in the country.  It is also the urban epicenter of the US as one of the most densely populated regions in the entire country and due to it being an international hub of trade, business and travel was hit hardest at the onset of the pandemic when the US Federal government played down the virus (his words, on tape) and failed to prepare the nation to combat the spread of the virus.

The US began re opening from lock down around June 6th.

On this day New York had 30,997 deaths from the corona virus.

As of September 23rd, they have 33,188 deaths and a .9% positivity rate in testing.

To be clear, that's less than 1%.

Since New York started to safely re open they have only had a 7% increase in deaths.

California had 4,624 deaths on June 6th.  Now, 15,195.

They currently have a 2.8% positivity rate.

Cali has seen a 228% increase in deaths.

Florida.  June 6th: 2,691 deaths. Now: 13,623.

Positive tests: 11.2%.

Oh shit.  I miss spoke.  Florida has seen a 406% increase in deaths during the last four months after witnessing what this virus can do in states like New York.

Onto Texas!

On June 6th, Texas had 2,072 dead from COVID.  Now, 15,491.

Positivity rate: 10.2%.

Holy shit.  I guess everything is bigger in Texas.

647% increase.

But by March China had a lockdown on hundreds of millions of people, built 2 new hospitals. Put everyone with a positive test in immediate isolation, separating families. They had also sent 30000 doctors and nurses from all over the country to help the region in and around Wuhan.

It was described as ""draconian"" by European media, China took it very seriously, but we simply ignored that.

The WHO told several times that the situation is severe, that now is the time to act. They did not yet call it a pandemic because they were hoping that the virus could be stopped as China and Korea and Japan had shown was possible.

It was confusing how little European governments did to prepare and how lax the rules and contact tracing was.

Then we saw again what happened in Italy, videos of hospitals overflowing, doctors desperate. Nurses with blisters on their faces!

But our government said: no reason to cancel your skiing trips to Italy, go ahead! And when you return, no reason to isolate or even test everyone returning.

The only blame with the WHO I can find is that they did not encourage mask wearing for everyone because there was a lack of masks. 

Only the first three weeks in Januari was it not clear how the virus was spreading and how deadly it was, which is normal for a new virus. After that we wasted every opportunity to stop the virus and we still aren't handling it as we should.

The WHO recently said that they expect only 20% of people worldwide will be vaccinated by the end of 2021.

I was not aware. Italy is still in a state of emergency while Spain lifted theirs due to pressure from opposition parties in June. They didn't open nightclubs I believe (something NY didn't do either which might explain why they're doing much better than say Madrid).

Yes, there are morons like everywhere else but mask use isn't really part of the political debate.

Also sometimes the choice came down to lesser of two evils. So the candidate that leaned slightly towards the policies I cared about got the nod, even if both were, in my opinion, awful. 

Also, as I said above, since both D and R share a lot of similarities in policies, *to me they are the same.* Yes there are differences, but not in the areas I care about.

One of my most important positions is fiscal conservatism. But the last fiscally conservative president we had was Clinton. When neither candidate appears to be fiscally conservative, one of my next most important qualifications is social programs. If we're gonna blow money, I'd rather see it go towards the people, not corporations. Another important quality for me is avoiding unnecessary war. Bush went to war so he lost any chance of my vote on the 2nd term. Obama promised to fix it but he didn't, so he lost my vote too. Ron Paul *seemed* to be fiscally conservative, seemed to want to end the wars overseas, and he believe in non intervention of states rights. So while I am pro abortion I wouldn't be against states becoming more diverse and having different laws, like allowing some states to have abortion be illegal. I believe this diversity, while being negative in some regards would be positive in other regards. I believe we could learn from positive outcomes to improve other states. I hated both candidates in 2016 and I wanted to vote for the person I thought was the best, even though he was no longer running. This year I hate Trump but I see Biden as near equal *in the issues I care about.* So I'd rather have 4 years of Trump and be done with it than risk potential 8 years of Biden. Further is my concern of age of Biden, and his mental health. I don't expect him to die but I wouldn't be surprised if he did. And I think Kamala Harris would make a horrible president. The last time I was happy with a president was Clinton.

I think a lot of people were unaware of how bad the management was in some regards. The measures outlined here - that the management didn't even try to separate sick from healthy residents - are one of the example. FHM didn't write explicit recommendations for this to be done because it is one of the first thing health care professionals would do when dealing with infectious disease spread. Only after reports started coming out that some nursing homes were in fact using the ""lack of recommendation"" as an excuse that they don't have to do this that they issued official document.

It also puts former flu pandemics in very dark light.

- Herd Immunity is not a black and white threshold over which you have nearly zero cases. The more people around that are immune, the harder it becomes for the virus to spread. It is not a wild strategy that can be ""refuted"", it is a factual law of nature such as gravity.

- case count is a quite irrelevant metric because the data is inconsistent, known to be garbage and tell us very little. It is not possible to compare cases right now with cases earlier on because the volume of testing, and the profile of people tested changed absurdly. There is no sign there is more people infected right now than ever. Even when there are, when so many of the cases are mild or even completely unnoticeable without a test, this is an information that means nothing for our reality and to healthcare services. We didn't go around trying to count every swine flu case possible, or how many people catch the flu every season.

This metric should be completely abandoned in favour of more objective measures and that tell us more, such as positivity rate, hospitalizations and the proportion of cases that are serious.

There is not the degree of funding and eagerness of volunteers to participate that we are seeing now. It takes a long time to enroll people in your average clinical trial. Do you know why phase 3 trials typically take so long? Because you need to prove efficacy and to do that, you need people to get infected. If you are trying to prove efficacy of an HPV vaccine, it may take a long time for your volunteers to be exposed to HPV to get a statistically significant difference between the placebo group and vaccinated group. That is not a problem with COVID - the virus is running rampant. I understand that you have an intuition on how this will play out, but as I suggested in my last post, there is a sub full of scientists and doctors who are not influenced by politics at all that are sharing opinions and insights regarding vaccines, possible treatments, etc. I think that is more valuable than a video game that takes place in a virtual world. On your 6th point, there are countries that currently require certain vaccinations to enter and you show your travel vaccination card at customs. I wouldn't be surprised if that becomes a thing in 2021 with COVID vaccines. I am not calling you irresponsible or other names, but I will point out that your 1st point sounds dangerously similar to the people who say ""you can do whatever you want, but it is my freedom not to wear a mask"". We all need to work together to get out of this mess and between one side saying they won't wear a mask and the other side saying they won't get a vaccine under this admin., the US is going to have many dark days ahead.

[],,porlos67,,,[],,,,text,t2_149fn6,False,True,[],"**Professor Drosten, Professor Ganten, what was the biggest surprise for you with regard to COVID-19?**
 
CHRISTIAN DROSTEN: I didn't expect this virus to be so easily transmitted. It quickly became clear to me that it was a SARS virus, specifically the species, the same type of virus that I've known for 17 years. But I wouldn't have thought that this would behave so completely differently. Incidentally, this is due to a tiny detail in the surface protein of the virus.
 
DETLEV GANTEN: For me the biggest surprise was right at the beginning, when the virus was still far away. Suddenly the rapid spread started - these were not isolated cases but clusters. I would not have thought that the virus would spread so quickly and that the systems were so overwhelmed with all the catastrophic consequences. After all, we had severe flu waves, but they were all controllable.
 
**What is the most important thing in the fight against COVID 19?**
 
GANTEN: Clearly: transparency, cooperation, communication and: education! It is crucial that the population is well and clearly informed so that precautionary measures are understood and followed and myths are not spread. ""Education is the best vaccination"" - Education is the best vaccination. An educated society can deal better with such things, including false reports. I think that the educational infrastructures in Germany are so unmodern is a huge disaster. Worse than the fact that health departments have been neglected in the past.
 
DROSTEN: Things have to change in science too: In Germany, for example, medical research is very cancer-oriented. Infectious diseases are extremely important in medicine, and we are not only noticing this now. We need a lot more research there. Antibiotic resistance is the next big issue. This also applies to us in high-performance medicine. We see how it takes revenge if you neglect fields of activity that do not seem to affect us. But really only apparently.
 
**How can we get COVID-19 under control in the countries of the global south?**
 
DROSTEN: From our western perspective, one would say we need a vaccination. But that's not so easy when you think of the global south. The clock is ticking. The spread in such countries is not slow. And we have no idea how many people are infected there. However, there appear to be relatively few deaths in African countries. There may be obvious reasons for this. Firstly, the age profile: the population is simply younger. On the other hand, the immune system is used to many infections. Worm infections, for example, are universal there. They affect the immune system. We do not know the exact effect on this specific COVID-19 virus disease, but it could be an explanation.
 
**Germany currently holds the EU Presidency - what role can Germany and Europe play in fighting the global pandemic?**
 
GANTEN: In the current situation, in the increasingly bipolar world with the blocs USA and China, Europe has a decisive role to play. The most important thing is international, multilateral cooperation, especially with countries that have not always shown themselves to be cooperative in the past.
 
**So what is the key to improving global health care?**
 
GANTEN: Viruses and other human health threats know no national borders. Therefore: International structures must be strengthened. We can only act together - with courage, good ideas and across all borders. This also applies to science.
 
**How can we ensure that everyone in the world has access to a vaccine?**
 
DROSTEN: You have to use existing structures: There are international organizations and programs that have experience in supplying countries in the global south.
 
GANTEN: And the WHO has to be strengthened. Incidentally, Europe and Germany are doing this in an exemplary manner. And I think something else is important: international, moral pressure from science. The academies of science, which advise their respective governments and are heard in public, are particularly good at this. If individual countries then do not participate, they will not be able to withstand public pressure in the end.
 
**Do you think that more people will listen to science in the future?**
 
DROSTEN: The credibility of science is currently high, but that can change quickly. At the moment nobody knows exactly how the epidemic will play out. There is the possibility that the whole thing can no longer be controlled so well despite scientific explanation and that science, for example with the availability of vaccines, has simply been too slow. We won't know how science fared until the end. Because this pandemic is not a scientific phenomenon, it is a natural disaster.
 
GANTEN: Science is asked if it is credible. It must therefore keep an eye on the whole process holistically, i.e. as a whole, and also in an interdisciplinary manner: that is, in addition to the virological, for example also the economic, social and political aspects of a pandemic. Nobody can predict with precision what will happen. Science must approach problems critically and also self-critically. And then communicate it that way. Christian Drosten does this in an exemplary manner.
 
**What is the most important lesson we can learn for the future?**
 
DROSTEN: The pandemic is only just getting started. Also with us. At most we can speak of lessons from the first wave in Europe. There are huge differences here alone. But what one can say in any case is that it is relatively important to inform the population well and comprehensively. It can be very damaging when politicians use the dynamics of a pandemic for political messages. It's very difficult - the virus serves the bill immediately. You can see what that does in the USA. We are also seeing the consequences in Germany.
 
GANTEN: The message for me is very clear: health is the most important thing for the individual and it is the basis for a functioning society. Economy, culture and all of that no longer work when what we consider guaranteed is no longer there. I'm not sure everyone is really aware of this.
 
DROSTEN: I don't think so.
 
**If you had any wishes - what would they be?**
 
DROSTEN: In order to control the situation in the coming months, we have to change things. We need pragmatic decisions. There are already festive speeches about the German success, but it is not quite clear where it came from. This success was simply because we reacted about four weeks earlier than other countries. We responded by exactly the same means as others. We haven't done anything particularly well. We only did it earlier. That's why we were successful. We were not successful because our health departments were better than the French, or because our hospitals were better equipped than the Italians. If you now carry this over to autumn, then of course you have to realize that we will not continue to do anything better than others.
 
**This means?**
 
DROSTEN: In Argentina, for example, the spread is very difficult to control despite measures - it is winter there. In Germany we should take a much more differentiated and closer look abroad. We have to stop talking about things like football stadiums. This is really completely misleading.
 
GANTEN :: Of course I would like an effective therapy and a vaccine.
But I also find it very important that it finally becomes clear how vital international and multilateral cooperation is. And I repeat: education, education, education. An educated society understands the necessary measures, behaves sensibly, and does not run into pied peoples.
 
**When can you say we made it and can shake hands again?**
 
DROSTEN: What does ""you made it"" mean? Probably if the spread has broken through an epidemic pattern. So when there is no longer a free wave of infections running across the population, but only local outbreaks that can be controlled. This situation will be achieved in different countries at different times. In countries in the global south this could be the case earlier because the age structure is different. With us, of course, it depends on when there are enough vaccines for the risk groups.
 
**So priority on risk groups?**
 
DROSTEN: Yes, then we don't need 50 million vaccine doses in Germany. In addition to the expected distribution competence, it is also not that easy to fill so many vaccine doses into bottles and then inoculate them. Even if the vaccine is there. That's why this is already an undertaking for the whole of 2021. Even if one or two approved vaccines are available in January, everything has to be bottled and vaccinated.
 
GANTEN: A huge step forward would indeed be a vaccine and an effective therapy. But one thing must not be forgotten: the other diseases are still there, the many avoidable deaths, for example from cardiovascular diseases or infectious diseases, which cannot be controlled when antibiotics no longer work. I hope that, as a lesson from this Covid-19 pandemic, we will be better prepared for challenges of this kind in the future.

So these questions arise and buzzwords get thrown around, like 'herd immunity'  'vaccine' and 'cause of death.' In reality I'm just looking at this: 200k+ people are dead because of a virus. I don't work in a medical field, I don't personally see it.

But why would you think that inflating hospital numbers would change the ifr?  The only things that change ifr (infection fatality rate) is number of infections or number of deaths.  I'm confused as well that your saying the mutation makes it less lethal.  I'm saying that for the numbers to be correct it must be more lethal.  (or there needs to be many more infections than estimated, in which case this article is incorrect)

So if ifr is .33% and we have 1 death...then we must have around 300 infections.  If ifr is 1% and we have 1 death...then we must have around 100 infections.

So if we have .33 ifr (ala the cdc) then we have 61,979,400 infections.  But 61,979,400 is not 10% of the us population.  Yet the cdc is saying 90% still not infected.

We never did this shit. It's just American media on both sides that keeps lying about the actual situation in Sweden because this pandemic decided to happen during an election year in the US. We did as many restrictions as we needed to control the spread, and we did control it. We also did fuck up when it comes to Stockholm's elderly homes and we did straight up admit to that and it's currently under investigation. We might not have imposed full blown lockdowns but that's because our social safety nets and workers rights made it so that we didn't really need to. 

As soon as the pandemic started we increased the limit on paid sick leave without a doctor's notice from 1 week to 3 weeks and starting from the first day instead of the second, and everyone with even the slightest symptoms were told to stay at home on sick leave. Obviously the government stepped in to pay for the difference in that sick leave when it normally would be the employer. This also extends to sick children, if a child is sick then both parents get paid leave to stay at home with them. Everyone that can work remotely immediately switched to that, and most of those are still working remotely today.

The Swedish strategy has been very clear from the beginning when it was announced. The reasoning was very direct: Community spread has already started and contact tracing is no longer viable. That's why we need to implement measures that we can sustain over a long period of time rather than extreme measures that can cause severe side effects like anxiety, distrust and hostility towards government agencies, and young children missing out on education. This is why to this day we still have the same restrictions that we implemented back in March. You still aren't allowed to serve drinks at the bar counter. You still need to maintain a certain distance between tables at restaurants. Gathering of over 50 people are still prohibited. Consistency is the key to the strategy, and besides the fuck up in Stockholm's elderly homes, it clearly worked.

In the 1950s, Albert Sabin was searching for an improved polio vaccine. To that end, his lab infected the brains of mice, chimpanzees, and monkeys with the virus that causes the disease. They wanted to see if the pathogen would change and if weakened forms might arise.

They eventually isolated versions of the polio virus that could still infect people but didn’t cause paralysis. Sabin’s so-called attenuated strains became the famous oral polio vaccine given on a sugar cube to billions of children.

An example of a failure is California, they have tried controlling the spread for many months now yet completely failed to reach similar results as New York or even the less hard hit parts of Europe. They shouldn't look at New York for guidance on how to control it since New York is already lost, what they do now is meaningless, instead look at Finland, Denmark or Norway and see what they do, and you'd see that they have done things significantly different from New York.

But licensed doctors literally cannot work outside of the larger medical system they find themselves in, yet you blame them for being a part of it in the first place. Their two options are to take the high road and forgo being a medical professional altogether, leaving people to needlessly suffer when they have the ability to help, or to make changes from within the system as they're able. My dad is NOT unique in this regard -- there are volunteer clinics (including one local that he and MANY colleagues from across the specialties assist at) where doctors who might otherwise be booked solid work for free for those in need; psychologists and other practitioners who use sliding scales; Medecins sans Frontiers, and of course getting involved in hospital governance to enact systematic changes, as well as educating patients on how to advocate for themselves with insurance companies, find coupons for pharmaceuticals, etc.   

My purpose in replying was not to brag about my dad or glorify doctors as all being angels or whatever, but to show you that they aren't in ignorance of the inequity of healthcare (because they have a front row seat), and that they aren't consciously trying to exploit that by doing their due diligence and running ""some test""; recommending surgery when they don't believe it is in your best interest but will fatten their paycheck; nor ""walking away"" from those in need. Your anger is not unfounded whatsoever, but all I wanted to express is that directing that anger at doctors and nurses themselves is misplaced.

Their calculation of specificity, sensitivity and accuracy seems legit. 

What jumps out at me, however, is the fact that they were only able to obtain samples from just *[14 patients, seven positive and seven negative (.xlsx)](https://zenodo.org/record/3950074/files/Data%20file%201.xlsx?download=1)*.

Now, I'm no expert, but how do we know the dogs didn't just learn to sniff out characteristics of the 14 individuals present in their samples *other than the presence or absence of covid-19*. 

If you showed me portraits of the same 14 people ten thousand times and gave me a reward every time I picked the positive one I could probably get close to 100% accuracy, too. That doesn't mean I can spot COVID by looking at your face.

&gt;As the authorities of the Ministry of Health had well warned, the opening of the blocks and the change in mobility measures could open the door to possible outbreaks, especially when last weekend the streets, avenues, coastal strip and road of Amador were packed with people, and in Panama there are 5 new cases due to regrowth, and it is expected that if they do not comply with the government's provisions, they may increase.

&gt;Given this, the Minsa, together with the Gorgas, is studying using a saliva test to detect covid-19, and another for breath that could be acquired in Israel.

&gt;The Minister of Health explained that the thesis is that the covid-19 virus was reactivated in the person. Another possibility is that the virus has not completely dropped and is reactivated again, and a third is that of a reinfection by the same virus or by a virus that has mutated. The first cases of reinfection by the new coronavirus in Hong Kong, the Netherlands and Belgium, scientifically proven.

&gt;Panama is in negotiations with Israel to analyze the acquisition of another method to detect the virus, which would be through breath, and the result is ""quite fast.""

&gt;Sucre explained that initially only the person with the symptoms was swabbed and then the contacts. “Our strategy has been to swab all the contacts. At the international level, it is said that 30% of infections could be asymptomatic people. That means that they release the virus and can infect, ”said the head of Health.

&gt;To control that 30%, sweeps are being carried out to prevent the spread of covid-19.

&gt;Panama has yet to discuss the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine, as recommended by doctors from the Santo Tomas hospital, but the Health Minister hopes to hear the opinion of the specialists. “I don't want to get ahead of myself, but at this moment every element that is found there are people who are for and against. As a health authority we must seek the best for the population.

&gt;Panama belongs to the Covax facility program that seeks to guarantee rapid, fair and equitable access to vaccines against covid-19, and for that $ 20 million was reserved.

I keep pounding these two questions. What could we have done better? How do we prevent this from happening again? We need a permanent pandemic response department. We need to shut down the airports to any country experiencing a pandemic. Only controlled flights out with quarantined travelers. Internally made PPE is a necessity. A national response - otherwise it's just wack-a-mole.

* Patients in ICU are 18 - has been the same figure for few days now.

**Please, remember there is lag in reporting and deaths reported on a certain day are usually mostly deaths that happened on previous days. On average it takes up to 11 days to report 90% of the deaths for a certain day (see in the links graphs about how that looks)**

I mean it's not like the Trump administration is performing great. Look @ the recent Hague report condemning Trump for sanctioning the  International Criminal Court.

https://www.hrw.org/topic/international-justice/international-criminal-court

Who does that? Criminals who are violating international standards for human rights

&gt;The ICC represents and constitutes part of a global system of international justice of which the United States was a chief architect at Nuremberg and beyond. Today, the ICC, alongside other tribunals, regional mechanisms, and national courts, is carrying forward these efforts through investigations and prosecutions that could help realize justice for atrocity victims from Sudan to Myanmar. As a court of last resort, the ICC only can intervene when and where a State has demonstrated unwillingness or inability to hold its nationals to account for crimes within the Court’s jurisdiction. The ICC therefore provides an essential backstop for victims who have no other recourse to justice. The use of sanctions has the potential for wide-reaching impact against this institution dedicated to advancing justice for victims.

The wide confidence interval 41,660–117,419 reflects considerable uncertainty in this estimate. Dividing the number of deaths with the number of infections gives an **IFR estimate of 0.58%**

Research with 50,027 volunteers in China shows that the Coronavac vaccine did not show significant adverse reactions

Among people over 60 (422 volunteers), the results showed 97% effectiveness

In Brazil, the vaccine was applied to almost 5,600 volunteers with no record of serious adverse reaction

Governor João Doria announced on Wednesday (23) the results of a survey of 50,027 volunteers in China demonstrating that the Coronavac vaccine, developed by the Butantan Institute in partnership with the Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac Life Science, is safe and has had no significant adverse reactions . Of the total volunteers, 94.7% had no adverse reaction. Another 5.36% experienced low-grade adverse effects, such as pain at the application site, moderate fever and loss of appetite.

""These results prove that Coronavac has an excellent safety profile and also prove the manifestation made by the World Health Organization two weeks ago indicating Coronavac as one of the eight most promising vaccines under development in its final stage worldwide,"" he said Doria.

Testing in children and the elderly began in China. Among people over 60, the vaccine was applied to 422 volunteers and the results showed 97% effectiveness. Child studies have 552 volunteers aged 3 to 17 years.

“Safety and efficacy are two of the main factors in proving whether a vaccine is ready for emergency use in the population. We are very optimistic about the results that Coronavac has presented so far. This shows that Butantan and Sinovac are on the right path for the production of an immunizer against the coronavirus ”, explained the Director of the Butantan Institute, Dimas Covas.

The clinical studies that have been carried out in Brazil since the 21st of July have already applied the vaccine to almost 5,600 volunteers, with no record of serious adverse reaction. They are monitored by the 12 Research Centers spread over 5 Brazilian states plus the Federal District.

Coronavac doses

By December, the Butantan Institute will receive 46 million doses of Coronavac, with 6 million doses of the vaccine ready for application. Another 15 million doses are expected to arrive by February 2021.

The vaccine developed by Sinovac Life Science is one of the most promising in the world because it uses technology already known and widely applied in other vaccines by the Butantan Institute.",,,1600913082,{},g6dnm9b,True,t3_iyo1eb,False,False,t3_iyo1eb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iyo1eb/study_of_over_50000_volunteers_in_china_shows/g6dnm9b/,1600916807,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

And by the way, if mask is not actually sealed air tight to the face, ie see that gap between the mask and the face? Air still can get through that gap letting in the virus.

AND - virus from what I've heard can infect through the eyes too. Which by the way, just as an immediate suggestion, should wear something like swimming goggles to prevent contaminated air from getting to the eyes.

So, at the very least duct tape the edges of the mask to the face, mask needs to be a good filter by the way, and swimming goggles.

However, should probably look towards better things than just a mask and goggles - a full head cover, that seals air tight, or better yet a fully enclosed suit. If don't have something at least like a head cover should make DIY out of garbage bags or something can wear - garbage bags, form to shape around the head, cut a hole to see out of, cover and seal said hole with some clear plastic like from lunch bags, cut a hole near the mouth and place some HEPA filter fabric over that area or something better -- and once have that head cover, need to make sure actually seal AIR TIGHT only letting in filtered air, so for example put head cover over head and get some duct tape to attach the lower part to the neck or so.

It is just too dangerous and a big hassle to deal with taking completely avoidable risks - and completely unnecessary to begin with. Just wait till a vaccine - seems there's some talk of already mass producing vaccines at this very moment.

Sitting in an interior, virus just saturated all over the place, floating in the air like dust. Gets in your hair, clothes, and if just wearing a simple mask that's not actually sealed air tight, no eye protection - virus eventually just seeps around that gap in the mask and falls on the eyes infecting you. And even if wearing stuff like goggles and a sealed mask - if don't actually clean yourself BEFORE getting inside home, then are just tracking in the virus inside, virus still in the hair and clothes, all over the body - easily lead to cross contamination! Ie virus falls off clothes and like dust just starts floating in the air and breathe that in, laying down and virus falls of hair and perhaps eventually works its way in the nose, breathing it in that way -- just too much of a hassle to deal with!",,,1600962907,{},g6fpbst,False,t3_iyvf7h,False,True,t3_iyvf7h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iyvf7h/mark_wahlberg_donates_13_million_face_masks_to_us/g6fpbst/,1600963893,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I took that to mean 80% is the herd immunity level for any virus (I assume the R number being different for different viruses just changes how quickly you get to that 80%, it doesn't reduce or increase the 80%). Then he said that depending on the virus some percentage are asymptomatic so the final figure for herd immunity would be 80% less whatever percentage are asymptomatic (so you never notice them)

Last I heard was that 30% are asymptomatic for Coronavirus, so 80% less 30% of 80% leaves 56% of the population to get Coronavirus (and have some kind of illness ranging from mild to death) before herd immunity is achieved.

Sweden's obesity rate: 18.6%

Sweden's diabetes rate: 4.8%

Sweden's coronary heart disease deaths: 58.27 per 100,000. Ranking #162 in the world.

Now for the USA-

USA population density: 94 per square mile. 46% higher than Sweden. 

Florida's population density: 397.2 per square mile. 6.2 times higher than Sweden. 

USA obesity rate 39.8%. over twice as high as Sweden.

USA diabetes rate: 10.5%. over twice as high as Sweden's.

USA coronary heart disease deaths: 79.2 per 100,000. Rank #139 in the world.

Fauci says there will be widespread vaccines starting to be available around April. This should mean that class of 2021 should have a proper graduation ceremony, right? Many universities are planning a late start in late January or early February for hybrid in person and online classes but with an overall return to classes and no spring break whatsoever. 

Some universities, like in California, have already decided on fully online classes in the spring. To me this makes no sense because it seems too early to make a decision. They seem to be relying on case forecasts which have proven to be quite inaccurate. There are many students like myself who feel scammed by online classes since we really aren’t learning anything at all and everyone is basically cheating on their exams. I have also been deprived completely of social interaction because of online classes and it’s taking a massive toll on my mental health, yet I am still paying thousands of dollars. My university hasn’t made an announcement yet on what spring will look like but I don’t see why we can’t have a late start with some restrictions like limiting class sizes and having a mask mandate. This will be my last semester too so I’m particularly heartbroken at the thought of continuing like this.

Personally I am crossing my fingers for my university to shift from online to hybrid—I’m not expecting a fully in person plan (I go to school in a big city) and I don’t mind wearing a mask.

Top donors could even get little cameos, even on cgi only shows (like a 21st century version of [Reboot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReBoot)). Lower teirs could get various levels of merch etc.

Restaurants are notorious high-risk, high-failure-rate businesses. Having an interest, desire, and even culinary skill isn’t sufficient to ensure profitability/longevity.

All businesses eventually stop; and part of ownership is knowing when to get in and get out of certain sectors; or how to adapt to the changing marketplace/regulatory environment.

I asked if I could put new surgical gloves on afterwards and the answer was no, despite pointing out that they were not latex. The hospital also wouldn't give me a pair of their own.

Next, you're in a crowded elevator, stopping at every floor, and trying to do everything possible to not touch my face. My doctor's waiting room was filled with people coughing. Every time I breathed out with the paper mask, my glasses fogged up.

[],,some_dumb_mutha,,,[],,,,text,t2_2kc9c51f,False,False,[],"There have been exactly 66 deaths due to COVID of children under 15 in the US in 2020. If you raise the age to 24 (the next available breakpoint in the data), that goes up to a whopping 419 deaths. **Four Hundred Nineteen deaths under age 24.**

Looking on a percentage basis... COVID is responsible for 0.2% of deaths under 1 year of age so far in 2020 (20 out of 11,313 deaths); 0.7% of deaths from 1-4 years (15 out of 2,158); 0.9% of deaths from 4-14 years (31 out of 3,356); and 1.6% of deaths from 15 to 24 years (353 COVID deaths out of 21,615 total deaths).

What causes similar levels of fatality? Well, for under 1 years old, the chart I found only lists the Top 10 causes... #10 is ""Neonatal Hemorrhage"" and caused 375 deaths in 2018 (versus 20 COVID deaths so far in 2020). For children from 1-4 years old, again the chart only lists 10 and #10 is ""Cerebrovascular"", and accounts for 43 deaths in 2018 (versus 15 for COVID so far in 2020). For kids 9-14, the #10 cause of death is ""Benign Neoplasms"", which was responsible for 49 deaths in 2018, versus 31 COVID deaths in 2020. Finally, for 15-24 year olds, we actually break into the Top 10... COVID would come in at the #6 cause of death for this age group, just behind ""Heart Disease"" at 905 deaths, and equal to ""Congenital Anomalies"" at 354.

If you are under 24 and worried about dying from COVID, then you need to understand that it's very low on the list of likely deaths you're facing.  I really don't understand why this isn't more widely reported by the media.

I think the only reason you have to say this is that you think it'll annoy me, because that notion doesn't relate to my last comment.

&gt;Having to resort to calling me a “piece of schit” shows that you cannot carry on reasonable discourse.

Did I *have to*? That'd be a hard sell. I'd ask you to explain that, but you'd refuse on that also. But that's just an excuse, anyway. You know you can't explain the ""social contract"". You didn't carry on reasonable discourse at *all*, which means that I surpassed you there. 

When someone's ego is attached to rationality and accuracy, the size of it isn't a problem. When someone's ego is attached to desire not to have to reconsider any prior belief, it *is* a problem. When did you determine that you were from that point on right about everything and that you would never question yourself?

If you ever have anger towards people who lie in public and alter the course of social events, look in the mirror.

If you read comments like mine and don't think that your consideration of the subject is lacking in the extreme, then there's no hope for your mind.

[],,jbjbjb55555,,,[],,,,text,t2_173ocq,False,False,[],"Let us be very realistic. The COVID virus will NOT end in any near future. I have drawn some reasonable conclusions based on some understanding of viruses and epidemics. I will not be too technical as it hardly adds much to the appreciation of huge capability of nature.

Covid-19 is the disease caused by SARS-COV-2 virus. This virus has shown itself to be very contagious with short incubation period in humans. The pandemic however will end as you will be able to appreciate when you get some idea about the virus and some of its prominent properties. You will however continue to get sporadic outbreaks with possibly seasonal patterns.

You can not have reliable vaccine as in small pox and polio. The COVID is an RNA virus and likes to mutate quite comfortably. The worst of its aggression will tone down after taking the toll of hundreds of thousands of elderly and twisting the world economy like never before.  Humans would then learn to live with this virus like a nasty flu bug which will hit them every season. Those with comorbidities will continue to pay heavier price .

Let us now have a very brief glimpse of this virus. It was happily living in some exotic creatures and ended up unwittingly in a human host as humans are pretty much like cockroaches when it comes to food habits. It did not mean to be so aggressive and was happily living in the previous natural host. In the humans it found it easy to multiply and spread largely through contact. The preventive measure of social distance, masks and hand wash is related to this aspect.

Unfortunately this new host (human) found the virus more uncomfortable leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Some mutation perhaps took place and more would be in the pipeline.
This mutation can make it more aggressive or less aggressive. 

The second prospect is a preferable behaviour from the viewpoint of the parasite. There is no point being so vicious that you kill your host when you can not survive outside your prey. This is evolutionary and follows the rules of survival.

Vast majority of those infected will survive the infection and build some degree of immunity. Those who do not survive are largely elderly or those with some preexisting comorbidities. Perhaps classic survival of the fittest in its raw form.

The think tanks of Boris Johnson and Donald Trump considered that as a preferred option. They were hoping for some mortality over a long period and were prepared for this. The economic argument made sense. However the thinkers got one tiny aspect wrong. The virus turned out to be rather too aggressive with short incubation period taking serious toll on the senior citizens. 
Italy and Spain showed how crazy it could get, overwhelming the health service. UK and USA had to lock down. This is a bit late but better late than never.

The idea was that a gradual spread would take place, which allows the health service to cope with best of its facilities. This would go on for years and largely have serious effect on the elderly. In economic terms this is more acceptable.
The herd immunity would develop and we will benefit with one more variety of flu bug to choose! 

The Covid virus will not end but humans will learn to live with it by sacrificing those with reduced ability to fight while the majority of the rest develop some immunity. Every season we should expect a few thousands to depart their bodies for years to come due to their losing battle with SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Drugs and vaccines are long way off in terms of cure or prophylaxis. There are drugs that do help in recovery of clogged lungs but they do NOT kill the virus. It is the body's immune system that does the actual task of fighting the invader. Drugs are likely to help, only up to an extent, once available widely. Rapid mutations makes vaccines hard to be of great efficiency and hence to be of great use.
Poorer nations and those with fragile economies would otherwise pay a huge price.

The understanding of the world as we know, was made up of relentless pursuit of wealth regardless of the means. This will be questioned for a while. Expect things to go back as usual in a few years, followed by a plus version of COVID in due course!

It is not the end of the world though humans overestimate their ability and importance in the grand scheme of universe! Humans are totally expendable when nature decides it had enough.

Live with due respect with the nature and the odds are humans will lead a happier and healthier life and perhaps longer as well. This statement may have a spiritual or a philosophical leaning but that can easily be backed by some boring studies:)
We have silently watched nature being ravaged indiscriminately by humans. It is easy to be a bit cynical about humans who like to think they know best! Sadly the silent majority has to pay the price. The minority who make the noises are of little impact.

New research presented at this week's ESCMID Conference on Coronavirus Disease (ECCVID, online 23-25 September) confirms that men with COVID-19 have worse outcomes than women, possibly related to them experiencing higher levels of inflammation. The study is by Dr. Frank Hanses, University Hospital Regensburg, Germany, and colleagues, and shows that men have a 62% increased risk of COVID-19 associated death compared with women, after adjustment for various factors.

...

 While most laboratory parameters were comparable between male and female patients with COVID-19, men had significantly higher inflammatory markers (IL-6, CRP, PCT, ferritin) across all phases of disease 

...

The authors conclude: ""Men are more likely to progress to critical phases of COVID-19. Men have higher death rates as well as more frequent ICU admissions and longer hospital stays, that are all associated with higher inflammatory parameters during all phases of COVID-19. In our cohort, this effect was not explained by differences in comorbidities, age or BMI between male and [female patients](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/female+patients/).""

But wait theres more...According to The New York Times, potentially 90 percent of those who have tested positive for COVID-19 have such insignificant amounts of the virus present in their bodies that such individuals do not need to isolate nor are they candidates for contact tracing. Leading public health experts are now concerned that overtesting is responsible for misdiagnosing a huge number of people with harmless amounts of the virus in their systems.

Of that number, 202 were deemed as close contacts and were tested for the COVID-19 virus and antibodies, with all of the results coming back negative, the center said.

&gt; According to the CECC, 25 people who traveled from Taiwan to the Philippines over the past four months tested positive for COVID-19 on arrival, which is 0.48 percent of the total number of travelers on that route during that period.

&gt; In comparison, the percentage of positive cases among travelers from Taiwan to other countries in the four-month period was between 0.005 and 0.055 percent, the CECC said.

&gt; According to CECC spokesman Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥), efforts by the center to obtain more detailed information about the Philippine cases and the testing process there have drawn only ""vague responses.""

There's a narrative some people (hint: China) are trying to promote that Taiwan is hiding cases and avoiding testing.

I think we can all decide which is more likely:

- Taiwan has a pandemic the government is trying to hide. But people are not dying in hordes. Hospitals are not flooded. Collegues and neighbors are not disappearing.
- The virus somenow shuts down and only infect people without causing any symptoms when they enter Taiwanese borders, and then become active when they leave Taiwan.
- It's just the Philippines and Japan and other nations seeing the false positives (as can be seen from their extremely low percentage like 0.48% and 0.055% compared to total travelers from Taiwan) because quick tests used in large scale testing are known to have a relatively low accuracy.

A recent political manuver by the opposition party in Taiwan to secretly test 4841 high risk (quarantined people and front-line hospital workers) for antibodies only found 4 people testing positive, giving a rate of 0.00083, or 0.083%.

They wanted to prove that Taiwan has mass infections. Instead, they proved Taiwan is extremely safe and had virtually no infections even among those with high risk.

That's why psychology is different from sociology, or why chemical hydrology (the study of the chemical properties of water) is different from hydrometeorology (the study of transfer of water and energy between the land, oceans and the atmosphere).

&gt; If there’s not a piece of evidence in those handful of articles, go google for the info you’re interested in.

“Even poorly performing masks captured over 90% of viruses. The researchers chose two N95 masks that scored poorly in an earlier study, yet even these poor-performers still blocked 94% of particles under the heaviest air flow rate.

I just read a text post on a local Facebook group and was wondering if it was accurate as i dont know much about the virus. was wondering if someone who does can filter out any misinformation. TIA

post is as follows:  


On masks: sense and sensibilities 

There’s been plenty of discourse on masks especially on Glastonbury highstreet mainly being shouted by people you can smell before you can see, this is not for those people. They can't read. So this is a message to all those sensible analytical people who have found themselves anti-mask or for anyone who still complains (even internally) everytime they get on a bus or go to tesco. its difficult for most of us to inconvenience ourselves for some abstract old person who may have died anyway. We'd like to care, like to think we care but its not enough for us to make semi-permanent lifestyle changes. But lets be totally selfish for a moment and think about how masks might help us as individuals. I can see why the death count as a percentage of the population makes it look on the surface less like a pandemic and more like a colossal over reaction. But as usual its not the dead who have to worry, viral infections come in dizzying varieties and an initial infection can lead to complications down the line, for example, consider chicken pox and the initial infection, how you feel a little itchy and a little achy but after a week, your good to go. except you aren't really are you, because the virus can sit in your nervous system for years and years until one day BAM! shingles, now its a recovery period more than 4 times longer far more severe skin problems and often lethargy in excess. These later complications are a staple feature of viral infections and are heavily correlated with the initial viral load.

what this means for us with a (Relatively) unknown virus is that it could be years if not decades before the full extent of the damage is known (or it COULD be fine and everyone will get better) , there are a large number of people reporting symptoms not going away after recovering. This can be as minor as still missing your sense of smell or as major as chronic fatigue (ME) and other scary Neurological conditions.

my point being the implications of the virus are almost entirely unknowable especially to idiots like me with basically no medical knowledge to begin with, but also to people who actually work in medicine and biology. so unless you have some extra info for me it seems like limiting your viral load is going to greatly increase the chance you have a symptomless case and with that a much lower chance of Complications later on.

There is what i'd like to call a tendency but looking at it in terms of recent events i think the word is nowhere near strong enough to describe people's pathological need to never change their mind, to remain consistent and its literally killing people, dont let you socio-political hang-ups get in the way of good old fashioned informed decision making, let go of your righteous indignation it blinds you as effectively as plucking your eyes out. and more than anything else YOUR BELIEFS ARE NOT YOUR CHILDREN you and i are not experts in virology, we are going to be wrong we are going to make mistakes but clinging to a mistake is still just as much of a mistake.

We just dont know whats gonna happen yet Lads, safe not sorry yeah?

TL:DR

\- death is not the only and possibly not even the worse symptom of Covid

\- dont lick people with chickenpox

\-wear a mask, even a thin scarf is going to reduce the amount of any potential virus you come into contact with

\-just cus you've already decided your opinion doesn't mean you exempt from the possibility that you are just not correct on this one

And who, realistically, is saying ""my vote will be determined by if there's an EUA for a vaccine before election day"" because remember, the vax will be given to the elderly and infirm first, and it will take multiple months to be able to get them vaccinated in major areas around the USA. I don't understand being concerned about a vaccine being pushed by you know who when big pharma and reviewers at the FDA have way too much to lose by pushing out a vaccine that doesn't work or isn't safe just to simp for the prez. Imagine being the pharma company that releases a vaccine that doesn't work or is harmful to the people. This isn't me putting ""trust"" in them, it's more so that it's in their and FDA reviewer's best interest for themselves to put out something that works. Plus either way it will take until early next year for any doses to get to the general public, so if there are issues they will be put on absolute BLAST before they reach the average working age middle-lower class joe (who aren't health workers).

Because as you say, you cannot separate the ruthless businessman of 20 years ago from the philanthropist today. I completely agree with you.  In fact, I have a fundamental problems with anyone hoarding as much wealth as Bill Gates does (regardless of his philanthropy work). (I don't want to get too much into that debate, but I do recommend this [representation](https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/) of wealth skew)

I do however think he actually has done good work with his foundation. And I do not doubt that he genuinely cares about this particular issue. His earlier warnings for a global pandemic do lend credibility to him here. He's clearly knowledgeable on the topic of global pandemics and the effect it has on poorer communities in the world. Furthermore, the efforts they spend on securing vaccines as well for the entire world, not just the rich west, is to some sense still admirable. To put it simply, despite his problems Gates is a voice I listen to in this issue. (Not the only one, and neither do I say he's an authority on the issue, definitely not in the same sense as qualified epidemiologist)   


That being said, I really do not disagree with anything you say. Bill Gates is not a hero of mine, and neither should he truly be an example in my view (if I were to appoint tech heroes, I'd much rather say Linus Torvalds).

But I find the argument that the true rate in Sweden is (way) lower than the test rate to be problematic. For 2 reasons:

Most positive cases caught now in Denmark are asymptomatic (or caught early). Which given the test volume is hardly surprising. I think it's a fair assumption that true positivity and test positivity is pretty much the same here (0,7-1%). Which follows half your argument, more or less. 

But I disagree on the second half. Though less, 140.000 tests per week is still a fairly large test volume and I wouldn't call it a different strategy as such. I find it difficult to believe that this sample is biased to the point of invalidating my argument. I might over estimate the number as swedes may be more hesitant to get tested before feeling sick. I agree that we're ahead on the inclination to get tested. But not that much.  

But still, my expectation is that Sweden has a fair number of asymptomatic cases untested. People who are not feeling sick, probably younger people. In Denmark they have a higher chance of getting tested and enter the stats.

It will remain in circulation around the world forever, just like the cold virus. It may decrease in deadliness and virulence, and it certainly won't be as ""novel"" as it had been when it first made headlines at the beginning of the year - but it's not going away any time soon.

**As for the *state of emergency* and *disruption of daily life in general*; specifically, the safety measures associated with the pandemic (e.g. mask-wearing, social distancing, closures, cancellations)**: you might be wishing that they will no longer be necessary once a vaccine for COVID-19 is approved, which - *at least according to your opinion* - could happen within a matter of months. However, it's important for us to be realistic with our expectations, and to avoid accepting unsubstantiated beliefs and magical thinking just because they sound good (a common mistake I find in the reasoning of lockdown skeptics). And so, with bare facts and expert opinion in mind, I shall declare that *no, the vaccine is not the ""fairytale"" endgame you might have expected*, in the words of one expert on CNBC. So don't get your hopes up on that.

According to the commonly held consensus of pandemic professionals, we will need to maintain our current precautions for a while. Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC of the United States, forecasted that although emergency use authorizations might arrive before the end of this year (and even then, only under optimal circumstances), widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines would have to wait until summer 2021. Dr. Anthony Fauci, national epidemiologist of the United States, went even further and predicted that it won't be safe to return to pre-pandemic ""old normal"" until very late 2021 - *over a year from now*. Dr. Paul Offit, Philadelphia pediatrician and former vaccine developer, made some very bold claims about the vaccine timeline to MarketWatch, going as far as to say that Americans should continue to wear masks and socially distance for about a year, even *after* the vaccine makes its way into the hands of the general public; his reasoning was that since the vaccine was projected to be only 50-75% effective, there would still be a substantial proportion of the population vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection, and therefore it wouldn't be safe for Americans to let down their guard. These prediction are not just exclusive to the United States, either: Dr. Theresa Tam, the Canadian equivalent of Dr. Fauci, warned long ago that these measures would remain for *two to three years* following the approval of a vaccine.

Do I *like* these statements? Do they sound good? Do I wish they were true? ***No***. But do I believe them? Well, since these are *experts on public health*, I can't just ignore them, can I? Now, I am aware that this is a *very* unpopular opinion on r/Coronavirus, but I am not a *coward*, and I am confident enough to say that ***yes***, we *will* have to wear masks and socially distance for years to come. If I choose to remain in blissful ignorance of the harsh truth, I'm guilty of the same science denial that a lot of us accuse many politicians of dabbling in. **There's no way around it, and so the only choice I have - and the only choice *all of us* have - is to accept the facts, and find ways to adapt to the *new normal***.",,,1600949790,{},g6f00bo,False,t3_iyaiu2,False,True,t1_g6eg2yq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iyaiu2/daily_discussion_post_september_23_questions/g6f00bo/,1600949802,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Add in the incident today. 
(See Reddit post)

This is demonstrated behavior from Rand to try to ignore the science and discredit Dr. Fauci to add credibility to the false claims he’s making. To ignore the facts behind Dr. Fauci and say “if Rand interrupts enough listen to him” is not only encouraging this behavior but also just wrong. Dr. fauci says something Rand doesn’t like, (like how children can get and pass on Covid) and Rand says he doesn’t like that answer and just tries to ignore it.

The preschool has a policy, can't come in unless they have a negative covid test. I kept her home from preschool, cancelled our social obligations and I took her in to get tested for covid. She came back negative (90% accuracy). The pediatrician explained the other extremely common and rampant viruses are still out there. She had 3 patients that day come in with the same symptoms and also test negative.

Later my 10 month old popped a fever - no surprise, he's fucking teething. I know this because I know him. He pops a fever every night a tooth breaks through and he's working on his molars right now. But his allergist (anaphylaxis we're narrowing down with testing) wouldn't see him for 2 weeks regardless of any test results. Okay. So we ""quarantine"" him for let's count.. the 6th time? And his ANAPHYLAXIS that we don't know the cause of is on hold to find out. Don't even get me started on his epipen which took a full month to fulfill ""because of covid"". Does it get any more serious than anaphylaxis?

On the one hand, I get it. This is real and we're fighting it. I know I'm lucky to be in a position to take my kids out, keep them home. And we're lucky we're in a financial position with insurance where we can keep taking them in to get tested, otherwise we'd have to stay home with them.

But I also wonder at what point is taking our toddlers in to get tested actually more of a risk with exposure? The sniffles don't stop. My baby has a few more teeth to go, there will be more fevers. They don't have covid. To my knowledge none of us have.. but going into the testing center when you don't is a good way to get it. (They don't do drive by testing for the littles in my area. They have to do the less accurate shallow nasal swab according to our pediatrician because the deep nasal swab is ""deeply, deeply traumatic for very young children"". Which I get. They don't love being held down while someone does something painful to them that they don't understand. That creates fear of doctors, I get that).

I have a friend who's daughter has anxiety. It presents as stomach aches, which she deals with by frequently requesting to see the school nurse and asking to call her mom. Because of the varied symptoms of covid though, stomach ache = get a test or quarantine, per school policy.

As far as I've seen, there IS evidence that covid is capable of hanging in the air like that.

My primary source for this stuff is the Podcast [This Week in Virology](https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/), which is affiliated with the American Society for Microbiology, and hosted by top virologists in the US. 

There are two issues going on here:

1. The [false positive paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy)- a phenomenon where when the actual cases of a disease in a population is low, even an extremely accurate test will generate more false positives than true positives. For example, if a test is 99% accurate, but only 2% of the population is actually infected, then roughly half of all positive tests will actually be false positives. This is a problem currently in places like NYC where a very low percent of the population is actually infected. Luckily orthogonal testing methods can solve this problem (e.g. using two types of tests, or just testing a second time on people with positive test results). 

2. Perhaps the bigger problem when it comes to SARS-CoV2 detection is the concept of what is a positive. The current gold-standard RT-PCR tests are extremely sensitive, and can detect very small viral loads. This is great for diagnosis but not for screening. A person with a very small viral load is likely not contagious (either they have just recently been infected, or they have been infected for a long time). So a person can test positive for covid19, even when they are long past the infectious stage of the disease. If your aim is to screen people for whether or not they can infect someone else, then that is a false-positive. Another problem is that PCR tests take at least a day to give results, and often much more than that (my sister gets tested regularly for her job in NYC and it takes two weeks to get the results back- at which point they are completely meaningless). 

It's being argued by many epidemiologists and other scientists that a more effective way to control the pandemic is to use less sensitive but cheaper and rapid-acting tests. These tests are not as sensitive to small viral loads, but are accurate for when someone has enough virus in their body to actually be contagious. Therefore if, for example, you wanted to go to school, you could test yourself in the morning, get the result in 15 minutes, and if the test was negative you'd be reasonably sure that it was safe for you to go out. This requires frequent (~daily) testing to be effective.

There are two options: 

1) Take active measures to prevent the spread of a virus with the ultimate goal of eradicating it from the population.

2) Allow the spread to continue (slowed or not) until enough of the population have developed an immunity to the virus.

Sweden chose the second option. They expressly said that their goal was merely to *slow* the spread, without taking any measures designed to stop it. That is by default a ""herd immunity"" strategy.

New Zealand (for example) chose the first option. It took active measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 and as a result a nation with half the population of Sweden has had over 40 times fewer cases, and over 120 times fewer deaths.
