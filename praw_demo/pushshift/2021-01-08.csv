If you dig into the numbers, you'll see that the New York City death number on April 15 jumped by over 3500 compared to the seven day rolling average (including the 4585 in that rolling average). That's a huge increase, even for a city whose healthcare systems are overwhelmed. If the number were accurate, you'd expect to see a similar death number on at least a couple of days around April 15. Instead, the rolling average for the days around it are in the 500 to 1000 range. 

Since the number jumped so high on that one day, we can guess that the death number for that date includes other deaths. I went looking in the news archives, and sure enough...https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/nyregion/new-york-coronavirus-deaths.html

The tl;dr of the article is that the count in New York up to that date had only included people who actually tested positive. The health department had also been tallying deaths that were presumed to be from COVID due to history and symptoms, and those numbers were added as deaths on April 14 (which would be reported on April 15).

There are also days within ten days of that date, either way, where no deaths are reported in NYC. While I can't point to specific cases, I can say with some certainty that people died of COVID on NYC on those days but the deaths were reported on another day.

Currently, IHME projections are strongly influenced by trends in deaths and the relationship between infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. As has been indicated by multiple sources, we believe that the low reported death numbers are due to reporting delays and not due to real decreases in COVID-19 mortality. Past experience with reporting delays suggests that by next week the information provided should be more reliable and reflect catch-up reporting. Here are a few examples of data reported this week indicating that death reporting is significantly delayed.

Playgrounds, zoos and other recreational spaces have closed. Kids like Krissy have struggled to cope and the toll is becoming evident.

Actually, there is a variant in Northern Nevada that carries a unique mutation that is currently being studied.

[New COVID-19 mutation found in Nevada](https://www.fox5vegas.com/coronavirus/new-covid-19-mutation-found-in-nevada/article_5e938fd6-4426-11eb-a2a4-63a35ab0e118.html)

&gt;As the eyes of the world are monitoring a new and more infectious  mutation of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom, scientists in Nevada are  still trying to analyze a mutation found in Northern Nevada.  
&gt;  
&gt;The mutation is only one of several documented throughout the United States.  
&gt;  
&gt;Scientists at the University of Reno School of Medicine  and the Nevada Genomics Center are studying the DNA sequence of the  virus, mutations and how changes affect patients and rates of  infections.  
&gt;  
&gt;The mutation was found in 200 samples from across the  state, but primarily Northern Nevada. Many of those samples with  mutations appeared in Reno patients.  
&gt;  
&gt;The mutation was found in a protein within the COVID-19 cell. The ramifications are yet to be determined.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We  need to be sure, whatever therapeutics are being developed, they need  to be effective for any variant that comes out,"" said Dr. Subhash Verma,  associate professor of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at  UNR School of Medicine.  
&gt;  
&gt;Researchers said they expect results  within weeks to determine the mutation's impact. State health officials  are aware of the mutation.   
&gt;  
&gt;""Now that we see an outlier like this,  its cause for interest. In order for a vaccine to get evaded by a  virus, it takes an amount of time for several changes to occur,""  said Dr. Mark Pandori of the Nevada State Public Health Laboratory.   
&gt;  
&gt;Dr.  Verma is waiting for results from the Southern Nevada Health District  to examine the mutation's spread across the Las Vegas area.

As of December 21st (publish date of the above article) I haven't seen an update on this particular variant.

The global IFR (averaged over all ages) is somewhere between [0.1 and 0.5%](https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/). I'm not aware of any study suggesting anything higher than that.

The most recent and comprehensive of those studies is from John Ioannidis (basically *the* authority on infectious diseases) who settled on a global IFR of [0.15-0.20% overall and 0.03-0.04% for those &lt;70 years old](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13423).

If you prefer the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html):

* 0-19 years: 0.003%

* 20-49 years: 0.02%

* 50-69 years: 0.5%

* 70+ years: 5.4%

The [WHO](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/05/who-10percent-of-worlds-people-may-have-been-infected-with-virus-.html) also estimated a while back that 10% of the global population may have already had COVID, which at the time would've implied an IFR of 0.13%.",,,1610197380,{},ginhahe,False,t3_kth535,False,True,t1_gimgj7z,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kth535/usa_crosses_300000_cases_in_24_hours_for_the/ginhahe/,1610235930,-3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Silent lung damage
&gt;I quickly learned that many patients with advanced COVID-19 disease bore none of the hallmarks of severe respiratory illness until they suddenly collapsed and died. The science behind this early lesson is now emerging, with a study from Wuhan, China, describing pathological lung changes on CT scans of completely asymptomatic patients. Asymptomatic carriage is not uncommon in other virulent infections, such as MRSA and C diff, but what is striking with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is that it may be accompanied by underlying organ damage.

&gt;The researchers found lesions consistent with inflammation of the underlying lung tissue (ground-glass opacities and consolidation, to use the medical jargon), which are not specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may be seen in many other forms of lung disease. What remains a mystery is why, despite these changes, patients do not display typical symptoms of pneumonia, such as severe shortness of breath.

&gt;About a quarter of the patients in the study developed a fever, cough and shortness of breath – but many did not. The idiosyncratic response to infection is one of several conundrums of COVID-19, such as why it targets certain groups and not others – two people with exactly the same demography and health may express the disease at opposite ends of the spectrum. The study reinforces that absence of symptoms does not imply the absence of harm.",,,1610188799,{},gin8932,True,t3_ktm4gb,False,False,t1_gin3t3x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ktm4gb/lung_damage_from_coronavirus_can_be_long_lasting/gin8932/,1610230063,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I mean, you are correct on Viri being able to be carried without symptoms.  covid aside, we KNOW other viri can and do spread while a carrier is asymptomatic.  

As far as viral load of covid is concerned, covid is transmitted via bodily fluids(saliva, mucus, ocular fluid, fecal matter, aerosols), they can be left on a surface and picked up by others, and transferred to their body, directly deposited on the nose eyes or mouth, and finally as you said, through the aerosolized breath of infected individuals.  Does one single viral particle deposited on the eye infect an individual? We know it doesn't take an ocean of saliva.  Somewhere in between is where people can and do get infected.  

The virus can attach to particles from your body and particles in the air and hang out for a while.  Maybe some variants are better at infecting individuals with fewer viral particles.

We can't make 'educated guesses' - as a society, we've agreed to put elaborate FDA certification processes in place for a very, very good reason.

Medicine is founded on a simple principle:  ""first, do no harm"".  There are multiple potential harms that a modified dosage regimen could cause, and without supporting evidence, we need to stick to the thing we've tested and know works.

History is full of examples of rush approvals of medications that were later widely regretted - thalidomide, Pandemrix - and the US has avoided many of them through our world-leading regulatory processes.

We are not in a defensive crouch.  We have hundreds of millions of doses of known-effective vaccines arriving in the next couple of months, and our current constraint is distribution, not supply.  Against this backdrop, we should be vaccinating rapidly - with the dosage regimen we know works.  There's no need to take chances at ""optimizing"" the supply.

On the one hand I don’t think we do enough genome sequencing to discover any ‘new’ variant that ‘could’ be more transmissible and is the variant being seen more than any others across the country.  So it could be true that they haven’t seen what they aren’t looking for.  Although it’s just as likely the UK variant is the one spreading the most here... but who knows 🤷‍♀️ We have done .3% compared to UK 7.4%.  We rank 43rd behind other countries who sequence more.  Anyway...

Then there is the other side... While possibly ramping up sequencing a bit more to check for the UK variant, we discovered another unknown variant apparently trending.  Might even have evidence it our own home grown variant that is spreading more right bow. Dr. Brix admits it, and Covid denying cheerleader Trump shuts it down.  Had the CDC put out a statement contradicting her. Because we know he has had them alter, retract useful guidance only to have him freak out because the science contradicts his actions words. Let’s face it, they haven’t quite been the CDC I thought they were these past years.

So it could be either, but it honestly doesn’t matter.  What does is that our health care system is taxed and we are seeing roughly 4000 deaths a day, as predicted.  

Hopefully in six months we will be in a better place.  We just need to hope that is what will happen, even if it feels like it won’t.  If it doesn’t, we will find a way to adapt.

And as the London mutate proves, closing borders is pointless.  By the time it's identified, it's already spread everywhere.  We need to trace and contain by that point.

More hilariously, closing borders to China didn't only prove ineffective, but it basically lowered US defenses from the very reality of Europeans spreading the virus everywhere in USA.

Once the virus is found, there needs to be concerted effort into containment within each country and quarantine for foreigners.

If only we had listened to the WHO, USA wouldn't be as badly off as it currently is.

Also, it was NBC who called Trump racist.  The WHO never cited racism.

In more privileged schools, we taught online until students were officially sent back by the education department in early June.

Initially only grade 12s (final year students) returned, with the rest phasing back in from the end of July to the tune of more delays. Schools ran at 50% capacity at most, with alternating attendance for grades every other week. Around October, some schools were allowed to bring back all their students.

We pushed through until mid December, closing on the 15th, and are currently slated to reopen 25 January. In total, over 1700 teachers have died, but what makes things worse is an explosion in cases among teenagers over December with our new variant here - largely kicked off by the school leavers' festivals (Matric Rage) that went ahead despite the pandemic. Teens, alcohol, lack of supervision, and a bunch of underage attendees (technically they're meant to be over 18 and have finished grade 12, but a bunch of juniors always manage to pressure mommy and daddy dearest)...well, you can imagine what goes down.

* **Fatigue, muscle weakness are leading ailments; anxiety common**
* **Neutralizing antibodies shown to drop by more than half**

More than three-quarters of Covid-19 patients hospitalized in Wuhan between January and May had at least one persistent symptom six months later, according to a report that forebodes the enduring pain of the pandemic.

Almost two-thirds of those followed still experienced fatigue or muscle weakness half a year after their acute illness, while 26% had sleep difficulties and 23% had anxiety or depression, according to the peer-reviewed [study](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-08/www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32656-8/fulltext) of 1,733 patients in The Lancet medical journal.

The research from China [underscores ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-07/even-mildest-covid-risks-leaving-lingering-symptoms-months-later)the long-term effects of Covid-19 for individuals and societies as infections surge across the world despite budding vaccination campaigns. It also highlights the growing need for sustained care for large swaths of populations and research into the new disease’s lingering effects, according to Bin Cao, a lung specialist at the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseases in China and one of the authors.

Beyond that, the study adds credence to worries about the possibility of reinfections among those who have recovered. The researchers analyzed levels of neutralizing antibodies -- immune proteins that the body normally makes in response to viruses that can ward off repeat illness. In a group of 94 patients, levels of these antibodies fell by an average of 53% during the six-month study period after their sickness peaked.

In addition to causing pneumonia, Covid-19 is known to affect the kidneys, heart, blood vessels and other tissues. Lab tests showed that 13% of patients whose kidneys appeared healthy during their hospital stays had reduced function in the follow-up examination.

### Walking Test

For many hard-hit patients, lung function was still compromised half a year later. More than half of people who required ventilation had a reduced flow of oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream, while about a quarter of others had that problem.

Patients with severe disease also performed worse in a six-minute walking test, with about a quarter of them unable to reach the lower distance limit of the normal range, the study said.

The study followed patients discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, where the virus emerged, and their median age was 57.

“There are few reports on the clinical picture of the aftermath of Covid-19,” researchers from the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan said in an accompanying comment, and the Wuhan study is “therefore relevant and timely.”",,,1610189764,{},gin9794,True,t3_ktouq4,False,False,t3_ktouq4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ktouq4/covid_patients_symptoms_persist_six_months_in/gin9794/,1610230671,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Is their approach saving lives? Possibly. But there are other approaches that save more lives. Sweden’s approach, relying mostly on voluntary compliance, while compliance hasn’t been perfect, though it has resulted in more a lot more Covid deaths per capita, has resulted in significantly fewer excess deaths of all causes than Canada’s. Excess deaths of all causes is a more holistic and relevant measure of the quality of a response.

People are dying of covid in many countries so the vaccines can literally save lives in those places. Therefore they should go there first. Maybe NZ will take a small economic hit for the delay but with limited resources you need to allocate appropriately. 

The NZ response always centred around minimising loss of life with the opposing argument being that restrictions would be devastating for the economy. It actually turned out to be a false dichotomy, the best economic policy turned out to be a strong public health policy. 

This also makes it difficult politically to open up in the near future. Vaccines aren't perfect and even if the entire population is vaccinated there will still be some infections and deaths as the country opens to visitors. The New Zealand public would be unlikely to accept this. We would likely need to wait until the pandemic starts to die down in the rest of the world, which has always been the argument for equitable vaccine distribution anyway. There will still be outbreaks until the poor countries are vaccinated as well. 

I suspect when all is said and done that if you look through overall benefits of responses the New Zealand one will be amongst the best, though I concede the gap may close over the coming months as some countries completely open up I don't think they will catch up. 

The other thing to consider is that the NZ tourism industry has suffered much less than expected. With people unable to travel overseas and a lack of internal restrictions the domestic tourism industry has absolutely boomed. The holiday period has seen most of our tourist areas absolutely packed with restaurants and businesses doing higher than usual amounts of trade. 

I also expect the international tourism trade will absolutely boom when things open up again as NZ has been closed to visitors and has had a lot of good publicity. 

After a quick look through your post history I appreciate this may be difficult to accept but in some cultures there are principles that are valued more than money. If you have some way of valuing human life then the cost of sending vaccines to New Zealand seems much higher due to the loss of life elsewhere.",,,1610174971,{},gimtxlx,False,t3_kt4225,False,True,t1_gimo5jp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kt4225/because_of_israels_fast_distribution_of_vaccines/gimtxlx/,1610220161,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This second wave in South Africa does appear to be deadlier and not just in the sense that more people are dying because more people have been infected.

Wave 1 peak cases: 12584 (July 19th)
Wave 1 peak deaths: 298 (August 9th)

Wave 2 peak cases: 16955 (today)
Wave 2 peak deaths: 441 (today)

Cases are 35% higher now than they were at the height of wave 1, but deaths are 48% higher despite the fact that they lag (note the 3 week gap between peak cases and deaths for wave 1). If you instead look at the 7 day death average from July 19th (139) than the current numbers are... 217% higher than that.

I keep hearing that this strain is like B117 in that it isn’t any deadlier to individuals, but I think that it’s likely that either that idea will prove incorrect with more data or that South Africa’s hospitals have become so catastrophically overwhelmed that they are unable to provide adequate care across much of the country.

&gt;Rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 that have arisen in the United Kingdom and South Africa share the spike N501Y substitution, which is of particular concern because it is located in the viral receptor binding site for cell entry and increases binding to the receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme 2). We generated isogenic N501 and Y501 SARS-CoV-2.

Full disclosure, I fall into the group that is happy to wear a mask, and I do unless I'm in an environment of people that don't enforce it. Basically I would rather not wear it but of course if I'm out in public I'll read the room and do whatever is most respectful to those around me. You're not talking to someone devoid of the ability to perceive nuance, I hope that counts for something.

To sum it up, I see it as this: right now you've got everyone from that whole continuum mixing in one place. The people that don't want to wear masks aren't doing it outside of the store anyway, so putting them in with the group that is following the rules essentially nullifies that group's efforts. If you can divert even 20% of the population that is disobeying the rules to somewhere else then you not only reduce the occupancy in places full of people that do obey the rules but you also increase the percentage of people on a given space that are taking the necessary precautions outside of that space. I don't see how that's stupid. Even if it just reduces the number of people on any given space at any given time then it's valuable, it promotes social distancing.

Moreover, and this might be where we disagree, I think that people should be given the freedom to do what they want to some degree. These measures aren't sustainable. I might be biased because I've seen grown men and women with kids in tears wanting some way to provide for their families, employees wishing that they could go back to work to supply for themselves, but I feel as though there's some solution that's better than what we have now.

To me looking from another part of the world, USA took an aproach similar to Sweden, where they just cancel super-mass spreading events like sport matches with live spectators, concerts etc., but let pretty much everything else run free. I heard you still have restaurant, gyms, libraries and indoor pools opened, is that true for the most (if not whole) US?

My country has the highest tier lockdown (not in the true sence of the word though), we are not told what to do except masks and gatherings, but we are very limited in what is available to do, because anything where people meet is closed except essentials. So restaurant, theatres, shops small and big that dont sell essentials like food, flowers or drugs are closed, basically anything that is indoor and people meet there is closed. Basically we have to do this to prevent hospital collapse, but even with these restrictions we are on the edge because people just resigned on the virus and act like the god will decide for them.

Many people in my country would prefer the american way, as it does not damage economy as much, but in the same sence I believe many americans would like to see some sort of a lockdown to save lives.

The first day you take a vaccine the protection is almost non-existent. The second day is a little more. By the end of the month, you may have 85% protection. Giving a single dose of Moderna, a month or more out and they know it provides around 85% protection. 

The Pfizer trails were two doses.The single dose would have continued to increase protection, but they give a second dose before they can record the data. These are both very similar mRNA vaccines. Very similar. 

Israel, UK, Bahrain, Wachter, and Ashish are right. Simple data modeling proves the case. What I mean by that is that the first vaccine dose conveys immunity. The second dose increases the duration of that immunity. We have a current crisis where 4,000 people a day are dying. We have a crisis in immunity, not a crisis with immunity longevity.

[],,Viewfromthe31stfloor,,,[],,,,text,t2_3nelaphm,False,True,[],"About changing mRNA  vaccine doses:

&gt;Marrie Richards asks this: “It’s been argued that, in order to have enough vaccine to get more people immunized at least once, we should skip the booster shot. Is this a good idea?”

&gt;Several things have been proposed to stretch the vaccine supply: delaying the second shot; or cutting the dose in half for both the first shot and the booster; and even just giving a single shot, one and done.

&gt;The data is not robust enough to support implementing any of those. All those proposals are based on post hoc analysis of the Phase Three trials or looks at only Phase One data. To my mind, it just puts an added risk to the program without adequate evidence of benefits.

&gt;Let’s take the proposals one by one, starting with the single dose. All we know, right now, today, is that a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine will give you a modest level of protection for three weeks. It’s not very much protection. Looking at the virus neutralizing the antibody data, I would have said none, because it’s really between none and modest. So that proposal is a non-starter.

&gt;With delaying the dose, there’s the same risk. You’re just going to get people who get COVID.

&gt;Halving the dose is based on not a lot of data, from the early Phase One and Phase Two trials, that shows, “Yeah, there may be some merit to it, but it won’t be as good as the current vaccine.”

 &gt;So my question is, why would you do that? All you would do is take a dysfunctional, unworkable vaccine infrastructure, which is what we have now, and instead of a least giving people hope that it’s delivering a good vaccine, you’d give them a crummy vaccine. A crummy vaccine on top of a crummy infrastructure is a non-starter. The answer’s no.

&gt;If you look at most of the people who are tossing out these ideas, they’re not vaccine scientists. They’re smart immunologists and infectious disease docs. They like the intellectual challenge of looking at the data and sort of speculating out loud. But from my perspective, it’s not a viable approach.

&gt;So what do you do? Well, one, you have to fix the infrastructure. And also, we’re going to need more vaccine.

&gt;This gets to the problem of the mRNA vaccines. We were never supposed to rely solely on the mRNA vaccines. It’s not a mature technology. It doesn’t have the capacity to do the job. We’ve known that for the whole year of 2020.

&gt;That was the whole rationale behind Operation Warp Speed: The mRNAs would be the first to get up, but then we would have later vaccines come along that are more robust in terms of production and the ability to vaccinate large numbers of people. That’s why you have the two adenovirus-based vaccines and the particle vaccines: They were they were supposed to be the worker bees on this. The mRNA was to get started, and then the others would follow it.

&gt;Our lab has a recombinant protein vaccine, and we’re scaling up to a billion doses. If the U.S. needs vaccine, you could bring our vaccine in from India, to do this. But don’t play games with the mRNA vaccine.

&gt;Not only does the proposal fail for scientific scientific reasons, it’ll also undermine public confidence, and a lot of the public is already skittish. If they see our leaders monkeying around with doses and intervals and things like that, the whole thing will fall apart. The people who are touting this idea are oblivious to public perception around vaccines. They don’t really understand how quickly a vaccine can be voted off the island.",,,1610199841,{},ginkdia,False,t3_ktq3zt,False,False,t1_ginijpf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ktq3zt/covid_expert_peter_hotez_worried_texas_down_to/ginkdia/,1610237934,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; The governments only give rules laws and penalties but often refuse to give any assistance and support to people whose lives they just destroyed 

This is relevant to most people living in the United States. A lack of any coordinated federal response meant that individual states were forced to implement lockdowns and other stringent coronavirus-related restrictions, absent any necessary economic support. 

Consequently, 'non-essential' businesses and workers lost their incomes without the benefit of a well-planned, easily accessible safety net. It makes sense to me--although I, admittedly, rather far to the Left--that a government which orders its citizens out of work make a concerted effort to replace their earnings until such a time they can return. 

&gt; But this could have been handled infinitely better if the people in charge weren't selfish pricks caring only about their profit and reelection 

There's nothing wrong in this, either--at least if you're American. 

While I do think the Republicans hold disproportionate blame for slowing the coronavirus response, it is a fact that our government was quick to pass economic relief for large corporations--but dragged its feet in redirecting taxpayer money to actual, individual taxpayers. Even Democrats like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin have hemmed and hawed about stimulus checks and other such measures. 

The coronavirus is not *man-made* in a literal sense, but I don't think that's the point that /u/opisska was trying to make. 

Our nation's government, like many others, exacerbated the social, economic, and societal effects of coronavirus through its limited and ineffective response.

But what I'm going to suggest is that I think it's a geo-social problem.

In Europe it is not a ""predominant"" problem and across the board the vast majority are pro-vaccine, simply because there is a level of trust in the boards which are responsible for those areas.

I think other/certain regions in the world have a more ""selfish"" approach. An approach on the lines of ""I'm young, I'm healthy, covid is not a threat for me"" - I am young, I am am relatively healthy (as far as I'm aware) and I wouldn't imagine to have a big risk from covid.

Yet - I understand that others in the society I live in do not. So it is partly my ""civic duty"" to try to protect them and ""bubble them"" from the virus.

There are countries and regions where even the wearing of a mask is seen as an ""encroachment on their liberty"", whatever that may mean - the ""funny"" (sad) part was when they did a test with a cohort group telling them that the mask protects the user, rather than the other person, and suddenly they were more ""welcoming"" to wearing one - but an opposite cohort with the real information that it's a ""my mask protects you, your mask protects me"" reverted back to a ""you wear a mask and protect me, I don't see a point in wearing mine"".

So yeah, I guess you do have liberty to decide if you want to take it or not.. in a selfish way.. the problem is that since they don't see an immediate ""need"" for it, they discard it, and worse, spread false rumors on it's safety or with the ""yOu dOn'T kNoW wHaT'S iN iT"".",,,1610222603,{},gioqygl,False,t3_kt5ow3,False,True,t1_gio5aer,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kt5ow3/biden_will_release_all_available_vaccine_doses/gioqygl/,1610263689,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

While combining two different studies' results together generally isn't helpful, their results are so similar that it feels like the best way to explain what we know right now. 

In two Phase 3 studies (the ones for Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech), a total of 74,000 people received either a vaccine or a placebo.

Of those, 265 people contracted a confirmed, symptomatic case of SARS-CoV-2.

Of those, 252 of them had the placebo, so we'd expect approximately 252 in the vaccine group would have similarly been diagnosed based on the large and varied sample size.

In those vaccine groups, only 13 were similarly diagnosed,  meaning approximately 239 people were protected from symptomatic infection by the vaccines, which is 94.84% of them.

About risk for male fertility:
&gt;ACE2 is expressed in the testes and epididymis, in particular in Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, and spermatogonia (Wang and Xu, 2020). Moreover, the testicular expression of ACE2 is age-related, with a higher expression in patients aged 20–30, whereas as 60+-year-old patients show a reduced expression of ACE2, it could mean that young men are at higher risk of testicular damage by the virus than older patients. Although ACE2 is the key receptor for the virus, this is not enough to guarantee its entry into the host cell; the co-presence of TMPRSS2 is crucial: KE. Stanley et al. (2020) carried out an interesting study based on the evaluation of co-expression of the host virus entry proteins on male reproductive cells. According to this study, ACE2 is expressed in male myoid cells, spermatogonial stem cells, and Leydig cells, while TMPRSS2 expression is detected predominantly in elongated spermatides. Despite the fact that a small proportion of spermatogonial stem cells express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, finding cells which co-express both genes is extremely rare, and scRNAseq data results suggest that spermatozoa may not be susceptible to virus infection owing to the lack of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression. 

About risk for female fertility:
&gt; ACE2 is widely expressed in the ovary, uterus, vagina and placenta.

About antibody dependant enhancement;

Oxford had *superior* efficacy with a longer delay between doses, (3 months instead of 3 weeks) but 1) their sample size was small and 2) this might be due to their presumed vector immunity problem and might not apply to mRNA vaccines. We don't know about Pfizer because they didn't study it:

""There isn’t much for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, as trials did not compare different dose spacing or compare one with two doses. The trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine did include different spacing between doses, finding that a longer gap (two to three months) led to a greater immune response, but the overall participant numbers were small."" https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n18

My understanding is that immunology is really complicated and no one would be able to say for sure without the data, but it's is quite possible that a prolonged interval between the first and second dose would lead to a more lasting immune memory than a shorter interval for the mRNA vaccines as well. I mean, obviously giving the two doses a day apart would not be good, but we don't know if the best combo is 3 weeks or 3 months apart because it was not tested.

The current UK variant is (according to reports) possibly the result of the virus mutating excessively within a patient/host with a weakened immune system.

Given that we saw (even through other mutations) that this is quite common for this virus (adapting and mutating) wouldn't you think that there might be a situation that somebody getting infecting with covid _after_ the first dose could lead to a situation where the virus could mutate once again, this time in a way to overwhelm the partial (because it _is_ partial with one dose) and thus rendering the vaccine obsolete?

Granted - this could occur even on the 3 weeks waiting time, but between 3 weeks to 12+ you're increasing the risk 4x fold - actually, much, much more due to a compound effect with having multiple people vaccinated with 1 dose over that period of time.

Maybe 3 weeks wouldn't be enough for the virus to ""fight back and mutate"" (against the vaccine), but 12 weeks + could.

WASHINGTON—President-elect [Joe Biden](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/joe-biden) will seek to release nearly all available coronavirus vaccine doses to accelerate distribution, his transition team said Friday, in a shift from the Trump administration’s policy of holding back stock for second doses.

“The president-elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the Americans who need it most get it as soon as possible,” said TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden’s transition. “He supports releasing available doses immediately, and believes the government should stop holding back vaccine supply so we can get more shots in Americans’ arms now.”

#### Mr. Ducklo said Mr. Biden, who will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, will release additional details about his vaccine distribution plans next week. They include establishing federally run vaccination sites, as well as mobile units that can travel to rural and underserved areas, and the launch of a national public awareness campaign around vaccine safety and guidelines, said incoming White House press secretary Jen Psaki.

The announcement comes as the U.S. and many other countries are [struggling to ramp up vaccination programs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccines-remain-elusive-for-many-doctors-health-care-workers-11610046715?mod=article_inline).

Once the lockdown is over, the government can afford to pay the businesses/people the 21 days it shut down in lost wages and tax breaks so the businesses don’t die. 

The virus has a limited lifespan once it’s not on living tissue. I believe that number to be 14 days at the most.

When one country does this, others will follow, and once another country is cleared, they can reopen foreign travel to those countries.

The article you've cited referenced the **NEW** deal signed with Pfizer, the NYT article predates that, as you yourself mentioned here, as does the Israeli massive successful vaccination campaign up to this point.

Thus only insignificant relations can be established between the vaccination up to this point and the military.

&gt; ""Only very few countries have more daily cases than Israel""\[[source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-still-worlds-best-for-vaccination-but-now-among-worst-for-contagion/)\] 

Most countries hardly test. The number of positively tested people is not equal to the number of daily cases. The real number of new cases is better represented by the number of deceased when comparing 1st world countries to 1st world countries.

For example. Yesterday Israel had 6,300 positive tests and 44 fatalities. Hungary had only 2900 positive tests but 115 fatalities, Romania had only 4,800 positives but 96 fatalities, Bulgaria had only 750 positives but 61 fatalities, and so did Greece.

You'd have us believe that these countries have vastly higher death rate than Israel? While in reality most likely they have much more daily cases, that is obscured by low testing. I really did expected a more intelligent discussion.

&gt;saying that he likely didn't want todo his job, because he made such a poor work of it 

There's plenty to improve, but Netenyahu did a better job than almost every other western country if measured by deaths per capita or economic damage. Only countries that did better are east Asian (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam) or Australia and New Zealand.

Pointing out that your position is completely baseless is not ""nitpicking"".

I think 70% efficacy will not be enough for most countries to end the lock down in time when there's a lot of resentment against the vaccine, if you reduce the efficacy over time by trading the longevity it will be even lower. Now I am sure enough that there will not be major production outages for the two-dose-vaccines and more vaccines will be approved to get the job done. But that also means the 70-90% efficacy vaccines will be about to be deployed in time anyway, and therefore I feel that the 95% ones that we already have should be made sure to be administered correctly, just in case.

Because generally efficacy is extremely important for how fast we achieve the long term goal:

If you need 60% of reliably immune people to achieve herd immunity (a lower estimate communicated by our local equivalent of the CDC) but only have 70% efficacy, you need 85% of population have the vaccine to reach that threshold.

For 95% efficacy however you only need 63% of a given population to be vaccinated.

If you have a strong anti-vax movement *and* play with the efficacy to untested effects, we might even not reach that goal if everyone who wanted a vaccine takes it.

Under that threshold though it will still come to surges that will overwhelm ICUs, avoiding this is the main point were doing that whole flatten the curve thing. That might mean that even if were handing out all the doses as soon as we get them vs. handing them out as soon as they're needed, we still might have to employ a lock down anyway.

Not even mentioning that all surges raise the chance that this Virus can mutate further and might drop the efficacy again. Tough calculation.

The deaths per capita issue is separate from the CFR issue. The former is kind of philosophical: do you want to profoundly damage quality of life for almost everybody (in a 'fundamental human need for human contact' way, not a 'first world problem' way), deprive countless families of their livelihoods, ruin probably at least 10-20% of youths' mental health by locking everything down for months upon months until a vaccine is found (\*), or do you want to just have Covid whip through the population like a bad flu season, achieve herd immunity but let about 0.30% (3 in a thousand) of the population die? A complicated issue, and thorny, but worth discussing.

Separate from this is the CFR issue: if, indeed, overloading hospitals past a certain case theshold increases probability of death, say, by an order of magnitude (thus increasing the IFR to from 0.3% to say 3%), then the answer to the first question skews towards ""yes, lock down"", although I still think that discussion is worth having.

I don't know whether you remember the initial justification for the lockdown: give the medical system time to adjust and prevent the case threshold being reached. That goal seems to have been accomplished, and the goalposts have been shifted.

Clearly you've got two sides. For the sake of argument let's call them pro-mask and anti-mask. Neither of those is meant to bear any negative connotation. I really don't care what anyone believes and will respect anyone's point of view as long as they're not an asshole about it.

So, this in mind, you've got one group that's following the rules and another that is most likely doing their own thing. These two groups of course mix in places like supermarkets, Walmart, etc. One group wants everything opened, the other wants everything locked down.

What if we were to allow small businesses to open up at their discretion, without any formal restrictions on what they can/can't do, while maintaining that big box stores and corporations continue to uphold the current efforts in distancing, masks, etc.

This way, you effectively separate the two groups. Theoretically, if following the rules stops the spread, there is less of a chance that someone that's following the rules will run into someone that isn't since those that would rather return to some sense of normalcy and are aware of the risks have places to shop that support that and don't need to congregate at the same places that people with precautions are. Additionally you actually allow both groups to have their cake and eat it too - you want normalcy? You've got it. You want safety? You've got it, and more of it, with fewer crowds and a higher percentage of people in those smaller crowds that follow the same rules you do. Not to mention the fact that small businesses can open and people can keep their livelihoods.

1) For younger people it's looking like best case scenario for vaccinations is summer with full effect 1.5 months later (2 doses + 14 days) so really more like fall.  That's a long time to stay cooped up.

2) Young kids are not even being put in vaccine trials so the next school year will almost certainly start with young kids unvaccinated.  If you wait for vaccinations for kids to resume normal life you are looking at 2022 which is a long time developmentally.

3)  There are some truly heartbreaking Covid stories out there but in general people have normalized having older people die of various issues and in a given year about 3,000,000 die so adding an extra 10% on top of that is not as noticeable.

Ultimately, people building diagnostic tests and vaccines looked at many more sequences produced from patients around the world and saw nothing in that data which differed from the original data which would cause them to make revisions.

So you begin working with the data set you could get as fast as possible, and then validate that nothing needs to change as the data comes in from other samples.

There's also a really easy tell for the design of the test....  It literally still works on people with COVID-19.

I think Moderna said they had the initial vaccine design done 2 days after they had the first genomic data in hand.

There's a very easy way to compensate for all those factors though. You look how fast the UK variant spreads compared to the original variant in areas where they're both prevalent. It's very clear that the UK variant outcompetes the original variant very quickly wherever it's present, and all the factors you mentioned would be identical for both variants in the same area. If you look at pretty much any scientific paper trying to estimate how infectious it is, they all pretty much come to the conclusion that it's 50%+ more infectious.

&gt;literally just a matter of waiting through a few more shitty months and doing everything we can to suppress the new variant. i think we'll still get through the worst of it by the end of next month like people have predicted.

This is very dangerous thinking, because if you model the spread with 2 different variants with various infectivity, you should expect 2 peaks.

Coronavirus: Doctors urge men not to inject COVID-19 vaccine into their penis
09/01/2021
Dan Satherley

A doctor who appears in a viral social media post claiming doctors have found the COVID-19 vaccine works best for men if it's injected directly into the penis has labelled it a ""work of mischief"". 

The post, which has been circulating on Facebook since the new year, is clearly fake - but it's fooled many people, including some here in New Zealand, where it's been spread by pages set up by supporters of outgoing US President Donald Trump. 

""And just like that, all the men on Earth became 'antivax' overnight,"" one person who shared it commented. 

The image appears to be a screenshot of a CNN article with the headline: 'Doctors encourage covid-19 vaccine injections in penis.' The synopsis falsely claims, 'Doctors are discovering that, for male patients, the penis offers the fastest release of the vaccine throughout the body.'

It's accompanied by a picture of Mohitkumar Ardeshana, a hormone therapy doctor from Biote Medical's Claremont Medical Center in California.

""The article is completely fake,"" he told fact-checking site Boom Live. ""I have not said anything about such a study. It is a work of mischief by someone.""

Australia's AAP FactCheck backed that up, saying the terrifying drawing of a needle being stabbed into a penis is actually instructions on ""how to perform a self-injection procedure to treat erectile dysfunction"" from the website of Kansas City’s Saint Luke's healthcare service. 

The post also falsely claims the discovery was made by researchers at the University of California, who confirmed it was ""untrue"". 

Both the two most-widely distributed vaccines so far - one made by Moderna, the other Pfizer/BioNTech - are injected into the arm, like most other vaccines. 

AAP FactCheck also notes the article doesn't follow typical CNN style - the US news network doesn't spell the disease all in lower-case, doesn't have full stops at the end of its headlines and is missing an author byline and publication date. The font is also wrong. 

The past year has seen huge amounts of misinformation and disinformation on the COVID-19 spread online, including that it doesn't exist, isn't any worse than the flu or that the vaccine contains microchips created by philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. 

In reality it's killed nearly 2 million people, is spreading faster than ever right now, and the approved vaccines appear to have over 90 percent efficacy with few side-effects, according to clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people. 

There have been reports of severe reactions at rates significantly higher than older vaccines, but they're still incredibly rare - about 11 in every 1 million vaccine doses.",,,1610192388,{},ginbtw8,False,t3_ktpcd4,False,True,t3_ktpcd4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ktpcd4/doctors_urge_men_not_to_inject_covid19_vaccine/ginbtw8/,1610232394,26,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

So you wouldn't even separate them at the store. And of course, this wouldn't apply to other places where people meet, from workplaces to funerals to transit, so it would be a lot of effort and legislation for fairly minor separation overall.

Your idea would do almost nothing to stop the pandemic, and that's why actual policy-makers are not putting a lot of effort into complicated mask-enforcement schemes at this time.

When it comes to COVID-19 patients — even those who have been given the all-clear — she said their lungs might tell a different story. 

The story started with a tweet from Bankhead-Kendall:


It quickly grabbed the attention of thousands, the message coming straight from a doctor who has spent the last 10 months on the COVID-19 frontlines.

“I thought it was really pertinent that people understand that this isn’t a bimodal disease,” said Bankhead-Kendall. “It’s not you have it and then it’s gone, it’s something that is lingering.”

Just for reference, we’ve included what a pair of healthy lungs look like. The X-ray shows two clean cavities — the black spaces are air, no congestion. We have also included what they look like on a CT scan. 

For those who smoke, we’ve also included a visual of what’s typically happening inside their chest. In the interview, Bankhead-Kendall points out the scarring left over from a lifetime of smoking. 


Healthy lungs (left) and smoker lungs (right)
“Whenever I pull up that smoker’s lung, kind of immediately what I’m seeing is maybe a little of what we’d call ‘congestion.’ The heart getting a little bit fatigued, it’s not pumping things through as well,” she said.

And then Bankhead-Kendall pulled up an X-ray of “post-COVID” lungs. This is how she described them: “And so on these chest X-rays when you see a dense, cobwebby looking appearance, that’s what it is — it’s old, residual COVID-19. Or problems with your lungs that happened because we were trying to treat you and keep you alive and it just didn’t get better.”


Smoker lungs (left) and COVID-19 lungs (right)
She says X-rays like these are now lighting up frequently for her at the hospital — sometimes the only common denominator shared among the patients being that they had the virus. Severe chest scans coming from people who didn’t even have a hospital stay. 

“Not everyone who is doing really, really poorly has a terrible chest X-ray,” she said. “And not everyone who is doing really, really well has a good-looking chest X-ray.”


Healthy lungs (left) vs. COVID-19 lungs (right)
And because it hasn’t even been a year since the pandemic’s onset, it’s too early for evidence-based studies to show the impact of COVID-19 on different organs. However, Bankhead-Kendall said she has now seen enough sets of “post-COVID” lungs to label the damage a trend. 

“I mean it’s not only a trend, it is the norm,” she said. “It’s the norm that when you’re sitting there and going over the list of patients for the day and you’re scrolling through CT scans and you’re pulling up X-rays, you can immediately tell, ‘Yea, this person has had COVID-19, this person has not had COVID-19.” 

How to watch NewsNation: WGNA Channel Finder 
Bankhead-Kendall also told NewsNation another alarming piece to the puzzle is that it is too early to tell if these damaged lungs will repair themselves over time, or if the scarring is permanent. She gets her second round of the COVID-19 vaccine on Friday, and she urges Americans to do the same. She said any long-term effects that may come with the vaccine will not be as bad as what she is seeing right now in the hospital.

Him as a political leader has _0_ academic say in this.

His scientists/advisors might have _some_ say.

Do you know who has the _most_ (unequivocal) say?
The manufacturer of the vaccine.

The manufacturer of the vaccine _explicitly_ warned AGAINST doing so.

I'm sure that ""he wants to end the pandemic as quickly as possible"" - but that shouldn't come at a cost of unnecessary risk.

This is the same reason why we have a vaccine _now_ and not 6 months ago.

The formula between today and 6 months ago in phase 3 _did not change_ *but* couldn't be used until proven to be safe (dosing time frame _is_ part of safety) - yet, they didn't just roll it out ""to end the pandemic as quickly as possible"" because there were risks.

We spent over a year doing things properly.
Why the fu** are we introducing risks _now_ to ""win"" a couple of weeks?

I do suggest to read up on why there are risks involved in tempering with the dosage and dosage timeframes - one closing point, it seems like not all advisors are really on board with that:

She said her father went to a big Gaelic Football match in Dublin (60 miles away) and brought back polio with him. The match was supposed to be cancelled but went ahead as it was a final,( I guess like superbowl now?)

He went and my grandmother begged him not to go but he went. Boy did he live to regret it. My oldest Aunt caught polio and had to go alone at 8 years old to a polio hospital which was in the next county. (no one had cars so it might as well have been another country. For reference,  Can you imagine as an American having to send your tiny little eight year old girl to Canada, completely alone, for many months with no way to contact them and hope they don't die?) My mother said her father cried &amp; when she returned, she was skin and bone.

The whole house was isolated and wasn't allowed to go anywhere. They depended entirely on the generosity of neighbours to bring flour and milk &amp; neighborhood kids went to the library and brought books for them. They grew their own vegetables, potatoes etc so atleast they had food. 

My mother didn't go to school for months and my other aunt caught polio but she was caught very early and was treated much quicker so she didn't suffer as much, she also went to a polio hospital but in a different place than her sister. Polio was rampant.

 My eldest aunt returned home as a cripple (to use that generation's words) She had to wear metal calipers on her legs to support her, she couldn't walk very well as her bones and hips were somewhat deformed due to polio. My aunt is still alive and in her eighties now. However she suffered all her life do to contracting polio.

Ask anyone of that generation what they think of vaccines and they'll tell you what they know about life without vaccines. They are appalled and angry at the nonsense people spout. They've seen and experienced first hand the devastation that diseases cause.

Since your interested in experiences and culture...... My grandmother was 96 when she died 20 years ago. She was born in 1905 and remembered the Spanish flu. She lived in an isolated village but a family did contract it and nobody would go near them. There was no running water at the time, so the family had no water, no food and no way to contact anyone. 

My grandmother brought buckets of water and potatoes to the family and left them at the front door. If the food was gone the next morning so would bring more. Her mother wouldn't let her into the house and she slept in the chicken shed. The chickens were moved into the cow shed. She was 13 or 14 years old. 

A year later the mother of the family who had been sick met her and gave her a purse to repay her kindess.( A good few of the family had died of the flu but some lived) In the purse was a sixpence. It was all the money the woman had. The woman gave her the purse with the sixpence and said she was sorry she didn't have more to give but gave her a blessing and wished that my grandmother would never go without, and that she'd always find a few pence somewhere if she needed it.

My grandmother had the purse all her life and swore that when she was really stuck for money and had absolutely nothing, not even enough to buy food, a shilling or two would always show up in the purse. 

Nowadays, whenever I gift someone a handbag or a purse I always put a couple of euro in it and wish them the same thing.",,,1610203264,{},ginpept,False,t3_kt5a2t,False,True,t1_gilitiu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kt5a2t/ireland_reports_100_uptake_on_vaccine_in/ginpept/,1610241106,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You are somewhat right about the finances. A factory that goes down for months (diapers, rags, air filters, etc) of tooling in March will not return a profit on the conversion. A factory that just needs to add a mask machine can (and all did) convert in a few weeks and turn a very tidy profit along the way.  
  
The largest suppliers in the US also have long-term government contracts for all of their production. That does not extend to the entire industry, just the companies capable of ramping up production.

I remember receiving a call in 2008 from someone who had received the news much earlier than CNN that Russia had invaded Georgia and we need to act now! This was an anti-war group that I was a member of talking about “Americas aggression” in the Russian invasion of Georgia. I went on to be part of the unit who trained the Georgian SF (yes that was the problem, we trained the Georgian SF who stopped the invasion) and we were no longer allowed to work with our allies and instead we would do an official training event with Russian paratroopers instead. One of the only times I give a non-ironic “Thanks Obama.”

The next time I experienced something so flagrant was in that unit I’m referencing. I was going to the clinic for mental health after a deployment. During treatment I also came out as transgender. This was mostly a secret but a closeted bi girl outed me to the unit. At first it was no big deal, some operators came and found me to let me know people are spreading rumors. As I wasn’t requesting any accommodations, first sergeant and commanding officer just let me be and said we would figure it out after we figured out if my mental health issues are temporary or permanent.

Within six months from that time I found myself in a race to receive my medical retirement before I became a victim of violence from my peers or lost all my benefits because I am queer. It seemed like overnight many of my Republican peers found hate for me. The officers (Typically Christian, Republican) were having to get involved to halt the fascist and anti-trans propaganda around the office. Despite us being the people supposed to identify and counter Russia, half my peers were doing their bidding.

Since that time I have found myself with less and less excuses for why this all happened. Seems pretty obvious that it’s a mentality that makes one susceptible and not education or any of the other factors people often mention. Democrats are not vulnerable to this type of attack due to their mentality. Republicans are.

The other side is, their only source of social interaction outside of immediate family is social media. This will in turn make them less aware of posture, less likely to understand social cues/have less social awareness of undertones, and more likely to crave attention whether that be through risky behavior (unprotected sex, sexual assault), narcissism, or other antisocial behaviors.

While you're thinking, I can tell you what the UK does.  They randomly test people on the street for COVID, then wait 28 days to see if they die.  IFR has varied from 0.4-0.9% over the course of the pandemic there.

In Colorado we track every case and death by its day of symptom onset.  This lets you match cases and deaths up on the same day, which can otherwise be a problem (the 3900 deaths the USA had today are linked to cases from 7-35 days ago, and numbers have varied wildly in that time).  Colorado's CFR has been a constant 1.0% (60-day rolling average, ranging from 0.6-1.6% in individual weeks.  However this does not include the missing cases (probably around half) that go untested.

These numbers are perfectly consistent with each other since CO is much, much younger than the UK: 0.65% annual mortality versus 0.90%.

a few quotes:

&gt;&gt;Marrie Richards asks this: “It’s been argued that, in order to have enough vaccine to get more people immunized at least once, we should skip the booster shot. Is this a good idea?”

&gt;Several things have been proposed to stretch the vaccine supply: delaying the second shot; or cutting the dose in half for both the first shot and the booster; and even just giving a single shot, one and done.

&gt;The data is not robust enough to support implementing any of those. All those proposals are based on post hoc analysis of the Phase Three trials or looks at only Phase One data. To my mind, it just puts an added risk to the program without adequate evidence of benefits.

&gt;Let’s take the proposals one by one, starting with the single dose. All we know, right now, today, is that a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine will give you a modest level of protection for three weeks. It’s not very much protection. Looking at the virus neutralizing the antibody data, I would have said none, because it’s really between none and modest. So that proposal is a non-starter.

&gt;With delaying the dose, there’s the same risk. You’re just going to get people who get COVID.

&gt;Halving the dose is based on not a lot of data, from the early Phase One and Phase Two trials, that shows, “Yeah, there may be some merit to it, but it won’t be as good as the current vaccine.”

&gt;So my question is, why would you do that? All you would do is take a dysfunctional, unworkable vaccine infrastructure, which is what we have now, and instead of a least giving people hope that it’s delivering a good vaccine, you’d give them a crummy vaccine. A crummy vaccine on top of a crummy infrastructure is a non-starter. The answer’s no.

&gt;If you look at most of the people who are tossing out these ideas, they’re not vaccine scientists. They’re smart immunologists and infectious disease docs. They like the intellectual challenge of looking at the data and sort of speculating out loud. But from my perspective, it’s not a viable approach.

&gt;So what do you do? Well, one, you have to fix the infrastructure. And also, we’re going to need more vaccine.

&gt;This gets to the problem of the mRNA vaccines. We were never supposed to rely solely on the mRNA vaccines. It’s not a mature technology. It doesn’t have the capacity to do the job. We’ve known that for the whole year of 2020.

&gt;That was the whole rationale behind Operation Warp Speed: The mRNAs would be the first to get up, but then we would have later vaccines come along that are more robust in terms of production and the ability to vaccinate large numbers of people. That’s why you have the two adenovirus-based vaccines and the particle vaccines: They were they were supposed to be the worker bees on this. The mRNA was to get started, and then the others would follow it.

&gt;Our lab has a recombinant protein vaccine, and we’re scaling up to a billion doses. If the U.S. needs vaccine, you could bring our vaccine in from India, to do this. But don’t play games with the mRNA vaccine.

&gt;Not only does the proposal fail for scientific scientific reasons, it’ll also undermine public confidence, and a lot of the public is already skittish. If they see our leaders monkeying around with doses and intervals and things like that, the whole thing will fall apart. The people who are touting this idea are oblivious to public perception around vaccines. They don’t really understand how quickly a vaccine can be voted off the island.",,,1610199302,{},ginjnoz,True,t3_ktq3zt,False,True,t3_ktq3zt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ktq3zt/covid_expert_peter_hotez_worried_texas_down_to/ginjnoz/,1610237470,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I trust science.
I trust the scientists and the pharma group.
I trust the test and the trials.

But I do *not* (categorically) trust anyone else to make a decision on the _vaccine_ who is _not_ either the manufacturer or who conducted the trials.

If Pfizer (in this case) had this statement:

_Pfizer has stated the efficacy is only 52% at the first dose and they have NO DATA to support delaying the second dose. *They're urging Quebec to adhere to the recommended dosage schedule*_

Then _that_ is the answer.
The president, a public figure, a political group deciding to take decisions themselves on a matter which is *not in their competence* is dangerous, and frankly, irresponsible.

Using _other tried and tested_ methods with other vaccines as an example has no bearing:

A - I'd imagine they ran _tests_ on delaying boosters on other vaccines before attempting it (they did not in this case).


B - The way this vaccine has been formulated is different than others being used in comparison (mRNA vs traditional methods).


These thoughts are being made not for me to make a decision.

But to decide _who makes a decision for me_.

Pfizer doing the tests, trials, and getting approved is _enough_ to accept the vaccine.

A president (or Canada law makers, or even UK) deciding to ""dilute"" the stock (which is basically what they're doing), I don't.

https://www.revespcardiol.org/en-myocardial-infarction-in-times-covid-19-articulo-S1885585720304618


«The article by Rodríguez-Leor et al. shows that, in the worst part of the first wave of the pandemic, there was a significant reduction—up to 30%—in the number of patients treated for AMI in our health care system. This outcome has been seen in other countries6–9 and thus appears to be global. The most plausible explanation is that patients chose to stay at home with symptoms that previously would have motivated emergency service contact or hospital attendance. This hypothesis is supported by the significant increase in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Italy.10 However, in the article by Rodríguez-Leor et al.,2 the incidences of cardiogenic shock at admission, need for orotracheal intubation, and mechanical complications were not different between patients admitted during the COVID-19 period and those from the previous year, which fails to support the theory that many patients experienced AMI at home and only contacted the emergency services when the symptoms were very severe (when the AMI was advanced). An alternative (and complementary) explanation would be that the massive confinement of the population lowered physical activity and, above all, drastically reduced pollution, which is a known trigger of AMI.11»

Anyways, nice. You find the original article ok.

If you buy the numbers in the article, there’s little to argue about here. Accept the sentiment that «this seems about right» as per my original comment. 

You don’t need to worry too much about the why’s and how’s the total is reached. Agree to disagree about how the flu and other factors intertwine and let’s just agree to disagree in that changes in society during covid has the potential to alter the course of other death frequencies in both a negative and positive way. Like you said earlier; it’s the total of excess deaths that counts, is it not? 

I’m for one are about done arguing about sublayers that really doesn’t matter in the end. 

Thousands died (in my view needlessly, but everyone will have a different take on that) in Sweden in 2020, excess deaths were up significantly, while some neighbours had a reduction in deaths overall in 2020.

However, large-scale clinics, ***such as those held in arenas or stadiums,*** those held over multiple days or those conducted during emergency scenarios, will likely require added logistical and technical considerations.

Janssen (not yet approved) did double-blind, randomized single and double dose phase III trials (I participated in the single dose). It is an altered adenovirus (26) with a spike protein, similar to what they did for the Ebola vaccine. Both Pfizer and Moderna (both approved) use mRNA suspended in nanolipids. Promising science, but also a lot newer (the upside is it only introduces the material to make the protein, which is not as likely to cause serious complications - the downside is the nanolipids require super cooling to avoid them breaking down). 

Having worked with pet rescues for a long time, I know the recommendation is to start over when you miss a vaccination. I am not sure if this is being overly cautious or what the evidence is for pets, but it is the course for any animal that misses the dates.

With the current vaccines, the efficacy of the first dose varies, both in in effectiveness and timeframe they were tested at. Efficacy has been shown much higher after the second dose.

&gt;Up to 59% of all disease transmission came from asymptomatic people, with 35% from those who later developed symptoms and 24% from those who never did, according to the researchers.  
          
&gt;In addition, nearly one in four cases of virus spread involves infected people who remain asymptomatic, the researchers estimated. 
       
&gt;""To control the pandemic, we must address the 'silent pandemic' of spread from persons without symptoms,"" study co-author Dr. Jay Butler told UPI.   
       
&gt;The findings highlight the importance of public health measures such as social distancing, mask-wearing and hand-washing -- even for people who don't feel sick -- in preventing the spread of the virus, they said.  
         
&gt;""Strategically planned testing of persons who are not ill, such as those known to have been exposed to COVID-19 or those with frequent unavoidable contact with the public, can likely also reduce the spread of COVID-19,"" he said.",,,1610217268,{},giofr8r,True,t3_ktwhi5,False,True,t3_ktwhi5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ktwhi5/study_symptomfree_infected_people_cause_at_least/giofr8r/,1610257144,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; These data suggest that T cell memory might reach a more stable plateau, or slower decay phase, beyond the first 8 months post-infection.

So declines but then levels out?

Also:

&gt; Beyond sterilizing immunity, immune responses that confine SARS-CoV-2 to the URT and oral cavity would minimize COVID-19 disease severity to that of a ‘common cold’ or asymptomatic disease.

So basically if it can suppress the virus to just the nose/mouth and upper respiratory tract, it won't be any worse than a common cold?

However:

&gt; It is therefore possible that a fraction of the SARS-CoV-2-infected population with low immune memory would become susceptible to re-infection relatively soon.

But:

&gt; Nevertheless, our data show immune memory in at least three immunological compartments was measurable in ~95% of subjects 5 to 8 months PSO, indicating that durable immunity against secondary COVID-19 disease is a possibility in most individuals.

Ideally nobody would have been infected.

It's the result of multiple factors which I'm not going to mention as they might be controversial (but let's just say that a big chunk of people I know have been living in denial with their actions....)

Vaccinating more people at the cost of doing it badly (1 dose, or 2 doses _but on a non-trialed time frame_) because _too many people died_ or _if not there will be impacts on economy_ does not change the fact that this is going against the data from trials/has risks.

&gt; the Pfizer and Moderna trials tracked only how many vaccinated people became sick with Covid-19. That leaves open the possibility that some vaccinated people get infected without developing symptoms, and could then silently transmit the virus — especially if they come in close contact with others or stop wearing masks.

&gt;If vaccinated people are silent spreaders of the virus, they may keep it circulating in their communities, putting unvaccinated people at risk.

&gt;“A lot of people are thinking that once they get vaccinated, they’re not going to have to wear masks anymore,” said Michal Tal, an immunologist at Stanford University. “It’s really going to be critical for them to know if they have to keep wearing masks, because **they could still be contagious**.”


https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/12/18/coronavirus-vaccines-are-proven-to-prevent-disease-but-what-about-transmission/

&gt;The two vaccines approved for use in the U.S. — Pfizer’s a week ago and Moderna’s on Friday — have both been shown to reduce the risk of serious disease from COVID-19 by about 95%. But Moderna provided only preliminary findings on how well its vaccine prevents coronavirus carriers from transmitting the virus, and Pfizer submitted none at all. **Those who are vaccinated still may get the virus, and if they still can pass it on**, that could prolong the pandemic.

&gt;“At the moment, we don’t know whether these vaccines will reduce transmission,” said Dr. Arthur Reingold, the chairman of California’s vaccine safety workgroup and division head of epidemiology and biostatistics at UC Berkeley. “But that’s quite plausible. It’s just that we really don’t have the data yet.”",,,1610212202,{},gio5nce,False,t3_ktsgsf,False,False,t1_gio2bun,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ktsgsf/queen_and_prince_philip_get_covid_vaccine/gio5nce/,1610251022,41,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;Adding, we shouldn't ""change behaviors solely on the basis of vaccination.""

The chairman of Pfizer doesn't seem so confident either:

https://www.businessinsider.com/pfizer-chairman-not-clear-people-spread-covid-19-after-vaccine-2020-12?op=1

&gt;The chairman of Pfizer said it's not clear whether people who have taken the company's coronavirus vaccine will still be able to spread the virus to other people.

&gt;Albert Bourla told NBC's ""Dateline"" that more studies had to be done into whether someone who had been vaccines could still transmit the coronavirus.

&gt;Host Lester Holt asked Bourla: ""Even though I've had the protection, am I still able to transmit it to other people?""

&gt;Bourla then responded: ""I think this is something that needs to be examined. We are not certain about that right now with what we know.""


And by the way, AZ/Oxford actually *did* check for it:

&gt;The makers of the two other vaccines in play have reported only evidence that their drugs keep people from getting sick—which is to say, fewer vaccinated people have moderate to severe symptoms and test positive for infection.

According to a university created Covid calculator my chance of dying from Covid is 0.0006%.  I have a higher chance of having a sudden brain aneurysm.

I would personally be waiting and it has nothing to do with misinformation.  It is a calculated risk that I would choose to take.  The vaccines do not stop you getting or carrying Sars2.  They are supposed to stop someone from developing dangerous symptoms that lead to hospitalisations and sadly death in many cases.   We won't for a couple of years really know the full impact of the vaccines on the mortality rate.  The purpose of the flu vaccine each year is to reduce mortality.  It does achieve this though results depend on the uptake of it.  I think the European Respiratory Journal has it at 30% reduction, but that will vary year to year.

As of 18 hours ago [Bloomberg reported 7.02 vaccinations](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/). 

I could probably search down more guesses presented as numbers. There is one big thing to take away from all this and a few smaller things. The big thing is that **nobody knows for sure** about the numbers administered to any acceptable degree of accuracy. As we speak now there could very well be over 7 million doses administered. There could, however, be even more or there could be fewer. These numbers aren't graven in stone.

Smaller things. 

This is not unexpected. especially in the case of the USA where the medical system is naturally chaotic and, in fact, quite insufficient when compared to other countries (the USA rates down at number 38 when national medical systems are compared). 

Is this a 'disaster' ? I wouldn't say that, but it is definitely **bad**, especially compared to the ""promise"" that there would be 20 million vaccinated by December 31. It could, however, be far worse, and it hasn't fulfilled my worst fears. The situation in Brazil where various parts of government are still in battle mode with each other is probably worse. The situation in Russia 'may' be worse for other reasons. 

I hope things improve, and they very well might. I'm uncertain about the stated policy of the incoming Administration to 'shoot its load' and release all the vaccines at once, leaving the boosters in the hands of destiny.

Think of it in a game theory kind of way, imagine a world where everybody else has the MMR vaccine and you have the choice to take it or not. You can see how the balance in that situation, from a purely self interested view, might lean towards not getting the vaccine since the diseases are effectively eradicated and the vaccine carries some risk of side effects. Now take that same equation and wonder at what percent of the population being vaccinated is the tipping point where getting the vaccine becomes beneficial? Again, from a purely self interested point of view.

Now I completely understand that there is more than self interest involved and the argument for getting the vaccine for the community's sake. But that is rarely represented in the argument, people are told that it is in 100% their best interest to get the vaccine and the collectivist argument is glossed over, I think that's disingenuous.

possible reason: they have roughly 4x the number of hospital beds per capita than the US (i didn't bother looking up every other country), so belarus would have to have 4x the number of cases per capita compared to the US to appear as ""full"" as the US.

One dose of the vaccine does not convey full and ideal protection, but people in the general public who receive a single vaccine dose tend to behave as if they are suddenly invincible, not realizing how imperfect the protection is until they receive the booster.

As as health care worker, the nurse in the article was the primary risk factor for her family to become infected;  the rest of the family was not in risky situations.  If you protect the potential disease vectors first, the network effect of stopping entire transmission chains is far more effective than trying to get a little bit of imperfect protection to everyone.  

If the infection had occurred two weeks later, and if the nurse in question had received two doses of the vaccine, it's likely zero infections would have occurred.  If her family each only received one immunization, it's entirely possible all of the infections would have still occurred.

This is doubly true if all of the imperfectly-protected people go out and #yolo believing they are suddenly fully immune - suddenly, you've created an actively worse problem than the one you were trying to solve.

The size of the countries does matter, thus it's hard to draw conclusions from comparing Israel to countries the size of US or China. But Israel has a similar population to that of Switzerland, Belgium, Sweden, Austria, Greece and Portugal. And even in absolute numbers Israel has vaccinated more than Germany, Canada, Italy, UK, Russia and France. 

50% of the Israeli population doesn't serve for different reasons (most Arabs don't serve, and religious women don't serve for example, as are physically and mentally challenged individuals). There is little trust between Israel and it's current leader with 4 elections in 2 years and an indictment against him.

It's about a mentality of urgency and rallying together in times of danger that stems from it's threatened existence, and the fact that Netenyahu is pretty damn good when he wants something done (which is not often).",,,1610158785,{},gim2yxd,False,t3_ksykg2,False,False,t1_gijwrf1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ksykg2/israels_covid_vaccine_rollout_is_the_fastest_in/gim2yxd/,1610201885,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Have found that we have more deaths than we would expect.  In fact they found that an additional 30 percent or people have died.

So something has killed about half a million Americans and if you think all the doctors and virologists are conspiring because of “reasons” something is still killing them.

&gt;A report released by the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy and National Governors Association in December cited 20 states that are considering recruiting non-traditional providers, including students, dentists, veterinarians and paramedics.

&gt;On Monday, the California Department of Consumer Affairs approved an emergency waiver allowing dentists to administer Covid-19 vaccines. The move came as California Governor Gavin Newsom announced the state's plans to aggressively accelerate the pace of vaccination.

&gt;The American Dental Association says dentists are cleared to give the vaccine in multiple states, including Oregon, where the first dentist in the US to administer a Covid-19 vaccine did so last month.

&gt;Dr. William Reynolds, president of the American Optometric Association, says optometrists are an untapped resource in the vaccination effort.

&gt;The association says 19 states allow optometrists to administer medicine via injection -- and in California, they can administer flu and shingles vaccines -- but aren't authorized to give the Covid-19 vaccine specifically.

&gt;Reynolds noted that optometrists are widely distributed and ready to jump in to help smaller and rural communities that may need help.

They (Chinese researchers) published the sequence on January 5.  It would not be until Jan 24th that the CDC would publish the above linked sample.

And then, once the US data was available it was compared...and found identical.  Which is also unsurprising as that case is believed to have acquired the virus during travel in China.

If they're identical -- and they were -- it makes no difference which sample you're basing diagnostics and vaccines on...because they're identical.

As noted in the CDC paper, ""The SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 viral strain described above has been deposited into BEI reagent resources (ATCC) and the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA, UTMB) to serve as the SARS-CoV-2 reference strain for the United States. The SARS-CoV-2 fourth passage virus has been sequenced and maintains a nucleotide sequence identical to that of the original US clinical strain. These deposits make it available to the domestic and international public health, academic, and pharmaceutical sectors for basic research, diagnostic development, antiviral testing, and vaccine development."", the CDC considers this the official reference copy of the virus as first seen in the US.

The details of the decisions of the vaccine manufacturers as to their specific vaccine designs aren't necessarily public knowledge.  Presumably some of, at a minimum, their rationale for some decisions they made would be proprietary.  Nonetheless, to suggest that any of their decisions is tainted by Chinese data is not supported by any data I've seen.

""Reasons for the lack of commercial and effective vaccines for SARS and  MERS are varied. In the case of MERS, it is likely that the vaccine  development was delayed because of the scarcity of suitable and  cost-effective small animal models during pre-clinical experimentation.  In addition, it is probable that a vaccine has not been delivered  because of the low interest in investing in a vaccine for a disease that  has produced relatively low and geographically centralized cases  (compared with other more global and persistent infectious diseases such  as influenza, HIV and tuberculosis). This last factor might have also  contributed to the lack of a vaccine for SARS, in the sense that it was  considered pointless to continue investing in a vaccine for a disease  whose cases ceased to be reported in 2004.""

2) Corona viruses also mutate slowly

""Vaccine researchers were fortunate with SARS-CoV-2 in many respects,  says Iwasaki. The virus doesn’t mutate a lot or have effective  strategies for foiling the human immune system, she says, unlike HIV,  herpes or even influenza. The herpes virus, by contrast, has more  evasion capability — it actively blocks antibodies from binding, which  makes it harder to find an effective agent against it. And the fast  mutation of flu viruses requires a different vaccine formulation for  every flu season.""

Granted that it may be ""valid"" for the Oxford one, and probably less risks would be present in having (reasonable) delays.

By the scary part is that I assume the bulk of vaccines mentioned by US are probably Pfizer and the UK did not distinguish between Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca when commissioning delays.

I think a good analogy could be: Oxford vaccine might be untested with a longer administration of 3 weeks, but if we compare traditional vaccines to a tablespoon, the Oxford vaccine might be a teaspoon.. might be a tablespoon (size reference for effectiveness)

The Pfizer one is neither. It is a fork. It is still a piece of cutlery (vaccine), it may still be fine for eating a cake with it like a spoon, but it can't be compared with ""other vaccines"" fully when predicting an outcome if you're changing the variables (in this case time between doses).

Restaurants are still packed most evenings, you just can’t sit more than four at a table. Many cram schools have been allowed to remain open, you just can’t have more than 9 kids in the classroom. Taekwondo and other similar sport centers have been allowed to remain in operation, though gyms are closed. I believe saunas are still open and many churches have continued to function. Most people are required to go to work in person still.


I think people have been a bit more careful over the last few weeks though, and there were no large New Years celebrations. Christmas is also not really a family holiday event here either. Mask wearing is still huge here, anecdotally I haven’t seen a person in public without a mask since last February (though some people do wear them incorrectly or take them off to sneeze or spit).

The long term consequences of this virus. A significant portion of survivors have long COVID and we have no idea how to help them. Some don’t and seemingly clear the virus, sure, but we also don’t know whether the virus lays dormant, like chicken pox and then resurfaces decades later, like shingles.

My point is, you’re doing this for *you* just as much as the elderly who are more at risk of death right now. 2. The more people who get the virus, the more it mutates. It might not be deadly for our demographic now, but that could change as millions and millions of people continue to get it, which just prolongs this crisis and steals even more of our youth.

This is because Cuba recognizes a right to health care and recognizes healthy people are free people. 

You want to be upset because a few decades ago, there was a revolution that forced wealthy slave owning conservatives to flee to the US. But I don't actually care about wealthy slave owners. You do.

The US has a higher per capita homeless rate, the US is more illiterate, and USians are far more likely to go hungry.

There's very few human rights metrics in which the US outperforms Cuba.

It's a risk. I'm not arguing that there isn't a potential benefit. I want this to end too. But we can't leave the virus able to infect people that have been vaccinated if it is at all possible to avoid that. The key to that will be getting that second dose as soon as possible.

What I want to know is, where do we expect to get the second dose if they never hold any back for that purpose? I don't see manufacturing being able to go any faster than it is now. So unless there's a miracle or a pause in demand, we *could* be stuck for awhile with only one dose, which means potentially more silent carriers, which does nothing to help those that are unable to be vaccinated or those that have to wait for vaccination.

Now if someone in the know on these issues says ""we have a guarantee that production and distribution will ramp up so everyone can get a second dose in a timely manner"", then I *might* be less hesitant. At least someone is accountable in that situation.

It's not disingenuous to question this. There's a real concern that instead of having good protection we could have mediocre or worse protection. In that scenario, we're not necessarily better off. Sure, *probably* fewer deaths and hospitalizations. But we also know that this virus has other side effects for a lot of people.
