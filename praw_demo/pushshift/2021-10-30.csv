Catholics questioning the legitimacy of the pope are by definition not Catholics. 

If someone is claiming a religious exemption as a Catholic, it should be denied on the basis that the religion (the pope is an extension of God) has urged its followers to get the vaccine.

&gt;After suffering intermittent waves of outbreaks, Ruili has imposed some of the most stringent domestic travel restrictions in China, including self-funded quarantine of at least seven days at centralised facilities for those wishing to leave the city for non-urgent matters.

&gt;People are going through a very difficult time,"" the city's Communist Party said in a statement, citing Ruili's Vice Mayor Yang Mou at a news conference.

&gt;”It is necessary to continue with a strict policy on leaving the city to make sure ... the virus control situation in the whole province and in the whole country are not affected,"" Yang said.

&gt;The controls on departures were temporary and would be adjusted according to the epidemic situation, Yang said, without giving a timeline.

&gt;As parts of the world reopen and prepare to live with COVID-19, China is clinging to zero-tolerance, priding itself for largely stamping out the virus within its borders while the disease rages on in other countries and new variants surface.

&gt;Illegal crossings of infected people from Myanmar are a problem for Ruili's zero-virus goal, which is not helped by a lack of natural barriers such as mountains, Yin Zhongde, another vice mayor of Ruili, told the briefing.

&gt;Since Oct. 1, Ruili has reported two domestic symptomatic cases and 17 asymptomatic infections, while more than 20% of people recently returning from abroad had tested positive, Ruili's mayor Shang Labian was quoted as saying.

So in order to avoid people waiting and fighting for better vaccine, China choose to only give Chinese made vaccines to everyone.  That's how China was able to get close to 75% of people fully vaccinated.

Sure, Chinese inactivated vaccine is inferior compared to mRNA in term of efficacy against infection, but it is still very good in term of efficacy against severe disease/death since t-cell isotopes have not changed at all in all variants.  Guess what.  All vaccines are inefficient against infection as time goes by (maybe four months for sinovac, six months for Pfizer and eight or nine months for Moderna).  

It depends the goal. If the goal is to prevent any severe disease/death, Chinese inactivated vaccines work just fine.  But if the goal is to prevent any infection, right now we don't have any vaccine in the market that can do that.

You are confusing efficacy against infection vs efficacy against severe disease/death.

All vaccines are still very efficacy against serious disease/death, even delta since t-cell isotopes for SAR-COVID2 has not changed at all in alpha, beta and other variants.

Then we are talking about efficacy against infection.  In this case, Chinese inactivate vaccine is inferior product compared to mRNA.

But guess what, all vaccines reduce efficacy against infection overtime due to waning immunity and infectious of Delta variant.

Duh. But COVID doesn't just kill unhealthy people. It has a preference for sure, but no one is really safe from it. Someone can be overweight for 30 years and still live to the average life expectancy without medical intervention. There is no comparison between being overweight and catching COVID.

Comparing COVID to heart disease or cancer is like comparing apples to kumquats.

If you have heart disease, it's not going to affect your neighbor. Cancer is like 30 diseases lumped under a single umbrella, so it's not really a fair comparison. 

It's also pretty jarring when a disease comes out of nowhere and becomes the #3 cause of death within a period of a year. Cancer and heart disease have been around for millions of years, they're practically part of being human. You can't compare this to global pandemics like the 1918 flu or COVID; these are the kind of things that can cause extinction level events. There was a pandemic 33 million years ago that lasted 15 million years and affected practically all mammals on the planet.

It's really common for schools where I am to ajoin a public access park, and we didn't even have the biggest.

About 1/3 is surfaced playground with 2 play structures, 5 basketball courts, 3 volleyball courts, and 2vtennis courts. The rest was grass with 4 baseball fields ( little league plays on them), and a soccer/field hockey field. 

Back then it was a combined elementary and middle school with a student population of 1000+ kids, and 36 classrooms. 4 years after I left they capped class sizes at 32 and a separate middle school was opened and 6-8 graders from 2 combination schools were moved there.

Today the student pop at my old school is in the high 600s and the new middle school serves about 900 kids.

I now live about 3 miles from that school, and am zoned for the school my husband went to and the middle school I mentioned above. 

Both have playgrounds that are at least double the size you are questioning.

The elementary school playground has a 2 mile walking path, 3 play structures, 2 basketball courts, and a Pokemon gym. 

The middle school playground is big enough to host motocross events. It shares a campus with a complex of other city services. This complex used to be the old high school and the old football field/track ajoins the middle school fields. These two combined fields are big enough that a small plane can make an emergency landing there ( happened once when I was 15ish).

There are several other schools in district that are even bigger.

One has a 15 acre park, 12 baseball fields  3 pools and a splash pad. 

The biggest is the district early intervention school, that serves around 50 kids from age 2 to 5 and kids/adults with a mental age of 6 or less. It is assigned a 31 acre park with two handicap accessible playgrounds, a small concert pavilion, 5 soccer fields,  8 baseball diamonds, a splash pad and a 1.2 acre pond.

The 4 highschools all these kids end up at have about 7000 kids each. All told, there are 16 schools in the district.

A CA founding family owns the property all these schools sit on (along with half the town-everyone would 100% recognize the name if I was willing to dox myself more than I already am)

We did have 2 additional schools which have closed down in the last ten years because moving kids to portable classrooms at other campuses is cheaper than renovating unsafe buildings. 

The one closest to my house, one without a public park attached, was knocked down and replaced by 184 single-family townhouses.

The other one did have a small park and was rebuilt as a community center.

As a side note, kids on these huge campuses do not necessarily get to just go anywhere in the parks at recess. We were given boundaries, but teachers could take kids anywhere on the grounds and still be on campus.",,,,1635666727,{},hiqp2m6,False,t3_qj1oxt,False,True,t1_hiq94yd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qj1oxt/covid19_has_killed_more_people_in_the_us_than/hiqp2m6/,1635867280.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brighter news. Progress on a range of areas related to #COVID19. Today 90% of adults are fully vaccinated with 92.5% partially. Hospitalisations are trending downwards. 329 in hospital, 54 in ICU. Overall testing positivity reducing but high volumes in schools still. @HSELive

https://twitter.com/paulreiddublin/status/1436235157464391684?s=20

And as for high volume in school, it doesn’t really matter because the most important thing is to avoid hospitalization and death. We also have data from across the world, which shows most deaths coming from the unvaccinated. It’s also proven to slow spread.

https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/data-outlook/the-state-of-state-level-breakthrough-case-reporting

This is data from Johns Hopkins, which supports the fact that 99% of deaths are unvaccinated, and that spread is reduced through vaccination.

As I sat and watched my state's own lack of response of any manner while Delta ripped through it, I wondered this same thing. Basically, ""power through"" the wave and build a natural immunity amongst the population who, quite honestly, wasn't going to get vaccinated, wear masks, and will ignore any other public safety measure that wasn't strictly enforced by law anyways. At least this way schools were open, the economy wasn't crippled (especially for a state like FL that relies on tourism), and life *could* be somewhat normal. Especially for our young children, who are in the lowest risk group if they contracted the virus anyways.

The question is: At what cost? Here's the way I've personally approached the pandemic all along: It's inevitable that we're all going to get this disease at some point. It was always destined to be endemic. The *goal* is to delay getting it as long as possible. This is especially true for the population who won't get vaccinated. They specifically want to delay as long as possible so therapeutics can be developed and come to market and we can understand as much as possible about the virus so we can better treat it.

I will never forgive our former President for how he politicized a public health crisis. He was in the perfect position to preach personal accountability. Which, coincidentally, is what the unvaccinated population should be most concerned with. Not going to get the vaccine? Fine. Mask up, social distance, and take other measures to prolong contracting the virus for the above stated reasons.

With the original strain of COVID there was a study that included  71,000 people hospitalized with COVID.  50% were obese. 28% were overweight.  Total of 78%.  So that's how many were overweight and hospitalized.  According to the CDC a model shows that 30.2% of all Americans hospitalized up til November of 2020 could be attributed to obesity. In March 2021 CDC reports for hospitalization, icu admission , and death were lowest with people with a BMI under 25.9.  rates increased sharply with higher bmis.

After about 6 months the effectiveness of the shots drop to under 50% after 6 months.

Risk of hypertension in overweight people  increases 40-60%
Risk of chd is 50% higher in overweight.

Obesity increases severe risk of severe illness and triples  the risk of hospitalization from covid 

A study back in April 2020 reported obesity doubles the risk hospitalization from covid of patients over 60

A study out if Canada with almost 400,000 people found that those with obesity were 113% more likely to be hospitalized with COVID, 74% more likey to need intensive care, 48% more likely to die than those with lower BMIs

10 of eleven studies shows an increased mortality rate from covid in patients that are overweight

Being overweight is one of the top 10 risk factor for strokes and associated with almost 1 in 5 strokes. It increases your risk of strokes by 22%  and if you are obese it's 64%.  

There was a study in 2020 that stated that people who were obese had a 46% increased risk for COVID 19 infection.  The study also found there was a 74% increase in number of deaths in people when were obese compared to those who aren't obese. Obesity contributes to low resistance from infections.

I like looking up stats.  

I can find more.

Also if you look at studies the vaccines are slightly less effective in overweight people.  It's typically only a couple percent.  But still less effective.

Over 80% of people with chd (coronary heart disease) are overweight or obese.

You increase pay for those then.  I hope you can see where that goes.  The cost of everything will go up.  Now I will admit I am a little selfish.  I work in a nursing home.

I'm not looking to make prices go up.  I already effectively make less than when I started due to inflation and my property taxes going up.  I don't want it to be any worse. By next year my taxes will have gone up about $120 per month from just last year.

The state as a whole, even as of just this month, is still only hovering a bit over 50% of their population being fully vaccinated - which means they have been and will continue to be lagging behind in their vaccine efforts. Increasing 27% from a catastrophically low number is of course better than being where they once were, but that still means they went from catastrophically low to just regular low / low-average. Delta got them in a chokehold and killed a bunch of vulnerable people in a short period of time because that's what Delta does in severely under-vaccinated places. India is a good example of that from their horrific peak in the spring and still maintaining low case numbers, even though their vaccine rates aren't amazing (worse than FL.)

And the U.K can't and shouldn't be compared to that because they have always had high vaccine rates. That means they'll see a slow burn of cases going up and down, but they never saw a drastic peak and fall that accompanies an ICU shortage (like FL) because people were vaccinated, so their death and hospitalization rates have still been steadily low since the spring.",,,,1635700875,{},hisa535,False,t3_qjg6qv,False,True,t1_his2f3o,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qjg6qv/colorado_could_move_to_crisis_standards_of_care/hisa535/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,3bcf1e20d2f5312ff7711c93e9e5a01915654e89,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1635700888.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Your shot is only that effective for...not even six months,. The effectiveness drops to under 50% by then.  So natural immunity is perfectly sensible for people who have recovered from covid. Now would I recommend someone go try to catch COVID. No. That would be idiotic. 

Natural immunity isn't perfect. You can get the virus a second time. But Israel says natural immunity has a longer lasting and stronger protection against infection and hospitalization. 

They did a study in israel with 16215 people each vaccinated and with natural immunity.  They said that cases in the vaccinated group were 13 fold more likely to experience a breakthrough infection than the natural immunity group. 8 vaccinated went to the hospital.  1 with natural immunity did.

&gt;I am not aware of any study which looks at infections in a similar way to vaccine trials — i.e. reinfection must be confirmed 

If this is what you are after, the best info probably comes from the trials themselves. The [Pfizer submission to CDC](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download) describes (p 13) two primary endpoints: first they analyze vaccine efficacy for subjects without any past Covid, then they analyze efficacy for people WITH OR WITHOUT past Covid, as measured (I think) by nucleocapsid antibodies in the first visit.

Table 6 and Table 7 list the # of cases for both sets. When you include people with past infections the Covid cases vaccine group increases from 8 to 9, but for the placebo group it increases from 162 to 169. At face value this suggests the vaccine is better than past infection, with two caveats that (1) ""past infection"" may have been 6 months ago and may have waned;  (2)  I am not sure how they handled subjects with missing data and if they are included in Table 6 or 7 (missing serological data is reported in Table 5 as being 2.2% of subjects).

There is probably similar data in the Moderna submission, but I didn't look. I've read through much of the Pfizer submission in the past, but with the lens of an interested consumer rather than a regulator or peer reviewer, so it's possible I am missing something here. 

Finally, it's a different product, but I've always found the Novavax data striking and it may more directly answer your question. See [Table 2](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2103055) of this paper. For the beta variant, patients who were seropositive at baseline were NOT better protected despite past infection. The vaccine did not do amazing (50% efficacy) either. While vaccine vs placebo was randomized, seropositive vs negative obviously is not and you might speculate that subjects who were seropositive were more likely to engage in risky behaviors -- but still, the absence of any signal from past infection is striking and disappointing. Novavax made a big deal about this in their press release and it gave me a sinking feeling when I read the news myself (like, if past infections don't protect us, that's a pretty bad sign for the world).",,,,1635719789,{},hithqo2,False,t3_qijvsb,False,True,t1_hirtk20,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qijvsb/vaccination_protects_against_covid19_more/hithqo2/,1635925056.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Throughout the pandemic, I did what I could by masking up, following the restrictions and getting the vaccination as soon as I could...as I was lucky enough to live in a country where I had early access to the vaccine. But all along I wished that I could do more to help. 

With this fundraiser, that's finally posssible. We can finally do something to directly help other people get their vaccinations. Each $5 donation will pay for one vaccination in a lower income country.

There’s a vaccine against the flu. Not everyone gets it or is forced to, yet numbers of thousands of ppl die annually from it. It’s not front page on the news, but people die. Vaccination against it is recommended, but no one is cramming it down anyone’s throat, but healthcare professionals recommend it every season because they’re required to.

I don’t know, but highly suspect there was similar controversy surrounding the flu vaccines. I haven’t researched it, but hen again, that was a season when people were more trusting; there wasn’t the advent of what’s now the “information age,” and ppl question health care professionals and doctors much more today. 

Yes. Covids’ R0 transmission is greater, but the concept of vaccination remains the same, and for the most part, people haven’t changed with regard to free will.  

People know what isn’t good for them, but, they do it anyway. It’s human nature.

Even if you stack up the logic and statistics before them, there’s now enough access to information and conspiracy theories that attempts to refute the benefits of the covid vaccine, so people choose to believe it. 

It’s all what you feed your brain, where your influences lie and what your biases are. Lemmings are going to be lemmings. Regardless of which camp they’re ascribing to.

The thing is the ordinary person doesn't know which science to trust, and news feeds publish bad 'science' all the time which gets liked, shared, commented and upvoted before someone blows it apart and shows how sloppy, clickbait or misleading the study is. 

And perhaps even worse, actual facts are pushed in ways that completely misconstrue the data. For example if you're seeing news all day of people having reactions to vaccines, that's a scientific fact. But what it's doing is taking the .0001% fringe cases and making them look like half of the picture. Reddit does this too with many things that can be proven as scientific facts but presented in extremely disproportionate ways.

If you run a front page headline everyone dies to a shark attack you can make everyone thing shark attacks are on the rise, or some new concern. When someone questions this you can point to all the headlines and say it's all proven facts and this person is a fool for ignoring it. Here's proof that it happened! The truth is we have been all been ignoring shark attack numbers our whole lives because they don't affect us.

And as for the mRNA itself, that's an interesting bit. People have sequenced the mRNA from the vaccine. We know the exact bases that make them up. And the interesting thing is that, although there are slight differences between the 2 mRNA sequences, in the end they produce the exact same product. Essentially, there is a mapping table that the ribosomes in your cells use to translate RNA codons (ie: base pair triplets sequences) into amino acids. You can see the mapping table here:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA\_and\_RNA\_codon\_tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_and_RNA_codon_tables)

As you see there, there are 6 different codons that all map to same Leucine amino acid. Well, if you run both the Moderna and Pfizer mRNA through that mapping process, although there are differences in the input, the spike proteins that are output will be 100% identical. It's sort of like the difference between turning left 180 degrees vs turning right 180 degrees. They'll put you in the same orientation.

(note: there is one other slight difference. At the end of the mRNA there is a small section that instructs the body on how many copies of the spike to make. Think of it as a multiplier factor: \[total dose\] = \[# of mRNA strands injected\] \* \[number of copies each one makes\]. I believe there was a slight difference between the 2 vaccines in this regard)

&gt; All three mRNA vaccines encode a form of the coronavirus spike protein, which helps virus particles to penetrate human cells.

This is thought to circumvent the body’s inflammatory reactions to foreign mRNA. CureVac’s vaccine uses normal uridine and relies on altering the sequence of RNA letters in a way that does not affect the protein it codes for, but helps the vaccine to evade immune detection.

&gt;Mayor Bill de Blasio says overall, 91% of city workers are now vaccinated.

&gt;The NYPD has increased its vaccinated members to 84%. Fire and EMS both increased to 72% and 84% respectively. The Department of Sanitation has 77% of employees with at least one shot, a 10% jump from Friday.

&gt;Pushback to the mandate is heating up with both mayoral candidates battling each other on the issue.

&gt;Denis Boyle’s West Brighton home overlooks a firehouse, where neighbors fear the vaccine mandate stand off already hits home.

&gt;“I’d be worried if they were short-staffed,” Boyle told CBS2’s Dave Carlin.

&gt;FDNY is confirming some of its units, but not entire firehouses, are temporarily shut down. CBS2 wanted to know which units and did not get the answers.

&gt;What this likely does to emergency response troubles neighbors.

&gt;“If there’s not enough guys to come, God forbid somebody has a heart attack or if they’re not able to get there and have enough guys take care of it,” Boyle said.

&gt;“That’s dangerous,” West Brighton resident Daniel Lugo said. “I don’t want to see people lose their lives or even other firemen because they didn’t have the back-up that they needed.”

&gt;As we get closer to Monday, tensions rise that more firehouses become dangerously short-staffed.

&gt;Vaccinate or lose your paycheck when the weekend ends is a deadline that angers some firefighters, police officers, sanitation workers and others.

&gt;The city claims this has already prompted sick-outs, especially among firefighters, some believed to be taking medical leave in protest.

&gt;Candidates for mayor Eric Adams and Curtis Sliwa made the mandate the main topic at Saturday campaign stops.

&gt;Adams wants better communication with unions but said vaccinations come with certain jobs.

&gt;“We took an oath of office to protect the city. I wore that uniform as a police officer. We were all first responders. Let’s put the people of the city first,” Adams said. “I think it’s imperative for the mayor to resolve this issue with the union leadership and get this done.”

&gt;Sliwa, fresh from his Friday pedestrian accident involving a cab, called the mandates “incredibly oppressive” and an insult to essential workers.

&gt;“I know it’s gonna be horrific on Monday,” Sliwa said.

&gt;He visited firehouses to tell those working in them that the mandates must go and Gov. Kathy Hochul must go over the mayor’s head to roll them back.

&gt;“She should do the right thing or New York City will be in peril,” Sliwa said. “You can imagine less firefighters, less response, potentially people killed.”

After all that’s gone on, the ones at highest risk ARE the unvaccinated. Why exclude them from vaccinated people if they’ve taken precautions to try to protect themselves. 

This has become a “club of exclusivity” at this point.  We’re all still capable of carrying covid, and all still susceptible to getting sick (vaccinated and unvaccinated alike) just like with the flu. 

In the hospitals, we’re still seeing the unvaccinated and the very old (vaccinated) being admitted with covid… and yes, some are still dying.  

This is going to continue (just like the flu), but vaccines have certainly reduced the number of deaths and the numbers being admitted to and dying in the hospital. 

Just let people have freedom of choice. 

Some will vaccinate, some won’t.  

Some unvaccinated will get sick and recover, and some will get sick and die.  

Some vaccinated will get sick and recover, and some will get sick and die.

Developed countries tend to have an ageing population compared to developing countries. India/African countries etc generally are much younger than us on average.  And we know older you are more at risk you are. 

Although I'd also be very careful when comparing death figures since surveillance will vary depending on the country. Most of Africa simply don't have the resources compared to the US or UK to detect covid cases/deaths. Like in Africa South Africa has 89k official covid deaths but their neighbours in comparison like Zimbabwe has just below 5k covid deaths or Nigeria which has a much higher population has below 3k covid deaths. Given that South Africa is one the more wealthier African countries not all surprising on paper that they have the highest death rate in Africa since i bet all their neighbours simply aren't counting all covid deaths due to lack of resources. 

And even then it looks like South Africa may even be missing covid deaths since there has been 267k excess deaths since May [2020](https://www.samrc.ac.za/reports/report-weekly-deaths-south-africa). And this article also seems to suggest we simply don't know the true [figures](https://www.theigc.org/blog/why-we-dont-know-the-real-number-of-covid-19-deaths-in-africa/).

Now we’re talking about a third shot. It’s honestly getting redundant - realistically, how many shots are we going to need?

The city of Chicago will only lift its local mandate when there are fewer than 200 recorded Covid-19 cases per day, versus the 245 it’s recording now on average, and the city’s health commissioner said Monday it will stay in place for “at least another couple of weeks.” https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/10/20/some-mask-mandates-lifted-where-covid-19-cases-are-falling/",,,,1635706901,{},hisogri,False,t3_qiw0up,False,True,t1_hisl81w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qiw0up/daily_discussion_thread_october_30_2021/hisogri/,1635909820.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It would be very difficult to mount a legal argument that someone being fat is a impinging on the freedoms of other citizens. Yeah, it costs us more as a society, but show me the part of the Constitution where the right to not pay for the stupidity of others is protected. The state/federal government can control limited aspects of our diet, like any food served by a state institution has to be nutritious. The government can limit the sale and transport of foods like trans fats and HFCS because of commerce controls.

&gt;Rolling out vaccines during a pandemic is not easy, and people can get confused by evidence that shows COVID vaccines don't work perfectly, including a study yesterday showing that household spread with the Delta (B1617.2) variant still happens after vaccination, albeit not as readily in the unvaccinated and not leading to severe cases (see today's CIDRAP News story).

&gt;Yet the body of evidence continues to grow that, despite their imperfections, COVID-19 vaccines continue to work very well, and today's study adds to that. Officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), who led the study, say of the results, ""All eligible persons should be vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as possible, including unvaccinated persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.""

&gt;Unvaccinated at 5.5 times the risk

&gt;The researchers looked at data from nine states on 201,269 hospitalizations for COVID-like illness from Jan 1 to Sep 2, 2021. Of these, 94,264 had molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2, and 7,348 (7.8%) had lab-confirmed COVID-19. Among that group, 1,020 hospitalizations were among previously infected and unvaccinated people, and 6,328 cases were among fully vaccinated people who were not previously infected.

&gt;Lab-confirmed COVID-19 was found in 324 (5.1%) of the fully vaccinated people and in 89 (8.7%) of the unvaccinated, previously infected people.

&gt;In comparing unvaccinated people who were infected 90 to 179 days after a previous infection compared with those who were vaccinated 90 to 179 days before their COVID infection, the researchers found the incidence of infection to be 5.49 times higher in the unvaccinated (95% confidence interval, 2.75 to 10.99).

&gt;The authors conclude, ""These findings suggest that among hospitalized adults with COVID-19–like illness whose previous infection or vaccination occurred 90–179 days earlier, vaccine-induced immunity was more protective than infection-induced immunity against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.""

&gt;Daily cases near 100,000

&gt;In what could be an anomaly, the United States reported 99,384 new cases yesterday and 1,776 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. The day before officials noted 76,957 new COVID-19 cases and 2,141 deaths. All told, the country now has had 45,892,544 COVID cases and 744,955 deaths.

&gt;The 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is 72,569, with 1,381 daily deaths, according to the New York Times tracker.

&gt;And the CDC COVID Data Tracker shows that 57.8% of Americans are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 66.5% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 8.7% of fully vaccinated people have received a booster dose.

&gt;Pandemic economic impact

&gt;Hamstrung by COVID-19 and supply shortages, the US economy slowed sharply to a 2% annual growth rate in July through September, the lowest quarterly growth since the recovery from the pandemic recession began last year, the Associated Press reported.

&gt;In other industry news, the Biden administration's vaccine mandate for private-sector employers will allow companies to force workers who refuse to get the COVID-19 vaccine to pay for required weekly tests and masks, Bloomberg News reports.

&gt;New York City is bracing for a shortage of police and firefighters as its COVID vaccination deadline approaches today, according to the New York Times. And Citigroup says that US-based employees must submit proof of COVID vaccination by Jan 14 if they want to stay employed, according to CNN.",,,,1635716330,{},hitahh8,True,t3_qjzcbw,False,True,t3_qjzcbw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qjzcbw/covid19_vaccine_gives_5_times_the_protection_of/hitahh8/,1635921398.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;The amusement park will be closed Nov. 1 and 2, with no guarantee of reopening after then, although some hotels within the resort will remain open. The news of the temporary closure on Sunday followed an announcement earlier that day that the park was suspending entries.

&gt;The park did not specify the reason for the announcements, except to say that it had received notice from other provinces and cities and was cooperating with their epidemiological investigations. China has raced since mid-October to contain a fresh outbreak tied to domestic tourists, which has so far infected more than 370 people across at least 11 provinces and regions. On Sunday, the National Health Commission reported 48 new locally transmitted cases in the previous 24 hours, though none in Shanghai.

&gt;Guests leaving the resort would need to be tested for the coronavirus, followed by another one 24 hours later, the park’s announcement said. They would then need to self-monitor for 12 days.

&gt;Images on social media showed large groups of workers in full personal protective equipment circulating throughout the park, and long lines of visitors waiting to leave.

&gt;A spokesman for the National Health Commission had said on Saturday that the latest outbreak was “still developing rapidly” and that the situation was “severe and complicated.” The newest round of infections, though small compared to outbreaks in many other countries, is relatively large for China, which has officially reported just about 97,000 cases since the start of the pandemic.

&gt;On the Chinese social media platform Weibo, where the news of the suspension was trending, some commenters who said they had already bought tickets expressed disappointment. But many comments expressed support for the measure and concern about photos of crowds at the park during the Halloween weekend. China’s commitment to a “zero Covid” policy — which has made it an outlier globally — has widespread support domestically, as it has allowed relatively restriction-free travel within the country.

&gt;Still, some experts have warned that the economic toll of repeated lockdowns and other strict prevention measures may eventually become too heavy. Throughout the pandemic, domestic tourism and consumption have suffered when new outbreaks are reported, as people seek to avoid becoming trapped in high-risk areas.",,,,1635714775,{},hit72ca,True,t3_qjyu8v,False,False,t3_qjyu8v,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qjyu8v/shanghai_disneyland_to_close_temporarily_as/hit72ca/,1635919643.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing reports suggesting the coronavirus vaccine made by Moderna can cause heart problems in some adolescents, the company said on Sunday.

&gt;Moderna requested authorization from the F.D.A. for use of its vaccine in children ages 12 to 17 years in June. The adolescents would receive 100 micrograms of the vaccine — the same dose given to adults 18 and above. But the agency has not yet made a ruling on the application, prompting speculation about reasons for the delay.

&gt;In a statement on Sunday, Moderna said the F.D.A. “requires additional time to evaluate recent international analyses of the risk of myocarditis after vaccination.”

&gt;The European Medicines Agency approved the vaccine for use in adolescents in July. But since then, several European countries have paused the vaccine’s use in people 30 and younger, citing concerns about myocarditis — an inflammation of the heart muscle.

&gt;Moderna said more than 1.5 million adolescents worldwide have received its coronavirus vaccine, and the data thus far do not suggest an increased risk of myocarditis. But studies from Israel and the United States have linked both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines to rare and transient cases of myocarditis, with a higher risk from the Moderna vaccine.

&gt;The F.D.A. notified Moderna on Friday that it would need more time to assess the vaccine’s safety and may not deliver a decision until January 2022, the company said in a statement on Sunday. The agency took roughly a month to authorize the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children ages 12 to 15 years. That vaccine has been available to adolescents in the United States and Europe since May.

&gt;Even with the heightened risk, myocarditis as a result of the vaccine is rare, mild, and resolves quickly, noted Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the F.D.A.’s vaccine advisory committee.

&gt;Covid-19 is much more likely to cause myocarditis, Dr. Offit noted, because the virus can infect and damage the lining of the heart. “That would be the decision point I would make for my child,” he said.

&gt;In studies from Israel and the United States, the incidence of heart problems among people who had received Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine is highest in males aged 16 to 29 years. The risk appears to decline in children 12 to 15, and is expected to be even lower in younger children, Dr. Offit said.

&gt;The F.D.A. in July asked Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna to enroll more children in their clinical trials in order to detect less common side effects. Last week, after reviewing data from a clinical trial of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in children aged 5 through 11 years, the F.D.A. authorized the vaccine for that age group.

&gt;Results from Pfizer’s vaccine trial in children under 5 are not expected till the fourth quarter of this year at the earliest. Last week, Moderna said its vaccine produced a potent immune response in children ages 6 through 11 who received half the adult dose. The company plans to request authorization from the F.D.A. for the vaccine’s use in this age group.",,,,1635714402,{},hit68ov,True,t3_qjypnc,False,False,t3_qjypnc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qjypnc/the_fda_is_assessing_whether_the_moderna_vaccine/hit68ov/,1635919223.0,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,paxinfernum,,,[],,,,text,t2_5nakr3py,False,True,[],"Engineers and medical doctors actually are some of the most prone to conspiracy ideation. There are several reasons why.

1. They're trained in science fields, but they're not really trained in science. They're taught the products of science, and they utilize simplified understandings of scientific principles, but they themselves aren't actually good at formulating scientific knowledge. This workman attitude toward science translates into their lack of epistemic uncertainty. They're used to using scientific principles in unambiguous or low ambiguity situations. Real scientists say ""I don't know"" all the time because they understand how much the answer to any question just comes down to ""It depends.""

2. They tend to be more conservative and religious. Often, engineering is seen as an alternative to becoming a scientist for people who fear becoming one of the ""liberal elite."" Back when I taught science, the kids from conservative households who were into STEM wanted to be engineers. I figure their parents could stomach that, whereas they'd be upset about them becoming scientists. Becoming an engineer and build trains and planes is seen as manly and rugged. Engineers themselves often sneer at theoreticians and self-praise their do-with-it-ness. Doctors are similar. While they're evenly split between liberal and conservative, they lean more conservative than biologists. They are also seen as ""hands-on"" workers, more like a skilled trade than those damn ""pointy-headed poindexters.""

3. Geology is another example of a STEM discipline that's filled with conservatives due to the oil and natural gas industry, and surprise surprise, it's filled with Young Earth Creationist and conspiracies about how oil is actually not generated by fossils but by natural processes deep within the Earth. Why? Because of religion. The overlap between engineering and medical science and Christianity also can't be understated. They tend to be the most religious of all the STEM disciplines, and religion cultivates the rejection of critical thinking in order to build an alternative reality based on conjecture and cherry-picked arguments. Religion is basically a conspiracy theory about how the universe is secretly run by this dude who's fighting an evil army. As a last note, the connection between engineering and terrorism is also established in the literature. Among Al-Qaeda cells, engineers are more prominent than would be suggested by their level in the general population. This seems to have nothing to do with the need for bomb builders since the kinds of bombs they're building don't really require complex engineering.

We know what being politically right means in terms of dealing with Covid/the vaccine, but it seems that if you’re left, you’re expected to go full on out with the fear/over caution even when the actual science says there’s way more of a middle ground afforded to you, ESPECIALLY when you’re vaccinated. 

My wife has been especially anxious throughout the pandemic, and at first, when she was pregnant a month before it all started, obviously it made perfect sense. Pregnant women are highly vulnerable. 

We took big precautions until the vaccines basically. Now our daughter is a year old, all friends and family are vaxxed, we live in a state where it’s a little warmer so we have tons of outdoor activities to do. 

Still, she’ll see some random one-off on TikTok, Snapchat, or Facebook, and I can tell she’s truly anxious about whether or not it’s safe to be outdoors if a group of people is there (a giant apple orchard most recently). Despite all of the evidence that outdoor transmission is like not a thing, AND we are vaccinated, if she reads one stupid headline from whatever social media, or one anecdotal story on FB, then all reason is thrown out the window. To her, that means our little girl is super at risk now. Despite the fact that we’ve been to a wedding that was way mostly vaccinated, I’ve been to a fully vaccinated indoor concert recently, we’ve managed to get through the entire pandemic without getting sick, etc.

She’s prone to anxiety anyway, so I get *why* she does it, but it still makes it frustrating to have to constantly tow the line between being explaining why a headline or study was taken out of context or a little sensationalist (making it look like I’m being anti “science”) and being reasonable with precautions.

BEMER is in talks with NASA about using their technology in space suits. They also have a very popular mat for horses.

His parents booked flights out to visit us for the week before thanksgiving, as my husband is in the Navy and is being pinned as chief that week. We had no idea about their vaccine status until yesterday, and they are fully planning on staying with us and our newborn. Best part is that most hotels in our area require a vaccine card. Oh, and they’re flying here from Arizona, and I saw an article the other day about how Covid is the leading cause of death in AZ now. They think it’s fine because my husband’s sister lives with them, and had a baby a few weeks before us, but the big difference is that our girl was a preemie, who had oxygen issues for the first few days of her life.

I really don’t want his family staying in our house with our preemie newborn after flying from a state that is doing so poorly at handling Covid.

I don’t dispute the efficacy of vaccines. However, I’m of the opinion that everyone is going to do what they believe is safest for them regardless of their reasons (inaccurate or not). Even those immunocompromised are going to do what’s best for them in a world of uncertainty, and if that means cutting people out of their lives who aren’t vaccinated, or admitting people access to their lives because they are, that’s their choice. Masks work despite what “authorities” say, otherwise all the nurses and doctors would be dead who cared for those with Covid. 

Do I think all of this is asinine? Absolutely. However, I’m not going to discriminate people for their lack of knowledge, subscription to the supposed authoritative nay-sayers or other irrational fears.

The vaccine studies only used **CONFIRMED** COVID-19 infections. The SIREN study’s mid-80s number included “possible” reinfections that had no testing and atypical symptoms. When only including “probable” or “confirmed” reinfections, the number was 99%. There were also multiple other reasons the estimate was very low:


[SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of antibody-positive compared with antibody-negative health-care workers in England: a large, multicentre, prospective cohort study (SIREN)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21\)00675-9/fulltext) found about 84% protection, but described this as a minimum, due to multiple caveats that lowered the effect:

1. All but two “reinfections” were classified as “possible”, the remaining two as “probable”, none as “confirmed”. The 84% estimate is based on using all “possible” reinfections.
2. Only about one third of “reinfections” had typical COVID symptoms
3. The authors did not include baseline seronegative people who converted to seropositive as COVID-19 cases
4. The authors found a pattern they indicated seemed consistent with RNA shedding, over counting “reinfections”
The authors note these issues in their paper:

&gt; **Restricting reinfections to probable reinfections only, we estimated that between June and November 2020, participants in the positive cohort had 99% lower odds of probable reinfection, adjusted OR (aOR) 0.01 (95% CI 0.00-0.03). Restricting reinfections to those who were symptomatic we estimated participants in the positive cohort had 95% lower odds of reinfection**, aOR 0.08 (95% CI 0.05-0.13). Using our most sensitive definition of reinfections, including all those who were possible or probable the adjusted odds ratio was 0.17 (95% CI 0.13-0.24).

&gt; A prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an 83% lower risk of infection, with median protective effect observed five months following primary infection. **This is the minimum likely effect as seroconversions were not included.**

&gt; **There were 864 seroconversions in participants without a positive PCR test; these were not included as primary infections in this interim analysis.**

The SIREN study is also not the only study from the “early days” which found these types of results.

[This paper, titled “Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Persist for up to 13 Months and Reduce Risk of Reinfection”](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.07.21256823v3) found about 97% protection from being seropositive:

&gt; Overall, 69 SARS-CoV-2 infections developed in the COVID-19 negative group (incidence of 12.22 per 100 person-years) versus one in the COVID-19 positive group (incidence of 0.40 per 100 person-years), indicating a relative reduction in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection of 96.7%

I mentioned the Cleveland Clinic paper too:

[Cleveland Clinic preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176v2) which found a 100% protective effect.

I was asking if you had a link not because I am unaware, but rather because I have followed this type of research *extremely* closely over the pandemic and I am not aware of any study which looks at infections **in a similar way to vaccine trials — i.e. reinfection must be confirmed** which found what you’re saying.

Obviously people should still choose the vaccine over infection because it’s much safer.

People are still free to choose.

I could equally make the same argument re: the homeless, yet no one is mandating that they get jobs and very few invest their time in educating them. Why is that? Their freedom of choice among other criteria that make them homeless such as illicit drug addiction or alcoholism.  

I’m not saying it’s right or that I agree in either case. I am well aware of the implications. However, it’s still about choice. Should the government or individual organizations choose to mandate that ALL be vaccinated how will that be carried out? Shall we strap them into a restraint and vaccinate against their will? Who will the selfish be in that case? 

People are going to continue to be people, with varying opinions and concerns, idiosyncrasies and quirks, selfishness and self-proclaimed unselfishness, bullies and peacemakers. 

People like to argue and bicker. You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make them drink… the saying has been around for decades, yet so many are still singing the song of insanity: doing the same thing and expecting different results. 

I, for one, am sick of the song and choose not to join the choir. If that makes me a free thinking individual, I’m quite happy to be so.

That's the point I was making, people are incapable of interpreting news cause they lack common sense, and because they are too busy finding random excuses to be skeptical. Let me spell the stuff out for you:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Get vaxx you don’t transmit the virus. You so t need to wear a mask indoors. Don’t have to social distance To you can get others sick. Wear a mask. Social distance still.

The vaccine was never at 100% efficacy even with the alpha variant, so obviously you could get infected and transmit it then - clinical testing already showed that. The vaccine also performed worse vs the Delta, so obviously they would recommend wearing masks indoors because of it, since antivaxxers/anti-masks were spewing their filth everywhere. So, if there is an increased chance of infection due to Delta, common sense says you should wear a mask. It's obvious a mask protects you, but they also outlined that it protect others. This stuff isn't hard to interpret. This is hardly a flip flop, it's just people like you who are completely incapable of critical thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;it said vaxx only shead dead virus. Now to you can be sick and infect others.

Nope, that was never confirmed anywhere. Common sense is that if a vaccine is not a sterilizing vaccine, it means you can get still get infected, even if very mildly, and you can spread it because you're infected. There is a chance even though reduced, that you can be a vector of spread, so to be safe. Mask up. Again common sense.

The CDC didn't flip flop either, the removal of mask mandates was ONLY for fully vaccinated people. Fully vaccinated people still don't need to wear it indoors or outdoors, because the chance of them catching it, is much much lower when they are around fully vaccinated people, but the risk jumps when exposed to unmasked, unvaccinated and potentially highly infected people - These people were required to wear masks. But as you probably noticed, but chose to ignore... a lot of unvaccinated people were unmasked too because there was no way to enforce masks for only unvaccinated people. That increased the chance of infection of both unvaccinated and vaccinated people, and increased the propagation of the virus. This stuff isn't hard to interpret.

Boosters are not required, if you had enough sense to understand what boosters did, you'd know why they are being recommended. Boosters right now are only recommended for people with lower immunity - the booster, boosts active antibodies such that if they do get infected, the active antibodies acts to block infection immediately. THIS DOES NOT MEAN the 2 dose regimen doesn't work! It means if you have a regular immune system, your immune system kicks off faster and produces more antibodies to fight the infection quicker - This is something people with lower immunity cannot do as quickly.

Lastly, wearing masks during at the start of the pandemic was a foregone solution - n95 masks were sold out before the virus even laded in the US. It was obvious what was happening, even the Chinese and Taiwanese had already started wearing it. It was unfortunately the information provided by DTr about the pandemic which caused the suppression of mask recommendations - DTr didn't want to crash the economy, so instead he got 46 million infected and crashed the economy anyway. So if you want to start pointing fingers, you can thank the right for their disastrous leadership and disinformation they continue to spread - this is why the repub1can states got messed up royally during the last delta surge. Also you can thank people like you, who lack basic comprehension skills, and chose to spread vaccine skepticism.

Anyways... I know even after writing this long explanation you'll find some ridiculous reason to shrug it off. Which is why I've lost any hope for the ignorant in this country. If you're incapable of interpreting common senses news, and then choose to misinterpret it and accuse health care professionals of conspiracy, after seeing 744,000 Americans die of COVID, and millions more abroad, you're the problem here, not them. There was no flip flopping, it was all sound science if you actually had the capability of rationalizing the information given to you.",,,,1635630407,{},hioyxoy,False,t3_qigjsw,False,False,t1_hioxpm9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qigjsw/gov_ricketts_bars_state_agencies_from_complying/hioyxoy/,1635833776.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,
