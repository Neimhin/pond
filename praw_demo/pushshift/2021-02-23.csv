The messaging for this has been real bad. The fully vaccinated people are told to wear masks because if they start not wearing them, people who aren't vaccinated will start taking them off prematurely too. Social pressure of everyone wearing a mask around you is effective. That's the main reason that vaccinated people are asked to continue to wear masks, stay 6 feet apart, etc.

But I think the messaging  of why vaccinated people are asked to continue enforce measures is what's wrong. We keep saying things like ""Vaccines don't cut transmission"" which makes people question ""why am I getting vaccinated to begin with?"".

I don't know what the right time to tell people to take off masks for all people is, but we aren't there quite yet. We are back to the summer peak's daily infections/deaths. Once those continue to crater, I fully expect most mandates to be relaxed. I suspect probably in the April-May timeframe? The most vulnerable populations should have their first shot by the end of March and we will see deaths and hospitalizations continue to fall. At that point, it will probably be open season for the general population to get a vaccine appointment and it will be back to normal.",,,1614180501,{},gol9sl7,False,t3_lrcn3y,False,False,t1_gol6qi1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lrcn3y/fda_staff_endorses_johnson_johnsons_singleshot/gol9sl7/,1614329300,29,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;San Francisco-based One Medical has been allocated thousands of vaccine doses by local health departments in some of the areas they provide medical services. Ineligible individuals with connections to company leadership were set up with vaccine appointments, and patients who were disqualified from receiving the vaccine were nonetheless permitted to skip the line ahead of other high-risk patients.

&gt;The problems have occurred in numerous company locations across several states. The Washington State Department of Health, citing a complaint it received this month, told NPR it had halted COVID-19 vaccine distribution to the company. Other regulators have also received complaints or stopped providing the vaccine.

&gt;One Medical has branded itself a high-end health care provider serving a relatively affluent clientele that pays a $199 fee annually to receive easy online access to appointments, telemedicine and access to a streamlined, tech-focused medical experience. The company went public with an IPO in January 2020, with a valuation in the billions.

Didn't start work on the infrastructure for production until much later than other places (The UK started on this several months in advance, and I don't know if things have hit 100% for UK supplies of AZ yet) and also withheld some of the money for later stages until earlier stages were shown to be complete, meaning things couldn't be done in parallel

The UK and US both had taken precautions to protect their supplies, the UK writing in specific amounts and specific penalties into their contract and the US restricting sales completely while the EU contract essentially left them only able to delay payment for non-delivery.

As the supplies themselves go for AZ the EU is in the sort of situation the UK was in in late November of last year regarding supply, there were issues then that significantly delayed the numbers of doses the UK received, and look

(1) a common story over here in Germany is, that ""kids don't get Covid"". Looking at the USA, this doesn't quite seem right.

(2) Covid is commonly known as a respiratory disease but there's a pretty good chance that you're taking damage to the blood vessels' linings [a recent headline that passed by said that most people dying from Covid died due to internal suffocation, i.e. organs not receiving the oxygen they would have needed].

(3) organs not receiving enough oxygen do all kinds of strange things except what we're expecting them to do under normal circumstances.

(4) taking off arms and legs is a measure of last resort to keep the body attached to them alive; not doing this would make things even worse.

...each of these steps should be reason enough to keep up the Covid routine even while numbers are low until there's a reasonable amount of people vaccinated in the regional population.

What I don't quite get about the linked article (well, that may just be tabloid quality journalism): It claims that MIS-C has been linked to Covid and people being near people having Covid ... it's either ""you're near someone transmitting SARS-COV-2 and catch it, with all implications"" or ""it's not Covid"", right?",,,1614148601,{},gok2pgm,False,t3_lqx58l,False,True,t3_lqx58l,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lqx58l/boy_has_arms_legs_amputated_after_developing/gok2pgm/,1614307270,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The effects of childhood vaccines and other built-up immunity are also long-lasting, Iwasaki said, and won't disappear overnight because we're keeping our distance from others during the pandemic.

Experts say anyone looking to boost their immune health during the pandemic should practice habits such as stress management, healthy eating, regular exercise and getting enough sleep.”

By the time I get vaccinated, 70-80% of the rest of the population (that wants to get vaccinated) will be vaccinated as well. And that's why i won't be wearing a mask.

90% protected from transmitting the disease after vaccination essentially means its  OK to not wear a mask once you've been vaccinated

It targets both a protein known as a nucleocapsid, which coronaviruses use to infect their host, and the so-called spike protein zeroed in on by vaccines authorized for use already.

&gt;Scientists leading the trial say the nucleocapsid may be less likely to mutate than the spike protein, which since the start of the pandemic has changed in ways that lower the protection provided by vaccines that target the spike alone. The mutations have left countries racing to vaccinate people before variants of the virus emerge that could lower the efficacy of vaccines even further, or resist the shots entirely.

&gt;“The nucleocapsid protein appears to be much more stable and therefore has a lower risk of developing mutations that could risk vaccine failure,” said Graeme Meintjes, a professor of medicine at the University of Cape Town and co-investigator of the ImmunityBio trial, which in its first phase aims to assess whether the vaccine elicits an immune response as well as safety and dosage.

&gt;The trial, which began in the US in October, is the first in South Africa of a Covid-19 vaccine engineered to attack both proteins. It comes as makers of Covid-19 vaccines such as Pfizer and BioNTech and Moderna say they plan to update their shots to boost protection against variants that have emerged thus far.

* Understand from the beginning that supply issues will be a problem. Anyone could have predicted that. 
* Spend more per dose when  negociating contracts (like Israel did)
* Buy more doses, from more supplier from the get go to insure availability of doses from Q1.  
* Make sure Swissmedic had the ressources to fast track vaccines homologations. Right now they take their damn time and haven't even approve the AZ one.

For example, face masks were shown to be efficacious in blocking the release of coronaviruses and influenza viruses, but not rhinoviruses, in exhaled breath (9). In addition, enveloped viruses (e.g., coronaviruses and influenza viruses) are less resistant to lipophilic disinfectants than nonenveloped viruses (e.g., rhinoviruses)”
It’s a warning, that some other measures might need to be considered to avoid these type of outbreaks, because the current ones are not effective for all types of infections.

Additionally, distant learning and social distancing for children who are still building their immune system is indeed a problem. That is also pointed out in the study I linked before. Children congregating after so many months of social distancing. In short, they may have been more susceptible to respiratory viruses because they likely had fewer exposures to people outside their households and thus fewer chances to contract them and build up immunity. The immune system is a learning device, and at birth it resembles a computer with hardware and software but few data. Additional data must be supplied during the first years of life, through contact with microorganisms from other humans and the natural environment.
But again, even while being at home, people still get exposed to viruses and bacteria, and as an adult your immune system doesn’t forget everything that have learned. Our immune system is really interesting and quite fascinating to learn about :)",,,1614150903,{},gok5ghc,False,t3_lqy0jx,False,True,t1_gok3vht,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lqy0jx/gardenvariety_germs_may_explode_in_covids_wake/gok5ghc/,1614308577,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This is bad math. It's not a 33% chance you get mild COVID; it's a 67% reduction in likelihood of having moderate to severe COVID. For whatever reason they chose in advance in the study protocols to measure efficacy at moderate to severe rather than including mild, so we don't know how much it reduces mild cases unless we get more data.

Incidentally, you're also comparing J&amp;J's global data that includes the SA variant, which didn't exist during the Pfizer and Moderna trials. The 72% efficacy against moderate to severe COVID in the US is quite protective.

&gt; We have no idea what the long term effects of “mild” COVID-19 is.

Not really sure what you would expect to it to be. Is there some mechanism by which you would expect someone with a mild cough or sore throat to be really likely to experience debilitating illness ten years later?

The thing is, fundamentally I agree the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are more effective, and I would rather get one of those than J&amp;J given a choice. But the protection from J&amp;J does seem to be REALLY good, and I would rather take that now and feel protected right away than have to wait for Pfizer in a couple months. If you judge that differently and can afford that choice, I think your risk perception is probably off, but I'm not going to cajole you for that.

Again to reiterate teachers want to go back to school to teach in person, but they don’t want to die which is a very good point as to why not go back to in person classes.   Yea plenty of schools are open but how many schools have had teachers die and teachers frustrated because they don’t want to die when online learning is an option. (Hint, it’s a lot.) the kids in California aren’t suffering worse than any other state, pretty much every single academia expert has agreed that this entire year of online was worthless and that it would do well to just restart this year again due to how little the kids across America learned and retained. It’s not just California, it’s the entirety of America. Teachers absolutely should not be ashamed, you said kids shouldn’t be told Nail Salons are more important than school you are correct so then we agree that Teachers should also have vaccine priority in order to get our schools opened up as well as the rest of staff including janitors and supervisors. For college admissions and tests? It’ll show? Really? That’s completely false and the reason why is due to lots of reasons but mainly because California doesn’t get to be the education capital of the world for no reason. We have literally the most rigorous universities here and as such the most rigorous preparations and rigorous teaching not to mention the fact that the college themselves waived the test and past year of grades to get into colleges. Know why? Because they understand that it’s not simply “open up schools” because people will die. They are more essential than dining staff so again we come to agree that they should receive priority vaccinations as well as staff to open up. California isn’t way behind, it’s every student from here to Utah to Texas to Georgia to Michigan to New York that is behind, and thankfully California has a teachers union to help ensure that teachers don’t die for no other reason than people just shouting “open schools now” without a modicum of sense or knowledge of how to do it. Thankfully there is a union here to ensure better pay and strong benefits not unlike that of Texas where if you go on strike you lose your teaching license. So no it’s not “open schools” and “teachers should be ashamed” it’s “let’s vaccinate our teachers and staff to open up quicker and ensure everyone does their part”.

One sign that the recent increase in cases may partly be due to the snow is in the death numbers.

""Kids don't get COVID"" was never the case.  What is true is that kids seem to be much less affected by COVID than adults, particularly those under 10.  Seasonal influenza is actually more dangerous to kids than COVID, as far as people can tell (the US has recorded about [30 deaths from MIS-C](https://www.cdc.gov/mis-c/cases/index.html) compared to a couple hundred annual pediatric deaths from flu).

&gt; (2) Covid is commonly known as a respiratory disease but there's a pretty good chance that you're taking damage to the blood vessels' linings 

[Yeah, it seems to be a disease of the blood vessels that's transmitted by respiratory infection](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lque7y/critical_covid19_represents_an_endothelial/).

&gt; It claims that MIS-C has been linked to Covid and people being near people having Covid 

IIRC, MIS-C is *not* COVID, but seems to be an inflammatory reaction in kids that happens some time after they get over a SARS-COV-2 infection.  Patients with MIS-C generally don't test positive for SARS-COV-2, because their bodies have cleared it.  It's something that happens later.  Early on, there was an analogy to [Kawasaki disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kawasaki-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354598#:~:text=No%20one%20knows%20what%20causes,likely%20to%20get%20Kawasaki%20disease.), which is somewhat mysterious but is thought to be an immune reaction to a past viral infection (e.g., a kid gets this virus, gets over without anyone noticing, and then a similar virus causes the immune system to go into overdrive sometime later).",,,1614169778,{},gokqc22,False,t3_lqx58l,False,True,t1_gok2pgm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lqx58l/boy_has_arms_legs_amputated_after_developing/gokqc22/,1614319080,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,spiral8888,,,[],,,,text,t2_6mp9sipu,False,False,[],"&gt; All this information is readily available and it’s better for both parties if you take them on their word rather than the Reddit typical “source?!” for easily verifiable claims.

To me that is the wrong approach. Mainly because anonymous people in Reddit make far more claims that I have time to start verifying. It is impossible for me to know in advance how easy it is to find the source that verifies the claim. It is much easier for the person who has made the claim and presumably then already found the source to attach the link to the source while typing their response. That's what I try to do when I make claims. 

The problem with the claims without a source is that while yes, sometimes you can find the source easily, sometimes it is more difficult to find and in that case you can either try to dig deeper or conclude that the claim was not true. If you do the latter, you usually get a response ""you just can't google"". The other problem with the claims is that they are often made in a vague manner. This can then lead me finding a source that would verify some claim, but not the one how I would interpret the made claim. In that case, I'm not sure if I found the source that was used to make the claim (and that the claim maker just misinterpreted the source) or that I again just didn't want the right source. If the claim maker gives the source, then I can immediately verify what exactly he/she is claiming.

For instance, your claim that b117 variant is 50% more transmissible than the original variant didn't seem to be based on the source that you now dug out as that gave a different number for the increase of transmissibility than in your original claim. 

&gt; Given that the majority of the worlds population is urban, R numbers from urban settings aren’t really outliers or non representative.  

New York city is not a typical Western city. It is more densely populated than most. Yes, in Asia you find similar cities. One of the main reasons why the covid outbreak was so overwhelming in New York last year was that it was the ideal location for it to spread because of the high population density. 

In any case, the main point is that you have to compare like with like. If you want to take the R0 of New York City for covid, then you need to take the same for flu as well.

We can take that a step further in saying that only 36,672 deaths from people under 55 have died of it, while it's 54,134 for people between 55 and 65. That trend continues for the next ten years, too. The deaths are so dramatically skewed by age that it's kind of mind blowing.

This is a big reason I'm coming to think that we might be best off doing the vaccinations fully by age and ignoring everything else. I know that sounds cavalier and maybe disregarding towards certain professions that are getting hurt by this more than others, but it would be the simplest method by far- everyone knows how old they are and it's damn easy to verify that kind of thing. Ideally we'd be setting aside vaccines for people with comorbidities as well and having a trustworthy network to get those people their doses, but if we're talking about this in terms of efficiency at probability of preventing deaths, I think age needs to be the fundamental backbone of any distribution plan.",,,1614136374,{},gojj96i,False,t3_lr1w30,False,False,t3_lr1w30,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lr1w30/pfizer_moderna_jj_pledge_240_million_total/gojj96i/,1614298247,79,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Here's another way of thinking about it: If the vaccine was 100% effective, there would've been zero events. You would've had a fair point if there was a low baseline number of hospitalisations in the non-vaccinated group. This might have occurred if the study's sample size was small. This was the case for [the recent study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.10.21251247v1) that showed poor efficacy of the Astrazeneca vaccine against the South African variant. People got excited by the fact that there were zero serious cases or deaths in the test group, but the sample size was small and there were also zero serious cases or deaths in the control group. It would be similar if, hypothetically, researchers studied the entire population of New Zealand rather than Scotland. The sample size would be huge, but it would still be pretty meaningless since there are few if any covid cases there to begin with. By contrast, this study had a huge sample size (the whole population of Scotland) \*and\* many thousands of hospitalisation events.

If a study of the entire population of Scotland, that shows a reduction in hospitalisations from several thousand to 2, really isn't big or significant enough for you, I don't really know what to say.

In other words, for each 1 person infected with influenza, fewer than 1 person is infected.  If that is the case, mathematically, the disease will trend to zero.  When the disease goes to zero, and tends to remain there, we have herd immunity.

The rate of transmission is dependent on several factors:

* Disease characteristics (infectivity)
* Population characteristics (density, genetics)
* Population behaviors (masks, distancing, hand washing)
* Percent of population susceptible (immunity)
* Seasonal effects (weather, vitamin D)

In general, influenza tends to have an R0 that fluctuates above and below 1, depending on seasonal effects. Thus, the population of infected individuals grows during flu season, and shrinks during summer. Depending on which side of the equator you are on, whether ""flu season"" is December or June flips.

Due to our population behaviors, and possibly increased adoption of the flu vaccine this fall, we reduced influenza's Rt to below 1 *despite* the seasonal effects, which is why influenza infections have trended to zero (UK, Ireland) or all-time lows (USA, 1,387 cases since Sept. 27).

Thus, we've achieved herd immunity.  However, it isn't a permanent state; it depends on the population behaviors that have mitigated disease transmission.

You could make a similar argument that, under lockdowns, we achieve a temporary herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2, which is why the total number of new cases is currently dropping. However, as we open things back up, inevitably, we will allow Rt to exceed 1.0 again, and the virus will begin to spread again.

We could require anyone who isn't vaccinated to quarantine and give them the option to get vaccinated here, tourists and citizens. This would enable tourists who want to get vaccinated but don't have the option do that in their home countries to be inoculated and then they'd be able to travel wherever they want without quarantining. It would also encourage anti-vaxxers to get vaccinated, because otherwise they'd have to quarantine every time they travel out of the country.

&gt;The US, UK and EU have all ordered or optioned similar numbers of vaccines on a per capita basis — more than five doses per person. But by accelerating approval processes, betting on some manufacturers and not others, and in the case of the UK and US, investing more in advance to help companies boost development and production capacity, London and Washington have made a faster start than Brussels.

&gt;In total, the UK and US have each spent about seven times more upfront, per capita, on vaccine development, procurement and production than the European bloc, according to data gathered by Airfinity, a London-based life sciences analytics company. 

&gt;While the figures include different types of funding and might not be exactly comparable, the data suggest EU member states should have used more economic firepower earlier to finance upgrades of factories and vaccine raw materials suppliers, said Rasmus Bech Hansen, Airfinity’s chief executive. 

&gt;“It’s tricky but I just think there are special circumstances in a pandemic,” he said. “Everything is a trade-off and timing is just so critical — weeks and months mean a lot.”

The seasonal flu has specific mutations which make it less deadly but more virulent than the Spanish flu. The Spanish flu itself was actually several strains which had different properties (one which spread faster and deadlier among certain age groups).

In general, deadly viruses tend to mutate to less deadly versions because those are superior strains. The goal of a virus is to spread, not to kill - killing generally reduces the ability to spread.

This is why the deadliest viruses almost always come from other species and jump to humans - they evolved for thousands or millions of years against their host's immune system, which has developed strong counter-measures, so that by the time it succeeds in jumping to humans it is in a deadly form. Once in humans, it then mutates again to a less deadly form.

There are many, many studies on this and the Spanish influenza's mutations. There is a better chart but here is a simplified one illustrating an important point:[https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmra0904322](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmra0904322)

This is why people panic about the avian flu and swine flu - 'human flu' has strong environmental pressure to mutate into a less deadly form which then always becomes the dominant strain over the deadly one. But avian and swine flu do not follow those rules for the previously described reasons (they are trying to balance their mutations to be mild for birds and pigs - which ends up being deadly for humans).",,,1614123607,{},goitz9c,False,t3_lqgjq0,False,False,t1_gogvwdh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lqgjq0/not_a_single_case_of_flu_detected_in_england_this/goitz9c/,1614285962,16,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Yes, I agree, when 80% of people are vaccinated you don't have to wear a mask.

No, you're just making stuff up at this point. You argued the vaccine makes it so you can't transmit the virus. Not that it ""helps prevent the spread"".

Understanding the origins of the outbreak is a purely scientific endeavor—this isn’t an issue of placing blame as you keep returning to.

Knowing where and how the virus arose has no bearing on how prepared individual countries are for any future pandemic.

Denver is preparing to play a bigger role in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and is setting its own priority list rather than follow the dictates from Gov. Jared Polis.

**The big picture:** Mayors across the country are demanding a direct supply of the vaccine, which currently is being allocated through states. Hancock raised the issue on a recent call with Vice President Kamala Harris and again in a letter Thursday to the Biden administration.

The city's goal is to reach populations hit hard by the pandemic, including racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants and the homeless, as well as other groups having trouble accessing the vaccine.

**""We have a better perspective** on the challenges that those communities are \[facing\] every day ... and we know for a fact they are being overlooked,"" Hancock told Axios.

**Why it matters:** Hancock's push represents the most high-profile challenge to Polis' pandemic response and comes after weeks of feuding between the two Democrats.

* He's not alone: Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers has argued his cityis being shortchanged, too.
* Hancock is careful to not directly criticize Polis. When it comes to the difference in the vaccine priorities, he said that ""neither one is wrong — we just need to dig a little deeper with regards to our demographics.""

**The other side:** Polis doesn't want to relinquish control. He recently said Denver's plan to inoculate the homeless would ""cost lives"" and take vaccines from people over age 70, The Denver Post reports.

**What to watch:** The first of four new sites managed by Denver Health opened Thursday in Montbello, a historically underserved neighborhood predominantly home to people of color.

There's less cancer diagnosis's right now as people defer doctors visits etc. People still get it, but less likely to be diagnosed in the past year.  Less diagnosis means less cause of death unless there's an autopsy.

Lots of cancer patients die from infections.  The treatment lowers their immune response and they catch a cold, which wrecks them. Less diagnosis means less treatment, which means less deaths attributed to cancer.

A lot of those deaths are comorbidities.  You may die of a heart attack... but lots of heart attacks happen at work.  A lot of them are stress induced.  Less working, more time at home, more sleep, lots of changes come into play here. High cholesterol too.  People eating out less and eating healthier at home for the past year is also going to have some impact.

There's less car accidents now too.  Way less people on the road driving to work, less people out at night drinking and driving etc. etc.  That means less car fatalities, it also means less heart attacks from people stressed about traffic, getting to work late, their loved one being in an accident etc. etc.

Even a cold can raise your blood pressure and resting heart rate... which is correlated with an increase in heart attacks.  Less cold/flu will naturally drop the heart attack rate.

Transmissible diseases are also down thanks to social distancing and masks.

The one-shot coronavirus vaccine made by Johnson &amp; Johnson provides strong protection against severe disease and death from Covid-19, and may reduce the spread of the virus by vaccinated people, according to new analyses posted online by the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday.

The vaccine had a 72 percent overall efficacy rate in the United States and 64 percent in South Africa, where a highly contagious variant emerged in the fall and is now driving most cases. The efficacy in South Africa was seven points higher than earlier data released by the company.

The vaccine also showed 86 percent efficacy against severe forms of Covid-19 in the United States, and 82 percent against severe disease in South Africa. That means that a vaccinated person has a far lower risk of being hospitalized or dying from Covid-19.

The analyses confirmed that Americans are likely to benefit soon from a third effective coronavirus vaccine developed in under a year, as demand for inoculations greatly outstrips supply. The F.D.A. could authorize the vaccine as early as Saturday, depending on a vote of its vaccine advisory panel on Friday after it discusses the newly released documents.

“With a J&amp;J vaccine, we’ll be able to accelerate the vaccine rollout for our country and for the world,” said Dan Barouch, a virologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who led much of the early research on the vaccine last year.

Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine can be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures for at least three months, making its distribution considerably easier than the authorized vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, which require two doses and must be stored at frigid temperatures.

But access to the new vaccine could be severely limited at first. Dr. Richard Nettles, the vice president of U.S. medical affairs at Janssen Pharmaceuticals, the drug development arm of Johnson &amp; Johnson, told lawmakers on Tuesday that nearly four million doses would be ready for shipment after the F.D.A. authorizes the vaccine, far below the 12 million it had originally pledged to give the federal government by the end of February.

White House officials had an even lower estimate on Tuesday, telling governors on a weekly call that around two million doses would be available next week, according to an administration official.

Dr. Nettles said on Tuesday that a total of 20 million doses would be ready by the end of March. The company has a contract to deliver 100 million doses by the end of June.

Johnson and Johnson’s vaccine has a lower efficacy rate than the vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, which are both around 95 percent.

But in South Africa, the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is so far the clear winner. Novavax’s shot had an efficacy of 49 percent in South Africa. And a small trial in South Africa of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine found that it did not offer much protection at all. The negative results led the South African government to abandon its plan of giving a million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines to health care workers. Last week, the government started giving Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccines instead, and has so far administered more than 32,000.

The newly released documents, which include the F.D.A.’s first technical analysis of the company’s 45,000-person clinical trial, presented evidence that the vaccine was safe, with noticeably milder side effects than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and without any reports of severe allergic reactions like anaphylaxis.

The vaccine’s protection was consistent across Black, Hispanic and white volunteers, and also across different ages. The trial indicated a lower efficacy, of 42.3 percent, for people over 60 who had risk factors like heart disease or diabetes. But this figure came with a large amount of statistical uncertainty, the F.D.A. noted.

Although several vaccines can protect people from getting sick with Covid-19, it is unclear whether the shots can also prevent people from getting infected and passing the virus to others, leading to a debate about how quickly society can return to normal after inoculations begin.

Moderna’s trial found some hints that vaccinated people were less likely to develop an infection without symptoms. And AstraZeneca found that its vaccine reduced asymptomatic infections by about half.

Johnson &amp; Johnson looked for asymptomatic infections by checking for coronavirus antibodies 71 days after volunteers got a vaccine or a placebo. The new analyses estimate that the vaccine has an efficacy rate of 74 percent against asymptomatic infections. But that calculation was based on a relatively small number of volunteers, and the F.D.A. noted that “There is uncertainty about the interpretation of these data and definitive conclusions cannot be drawn at this time.”

“I think it’s going to add to the growing evidence that the vaccines really do prevent infection as well as prevent disease,” Dr. Barouch said.",,,1614173600,{},gokw9xw,True,t3_lrcwmu,False,True,t3_lrcwmu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lrcwmu/new_analyses_show_johnson_johnsons_onedose/gokw9xw/,1614322181,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I'm informed that there is a more contagious variant around. How much contagious, that's usually not in the news. That's exactly why I asked you for the source as you claim to have quantitative information on the topic. Instead you seem to be constantly extremely hostile towards me. I'm not sure why. 

&gt; This study reports a max R0 of \~3 for influenza in New York during winter. 3 vs 5.4 is a huge difference that deserves being highlighted. 

Well, if R0 for flu is 3 in NYC and 5.4 for covid, the ratio is pretty similar to R0 being 1-2 for flu (mentioned in the first comment) and [2-3 for covid](https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laninf/PIIS1473-3099(20)30840-9.pdf) that started the whole discussion. The main point is that it's not 1-2 for flu and ""a bit under 6"" for covid in similar conditions. 

I wasn't saying at any point that covid isn't more infectious than flu. I was questioning the claim that made it look like 3 times more infectious when the correct number was more like 2 by my sources and again confirmed by your latest source. The new variant can indeed change the picture, but interestingly if you read the paper that you cited earlier, the prevalence of the new variant first increased in the UK, but then started to decrease. It was above 50% of all covid cases only a short time. So, using its R0 for *all* the covid cases is very misleading (especially, if you then take the New York City value for R0 without showing what's the prevalence of the new variant in New York). 

I guess if someone questions a quantitative claim then you read it as if they were questioning the qualitative claim as well.",,,1614173356,{},gokvv6w,False,t3_lqgjq0,False,True,t1_gokrn5h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lqgjq0/not_a_single_case_of_flu_detected_in_england_this/gokvv6w/,1614321971,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

But virologist Chantal Reusken of the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) explains that a second test can also be positive because the patient has a residue of nonreplicating viral RNA from their original infection in their respiratory tract, because of an infection with two viruses at the same time or because they had suppressed but never fully cleared the virus. So most journals want to see two full virus sequences, from the first and second illnesses, that are sufficiently different, says Paul Moss, a hematologist at the University of Birmingham. “The bar is very high,” Moss says. “In many cases, the genetic material just isn’t there.”

&gt;Even if it is, many labs don’t have the time or money to clinch the case. As a result, the number of genetically proven reinfections is orders of magnitude lower than that of suspected reinfections. The Netherlands alone has 50 such cases, Brazil 95, Sweden 150, Mexico 285, and Qatar at least 243.

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/11/more-people-are-getting-covid-19-twice-suggesting-immunity-wanes-quickly-some

Tldr: the rate of reinfections that are actually counted is a pretty high bar. science strongly supports there are thousands of cases worldwide exactly as I said.

&gt;""What I've been saying to my family is, as soon as the J&amp;J vaccine is authorized, if that's what you can get, you should get it as soon as it's your turn in line,"" says Jha.

&gt;He points out that the 66% vs. 95% effectiveness isn't the right comparison for several reasons. He notes that the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine was tested in different settings — the U.S., several Latin American countries and South Africa, where some worrisome variants of the virus were first seen.

&gt;""So that 66% number really represents an amalgamation of a variety of different clinical trials. Moderna and Pfizer were not tested in those circumstances,"" Jha tells All Things Considered. ""And even if you just look at the U.S. data, the Johnson &amp; Johnson number then starts getting much closer to the Moderna and Pfizer numbers.""",,,1614174822,{},gokyf3h,False,t3_lrcn3y,False,False,t1_gokxkwg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lrcn3y/fda_staff_endorses_johnson_johnsons_singleshot/gokyf3h/,1614323301,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

And while everyone focused in on the fact that some in the healthcare field are well compensated, they neglected to consider how many of these people never signed up to be put in this position and make meager salaries.

Imagine a different situation – the EU orders, say, 600 million Pfizer and 600 million Moderna doses, with some AZ and JJ sprinkled in for a good measure, for a total of 1,7 billion doses in total – and then both of the former fail to deliver and the mRNA technology is proven ineffective, while AZ delivers and saves the world.

They'd be lambasted for investing and paying in advance for unproven technology, we'd be reading criticism of ""how the EU invested in old big pharma corps instead of local expertise"" and so on, with Europeans demanding politicians' heads, with those using AZ vaccines laughing.

Point is, when the EU (as a bloc) paid that $400 million downpayment for 300 million doses in August, AZ vaccine (more commonly known as the Oxford vaccine back in the day) was seen as a safer bet, since ChAdOx-1 was already proven to work against MERS and people were certain that Oxford would deliver – especially when we heard the news of AZ plants producing vaccine in anticipation of a certain approval. Also, weren't they supposed to be ready first, as well?

And the strategy was pretty decent, too. They ordered pretty much everything, from new mRNA vaccines (200+100 million Pfizer, 160+80 million Moderna), through vector vaccines (300 million AstraZeneca), through other ones, some 2 billion doses in total. What we're seeing now is a worst-case scenario and a perfect storm of failures – Sanofi failed to deliver their vaccine, AZ cut their supply and so on.

Credit, where credit is due – the EU actually reacted to that by signing additional contracts with Moderna and Pfizer, while taking other actions to expand their portfolio.

The lasting damage done in that scenario would have likely been catastrophic.

If you are looking back NOW and saying 'huh, that wasn't so bad - (half a million dead so far and counting) and it certainly did not justify taking muh freedoms' - I have to point out the obvious and that it's ONLY BECAUSE of the massive undertaking starting with China trying to keep their citizens from travelling to most countries closing schools and movie theaters , stopping indoor dining and taking other steps to protect their populations. 

Wear a mask, stay 6 feet apart, no groups larger than X - these are all things that contributed to that milder than feared result.

Had they not taken steps to protect the idiots from themselves, you would have seen a death toll multiplier ranging anywhere from 2 - 10x by this point depending on just how bad things got and the domino effect on society.  

I remember at the peak of our (managed) pandemic crisis, in some major cities (LA comes to mind) - they didn't even bother taking you to the hospital if you were having a heart attack if they could not get a rhythm back at the scene. Ambulances were queued for hours to get to the ER doors.

Had the pandemic been unmanaged and allowed to just roll over the US like the tsunami - eventually you wouldn't have 911 service at all - no police response or ambulances whatsoever in many cities. 

It's not long after that you start having a breakdown in society  itself. From there it's a hop and skip to third world hell as infrastructure begins to fail as it did in Texas last week with or without the extreme weather. 

It becomes a cascade effect as the dominos start to fall and then it's the stock market collapsing and then a run on the banks and then it's not just TP you can't find - it's milk or eggs, or bread or baby formula. 

Bad things happen when people get desperate. 

Yes, this could have been much, MUCH worse but IMHO for you to look back with the clarity of hindsight and sneer with the sheer arrogance of complete ignorance is an incredible display of poor intellect and even poorer judgement. 

But you go on with your bad self thinking and believing that the ENTIRE WORLD of high IQ individuals in the scientific community of Doctors got it WRONG but your dumbass has it right.

We should just make you the Secretary General to the UN. What's your first order of business Mr. tilemaker?

All that being said, I welcome a little good news and if these vaccines are able to stop all the variants from severe illness AND retransmission - then I too am looking forward with a little less anxiety and a lot more optimism.

It is just that their bodies did not have a crazy response like those who show traditional symptoms for some reason.

My original comment about not giving symptoms was in response to the vaccine specifically. Generally speaking, most vaccines cause the body to learn to create antibodies ahead of time so if you come in contact with the virus later, the antibodies will be produced faster. This would prevent the virus from reproducing as much and would minimize the chances of you getting sick. As a side benefit to that, the odds are good the virus would also not reproduce to the point that you'd become infectious to others.

So, more or less, I was agreeing with your comment. It would be shocking if it DIDN'T reduce transmission. We may all still ""catch COVID"" with the vaccine (i.e. coming in contact with it), but being vaccinated would help your body kill it before it becomes a problem to yourself or others. For the 95% who the vaccine is effective for, they won't be the wiser that it happened at all.

&gt;  
&gt;Infrequent mask use also likely contributed to the superspreader event,  which occurred over about a week of multiple high-intensity exercise  classes, said the study, which was done by the CDC and the Chicago  Department of Public Health.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Two of the patrons who caught COVID-19 visited the emergency room, and  one was hospitalized for eight days. No deaths were reported from any of  the cases linked to the gym.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; [**The report**](https://archive.vn/o/vqc7l/https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7009e2.htm?s_cid=mm7009e2_w)  reinforces public health guidance that mask wearing — and staying home  when ill — is critical to reduce the spread of the virus, particularly  during indoor group activities like exercise classes. Masks should be  worn even during high-intensity exercise and when spaced 6 feet apart,  according to the report.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; The study also recommended virtual or online exercise classes as safer alternatives.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; “To reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission in fitness facilities, attendees  should wear a mask, including during high-intensity activities when  (more than) six feet apart,” said the report, which added that  facilities should enforce physical distancing and isolation after  symptoms begin. “Exercising outdoors or virtually could further reduce  (virus) transmission risk.”  
   
&gt;  
&gt;  The Chicago Department of Public Health was notified of the outbreak in  early September, according to the report, which does not name the  business.  
   
&gt;  
&gt;  Of 81 people who attended in-person exercise classes there over a  weeklong period at the end of the summer, 49 cases of COVID-19 were  confirmed by testing and another six probable cases were cited among  class attendees with COVID-19 symptoms who tested negative or did not  get tested.  
   
&gt;  
&gt;  The classes — which were held from Aug. 24 to Sept. 1 — were capped at  less than 25% capacity, roughly 10 to 15 people, according to the CDC.  Class members brought their own mats and weights and were stationed more  than 6 feet apart.  
   
&gt;  
&gt;  “Mask use, temperature checks, and symptom screenings were required on  entry; however, patrons were allowed to remove masks during exercise,”  the report said.  
   
&gt;  
&gt;  Three people attended these exercise classes “on the same day or after  they received a positive test result,” the report said; others attended  an exercise class on the day symptoms began or after.  
   
&gt;  
&gt; During interviews about in-class behaviors, 44 attendees reported “infrequent mask use.”  
   
&gt;  
&gt;  One patron tested positive for COVID-19 and notified the facility on  Sept. 1. By the time the city’s health department identified and began  investigating the outbreak in early September, the gym had already  informed all attendees about possible exposure to the virus and  temporarily closed for about two weeks, according to the report.  
   
&gt;  
&gt;  The report said that at the time of the outbreak, businesses in Chicago  were encouraged but not mandated to report COVID-19 cases. Under a  revised order, “city-licensed businesses are now required to report any  COVID-19–related suspension of operations and awareness of five or more  confirmed COVD-19 cases among employees or patrons,” according to the  CDC study.  
   
&gt;  
&gt;  The report does not name any of the gym patrons who were part of the  study, but said 68 of them were Chicago residents. The median age of  attendees was 42 years old.  
   
&gt;  
&gt;  The report noted that the number of positive cases linked to these  exercise classes might be undercounted because public health officials  had to rely on self-reporting from gym patrons.  
   
&gt;  
&gt;  The CDC also encouraged gyms to take precautions like improve building  ventilation, enforce proper mask use and remind patrons and employees to  stay home and observe quarantine guidance after symptom onset or  possible infection.  
   
&gt;  
&gt;  “The increased respiratory exertion that occurs in the enclosed spaces  of indoor exercise facilities facilitates transmission of SARS-CoV-2,  the virus that causes COVID-19, in these settings,” the CDC report said.  “To reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission in exercise facilities, employees  and patrons should wear a mask, even during high-intensity activities  when more than six feet apart.”",,,1614205146,{},gomv2wq,True,t3_lrolzu,False,False,t3_lrolzu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lrolzu/study_chicago_gym_spurred_covid19_outbreak_after/gomv2wq/,1614359353,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There will be isolated outbreaks, and they will likely occur in populations with lower immunity. This means that, just like the flu, a strong vaccination campaign will be needed to keep people out of the hospital.”

Course,. (varying numbers due to different surveys).. 30 to 40 percent of people have said they won't get the vaccine. 

So it's going to be interesting to see how that pans out.

I am glad they are doing these studies, but one thing people have to realize is that the contact tracing, and therefore the data inputs, are kind of terrible. 

If there is a case at our school, students who were deemed to have been close to the case have to stay home for a period of time. They are not required to get tested. No testing is required. With a majority of cases being asymptomatic and people only getting tested if they are visibly sick, the data we have on who has had Covid is partial and will be underreported. Teachers are more likely to go get tested if they are afraid they have been exposed.

Now it could very well be true that teachers are the primary spreaders (and note that the article says for maskless schools, so a lot of these are private or restricted to some states), I don't think we have complete enough data to know for sure. The number of school aged kids with Covid reported in my county is much higher than the number of students having Covid in the school district metrics. Our county health department identified clusters two to three months after they happened.

Just be aware that no matter how sound a study about schools is in their methodology, the quality of the input data is seriously flawed because of the lack of testing.

From today:

[No ‘Covid Zero,’ but Normalcy - The New York Times (nytimes.com)](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/briefing/tiger-woods-daniel-prude-death-illinois-bail.html)

&gt;The reasonable goal is to make it manageable, much like the seasonal flu. Fortunately, the vaccines are doing that. In fact, they’re doing better than that. For fully vaccinated people, serious illness from Covid is extremely rare, much rarer than serious illness from the seasonal flu...  
&gt;  
&gt;...And yet the seasonal flu does not grind life to a halt. It does not keep people from flying on airplanes, eating in restaurants, visiting their friends or going to school and work.  
&gt;  
&gt;The vaccines will not produce “Covid zero.” But they are on pace — eventually, and [perhaps even by summer](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/briefing/winter-storm-texas-blackout-afghanistan-latifa.html) — to produce something that looks a lot like normalcy. The rare exceptions won’t change that, no matter how much attention they receive.

Also last week:

[Vaccine Alarmism - The New York Times (nytimes.com)](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/briefing/ted-cruz-texas-water-iran-nuclear.html)

&gt;If you’re a regular reader of this newsletter, you’re probably familiar with [the idea of vaccine alarmism](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/briefing/donald-trump-pardon-phil-spector-coronavirus-deaths.html). It goes something like this:  
&gt;  
&gt;*The coronavirus vaccines aren’t 100 percent effective. Vaccinated people may still be contagious. And the virus variants may make everything worse. So don’t change your behavior even if you get a shot.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Much of this message has some basis in truth, but it is fundamentally misleading. [The evidence so far](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/01/briefing/vaccination-myanmar-coup-rochester-police.html) suggests that a full dose of the vaccine — with the appropriate waiting period after the second shot — [effectively eliminates the risk of Covid-19 death](https://twitter.com/ashishkjha/status/1356079020878786561/photo/1), nearly eliminates the risk of hospitalization and drastically reduces a person’s ability to infect somebody else. All of that is also true about the virus’s new variants.

I'm from Israel reading the news , some are good some are bad but there are a lot of one sided articles and you could see SNL in the news lately.

So I'm writing what I know based on news I'm reading from Israel and abroad and then decide for yourselves. 

1.Palestinians blame Israel several times for the coronavirus but when one of their top government members needed help they sent him to Israeli hospital (unfortunately he died but he had lung transplantation years ago , also by Israel).

2.Palestinians says Israel won't transport vaccines from West Bank to Gaza but Israel did it after they filled the forms properly - they could also send it through Egypt  and from there to Gaza , just saying.

3.Palestinians receive hundreds of millions dollars every year yet they can't buy they own vaccines. lately they paid the terrorists families an amount that could buy them the top vaccines.

4.Palestinians has elections soon - if Israel will help one of the nominates with bringing vaccines they are gone so they better scream ""Israel genocide apartheid"" all day long.

5.Israel vaccinate everyone in Israel including Palestinians and also Palestinians from the West bank who comes to work in Israel.

6.Israel has many pfizer vaccines but per the contract with pfizer they are used to get herd immunity and not for donations. Although Israel was ones of the first countries to support Moderna they were only given 100k doses right now but they should give millions in end of Q1 or half of Q2.

7.Israel can donate the moderna vaccines right now but not the pfizer as I said and even 5000 can go to medical staff of countries and help them as a start. Once Israel will get more moderna vaccines we will donate them and not use them as we have pfizer.

8.Would you rather give vaccines to those who wants to throw you to the sea or give to those who support you ? Netanyahu is taking trump like actions and focus on countries who support the country and I think it should be that way.

In the beginning media was very aggressive in painting Sweden as a country that takes no actions to deal with the virus. This has led to the following:

1: Some people believe that Sweden isn't doing anything, and they see the bad numbers indicative of that fact and conclude that the bad numbers are caused by not doing anything.

2: Some people believe that Sweden isn't doing anything, and they see that the numbers aren't actually that bad. There are plenty of countries doing worse. So they must be doing *something* right. Since media has said that Sweden isn't doing anything to stop the virus that must mean the virus isn't that bad.

3: There are a bunch of Swedes who have convinced themselves that nothing is being done to prevent the virus from spreading here and these people will agree with people in category 1.

But it's easy to disprove them all by looking at how society at large has changed. Most of my friends have been forced to work from home since the pandemic started. Universities have gone online.

[],,chilladipa,,,[],,,,text,t2_6z8harzu,False,False,[],"One of the biggest conundrums of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the simultaneous panic-hiring of medical professionals in hot spots and significant downsizing of staff across the country. From huge hospital systems to private practices, the stoppage of breast reductions and knee replacements, not to mention the drops in motor vehicle accidents and bar fights, have quieted operating rooms and emergency departments and put doctors' jobs on the chopping block. A widely cited survey suggests that 21% of doctors have had a work reduction due to COVID-19.

￼

For many American doctors, this is their first extended period of unemployment. Unlike engineers or those with MBAs who might see their fortunes rise and fall with the whims of recessions and boom times, physicians are not exactly accustomed to being laid off. However, doctors were already smarting for years due to falling salaries and decreased autonomy, punctuated by endless clicks on electronic medical records software.

Now, the twin shock of income loss and feeling unwanted in a pandemic — when, you know, medicine might seem especially essential — has doctors resorting to a bizarre array of side gigs, ""fun-employment"" activities, or outright career overhauls.

Stephanie Eschenbach Morgan, MD, a breast radiologist in North Carolina, trained for 10 years after college before earning a true physician's salary.

""Being furloughed was awful. Initially, it was only going to be 2 weeks, and then it turned into 2 months with no pay,"" she reflected.

Eschenbach Morgan and her surgeon husband, who lost a full quarter's salary, had to ask for grace periods on their credit card and mortgage payments because they had paid a large tax bill right before the pandemic began. ""We couldn't get any stimulus help, so that added insult to injury,"" she said.

With her time spent waiting in a holding pattern, Eschenbach Morgan homeschooled her two young children and started putting a home gym together. She went on a home organizing spree, started a garden, and, perhaps most impressively, caught up with 5 years of photo albums.

A bonus she noted: ""I didn't set an alarm for 2 months.""

Shella Farooki, MD, a radiologist in California, was also focused on homeschooling, itself a demanding job, and veered toward retirement. When one of her work contracts furloughed her (""at one point, I made $30K a month for [their business]""), she started saving money at home, teaching the kids, and applied for a Paycheck Protection Program loan. Her husband, a hospitalist, had had his shifts cut. Farooki tried a radiology artificial intelligence firm but backed out when she was asked to read 9200 studies for them for $2000 per month.

Now, she thinks about leaving medicine ""every day.""

Some doctors are questioning whether they should be in medicine in the first place. Family medicine physician Jonathan Polak, MD, faced with his own pink slip, turned to pink T-shirts instead. His girlfriend manages an outlet of the teen fashion retailer Justice. Polak, who finished his residency just 2 years ago, didn't hesitate to take a $10-an-hour gig as a stock doc, once even finding himself delivering a shelving unit from the shuttering store to a physician fleeing the city for rural New Hampshire to ""escape.""

There's no escape for him — yet. Saddled with ""astronomical"" student loans, he had considered grocery store work as well. Polak knows he can't work part time or go into teaching long term, as he might like.

Even so, he's doing everything he can to not be in patient care for the long haul — it's just not what he thought it would be.

""The culture of medicine, bureaucracy, endless paperwork and charting, and threat of litigation sucks a lot of the joy out of it to the point that I don't see myself doing it forever when imagining myself 5-10 years into it.""

Still, he recently took an 18-month hospital contract that will force him to move to Florida, but he's also been turning himself into a veritable Renaissance man; composing music, training for an ultramarathon, studying the latest medical findings, road tripping, and launching a podcast about dog grooming with a master groomer. ""We found parallels between medicine and dog grooming,"" he says, somewhat convincingly.

Also working the ruff life is Jen Tserng, a former forensic pathologist who landed on news websites in recent years for becoming a professional dog walker and house sitter without a permanent home. Tserng knows doctors were restless and unhappy before COVID-19, their thoughts wandering where the grass might be greener.

As her profile grew, she found her inbox gathering messages from disaffected medical minions: students with a fear of failing or staring down residency application season, and employed doctors sick of the constant grind. As she recounted those de facto life coach conversations (""What do you really enjoy?"" ""Do you really like dogs?"") by phone from New York, she said matter-of-factly, ""They don't call because of COVID. They call because they hate their lives.""

Michelle Mudge-Riley, MD, a physician in Texas, has been seeing this shift for some time as well. She recently held a virtual version of her Physicians Helping Physicians conference, where doctors hear from their peers working successfully in fields like pharmaceuticals and real estate investing.

When COVID-19 hit, Mudge-Riley quickly pivoted to a virtual platform, where the MDs and DOs huddled in breakout rooms having honest chats about their fears and tentative hopes about their new careers.

""There has been increased interest in nonclinical exploration into full- and part-time careers, as well as side hustles, since COVID began,"" she said. ""Many physicians have had their hours or pay cut and some have been laid off. Others are furloughed. Some just want out of an environment where they don't feel safe.""

An ear, nose, and throat surgeon, Maansi Doshi, MD, from central California, didn't feel safe — so she left. She had returned from India sick with a mystery virus right as the pandemic began (she said her COVID-19 tests were all negative) and was waiting to get well enough to go back to her private practice job. However, she said she clashed with Trump-supporting colleagues she feared might not be taking the pandemic seriously enough.

Finally getting over a relapse of her mystery virus, Doshi emailed her resignation in May. Her husband, family practice doctor Mark Mangiapane, MD, gave his job notice weeks later in solidarity because he worked in the same building. Together, they have embraced gardening, a Peloton splurge, and learning business skills to open private practices — solo primary care for him; ENT with a focus on her favorite surgery, rhinoplasty, for her.

Mangiapane had considered editing medical brochures and also tried to apply for a job as a county public health officer in rural California, but he received his own shock when he learned the county intended to open schools in the midst of the pandemic despite advisement to the contrary by the former health officer.

He retreated from job listings altogether after hearing his would-be peers were getting death threats — targeting their children.

Both doctors felt COVID-19 pushed them beyond their comfort zones. ""If COVID hadn't happened, I would be working...be 'owned.' In a weird way, COVID made me more independent and take a risk with my career.""

Obstetrician Kwandaa Roberts, MD, certainly did; she took a budding interest in decorating dollhouses straight to Instagram and national news fame, and she is now a TV-show expert on ""Sell This House.""

Like Doshi and Mangiapane, Polak wants to be more in control of his future — even if selling T-shirts at a mall means a certain loss of status along the way.

"" Aside from my passion to learn and to have that connection with people, I went into medicine...because of the job security I thought existed,"" he said. ""I would say that my getting furloughed has changed my view of the United States in a dramatic way. I do not feel as confident in the US economy and general way of life as I did a year ago. And I am taking a number of steps to put myself in a more fluid, adaptable position in case another crisis like this occurs or if the current state of things worsens.""",,,1614183417,{},golgg3x,True,t3_lrgj9l,False,False,t3_lrgj9l,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lrgj9l/docs_become_dog_walkers_and_warehouse_workers/golgg3x/,1614332781,13,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;  You have 0 sources 

I did my best to try to find primary sources other than the paper that you cited (and now try to discredit). I could not find anything using google as almost everything mentioning the new variant lead to articles a month or two ago. Your wikipage leads to [this](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/COVID-19-risk-related-to-spread-of-new-SARS-CoV-2-variants-EU-EEA-first-update.pdf) document that says to use [this](https://www.gisaid.org/hcov19-variants/) site as its data.  That's where you finally get to actual numbers and it does indeed show that the variant has become dominant in the UK. That site is definitely not in the first page for google search. By the way, that page puts the prevalence of the new variant in the US to 5.3%. So, if we go back to your favourite example of New York, it is highly unlikely that it is a dominant variant there.

&gt; The virus was sequenced in China.

This might be impressive if they didn't start this pandemic in the first place. 

&gt; Phizer developed its vaccine in Germany.

This deal exists because Germany does not have the ability to produce and distribute a COVID vaccine themselves. Also BioNTech used the mRNA technology already owned by Phizer. 

&gt; AstraZenca was developed in the UK

And so far it's the least effective of all the vaccines. 

&gt; Johnson and Johnson was co-developed between Belgium and the U.S

Same situation as with Phizer and BioNTech. 

&gt; The reason the U.S is administrating more vaccines than many other countries is not a matter of medical technological superiority, it is a matter of wealth. The U.S had the resources to secure hundreds of millions of doses before the vaccines we are currently distributing before they were even proven effective.

You're making it sound like there was just a big bag of vaccines for sale and the world had an auction to decide who would get it. The reason is because nobody else can produce the vaccine in the quantity needed because their medicine production technology is not up to par with the US. 

&gt; If the U.S decides to ""come to the rescue"" of other parts of the world it will not be through sharing of Medical Information, it will be though the transfer of wealth.

This is correct. Nobody is talking about sharing information. It's all about shipping vaccines produced in the US or investing in new vaccine production facilities abroad.

My guess is they picked march 8th as the Easter holidays will act as a 2 week firebreak against rising cases. Plus with the most vulnerable protected they will avoid deaths.

The study also looked at the most reliable wash method for removing the virus from 100% cotton fabric.

Only when detergent was used and the temperature increased to above 67°C was the virus was completely eliminated.
The study found there was no risk of cross-contamination when clean items were washed with those that had traces of the virus on.

The intro from that episode:

&gt;""Elon Musk sent a thank-you note to Tesla's workers returning to work,"" Business Insider squeals. Walmart teams up with UPS to air an ad ""thanking essential workers."" ""Jeff Bezos Just Posted an Open Letter to Amazon Employees About the Coronavirus. Every Smart Business Leader Needs to Read It,"" insists an article in Inc.   Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, corporate leaders, politicians and celebrities have been quick to paint ""essential workers,"" and those often described as ""frontline"" workers, as heroes — laborers conscripted, presumably against their will, into a wartime-like scenario of heroism and sacrifice as our country battles the ongoing coronavirus scourge.   The sentiment behind this rhetoric is understandable, especially from everyday people simply trying to express their deep appreciation for the underpaid labor doing the work to feed, house, care for and treat everyone else. But when deployed by powerful politicians and CEOs, the ""essential workers as heroes"" discourse serves a more sinister purpose: to curb efforts to unionize, preemptively justify mass death of a largely black and brown workforce, protect corporate profits and ultimately discipline labor that for a brief moment in spring of last year, had unprecedented leverage to extract concessions from capital.   As Wall Street booms and America’s billionaires see an increase of $1.1 trillion in wealth since March 2020 — a 40% increase — while the average worker suffers from unemployment, depression, drug abuse and a loss of healthcare, it’s become increasingly clear that “essential” never meant essential to helping society at large or essential to human care or essential to keeping the bottom from falling out, but essential to keeping the top one percent of the one percent’s wealth and power intact and as it turned out to be the case, massively expanded.   Indeed, 2020 saw the largest transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in decades, a transfer largely made possible by the essential worker as hero narrative, with little discussion or debate. In March 2020 everyone agreed in this wartime framing that was going to send off millions of poor people to their deaths for a vague, undecided greater good of the quote-unquote ""economy,"" when really it was for the seamless maintenance of Wall Street profits.   On this episode, we explore the origins of the concept of ""essential work"" and those deemed ""essential workers""; how it's been used in the past to discipline labor during wartime; how hero narratives provide an empty, head-patting verbal tip in lieu of worker protection and higher pay; and why so few in our media ask the more urgent question of all: whether or not low wage retail, food, farming, and healthcare workers ever wanted to be heroes in the first place.   Our guest in Ronald Jackson, a worker and organizer with Warehouse Workers For Justice.",,,1614168669,{},gokotwp,False,t3_lqw75k,False,True,t3_lqw75k,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lqw75k/once_viewed_as_essential_grocery_workers_now/gokotwp/,1614318301,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The elderly and retired, can be quarantined without much issue for a few months longer. 
1) stopping the transmission as fast as we can will stop the chance of having more variants, potentially making all vaccines worthless
2) the elderly can quarantine, while the working population cannot
3) the younger generation, once vaccinated can help and support the elderly (most elderly 80+ need a care giver to take them for their vaccines and other errands)

I understand that the elderly are at the highest risk group, but they have a worse immune response, are more able to stay quarantined, while the ‘working’ generations will continue to spread the virus until they are vaccinated.

Oh, and before you bring up the need to work, this isn't talking about people needing to go to work; it specifically asked about socializing in-person with people you don't live with:

&gt; Among Americans ages 18 to 29, 45% said in the past week they have socialized with people they do not live with while not maintaining social distancing, according to a new survey from the Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape Project. That is the highest rate among all age groups, with those ages 30 to 44 trailing just slightly at 42%

Any answer you get that is either ""yes"" or ""no"" is wrong, for now. We have only ""maybe, probably not"", and it's going to be that way for a long time.

In order to answer the question scientifically, it would require a ""challenge study"" where both vaccinated and unvaccinated people are deliberately exposed to the virus to see if transmission occurs.

The ethical concerns of deliberate exposure prevent us from performing these studies in humans.  It's the same reason that the vaccine trials took so long, we can't deliberately infect people to see if they need hospitalization or die. 

(EDIT: Well, now it looks like I [spoke too soon.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/llw5cu/worlds_first_coronavirus_human_challenge_study/))

However, we did these studies with monkeys and the results look [*really good.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03041-6) They show strong immunity, or [sterilizing immunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/la4fud/immunogenic_bnt162b_vaccines_protect_rhesus/) from multiple vaccine types.  However, it's unlikely that sterilizing immunity would be found in most vaccinated humans, if we even get sterilizing immunity at all. This is still good news. 

Also, you'll notice that any reputable person talking about this subject always says ""may be able to spread"", or ""maybe"", or ""we don't know if"". And that's because there is a small chance that vaccinated people will be able to spread the virus. But it's not a big chance. Doctors, scientists, and regulators are being very careful with their language on this subject, some would argue they're being too careful. That said, if they were to say that ""vaccinated people cannot spread the virus"", and then we find out that in some situations that vaccinated people have spread the virus, [that would end up worse for them than if they hedge for a while.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/los8r9/daily_discussion_thread_february_21_2021/goa8cu0/) So at least to me, the way they're framing it seems pretty reasonable, you just have to put yourself in their shoes.

Just because [mRNA vaccines aren't 100% effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/)  against the SA variant, *doesn't* [mean that we'll definitely need boosters](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gmu581s/).

I like [thegracefuldork's prediction about vaccine availability](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lcatpp/daily_discussion_thread_february_04_2021/gm0bwc8/) more than my own previous prediction.  Not because it's ""rosier"", but because it's just better.

**Which vaccine should I get?**

When someone asks me what my favorite beer is, the answer is always the same.

It's the one in front of me.

So get the first vaccine you can, the differences are pretty minor.

**Booster questions to think about, I don't have answers**

(note: there's a difference between ""boost"" and ""booster"" here that needs to be understood.)

(also, what's the term for a mixture of sequences, heterogenous? Is my doubt about this term just from overthinking?)

(also also, I'm not convinced we're definitely going to need boosters, this is just fun to think about.)

Could a booster shot replace the second dose of a prime/boost regimen?

Should a booster shot use only one sequence of mRNA (or have all identical spike proteins), or should it have both/multiple?

For future vaccines, should the sequence/spike be the same for prime/boost or different?  If you have four spikes/sequences, would it make more sense to do two in each, or all four in each?

How much should we trust mutation modeling here? Should we anticipate future mutations and include them?  Are we good enough at that yet?

Do we need to give any non-booster doses to people who have recovered from infection?

Could we ""stretch"" doses of an mRNA booster by priming with a vaccine that's easier to manufacture, but maybe less effective (like ChAdOx1), and boost with the mRNA booster?  Could it be better or faster to prime with a current mRNA sequence and boost with an updated ChAdOx1?  Could we maybe do [this in the US?]( https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-first-covid-19-alternating-dose-vaccine-study-launches-in-uk) 

[**Conclusions**](https://gfycat.com/cleantalkativedassie)

Okay, so the vaccines reduce infections, and if someone gets an infection after getting vaccinated, they have fewer and reduced symptoms.  This currently seems to also be true with post vaccination infection with any of the known variants. We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with mild symptoms spread only slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well. 

In other words: A reduction in symptoms is at least correlated with a reduction in the ability to spread the virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections and symptoms in those who do get infected. Therefore, vaccines should reduce spread.

If people develop immunity via clearing an infection, each subsequent variant they are exposed to will just broaden their immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). So they'll have good and broad immunity to a variety of variants, which seems likely to be an indication that they won't catch or spread the virus as well in the future. Same thing happens when someone who is vaccinated is exposed to a new variant. Their immunity is broadened and strengthened by each subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. But remember, so many people will be less likely to spread the virus, so it's pretty unlikely that this reduced level of spread will be sufficient to sustain the virus in the way we have seen over the past year. So if a variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. If they don't become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing to have my mind changed on this with new information though, so don't take this as gospel. 

Tips on clarifying my terms/language/understanding appreciated.  Did I miss something that could help people? Please let me know!

Get the first vaccine you can get.  [They work.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/l9y3ca/daily_discussion_thread_february_01_2021/glle744/)

Vaccines given EUA are safe even if you hear [about someone dying or growing an extra arm.](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/12/04/get-ready-for-false-side-effects)

Should we be excited about a vaccine that's not 90%+ effective like Moderna? Excellent question! [Absolutely, yes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/l7mzvn/daily_discussion_thread_january_29_2021/gl8iyj5?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) 

They [work so well](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/l7apag/just_004_of_israelis_caught_covid19_after_two/) and are so super safe that super smart super rich [people are paying to cut in line](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kzbsfk/some_wealthy_americans_accused_of_getting/) to get them. If it wasn't safe and [effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/li9jg8/it_works_0_deaths_only_4_severe_cases_among/), they wouldn't be paying thousands for shots. People have even been [dressing up as seniors to get shots!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lneqkk/two_florida_women_caught_dressing_as_seniors_to/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

Vaccine induced immunity is [comparable to](https://www.verywellhealth.com/antibodies-from-vaccines-and-from-natural-infection-5092564), or [better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l5whhu/increased_resistance_of_sarscov2_variants_b1351/) immunity from a previous infection. Especially [variants of concern.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgxpre/vaccineinduced_immunity_provides_more_robust/)

Post infection immunity lasts [*at least 8 months*](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/koxkm1/sarscov2_infection_induces_longlived_bone_marrow/), though [probably a lot longer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/klpvp7/sarscov2specific_t_cell_memory_is_longlasting_in/)  Again, [*at least* 8 months, though you may not even really need very many antibodies,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ldj06f/immunological_memory_to_sarscov2_assessed_for_up/) since other types of immunity seem to be more important.  It's too soon to say ""lifelong"" but [that is a possibility.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4nkco/the_immune_system_mounts_a_lasting_defense_after/) Also, it looks like those who have recovered *may* only need [one dose of an mRNA vaccine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/labst4/robust_spike_antibody_responses_and_increased/). There are some people (~7%) who don't develop lasting immunity from infections, but it's not clear to me now whether vaccines would develop lasting immunity for these people. 

Immunity from the vaccine [lasts *at least 6 months*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l9nfu8/stable_neutralizing_antibody_levels_six_months/) probably a lot,[ lot longer,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6a6pq/durability_of_responses_after_sarscov2_mrna1273/)  probably many years. 

The OG SARS virus from 2003 gave detectable immunity [both 6](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/12/7264) and [12 years later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kvbz9y/weekly_question_thread/gizs32j/)   

Covid19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, OG SARS was caused by SARS-CoV. Looks like both came from bats.  [They’re 79% the same.](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930251-8) (PDF)

**Variants**

The currently approved vaccines (Pfizer/Moderna) work acceptably against [all the new variants.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kqz7y5/comprehensive_mapping_of_mutations_to_the/) They [probably work better than you were expecting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l685dy/vaccination_against_the_new_variants_realworld/)  Even that [British one](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l15czh/neutralization_of_sarscov2_lineage_b117/) you just read about.  

[Seriously,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4pnde/mrna1273_vaccine_induces_neutralizing_antibodies/) it's [very probably](https://reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l6vs1t/in_vitro_studies_demonstrate_pfizer_and/), like, [not going to be a problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l0yqe6/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gjwov3s?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) Yes, even the SA variant, [which might not be a concern at all.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kxkrb9/endemic_sarscov2_will_maintain_postpandemic/) The more vaccines we test, the more we find that they still [work against the variants](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lax5wa/neutralization_of_sarscov2_voc_501yv2_by_human/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), at least enough to be totally worthwhile. 

ChAdOx1 (Oxford/Astrazeneca) may not be so great against the SA variant, and we have a lot to learn here.  Novavax's vaccine also may have issues with the SA variant, though it doesn't seem that they're as big as with ChAdOx1. [This was encouraging,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmp5doo/) regarding the efficacy of vaccines against variants.

Pfizer [seems fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lf7uph/neutralization_of_viruses_with_european_south/) against the troubling variants, at least in the lab. At the very least, the mRNA vaccines [*still* work](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfp89k/neutralization_of_sarscov2_spike_6970_deletion/) on the three most worrying variants.

Still worried about variants? Check [this out!](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/01/27/vaccination-against-the-new-variants-real-world-data) *

Most variants aren't great at being viruses.  [Some, including that one mink variant have already gone extinct](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/19/danish-covid-mink-variant-very-likely-extinct-but-controversial-cull-continues). I think there are other Mink variants that have made it into wild Mink populations.


Antibodies from recovered people who then got an mRNA vaccine [work on variants *and* OG SARS?!](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfiypu/antibodies_elicited_by_sarscov2_infection_and/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) This should really put the variant fear behind us.

**Vaccines Seem to Reduce Spread**

Vaccination and previous infection[ reduce viral load, which reduces spread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s).

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) * article does a good job of explaining the likelihood of vaccines *at least* reducing spread.  [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lf744r/daily_discussion_thread_february_08_2021/gml0gyi/) may help if that article is too much. 

[""Moderna vaccine blocks &gt;90% (87-93%) of infections &amp; 91% (89-94%) of transmission.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmqfk4q/)

Milder cases, especially asymptomatic cases [are worse at spreading](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kcy2e0/weekly_question_thread_week_of_december_14/gg8tp7n/).  

[Pfizer's vaccine may prevent spread and disease.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/loljxz/effectiveness_results_of_the_pfizer_covid19/) Looks like the amount of virus in people who've gotten one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and then infected is [greatly reduced compared to those not vaccinated](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfiqma/decreased_sarscov2_viral_load_following/).  This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a great reduction in ability to spread the virus. [Maybe even with just one dose!](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242) 

Reinfections are rare, some studies show [less than 1 in 1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kyj0bx/sarscov2_reinfection_in_a_cohort_of_43000/) (maybe in the 1 in 10,000 range).  Reinfections tend to be much milder than previous infections, even those new variants. Check the [comments here](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lm0mc2/prior_covid19_significantly_reduces_the_risk_of/) for some really interesting discussion regarding reinfection.

What? That is the most idiotic thing I've heard. Nothing is absolute. The burden of proof always errs on the side of caution. This is what got us into trouble in the first place ""meh, it's no worse than the flu""... ""meh, I haven't been affected by it so it must not be real"".

Transmissibility is reduced no doubt but to think that once you're fully vaccinated that you can't transmit it at all especially when not everyone else has had a chance to get the vaccine and with restrictions lifted.

Portugal does have a shot at things though, they are making Lisbon into a tech hub, but they need to find a way to share the new wealth from Lisbon to the rest of the country.

I don't get where you got this idea, I said no where that I would or wouldn't take the vaccine. Just because I can point out that AZ fucked up big time doesn't mean I wouldn't take the vaccine.

Anyone smart enough can see this, and I'm pretty sure you see it but you just don't want to admit it and you're trying to flip this on me by assuming I wouldn't take the vaccine.

If it makes you feel better, of course I'd take the vaccine.

It's sad that you framed me as a nationalist pig when all I've stated is the truth:

- UK doesn't allow AZ export vaccines to the EU, and effective export ban per definition;

- that fact is not helping what so ever with vaccine deliveries, and this is costing European lives, despite being in EU contract that vaccines are to come from UK plants as well as from EU plants;

- AZ since trial data was submitted they've been a clusterfuck publicly left and right, and more countries are pilling up against these fuck ups, some not approving vaccines, some questioning their promises to deliver;

- UK is practicing vaccine nationalism, per definition;

And you don't like that I'm pointing this out, so it's better to frame me as a nationalist european (what ever this means, it's a group of 27 countries I don't see how this is nationalist).

But maybe, just maybe, it's the other way around... could it be that you're the brit nationalist defending vaccine nationalism, by trying to justify an export ban that has a cost of european lives, while blindly defending a company bad practices and shadiness just because the vaccine was researched by a britsh institution?

First, I'm all for common sense restriction until herd immunity is possible, hopefully through vaccinations. However, consider how short-term and non-lethal most viruses are. Then consider all the problems that have increased due to quarantines in lockdowns, such as alcoholism, domestic abuse, depression, anxiety, and then of course there's the economic impact of closed businesses. If we have a lockdown everytime there's a minor disease running around, like the flu or strep, that would case more harm than good.

""In 2007, [Timothy Ray Brown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4287108/) became the first person ever whom doctors declared to be cured of HIV. At the time, they referred to him publicly as the Berlin patient.

His journey toward a cure was not straightforward. After having received an HIV diagnosis in the 1990s, Mr. Brown received antiretroviral treatment — the usual course of action for an HIV infection.

However, later on, he also received a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia, for which he eventually required a stem cell transplant.

As he was looking for a suitable donor match, his doctor had the idea to try an experiment. He looked for a donor with a specific genetic mutation that made them practically immune to HIV.

Receiving stem cells from this donor, it turned out, not only treated Mr. Brown’s leukemia but also cured the HIV infection.

Now, as a study featuring in [*The Lancet*](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhiv/article/PIIS2352-3018(20)30069-2/fulltext) shows, another person has officially been cured of HIV, also thanks to a stem cell transplant.

## ‘Success of stem cell transplantation’

In this second case, the person received a stem cell transplant with cells that did not express the *CCR5* gene, which produces a protein that helps the virus enter cells.

The cells without the *CCR5* gene were part of a bone marrow transplant, which the person was undergoing as a treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma.

**Following the transplant, and at 30 months after the person ceased antiretroviral therapy, doctors confirmed that the HIV viral load remained undetectable in blood samples.**

This finding means that whatever traces of the virus’s genetic material might still be in the system, they are so-called fossil traces, meaning that they cannot lead to further replication of the virus.

The specialists confirmed that HIV also remained undetectable in samples of cerebrospinal fluid, semen, intestinal tissue, and lymphoid tissue.

“We propose that these results represent the second ever case of a patient to be cured of HIV,” says the study’s lead author, Prof. Ravindra Kumar Gupta, from the University of Cambridge in the U.K.

&gt;“Our findings show that the success of stem cell transplantation as a cure for HIV, first reported 9 years ago in the Berlin patient, can be replicated.”  
– Prof. Ravindra Kumar Gupta

However, Prof. Gupta emphasizes that “\[i\]t is important to note that this curative treatment is high risk and only used as a last resort for patients with HIV who also have life threatening hematological \[blood\] malignancies.”

“Therefore, this is not a treatment that would be offered widely to patients with HIV who are on successful antiretroviral treatment,” the researcher goes on to caution.

Commenting on these findings, other researchers involved in the study express the hope that, in the future, scientists may be able to use state-of-the-art gene editing tools as part of interventions meant to treat and cure HIV.

Dr. Dimitra Peppa, who is from the University of Oxford in the U.K. and co-authored the study, notes that “\[g\]ene editing using the *CCR5* has received a lot of attention recently.”

Nevertheless, she points out, there is still a long way to go before such therapies may become viable.

“There are still many ethical and technical barriers — e.g., gene editing, efficiency, and robust safety data — to overcome before any approach using *CCR5* gene editing can be considered as a scalable cure strategy for HIV,” she says.""    


So, uh, I just guess the first people cured just don't exist, to you?

There are many other occupations that require being around lots of people all day, some of whom cannot even wear masks (think dentists, daycare workers, makeup artists). Grocery is not the only sector that's both essential and exposed to the masses by any means. Why are grocery workers more important than other people on this list? Society needs most of these jobs to keep functioning.

Even though grocery is definitely more essential than, say, doing makeup, all of these industries are up and running so the risk is there whether it's justified or not. I mean shit, think about flight attendants. They're probably around more people in a day than anyone else in this list and in much closer proximity for longer. 

The flip side of that is that some jobs may be around fewer people, but workers are around them for 8+ hours so viral load will be higher (and therefore make you more sick. Plenty of papers on this).

Germany is likely to resent the EU after this. France not so much because they would have spent all their croissants on Sanofi instead.

You are touching on the insurmountable problem with the EU. Its member states are so diverse that anything the EU does comes at _someone's_ expense. Finland, Bulgaria and Italy have almost nothing in common and want to take opposing courses of action on almost everything, so they either settle on a compromise no one is happy with, or one side pushes its preference through and the others lose (and threaten to veto, so the compromise is chosen instead).

This is not nearly as much of an issue in the US, though it is starting to show up in places. There are still plenty of things the federal government can do that either benefit everyone or benefit some states and don't harm the others.

Not so with the EU. Reducing trade frictions is one (the scope of the old EEC), scientific collaboration, and aligning regulations to reduce the cost of doing business. That's about it.

Buying vaccines? Germany wants a billion Pfizer doses, Bulgarian wants AZ because they don't have the infrastructure for cryogenic storage, France wants Sanofi, and then they need to find common ground and end up with exactly the format implemented by the EU: everyone gets their say and we end up with 6 vaccine suppliers that each provide a fraction of what the continent needs.

TBH, the major European countries need to start planning for a post-EU future, and the smaller countries need to find other similar countries and band together (Visegrad 4, New Hanseatic League, etc).

Never mind that their neighbor’s grandma died last week after testing positive, she had COPD and was gonna die anyway.

To be clear: keeping employees healthy and safe during a pandemic is an undue hardship.

Here's a thought: Why don't we have a government that forces companies to operate safely and follow CDC guidelines?  Better yet why do we have a government that actively protects companies from liability from work conditions that expose employees to COVID?

""iF iT's So uNsAfE jUsT qUiT""

With healthcare tied to employment, people can't just quit their jobs.  They would lose their health insurance, a source of income, and still could get COVID which would all but bankrupt them. **And businesses know this,** so they are able to subject employees to whatever they like with little to no impunity.  To save face with the public they call people ""heroes"" and ""thank them for their service"".

If 90% of jobs were being performed safely, that would leave only 10% that need to be prioritized.  The remaining 90% would just continue to be performed as is until vaccine rollout is complete.

I don't think most people have the hubris of thinking that their occupation is SO much more important than the next guy; they're just exhausted from being forced into unsafe work conditions and want a way out.

**The conversation needs to veer back to the source of the problem:**  We have a government that botched the COVID response.  We have a government that continually prioritizes the profits of businesses over it's employees.

Sure change is always theoretically possible, but the amount of cultural u-turns America as a whole would have had to take to achieve China/Australia/New Zealand levels of collective action are too many. 

I have no personal experience with Australia and New Zealand, but I am Chinese and have family in China. 

With regard to China, I can promise that their culture is about as different from anywhere in America as it gets and that additionally, the virus is not near zero across the entire country.

 My relatives are from northern China near Beijing, and they still hear of extremely localized outbreaks, such as in 1 or 2 apartment buildings across the city. If there is a single case in that apartment building the apartment building is hard quarantined, full stop. Wuhan style, with the door locked, and everyone's health code automatically updates to signal that they are exposed. Additionally, there was initially help with delivery of groceries from community centers for the quarantined buildings, but that has long since stopped. My uncle has repeatedly told my dad that he tries to hoard extra grains and rice whenever possible, in case his family is quarantined for an indefinite period of time. The biggest difference is that Chinese citizens are extremely accepting of this, kind of like ""it is what it is."" 

Also, they are not vaccinating the elderly in China, and there is no timeline for when that will change. My grandma in China, who is 80, does not have a clue when she will get a shot, nor do any of her elderly friends. For that matter, I have no actual idea who is getting vaccinated, as my uncle, aunt, and cousins (varying ages and professions from early 20s to early 50's) all do not have vaccines or a timeline for them.

Doctor's make the decision to implement a DNACPR order early in a patients treatment and so many factors go into making this decision. It is borderline slanderous to imply that doctors make this decision solely on whether or not the patient has learning difficulties.

No. They're not. Full stop.

SOME of the steps include medical and scientific experts. OTHER steps do NOT include subject matter experts.

This is really not a very difficult concept and I don't know why you can't seem to wrap your head around it.

Imagine this. You have 4 balls in a line. SOME of them are red, and SOME are yellow. If I tell you to pick up the red balls, and you pick up ALL the balls - including the yellow ones - that's incorrect. Because even though they are all balls, only SOME of them are red.

Moving over to this scenario. There are multiple signoffs. SOME are signoffs by experts in immunology, pandemics, and other related subject matter experts. OTHERS are not - they're signoffs by political appointees (in the specific case we're talking about the person is a cancer specialist - NOT an expert related to pandemics whatsoever.)

I am highly educated and I’m sorry that you have taken this difference of opinion so personally.

Right now, the vaccine you get depends on which vaccination site you get an appointment at. Vaccination sites all use the same vaccine so that you can get your first and second dose at the same location without potential for mix-up. I expect this to continue to be the case going forward when the J&amp;J vaccine gets rolled out.

At least in New York, some site signups advertise which vaccine type they use, and some of them don't. I expect all vaccination sites to acknowledge in advance whether or not you will need a followup appointment, which will be an easy indication for whether you are getting J&amp;J vs Pfizer/Moderna.

Incidentally, right now, there's a pretty easy rule of thumb for figuring out which sites use what vaccine. Fixed location mass vaccination sites run by the state or large cities as well as large hospitals are mostly using Pfizer because they are able to handle the special shipping logistics and freezer storage requirements efficiently. Pharmacies, urgent cares, community health centers, and other smaller vaccination sites are mostly using Moderna because it can be stored in ordinary freezers and they don't need to set up all the special freezers for Pfizer just for a small number of people getting vaccinated at each site. I don't know exactly how the J&amp;J vaccine will change things, but it has even simpler storage requirements than Moderna (doesn't even need to be frozen), and the lack of followup appointments means you can use it for hard-to-reach populations that will have trouble with tightly timed followup appointments.

I just figured that because these are the two states with the most confirmed cases per capita and one of the highest numbers of vaccines distributed per capita they would be closest to herd immunity. But it seems like things are beginning to spread there again, but it's also too soon to tell if the trend will hold or this is just some weird blip. Maybe it's just a result of people there feeling like with cases down and many vaccinated its anything goes now and that is causing more infections.

That's the math. While ""lockdown"" might not as effective as one would imagine (probably because people flout the rules,) reducing exposure opportunities absolutely affects the rate of spread--that's what it means for a disease to be contagious; you don't catch a virus unless you are exposed to it. If we don't reduce exposure opportunities adequately, there will be a final surge. How rapidly it is spreading affects the amount of time it will take for more competitive variants to dominate. The reason ""goal posts"" are ""mobile"" is because the course of the pandemic is affected by our collective actions. That's my point. If we can hold back the variants' spread through limiting exposure until enough people are vaccinated, there won't be a fourth surge. 

You can think that it's best to err on the side of less economic/psychological impact and that risking an extra 100,000 deaths if we fail to keep R below 1.0 is better than more certainly saving those lives but risking greater economic impacts. I don't agree but that is a logical position. What isn't an opinion based in reality is to insist that our collective actions, whether influenced by policy or personal responsibility, don't have an impact on the number of people who get sick and die, and to pretend that all precautions do is cause collateral damage with no benefit. That just defies how infectious disease works.

We are close to vaccinating all of the most vulnerable in the US as well, and ramp up of the mRNA vaccines are in full swing.  Waiting a little longer might just mean waiting a couple of weeks.

Both looked the same when you don't have testing. Ask any doctor if they can look at you and tell if you have covid or flu without a test. Please dont believe me.

What a fanatic experiment we watched.  The flu was stopped when we stopped people flying to and from Asia for a year.  This year the drop off was because we stopped flights from Asia which we could never test what would happen.

""American Airlines, Delta, and United all announced suspensions of service between the United States and China.""

""Most influenza viruses that infect humans seem to originate in parts of Asia"" 

""Russell said that he and his colleagues found that each year since 2002 new strains of influenza A (H3N2), the most infectious variety of seasonal flu, originated in ""the east and Southeast Asian circulation network,"" which spans from Malaysia and western Indonesia to Korea and Japan. The virus showed up in Europe and North America six to nine months later—and then continued on to South America.""

The issue is that it is proposing fixed dates up to several months in advance when certain restrictions can be lifted. Infections and deaths are likely to decline, but it is not possible to predict what the numbers will look like more than a month in advance. Infection spikes are theoretically possible as well.

  
There is the possibility that infections decline more rapidly than expected, which means that the fixed dates are too cautious. On the other hand, there might be new data to suggest that infections could go up, and those fixed dates can be theoretically pushed into the future. However, that just undermines public trust. The UK will also have many more people ignore the restrictions out of annoyance that the dates were changed.

&gt;What I’m trying to get across about the B117 variant is that it is vastly more contagious, and is becoming the predominant strain in numerous places,

Not according to [your own source](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.26.1.2002106) that shows that the prevalence of the new variant in the UK is actually going down at the end of the observation period, not up and the percentage of the new variant cases of all cases was above 50% for a short time. 

&gt;  including Ireland (need a source for this too, or can you google it?). 

Yes, it would be nice to get a source for that. I actually tried to google information on the proportion of the new variant in the UK (the data in your earlier paper finished in December). I couldn't find anything useful. If you have some data, please share. (This is something I don't understand that you seem to think that information is some valuable commodity and that if you share your sources with others, it means that you lose something in it). 

&gt; This trend means that the 2 vs 3 comparison you uphold with the flu is misleading. 

Possibly in the future, not currently (which the top discussion applied to). On the other hand, if we talk about future, then the herd immunity due to vaccinations will start to take effect in the coming months which then means that the whole number may be completely irrelevant (a bit same thing as measles R0 when the vast majority of the population is vaccinated).  

&gt; Furthermore, with the nature of exponential growth, a “similar” ratio in R0 does not equate to similar rate of spread. 1.5 vs 2 makes all the difference.  

I'm not sure what you mean by ""difference"" here. The key value is R0=1 and our NPI methods have been aimed to push it below that. Now the next question is that do the NPI methods lower different ""natural"" R0 values similarly or is there a difference. So, for instance, if some method lowers R0 by 30-40% (as according to [this](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/early/2020/12/15/science.abd9338.full.pdf) closing schools and universities does) it would have a bigger effect on high R0 disease than low R0.",,,1614176840,{},gol27d2,False,t3_lqgjq0,False,False,t1_gokwntp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lqgjq0/not_a_single_case_of_flu_detected_in_england_this/gol27d2/,1614325271,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

 [New California Variant More Contagious, Two Studies Confirm - The New York Times (nytimes.com)](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/23/health/coronavirus-california-variant.html)   


Some choice quotes:  


 “I’m increasingly convinced that this one is transmitting more than others locally,” said William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who was not involved in the research. “But there’s not evidence to suggest that it’s in the same ballpark as B.1.1.7.”   - So there's no evidence it's even as bad as the UK variant.  


""Reviewing medical records on 308 cases of Covid-19 in San Francisco, Dr. Chiu and his colleagues found that a larger percentage of people had died from the new variant than from others. But that result could be a statistical fluke: There were only 12 deaths in the group, so the difference in deaths from one subgroup to another may not hold up in a larger sample.""  


""Still, the variant’s effect on immunity seems to be much smaller than that caused by a variant from South Africa called B.1.351. Dr. Chiu said it’s not clear if the vaccines in use will be any less effective against B.1.427/B.1.429.

“If we can get enough people vaccinated, we will be able to deal with these variants simply because we won’t have ongoing transmission,” he said.""  


Oh, so it's likely less of a concern than the SA variant.

&gt; These results are in line with another study... they were 82 percent less likely to contract an infection compared to recruits with no previous infection.

82-83% protection means having had covid before is as effective at preventing infection as a vaccine. Furthermore, the latter study found 10-fold decrease in viral load among people who were infected a second time, they were positive a shorter duration of time, and were more likely to be asymptomatic.

Having already had covid is as good as being vaccinated.

--50% of all coronavirus samples that were subjected to genetic analysis in the state.--
Notice how it doesn't say 50% of all cases but those subject to genetic analysis - those are not the same and more likely caused due to a variety of reasons beyond it being more contagious or worse.

--Samples collected from a range of counties, and using a variety of collection methods, suggest the variant is 19% to 24% more transmissible. But in some circumstances, its advantage was much greater: In one nursing home outbreak, B.1.427/B.1.429 spread at a rate that was six times higher than that of its predecessors.--

Notice the change in comparisons. The 1st part of the paragraph is about the allegedly more contagious California variant but the second part is about the UK variant. 

--In a UCSF lab, scientists found that the L452R mutation alone made the California strain more damaging as well. A coronavirus engineered to have only that mutation was able to infect human lung tissue at least 40% more readily than were circulating variants that lacked the mutation. Compared with those so-called wild-type strains, the engineered virus was more than three times more infectious.--

Notice how the use the language of the engineered virus in a lab and applying it lung tissue. There are a host of issues with this. The newspaper is applying a real world scenario to the lab. Lab studies are important but shouldn't be used as applicable in the real world.

--That’s a reminder that, if given the continued opportunity to spread, SARS-CoV-2 will keep looking for ways to thwart our effort to suppress it, he said.--

Still, remember those side effects are signs the vaccines are working.

&gt;In the vernacular of vaccinology, vaccines that trigger a range of transient side effects in a lot of recipients are known as reactogenic.  
&gt;  
&gt;All of these vaccines — in fact, most if not all the Covid-19 vaccines that have reported data so far — fall into the reactogenic category.   
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;The most common side effects are injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, and joint pain. Some people in the clinical trials have reported fever. **Side effects are more common after the second dose**; younger adults, who have more robust immune systems, reported more side effects than older adults.

The virus is serious business.  It kills people.  It makes people sick for a long time. Some people lose their sense of smell/taste. Some people don't get sick at all, but we have *no idea* who or why. Yes, I'm ignoring the age distribution stuff here, but we know that people of every age *can* get really sick.  I really don't want a loss of smell or taste to happen to me.  That's what keeps me motivated to mask up and distance.  I don't think you should ignore the danger of the virus, *at all*. 

Just because you've decided not to distance or follow the rules, doesn't mean that you get to make that decision for other people too.  Respect their choices, even if they're *terrible* choices.  You can be *so ignorant, on purpose,* just to spite me and there's nothing I can do about it. Some people have chosen to stop distancing once they're vaccinated, and that's fine, so long as they respect other people's choices.  This extends to wearing a mask.  I usually wear a mask outdoors around other people (in part) because I want to respect their choice to be extra careful.

[The virus wasn't made in a lab.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lpq0v7/i_was_the_australian_doctor_on_the_whos_covid19/)  That idea is conspiracy theory garbage, and you know it.  Even if it was made in a lab, so what? Who cares? What does that do for you?  What does that do for humanity, or our ability to fight the virus, or the people who've lost a loved one? Nothing but spread hate. Give it up.  

If you think this is me ""defending"" China, you're beyond help.

About me - I'm not ""anti-lockdown"" or ""pro-lockdown"".  In the US, I don't think we've had a ""lockdown"", we've just had restrictions, and minimal ones at that. If we had had a lockdown like in NZ or China, I do think we'd be in a better place (fewer deaths). On the other hand I'm not *totally* convinced that they are as effective as some people think. I will encourage people to ""follow the rules"" or guidelines or whatever.  Masking up is so easy, and yeah, it can suck, but just do it until you don't have to anymore.  I'm ""pro-mask"" but only to a point. They do seem to work, for a myriad of reasons. Double masking is dumb, but the idea comes from good intentions. Experts are trying their hardest, heck, [trying every crazy idea that they can](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/llsmnp/singledomain_sarscov2_s1_and_rbd_antibodies/) to protect people from a deadly virus.

The baby was very sick, for one. Most infected kids barely show symptoms and even the hospitalized ones tend to have mild cases.

&gt;But the real surprise came when doctors measured the infant’s viral load. It was 51,418 times the median of other pediatric patients. And when they sequenced the virus in the baby recently, they found a variant they hadn’t seen before.

&gt;Jeremy Luban, a virologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, said the viral load in the infant’s nose “in itself, is shocking and noteworthy.” However, he was cautious in speculating that it “could be because of N679S, or simply because it is a [newborn] with an immature immune system, permitting the virus to replicate out of control.” In the United States, doctors at several major medical centers reported a holiday surge in hospitalizations of children that paralleled what happened in adults, and a January and February spike in cases of MIS-C — a rare but potentially fatal post-viral syndrome associated with covid-19 that occurs four to six weeks after a coronavirus infection. Alan Beggs, a genomics expert at Boston Children’s Hospital, said the fact that N679S appears in the database — which represents a tiny portion of the virus circulating in the world — suggests that “this variant is present in some significant percentage of the population in this area.” He also said there was evidence that the eight cases had a common genetic background, indicating that all “were originated from one patient initially somewhere in the region.”",,,1614121943,{},goiqksn,True,t3_lqvyow,False,False,t3_lqvyow,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lqvyow/new_covid_variant_in_baby_with_high_viral_load/goiqksn/,1614284189,19,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In my opinion, it is. A healthy 20 something-year-old is in no rush to get the vaccine. Lying about being a healthcare worker or some other profession that currently qualifies for the vaccine, at a time where doses are still VERY limited, is morally wrong. This is because by making an appointment, you are literally taking that dose AWAY from one of these essential workers when there aren't enough doses for everybody. 

I'm wondering what other people think, or if I'm totally wrong here. My friends seemed kinda annoyed that I told them I felt like their plan wasn't a kind or right thing to do. Am I wrong?

Theoretically, corona vaccines should be quickly adaptable to the new mutations, but how does it look in practice? The procedures for this are currently being prepared; it should run similarly to the flu vaccination.

The number of cases of the so-called British mutation B.1.1.7 is increasing across Germany. This threatens the longed-for easing of the current lockdown, but does not concern the vaccination experts. So far, the approved vaccines against this variant of the SARS-CoV-2 have shown the same effectiveness as against the wild type. B.1.1.7 is more contagious, but not more resistant. The situation is different with the South Africa mutation B.1.351. This variant can partially escape vaccine protection due to the change E484K. Do the vaccines need to be adjusted and how long would it take?

VACCINE APPROVAL: LABORATORY VALUES SHOULD ENOUGH

The invited experts calm down fears during a press conference at the Science Media Center. In the case of the Biontech/Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines, adjustment would take about six weeks. The conversion of production would take another six weeks. And the type 2 approval process currently being planned for this should be based on that of the flu vaccines, which are adapted annually, says Klaus Cichutek, President of the Paul Ehrlich Institute responsible for drug safety in Germany.

""The prerequisite is that the production runs the same and that there is a consistency with the approved vaccine. Then no further preclinical tests with animal models are necessary, but only a small study with humans, which has to prove that the modified active ingredient is just as effective as the vaccine original, "" he explains. However, the effectiveness is not measured as laboriously as in the clinical phase 3 studies, where the researchers have to wait months for random illnesses from Covid-19. Rather, it should be sufficient to detect sufficiently high titers of neutralizing antibodies in blood samples. The entire procedure, which is currently being discussed with the European Medicines Agency (EMA), should take a few months.

CUSTOMIZATION NOT STILL SENSIBLE

The PEI President cannot yet say when this change will take place in practice and how the decision will be made. ""It happens very quickly at a certain point in time. Until then we have to continue to vaccinate with existing vaccines."" Even if the South African mutation leads to more frequent infections in vaccinated persons, the following still applies: ""Vaccination with the vaccines approved up to now is definitely better than no vaccination.""

Uğur Şahin, head of Biontech, considers the desired procedure to be appropriate. However, he cannot yet say when it will be adjusted. ""First we have to clarify in the laboratory how a modified vaccine works. And there are currently still different types of viruses in circulation, so it doesn't help us if a vaccine works against the mutation, but the previous wild type is no longer sufficiently neutralized.""

VACCINATION AGAINST MUTANTS AS AN UPDATE

One method of immunizing against the mutation is likely to be another booster vaccination. This means that people who have already been vaccinated would receive another injection with the modified vaccine. That would have several advantages. ""In the laboratory we see in blood samples that the higher the titer of neutralizing antibodies is after a vaccination, the lower the decrease in effectiveness compared to the mutants,"" says Şahin. Another boost, a booster vaccination, would definitely increase the protective effect.

For the mRNA vaccines, the immunity that has already been built up is not a problem either. The antibodies are directed against the corona spike protein, not against the vaccine and its lipid envelope. Therefore, further booster vaccinations can find their way into the right body cells.

COMBINATION OF DIFFERENT VACCINES ON THE RESEARCH AGENDA

Anyone who has been vaccinated with other vaccines - such as the Astrazeneca vector virus - can in all probability still be refreshed with the adapted mRNA vaccinations. In general, the research under the heading ""Mix and Match"" should soon clarify how different vaccines could be combined with one another. Studies on this have already been initiated in the United Kingdom, and more could soon follow in Europe, says Cichutek.

Basically, there is initially no evidence that a mix of different vaccines could be a problem, says Marylyn Addo, infectiologist and study director at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. But of course the effect would have to be clarified in studies. ""That is an integral part of the clinical development program,"" she says. That would be an advantage for many who currently have concerns about being vaccinated with the Astrazeneca vaccine, because the studies showed it to be somewhat less effective than the mRNA vaccine. ""It's as if you start a vaccination course with one vaccine now that other vaccines are automatically excluded.""

Vaccination for pregnant women and children

For Biontech boss Şahin, the top priority is currently to deliver enough vaccine so that everyone can be vaccinated by the end of summer. In addition, the vaccinations should also be made available for children. A study with pregnant women has just started and is also still an issue for patients with weakened immune systems. ""We have to understand what the immune responses look like in these cases,"" he says.",,,1614120571,{},goinrd7,True,t3_lqvdem,False,True,t3_lqvdem,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lqvdem/biontech_head_recommends_booster_shot_against/goinrd7/,1614282718,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

AstraZeneca  confirmed that it aims to deliver the number of vaccines in line with its contract with the European Commission.  


A spokesperson for the Company, said: ""AstraZeneca confirms today that its most recent Q2 forecast for the delivery of its COVID-19 vaccine aims to deliver in line with its contract with the European Commission.   


""As per this contract, approximately half of the expected volume is due to come from the EU supply chain, while the remainder would come from its international supply network. At this stage AstraZeneca is working to increase productivity in its EU supply chain and to continue to make use of its global capability in order to achieve delivery ==&gt; of 180 million doses to the EU in the second quarter.""

Responding to earlier reports from the news agency Reuters that AstraZeneca would be further reducing its supply of doses to the EU in the second quarter of this year, a European Commission spokesperson said the EU expects improvements in the supply of vaccine doses from AstraZeneca as discussions continue between the EU and the pharmaceutical company.

The commission spokesperson said: ""Discussions on the AstraZeneca delivery schedule are ongoing.

The EU has not disclosed how many doses were exported. It is said to be a few million. 

Why did they do this? Because the doses would have been wasted otherwise. The vaccines were ready to go and to be used before the infrastructure was in place in Europe to actually start vaccination and use all the doses. Sounds crazy right? But unfortunately it's quite true. The vaccines that were exported were majority Pfizer with crazy temperature requirements that couldn't really be met, then there was the question of getting people to accept to be vaccinated, which was a long process at first in many European countries. 

The EU has failed itself. Exporting a few million doses is irrelevant when you need just shy of 800 million for your population.

Friends all tried to warn me
But I held my head up high
All the time they warned me
But I only passed them by
They all tried to tell me
But I guess I didn't care
I turned my back and
Left them standing there

All the burning bridges that have fallen after me
All the lonely feelings and the burning memories
Everyone I left behind each time I closed the door
Burning bridges lost forevermore

Joey tried to help me find a job
A while ago
When I finally got it I didn't want to go
The party Mary gave for me
When I just walked away
Now there's nothing left for me to say

All the burning bridges that have fallen after me
All the lonely feelings and the burning memories
Everyone I left behind each time I closed the door
Burning bridges lost forevermore

Years have passed and I keep thinking
What a fool I've been
I look back into the past and
Think of way back then
I know that I lost everything I thought I that could win
I guess I should have listened to my friends

All the burning bridges that have fallen after me
All the lonely feelings and the burning memories
Everyone I left behind each time I closed the door
Burning bridges lost forevermore

Burning bridges lost forevermore

These findings are consistent with what we know about vaccines and transmission in general.

This is very encouraging. Based on these studies it seems like Pfizer and Moderna are at least 86% effective against infection and transmission. But it's important to remember that it doesn't mean the other vaccines are as effective in reducing transmission, if at all. I remember reading somewhere that AstraZeneca is only 27% effective against asymptomatic Covid. I don't know about J&amp;J but since it's only 67% effective in preventing **moderate disease**, so my guess is that its effectiveness against infection and transmission is more similar to AstraZeneca's.

I fully believe there can be lingering effects from moderate and even mild cases of COVID, and I don't want to downplay how draining and stressful it must be for the minority of people who get not-terribly-severe COVID and then have months of lingering fatigue that affects them badly. But even ignoring whether or not this study actually says anything about the types of cases J&amp;J would consider mild, none of this really makes me think that huge numbers of people with mild COVID symptoms are really likely to be experiencing *debilitating illness* ten years out, whereas the people who refused a vaccine for two months and got severe COVID could end up hospitalized or dead and if they survive are much more likely to have REALLY serious medium/long term complications we have seen, including life-threatening complications like predisposition to organ failure. And considering I'm fully expecting that we will end up getting booster shots for variants and/or renewing immunity within a year so it will probably be possible to get an RNA shot later even if you don't now, and COVID is probably at its peak now pre-vaccine availability and will be harder to catch a few months from now, being fully unprotected for a couple months seems waaaaaay worse to me than having somewhat reduced protection for a year.

This is much lower than average for this point in the season and lower than rates for any season since routine data collection began in 2005, including the low severity 2011-12 season.

That is, I have as much right to live as you do, and you have as much right to live as my grandmother does. And our society should strive to ensure that we enjoy those rights equally.

COVID impacts those rights unequally across populations in many ways, but for purposes of this conversation, most acutely in the area of mortality. My grandmother is several times more likely to die or be severely hurt by COVID than I am, so COVID represents a greater infringement on her right to life. If it's incumbent on society in general to ensure equal enjoyment of the right to life, then allowing people whose rights are most threatened by COVID to be vaccinated first vindicates that duty.

The virus is serious business.  It kills people.  It makes people sick for a long time. Some people lose their sense of smell/taste. Some people don't get sick at all, but we have *no idea* who or why. Yes, I'm ignoring the age distribution stuff here, but we know that people of every age *can* get really sick.  I really don't want a loss of smell or taste to happen to me.  That's what keeps me motivated to mask up and distance.  I don't think you should ignore the danger of the virus, *at all*. 

Just because you've decided not to distance or follow the rules, doesn't mean that you get to make that decision for other people too.  Respect their choices, even if they're *terrible* choices.  You can be *so ignorant, on purpose,* just to spite me and there's nothing I can do about it. Some people have chosen to stop distancing once they're vaccinated, and that's fine, so long as they respect other people's choices.  This extends to wearing a mask.  I usually wear a mask outdoors around other people (in part) because I want to respect their choice to be extra careful.

[The virus wasn't made in a lab.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lpq0v7/i_was_the_australian_doctor_on_the_whos_covid19/)  That idea is conspiracy theory garbage, and you know it.  Even if it was made in a lab, so what? Who cares? What does that do for you?  What does that do for humanity, or our ability to fight the virus, or the people who've lost a loved one? Nothing but spread hate. Give it up.  

If you think this is me ""defending"" China, you're beyond help.

About me - I'm not ""anti-lockdown"" or ""pro-lockdown"".  In the US, I don't think we've had a ""lockdown"", we've just had restrictions, and minimal ones at that. If we had had a lockdown like in NZ or China, I do think we'd be in a better place (fewer deaths). On the other hand I'm not *totally* convinced that they are as effective as some people think. I will encourage people to ""follow the rules"" or guidelines or whatever.  Masking up is so easy, and yeah, it can suck, but just do it until you don't have to anymore.  I'm ""pro-mask"" but only to a point. They do seem to work, for a myriad of reasons. Double masking is dumb, but the idea comes from good intentions. Experts are trying their hardest, heck, [trying every crazy idea that they can](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/llsmnp/singledomain_sarscov2_s1_and_rbd_antibodies/) to protect people from a deadly virus.

That's fine (and understandable).. but nobody is expecting anyone to do that for Covid either. (There's no recommendation to ""hide in a closet with a blanket over your head, cowering in shaky fear!""). That's not a thing anyone is advising. Anywhere. 

It's certainly possible to go out side and ""live your life"" (unless people think ""live your life"" means ""do any irresponsible thing you like!"".. which then No. .you shouldn't be doing that).

Except for the most part,. those choices don't have any ""pandemic-effect"" that will kill other people (not in the same way a infectious respiratory disease does). If you decide to wrap your Ferrari around a telephone pole going 200mph... great,. that's on you.

Not even of prenatal care, much less a flu shot, or paid sick days for contagious workers.

The very idea that COVID shots should suddenly be an exception to deep-rooted ""inequality of enjoyments"" that is the standing rule in this arena is quite something to see here. The astonishing thing is not that it was disregarded or circumvented in a few cases, because black markets are an inevitable feature of supply constraint. It's that COVID egalitarianism ended up as a social consensus, and that inequalities are being reported as outrageous, and that the so-called ""violations"" are so few.

In this instance, it seems as if at most a few thousand person-weeks of vaccination were misdirect--out of hundreds of millions. It's a minuscule level of abuse; a fraction of what is the ongoing incidence of insurance and Medicare fraud.

Yes I understand the outrage, I don't need to be convinced of the principle; if anything, I'm far off to the left in my opinions on health care access. Nevertheless, I think in context, COVID care has established a completely new concept of health care equality for the US: one which sees equal access to health care as a net social benefit to the common wealth.

Sure, but the vast majority of those mundane things we've come to deal with are:

* stuff that people take sensible precautions around. (again.. things like ""wearing your seatbelt"" is a pretty common and understood thing.

Covid has killed over half a million people already. So I think we're well past the ""it's different"" threshold. (not to mention the fact that we don't know how mutations, etc will pan out in the big picture. 

92 of the worlds poorest countries have vaccinated only about 1 to 2% of their populations. Those are also the most likely places where mutations are most frequent and prevalent. And it doesnt take much for those mutations to hop on a plane to the 1st world.

Let's use people vaccinated with at least 1 dose of any shot, by 2 weeks before the date as the metric, since it takes a couple weeks for immunity to start building.


Bad weather across the country disrupted our vaccination but we should bounce back up to where we were - and probably even accelerate as supply increases, but let's say we just get back to averaging 1.7M doses per day. And let's assume 60% of shots going forward are first shots (taking into account all J&amp;J shots will be first shots since it's a 1-dose shot). Right now 44.5M people (13.5% of the population) have had 1 shot.


By Memorial Day, that will increase to 129M people protected, 39% of the country.


By the official start of summer, that will increase to 50M people protected, 45% of the country.


Now consider that most everybody over 60 and people with serious health conditions will be vaccinated. And consider that probably 35% of the country has some level of immunity from having had covid already, so a majority of people will have some level of immunity, putting serious brakes on how much it can spread. And that covid clearly spreads less readily in the summer than in the winter. And that the rate of vaccination probably increases, so these are conservative estimates.


Covid isn't going to be GONE this summer. But it's going to be massively reduced in how big a threat it is.
