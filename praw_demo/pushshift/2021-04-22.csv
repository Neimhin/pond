But now scientists believe the variant consists of more mutations: E154K, P681R and Q1071H.

&gt;Viruses mutate all the time, resulting in millions and millions of new variants. However, what has made scientists worry about B.1.617 is the presence of three mutations, E484Q, L452R and P6814 – the reason why some are now referring to it as a “triple mutant” variant. These mutations have been found in other “variants of concern”, a term currently being used for the variants from UK, South Africa and Brazil.

&gt;The E484Q mutation, for instance, is similar to the E484K that was previously seen in the fast-spreading Brazilian and South African variants.

&gt;The L452R, also found in a variant first reported in California, could have immune escape, which means it could dodge antibodies induced during a prior infection or a vaccine, and therefore, show greater virulence.

&gt;The P681R mutation is similar to a mutation seen in the highly-infectious United Kingdom variant and, according to Kamil, “possibly also similar” to the Q677H mutation seen in the South African variant.",,,1619135528,{},gviach4,True,t3_mwi9ke,False,False,t3_mwi9ke,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mwi9ke/indias_triple_mutant_covid_variant_is_sparking/gviach4/,1619154319,13,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

They are not more traditional by almost any definition.  The very first adenovirus vaccine -- for ebola, made by Johnson and Johnson -- was just approved last year.  And it's been given to very few people.

Adenovirus vector vaccines are as revolutionary as mRNA vaccines.  They are brand new and unrelated to any other type of past vaccine.

Vaccines in the past were based on either:

* Attenuated viruses of the same type as the target

* Live viruses of the same type as the target

* Less-risky related viruses, like cowpox against smallpox

But they were all basically the causative agent, or a closely related one.

Viral vector vaccines are very different, and much more similar to mRNA vaccines.  The carrier virus, say an adenovirus, which generally causes a mild cold, is genetically engineered to include the gene for a protein of the target virus.  In the case of Johnson and Johnson's adenovirus vaccine for Covid, it encodes the gene for Covid's spike protein, just like the mRNA vaccines.  The adenovirus is further modified to prevent it from replicating itself.

The adenovirus then infects our own cells, causing them to pump out Covid spike proteins, just like the mRNA vaccines.

Like mRNA vaccines, adenovirus vectors have been researched and in testing for decades, but until the past few years, there were hurdles that prevented them from being used, and J&amp;J's Covid vaccine is only the second ever approved for humans, and the first was just last year, and given to only a few thousand people.",,,1619161941,{},gvjiahz,False,t3_mwixfq,False,False,t1_gvj1ojz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mwixfq/one_dose_of_pfizer_or_oxford_jab_reduces_covid/gvjiahz/,1619177008,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;1499 cases were reported via PCR test and 277 via epidemiological nexus (someone reported symptoms while living with a confirmed case via PCR test). This represents the highest amount of cases reported in a single day.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Cases have been registered in all sectors of the country, corresponding to 197,627 adults, 17,692 elderly, and 19,840 minors.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;116,686 cases are women (+942 today), and 118.588 (+834 today). 206,696 are costa ricans (+1632 today), and 28,578 foreigners (+144).

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; There has been 199.779 recovered (+400 today), and 3125 dead (+10 today), which means that the amount of active cases is 32.370. Active cases have increased by 4.40% since yesterday (+1366).  
&gt;  
&gt;

&gt;This means that 84.91% of all cases have recovered, and the fatality rate in Costa Rica sits around 1.32%. Time-dependant reproduction number estimated for today is **1.76** (R\_t)

There's a number of things that are jumping out at me here.

* The only time I've heard of solubilised chlorine dioxide being used therapeutically was when an alternative medicine nutter I once knew nagged me to read a pdf book about it, where the author made all sorts of whacky claims about it being a ""miracle molecule"" that could cure everything from toothache to cancer to HIV.

* I've never heard of the ""Journal of Molecular and Genetic Medicine"" before, and googling it I'm not finding much information about it.

* At the bottom of the page it says that the article was submitted on the 22nd February and accepted a week later on the 1st March, which seems suspicious given that it doesn't seem to be a preprint. Peer review normally takes way longer than that. Did anyone from the journal even read the article?

* The fact that the only place they were able to get ethical approval for their study, out of 'eleven American countries and Spain', was Bolivia.

* So many aspects of the way this is written don't seem **remotely** professional or scientific. I would genuinely expect a better written and presented paper from a master's student. Maybe even an undergraduate student.

* One example of that: the fact that the *one* graph they have is a couple of *bar charts* of patient age and sex. Even if that were the data that the authors should be presenting graphically (it isn't) the format is laughable.

* The fact that the researchers *and* all 20 patients knew whether they'd been assigned to the control or experimental group, leaving any changes in symptoms ripe for observer bias or placebo/nocebo effects.

* The fact that in one of their introduction paragraphs they link Bolivia's lower mortality rate vs other south American countries, without any evidence, to ""the consumption of chlorine dioxide and the massive use of traditional medicine"".

* The bizarre overstatement in their conclusion that ""we can affirm without a doubt"" that chlorine dioxide is an effective treatment. Based on a self described ""quasi-experimental investigation"" of forty patients? Really?

However, comparing the rate of blood clots between taking the vaccine and getting a blood clot if you catch covid isn’t a fair comparison. The odds of getting covid are lower than 1, unlike the odds of having the vaccine if you choose to have the vaccine. Additionally the ages of the people getting the vaccine now aren’t the ones at high risk of clots from covid.

I’m in the U.K. where the infection rate has plummeted through a combination of the latest lockdown and the vaccine rollout. If the rate of infection is now so low and there are alternative slightly (marginally) safer vaccines available in a slightly longer time frame it’s absolutely fair to be able to make that decision yourself.

Here are some relevant quotes...



“Whether mild or severe, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has shown that women are bearing the brunt of vaccine reactions, and experts believe it may be due to estrogen.”



“Another reason is the biology of a woman’s body, as estrogen produces a stronger immune reaction against the shot.”




“The side effects are usually higher in women of child-bearing age because that’s when they produce the most estrogen, she explained. And estrogen is able to stimulate an immune response by binding to immune cells and producing antibodies.”



““Estrogen doesn’t just cause you to cause antibody responses to vaccines, but it’s why women tend to have a higher incidence of autoimmune disorders, so things like lupus, rheumatic arthritis or things that are autoimmune where your body’s kind of fighting against itself. So I think there’s a real biological plausibility to what we’re seeing,” Dresser said.”



““It’s all driven by estrogen responses and hormonal responses,” she said, adding that **this side effect may have not been seen in clinical trials as a requirement for women who partake in them is that they’re not going to be getting pregnant, meaning they could be on some form of birth control.**”",,,1619178278,{},gvk0ppk,False,t3_mwfmu0,False,True,t1_gvk0cvx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mwfmu0/moderna_pfizer_vaccines_safe_during_pregnancy/gvk0ppk/,1619187356,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That is unfortunate, since scientists are just doing the best they can in a situation where they are working against the clock. It is vastly better to have this result at this point than no results at all. 

Ultimately, it is about a sense of control. When people accept the vaccine willingly, having reasonable expectations of its efficacy and safety, they are better able to make sense of the situation and be happier with whatever occurs – even if there is a rare negative result. “I made the decision, I made the call, and unfortunately it didn’t work out for me” is psychologically much more acceptable than “No one one listened or took my concerns seriously, and now I’m in this mess.”

Nothing in life is 100 per cent and bad things happen to everybody – whether or not that results in psychological trauma is dependent on a sense of control, and perhaps also a sense of belonging.

I've thought about this quite a bit recently.

Imagine trying to help people who are gasping for air for days or weeks with their last breaths, knowing there's not much you can do, for over a year straight.  An alarming number of nurses have been reporting PTSD and other mental health problems.  In Michigan, we're back at 100% ICU capacity in several major hospital systems in our current surge and I'm seriously worried for the hospital staff who really haven't gotten a break from any of this. 

It's easy to say ""ok, well if you don't want the vaccine then you get what you deserve,"" but the reality is that if people don't get vaccinated and end up in the hospital, it's still going to impact the hospital staff who have already had the most difficult and taxing jobs of just about any profession on the planet through the last year.",,,1619187752,{},gvki2b9,False,t3_mwc9v9,False,True,t1_gvida7a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mwc9v9/us_administers_2189_million_doses_of_covid19/gvki2b9/,1619197693,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I'm not trying to make excuses for anyone and I'm not trying to blame anyone, but different groups of people just tend to be more or less willing than others to get vaccinated. The United States, being a nation of immigrants from every part of the world, is more prone to that fact being relevant in our logistics and abilities. We have a large pool of very different people, so it's hard to find unity on an issue like this one since different groups of peoples have their own attitudes on pretty much every issue you can think of. I think it would be great if we could all move past those issues, but that's the reality of the situation.

Also, the issue about running out of people to take it is a bit misleading. I'm not sure if it's any different in the United Kingdom, but in the United States most people don't have any kind of outreach to get vaccinated. If you're a young, healthy American, it's on you to figure out getting vaccinated. No text messages telling you about an appointment nearby, very few spots where you can walk in and grab one, you've gotta figure out how to schedule it, go through the process of setting it up, then go to wherever- which might be hours away- and get it yourself. For people who aren't at any serious risk, a lot of them just decide that's not worth the trouble even if they'd be fine getting it were it offered to them.

And the matter of 95% of people vaccinated is also a bit of a different situation. That's referring to an older population which was exclusively eligible for a while. In the United States, everyone over sixteen is eligible, so it makes sense that we're not seeing 95%. We're seeing 80% in Americans over 65, higher than that in a lot of states, but we're just not anywhere close to 95% for our entire eligible population, and frankly the United Kingdom simply isn't going to get close to 95% of all adults either.

You have to accept that vaccine coverage will never be 100% and COVID cases will never be zero, thus this possibility is always going to exist. The best thing you can do on a personal level is get yourself vaccinated and it'll be virtually guaranteed that they can do you no harm whether they are or aren't asymptomatically spreading.

I didn't mention ""what if they spawn a new variant?"" as one of the ""costs"" that could be associated with Group B because:

 - Partial vaccine escape is going to continue to be mitigated by the protection offered from the exist shots against severe disease/hospitalization/death, which is what we really care about;   
 - Full vaccine escape is theorized to likely take years, if it's even possible at all, due to how existing vaccines target the spike protein;   
 - mRNA puts us in a position to roll out boosters rapidly;   
 - The reservoir of unvaccinated people that variants could develop in is going to be huge and remain huge internationally for several years. Whatever the size of the aforementioned ""Group B"" in the U.S. (people who won't get the shot no matter what, but will stop following restrictions if and only if public health guidance says so), I guarantee you it's a drop in the bucket compared to the billions of people around the globe that it will take until 2023 for us to get vaccinated (if at all).

Besides which... if you're concerned about the possibility of new variants hatching as the virus spreads around unvaccinated people, then entice them to get the shot by telling them life can get back to normal after.

Also, in my city it is absolutely zero issue to get an appointment for a free test within a day. If you take an rapid antigen test you have your result within 30 minutes in case of an PCR test within the next day on your phone. I agree that testing should have been implemented earlier, nevertheless, to my knowledge Germany always had a very high capacity of tests compared to other countries. Just like vaccines, masks have been scarce everywhere (despite maybe in some Asian countries where people were smart enough to wear them even before the pandemic happened - still, a Chinese friend had to send masks from Germany to her family in China during the initial outbreak) so I don't see a specific failure here.


Germany is actually one of the largest manufacturers of vaccines worldwide and with Biontech and Curevac has two of the leading companies producing mRNA vaccines. So the production capacity is definitely there.

Germans just love to criticise everything. I agree that the public image and communication of the government have not been the greatest lately (to put it midely). However, that does not take away from the fact that Germany handled the pandemic quite well when looking at actual data (death rate/capita = low, unemployment = low, DAX = all time high, never had a full on hard lockdown like e.g. the UK, etc.)

And while we are a few weeks behind the U.S. and the U.K.  in vaccinations due to several shortcomings of the EU vaccination rollout, in general, I am happy to live in a country that favors multilateral cooperation over a ""our country"" first approach.

If you want to complain about something than complain about the U.S. not lifting their export ban despite sitting on over 60 million unused doses of vaccine (their stockpile of AZ not counted).

[],,c0mputar,,,[],,,,text,t2_39fqc,False,True,[],"Here is some napkin math for my province in Canada which is in its final wave.

350,000 women are between ages of 20-29 years old.

0.25% of them will be infected weekly, but the actual infection rate is likely 2-3x more.

1 in 5000 of the infected will die in that age group.

Lets round it to about 0.35-0.5 women between ages of 20-29 dying weekly. That is fairly close to what we are seeing currently in BC, so the magnitude of the estimate is fairly accurate. It's currently closer to about 0.5 women in that age group dying per week about 2 weeks ago, when the outbreak wasn't as bad as it is now, and so we will stick with 0.5 figure which is likely being a bit conservative.

If we have the choice to vaccinate all those women immediately, then in order for less women to die from vaccinations, there would need to be a 0.00015% chance of dying from the AZ vaccine, or 1 death per 666k vaccinations.

What we know from the UK is that for every 4 or so cases of blood clotting detected, there is 1 death. We also know there is about 1 blood clot per 100,000 vaccinations among 20-29 year olds. So the death rate is 1 in 500,000 vaccinations for 20-29 year olds. This rate is the worst possible estimate, because it includes deaths from early on the vaccination program when the bloodclotting issues were unknown and/or not well treated. I suspect the risk of death is now 2-3x lower.

Nevertheless, it is now a simple case of arithmetic. If getting a different vaccine with zero risk of blood clot can be had within 1 week, then a women between 20-29 years of age should wait, assuming the other vaccines have zero risk of bloodclotting, which isn't likely. Any risk of bloodclotting among other vaccines will skew the numbers a bit in favor of taking the AZ vaccine. Regardless, in that week period, 0.5 young woman will die of COVID-19, and 0.525 will die of the AZ vaccine. So, pretty much equal, AZ vaccine is slightly edged out with my estimated figures. If we consider that it is far less likely someone will die now that the blood clotting issue is well known, the benefit of not taking the AZ vaccine pretty much vanishes.

Even if we ignore the improved diagnostics and treatments for bloodclots, if the delay before getting another vaccine is 8 or 9 days then there is no contest anymore. AZ vaccine will be more beneficial for women in the 20-29 year old age group

For 30-39 year olds, the risk of death from COVID-19 is 3-4x higher, and the risk of death from vaccination is only about 20% lower. So, if you run those numbers above, it'll be hard to stretch any set of numbers to justify waiting more than a couple days, let alone a week.

\&gt;40 year olds and older? The numbers are just completely lopsided in favor of AZ vaccine by orders of magnitude.

[],,c0mputar,,,[],,,,text,t2_39fqc,False,True,[],"Here is some napkin math for my province in Canada which is in its final wave.

350,000 women are between ages of 20-29 years old.

0.25% of them will be infected weekly, but the actual infection rate is likely 2-3x more.

1 in 5000 of the infected will die in that age group.

Lets round it to about 0.35-0.5 women between ages of 20-29 dying weekly. That is fairly close to what we are seeing currently in BC, so the magnitude of the estimate is fairly accurate. It's currently closer to about 0.5 women in that age group dying per week about 2 weeks ago, when the outbreak wasn't as bad as it is now, and so we will stick with 0.5 figure which is likely being a bit conservative.

If we have the choice to vaccinate all those women immediately, then in order for less women to die from vaccinations, there would need to be a 0.00015% chance of dying from the AZ vaccine, or 1 death per 666k vaccinations.

What we know from the UK is that for every 4 or so cases of blood clotting detected, there is 1 death. We also know there is about 1 blood clot per 100,000 vaccinations among 20-29 year olds. So the death rate is 1 in 500,000 vaccinations for 20-29 year olds. This rate is the worst possible estimate, because it includes deaths from early on the vaccination program when the bloodclotting issues were unknown and/or not well treated. I suspect the risk of death is now 2-3x lower.

Nevertheless, it is now a simple case of arithmetic. If getting a different vaccine with zero risk of blood clot can be had within 1 week, then a women between 20-29 years of age should wait, assuming the other vaccines have zero risk of bloodclotting, which isn't likely. Any risk of bloodclotting among other vaccines will skew the numbers a bit in favor of taking the AZ vaccine. Regardless, in that week period, 0.5 young woman will die of COVID-19, and 0.525 will die of the AZ vaccine. So, pretty much equal, AZ vaccine is slightly edged out with my estimated figures. If we consider that it is far less likely someone will die now that the blood clotting issue is well known, the benefit of not taking the AZ vaccine pretty much vanishes.

Even if we ignore the improved diagnostics and treatments for bloodclots, if the delay before getting another vaccine is 8 or 9 days then there is no contest anymore. AZ vaccine will be more beneficial for women in the 20-29 year old age group

For 30-39 year olds, the risk of death from COVID-19 is 3-4x higher, and the risk of death from vaccination is only about 20% lower. So, if you run those numbers above, it'll be hard to stretch any set of numbers to justify waiting more than a couple days, let alone a week.

\&gt;40 year olds and older? The numbers are just completely lopsided in favor of AZ vaccine by orders of magnitude.

There is nothing in the data that says ""It looks like we won't vaccinate enough people."" Even if we slow down at the same pace we sped up, we will still reach 70% of adults this summer. It is a safe assumption that at least a portion of the slowdown is due to the J&amp;J pause.

Additionally, any resurgence in the fall or spring will be among those who choose to not be vaccinated or kids (Assuming they won't be eligible by then, which according to Fauci they should be). Kids are at an equivalent risk of sever outcome from COVID as they are the flu. Antivaxxers have made their choice and I'm not going to alter my life to protect someone who won't protect themselves.

To preempt your ""But new variants"" argument - A variant is far more likely to 1) develop outside of the US in countries who are not being vaccinated at all and 2) evolve to become less dangerous and 3) be thwarted by the vaccine since the vaccines attack the component of the virus that makes it effective against the human body.

Thanks captain obvious.... How is this different from any other respiratory virus or how does this contradict CDC?

This is what CDC says regarding spread:

&gt;When people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe they produce respiratory droplets. These droplets can range in size from larger droplets (some of which are visible) to smaller droplets. Small droplets can also form particles when they dry very quickly in the airstream.

This is from CDC covid page:
 Important Ways to Slow the Spread

    Wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth to help protect yourself and others.
    Stay 6 feet apart from others who don’t live with you.
    Get a COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to you.
    Avoid crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces.
    Wash your hands often with soap and water. Use hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t available.

Seems like they are stating nothing false or wrong. Maybe you can argue about disinfecting surfaces and the particles forming but that extra precaution doesn't hurt anyone.

Once SPF (sun protection factor) goes over 30, the increase in protection is negligible, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation. Not too long ago, SPF went only as high as 15 or 30.

Unfortunately, high SPF can give people a false sense of security if they assume, say, SPF 70 is more than twice as effective as SPF 30, which is far from true. 

""If you look at real-world studies where people are actually putting sunscreen on, SPF 50 is probably the best in terms of getting you the protection you want,"" Board-Certified Dermatologist Dr. Bobby Mansouri said.

as a statistician, I prefer to make and disclose assumptions to facilitate calculations of probability as opposed to the current authorities' response to the question

Specificity is unknown, so yes, I had to make an assumption. 99.9% is generous in my opinion, based on the range of estimates. I haven't seen anyone claim the specificity of a PCR test is 99.99% or 99.999% as you say it may be. This will depend on CT and MIT assumes all labs use a CT of 40 like they do. This is incorrect as well as mine was 44. 

&amp;#x200B;

MIT says your positive result is real because **“we can be pretty sure that your test result is a true positive.""** They don't make any assumptions, nor make any calculations

The NYT says of a possible false positive, ""The much more likely case, however, is that you have the coronavirus and don’t have symptoms."" again, no assumptions and no calculations, but depending on your risk, this may be factually incorrect, as in my example (95% chance of false positive).

Remember the start of the pandemic? Once covid cases started cropping up in a particular location, doctors were reviewing previous patients to see whether any of them had had the same symptoms, but they just hadn't been recognised as coronavirus because they hadn't been labelled properly or the right tests hadn't been done. After all, when nobody knew that coronavirus was actually in the country, they wouldn't necessarily have known what to be looking for.

The same sort of thing happened here. When the vaccines are rolled out, a monitoring system is put in place to track adverse reactions. But with millions of doses being given out, there are all sorts of symptoms being reported and nobody knows whether any of them are significant. Eventually we start to see a repeated pattern of symptoms related to clotting, and when it becomes apparent that it's serious, the researchers comb back through the early reports to see whether there were any that simply not spotted at the time. Maybe the terminology used wasn't quite the same. Maybe the combination of symptoms wasn't quite the same. But once the researchers know what they're looking for, it's much easier to find.

If the goal is to get to herd immunity, why don’t we also look at antibodies and t-call levels of those who refuse vaccination to help us get a clearer picture?

I read an article that here in the bay area, something like 40% of nurse (or maybe 40% in a certain county) are refusing vaccination.  I’m not a nurse, but I work in healthcare and I can see why.  People who work in healthcare, who can’t do their job while socially distancing, have been catching covid at higher rates than the general popular.  5 out 6 staff members in our small Practice tested covid positive  at varying times.  One of us got sick but not seriously so, and the other four of us felt nothing out of the ordinary except 3 of us lost sense of smell/taste.  I imagine our situation is somewhat typical is most healthcare work settings that don’t specifically treat covid patients specifically.

For people in our situation, there is literally no reason to take the vaccine from a health standpoint.  We have natural immunity.  We won’t be hogging hospital beds from being sick with covid. We’re not vectors of transmission and won’t contribute to spread.  No one is getting sick or dying from us.  From a public health standpoint, if has no benefit. While from a personal health standpoint, it bears a risk.

This is why people do risk benefit analyses.  Because forcing people to take personal risks for zero benefit is insane and sounds little getting the vaccine just to get the vaccine.  Because if this is about herd immunity, wouldn’t be be talking about antibodies and t-cell immunity too?

Re: the NY Times article -- something people don't understand is that ""weakened immune system"" can mean a lot of things. The medicines people take for autoimmune diseases generally don't suppress your immune system as much as, say, cancer treatment or organ transplants or the like. (They do if you're taking steroids, though.) The NYT, afaict, is wrong lumping Remicade (used for autoimmune diseases of the gut) with cancer drugs and such. [It may just mean they need their 2nd dose before immunity.](https://crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/support/coronavirus/research-into-the-coronavirus-and-crohns-and-colitis/clarity)

No they don't. That's what they said when they were asked.

&gt;But they have contractual obligations to the UK first and foremost, due to the amount we spent, and the UK paid first. It says at such in the contract we signed.

Funnily enough, also wrong. Because apparently they were able to send 700k doses from UK production to Australia in February. Do you think the UK contract only specifies they can't supply the EU?

And if they were able to partly supply Australia, why didn't they send a single dose to any of their other dozens of customers overseas? It's blatantly obvious why: because these have been political decisions, and not commercial ones.

&gt; If they wanted to, they could simply block the export of these

To what purpose? The UK can't use those ingredients because they can't make their own mRNA vaccines. That would mean they would no longer get any Pfizer, which has been the mainstay of the UK rollout.

&gt; whereas the UK paid way more per dose

Here's the thing about the EU and UK contracts: they were signed at the same time. They both contain ""best effort"" clauses. The EU contract specifically states that nothing impedes AZ to fulfil their contract with them. The EU contract specifically lists the UK plants as manufacturing sites. So if AZ now says that they can't provide jabs from the UK to the EU, they have been lying to them from the start.

Further, it's been said many times by AZ and by the UK government, and by Oxford, that AZ sells the jabs at cost, for no profit. And yet everyone complains that the EU isn't paying enough. How do you square that circle? Are you saying that if you pay more, you get a ""better"" contract? I would call that a bribe, my friend.

&gt; Whereas the EU is actively stockpiling AZ, not using them, and blocking exports left right and centre.  

What? Complete bollocks. A handful of countries had temporary halts, a couple others have decided not to use AZ at all, but they are handing it on to others. It's a complete myth that the EU is sitting on this huge stockpile of AZ doses — they are jabbing them as fast as they can.

&gt; The EU even said they would help expand capacity, then proceeded to provide 0 funding.

That's a rumor. It's even explicitly in the contract that the EU will help AZ if they can't ramp up production on their own. But bear in mind that the EU already has provided those 340M upfront, and that AZ hasn't delivered anywhere near the target. How much more money is the EU supposed to hand over to them if they can't do anything with it?",,,1619195404,{},gvkzo1v,False,t3_mvz6yr,False,True,t1_gvktxob,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mvz6yr/eu_preparing_legal_case_against_astrazeneca_over/gvkzo1v/,1619207832,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This one is simple. Because it doesn't affect them. At this point in the US, it's pretty possible to get a vaccine if you want a vaccine. And they're the ones who have put J&amp;J on pause and refuse to approve AstraZeneca. But it's not really hurting anyone there. So there's not much to complain about.

What we've seen in a few contract tracing studies in restaurants is that you can get infected well beyond 6 feet but the closer you are in general, the more likely you are to be infected.  It depends a lot on the specifics of the ventilation system and the airflow within the room.  In these contact tracing studies, there's usually some sort of fan that is blowing air from the infected person towards the infectee.

I don't think there's been a documented case at 60 feet.

The cigarette smoke analogy is a good one.  Suppose you're in a bar with one person smoking.  If you're sitting across the table from someone smoking, and they're blowing the smoke in your face, you're going to breathe a lot of smoke.  If you're at the next table, six feet away, you'll get a lot less, but still some.  If you're 60 feet away, and there is no ventilation, eventually you will smell it just because it builds up.  If you're upwind from the person smoking, you'll smell it much less than if you're downwind.

Even though these vaccines are currently being offered only under the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization, the legal right of institutions to require COVID-19 vaccination for students seems likely to be upheld as vaccine availability increases.

That depends on who you ask. I'm sure they're hoping full authorization will be granted this summer, it's still arguable in court under EUA. Likely, colleges will give the option for distance learning, so all students have some type of option to attend.

27:27 finally back out of bed. the fatigue and aches have reduced a bit but are still there. still have a headache. chills are gone. haven't eaten anything in about 24 hours, but I've been trying to stay hydrated.

[],,Blasket_Basket,,,[],,,,text,t2_8oapds2,False,False,[],"Sure--the pandemrix issue from GSK. This was a hot-button topic that caused the scientific community to take a hard look at adjuvants (which have since been cleared from having anything to do with the narcolepsy cases). I hear what you're saying, but I don't think its necessarily as relevant as a cautionary tale in this situation for a couple of reasons:   


* This wasn't as cut and dry as it sounds. [No causal link](https://www.statnews.com/2018/07/05/flu-vaccine-2009-pandemic-narcolepsy/) was ever established, even after multiple studies. Granted, absence of evidence is not the same thing as evidence of absence--it may well be the case that it did. However, the most we can say is that the vaccine triggered a ""safety signal"" that the medical community set to pause and review. Of the hundred or so people that got narcolepsy, 90% had the same live-virus variant of the vaccine. This sounds like a lot, but it's not a smoking gun, especially since the rate at which narcolepsy occurred ended up being around 1 in 18400, and the overall population that received that vaccine wasn't that large to begin with. 
* Narcolepsy is an autoimmune disorder. The current prevailing theory for what happened here comes from a [2015 study out of Stanford](http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2015/07/side-effect-of-flu-vaccine-yields-new-insights-into-narcolepsy.html), which shows evidence for the mechanism that might have caused the narcolepsy. It turns out that this was likely a case of [microbial mimicry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3266166/), where the immune system mistakenly attacks part of the body because it shares a similar protein with the microbe in question. Narcolepsy is likely caused by the immune system attacking the hormone hypocretin. It turns out that part of H1N1 mimics a portion of the hypocretin receptor.  The portion of the virus that contained this protein was found in much higher proportion in the pandemrix vaccine than the other H1N1 vaccine out at the time (Focetria), which suggests that the pandemrix vaccine was likely responsible. However, the larger conclusion the study draws here is the link between influenza and narcolepsy. To sum it up, *there is a high likelihood that the people that got narcolepsy from the vaccine would also have gotten narcolepsy from catching H1N1.*
* The scientific community learned a lot from this episode, and the difference in test sizes between the H1N1 vaccine and the Covid vaccines are massive. By the stage 2 trials, only around 2k people had been tested with pandemrix. In the case of Covid, most studies had north of 45k. In the study linked in the original article, there are over N=36000 pregnant women, and just under a billion people have taken a vaccine worldwide. From a statistical perspective, that means the chances that the study misses anything are vanishingly small. As for the narcolepsy example you brought up, the length of time wasn't really the smoking gun here (and again, it's hard to call anything a smoking gun, because the incidence rate was small and the vaccine use was discontinued almost immediately, meaning there isn't much data to study).  The issue was having 2k people in the study. With only 2k people, it wouldn't matter how long they waited, none of those people would have developed narcolepsy, since their study had only a 1-in-9 chance of including anyone that would have had this extremely rare side effect to begin with. That's why large sample sizes are so important.

My own 78 year old mother suffered a weeklong period of rheumatoid arthritis flareup after getting an MRNA shot. She said the flareup was worse than she'd ever had, accompanied by fatigue. 

Realistically, there are adverse effects, but they rarely subject the patient to anything lasting more than 2 weeks discomfort.

My initial diagnosis was IST (inappropriate sinus tachycardia - literally fast heart rate for no reason), and unfortunately, that one has probably been with my much longer than the general dysautonomia I was later diagnosed with. I first noticed my hr was high 17 years ago when I learned how to take a pulse in my high school health class. Tried all kinds of stuff and nothing changed it, so I just dealt with it. When I got the flu in 2010, the IST got worse and I developed the other symptoms - temp regulation problems, urinary issues, digestive issues, BP issues, fatigue, etc. 

It took 6 more years to get diagnosed with IST(hr was 114 at rear the day I was diagnosed), then 3 more years to get my general dysautonomia diagnosis. My specialist retired a few months later, so I just went with my cardio to treat. Recently had a bit of a flare and need the specialist again, but it's a 6 month wait for me to get in with another one.. I'm honestly amazed people are being diagnosed so fast!

I would absolutely try flu vaccines all day if it might help. Currently I'm on 2 daily meds and countless lifestyle changes and fully expect to be dealing with this for the rest of my life (which luckily dysautonomia shouldn't impact the length of). But since I am pretty sure the IST has been around a lot longer, I just doubt it's going to help, even if the theory is true. I've also had the flu at least once more since 2010 and that caused a massive year-long flare of my symptoms that almost cost me my job.. So it seems like maybe I'd need a vaccine for every virus I've ever had. Again, I'm on board, just doesn't seem likely.

This reminds me - I have no clue how it all works, but your wife may be more likely to develop pots again.

3. India always has the option of going to other 200 countries, Why dependent on the USA though?
4. The USA has seen 500K deaths and twice the number of cases so they have the full right to support their own people. Biden has announced a plan to vaccinate 100% of the USA by 4th July so his companies are working on it.
5. India got serious about raw materials only when the situation was getting totally out of control. Then they blamed it on the USA instead.

So it isn't that they want vaccinated people to still be fearful they will catch it rather the more people vaccinated the lower chance of being exposed at all increasing the protection to those vaccinated and those who cannot be vaccinated yet. Scientists are reluctant to give a specific number because there are so many variables but there must be a way to figure it out. 

I know people are often focused on how something impacts them directly so the strongest incentive would be ""I can go back to normal as soon as I get my shot"".

Here are some relevant quotes...



“Whether mild or severe, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has shown that women are bearing the brunt of vaccine reactions, and experts believe it may be due to estrogen.”



“Another reason is the biology of a woman’s body, as estrogen produces a stronger immune reaction against the shot.”




“The side effects are usually higher in women of child-bearing age because that’s when they produce the most estrogen, she explained. And estrogen is able to stimulate an immune response by binding to immune cells and producing antibodies.”



““Estrogen doesn’t just cause you to cause antibody responses to vaccines, but it’s why women tend to have a higher incidence of autoimmune disorders, so things like lupus, rheumatic arthritis or things that are autoimmune where your body’s kind of fighting against itself. So I think there’s a real biological plausibility to what we’re seeing,” Dresser said.”



““It’s all driven by estrogen responses and hormonal responses,” she said, adding that **this side effect may have not been seen in clinical trials as a requirement for women who partake in them is that they’re not going to be getting pregnant, meaning they could be on some form of birth control.**”",,,1619191593,{},gvkquaf,False,t3_mwfmu0,False,True,t3_mwfmu0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mwfmu0/moderna_pfizer_vaccines_safe_during_pregnancy/gvkquaf/,1619202800,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Why would you think that you know more about the long term effects of covid?

There are cases of lung scarring affecting people with mild symptoms. Cases of heart damage, kidney damage, neurological issues, chronic fatigue. All affecting young, healthy people who ‘recovered’. It’s rare, but then so are vaccine side-effects.

As for vaccines, there are no other vaccines that have long-term negative effects. Side effects happen quickly or not at all. There’s no reason these should be any different. In fact, because of how mRNA vaccines work, there’s even less reason to think they would. These vaccines aren’t that new either, they’ve been in development for a decade.

Reasons as to why blame for CoronaVirus 2nd wave is completely on Modi Government


1.  They didn't allow foreign vaccines. Said we're self sufficient with Indian. Didn't allow private firms to manufacture COVIDSHIELD or COVAXIN. 


2.  Following above they didn't increase manufacturing capabilities. SII was under contractual obligation ; they had to send 100 million vaccines but only were able to send 18 million. Following which UK filed a lawsuit against them. For imported vaccines took praise on themselves. 


3. Age cap blunder by allowing only 45+ citizens to get vaccinated. Indian Boomer population will bang thalis rather than getting a vaccine. The disinformation campaigns have been huge.


4. They didn't increase oxygen production since last year. 


5. Having paid media works wonders in dissing the ground reality but when actuality spreads like fire in form of cremations, whom will you blame then? 



6. Just imagine the first stock deal of vaccines India did was in Jan 21; while other nations did it back in May 20.

If we did, indeed, give a goal that if hospitals went below a certain utilization or elderly deaths went below a certain percent, what would we expect the public to do? They will not feel the agency. They can only keep doing what they have been doing. If they have been going out to bars, they will continue. How are they supposed to feel like they are making a big difference? Those who have stayed inside will stay inside and hope others will as well.

However, if we give a goal that each person feels like they have agency in and that goal is causally linked to the ACTUAL, REAL goal, we will see a much greater response.

People are not machines and in order to get desired results, you might need to reframe issues so that they are directly relevant and ideally have some solution that the person feels like they had a direct hand in helping with.

Personally I believe that restrictions should end some period of time after the vaccine has been widely available to all people.  I believe that this should be totally divorced from case count and even hospitalization and death count.  And it's different in different areas - for example, in Arizona, there's already been full vaccine availability for all adults for roughly a month now.  I think you wait maybe 1 more month, so that people have had plenty of time to get the shots and get through the waiting time, and then all bets are off.

The reason I believe this is simple.  The moment that you have a reasonable opportunity to get the vaccine and you decline that opportunity, it's over.  Immediately, it is no longer anyone's responsibility to protect you from covid.  It's certainly no longer the government's responsibility.  If you catch covid at any point after that, you've got no one to blame but yourself.  There will come a time where that situation describes 99.9% of all American adults.  That time is not very far in the future.  At that time, will we be at herd immunity?  Will our metrics be super low?  I hope so, but I rather doubt it, at least not everywhere.

To what? The two secondary sources who get their info from the source /u/nightcrawleronreddit gave you? Not only do your sources not back any damn thing you're saying, the first one actually says:

&gt; CDC also continues to recommend **people who have been fully vaccinated  should keep taking precautions in public places**, like wearing a mask,  staying at least six feet apart from others, avoiding crowds and poorly  ventilated spaces, and washing their hands often,"" 

Literally what nightcrawler told you. The only thing the CDC says is ok post-vaccination is gathering with other vaccinated people. So what am I supposed to respond to here? You didn't refute their statement at all. They even asked you to provide a source for your info, why didn't you dig that one up?

I found [your data](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/19/cdc-says-there-have-been-less-than-6000-breakthrough-covid-cases-among-fully-vaccinated-americans.html) though seeing as how you couldn't be bothered. Again, it doesn't say a damn thing about vaccinated people not needing to follow guidelines. It's data regarding breakthrough cases. You know that's not nearly the only statistic that matters, right?

Fauci, back in december, made it very clear that [75%-85%](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/dr-fauci-says-us-could-return-to-normal-by-mid-fall-if-most-people-get-covid-vaccine.html) of the population would need to be vaccinated for us to approach some level of normalcy. We're current at [26.4%](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/states-ranked-by-percentage-of-population-vaccinated-march-15.html). When we are already running into [vaccine hesitency](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/19/fauci-disturbing-that-some-wont-take-covid-vaccine-because-of-politics.html) and we're no where near the 75% mark, why are you acting like we're in the clear? From that last source:

&gt; ...polls suggest a **significant portion** of Americans will refuse to take the  shots, potentially **stalling that nation’s recovery** from the pandemic... 

Celebrating a win before the game is over is really, really stupid. We need continued caution while the vaccines roll out. Just suck it up and wear the damn mask. Holy fuck I can't believe people are still bitching about them.

So we had massive buyin for people on trials (including ministers) and also our healthcare is really centralised, so 
NHS contacted most people to come in. We have also engaged with religious and ethnic minority groups with lower uptake, using figureheads and personalities.

&gt;• to launch successfully the National NHS Citizen Registry for rapid trial enrolment;

&gt;• for public education to communicate simply the complexities of vaccine approach, 
progress and strategy; and 

&gt;• to establish the UK as a global leader in vaccine R&amp;D by encouraging international cooperation and to drive future economic growth. 

&gt;These communications appear professional, widespread and have given appropriate messages about vaccine expectation and the UK capability. At the time of writing, the Citizen Registry had over 360,000 registrants

That's completely fine. That's what the CDC says is ok to start doing post-vaccination; gather with other vaccinated people. The problem is that the CDC still recommends following guidelines **in public**. Which, from where I'm standing, is what you've been talking about. How am I supposed to interpret this: 

&gt; Now, if you choose to maintain extra social distancing because you feel  you need it, that's fine. It's on you. But I don't see a scientific  reason to tell everyone to keep to the same level of restrictions as  before. 

as you talking about being indoors? Everyone before you in this thread was talking about eating indoor at restaurants and shit. If deniers see vaccinated people **out in public** not following guidelines they're going to give up **whatever guidelines they've begrudgingly starting following**. 

It's not as simple as they follow them or they don't. There's been a rising level of compliance, however small. They'll give all that up in an instant once they see the 'radical left' out and about, vaccinated or not. 

You didn't answer the most important question I asked though:

Risk to self-- public health experts have determined that the risk of Corona virus vaccine is less than risk of the virus. Yes, you are correct that a young person is more likely to have mild disease. As a young person, you are also less likely to have ever experienced any type of moderate or severe disease in your life so it's harder to put in perspective.
You could have the mild Corona virus symptoms where you feel unwell for a few days. But this type of ""unwell"" is more severe than the sniffles. For example, if you are sick enough for a week that you can barely drag your body from the bed to the toilet four times a day, but you're not in the hospital, that's considered mild disease. But let me tell you, when you're actually living through that week... It feels like forever. Yes, there are accounts of 20 something-year-olds who are basically sick enough during the acute phase where they are barely making it to the toilet and back. Or cases of young people where yes they had mild disease, but for a few months after they are stopping to catch their breath after climbing one flight of stairs. That's considered mild disease. But again, actually living through the experience of going from a fit healthy person to needing to rest after a flight of stairs doesn't feel mild. It's not the ICU, It's not the ventilator, but it truly has an impact on your life. 

We also want to crush this pandemic by getting vaccinated. This pandemic has hurt and killed a lot of people, and getting vaccinated slowls infection rate in our communities. You can be a part of protecting others.

Scientists and researchers were able to develop this vaccine after using decades of research on previous vaccine and technology and test it on people in clinical trials in a big effort to see if these vaccines were safe and effective. We have many vaccines (only a few for a Corona virus) And we know that from our decades of vaccine research, the majority of long-term side effects come from within the first 90 days or so. We were able to study these during the clinical trials, and complete the clinical trials very rapidly because there was a lot of funding, many willing participants, and high levels of disease activity which made it easy to complete the clinical trial more quickly.",,,1619146938,{},gviwrgi,False,t3_mvz8fm,False,False,t1_gvislo7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mvz8fm/daily_discussion_thread_april_22_2021/gviwrgi/,1619165890,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Lower numbers could be due to small sample size or that it was with health care workers who are obviously exposed more than most.

&gt;A new CDC study provides strong evidence that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections in real-world conditions among health care personnel, first responders, and other essential workers.  These groups are more likely than the general population to be exposed to the virus because of their occupations.  
&gt;  
&gt;The study looked at the effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections among 3,950 study participants in six states over a 13-week period from December 14, 2020 to March 13, 2021.  
&gt;  
&gt;Results showed that following the second dose of vaccine (the recommended number of doses), risk of infection was reduced by 90 percent two or more weeks after vaccination. Following a single dose of either vaccine, the participants’ risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 was reduced by 80 percent two or more weeks after vaccination.  
&gt;  
&gt;It takes about two weeks following each dose of vaccine for the body to produce antibodies that protect against infection. As a result, people are considered “partially vaccinated” two weeks after their first dose of mRNA vaccine and “fully vaccinated” two weeks after their second dose.

First off, calm down. You got hot writing your response and you didn't read the whole conversation of this discussion.

&gt; If COVID infected 10 out of 100 people, then in a situation where that 100 was vaccinated only 1 person would have been infected.

Yes, literally everyone understands this. It doesn't change the fact that those 10 people are still in danger if we fail to mask up and social distance before reaching herd immunity.

&gt; It’s not 10% will still get corona. That’s not how statistics work. You have to take into account the chance of infection for it to mean anything.

You have to take that into account to reach a reliable number regarding herd immunity. This discussion is not about those 10% being in danger AFTER reaching herd immunity, it's about those 10% being in danger by the people that haven't been vaccinated that OP was saying should hear messages about masks going away and social distancing stopping when we're not there yet - purely because he thinks it will sway antivaxxers when it won't. Statistics matter, but so does the context of the post you're replying to.

&gt; AND on top of all that the 1 person who was infected isn’t getting a serious illness.

This simply isn't true. There was recently a major case where a vaccinated nurse infected the elder care center where she worked and vaccinated people died as a result.

It’s incredibly important for people to be vaccinated if they’re living in dorms which are in close proximity with hundreds of other people from across the country. Colleges are requiring this vaccine along with every other vaccine that they required for decades for students to attend the college for public safety because they don’t want people getting sick on campus while they receive a quality education one that they’re paying good money for. People go to college to get an education not to get sick with COVID-19. So schools requiring the vaccination is a logical step to protect the welfare of the students on campus herd immunity is important Both to protect every student individually but also protect those students that might be immuno compromised or allergic where they can’t receive the vaccine if it’s a medical reason why they can’t get the shot that’s understandable but for everyone else it’s necessary so that we’re protecting everyone including ourselves.

Maybe not now, not yet.

But if it's early/mid-June, first-dose vaccination is stalling out around 58%, and we're seeing the huge reduction in hospitalizations and community spread like we expect? Yeah, put that on the table.

""You can't go back to normal even after you get this shot"" is a huge morale blow and I'd bet that with the opposite enshrined, you'd be able to entice 5%, maybe 10% of the overall population off the fence.

""But then the anti-maskers will just lie about being vaccinated!""

Okay. So then what this objection implies is that it's sub-group against sub-group.

Group A: People who will be enticed towards vaccination because of the promise that they can get their lives back. They would not have otherwise bothered with the shot.

Group B: People who were following restrictions, but will do so no longer once the promise is offered to Group A. They would not have gotten the shot regardless.

Pursuant to how many people actually comprise each of the sub-groups, this becomes a question of whether the marginal benefit of Group A exceeds the marginal cost of Group B. Sort of like that [scene from Fight Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiB8GVMNJkE) (but less macabre).

What benefit do we get from Group A? More people vaccinated will do more to hamper the ability of the virus to spread. It also virtually guarantees that none of them will wind up in the hospital, the morgue, or with long-term COVID-19 complications.

What cost does Group B incur us? They might spread the virus more.

But it's not like their likelihood goes from 0% to 100%.

Just because they're following the restrictions doesn't mean they have a 0% chance of spreading the virus. Human error, risk compensation, physical limitations of non-N95/equivalent masks, etc.

And just because they stop following the restrictions doesn't mean they'll 100% start spreading. They'll be recouping some population immunity effect even if we're not at herd immunity: with 50%+ vaccinated, the virus would simply have fewer paths to them. And some portion of Group B will likely already have natural immunity.

So maybe it's something like they'll go from 20% to 65% likely to be infectious with the virus. (Just spitballing.)

So what risk of harm does this pose to the population? Once we really start hitting a vaccination plateau, the only people they can possibly spread to would be:

 - Other adults who have decided to not be vaccinated   
 - Not-yet-eligible children (who are generally at higher risk from the flu)   
 - High-risk people medically ineligible for the vaccine (unfortunate, but not a large group, not one that's ever going to have 100% protection, and one that also has to live cautiously even when it's not a pandemic)   
 - The rare vaccinated adults for whom the virus breaks through (who are virtually guaranteed to have mild or asymptomatic cases)

So does the social benefit from Group A exceed the cost incurred by Group B?

Like I said, maybe not today. But maybe in eight weeks it'll be a different story.

At that point, if we're still not willing to let go of restrictions for vaccinated people, we have to ask ourselves: which is really more important? Winning a war of behavioral control against the sub-group of dishonest anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers, or winning a war of net public health benefits versus costs?",,,1619194806,{},gvky9ya,False,t3_mwpijo,False,False,t3_mwpijo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mwpijo/daily_discussion_thread_april_23_2021/gvky9ya/,1619207042,36,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Walk ins will help that since it makes the process even easier, and I think more open and constructive discussions about ending restrictions would help that even more.

The vaccines are verified to work reasonably well against all of the variants **currently** out there (with varying degrees of evidence).

When scientists discuss the possible need for boosters, it's usually either 1) because we don't know how long protection will last, and/or 2) because they're considering the possibility that a new variant will show up that ***actually does*** reduce vaccine efficacy significantly.

\#1 looks pretty good for now, with all major indications suggesting vaccine-induced immunity lasting quite a while (but of course we won't know until we know).

\#2 is the main reason for me why ***everyone, even young/less-at-risk people, should get vaccinated***. The more we allow the virus to circulate, the more chances we give the virus to develop new mutations that could chip away at vaccine-induced immunity.

For example, let's say you want to know what the odds are of a fan at a b-ball game hitting a half-court prize shot.  You test it out by giving 100 fans 3 chances each to hit the shot. 95 of them miss all 3 shots. 4 of them hit one and 1 hits 2/3. (each fan may have their own distinct probability and some are likely better than others, but we don't know which one we're gonna get and we have only limited insight into how good each one is). 

Now we want the ""best"" estimate that a random fan will hit one of the prize shots. Using the median, we will say 0 (the median and mode are both 0%). Using the mean, we'd get  \~5%. Even the fans who missed all 3 shots, don't have a 0% chance of success. It is slightly higher (how much we don't know).

Alternatively, we could take 100 of the NBAs best free throw shooters and give them all 3 shots each. lets say 70 hit all 3, 25 get 2/3 and 5 get 1/3. what is that the best estimate of picking one of them and predicting their performance for a given free throw? the median and mode are both 100%, the mean would be 89%. I would be only 89% confident any of them will hit that free throw (even if we picked one that got 3/3 on the test run AND even if we picked the person who only hit 1/3).

As we make the test trial larger, instead of 3 shots we give them all 10 shots, we will see the distribution shift toward the 'true' representation of the middle and many players will get 8 or 9 shots, thus shifting the mode away from the bound and making the median a better representation of true best estimate. But before that happens, the median is very biased. 

Similarly, if we had huge trials for all tests, we would likely see many of them fall away from 100% specificity (it can't get any better for them since they can't get any more specific because they are bounded). But until that happens, using the median will be biased toward the bound. 

When the DOH nurse called me, I told her i am skeptical (but of course agreed to quarantine) and asked her what she thought the odds are of the repeat test being positive, given that i am asymptomatic and vaccinated. she said more likely than not. According to my calculations, much less likely than not. It turned out not. That's essentially the value in trying to do this. we want to be able to predict who can transmit the infection and who will get sick. We can never see the future with certainty, but we can hone and sharpen our understanding of probabilities to better predict the future. and we do a better job of predicting the future with a good understanding of statistical modeling (i will call this a model now, thanks).

Since children most likely won't show severe symptoms (although its still important to remember that it still has the possibility to get bad for them to) you'd think it might not be that big of a deal in general right? But there are serious things to look into, like this [study](https://www.chop.edu/news/chop-researchers-find-elevated-biomarker-related-blood-vessel-damage-all-children-sars-cov-2) showing elevated Biomarkers Related to Blood Vessel Damage **in All Children with SARS-CoV-2 Regardless of Disease Severity.**

What consequences could blood vessel damage lead to? TMA (Thrombotic Microangiopathy), or clots. It is a medical condition in which tiny blood clots damage the smallest blood vessels and it can result in injury to the brain and kidneys.

In children with cancer, TMA has been associated with an increased risk of severe illness late in life, such as high blood pressure, early kidney damage, or cardiovascular disease.

Microvascular Injury in the Brains of Patients with Covid-19.

TMA symptoms also intersect a lot with long covid symptoms - Fatigue, Dizziness, Shortness of breath, Bruises, Confusion, Sleepiness, Seizures, High blood pressure, Fever, Neurological manifestations, etc.

The migrant crisis wouldn't have been there if we had more than 4 hours warning before the lockdown. Just as how industries were given a couple of days to get their act together this time around before oxygen could be routed to hospitals, the lockdown could have been done in a planned manner. 

With a whole year to prepare, we could have actually gotten our act together. We were so stubborn about just using Indian vaccines that we missed the chance to push our vaccine drive even further. We could have planned better. Even while experts were warning of a second wave, many major cities shut down covid care centers with beds numbering into the thousands. Even were beds were available, there was barely any preparation for emergencies. And this is after the crisis we saw last year where in some hospitals dead bodies were in the same ward as those living because the morgues were full. 

The main thing is, we don't listen or learn. Politicians are stubborn and arrogant, people don't follow directions unless a cop is around and we were overconfident. And the money that was contributed towards managing the pandemic has disappeared. Blind faith in ourselves, rituals or traditions is our downfall.

I would just really like some help because Im open to receiving the vaccine but I’m still unsure on the actual mechanisms I’ve head recently compared to what I learned in class. 

So my understanding as it was taught in college is that the standard vaccines we get every year are essentially dead microbes that our immune system eats up and produces antibodies and later stores the information so that if it’s ever detected again, the body can make new antibodies and the response curve is drastically shortened when compared to a new infection.  The body does not constantly have a large supply of these antibodies moving around and depends on other elements of the system to create new ones. Yet I’ve heard that these vaccines make us immune by having enough antibodies constantly around to attach to any covid viruses that happen to get into us. 

Now I’ve kept hearing is that if your infected with covid that you’re not protected after about 6 months, which contradicts the idea that our immune system remembers nearly everything it’s fought, I know that measles is one of the few diseases that can actually make your immune system forget all that it’s ever fought before. Obviously nobody is immune after getting infected the first time, but regardless this idea that we have to be immune to ward off covid has me confused as our bodies can successfully fight off other infections if it’s encountered it before. 

I would really like some clarification because news articles generally can’t answer my questions the same way someone talking to me could. I’m not antivax, I’m just wary on how some pieces of information that I’ve heard contradict what I know about immunology and would like some clarification before receiving a covid vaccine.",,,1619206445,{},gvlouqe,False,t3_mnitdo,False,True,t3_mnitdo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mnitdo/vaccine_faq_variants_chronic_conditions_nsaids/gvlouqe/,1619222148,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I talked to my doctor who suggested maybe waiting until at least 18 weeks when all of the important organ formation has finished just to be on the safe side. While there is not much long term documentation about the vaccine, there is well documented evidence that pregnant women are more likely to have complications, intubation, and death from getting Covid itself. On top of that, I’m asthmatic which also puts me at higher risk. And finally, I have a 2 year old son that I also need to think about and have weighed the option that if I get sick and possibly have worse complications or death, which we know I am higher risk for, that I could leave him without a Mom. 
TLDR: yes, I’m not a doctor, but I’ve listened to what they’ve said and weighed the risks and feel this is best.",,,1619206293,{},gvloitq,False,t3_mwfmu0,False,True,t1_gvkvfvi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mwfmu0/moderna_pfizer_vaccines_safe_during_pregnancy/gvloitq/,1619221972,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Ignoring that pausing the vaccine already implies they're making extra sure this stuff is safe, the group of people who would be willing to get vaccinated probably doesn't have much overlap with the people who wouldn't get a vaccine that was paused and then resumed.

The worst case scenario is there's a non insignificant group of people who decline the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and instead prefer one of the mRNA based vaccines. If that's the cataclysmic outcome, I don't really care honestly. Eventually the Johnson and Johnson doses will get used, give or take some that will be lost as is always the case with a wide vaccination effort, and in the meantime we can still proceed at a decent pace.

I don't think hesitancy after the pause is going to be a serious issue for our daily numbers. The pause itself already had a big impact on those numbers, resuming it can only increase them. I think if you want to worry about daily numbers, accessibility and apathy are more important targets than distrust of one singular variety of vaccine that may or may not have lost some amount of trust among people who are informed enough to know there was a pause but not informed enough to know it's reasonably safe.",,,1619193538,{},gvkvcr0,False,t3_mwyaeo,False,False,t3_mwyaeo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mwyaeo/the_benefits_outweigh_the_risks_its_time_to_allow/gvkvcr0/,1619205385,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That graph is quite optimistic with AZ because it compares COVID hospitalizations to VITT. VITT is worse than being hospitalized with COVID. It carries a mortality rate of around 20%, apart from the sequels it may have for survivors (as it's essentially a kind of stroke).

I think pages 6 and up (comparing to ICU admissions) sound like a more meaningful comparison.

Plus, while right now many (not all) European countries are at the ""high"" infection rate, with vaccinations ramping up and the summer approaching, we can expect most to trend to ""medium"" not far from now, and ""low"" in 1.5-2 months is not out of the question.

And then, you also have to take into account the time scale. This is hospitalizations in 4 months. If a person rejects AZ today, will it take 4 months for them to be offered an mRNA vaccine? I think in most cases, the answer is it will take less.

Conclusion: the graphs are really useful, but no, I don't think page 3 is the most representative of the choices most European countries have to make.

### This is not a legitimate reddit user!

This is a **scammer** trying to rip you off.  Do not buy from any links in comments or messages!

* *Scammer:* **u/dwhyte8989^^^New**
* *This Post:* [Fuck covid t shirt](https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mwy2i3/fuck_covid_t_shirt/)

## SCAMS ARE EVERYWHERE ON REDDIT

*Especially posts about...*

* **T-Shirts or Hoodies**
* **Coffee Cups or Mugs**
* **Printed masks**
* **Art prints or posters**
* **Stickers**

The post from a scammer or from a real user but have scam links in the comments. Drop-shipping scams use stolen art and third party sites to steal your money!  They will create new posts (such as this) and add scam links in the comments of actual redditors' posts.

Be careful, be safe! Don't buy from any websites you aren't familiar with and be very wary of any links you are sent, especially over chat or PM.

---

## BEWARE REDBUBBLE &amp; AMAZON LINKS
Drop-ship spam rings have started using redbubble and amazon to front their scams. While you will get a shirt when placing orders, the print quality will likely be poor as the art is stolen - and you are supporting the scammer, not the artist.

---
## FAQ

1. *I don't see any links!* Often spammers will submit the post, and upvote it with alt accounts, and wait for it to get traction before posting the link.  Or, they won't post a link directly in comments but will PM or chat message anyone who comments with a link. **If you think this is a false-positive, please comment and a human will review.**

1. *How do you know they're a scammer?* Typical red flags are newer accounts with few or simple comments, but some scammers build or buy faux-accounts to avoid detection. The best thing you can do is avoid clicking on any links that don't go to a site you're familiar with, **especially** if the link seems to come from nowhere or is from a new / low karma account.

1. *How do you know in this specific case?* Unfortunately publishing all red flags would make it easier for the scammers to hide.  If you have a question, reply to this comment and the bot's operator will respond when they are able.

1. *But someone else posted the link, not OP* Scammers will use multiple accounts to look more innocent. They also use multiple accounts to upvote posts and comments to look more supported / show higher in browsing listings.

1. *I see links to Twitter, Imgur, Google, Linkedin, and other sites. are those safe?* The link itself, yes. HOWEVER those links will most likely then redirect you to ANOTHER link that has the shirt for ""sale"". Scammers use this tactic to avoid Reddit blacklisting their scammy domain names.

The reason they did this was likely to validate that deferring people's 2nd shot at 21 days in the UK was a wise decision--in order to get more initial shots.  They're saying that in the general population benefited from it, and it was a 65% reduction.  
  
In fact, the study says: ""Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community."" and the article says ""Scientists on the team said the findings supported the UK’s decision to prioritise giving first shots to elderly and more vulnerable people by delaying second doses.""",,,1619209500,{},gvlvjyd,False,t3_mwixfq,False,True,t1_gvlp6ee,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mwixfq/one_dose_of_pfizer_or_oxford_jab_reduces_covid/gvlvjyd/,1619225751,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I definitely left room for misinterpretation, my only intended point in bringing up my parents was in regards to myself being low-risk but abiding by precautions anyway. It was not to guilt trip you into getting it, I have no interest in making that kind of argument. I'm trying to provide logical reasons and sometimes there's overlap with an altruistic argument. To be bluntly honest your stance from your initial comment sounded pretty uninformed to me, because you claimed the vaccine doesn't work. 

This all started as a discussion on vaccine efficacy anyway, and you haven't refuted a single point on those grounds, neither have you countered the point that the vaccine is safer than covid. Your only counter point is that you don't trust any of this information. Don't forget that it isn't just the US government distributing this vaccine. They are doing it on the largest scale, but dozens of countries are getting this vaccine into people's arms as fast as they can. Pfizer and Moderna submitted their vaccines for EUA at the end of last year with 2 months of safety data. Since then over 200 million doses have been used in America alone over a 4+ month period. Not to mention many world leaders have now received some form of the vaccine, including both former President Trump and President Biden. Nearly any recorded side effects from any previous vaccine were seen within 2 months of distribution. Again, it's your choice, but I'd hardly call the vaccine untested at this point. We have tons of available data with or without full FDA approval which isn't going to be done for at least the next 8 months. 

I am aware of many instances in the past causing distrust of the government and big pharma. But if you ask me this situation is out of their hands now, in the sense that the vaccine is spread simply too widely and has been in circulation for too long for there to be no huge red flags if something was truly wrong. Never before have we had a response from the medical community on this scale, and from that I truly believe we are seeing the vaccine for what it is moreso than we would have in any other scenario or at any other point in history.

However, I think the sources you've been hearing from about the vaccine have misunderstood the statement about 6 months. The makers of the vaccine found that it remains highly effective for *at least* six months; they can't say longer than that because it hasn't been distributed in big enough numbers for longer than that, but it's very very very likely it'll last significantly longer htan that -- probably at least 12-18 months in my opinion, but that is admittedly speculation.

Unfortunately, some media sources saw that press release and misinterpreted it to mean that the vaccine is *only* effective for six months, which isn't true.

So the reason that efficacy might decrease over time is that sometimes, those memory cells that can produce the antibodies just die over time or are selectively pruned away if they aren't re-exposed to the thing that they're supposed to recognize. That's a normal process, but it just means that every now and then, a booster might be needed to remind the memory cells not to die. There's also the possibility of mutation -- while it's unlikely to be a big concern in the near term, in the medium and long term, mutations could slowly reduce efficacy of the vaccine, so again, you'll need a booster to get the memory cells to recognize the new form.

Basically, it's a combination of ""no cell lives forever"" combined with ""the headlines about the vaccines only lasting 6 months are completely wrong.""

That would mean that roughly 260M of 340M already have some protection by start of may. Maybe that ups to closer to 300M by independence day. Each of the groups have differing levels of protection, from 50% to 95%, but that's a fair bit of the population covered

A couple of personal remarks:

1. I am not *principally* against vaccination. 
2. I believe there are 'good' COVID-19 vaccines.
3. I am quite *liberal* and am a strong defender on anything tainting with [bodily integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodily_integrity#Human_rights). I also believe that, if people would inform themselves on the motivations for bodily integrity in numerous international laws, regulations and ethics, a very large majority would agree this should be a fundamental right.
4. I am Dutch and seeing this topic from a European (European Convention of Human Rights) and Dutch perspective.

Now, having said that, I want to make a statement:

I believe it is widely accepted that one can *only* restrict rights when that restriction has *legal* grounds, is deemed *necessary* and is *proportionate*. Therefore, I believe it is *unjust* that threatening employees with termination when

* refusing to perform a medical intervention and/or 
* refusing to provide private medical details of said medical intervention, 

without 

* providing verifiable support that continuing their job will cause a disproportional risk to others and
* showing that no other reasonable measures can prevent this risk and
* providing the legal basis.

The question then becomes: is this the case at this hospital? Which legal grounds do they have to fire their workers based on HIPAA protected private information? 

I do not think many of us on Reddit can answer that question sufficiently well. However, the legal basis seems iffy. In addition, these kind of blanket threats might set very unwanted precedents in the future.

For the record, I believe the US has quite a different view on this than we do in Western Europe. Here (our [Dutch](https://paltheoberman.nl/en/news/458/mandatory-vaccination-for-the-employee)) legal position is more clear and better defined. 

Again, I sincerely want people to vaccinate themselves.

Compare this with the performance of Pfizer, for example, which under-promissed and over-delivered, Moderna, who promissed little and delivered what they promissed, or J&amp;J who again promissed little and they have just started to deliver.

&gt;Comparing no protection (baseline) for 20-min and 30-s exposures, it was predicted that the mean risk of infection was reduced by 24–94% and 44–99% depending on the mask. Risk reductions decreased as exposure durations increased. The greatest reduction in estimated mean risk of infection was for FFP3 masks, which reduced baseline mean risks by 94% and 99% for 20-min and 30-s exposures, respectively (Figure 1 ). Of non-traditional materials, the vacuum cleaner bag resulted in the greatest reduction in mean risk of infection (20-min exposure 58%, 30-s exposure 83%), while scarves offered the lowest reduction (20-min exposure 24%, 30-s exposure 44%) (Figure 1). However, large variability in filtration, such as for silk or the tea towel, should be considered when comparing non-traditional mask materials (Figure 1).

&gt;The chance of own infection is at about 10% after biontech and if you get infected your viral load is around 4x lower than a non vaccinated person

In the body perhaps, but the vaccine does not provide mucosal immunity, and considering the transmission routes, mucosal immunity is highly important to prevent transmission. This is why you must still wear a mask and social distance regardless if you have both doses and any amount of time passed, because you do not have mucosal immunity

(both of those from the original source I gave) 


""Based on this evidence, the researchers calculated the risk of death associated with B.1.1.7 infection. Their estimates suggest that B.1.1.7 infection was associated with 55 percent greater mortality compared to other SARS-CoV-2 variants over this time period""

Growing evidence shows that young people are not only more likely to get infected with P.1 but also to die from it, some experts have warned. The Brazilian Association of Intensive Care Medicine said that the number of 18-45 year olds requiring intensive care for covid-19 in February to March this year was three times greater than in September to November 2020,5 and coronavirus related deaths in that age group have almost doubled.

Yet the increase is higher in regions where P.1 is more prevalent, suggesting that it is not only more transmissible but also more lethal. “It is very likely that the P.1 variant is more severe among young adults,” said Portela.

A preliminary study,6 which compared case fatality rates in Manaus’s first wave of cases in April to May 2020 with the second wave in January 2021, found that deaths among people aged 20-39 were 2.7 times higher in the second wave than in the first. In the general population they were only 1.15 times higher.

The P.1 variant, which has proliferated rapidly in Brazil, thought to be more contagious than the original strain of Covid-19 and is potentially able to evade the body’s immune responses, has been detected in 28 states as of April 8, CDC data shows.

ARR = (185/14073)-(11/14134) = .0124 or 1.24%

185 is number of people who got COVID out of 14073 in the unvaccinated group. 11 is number of people who got COVID out of 14134 vaccinated group. Also, these participants weren't necessarily ""exposed"". Many of them probably stayed home, wore masks etc. That's why the % numbers are so low. 

So the absolute risk of catching COVID for unvaccinated group is 185/14073 = 1.31%. 

The absolute risk of catching COVID for vaccinated group is 11/14134 = .078%. 

So the absolute risk reduction is 1.3% (unvaccinated) - .078% (vaccinated) = 1.24%. 

Basically the unvaccinated in the group caught COVID at a rate of 1.31% and that goes down to .078% in the vaccinated group, a total reduction of '1.2%'. I'm rounding numbers so they don't add up exactly. And if you do the math, .078% happens to be 6% of 1.31%. That's why the relative reduced risk is 94% and why you see 94% efficacy. 

You have to remember that this is only for the clinical trial period. That during the trial period, only 1.3% of unvaccinated people caught COVID. That's the problem with using absolute risk. While only 1.3% caught it during the trial, life doesn't end after the trial is over. So the 98.7% who didn't end up catching COVID during the few months of the trial can still catch it later on. So the ""absolute risk"" number will change the longer the time frame. If you let the pandemic run unchecked, no masks, no vaccines, no social distancing, you better believe more than 1.3% will catch COVID. 

Relative risk reduction does a good job showing the vaccine efficacy. Absolute risk is dependent on time frame  you study and any protective measures being taken. The longer the pandemic goes on, the higher the absolute risk will trend.

Contractor: ""OK great, some people don't let us go into their house.  ""

Me:  ""I'm fully vaccinated so no worries here!""  

Contractor: ""Ah, so you are one of those people who are about to turn into a zombie.""  He was not joking.  Not that he though I would turn into an actual zombie but that the vaccine would hurt me somehow, etc. and that he certainly wasn't taking it.  

Me:  ""Well I guess if that is the case there are about to be 150 million zombies.""  He looked funny at me.

Contractor:  ""Well I'll be the one shooting them all with my shotgun.""

Me:  ""Well I guess I'll know who to look out for.""

Awkward silence for a few seconds and then we moved on. 

This guy is a business owner, presumably doing well for him self (based on how busy he said he was and how long it would take to get the work done due to demand).  He works at other people's houses all the time. etc. etc.  

This is the problem we have.  COVID is not going anywhere as 20% of the population in the USA is never going to take a vaccine.  If we have to have boosters then an even higher percentage won't take those. 

My view is if the vaccine keeps you heathy (at least to a level of risk in line with any other flu/cold/etc.) then I am going to live my life.  I think we all should.  And I am going to stop thinking about or worrying about this 20% that are not going to take it.  If the virus circulates in those populations and serious illness and death happen, at some point I cannot worry about it.  Once everyone has a chance to get a shot, I'm moving on.

On the other hand, the person who is concerned should be open and willing to listen to what experts have to say, which isn't common in these times.

The comparison is made for different age groups, for high/medium/low Covid infection rate in the community, and for estimated Covid hospitalizations/ICU admissions/deaths. 

Since the cases of VITT are all very serious but obviously don't all result in death, I think the most relevant comparison is with ICU admissions. In which case, it seems that if the country has high incidence then AZ should still be given in all age groups, and for low incidence it should be restricted to very old.

&gt;  
&gt;The acute clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are well characterized1,2; however, its post-acute sequalae have not been comprehensively described. Here, we use the national healthcare databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs to systematically and comprehensively identify 6-month incident sequalae including diagnoses, medication use, and laboratory abnormalities in 30-day survivors of COVID-19. We show that beyond the first 30 days of illness, people with COVID-19 exhibit higher risk of death and health resource utilization. Our high dimensional approach identifies incident sequalae in the respiratory system and several others including nervous system and neurocognitive disorders, mental health disorders, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, malaise, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and anemia. We show increased incident use of several therapeutics including pain medications (opioids and non-opioids), antidepressants, anxiolytics, antihypertensives, and oral hypoglycemics and evidence of laboratory abnormalities in multiple organ systems. Analysis of an array of pre-specified outcomes reveals a risk gradient that increased across severity of the acute COVID-19 infection (non-hospitalized, hospitalized, admitted to intensive care).

I have no doubt that India is in a terrible spot with its second wave right now. It’s also a country with a lot of poverty, so the health infrastructure can’t keep up. But when we see crazy tallies like 300,000 confirmed cases—a record anywhere in the world—we have to keep in mind that India’s population is massive. 300,000 cases in India is like 100,000 cases in the US. Bad? Of course. The worst the world has ever seen? Not really. Unconfirmed cases are a lot higher, but this has been true in other places in this pandemic, especially Europe and the Northeastern US during their first wave.

-have had COVID-19

-have had COVID-19 symptoms lasting a ""long"" period of time (arbitrary, but in my head this means longer than 1 or 2 months)

-have gotten a vaccine against COVID-19

-have had side effects from the vaccine that lasted a ""long"" period of time (again, arbitrary, but since most people seem to get over their side effects in less than a week--usually less than 2 days--in my head this means side effects lasting longer than a week or two)

-have had ""severe"" side effects from the vaccine at all (in my head, severe means seizures, blood clots, or other such symptoms that rise above the ""fatigue, sore arm, and fever"" that most people seem to experience)

Here's why I ask:

I myself am already fully vaccinated, but somebody important to me in my life is hesitant about getting it because she has it stuck in their head that we can't possibly know what long term side effects can/will be seen with COVID-19 vaccines.  In her case, somebody she knows personally (a 21 year old male) experienced seizures 1 day after getting the J&amp;J vaccine (the seizures are attributed to the vaccine), so it's not like she's looking ONLY at numbers on a page when she hesitates about side effects of any vaccine.

But, the thing is, we already know that COVID-19 can persist for a prolonged period of time in some patients.  There are people who experience COVID-19 symptoms for *months*--so called ""COVID long haulers"".  Yet she's been living her life this past year under what I would call ""selective"" quarantine (she mostly stays at home 6 days a week, but there seems to be one or two social events a month she goes to that involve people from multiple households and regions), and she really has only had just one close call with COVID-19 exposure.  So, to her, she has been living in this pandemic for a year, and still hasn't even caught COVID-19--let alone had to worry about potential long term impacts of it on her.  If she's dodged it this long, why not continue living like she has been living?  Why introduce a variable that, while it would almost certainly reduce the impact of COVID-19 on her if she still caught it, can't guarantee she won't get it while also isn't studied long enough to know that it won't introduce its own long term issues.

But I think she has her risk avoidance backwards here.  If she's worried about long term side effects, getting the vaccine is still, to me, clearly the best path forward.  *To my knowledge* nobody has had long term side effects from the vaccine (setting aside the couple of recently well publicized J&amp;J clotting issues, which I don't even know if those can be long term), yet also to my knowledge, people HAVE had long term COVID-19 symptoms.  I'm looking to have better numbers to back up this notion that you're far more likely to get COVID-19 AND have long term symptoms of it than you are to get a vaccine and have ANY severe side effects--let alone long lasting side effects from it.",,,1619180335,{},gvk3u4i,False,t3_mwpijo,False,False,t3_mwpijo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mwpijo/daily_discussion_thread_april_23_2021/gvk3u4i/,1619189238,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;A fundamental question of the COVID-19 pandemic has been when it is safe to discontinue isolation precautions in patients who have recovered. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) originally recommended a test-based strategy for discontinuing isolation, requiring 2 consecutive negative reverse-transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests at least 24 hours apart. However, as experience with COVID-19 accumulated, we learned that a small number of individuals continue to shed virus long after infection. Given that it appeared that the virus from these persistently positive individuals was not replication competent and there was minimal risk of transmission after sufficient time passed after symptom onset, the CDC shifted to a symptom-based strategy in July 2020, advising that isolation and precautions can be discontinued 10 days after symptom onset or a patient’s first positive RT-PCR result, unless the patient is immunocompromised or had severe disease.  
&gt;  
&gt;In this issue of *JAMA Internal Medicine*, Mack et al examine the National Basketball Association (NBA) 2020 closed-campus (“bubble”) season to assess whether persistently positive individuals can transmit virus. **Among 3648 individuals undergoing RT-PCR testing in the NBA bubble, there were 36 persistently positive cases (34 men \[94%\]). These persistently positive cases produced 1480 person-days of close-contact activities with no transmission events detected.**  
&gt;  
&gt;In many ways, the NBA bubble season, with a fixed population of players and supportive personnel who participated in daily testing and many who were exposed regularly to high-risk indoor, unmasked, close-contact activities, was an ideal experiment to test the transmissibility of persistently positive individuals. However, this was a group of predominantly young, healthy individuals, and none of the persistently positive individuals in this study required hospitalization. As such, these results should not be generalized to those who are immunocompromised or those with severe COVID-19 infections. Moreover, the person-days of maskless, close contact happened a minimum of 2 weeks after the initial infection given the NBA’s cardiac screening protocol, and many of the initial infections happened longer than 3 weeks before arrival to the bubble. As such, this study is unable to provide insight into the ideal timing for discontinuation of precautions in the general public. These limitations notwithstanding, this real-world experiment is one that is unlikely to be repeated and provides convincing evidence that a symptom-based strategy for discontinuation of precautions is the right approach.",,,1619180136,{},gvk3inh,True,t3_mwtq6i,False,True,t3_mwtq6i,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mwtq6i/covid19_lessons_from_the_national_basketball/gvk3inh/,1619189051,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

If my trip had started a week later, I would’ve canceled it.) I don’t need to be convinced of that. I think the early shutdowns were necessary, and India needs one now.

I just think facts and perspective have totally flown out the window in this conversation. Yes, COVID is an emergency and a public health crisis. Why? Because it can overwhelm hospitals. Once the conversation gets hysterical, people panic, and our leaders make terrible policies like long-running lockdowns. The sky isn’t falling. I’m not trying to convince people that there’s no emergency.

One volunteer of the two-year study said he is getting the booster shot for the safety of his family and those around him. 


Gary Lahens proudly wore a bandage over his shoulder for the third time. He is participating in Pfizer’s booster shot study and says he has always had a desire to help his community.

“I want to help people, that’s why I was a cop before. So it stays with you as part of your blood,” Lahens said. “I feel if it works, it helps us open Hawaii, it helps a lot of people.”

He was among the first to get the two shots as part of the vaccine trials in September 2020. He continues to participate six months later.

“I did the study in the beginning because of my mom and my aunties they are all in their eighties,” Lahens said. “I think it was a good thing for me to do.”

Lahens was tested for COVID-19 as part of his third shot and samples of his blood will also be evaluated.

Pfizer says the study will assess the safety and immunity affects the shot may have against emerging variants.

Dr. Warren Sparks, who has been part of Kauai’s vaccination efforts, said he is curious to examine the findings from the latest studies.

“It’s been predicted that we might have a dramatic boost in antibodies after the third shot and we’re waiting to see on the many hundred fold level,” Dr. Sparks said. “And that might be a good thing, it might reduce the breakthrough cases to a true zero.”   

Lahens will be monitored for side effects for a couple of months.

He said he only got a mild fever when he got his second dose. Lahens does not know if he got the higher or lesser dose of the booster shot at this point of the study.

Lahens said, “I am going to be waiting to see what occurs later tonight, you report it on an app, we report if you have any symptoms, fever, so forth.”

In the study, published Thursday in the journal Nature, researchers looked at medical records of more than 73,000 people across the United States whose coronavirus infections did not require hospitalization. Between one and six months after becoming infected, those patients had a significantly greater risk of death — 60 percent higher — than people who had not been infected with the virus.

The research, based on records of patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs health system, also found that nonhospitalized Covid survivors had a 20 percent greater chance of needing outpatient medical care over those six months than people who had not contracted the coronavirus.

The Covid survivors experienced a vast array of long-term medical problems that they had never had before — not just lung issues from the respiratory effects of the virus, but symptoms that could affect virtually any organ system or part of the body, from neurological to cardiovascular to gastrointestinal. They were also at greater risk of mental health problems, including anxiety and sleep disorders.

“We found it all,” said an author of the study, Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, chief of the research and development service at the VA St. Louis Health Care System.

“What was shocking about this when you put it all together was like ‘Oh my God,’ you see the scale,” he added. “It’s still jarring, honestly.”

What’s more, some of the patients’ post-Covid medical issues — like diabetes, kidney disease and some heart problems — could become chronic conditions that would require treatment for the rest of their lives.

“People have continued respiratory disease, continued headache, this, that and the next thing,” said Dr. Laurie Jacobs, chairwoman of internal medicine at Hackensack University Medical Center, who was not involved in the study. “It’s not gone away. And we don’t yet understand the underlying cause, and it’s become chronic in some cases, disabling in other cases. In some areas, people have gotten better, but it’s very variable.”

The study is believed to be the largest yet to evaluate such a comprehensive array of health conditions. The non-hospitalized Covid survivors in the study tested positive for the virus from March 1, 2020, through November.
Editors’ Picks

Most of the nearly 32 million people who have contracted the coronavirus in the United States have not needed hospitalization, so in some ways the study may be applicable to a wide swath of the population. But the Veterans Health System patients in the study may not be representative in other ways, including that 88 percent of them were male and their median age was 61. Nearly 25 percent were Black, 70 percent were white and nearly 5 percent were other races.

Researchers compared their risk of death and other characteristics with data from nearly 5 million patients in the Veterans system who did not have Covid-19 and were not hospitalized during that time. That group had a median age of 67, was 90 percent male and had a somewhat larger proportion of white patients and a somewhat smaller proportion of Black patients.

Dr. Jacobs said her clinic was seeing the wide range of symptoms in the study. But she said the risk of death among the study’s patients was considerably higher than she would have expected. “I was really shocked by the number,” she said.

Between one and six months after experiencing a relatively mild or moderate infection, 1,672 of the 73,345 patients — about 2.3 percent — died, the study reported. It did not indicate what caused the deaths or anything specific about those patients’ conditions.

This is what the German scientists concluded in their study: (Note that ""ChAdOx1 nCov-19"" is the name for the active part of the vaccine that is designed to elicit spike protein antibodies. “Vaccine” refers to the whole solution - both the “ChAdOx1 nCov-19” AND the solution it is administered in. This solution is known to have varying degrees of adenovirus free DNA (fDNA) fragments floating around due to filtration not being 100% effective.)

""Although we found enhanced reactivity of patient serum with platelets in the presence of ChAdOx1 nCov-19, this is likely to be an in vitro artifact. **It is well known that adenovirus binds to platelets and causes platelet activation.**""

""However, interactions between the vaccine and platelets or between the vaccine and PF4 could play a role in pathogenesis. One possible trigger of these PF4-reactive antibodies could be free DNA in the vaccine. We have previously shown that DNA and RNA form multimolecular complexes with PF4, which bind antibodies from patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and also induce antibodies against PF4–heparin in a murine model."" [Source](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104840)

What this means is that the active part of the vaccine is unlikely to be the culprit, and “free DNA” refers to basically scraps of inactive adenovirus DNA fragments that are in the solution that bypassed the filtering process. DNA fragments that mimic PF4.

This complication, called “autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia” is caused by antibodies that recognize multimolecular complexes that closely resemble platelet factor 4 (PF4), usually from the drug Heparin. But these PF4 complexes can come from viruses as well, with the adenovirus being a well-known culprit. [Adenovirus-induced Thrombocytopenia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17148587/)

It is almost certainly the case that the adenovirus fDNA is the culprit given that “antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein do not cross-react with PF4 or PF4/heparin complexes through molecular mimicry.” [Source](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-404769/v1)

The German scientists claim that “ChAdOx1 nCov-19” is very unlikely to be the cause - that the levels of platelet activation from the spike protein alone elicited levels low enough to be considered an inconsequential reactivity, or in their words, ""in vitro artifact"". They hypothesize that something else in the vaccine is the cause, and point to adenovirus fDNA as a likely culprit. 

Since the only DNA in the Inovio vaccine is a replica of the spike protein, and we already know that antibodies against the spike protein do not react with PF4, there is zero indication that this rare complication would be caused by the Inovio nanoparticle DNA. Not all “free DNA” is made equal - it would have to mimic PF4 to cause the same issue.",,,1619185136,{},gvkcju5,False,t3_mw5tuy,False,True,t1_gvjx05j,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mw5tuy/impurities_in_vaccine_possible_cause_of_problems/gvkcju5/,1619194453,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

More and more evidence is coming out that the new variants are infecting kids more readily now that they're in school, socializing, and doing sports. Domestically and worldwide it's also hitting kids harder. 

Here's a compilation of articles I've seen within the last month:

Again, you don't seem to understand that these are private companies. Pfizer could simply have said no, and that would have been the end of that. As it is, given that Sanofi were working on their own vaccine, it's astonishing that they worked out that deal as early as they did.

WTF are you talking about? What order? That Sanofi thing had nothing to do with their orders. They had ordered much more than they would ever need already last year!

The EU ordered hundreds of millions of doses, way more than they needed, mid last year, from every major viable manufacturer. Just like every other country.

We're probably going to be past the point of people who are willing to work for a vaccine within a few weeks. It's amazing that we got  through most adults before reaching this point. Now the burden has to be on the government to make the vaccine truly effortless to get. Go where the people are. Have employees in every CVS, Walmart, Walgreens, and whatever else all over the country asking every single person they see if they'd like to be vaccinated. Hell put them up in shopping malls or sporting events, why not? Wherever there are massive influxes of people and a capacity to store vaccines, there should be pop up vaccination locations.

Journalists greatly exaggerate the subset of the country that doesn't want to be vaccinated. The statistics on the issue don't legitimize the panic. I cannot emphasize enough how much I think we'll very easily be able to reach herd immunity without forcing anyone to get vaccinated. There are so few people who would outright refuse the vaccine that it really doesn't matter. I feel that the more serious issue now is the subset of the population whose interest in vaccination extends to ""Yeah sure, why not?"" and nothing further.

Where I live my state mask mandate was lifted on august 6th in everywhere except schools or government buildings, and local businesses that required them.  My county for example followed the state's lifting on april 6th, so small businesses are not required to mask any longer.  The only mandates are big box stores, and most of those have a percentage of people not wearing a mask.

anecdotally from my own experience of going to the grocery store and home improvement stores, less than half of the people I see in a store are not wearing a mask, which means more than half are masking, which sort of surprised me.  Not sure how long that will last.  The stores had signs on the doors saying mask and distance, but there wasn't a single employee that I saw enforcing that rule.

my theory is that this will only increase as more get vaccinated and we inch closer to summer time.  my running bet with my friends and family is that by memorial day you will see more people not wearing masks in public than people wearing masks in public.

bars and restaurants around me not requiring masks and servers/bartenders not wearing masks essentially means it is over in my county as far as I can tell.

&gt;In summary, based on the route whereby SARS-CoV-2 infection is acquired and the independence of mucosal and systemic responses, there must be a mucosal immune dimension to COVID-19. Whether it makes a significant contribution to the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or can be exploited to good effect for diagnostic purposes or for therapy and prophylaxis, can only be determined by carrying out appropriate investigations. [**Table 2**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7733922/table/T2/) lists some potentially important studies that should be undertaken to elucidate mucosal immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Children, many of whom have been out of school for over a year, beg for food outside supermarkets and restaurants. Entire families huddle in flimsy encampments on sidewalks, asking for baby formula, crackers, anything.

&gt;A year into the pandemic, millions of Brazilians are going hungry.

&gt;The scenes, which have proliferated in the last months on Brazil’s streets, are stark evidence that President Jair Bolsonaro’s bet that he could protect the country’s economy by resisting public health policies intended to curb the virus has failed.

&gt;From the start of the outbreak, Brazil’s president has been skeptical of the disease’s impact, and scorned the guidance of health experts, arguing that the economic damage wrought by the lockdowns, business closures and mobility restrictions they recommended would be a bigger threat than the pandemic to the country’s weak economy.

&gt;That trade-off led to one of the world’s highest death tolls, but also foundered in its goal — to keep the country afloat.

**MASSACHUSETTS UPDATE**

**CDC** update on first dose shots:

51,122 first dose shots. Last week 55,538. 

7 day rolling avg is now 44,249. 44,879 yesterday. 

3,548,972 MA residents have first doses - 51.49% (3,497,850 - 50.75% yesterday)

64.05% of adults now

At this rate, the first dose shots:

End of

April - 3,858,712

May - 5,230,418

June - 6,557,875

**Eligible population numbers (based on 5,540,726 population)**

End of

April - 69.64%

May - 94.40%

June - 118.36%

70% on 5/1 (- 4 days)

80% on 5/13 (- 7 days)

90% on 5/26 (- 11 days)

**Total population numbers (based on 6,892,503 population)**

End of

April - 55.98%

May - 75.89%

June - 95.15%

60% on 5/7 (- 6 days)

70% on 5/22 (- 9 days)

80% on 6/7 (- 14 days)

**Fully vaccinated estimates**

Using the date for 90% of adults with dose 1, if all of them get a second dose 31 days later (1 month for Moderna), plus an additional 14 days for immunity to kick in, that will put us at a date of: Sunday, July 11th (- 11 days), for 90% of adults fully vaccinated.

Reasons as to why blame for CoronaVirus 2nd wave is completely on Modi Government


1.  They didn't allow foreign vaccines. Said we're self sufficient with Indian. Didn't allow private firms to manufacture COVIDSHIELD or COVAXIN. 


2.  Following above they didn't increase manufacturing capabilities. SII was under contractual obligation ; they had to send 100 million vaccines but only were able to send 18 million. Following which UK filed a lawsuit against them. For imported vaccines took praise on themselves. 


3. Age cap blunder by allowing only 45+ citizens to get vaccinated. Indian Boomer population will bang thalis rather than getting a vaccine. The disinformation campaigns have been huge.


4. They didn't increase oxygen production since last year. 


5. Having paid media works wonders in dissing the ground reality but when actuality spreads like fire in form of cremations, whom will you blame then? 



6. Just imagine the first stock deal of vaccines India did was in Jan 21; while other nations did it back in May 20.

We'll see where the numbers hit this week, but the US is more like 55-60% first jab, 40% fully vaccinated in the 16+ age group.  They've handed out over 220M doses.  It's rising by about 5% per week, was a bit slower earlier, and now a bit faster because once you start doing the second doses, first jabs necessarily slow down and then you pick up the pace after you swallowed that initial wave of first jabs.

The EU waited until Phase II data for nearly all the vaccines before ordering, but by then most other countries had already bought up the initial production slots back in June/July.  So in November they started going on a buying spree that culminated in a lot of contracts signed Nov/Dec/Jan.  Those deals are now starting to come to fruition, which is great!  But they realized they had screwed up in October, and went on a buying spree to try and make up for the mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

The EU did get a kinda bad luck of the draw.  They bet on AZ, GSK/Sanofi, early and only one of those produced.  But GSK and Sanofi for whatever reason aren't getting sued despite their vaccine never even making it to the approval stage.

&amp;#x200B;

But January is late -- they had some of the first dibs on the Pfizer vaccine in June, but then balked.  They could have had another 100+ million vaccines delivered by now if they took the deal.  When they went back to the negotiation table in November they were only able to secure small amounts due to Pfizer having no excess capacity, so then they had to go and work a deal with Sanofi, which took until January.  Yes, impressive.  But less impressive than if they had just taken the deal originally given to them in June.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that at this point we're mainly agreeing -- I'm just saying EU's decision to wait for Phase II data on many vaccines before committing funds was as damning as AZ's failures to deliver.  I focus most of the the blame on the EU for not spreading the risk around, and you're focusing most of your blame on AZ.  There's enough to go around, but I just at the time in June/July didn't understand the EU's reluctance to make some deals and spend some cash.  

My family that lives in Europe in July booked trips to the US to visit in early winter because they knew that there was a decent  chance that they'd need to go get the vaccine (and they did when they hopped over).  So if EU citizens were looking at it in July saying ""eh, this seems a bit risky"" and making contingency plans, the big diplomats should have seen it also.",,,1619198603,{},gvl73ht,False,t3_mvz6yr,False,True,t1_gvl4sw7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mvz6yr/eu_preparing_legal_case_against_astrazeneca_over/gvl73ht/,1619212167,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
