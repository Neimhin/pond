I know that too many choices can lead to unhappiness, yes. But you're attributing that to more traveling is overly simplistic at best and outright wrong at worst.

Here's some studies showing personal benefits of traveling:

[Purchasing spent on having (experiences) leads to more happiness than purchasing on having (material goods)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614546556)

[Daily variability in physical locations is linked to positive affect](https://www.hartleylab.org/uploads/5/3/1/0/53101939/heller%E2%80%8A_et_al._2020.pdf)

[In this study, women who traveled twice a year were less prone to depression than women that traveled less frequently](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7548396_Vacations_improve_mental_health_among_rural_women_the_Wisconsin_Rural_Women's_Health_Study)

There's also a lot of research that shows that traveling increases cognitive capacities and makes a person more open-minded to new ideas and different groups of people. Traveling has a LOT of mental benefits.

I'm also unable to find any evidence that states that more experiences causes you to be less happy. I know that an overwhelming amount of choices can make you less happy, but the research I was able to find on the topic of experiences points towards more experiences making you happier, more so than material objects as well.",,,1605691745,{},gcpd7ho,False,t3_jw3sna,False,True,t1_gcpbfwh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jw3sna/bill_gates_says_more_than_50_of_business_travel/gcpd7ho/,1605744967,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Does nicotine exposure (NOT through smoking) reduce the severity of COVID-19?

Researchers from the University of Bristol, Oxford Brookes University and the University of California San Diego neatly demonstrated how the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exhibits high affinity for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), with significant implications for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pathology and infectivity. Their findings are published on the bioRxiv* preprint server.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, remains a substantial threat to global health, the international economy and society as a whole. Several major risk factors for COVID-19 have been identified – namely, age, diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.

Recently, given the seemingly low prevalence of smokers among hospitalized patients, it was suggested that nicotine might provide some protection in mitigating COVID-19, which was dubbed the 'protection' hypothesis.

More specifically, based on the early observations where smoking prevalence in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was lower than expected, certain studies suggested a role for nAChRs in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 through a direct interaction between these receptors and the viral spike glycoprotein (S-protein).

This suggestion was primarily based on the fact that the S-protein from SARS-CoV-2 harbors a sequence motif related to known nAChR antagonists and may interact with nAChRs. Consequently, such interactions may be then involved in pathology and infectivity, which is a notion known as 'nicotinic hypothesis.'

Furthermore, it was also proposed that COVID-19 might be controlled or alleviated by the use of nicotine if this compound can sterically or allosterically compete with the virus for binding to nAChRs.

In this novel study, the researchers used molecular simulation to examine the nicotinic hypothesis – primarily by appraising whether the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein can stably bind to nAChRs via the Y674-R685 region (i.e., a viral portion with the highest affinity to these receptors).",,,1605674399,{},gcotkv7,False,t3_jvtbgt,False,True,t3_jvtbgt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvtbgt/daily_discussion_post_november_17_questions/gcotkv7/,1605733245,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There's not a single country that's all capitalist or all socialist, there are all a combination of the two.

I think in an ideal situation you're essentially using one to balance out the other. Too much capitalism and you have endless corruption and wealth consolidation and too much socialism and you wind up with like state-owned media and likely way too much power in the hands of the government with no sufficient checks.

Weather capitalism or socialism is better depends entirely one the type of business you're running.

You'll see socialism Excel in situations where you're servicing a region. like with a power plant or a hospital you can't really just build more power plants and hospitals for the sake of price competition alone. there has to be a a need for the hospital or power plant to justify it being built and in that case capitalism tends to suck because if there's no competition then capitalism's just a big pile of crap and when the overhead to create a business is really high or the profit margins are low people don't rush to provide consumers options.

In the same sense trying to apply capitalism to firefighters or police just didn't work worth a damn. Capitalism for public school also wouldn't really work.

So really you have to take your time to think about the application of the service or the product being made and if capitalism applies in a way where you're actually going to have competition and consumer choice or you're just going to create monopolies.

If you're just going to create monopolies then you're better off with socialism, If competition would create too much redundancy like having competing fire departments, you're better off with socialism.

If you need strict government control like with the military, you're better off with socialism and in all those cases in any realistic application you're also still using capitalism. Like even though fire departments are socialized by taxpayers all their equipment is still made in the private sector. And that right there is an example of how socialism and capitalism constantly work together in the real world.

If you watch too much TV news you might not understand that, but Even my Republican professor taught us that in political science. All countries exist on the spectrum you can just imagine capitalism on one side of the spectrum and socialism on the other and everybody falls somewhere in the middle of those two extremes.

There's no such thing as an all-capitalist country or and all socialist country.

Most importantly there's no reason to favor one over the other as a generalized position. Each has its own proper application where it will excel and each has its own application where it will produce inferior results, like privately and fire departments. We tried that and what happens is when your neighbor doesn't pay their fire department bill their house burns down and then your house burns down too and then the whole block burns down because you can't just let houses burn down when they're next to each other.",,,1605678481,{},gcoz55q,False,t3_jvtn2t,False,False,t1_gcm2v0g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvtn2t/belgium_alysson_a_24yearold_barber_told_us_about/gcoz55q/,1605736598,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Both are Federal countries. Both feature a constitution that makes healthcare primarily the responsibility of the individual states rather than the Federal government.

The US, well, the numbers speak for themselves.

Public health guidelines and restrictions don’t work if they are just done as ad hoc local regulations. Like, how can they? A county or a state can lock down as much as it likes, but it won’t do shit if infected people can just drive in from 30 mins up the road, or people under lockdown can just drive to a place with fewer or no restrictions. Things need to be consistent nationally to have an effect, and need to be combined with mandatory quarantine on anyone coming into the country (otherwise you just have the same problem at a larger, global level).

States in Australia put in restrictions appropriate for their level of infection. But critically, the Federal government ensured the response was coherent on a national level, enforced quarantine at the national border, and also provided the financial support so that people under lockdown would still get paid and/or not lose their job. In America everyone got a one time check equivalent to a mere two weeks of the Australian coronavirus payments and that’s it.

Powell has repeatedly stated that stimulus spending is preferable to rate cuts because the government has the power to target specific at risk groups (e.g. workers in service industries, unemployed workers, low income families). In contrast, cutting rates is less ideal because it tends to create asset bubbles and increase income inequality.

You can have your opinions, but facts are facts!

&gt;""...Early lockdowns work like in 1918...""
This is the 21st century and we have daily travel of billions of people! Get real! It spread into every single population in less than a year!

1) an ""early lockdown"" for the USA would've been around late September early October, which is when SARS-CoV2 was shown to spread out of china to italy.


By December, it's estimated we had somewhere in the range of /~1000 cases on the West coast of the US. Both ends of the country had undetected uncontrolled community spread.


In my opinion, it's plausible that people in-the-know were aware of the outbreak by late October. Especially people with connections in China. 


Well, Trump was hashing out a trade agreement with Xi right around this time. So Rump is probably feeling like he can totally trust his new buddies who're telling him they got this all under control when word starts breaking in December of mysterious deaths in wuhan and voices of whistleblowers cannot be suppressed...


I'm not going to bother from there because by January there is no ""early shutdowns"" to stop spread. It is going to burn through the worldwide population and enforcement of mitigation is measured on the personal level mostly.


 You poison the well by making it a political issue. And your opinion on the US leadership is of zero consequence except that it adds to the civil unrest here, so I would wish that moderators in this subreddit would take that into consideration.

The most horrifying part of my trip was when i was in fresh produce and one of the managers walked about 3 feet in front of my cart facing off to my left and pulled her mask all the way down right in front of me to yell some instructions to an employee in the bakery 25-30 ft from us. She then continued to talk loudly as she walked up to the counter of the bakery to continue this discussion. That led to instant anxiety  as yelling/shouting is a very efficient way of spreading the virus. 

This is not the first violation of company policy i have seen from this manager. She did the same thing  near me 3 months ago. And she walked by a non social distancing group of young employees who were pulling stock all off the same pallet and gave two instructions to help her do something else. She wasn't wearing her mask at all when she talked to them. It was hanging around her neck. 

I remember her because she reminds me of me someone i use to know but she is quite loud and prefers to shout across the store to employees even though she always walks up to them anyway. 

I reported the store today to corporate. I live in a wealthy conservative town and 98% of the customers properly wear a mask in the store. The employees can too but the management seems very lax in policy enforcement.",,,1605670101,{},gcomrcd,False,t3_jw72z0,False,False,t1_gcokp7k,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jw72z0/nearly_half_of_83_people_who_attended_ohio/gcomrcd/,1605728792,36,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It was halfway through March in Dutchess County NY, cases were skyrocketing, and it was obvious the direction this was going.

My fucking supervisor wouldn’t even answer her phone because she knew I wanted us to have a meeting about it. They ignored me for over a week.

We never had a meeting, our facility was shut down by the state on March 20th and we never even fucking prepared our clients in the slightest, because our staff was convinced that nothing was wrong.

It didn’t get any better from there. When I tried to go up the chain of command to report the carelessness of our staff I was met with a bunch of bureaucratic idiots who were ALSO continuously downplaying the seriousness of the virus. I decided to quit rather than try to work through a healthcare crisis with a bunch of healthcare “professionals” who were too afraid to even *discuss* what was happening so that we could adequately prepare to help our clients.

**REPRODUCTION RATE IS CRUCIAL**

Central to the public health calculations on this concept for COVID-19 is the reproduction rate, or R value, of the virus that causes it. Assuming complete vaccine efficacy, herd immunity percentage thresholds for infectious diseases are calculated by dividing 1 by the R value, deducting the result from 1, and multiplying by 100. For instance, herd immunity from highly contagious measles, with an estimated R value of 12 or higher, will kick in only if 92% or more within a group are immune. Additionally, anything less than 100% vaccine efficacy - such as the 90% or so suggested in early data on the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 shots - would require a matching rise in percentage of coverage to reach herd threshold.

Amesh Adalja, a scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said a good target for immunity in the United States would be for more than 70% of the population to be inoculated, but added that the figure could go up if vaccines are less effective.

**FOCUS ON PROTECTING THE VULNERABLE?**

Edinburgh’s Riley said this suggests that for now, pursuing an idea of herd immunity through COVID-19 vaccination is fruitless.

A better approach, she said, could be to ""turn herd immunity on its head"", and use the first limited supplies of vaccines to protect those most in need, without worrying about the more robust members of the ""herd"" who can live relatively happily with the virus.

The North American Aerospace Defense Command has announced that NORAD will track Santa on Dec. 24, just as it has done for 65 years. But there will be some changes: Not every child will be able to get through to a volunteer at [NORAD’s call center](https://apnews.com/article/d3430560b3df428590c9e9ed11c67f16) to check on Santa’s whereabouts, as they have in years before.

Normally, 150-160 volunteers crowd into a conference room at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, taking two-hour shifts to answer the phones as eager children call to see if Santa and his sleigh have reached their rooftops. All together, 1,500 people over 20 hours have participated in the call center in the past, fielding more than 130,000 phone calls, beginning at 6 a.m. Eastern time on Christmas Eve.

This year, due to safety restrictions forced by [the COVID-19 pandemic](https://apnews.com/hub/virus-outbreak), the number of volunteers has been drastically cut to what NORAD expects will be fewer than 10 people per shift.

Our small Texas town is at a 30% positivity rate and the virus is rampant here.  If we need to cancel holidays we need to close bars, indoor dining, take school to remote, and mandate mask.  If you can ticket me for not wearing a seatbelt you can ticket me for not wearing a mask.  We need to get real or prepare for the death of our friends, family, and loved ones.

Society isn't always about your personal freedoms. That's what makes a society a society instead of individuals doing what they think is best. The problem with a disease that spreads this quickly and the common flu are what dictates our decision. If it weren't filling up hospital beds and killing the elderly so easily it would be different.

It's not just about spitting on them though. If you risk going out more often than for necessities you come into contact with tens of people who do the same.

Going about your daily business is exactly why the pandemic is speeding up instead of slowing down. If there is a 2% that you could kill someone because you wanted coffee and a god damned dinner a a restaurant, that's on you. 

There is absolutely no reason that we couldn't keep most businesses open whole doing only online ordering and no cash. Only using drive through. Going about our daily lives in a more safe manner. I've been in retail for over a decade. I can still go to my job and limit exposure. That's not the same thing as ""continuing on with my daily lives because I won't die"". 

Countries, towns, cities have been able to shut down and Benn better for it. I'm sorry. Your ""freedom"" is just an excuse to say you aren't willing to take the blame if someone dies because you wanted a fucking latte. Touch your mailbox, touch a door handle,


Everyone HAS to leave their houses at some point or order food. Why can't you accept that limiting that is better than not? Why do you think you are smarter than scientists and doctors urging people to be better?

I hate to attack you, but it's online and I'm not really angry, just confused. I'll have a conversation without downvoting you. I just don't understand. Out government has the right to mandate what's best for society as a whole. It's not killing people to wear masks, but it might save lives. It can't force you to never leave your house, but it can limit how you do it. Why? Because it might save lives. Limiting your freedom will not kill you. 


It's the same with any law. You have a right to bear arms, but there is a limit. Noone needs assault rifles to hunt or protect their house.

No, it's that the people that die are 79-80+ years old and have an average life expectancy of 1-2 months even without covid. 

In reality the only thing we've done that actually works to reduce deaths is extra precautions for older people and nursing homes. That's what caused the most deaths and the biggest spikes in the early days, most notably NYC. 

The US has more people over 65 years of age than most countries have people. 

&gt;Just look at Trump's Coronavirus Task Force telling the people of Michigan to 'rise up' against COVID-19 restrictions. 

Why wouldn't people want their livelihoods destroyed? 

They should surrender and accept being ruined, right? 


&gt;It's double tragic because experience from e.g. 1918 shows that hard early lockdowns ultimately benefit the economy more.

Lock downs are what you do to prisoners 

Quarantines are for sick people. 

Either way it only delays the spread, it doesn't stop it, despite those clickbait headlines of a country or area ""beating covid""

This happens all the time, and it's part of your natural biological systems. Anytime you randomly feel achy, feverish, and tired, there's a decent chance you're feeling your body react to some viral infection you never noticed. 

That makes exposing something to it very low-risk: there's already safeguards ""designed"" into the system to keep it from doing something dangerous.


Drugs... there's a lot of different kinds of drugs, but in general they introduce some new chemical to your body that's designed to bind to some other chemical or directly to your cells.

Because humans are very very complicated biological machines, it's hard to predict what will happen as a result. Unlike your immune system, these chemicals are not an evolved part of your biology.

You don't have the necessary knowledge and expertise to claim that. The public health experts are the ones who determine that using science and evidence.

2) ""I genuinely can’t fathom anyone who thinks they are a good idea. They bring tons of collateral damage that I actually find worse than the virus itself for most people""

Funny how in Taiwan, Thailand, New Zealand and Vietnam, that ""collateral damage"" didn't happen. Instead, they have much better lives there compared to most places in the world since they didn't need to lock down too long. They have no lockdown, plus no virus to worry about.

3) ""the fact is it is not a virus you’d consider to be exceptionally deadly.""

More than 250,000 dead in the US and counting, and you think it isn't deadly? Wow.

4) ""I am totally in favor of shielding the vulnerable (who wish to be shielded - many probably do not want to be isolated away from others) and letting everyone get back to life.""

No, that is a stupid plan. Even if you shield the vulnerable, letting the virus spread among everyone else with no restrictions will lead to thousands getting sick and dying.

5) ""There is an infrastructure in place for people who wish to avoid all contact - curbside pickup, takeout, cashless transactions, apps for everything, etc.""

This actually supports my arguments. Since those options are available, people shouldn't be going out much or congregating in indoor places.

6) ""this elimination strategy in our particular circumstances makes no sense.""

Yeah, why should the US eliminate a highly contagious virus that has sickened 11 million people and killed more than 250,000? It makes no sense at all!

7) ""There is no uniform response because we are a federalist system""

Irrelevant. If the President was a sensible person, he/she would have a coordinated national response that is customized to each state's needs. They can tailor each state's guidelines and not simply do a one-size-fits-all approach. In fact, that is what Biden claims he is planning to do.

Restrictions of some form are going to exist for a while even after the threat is totally gone. No one will know if it's restrictions or the vaccine keeping things together, and we'll have to ease our way out of this. There will be varying concerns at every level.

**February:** Healthcare workers and about 10 million vulnerable people are vaccinated. There's still the risk of COVID for the unvaccinated vulnerable population. We keep isolating.

**April:** About 30-40 million vaccinated, but many still waiting on a second dose or waiting for the vaccine to become effective after that second dose. Cases are still high. There is uncertainty about how much the vaccine prevents spread vs. mitigates severe disease. We keep isolating.

**June:** 100 million vaccinated, but any adverse events are national news. There are a lot of people holding out on the vaccine and some vulnerable people who can't get the vaccine for safety reasons. Cases are still high but falling due to vaccination and summer. Restrictions are lifted somewhat, but no one knows how much is safe. Republican states resume normalcy quicker than Democratic states. Democratic states cite thousands more dying in Republican states. Republican states say the deaths are worth the economic gains/return to normalcy.

**August:** Pretty much back to normal, but things like concerts and packed bars are only trickling back, depending on state/country. Some governments will be calling for masks to remain a part of daily life until cases drop to negligible levels. There's concern about vaccine compliance, longevity of protection, and the upcoming winter. Return to normalcy becomes a choice you make, not a definitive reality. You either feel guilty moving on with life, knowing the problem is only 75% solved, or you keep isolating and watch the majority of the world move on.

**2021 and beyond:** Every year there are concerns over vaccine compliance, rising cases, possible vaccine-evading mutations, etc... It becomes a normal thing for there to be occupancy limits or mask requirements at certain times of year. Media outlets hype up every emerging infectious disease, keeping you anxious and constantly worried about COVID 2.0.

If you're hoping to wake up to a headline saying, ""We're back to normal!"" then you're going to be disappointed. If you're waiting for your own vaccination, you'll be waiting until mid-summer if you're healthy and then months after that for it to be fully effective. If you're waiting for vulnerable to be vaccinated, who the ""vulnerable"" are and whether or not they've been vaccinated will be nebulous.

Explain why virtually every non-authoritarian country (and I somewhat hesitate to even include AU on that list, given some of the insane shit that happened in Victoria), that didn't have the deck stacked massively in their favor, has failed to eradicate the virus in spite of lockdowns.

&gt;certainly not ""exponentially greater costs"". You get an increased chance of it surviving an extra generation or two, but it's all a similar amount of proportional effort.

I don't think you understand what ""proportional effort"" means.

&gt;The only reason you won't is (a) willpower, and (b) you won't close the borders to countries with it endemic to keep it out. Instead, you'll stay in pandemic purgatory until vaccines have been heavily rolled out.

If by ""willpower"" you mean ""willingness to send millions of people to the unemployment line and possibly to homeless shelters because we've trashed the economy,"" then yes, that is a pretty significant obstacle. But good luck explaining that perspective to academics with cushy tenured jobs.

&gt;Reminder, Wuhan was once the epicentre, with a case count we will never know. Think they made the wrong call in striving for containment?

I think containment is a waste of time and extremely counterproductive once community transmission gains a certain amount of momentum. Keeping hospitals from becoming overloaded is the only rationale for doing this that even warrants consideration. Aiming for complete eradication, though, is lunacy.

Of course the US is different from New Zealand and Taiwan. But that's no excuse for having no coordinated national public health plan. That is the main reason why the US is out of control, NOT because it has more people. Also, it's funny how you ignored Thailand and Vietnam, which are population-dense and share borders with other countries, giving them a disadvantage. Yet they still successfully contained the virus.

2) ""New Zealand I spent a day driving six hours and maybe saw three cars lol. It has very few people.""

New Zealand has urban areas with lots of people too. Just because you drove in an area with less people doesn't mean that there are no densely populated areas. Those are at higher risk of having outbreaks. If you'd like to go to that angle, then realize that the US has rural areas that have few people too, yet these areas are also getting ravaged by covid.

3) ""I don’t want to be under house arrest when I haven’t committed a crime.""

There's a difference between wanting a lockdown and understanding that it needs to be done. I don't want a lockdown, however, I recognize that it is the necessary first step in containing the outbreak. If the virus is out of control, moving around needlessly without precautions endangers other people, so yes, it becomes a crime under such circumstances.

 **COVID-19: Full utilization of certified and recognized intensive care bed capacities**

  Basel, November 17, 2020 

 The 876 intensive care beds certified and recognized by the SGI, which are normally available in Switzerland for the treatment of adults, are currently practically fully occupied. An overload of these ordinary bed capacities has been prevented, on the one hand, because non-urgent interventions and treatments have been postponed in many places. On the other hand, an increase in bed capacity due to the already excessively high demand for intensive care teams has contributed to the fact that the intensive care units are not currently overloaded across Switzerland.  

**Prevent loss of quality in intensive care treatment**

  The Swiss intensive care units are at the limit of their proper bed capacity, but are doing their utmost to cope with this increased influx of critically ill patients compared to the first COVID-19 wave and to be able to care for all critically ill patients in the future. However, it is of the utmost importance to contain the COVID-19 pandemic now and postpone non-urgent interventions and treatments across Switzerland in order to prevent a loss of quality in intensive care treatment. The SGI is in close contact with the intensive care units, national authorities and various health care organizations in order to coordinate and implement measures based on previous knowledge and experience. 

 **National transfers as a burden for patients and relatives**  

In the past few days, several critically ill patients have been transferred to other cantons or even language regions due to a lack of intensive care resources. These relocations from their own residential area are a great burden for the affected patients and their relatives. However, national transfers are necessary in order to enable all critically ill patients in Switzerland to receive the best possible intensive care treatment. The SGI would like to thank the intensive care units, hospitals and cantons for their solidarity and the patients and relatives for their understanding. \[...\]",,,1605659401,{},gco3uqy,True,t3_jw51ai,False,False,t1_gco3axn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jw51ai/switzerland_icu_beds_maxed_out_876876/gco3uqy/,1605717468,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The instituted a mask mandate that was actually enforced with fines. They closed borders so Victorians couldn't spread the infection elsewhere. They instituted a robust contact tracing program to track the virus progression. And now they have had no cases of local infection for over a week in a city of millions.

It may be that the US is too far gone for this stuff to be effective, but the idea that it can't be done is just false.  We have conservative governments in place in a lot of places too, but unlike the US conservative doesn't mean that science is the enemy.

There will be some casualties in the small business space for sure, but that would be true regardless of the government response because our citizens tend to listen to science too and were avoiding restaurants and cinemas even before they were told to. That was shown in Sweden when they shut nothing down and still felt a fairly significant economic impact because individual people still stayed in.

You're also ignoring a bunch of other factors of letting the virus run rampant. The mortality rate will jump when all your hospitals hit 100% capacity, which is coming any week now.

 **COVID-19: Vollständige Auslastung zertifizierter und anerkannter Intensivbettenkapazitäten** 

Basel, 17. November 2020

 Die 876 von der SGI zertifizierten und anerkannten Intensivbetten, die in der Schweiz normalerweise zur Behandlung Erwachsener zur Verfügung stehen, sind aktuell praktisch vollständig belegt. Eine Überlastung dieser ordentlichen Bettenkapazitäten konnte bisher zum einen vor allem deshalb verhindert werden, weil vielerorts nicht dringende Eingriffe und Behandlungen verschoben wurden. Zum anderen hat eine Erhöhung der Bettenkapazitäten durch die ohnehin bereits übermässig stark geforderten Teams der Intensivstationen dazu beigetragen, dass die Intensivstationen aktuell nicht schweizweit überlastet sind.

 **Qualitätseinbussen in der intensivmedizinischen Behandlung verhindern** 

Die schweizerischen Intensivstationen sind an der Grenze ihrer ordentlichen Bettenkapazitäten, tun aber ihr Möglichstes, um diesen im Vergleich zur ersten COVID-19- Welle erhöhten Zustrom an kritisch kranken Patientinnen und Patienten zu bewältigen und auch künftig alle kritisch kranken Patientinnen und Patienten versorgen zu können. Es ist jedoch von allergrösster Wichtigkeit, die COVID-19-Pandemie jetzt einzudämmen und nicht dringende Eingriffe und Behandlungen schweizweit zu verschieben, um Qualitätseinbussen in der intensivmedizinischen Behandlung zu verhindern. Die SGI steht in engem Austausch mit den Intensivstationen, nationalen Behörden sowie diversen Organisationen des Gesundheitswesens, um auf Grundlage bisheriger Erkenntnisse und Erfahrungen Massnahmen zu koordinieren und umzusetzen. 

**Nationale Verlegungen als Belastung für Patientinnen, Patienten und Angehörige** 

In den vergangenen Tagen wurden mehrere kritisch kranke Patientinnen und Patienten aufgrund mangelnder intensivmedizinischer Ressourcen in andere Kantone oder sogar Sprachregionen verlegt. Diese Verlegungen aus der eigenen Wohnregion sind für die betroffenen Patientinnen und Patienten und für ihre Angehörigen eine grosse Belastung.

And in an ideal world, that'd be fine. Because the Republican President, majority-Senate, governors, state legislatures, state Supreme Courts, and mayors would listen to one of the most qualified scientists on the planet and follow his fucking advice. But they aren't, and there's nothing he can do about it.

As to why, well, take your pick. My personal theory is that Trump either genuinely (cuz he's a dumbass) or falsely (because he thought it'd hurt his chances of reelection) downplayed COVID early on, and once it was clear he was wrong, he was just completely incapable of admitting that. And since the president said that, it *must* be true, so the entire GOP apparatus (Fox News, GOP politicians, etc.) all echoed him.

That's early days, though. Why did and do they continue to downplay the virus (well, until January 20th, at which point the GOP will become very concerned with why the Dems are failing to contain it)? It's probably a mix of not wanting to alienate Trump's base (I mean, look at the election: Fox News is disagreeing with the fraud claims and everybody is calling them traitors), being dumbasses, not wanting to look wishy-washy, or to preserve the economy (stay-at-home orders=bad for business).

Tbf these are all symptoms of where we are with capitalism. I.e. I sure as fuck aint paying them shit.....i love free streaming when it applies to media i want...hell i pirate at least 75% of the games i own...i am also an asshole and not helping the things i like when i cant even be measured as a demographic for em let alone money.

 Then again they could throw some ads in or even some micro$ and i wont cry because it wont affect me. I personally will always default to FREE AND ILL DO THE LEG WORK over YOU DO THE THINKING AND ILL THROW U A FEW...because thats my life exp etc. Some folks wont miss a 5 fee or whatever and could stop reading and still not even remember they pay it...others will miss those 3 bottles of pepsi etc. Seems like more people want their 2 40ozs is the point and i agree and dont blame them is all i was saying. 

If anyone thinks they can revive classic media with the promise of ( you'll pay more but itll be better especially this time ) is foolish..that ship has sailed...dont you think they did or have done every god damned thing they could already? It failed and thats why they have a paywall its the only soldier left fighting.

The way forward is to stop giving clicks/attention to things you think dont deserve it.
Mfers link articles to say they are bad..the whole time funneling money so that whatever org will do the same thing again. The way to fix this issue may be alot of places but i doubt its backwards to things like paying for a magazine or something. If half of these news places had any talent of personality they could do this same shit in video or even possibly print but they would have to work like all the rest of us to get to that level (less so off name value) and could use a system similar to patreon if they want 5 a month. 

As a matter of fact check out places on youtube like china uncensored. This is what news in 2020 should be but bigger on the bigger scales obviously. No its not a billion dollar industry it never was supposed to be. Then again nothing was supposed to pull record profits every year like most of this big shit does. 

Give good news = people will pay you
Force people to pay without any proof or really any god damned thing b4 buying = people say this why do they charge shit and then not pay you too

Its really simple folks.

""The findings, however, should not be used to conclude that a recommendation for everyone to wear masks in the community would not be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, because the trial did not test the role of masks in source control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.""

Essentially, they are saying don't do what lots of people are already doing. This study deals specifically with protecting the mask wearer. The question of masks reducing the ability for an infected person to spread the virus is not in dispute. 

So look at it like this...

You are one of 10 people in a room. One of the other 9 has Coronavirus. If you wear a mask but none of the other 9 do, this study suggests you will get minimal protection. If the person with Coronavirus wears a mask, everyone else will get some protection. The problem is that in most cases, you won't know who has Coronavirus. So you can't designate only that person to wear a mask. Thus, the only way to protect anyone in the room is for everyone to wear a mask. 

There are other issues with the study methodology. 

Specifically, I am referring to two things:

- low adherence to mask-wearing guidance among participants
- self-reporting of results, with minimal verification
- absence of clinical control group or clinical setting

These issues don't necessarily invalidate the results. But they do mean that these results should not be taken as conclusive.

Regional hospitals that fail to retain surgical volume eventually become fiscally insolvent and either close or sell themselves to a larger network. This has been an ongoing process for at least the last two decades in medicine. 

To imply that patients were being mechanically ventilated for financial reasons in New York is ignorant and dangerous. At the time, people were being intubated early due to reports from other countries indicating the rapid progression of severe hypoxia, as well as due to concern over viral aerosolization from less invasive modalities of oxygen delivery including high flow nasal cannula and CPAP/Bipap, both of which can significantly improve the delivered O2 concentration vs simple nasal cannula or even a non-rebreather. We have since learned how harmful mechanical ventilation can be for these patients, and most practices have now gone the other way in trying to minimize invasive positive pressure ventilation.

I’m a software developer, when we ship projects slowly and carefully, with time to do extended closed and open betas, tonnes of testing/QA, etc., we have a lot less bugs/issues when we do eventually ship the project to everyone.  But when we’re under a huge time crunch, we have way shorter betas, less testing/QA, and despite our best efforts ship with more bugs/issues.  I think this is a reasonably generalizable phenomenon to almost any project - more rushed is less safe, all else being equal.

With that being said, vaccines are extremely safe in general, and we’ve produced LOTS of them in the past.  This isn’t something massively different than what has been produced in the past, only slightly different - this lowers risks/unknowns a lot.  So even though it’s an exceptionally short time between the start of phase 1 trials and widespread vaccination, with little time for long term side effects to show up ... there likely won’t be any significant ones.

Basically, I do think this vaccine will be a bit riskier than one developed and tested over a 15 year period, hard to see how it wouldn’t be.

&gt; J&amp;J’s vaccine uses a common cold virus known as adenovirus type 26 to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells in the body and trigger the body’s immune system.

&gt;J&amp;J's candidate is a single-dose vaccine, whereas the vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer and another under development by AstraZeneca AZN.L all require two shots separated by several weeks.

Getting the mRNA Vaccine into the cell without prompting immune response was one of the main challenges in getting the whole thing working.  That said, the mechanism is to have the mRNA vaccine get in cells, then to produce a protein in the cell with the spike and have it then be able to leave the cell.  From there it prompts the immune response.  

The 'spike' protein should never incorporate itself into the cell barrier.  Think of it as a lock &amp; key -- normally virus spike has a key and the cell wall has lock receptor that opens to allow virus to enter and infect a cell.  First, they wouldn't design a protein that becomes embedded in a cell for this type of application.  Second, if they did it would presumably occur at the outset and would appear early on in clinical trials.  Neither the mRNA or the protein it creates should persist in the body, there is no change to the DNA in any of this.  mRNA isn't a particularly stable molecule and [typically lasts from several minutes to days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA#Degradation) unlike DNA which is much more robust and has all sorts of repair mechanisms to make it last the lifetime of a cell.  Likewise, proteins don't last indefinitely and once the mRNA is not working more are not created.

And that is also the answer to your second question.  mRNA is typically not self replicating (although i believe can be engineered to do so, but that is not something that occurs accidentally).  A Virus is self replicating because it implants itself in the nucleus of a cell and either has a type of viral RNA that is then used to make mRNA to direct the cell to make more virus copies, or implants itself in the DNA of the cell (a retrovirus, e.g., HIV) to make mRNA. My understanding that there is work on 'self-amplifying' mRNA vaccines that are dependent on a type of DNA (plasmid DNA), but that is not what these vaccines are.

Will Finland have to go into a complete lockdown again?” https://www.ft.com/content/a2b4c18c-a5e8-4edc-8047-ade4a82a548d

This is a thing I find so strange about Tegnell - He doesn’t simply say “we believe herd immunity will give Sweden some protection” and stop right there.

A lot of (sociopathic) parents aren't testing their sick children because they don't want to have to quarantine, and don't want the school shut down. The worst of the lot aren't even keeping them home, or are sending them even if they know they are infected.

There is so little testing of children, unless an adult in the house tests positive (especially those who aren't symptomatic), I believe it absolutely skews the numbers.

Everyone knows that bacterial and viral infections spread like wildfire though schools: colds, flu, conjunctivitis, parasites, STIs (in older students), etc. I don't get how any rational person thinks COVID will be any different.

Students are infecting each other, students are infecting teachers, students are infecting their parents, teachers are infecting partners/housemates and their own children--and vice-versa on every account.

Over 1 million have been diagnosed, and many have viral loads equal to adult infected people even if they have less symptoms (and like adults, some develop severe to lethal complications, but most don't.)

SNAP!

I said, ""We ain't going there to murder you or dad with a bug you can't see when we exhale, nor do I want to bury you like what's her name's kids did (family friend had a birthday party in the late Spring with family and friends... and someone brought COVID-19).

Yes its true its completely possible there is some bizarre side effect, but it is very unlikely because researchers would have hypothesised these potential side effects if there were any. These papers are under a huge amount of scrutiny.

There isnt going to be some hidden biological mechanism that is gonna pose a serious risk to anyone not already identified, mRNA vaccines in particular are very good at this because they only produce particles required for an immune response a full virus is never formed.

There is a sort of cult around mask use that is frightening to watch, and if people aren’t free to point this out without getting attacked on subreddits like this, then we have a real problem going forward. 

The truth is that the science says something different about the general public wearing masks than people here want to admit. And it gets really dangerous when every medical and scientific association in the world knew this at  the beginning of the year and of course have always advised against mask use for the general public because of what the science says.

I've been unable to find any actual examples of this happening with a _vaccine_ since we started proper clinical trials back in the 60's and 70's (prior to that it's hard to even find good documentation, it was the wild west of medicine). Post-release monitoring for side effects has been in place that whole time. That makes it kind of impossible to give ""odds"" of there being long-term side effects, but if it does happen it will be a world first in something like 500+ different cleared vaccines.

There was one case you'll hear referenced a lot; a european H1N1 flu vaccine + adjuvant (chemical to make it more effective) in 2009. That caused a slight increase in side effects including a 0.03% chance of causing narcolepsy. BUT the vaccine was used without the adjuvant elsewhere and had no unusual side effects. The follow-up studies pin the increased side effects on that additional chemical rather than the vaccine itself.

It's also happened a few times with non-vaccine medications like thalidomide.

My wife is a critical care / ICU nurse that thankfully moved to a work at home nurse case management job. We know a large number of nurses that have already quit, more that are planning on quitting very soon. Most due to concerns for family member's health, some due to the working conditions and mental/physical fatigue.   

Which brings us to the next issue. You should see my wife's email box. The number of emails she gets from nurse staffing agencies offering truly insane pay (as in 8-10k a week + meals and lodging) for contract ICU nursing positions is staggering. Hospitals are critically short staffed, and a large number of those nurses that are remaining on the job, are leaving full time salaried positions and pursuing these highly lucrative contract jobs; many leaving as an employee on a Friday and walking back into the same ICU as a contractor on Monday at 8-10x the pay. I don't blame them at all, but many most healthcare systems (especially smaller / rural) cannot afford to pay every nurse on staff 30-40k a month. 

Some people think it will get better when healthcare workers are vaccinated, but it won't. Something that few people are talking about is how these vaccines work. They do not ***prevent*** a person from contracting COVID-19, they simply give a person's body a rapid immune response to the virus; meaning most people will be asymptomatic and/or have a very minor symptoms; and the infection will resolve much faster. 

This is a key point: Just as a person can be infected, be 100% asymptomatic and spread the virus to others (even during the 7-10 day incubation period), A vaccinated person can and will still spread COVID-19 to non-vaccinated persons. simply vaccinating all healthcare workers does **NOT** eliminate the risk to that healthcare worker's families.",,,1605717455,{},gcqdqad,False,t3_jwbngf,False,False,t1_gcpbwrh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jwbngf/anger_in_north_dakota_after_governor_asks/gcqdqad/,1605765408,27,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Less than half our meals were eaten indoors and we didnt eat anywhere that didnt feel safe. There were a few shops that we skipped because of lax policies.

The DANMASK-19 trial randomized participants to follow those public health measures with or without an additional recommendation to wear a surgical mask when outside the home. Mask use outside of hospitals was uncommon in Denmark at the time. After 1 month of follow-up, 1.8% of participants in the mask group and 2.1% in the control group developed infection. While the evidence excludes a large personal protective effect of mask wearing, it weakly supports lesser degrees of protection, and cannot definitively exclude no effect. The findings are published in Annals of Internal Medicine.

Researchers from Copenhagen University Hospital recruited 6,024 adults who spent at least 3 hours per day outside their homes, whose occupations did not require masks, and who did not have a previous known diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants were randomized into the mask group or the control group and those in the mask group were given a supply of surgical masks. All participants completed weekly surveys and antibody tests with PCR testing if COVID-19 symptoms developed, and at 1 month. **At the conclusion of the trial, infection rates were similar between the two groups.**

Of note, Danish authorities did not recommend masks during the study period and their use in the community was uncommon. Public transportation and shops remained open and recommended public health measures included quarantine of persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection, social distancing, limiting the number of people seen, frequent hand hygiene and cleaning, and limited visitors to hospitals and nursing homes.

According to the study authors, their findings offer evidence about the degree of protection mask wearers can anticipate in a setting where others are not wearing masks and where other public health measures, including social distancing, are in effect. The findings, however, should not be used to conclude that a recommendation for everyone to wear masks in the community would not be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, because the trial did not test the role of masks in source control (transmission from an infected person to others) of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The editors of Annals of Internal Medicine chose to publish the DANMASK-19 trial because it is a well-designed study that provides an important piece of evidence to understand the puzzle of how to control the COVID-19 pandemic. They also note that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recently updated their guidance to acknowledge that masks, when worn by all, may reduce transmission by both source control and personal protection. They say that the DANMASK-19 trial does not conflict with these guidelines, but shows that any contribution to risk reduction through personal protection is likely to be less than through source control.",,,1605715534,{},gcq9px4,True,t3_jwifke,False,True,t3_jwifke,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jwifke/denmark_trial_measures_effectiveness_of_adding_a/gcq9px4/,1605763259,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,Pessimist2020,,,[],,,,text,t2_6clhmtcw,False,True,[],"An Italian study supporting the case that the novel coronavirus was circulating outside China earlier than thought has sparked doubts among some Western scientists who called for further tests. A paper published by the Italian Cancer Institute describes the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in blood taken from healthy patients in Italy in October last year during a lung cancer screening trial. If the data are correct, they would change the history of the pandemic and raise questions of when and where the virus emerged. This would normally be a high-risk group for COVID-19, so it is puzzling why all patients were asymptomatic.

The World Health Organization has said the new coronavirus and COVID-19, the respiratory disease it causes, were unknown before the Wuhan outbreak was reported. But it has said the possibility that the virus may have “silently circulated elsewhere” cannot be ruled out. There have been at least 55,573,000 reported infections and 1,336,000 reported deaths caused by COVID-19 globally since the virus was first detected in China.

**UNEXPECTED DETECTION**

China believes the Italian study shows that tracing the origin of the virus is an ongoing process that may involve many countries. “China will continue working with the rest of the international community to contribute to the global cooperation on fighting COVID-19 and other viruses,”, Zhao Lijian, spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, told reporters in Beijing on Tuesday. Italy’s first COVID-19 patient was detected on Feb. A further SARS-CoV-2 antibodies test was carried out by the University of Siena for the same research paper, called “Unexpected detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the pre-pandemic period in Italy”.

It showed that in six cases, the antibodies were able to kill SARS-CoV-2.

**SERIOUS ISSUE INDEED**

Both Italian scientists said the antibody test was in-house designed and never validated by other researchers in a peer review. What was also noticeable was the very high seroprevalence in the research study’s population, they said, referring to the percentage of people who may have been exposed to the virus. Most of the scientists’ scepticism focuses on the so called specificity of the antibody tests, that, if not perfect, might reveal the presence of antibodies to other diseases. “Other recent reports have shown that seasonal coronaviruses can elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies,” said Jonathan Stoye, group leader at the Francis Crick Institute.

“I think we need a really conclusive demonstration that those samples are picking up the COVID-19 virus and that those antibodies were not actually triggered by another virus,” Andrew Preston, reader in microbial pathogenesis at the University of Bath, told Reuters. Where they had gone, if they had contact with China,” Giovanni Apolone told Reuters, calling for colleagues globally to “open their databases and conduct retrospective researches”.",,,1605706513,{},gcpt607,True,t3_jwfulb,False,True,t3_jwfulb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jwfulb/italian_study_suggesting_covid_predates_china/gcpt607/,1605754073,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Back in April, Trump imagined the pandemic’s quick end: “Maybe this goes away with heat and light,” he said. From the start, he and others wondered if hot, humid weather might curb the spread of COVID-19, as it does other coronavirus diseases. Many experts countered that seasonal effects wouldn’t stop the new virus, which was already spreading in the tropics. But, fueled by shaky science and speculative stories, people widely latched on to seasonality as a possible savior, before the virus proved that it could thrive in the Arizona, Texas, and Florida summer.  

This brand of magical thinking, in which some factor naturally defuses the pandemic, has become a convenient excuse for inaction. Recently, some commentators have argued that the pandemic will imminently fizzle out for two reasons. First, 20 to 50 percent of people have defensive T-cells that recognize the new coronavirus, because they were previously exposed to its milder, common-cold-causing cousins. Second, some modeling studies claim that herd immunity—whereby the virus struggles to find new hosts, because enough people are immune—could kick in when just 20 percent of the population has been infected.

Neither claim is implausible, but neither should be grounds for complacency. No one yet knows if the “cross-reactive” T-cells actually protect against COVID-19, and even if they do, they’re unlikely to stop people from getting infected. Herd immunity, meanwhile, is not a perfect barrier. Even if the low thresholds are correct, a fast-growing and uncontrolled outbreak will still shoot past them. Pursuing this strategy will mean that, in the winter, many parts of the U.S. may suffer what New York City endured in the spring: thousands of deaths and an untold number of lingering disabilities. That alone should be an argument against …

7.	The Complacency of Inexperience

When illness is averted and lives are spared, “nothing happens and all you have is the miracle of a normal, healthy day,” says Howard Koh, a public-health professor at Harvard. “People take that for granted.” Public-health departments are chronically underfunded because the suffering they prevent is invisible. Pandemic preparations are deprioritized in the peaceful years between outbreaks. Even now, many people who have been spared the ravages of COVID-19 argue that the disease wasn’t a big deal, or associate their woes with preventive measures. But the problem is still the disease those measures prevented: The economy is still hurting, mental-health problems are growing, and educational futures have been curtailed, not because of some fearmongering overreaction, but because an uncontrolled pandemic is still afoot.

If anything, the U.S. did not react swiftly or strongly enough. Nations that had previously dealt with emerging viral epidemics, including several in East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, were quick to take the new coronavirus seriously. By contrast, America’s lack of similar firsthand experience, combined with its sense of exceptionalism, might have contributed to its initial sloppiness. “One of my colleagues went to Rwanda in February, and as soon as he hit the airport, they asked about symptoms, checked his temperature, and took his phone number,” says Abraar Karan, an internist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. “In the U.S., I flew in July, and walked out of the airport, no questions asked.”

Even when the virus began spreading within the U.S., places that weren’t initially pummeled seemed to forget that viruses spread. “In April, I was seeing COVID patients in the ER every day,” Karan says. “In Texas, I had friends saying, ‘No one believes it here because we have no cases.’ In L.A., fellow physicians said, ‘Are you sure this is worse than the flu? We’re not seeing anything.’” Three months later, Texas and California saw COVID-19 all too closely. The tendency to ignore threats until they directly affect us has consigned the U.S. to …

8.	A Reactive Rut

In March, Mike Ryan at the World Health Organization advised, “Be fast, have no regrets … The virus will always get you if you don’t move quickly.” The U.S. failed to heed that warning, and has repeatedly found itself several steps behind the coronavirus. That’s partly because exponential growth is counterintuitive, so “we don’t understand that things look fine until right before they’re very not fine,” says Beth Redbird, a sociologist at Northwestern. It’s also because the coronavirus spreads quickly but is slow to reveal itself: It can take a month for infections to lead to symptoms, for symptoms to warrant tests and hospitalizations, and for enough sick people to produce a noticeable spike. Pandemic data are like the light of distant stars, recording past events instead of present ones. This lag separates actions from their consequences by enough time to break our intuition for cause and effect. Policy makers end up acting only when it’s too late. Predictable surges get falsely cast as unexpected surprises.

This reactive rut also precludes long-term planning. In April, Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, told me that “people haven’t understood that [the pandemic] isn’t about the next couple of weeks [but] about the next two years.” Leaders should have taken the long view then. “We should have been thinking about what it would take to ensure schools open in the fall, and prevent the long-term harms of lost children’s development,” Redbird says. Instead, we started working our way through a serial monogamy of solutions, and, like spiraling army ants, marched forward with no sense of the future beyond the next few footsteps.

These errors crop up in all disasters. But the COVID-19 pandemic has special qualities that have exacerbated them. The virus moved quickly enough to upend the status quo in a few months, deepening the allure of the hastily abandoned past. It also moved slowly enough to sweep the U.S. in a patchwork fashion, allowing as-yet-untouched communities to drop their guard. The pandemic grew huge in scope, entangling every aspect of society, and maxing out our capacity to deal with complexity. “People struggle to make rational decisions when they cannot see all the cogs,” says Njoki Mwarumba, an emergency-management professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Full of fear and anxiety, people furiously searched for more information, but because the virus is so new, they instead spiraled into more confusion and uncertainty. And tragically, all of this happened during the presidency of Donald Trump.

Trump embodied and amplified America’s intuition death spiral. Instead of rolling out a detailed, coordinated plan to control the pandemic, he ricocheted from one overhyped cure-all to another, while relying on theatrics such as travel bans. He ignored inequities and systemic failures in favor of blaming China, the WHO, governors, Anthony Fauci, and Barack Obama. He widened the false dichotomy between lockdowns and reopening by regularly tweeting in favor of the latter. He and his allies appealed to magical thinking and steered the U.S. straight into the normality trap by frequently lying that the virus would go away, that the pandemic was ending, that new waves weren’t happening, and that rising case numbers were solely due to increased testing. They have started talking about COVID-19 in the past tense as cases surge in the Midwest.

“It’s like mass gaslighting,” says Martha Lincoln, a medical anthropologist at San Francisco State University. “We were put in a situation where better solutions were closed off but a lot of people had that fact sneak up on them. In the absence of a robust federal response, we’re all left washing our hands and hoping for the best, which makes us more susceptible to magical thinking and individual-level fixes.” And if those fixes never come, “I think people are going to harden into a fatalistic sense that we have to accept whatever the risks are to continue with our everyday lives.”",,,1605708365,{},gcpw3ns,True,t3_jwg7v0,False,True,t1_gcpvs2k,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jwg7v0/america_is_trapped_in_a_pandemic_spiral/gcpw3ns/,1605755727,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

A city could close higher-risk venues like bars and nightclubs while opening lower-risk ones like retail stores. There’s a “whole control panel of dials” on offer, but “it’s hard to have that conversation when people think of a light switch,” says Lindsay Wiley, a professor of public-health law at American University. “The term lockdown has done a lot of damage.” It exacerbated the false binary between shutting down and opening up, while offering …

3.	The Comfort of Theatricality

Stay-at-home orders saved lives by curtailing COVID-19’s spread, and by giving hospitals some breathing room. But the orders were also meant to buy time for the nation to ramp up its public-health defenses. Instead, the White House treated months of physical distancing as a pandemic-ending strategy in itself. “We squandered that time in terms of scaling up testing and contact tracing, enacting policies to protect workers who get infected on the job, getting protective equipment to people in food-processing plants, finding places for people to isolate, offering paid sick leave … We still don’t have those things,” says Julia Marcus, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School and regular Atlantic contributor. The country is now facing the fall with many of the same problems that plagued it through the summer.

Showiness is often mistaken for effectiveness. The coronavirus mostly spreads through air rather than contaminated surfaces, but many businesses are nonetheless trying to scrub and bleach their way toward reopening. My colleague Derek Thompson calls this hygiene theater—dramatic moves that appear to offer safety without actually doing so. The same charge applies to temperature checks, which can’t detect the many COVID-19 patients who don’t have a fever. It also applies to the porous and inefficient travel bans that Trump and his allies still tout as policy successes. These tactics might do some good—let’s not conflate imperfect with useless—but they cause harm when they substitute for stronger measures. Theatricality breeds complacency. And by emphasizing solutions that can be easily seen, it exacerbated the American preference for ...

4.	Personal Blame Over Systemic Fixes

SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly among America’s overstuffed prisons and understaffed nursing homes, in communities served by overstretched hospitals and underfunded public-health departments, and among Black, Latino, and Indigenous Americans who had been geographically and financially disconnected from health care by decades of racist policies. Without paid sick leave or a living wage, “essential workers” who earn a low, hourly income could not afford to quarantine themselves when they fell ill—and especially not if that would jeopardize the jobs to which their health care is tied. “The things I do to stay safe, they don’t have that as an option,” says Whitney Robinson, a social epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

But tattered social safety nets are less visible than crowded bars. Pushing for universal health care is harder than shaming an unmasked stranger. Fixing systemic problems is more difficult than spewing moralism, and Americans gravitated toward the latter. News outlets illustrated pandemic articles with (often distorted) photos of beaches, even though open-air spaces offer low-risk ways for people to enjoy themselves. Marcus attributes this tendency to America’s puritanical roots, which conflate pleasure with irresponsibility, and which prize shame over support. “The shaming gets codified into bad policy,” she says. Chicago fenced off a beach, and Honolulu closed beaches, parks, and hiking trails, while leaving riskier indoor businesses open.

Moralistic thinking jeopardizes health in two ways. First, people often oppose measures that reduce an individual’s risk—seat belts, condoms, HPV vaccines—because such protections might promote risky behavior. During the pandemic, some experts used such reasoning to question the value of masks, while the University of Michigan’s president argued that testing students widely would offer a “false sense of security.” These paternalistic false-assurance arguments are almost always false themselves. “There’s very little evidence for overcompensation to the point where safety measures do harm,” Bergstrom says.

Second, misplaced moralism can provide cover for bad policies. Many colleges started their semester with in-person teaching and inadequate testing, and are predictably dealing with large outbreaks. UNC Chapel Hill lasted just six days before reverting to remote classes. Administrators have chastised students for behaving irresponsibly, while taking no responsibility for setting them up to fail—a pattern that will likely continue through the fall as college clusters inevitably grow. “If you put 10,000 [students] in a small space, eating, sleeping, and socializing together, there’ll be an explosion of cases,” Robinson says. “I don’t know what [colleges] were expecting.” Perhaps they fell prey to …

5.	The Normality Trap

In times of uncertainty and upheaval, “people crave a return to familiar, predictable rhythms,” says Monica Schoch-Spana, a medical anthropologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. That pull is especially strong now because the pandemic’s toll is largely invisible. There’s nothing as dramatic as ruined buildings or lapping floodwater to hint that the world has changed. In some circles, returning to normal has been valorized as an act of defiance. That’s a reasonable stance when resisting terrorists, who seek to stoke fear, but a dangerous one when fighting a virus, which doesn’t care.

The powerful desire to re-create an old world can obscure the trade-offs necessary for surviving the new one. Keeping high-risk indoor businesses open, for example, helps the virus spread within a community, which makes reopening schools harder. “If schools are a priority, you have to put them ahead of something. What is that something?” says Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard. “In an ideal world, they would be the last to close and the first to open, but in many communities, casinos, bars, and tattoo parlors opened before them.” A world with COVID-19 is fundamentally different from one without it, and the former simply cannot include all the trappings of the latter. Cherished summer rituals like camps and baseball games have already been lost; back-to-school traditions and Thanksgiving now hang in the balance. Change is hard to accept, which predisposes people to …",,,1605708169,{},gcpvs2k,True,t3_jwg7v0,False,True,t1_gcpvkud,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jwg7v0/america_is_trapped_in_a_pandemic_spiral/gcpvs2k/,1605755547,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Army ants will sometimes walk in circles until they die. The workers navigate by smelling the pheromone trails of workers in front of them, while laying down pheromones for others to follow. If these trails accidentally loop back on themselves, the ants are trapped. They become a thick, swirling vortex of bodies that resembles a hurricane as viewed from space. They march endlessly until they’re felled by exhaustion or dehydration. The ants can sense no picture bigger than what’s immediately ahead. They have no coordinating force to guide them to safety. They are imprisoned by a wall of their own instincts. This phenomenon is called the death spiral. I can think of no better metaphor for the United States of America’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The U.S. enters the ninth month of the pandemic with more than 6.3 million confirmed cases and more than 189,000 confirmed deaths. The toll has been enormous because the country presented the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus with a smorgasbord of vulnerabilities to exploit. But the toll continues to be enormous—every day, the case count rises by around 40,000 and the death toll by around 800—because the country has consistently thought about the pandemic in the same unproductive ways.

Many Americans trusted intuition to help guide them through this disaster. They grabbed onto whatever solution was most prominent in the moment, and bounced from one (often false) hope to the next. They saw the actions that individual people were taking, and blamed and shamed their neighbors. They lapsed into magical thinking, and believed that the world would return to normal within months. Following these impulses was simpler than navigating a web of solutions, staring down broken systems, and accepting that the pandemic would rage for at least a year.

These conceptual errors were not egregious lies or conspiracy theories, but they were still dangerous. They manifested again and again, distorting the debate around whether to stay at home, wear masks, or open colleges. They prevented citizens from grasping the scope of the crisis and pushed leaders toward bad policies. And instead of overriding misleading intuitions with calm and considered communication, those leaders intensified them. The country is now trapped in an intuition nightmare: Like the spiraling ants, Americans are walled in by their own unhelpful instincts, which lead them round and round in self-destructive circles.

“The grand challenge now is, how can we adjust our thinking to match the problem before us?” says Lori Peek, a sociologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder who studies disasters. Here, then, are nine errors of intuition that still hamstring the U.S. pandemic response, and a glimpse at the future if they continue unchecked. The time to break free is now. Our pandemic summer is nearly over. Now come fall, the season of preparation, and winter, the season of survival. The U.S. must reset its mindset to accomplish both. Ant death spirals break only when enough workers accidentally blunder away, creating trails that lead the spiraling workers to safety. But humans don’t have to rely on luck; unlike ants, we have a capacity for introspection.

The spiral begins when people forget that controlling the pandemic means doing many things at once. The virus can spread before symptoms appear, and does so most easily through five P’s: people in prolonged, poorly ventilated, protection-free proximity. To stop that spread, this country could use measures that other nations did, to great effect: close nonessential businesses and spaces that allow crowds to congregate indoors; improve ventilation; encourage mask use; test widely to identify contagious people; trace their contacts; help them isolate themselves; and provide a social safety net so that people can protect others without sacrificing their livelihood. None of these other nations did everything, but all did enough things right—and did them simultaneously. By contrast, the U.S. engaged in …

1.	A Serial Monogamy of Solutions

Stay-at-home orders dominated March. Masks were fiercely debated in April. Contact tracing took its turn in May. Ventilation is having its moment now. “It’s like we only have attention for only one thing at a time,” says Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida.

As often happens, people sought easy technological fixes for complex societal problems. For months, President Donald Trump touted hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 cure, even as rigorous studies showed that it isn’t one. In August, he switched his attention to convalescent plasma—the liquid fraction of a COVID-19 survivor’s blood that might contain virus-blocking antibodies. There’s still no clear evidence that this century-old approach can treat COVID-19 either, despite grossly misstated claims from FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn (for which he later apologized). More generally, drugs might save some of the very sickest patients, as dexamethasone does, or shorten a hospital stay, as remdesivir does, but they are unlikely to offer outright cures. “It’s so reassuring to think that a magic-bullet treatment is out there and if we just wait, it’ll come and things will be normal,” Dean says.

Other strategies have merit, but are wrongly dismissed for being imperfect. In July, Carl Bergstrom, an epidemiologist and a sociologist of science at the University of Washington, argued that colleges cannot reopen safely without testing all students upon entry. “The gotcha question I’ve handled most from reporters since is: This school did entry testing, so why did they get an outbreak?” he says. It’s because such testing is necessary for a safe reopening, but not sufficient. “If you do it and screw everything else up, you’ll still have a big outbreak,” Bergstrom adds.

This brief attention span is understandable. Adherents of the scientific method are trained to isolate and change one variable at a time. Academics are walled off into different disciplines that rarely connect. Journalists constantly look for new stories, shifting attention to the next great idea. These factors prime the public to view solutions in isolation, which means imperfections become conflated with uselessness. For example, many critics of masks argued that they provide only partial protection against the virus, that they often don’t fit well, or that people wear them incorrectly. But some protection is clearly better than no protection. As Dylan Morris of Princeton writes, “X won’t stop COVID on its own is not an argument against doing X.” Instead, it’s an argument for doing X along with other measures. Seat belts won’t prevent all fatal car crashes, but cars also come with airbags and crumple zones. “When we layer things, we give ourselves more wiggle room,” Dean says.

Several experts I’ve talked with have been asked: What now? The question assumes that the pandemic lingers because the U.S. simply hasn’t found the right solution yet. In fact, it lingers because the familiar solutions were never fully implemented. Despite claims from the White House, the U.S. is still not testing enough people. It still doesn’t have enough contact tracers. “We have the playbook, but I think there’s a confusion about what we’ve actually tried and what we’ve just talked about doing,” Dean says. A successful response “is never going to be one thing done perfectly. It’ll be a lot of different things done well enough.” That resilience disappears if we create…

2.	False Dichotomies

A world of black and white is easier to handle than one awash with grays. But false dichotomies are dangerous. From the start, COVID-19 has been portrayed as a disease that mostly causes mild symptoms in people who quickly recover, and occasionally causes severe illness that leads to hospitalization and death. This two-sided caricature—severe or mild, sick or recovered—has erased the thousands of “long-haulers” who have endured months of debilitating symptoms at home with neither recognition nor care.

Meanwhile, as businesses closed and stay-at-home orders rolled out, “we presumed a trade-off between saving lives and saving the economy,” says Danielle Allen, a political scientist at Harvard. “That was foolishness of the most profound degree.” The two goals were actually aligned: Epidemiologists and economists largely agree that the economy cannot rebound while the pandemic is still raging. By treating the two as opposites, state leaders rushed to reopen, leading a barely contained virus to surge anew.",,,1605708042,{},gcpvkud,True,t3_jwg7v0,False,True,t3_jwg7v0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jwg7v0/america_is_trapped_in_a_pandemic_spiral/gcpvkud/,1605755432,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Honest question... The democrat I understand, but race and gender. When people take certain stances and it seems to be in alignment with their specific race or their gender (like 85% of that race/gender agrees), but they come out and say it has nothing to do with race or gender. Does race and gender really have something to do with it?

I'm not white. But a lot of non-white people have this shared feeling that certain groups of white people behave a certain way because they feel they are different from us.

**Sources**

For starters, given the current environment I try to avoid misinformation by sticking to three primary sets of sources:

* official FDA/CDC/EMA releases
* medical journals ([Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is great for this and my go-to source)
* legal documents and court reports

They're the sorts of documents that are hard to fake provenance of, and have lots of copies in independent locations. Make sure they include sources, and if a statement seems fishy check that it has a source—indicated by a superscript number like this^(1)—and that the source says what they claim.

If you can't find one of those sources to back something up, just make sure your source is something hard to fake. Track it down, make sure its source is reputable and that what you've heard matches what they say.

Also news sources are a great *starting point* but they tend to be scientifically illiterate and prone to sensationalism. For example, that H1N1 vaccine I mentioned is oft described as having ""very high"" incidences of mortality. That's a quote from the paper, but in context ""very high"" means 0.0040% vs. 0.0015%. Rather than trust what they say, use the terms and authors as starting points for your own search in Google Scholar.

**Citations and Authors**

Next, check citations and authors. How often has the paper been cited? If it was a good paper with reliable information, you should see it cited dozens of times in a source like Google Scholar, even if it's only a year or two old. It's also worth a cursory glance at the citations: are they refuting the paper, or referencing it?

Last, check the authors. On a scientific paper, you generally want to be looking at **First and Last author**. The first author is the postgrad or researcher who lead the study. The last author is the advisor who oversaw the study and signed off on it. Make sure the last author in particular has a long, relevant career and no reason for bias.

&gt;Important info from the press release...

On a side note, these tweets made sense when Pfizer released their last press release claiming 90% efficacy, the points still stand...

&gt;Don't be quick to trust Big Pharma here. **Releasing preliminary and incomplete clinical trial data by press release is terrible science.**

&gt;Until this vaccine candidate receives independent review, we should temper our expectations.

https://twitter.com/Public_Citizen/status/1325807368811110403


&gt;I don’t know if Pfizer’s preliminary claim of 90% efficacy is accurate, but I do know that:

&gt;1. they have every incentive to hype their vax as much as possible in press release

&gt;2. **it’s extremely fucked that consequential public health messaging is coming thru a corporate filter**

&gt;that early data not verified by independent bodies is coming straight to the public via corporate press release - about a massively consequential therapeutic with the potential to transform our lives! - is in itself a shameful indictment of the for-profit pharmaceutical industry

&gt;...and the fact that several people are angrily calling me an anti-vaxxer for noting that wildly successful preliminary results aren’t 100% certain yet is a shameful indictment of twitter 

&gt;vaccines are good! these results are promising! they’re also preliminary! all true!

A free market might be good at efficiently allocating hospital resources 80% of the time, but if the remaining 20% cause a serious risk to human health any efficiency gains are simply not worth it.  And such examples apply all across our world.

Summary: as of yesterday afternoon, all 876 ICU beds in Switzerland have been filled with COVID-19 patients as each and every non-essential treatment or procedure has been cancelled and, compared to March, additional beds have been certified to be ICU beds. Intensive Care nurses and doctors are doing their best to stay ahead of the constant influx of new severe cases but the last resort is to move patients across Switzerland as beds are freed.

Contaminations and manufacturing errors happen and have tragic consequences.

They happen with drugs of all types, and also non-drugs like lettuce and cars.

They are increasingly rare, and have nothing to do with trial timelines or how safe the actual medicines are.

For those reasons, I don't feel like I left anything relevant out of my initial comment, but I did edit it so people can do their own fact-checking anyways.

Difference in this situation is that my grandparents ARE 100% cognitive and educated on the situation, and have made their own decision.

Workplaces dont want to be forced to let people work from home, or find replacement workers for essential jobs if asymptomatic cases are known.

This is compared to 69252 people aged 85 years and over, 59760 people aged 75-84, and 49363 people aged 65-74. Cumulatively, the percentage of covid deaths from ages 0-14 is (81/223984) is 0.036%.

Concerning IFR, the IFR for children aged 10 is estimated at 0.002% for children aged 10 according to a [recent study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160895v7.full.pdf). This is compared to around 15% at age 85. So yes, covid doesn't only affect the elderly, but it is overwhelmingly skewed towards them (15% for age 85 is much higher than even at age 55 (0.4%)).

The extremely low chances that a young person can be affected by that is not enough to ruin lives and potentially childhood development as well. This is a disease that only poses a reasonable risk to the elderly yet we want to shut down society for possibly a full year and maybe more with no regard for the vast majority of society. Mental health doesn't matter, quality education doesn't matter, social and life development of children doesn't matter, meeting financial needs doesn't matter, as long as everything is pushed to the side to give the elderly a few more years to live.",,,1605664883,{},gcodn3p,False,t3_jvs09j,False,True,t1_gco7sir,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvs09j/study_shows_mass_residents_relaxing_on_social/gcodn3p/,1605723565,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Yes, not a theory.

There exists immune cross-reactivity between human coronaviruses.

This is a terrible article to explain anything of what is likely happening.

Likely these prepubescent children got some lactoferrin immunostimulatory induced coronavirus immunity passed on from breast-feeding. But the article and study don't indicate that they asked this and I couldn't even determine the parent and child blood types.

This only can occur if the mother had been previously exposed to some form of coronavirus after puberty. The children will carry immunity to all types of coronavirus until about puberty.

&gt;negative real rates under Greenspan

The problem with that is that there weren't persistent negative real short-term rates under most of Greenspan's tenure. [Even the effective federal funds rate only dips below inflation for a period during the early-2000s recession](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1ED0).

&gt;CAUSED the housing bubble.

You could posit that his monetary policy was too loose but monetary policy is a blunt instrument and has to be used considering it's effect on the economy overall not on just one aspect. Also, to put it down to being *the* or even *mostly the* cause of the housing bubble isn't really accurate. You have like housing policies, financial market regulation, systemic underestimation of risk (+some possible moral hazard) in the financial sector and even capital inflows pushing down on long-term interest rates.

&gt;Wealth inequality also exploded over this timeframe which isn't a coincidence. Chart US wealth inequality with QE policies...direct correlation. 

[Here's the chart in percentage terms.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/#quarter:123;series:Net%20worth;demographic:networth;population:1,3,5,7;units:shares;range:1989.3,2020.2) It's a longer-running trend than just quantitative easing (which began in 2008). Wealth inequality is something to keep in mind but I'd say that focusing on post-tax-and-transfers income inequality is a better thing to be concerned about in terms of the standard of living people actually enjoy.

&gt;Rate go down = unemployment

Simply untrue. Lower interest rates increase the incentive to consume relative to saving and decreases the cost of investment. This stimulates the economy and decreases unemployment.

&gt;stagflation

Hmmm, rather interesting that in the past 8 years or so prior to the COVID-crisis, that the US maintained a [relatively stable low rate of inflation](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi) and a [positive, if relatively sluggish until the past few years, rate of economic growth](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth-annual). This came with [falling unemployment](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/unemployment-rate) and [wage growth](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/wage-growth).

If you find any that don't meet your standards, make sure to record them and ask your doctor. The vaccine bottle will include the manufacturer, designation, and batch numbers.

It may be that you have limited choices at first, so you'll have to evaluate the relative risks if it comes up.

My own reason for not worrying about it is that even these cases we're taking about had _extremely rare_ side effects. That AS03 caused something like 0.04% of people to have side effects that wouldn't have without it. That's enough to withdraw it and use a safer version, but way less dangerous than coronavirus.

That's the only kind of thing that slips through the modern system. I'm okay with that tiny chance of something bad happening if it means avoiding the scary symptoms of COVID and getting back to life a few years earlier.

No, she probably lives a joke of a 1st world country where the wage has not kept up with the cost of living. Where there is no family leave and daycare is going to take up the majority of her paycheck. That is the reality for a lot of people in America. Also, unlike in civilized countries like Germany, there are no protections for pregnant women or new mothers in America. I know plenty of women that were fired on maternity leave or while they were pregnant. For the longest time, women didn't even have the RIGHT to pump breastmilk for their babies at work. In some workplaces, they still don't. I worked at a place that told a new mother she could ""pump in the bathroom."" 

America is not a good place to raise a family because of policies like this.

Maybe our politicians, yes, but not any random rich person off the street. Among the first people to get vaccinated would be the healthcare staff including those in hospitals, nursing homes, and clinics. Not forgetting the elderly (probably those who are above 60?) and maybe school going kids. I'm guessing the last to get vaccinated would be the average adult who are either not working or those who can work from home.

After them might be other essential staff like teachers and maybe our foreign construction workers (especially after the dormitory cluster debacle).

It would be quite difficult for a non-priority rich person to buy their way in. With such limited stock, the vaccine program would definitely be headed by our Ministry of Health and only done in government healthcare institutions first. Stock will be checked several times a day (two persons to counter check) and the lot/batch number of each dose will be matched against our National ID number and recorded in the National Electronic Health Record. The person who administers the dose will also be indicated in this NEHR and then issue a vaccine certificate. We'll probably get a notification of some sort (SMS/email/letter) when you are eligible for the shot as well.

So if a billionaire wants to sneak a shot, they would first have to find a person working in our hospitals to steal a dose. And this person would then have to find a way to sneak that stolen dose out of the hospital. And after all that, it still wouldn't be any use because there would be no official record that the person had actually taken the shot and will still be unable to do whatever they want like travel.",,,1605687643,{},gcp9bx0,False,t3_jvw6fr,False,True,t1_gcmuqq5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvw6fr/who_should_be_first_to_get_access_to_a_covid19/gcp9bx0/,1605742699,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I live in the Seattle area. Around the end of February, I went on a trip for a few days.

While I was away, the first big US outbreak happened at a nursing home in the suburbs. When I got back, toilet paper, cleaning supplies, and food were flying off of grocery store shelves. Parents were pulling their children out of school and major employers were starting to have people work from home; government stay-at-home orders came a week or two later. The military came and set up a field hospital at our local football stadium. News about what was going to stay open or not got bleaker every day. At one point I was starting to wonder if supply chains of food and gas were going to break down.

Thankfully, the field hospital didn't see any patients. The death rate wasn't as bad as we'd assumed (based on what was happening in Italy), stay-at-home orders did what they were supposed to do, and the hospitals didn't overflow. (Let's see if it stays that way now!)

I didn't even think about the proteins persisting in the body by embedding themselves in the cells, but yes that may be a concern by some so great that you explained it so well.

My concern was mainly that the immune system would somehow recognize those cells that produced the spike proteins, (which then lead to the immune system creating the anitbodies), as ""somehow corrupt"".

Again that may be totally naive of me, but since the immune system attacks other cells that ""turn bad"", like cancer cells for example, I was thinking it might remember that these cells that produced the spike protein are ""corrupted cells"".

Maybe that's exactly what happens, and it's perfectly fine since we have so many cells anyway and new ones are produced every day? 

As you said though there really seems to be so little information on any of this stuff, other than the surface stuff we get from MSM. 

I really hope Pfizer and Moderna have a great ""marketing team"" that will produce not just the surface information, but also answer more in-depth questions, because it will really improve the confidence and uptake. 

I think this becomes especially true when some people who've had the vaccine get really sick for a day or two, and start tweeting about it...and then people get scared because they don't understand that it's perfectly ok and a normal reaction as the immune system gets to work and learns what's going on.

Sorry I sidetracked, but I just want you to know that I really appreciate your in-depth answer. If more people were like you we'll have no more anti-vaccers and a 99% uptake on this vaccine. 🤗",,,1605672598,{},gcoqtc5,False,t3_jw0yhq,False,False,t1_gcooss7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jw0yhq/pfizer_may_be_within_days_of_filing_emergency/gcoqtc5/,1605731235,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You have to get infected with Covid.

You have to get tested

Your test has to be sequenced 

You have to catch a different strain of Covid

You have to be tested 

Your second test has to be sequenced as well.

Sequencing of a viral test is not simple and costs a moderate amount of money.   It is not normally done.
So both times tests act as a gate restricting the number of people that show as reinfected.  
Even more so when 40% odd percent of people are likely to be asymptomatic in one of the infections. 
Every time someone says that reinfection is rare I hear the news from last year in my head.  With different strains of the virus, the one that is more contagious tends to become dominant in a geographic area.  So your odds of encountering a second strain are rather slim. 

No evidence of person to person spread.
No evidence that it spreads easily.
No evidence of airborne transmission.
So forgive me if I take that claim with a chunk of salt.

[],,ThorianB,,,[],,,,text,t2_3mviiajw,False,False,[],"From worst to best:

Group 1: Anti-masker/ hoax/just the flu/freedom/etc. group: This group never wears a mask and will often try to make excuses, use conspiracies, claim they have  freedom of choice( they don't) to wear a mask, or even  become belligerent  rather than just wear a mask and social distance. They will put 10x the effort into not masking up and social distancing than what it would actually take to just don a mask and social distance.

Group 2: The "" only do it because we have to"" crowd"": This group often acts like children and only put on a mask where it is required because it is required. If they walk into an establishment and see an owner/staff not wearing a mask they will often ask if its ok if they don't wear theirs as well. They are the last ones to put a mask on going in to a store and the first ones to take it off/down. Often they will wait until in the actual store before putting it on and take it off before hitting the foyer. This group is also the most likely group to wear it below the nose and pull it down or off when they are in parts of the store where they are alone. They act exactly like children trying not to get caught doing what they are told.

Group 3: The good intentions but don't put a lot of thought into it crowd: This group genuinely cares about not catching covid and they do as they are told because they want to avoid catching it not because someone is making them. They are following guidelines (mostly) as instructed but tend to often make poor decisions that reduce the effectiveness of their following the guidelines.  They will often include people in their bubble without knowing who is in that person's bubble and trusting that person to be honest about it.

My mother is in this group and a prime example is when she went over to see my 20 year old nieces house. My niece had strict parents and she is currently in the rebel phase and doesn't wear a mask( though i am told she wants some from christmas???). My mom thought it would be ok as long my niece and her boyfriend stayed outside and she wore a mask while in the house. I had to explain to her, just because my niece isnt in the house doesn't make it safe. It is still contaminated.  My mom had good intentions but made a poor choice that put her at a much higher risk.

Group 4: Serious guideline followers sometimes to the point of above and beyond: This group takes the guidelines as if it is life or death and for many of us in this group it is if we catch it. Masks are worn properly and at all times. They are put on long before you get to the building doors.  Hand sanitizer is not far away and we don't use public bathrooms unless it is an absolute emergency.  We follow one way aisles in stores. We try not to go out during busy times. We are careful about who is in our bubble and we scold or remove people who violate the rules. We limit our time outside of the house, use debit cards, pay at pump, and use delivery as much as possible. We keep up on virus news and we do our best to understand how it spreads so we can apply it to our lives and keep safe. Our goal is to survive until things return to normal, not try to have a normal life in the middle of a health crisis.

My wife and I are militant members of this group. My 80 year old mother spends 2-3 days a week at my house. We are the only socialization she normally gets. She was going to go to my brother's for Thanksgiving. His wife and him also take it pretty seriously and only have the two of them in their bubble. However she works in a mental health facility. Even though she has good PPE, it makes her higher risk.  I told my mother if she goes to my brother's for Thanksgiving, i will require her to quarantine for 14 days before she is allowed back in my bubble. I disowned my niece for her rebel stance and she was my favorite niece.

Put the following in the search options:

- Covid symptoms
- Covid testing
- Covid testing near me

Change date to whatever you’d like. I like to see 7 days, but often look at last day and in the mornings, after 9 AM, the past hour to see where potential new hot zones will emerge in next few weeks. 

The average time of search spikes for the above happens in the morning. 

Sometimes you see anomalies. States that go from being ranked in the teens or twenties suddenly pop up in the top 5. For example, in the past hour, New Hampshire holds the #3 spot in all the US for searches. This is new. They jumped up. If this holds stead and overall trend over next few days shows the increase in search volume, you can expect to see the wave begin there within the next 2-3 weeks. But sometimes a state will pop up and go back down a day or even hour later. Strange one as it’s 2 AM there. Why are so many searching for symptoms at 2 AM in NH? Who knows. Give it a few days and watch the volume and trend lines.

This has been a simple way to see where cases will pop up and even explode at least a could weeks in advance. 

Remember this lags... you have someone feeling ill, the search, go get tested, wait forever results, results come in, results are reported. There may be a good 2 weeks before that one case shows up in the numbers. Sometimes more.

The lag is almost providing a false sense of security for some. They think it’s not spreading in their area, while in the background they have no idea how many people around them are searching for testing sites and checking off the list of symptoms on a Google search.

Look at the colors of the map. The dark blues with search volume match exactly where cases are growing. I’ve been watching the US turn more and more blue from the top and making its way down as the cold weather makes its way down.

In all likelihood, the first coronavirus vaccines will begin rolling out to frontline workers and vulnerable populations in the last days of 2020, or possibly early 2021.

By Memorial Day in late May, it's possible that everyone in the US who wants a shot will have access.

But even after that, it may take several months to develop enough herd immunity through vaccination to make mass gatherings safe.

snip

First doses are likely to go to four groups of people: frontline healthcare workers, essential workers, people over 65, and those with preexisting conditions who are more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infections. 

It's likely this process will begin over the winter, possibly as early as December 2020, or January 2021.
 

In that phase, about 25 to 30 million Americans in the four high-priority groups could be getting vaccinated every month, Moncef Slaoui, the scientist in charge of the US government's coronavirus vaccine drive, said recently at the White House.

By springtime, vaccines could be rolling out to healthy members of the general public who aren't working on the front lines 

snip

""By the time we get through December, January, February, March, April, we hopefully will have been able to get to the people who are listed as priority people,"" Fauci said. ""I would say starting in April, May, June, July, as we get into the late spring and early summer, that people in the so-called general population, who do not have underlying conditions or other designations that would make them priority, could get them. This does not mean that in April  everybody who is going to be wanting a vaccine who is not a priority group is going to get it. It means starting at that point, you would likely begin."" 

By Memorial Day 2021, many Americans will likely have access to coronavirus vaccines, but full coverage will require more than one shot each

snp

Fauci told the New York Times on Tuesday that ""at least 75%, hopefully close to 80, 85%"" of the country would need to be vaccinated by fall 2021, in order to get ""close to some degree of normality."" 

""What I would like to see is the overwhelming majority of people get vaccinated so we can, essentially, really crush this outbreak,"" he said.

It's literally just people using transport to go to some faraway place and do stuff like go to restaurants, visit museums, etc, same stuff that locals do, just at a higher, concentrated intensity. All we have to do is solve the transport part, make it more environmentally friendly. We could invent planes powered by electricity, if it's possible for cars it will be possible for planes one day. Or ships. We could also phase out most plane travel in favour of train travel for shorter distances, like between European countries. Trust me, most tourists don't actually like traveling by air, it's a huge hassle, they do it because travelling by land is so much slower. High speed rail could change that. Or maybe even (gasp!) getting more vacation days per year. When people only have like three or four weeks, it's understandable they don't want to waste 4 or 5 days of their trip on getting there.

And you're completely wrong about the impact of travel on the mind. Research shows experiences make people happier than things. My parents took me to so many trips abroad when I was a kid, and I'm definitely a different person because of it, those very very formative experiences. I still remember most of my trips vividly no matter how long ago they've been. Everyone knows that other countries exist, but it's completely different when you go there and see for yourself, many people who don't travel unconsciously hold this view that their country is the centre of the world and everywhere else is ""somewhere else"", because they're unable to detach it from their point of view. But going to a different country, they stand there and it feels just as ""real"" to them as their home country, no longer just an abstract concept.

He has never understood that he  lacks a general power to rule by decree.”

The  federal government does have broad constitutional authority over states  on things that cross state lines and involve the entire nation, such as  regulating interstate commerce and immigration, levying taxes or  declaring war.

Williams said that 93 percent of staff who have contracted the virus did so in the community, and that the majority of those who contracted the virus at work did so while eating in a break room with a mask off.

“It shows you how easy it is to get COVID-19 in the Midwest,” said Willams, during an afternoon press call. “Our staff are being infected mostly due to community spread, and this impacts our ability to care for patients. **We need everyone in the communities we serve to do their part to limit the spread of COVID-19.”**

The 900 staff newly diagnosed with COVID-19 equals over one-third of the 2,981 Mayo employees diagnosed since the start of the outbreak. When you add in staff who are quarantined or taken offline in order to care for relatives, the clinic is currently experiencing a stable shortage of 1,500 staff systemwide, 1,000 in Rochester.

In other news, with 32 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the clinic’s General Medicine ICU dedicated for the care of COVID-19, the clinic has filled all of its allotted ICU beds for the virus in Rochester, and is in the process of expanding that center by 12 to 13 beds.

“We have 32 COVID patients needing tertiary care, and that’s not good,” Williams said. “It tells us we’re in a surge.”

The clinic has 18 specialty ICU wards in Rochester total with multiple beds in each, but those floors are designed to treat a host of other patients whose numbers are not decreasing.

Williams said there are currently 73 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in a non-ICU setting at Mayo, 255 system-wide.

In northwest Wisconsin, Mayo has hospitalized 79 COVID-19 patients, nine in an ICU. In southeast Minnesota, Mayo has hospitalized 11 COVID-19 patients, three in an ICU. In southwest Minnesota, Mayo has hospitalized 38 COVID-19 patients, five in an ICU. And in southwest Wisconsin, Mayo has hospitalized 22 COVID-19 patients, one in an ICU.

“All of our hospitals are really stretched,” said Williams, “and many are absolutely full.” That said, Williams maintained that “we continue to have capacity for anybody who needs our care.”

The clinic is also managing “hundreds and hundreds” of COVID-19 patients in an outpatient setting, including many with the drug remdesivir, after discharge, freeing up pressure on beds and staff.",,,1605701564,{},gcpmo2k,True,t3_jweod5,False,False,t3_jweod5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jweod5/900_on_mayo_clinic_staff_have_contracted/gcpmo2k/,1605750393,52,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; The drug maker Pfizer said on Wednesday that its coronavirus vaccine was 95 percent effective and had no serious side effects — the first set of complete results from a late-stage vaccine trial as Covid-19 cases skyrocket around the globe.

&gt; The data showed that the vaccine prevented mild and severe forms of Covid-19, the company said. And it was 94 percent effective in older adults, who are more vulnerable to developing severe Covid-19 and who do not respond strongly to some types of vaccines.

&gt; Pfizer, which developed the vaccine with its partner BioNTech, said the companies planned to apply to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization “within days,” raising hopes that a working vaccine could soon become a reality.

&gt; The trial results — less than a year after researchers began working on the vaccine — shattered all speed records for vaccine development, a process that usually takes years.

&gt; “The study results mark an important step in this historic eight-month journey to bring forward a vaccine capable of helping to end this devastating pandemic,” Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s chief executive, said in a statement.

&gt; If the F.D.A. authorizes the two-dose vaccine, Pfizer has said that it could have up to 50 million doses available by the end of the year, and up to 1.3 billion by the end of next year.

&gt; However, only about half of its supply will go to the United States this year, or enough for about 12.5 million people — a sliver of the American population of 330 million. Americans will receive the vaccine for free, under a $1.95 billion deal the federal government reached with Pfizer for 100 million doses.

&gt; The results align with an early analysis that Pfizer and BioNTech reported last week, which found that the vaccine was more than 90 percent effective. Then on Monday, the drug maker Moderna reported that its vaccine was 94.5 percent effective in an early analysis.

&gt; Pfizer and BioNTech’s trial included nearly 44,000 volunteers, half of whom received the vaccine. The other half received a placebo shot of salt water. Then the researchers waited to see how many in each group developed Covid-19.

&gt; The companies said that out of 170 cases of Covid-19, 162 were in the placebo group, and eight were in the vaccine group. Out of 10 cases of severe Covid-19, nine had received a placebo.

&gt; Pfizer and BioNTech said that the vaccine’s efficacy was consistent across age, race and ethnicity. The most common serious adverse event was fatigue, with 3.7 percent of volunteers reporting tiredness after they took the second dose. Two percent of volunteers reported a headache after the second dose. Older adults reported fewer and milder side effects, the companies said.

&gt; “It’s pretty amazing,” said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University. She said the results in people over 65 were the most promising. “We know from the influenza vaccine that it’s very difficult to achieve protection in this age group with vaccines,” she said, so 94 percent efficacy in that group “is really remarkable.”

&gt; Federal health officials have said the first doses of the vaccines will most likely go to groups like health care workers who are at high risk for exposure, as well as to people who are most vulnerable to the disease, such as older people.

&gt; Dr. Saad B. Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, said the results showing the vaccines protected people from severe disease was also good news, because with such limited availability initially, the first goal will be not to stop transmission of the disease, but to prevent people from becoming extremely ill. “So that is very reassuring,” he said.

&gt; He called on Pfizer to quickly release a more detailed analysis of the data — beyond the initial news release — so that scientists could more thoroughly evaluate the results. The companies have said they plan to submit the results for review in a scientific journal, a process that can take weeks or months. “These are not normal times, this is a pandemic, and major policy is being made,” Dr. Omer said. “It’s always better to make policy on scientific data, not a press release.”

&gt; In addition to the results of its clinical trial, Pfizer said it was ready to submit to the F.D.A. two months of safety data that the agency had recommended, as well as detailed manufacturing records showing the company can consistently produce high-quality batches of its product. The F.D.A. will review the data and ask an outside panel of vaccine experts to weigh in on the application, a process that could take weeks.

&gt; Both Pfizer and Moderna have said the accelerating pace of the pandemic has had the silver lining of speeding up their trials, since volunteers are becoming infected with the virus more quickly.

&gt; Pfizer and Moderna have developed vaccines that use a new technology that has never before been approved for human use. Both use a synthetic version of coronavirus genetic material, called mRNA, to program a person’s cells to churn out many copies of a fragment of the virus. That fragment sets off alarms in the immune system and stimulates it to attack if the person is exposed to the real virus.

&gt; If the vaccine is authorized, attention will immediately shift to how it will be distributed. The vaccine must be stored at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit, colder than any other vaccine in development. Pfizer will ship the vaccine in special boxes of 1,000 to 5,000 doses that are stuffed with dry ice and equipped with GPS-enabled sensors. Pfizer’s vaccine can be stored in conventional freezers for up to five days, or in the special coolers for up to 15 days, as long the dry ice is replenished and the boxes are not opened more than twice a day.

&gt; Moderna’s vaccine must also be stored in a freezer long-term, but at minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit. The company said on Monday that its vaccine could be stored in the freezer for up to 30 days, not seven as previously thought, which could make it easier to store than the Pfizer vaccine.",,,1605701445,{},gcpmj4o,True,t3_jwenib,False,True,t3_jwenib,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jwenib/new_pfizer_results_coronavirus_vaccine_is_safe/gcpmj4o/,1605750316,4,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

She never left the hospital and her condition worsened between November to December and was put into palliative care.

I bring this up because my stepdad and brother both downplay this pandemic. They suffered through watching my mom go onto a ventilator, and she ultimately could not breath at the end. We at least got to be with her and she was aware for a large portion of the time. It’s like they forgot this war my mom endured.

Today, people do not get to see their loved ones and if hospitals get overwhelmed preventable deaths will occur. I never thought I would say I am relieved my mom died when she did, but with how things are now I think I am. If the same series of events occurred today I don’t think we would be able to see her and she would have died alone thinking no one cared. She had depression and extreme anxiety.

According to a [press release](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2020/attorney-general-james-stops-three-amazon-sellers-price-gouging-hand-sanitizer) from the office of New York AG Letitia James, the three sellers agreed to pay back a combined $23,000 to customers who purchased the overpriced hand sanitizer and also agreed to pay $52,500 in penalties, fees, and costs.

James' office says that the three Amazon sellers — Northwest-Lux, Mobile Rush and EMC Group, Inc — sold hand sanitizer online at a substantial markup in February and early March when the coronavirus began to arrive in the U.S.

At that time, hand sanitizer had quickly disappeared from store shelves as stores weren't prepared for skyrocketing demand. According to James' office, that's when the three Amazon sellers began selling sanitizer online at an enormous markup.

The Attorney General's office says Northwest-Lux charged customers as much as $130 for a 2-liter bottle of hand sanitizer that typically sells for $20. The press release says Mobile Rush charged up to $30 for an 8 0z. bottle of Germ-X — which typically sllls for about $2. EMC was selling eight packs of Purell for up to $53 — a price increase of up to $41.

James's office says that customers who purchased the overpriced items will receive restitution, which will be applied directly to their credit or debit cards.“",,,1605717352,{},gcqdiei,True,t3_jwj03i,False,False,t3_jwj03i,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jwj03i/3_amazon_sellers_ordered_to_repay_23000_to/gcqdiei/,1605765287,16,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

My MIL is so, so mad about the Covid deniers. She told my husband (Zoom call) that she thinks anyone who won't wear a mask should be forced to sign an agreement that they'll just die at home and won't go to the hospital. 

In March and April, she and my FIL vacationed at their time share and invited their financial advisor and husband who live in another state to their property. I know they have had numerous parties since March, but they limit the number of guests and ""distance.""

They also organized several protests and worked at the polls. I mean, I'm proud of them for caring and somebody has to do it, but they didn't have to do all the other stuff. And they're old with medical conditions. 

Recently MIL's Trumpy brother contracted Covid and was hospitalized. We got a lot of eye rolling texts from them about how irresponsible he was. And he was. So, so irresponsible. I really had to hold in ""but so are you and it's only a matter of time before you get it if you don't stop having parties.""

MIL is very extroverted and isolating is her worst nightmare. I feel like I've been training for a pandemic all my life. I get it's a different sacrifice. But a lot of what my in-laws are doing is Covid theater, wearing marks because that's what good people should do, without really being willing to change other behaviors that others can't see as easily.
