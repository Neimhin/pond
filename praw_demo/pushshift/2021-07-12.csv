[],,FreakDC,,,[],,,,text,t2_cjp0q,False,False,[],"&gt;This is not a real concern. The mRNA vaccines target the spike protein, so if the virus mutates so much that the vaccines are no longer effective, it has simultaneously mutated itself out of being able to infect humans at all.

That's false. A spike protein is composed out of roughly 1000-1500 amino acids and it varies from virus to virus. Many, many variants can interact with the human  ACE2 receptor. All the different human coronaviruses have different spike proteins, that can all infect us and none of our current anti bodies that work against those coronaviruses work against COVID19. That's why it's novel.

We've also already seen mutations that changed the spike protein for COVID19, thankfully so far those mutations have not affected immunity for people with antibodies negatively.

It's entirely feasible that a mutation changes the spike proteins enough to (mostly) avoid the anti bodies formed by the mRNA vaccines but still being able to interact with the ACE2 receptor.

This is called a shift. This is to be expected at some point given enough mutations. This is relatively rare but it's precisely the reason why we want to keep the active virus mass (i.e. infected humans) as low as possible. The more people get infected the higher the chance for a shift.  


It's highly likely to get something called a drift, small enough changes that are still mostly being identified as COVID by our anti bodies. We already see this with the known variants.

E.g. the Biontech vaccine seems to be slightly less effective vs the Delta variant.

Enough drift and you might require a booster shot to get good protection again.

Drift means you don't start at 0 since there is some kind of protection for some portion of the vaccinated populous. E.g. 50% less infections and 70% less hospitalizations. Enough to slow down the spread but not enough to stop it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And, even if some currently unpredictable or unexplainable scenario happens in which the virus evades mRNA vaccines but does remain infectious (which from my understanding would be ridiculously unlikely), 

Again, it's much more likely than you think with hundreds of millions of infections and the scenario is far from unexplainable. 

mRNA vaccines, as much of a breakthrough they are, are not magic. All they do is offer a vessel to contain information for the body to produce antigens/proteins on its own. It's a shortcut to producing the antigens directly in the body instead of outside of it in a lab. It's a quicker process and apparently it looks like it can be more precise but in the end all it does it create antigens (in this case the spike protein) in the body. If those no longer match the virus, the immunity is gone or heavily diminished.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;the breakthrough in mRNA technology as a result of this pandemic would allow us to effectively alter the vaccines almost instantly.

You are correct, we can develop mRNA booster shots within weeks. The issue is, if the old vaccine no longer works due to a shift we would have to start from zero again and we lose the progress we made from the first 3.5 billion doses of various vaccines we administered. It's taken us 7 month to get where we are now.

Anyway my thoughts… France has a “fondness” for homeopathic remedies which is bigger than I think most people realise/admit. For example I herniated a disc in my lower back at the start of the year moving heavy furniture. Almost everyone I know told me to go to a chiropractor rather than have an MRI and follow medical advice. When I say I had an MRI and followed the spine specialists advice people look at as if I am weird. My sister in law also herniated a disc in her back ten years ago and still has issues and goes to a chiropractor a few times a year still! Whereas my back is basically fine now. She had an MRI after three(!) years (which is how she knows it is a herniated disc) but never followed up and just keeps going to a chiropractor 🤦‍♂️ 

When covid hit almost everyone we know didn’t take it that seriously. They ignored the measures of not mixing households etc so we know many people who have had covid. Some of them badly and a few have friends or family that died. Yet they still play with fire ignoring the advice. 

As for anti vax specifically I feel social media is the biggest factor. My parents in law refuse it as they honestly believe there is a massive cover up of vaccine related deaths. In the range of *millions* of people. They believe all the crap they read on Facebook and “news” sites. 

I don’t know how true that is for other people but it certainly true of a few people we know. Also many people just don’t trust/like Macron. They think he is lying about how serious covid is and just doing all this to stay in power.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html)

An excerpt:

&gt;The C.D.C.’s own calculations suggest that it is extremely difficult to detect any live virus in a sample above a threshold of 33 cycles. Officials at some state labs said the C.D.C. had not asked them to note threshold values or to share them with contact-tracing organizations.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Officials at the Wadsworth Center, New York’s state lab, have access to C.T. values from tests they have processed, and analyzed their numbers at The Times’s request. In July, the lab identified 872 positive tests, based on a threshold of 40 cycles.  
&gt;  
&gt;With a cutoff of 35, about 43 percent of those tests would no longer qualify as positive. About 63 percent would no longer be judged positive if the cycles were limited to 30.  
&gt;  
&gt;In Massachusetts, from 85 to 90 percent of people who tested positive in July with a cycle threshold of 40 would have been deemed negative if the threshold were 30 cycles, Dr. Mina \[an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health\] said. “I would say that none of those people should be contact-traced, not one,” he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Other experts informed of these numbers were stunned.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I’m really shocked that it could be that high — the proportion of people with high C.T. value results,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. “Boy, does it really change the way we need to be thinking about testing.”",,,,1626134070,{},h4zanwx,False,t3_oiqg9x,False,False,t1_h4xlt9l,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oiqg9x/onethird_of_young_travellers_who_tested_negative/h4zanwx/,1626305502,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

We had already extended 2nd shots to up to 16 weeks I believe to get as many people their first dose as possible. As the Delta variant started becoming more prominent world wide and it didn't look like a single dose was super great against fighting it (I believe some reports suggested 33% efficacy) it was thought a better direction would be to get as many people 2nd doses as possible. 

We know both Pfizer and Moderna are extremely similar and are essentially eliciting the same response for the same spike protein it was deemed it would be safe to mix and match mRNA vaccines. 

Mixing vaccines isn't un-common and is done frequently world wide. 

Here you can find why they recommended it including sources to their reasoning.

Vaccines work very well, but it's too early to go wild with re-opening especially when full vaccination rate is not that high.

As I say, the vast majority of cases at the moment are among the under 35 age group. They're out socialising regularly.

That more and more diseases are resistant does not come from bacteria getting into contact with people who don't get antibiotics, it comes from bacteria getting into contact with antibiotics and only the more resistance mutations surviving longer that thus have a better chance of spreading.

If we want to reduce the likelihood of vaccine resistance virus strains, we must make sure that any contact of a vaccinated person with the virus ends as quickly as possible, this means as high a vaccine effectiveness as possible.

Now I do know the vaccine is not 100% effective but overall the at risk groups will be fully vaccinated and even those with 1 jab will have milder symptoms plus will likely be younger anyway so we don't to be too concerned.

For the unvaccinated we already know that generally covid has less of an effect on children (apart from affecting education when isolating) so we don't need to be overly concerned about them. The 13% of adults that have so far refused the jab are the ones most at risk. That's about 6.75m adults who will be most at risk.

Now the question is why should we hold back society for a group of people who do not want to help themselves? I know there are other considerations such as the risk of new variants but on the whole society should not go out of the way to protect antivaxxers after doing their best to persuade them to get jabbed.

We also need to get over this obsession with case numbers. We have never counted the number of flu cases but only those in hospital/dying. If we hark back to march 2020 the reason for lockdown was to stop the NHS being overwhelmed. As long as the NHS is not at risk of being overstretched then we shouldn't be locking down.

&gt;  
&gt;Reuters reported last month that the European Medicines Agency (EMA)’s review of the drug’s safety and efficacy was delayed because a June 10 deadline to submit data on the vaccine's clinical trials was missed, according to one of those people, who is close to the agency, and another person familiar with the matter. The EMA is the European Union’s medicines watchdog.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The hitches go beyond that one deadline, the person close to the agency said. As of early June, the EMA had received hardly any manufacturing data, and the clinical data the agency had received was incomplete, the person said.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Separately, an assessment of Sputnik V by a French delegation of scientists in advance of the EMA review found that the vaccine developers were unable to document that the so-called master cell bank, the initial building block of the vaccine, complied with specific EU regulation on preventing disease contamination, according to four people with knowledge of the delegation's findings.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The EMA, which launched its formal review of the Russian vaccine in March, had previously been expected to decide in May or June whether to approve use of the drug in the EU.The person close to the EMA said notable missing clinical information during the EMA review included case report forms that record any adverse effects people experienced after receiving the jab in trials. It is standard practice for developers to submit such forms, this person added. It was also not clear how the scientists working on the vaccine tracked the outcomes of people given a placebo, the person said.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The watchdog rates such data shortcomings on a scale that goes from “critical” - the most serious - to “major” to “minor.” The person said nothing had met the critical threshold, “but there are several ‘majors,’” indicating issues that can be remedied but require much work. The person added they didn’t expect the review to be completed until after the summer.

From a NY Magazine article on the subject:

“But on that point mass vaccination in the United States has utterly changed the landscape of the pandemic: not only by protecting those who have received shots, indeed astonishingly well, but by changing the calculus for all those who haven’t, by eliminating almost all of the mortality risk of the population at large. All told, 80 percent of American deaths have been among those 65 and above. According to the White House, 90 percent of American seniors are now fully vaccinated. Which means that while more cases are likely and some amount of hospitalization and death, as well, vaccines have eliminated the overwhelming share of American mortality risk, with the disease now circulating almost exclusively among people who can endure it much, much better — kids especially.”",,,,1626167589,{},h50ohlf,False,t3_oj2dw9,False,False,t1_h4zy6pz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oj2dw9/california_covid_cases_surge_1814_in_past_week/h50ohlf/,1626331978,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

From what I’ve seen, the Astra Zeneca shot May actually do a better job with T cells. People who get an Astro Zeneca shot first and the Moderna shot second wind up having fairly competitive antibody levels, but double the T cell levels. The mRNA vaccine makers put a “lock“ on the protein spike to stop it from changing shape when it connects to a cell. That seems to have really helped our immune systems effectively build up lots of antibodies against it. But my (totally speculative) theory is that by allowing the spikes to connect to cells, the Astra Zeneca shot actually gave our immune systems more opportunity for T cells to learn how to handle infected cells.

When the original trials came out, the Pfizer shots were new and at their peak, so everybody was dazzled by the antibody action, which seem to give sterilizing immunity. The high T cell count in the Astra Zeneca shot seemed like a booby prize in comparison, and nobody cared; why worry about T cell reaction if another vaccine can stop you from getting sick in the first place?

But as you said, the T cell response probably lasts a lot longer. Which means that in the long run, the Astra Zeneca shot could actually be a bit more effective, or at least more competitive than most people think.

By the way, there is some very early evidence that the Moderna  shot may turn out to be longer lasting than the Pfizer. They use triple the dose of mRNA. Initially, that kind of seemed like overkill that led to stronger side effects. But it’s possible the Delta variant needs such a big antibody response to tackle it effectively that the Moderna begins to get the edge. But it’s hard to tell because that vaccine wasn’t as widespread early on, and when it was used in the UK they usually mixed and matched it with the Astra Zeneca, making it hard to do direct comparisons.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The CDC are not dealing with  that unfortunate reality when they are creating these policies.

I don't think the CDC has any other option other than a recommendation for continued masking and social distancing as has been the case throughout the lockdown period. CDC couldnt enforce any of their own recomendation at the height of the lockdown during the series of waves we had. Lockdown only worked in the states that took them seriously and that is because the residents of the states collectively did what needed to be done. You really think anyone is listening to CDC reccomendations right now other than when they want to?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And btw- delta is a problem for those of us vaccinated. So they didn’t even follow the fucking science on this one.

the vaccine protects the inoculated from serious illness from the look of things. and the delta variant is really not [spreading equally across the entire country](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases-50-states) and the vaccines are the most likely causal variable here.  Are you dinging CDC for the vaccine not perfectly preventing infection? No vaccine has ever been perfect and preventing infection, ever. So in my own opinion, CDC made a reasonable recommendation for the sane members of society.

The vaccines work. But we have to stop the spread before it continues to mutate and they are no longer effective.

Canada studies show 88% protection against symptomatic infection with Delta - https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.28.21259420v1

Scotland has shown 79% against infection - https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01358-1/fulltext

Israel shows 64-70% against infection - https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-is-less-effective-against-delta-variant-israeli-data-show-11625572796

Singapore shows 69% against infection.

So we land somewhere between 64% and 88%, likely somewhere in the middle. 

Some of the best studies come from Singaporean contact tracers.  Singapore has high vaccination rates with mRNA and they’re still seeing tons of asymptomatic spread even via fully-vaccinated individuals:   https://twitter.com/michaelzlin/status/1409707511519748102?s=21

Today begins phase three of the 9/100 Vaccination Plan , called No Contagion.

Its objective is to inoculate people between 48 and 16 years old; more those who are in a situation of mobility. It will run until September 5.

The number of inhabitants in this age range is 8.5 million, according to the population projections of the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses ( INEC ).

This represents 68.7% of the 12.4 million, which are part of the target population identified by the Ministry of Public Health (MSP).

The dynamics will be similar to the one that took place in previous weeks, that is, each day an age group will be served. For example, today it is up to people who are 48 years old; tomorrow at 47; Wednesday, at 46, etc.
On weekends, latecomers may come, that is, those who did not make it on the assigned day.

This will be done until the 26th of this month. On that date, the modality will change again: two days for each age, said José Ruales , vice minister.

The Portfolio has planned to open new vaccination points. In Quito, after a unification, it went from 51 to 24 sites. But, the week before, there were long lines at the campuses, including Bicentenario and Universidad Salesiana, in the north, and the Paulo VI and Consejo Provincial schools, in the south.

Therefore, the decision was to enable five more points, located in the universities : Católica, De las Américas, UTE, San Francisco and Hemisferios.

La Católica reopens today from 08:00 to 17:00, with 10 brigades. Its capacity is 1,500 people per day. ""The processes will be simplified to speed up the inoculation,"" explained Silvana Ortiz , Dean of Nursing.

In the UDLA, on the other hand, they are already organizing to open the space to the public, from Monday to Friday. Currently it only works on weekends.

On Saturday and Sunday, for example, the immunization of the students was carried out. The doses were scheduled to be applied to 16,000 young people from all majors, including graduate students. It was done at the Granados campuses and at UDLA Park, confirmed Marlena León, academic vice-rector.

""With these initiatives, the progressive return to face-to-face classes is expected.""

The university also provides for the immunization of its former graduates. There will be more than 50,000 citizens.

In the UTE, on the other hand, the students will begin to be vaccinated from Tuesday , in alphabetical order. While the USFQ is supported with the placement of doses to workers in the tourism sector.

To qualify more points, the MSP will have the support of the National Electoral Council ( CNE ) and the Red Cross.

Diana Atamaint , president of the CNE, recalled that they made the more than 4,000 electoral precincts available to become vaccination sites. “Everyone is available. Now it depends on Health and its operational capacity: personnel and supplies ”.

In this sense, the Portfolio coordinated with the Quito Health Secretariat for the hiring of 40 vaccinators. They will go to the new sites.

The Ministry of Health has also strengthened alliances with private companies. Adelca, for example, enabled a vaccination center in its sports center, located in Alóag, since June 7. This week it will reach 5,000 people.

The firms are also immunizing their workers. Grupo DK - which brings together shopping centers such as Quicentro and Granados Plaza - began with the administration of doses last Thursday. Megamaxi did the same.

For Víctor Álvarez, president of the College of Physicians of Pichincha , vaccination had a wrong start, but now it is progressing at a better pace. “There is an adequate process and clear objectives. The organization still needs to be adjusted ”.

Therefore, it calls for greater openness to the unions. They can help with logistics and volunteers for immunization. ""Months ago we managed to inoculate 4,000 doctors.""

Epidemiologist Daniel Simancas agrees with his peer. To achieve the goal of vaccinating 9 million citizens it
is essential to have the doses of CanSino . It was announced that 700,000 will arrive until next August.

The reason is that only one is required. ""This will reach the largest number of the population and face the arrival of strong variants, such as the Delta (identified in India).",,,,1626132094,{},h4z6xsf,False,t3_oityy6,False,True,t3_oityy6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oityy6/mass_vaccination_starts_in_ecuador_this_july_12/h4z6xsf/,1626303401,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Canada studies show 88% protection against symptomatic infection - https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.28.21259420v1

Scotland has shown 79% against infection - https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01358-1/fulltext

Singapore shows 69% against infection.


So we land somewhere between 64% and 88%, likely somewhere in the middle. 

Some of the best studies come from Singaporean contact tracers.  Singapore has high vaccination rates with mRNA and they’re still seeing tons of asymptomatic spread even via fully-vaccinated individuals:   https://twitter.com/michaelzlin/status/1409707511519748102?s=21

[],,acousticflouzy,,,[],,,,text,t2_24ejgl6g,False,False,[],"I think it's about vaccine incentivisation as well because high levels of vaccination are still more effective against covid than travel restrictions.

Like if you take the fire analogy you hear sometimes: Unvaccinated people are like dry wood, vaccinated people are like wet wood, travel restrictions are walls and doors. We only have supportive therapy so there's no firehose. 

So the heavy travel restriction approach is great when there's no covid in the country, like in Australia until recently. However, once its in the room like a piece of dry wood on fire, those walls and doors aren't as helpful as they were before.

Social distancing is good for a while but people can't sit still nafurally, entropy always wins so that's a  temporary solution 

Therefor you gotta vaccinate the people and wet the metaphorical wood pieces. However, letting vaccinated people travel is good for this reason. Bringing in more wet wood can tip the population towards a vaccinated majority (this is a fairly small number if you try and compare them to countries but it would make a difference in popular cities where vaccinated immigrants would favour). 

The key here is high vaccine proportion for heard immunity. Very broadly speaking, a higher vax/non-vax ratio + more people is still safer than a lower ratio and less people. It also means the population gets less sick from said disease as vaccinated people aren't likely to be taking up ventilator beds/resources. Higher rates of vaccination means being able to tolerate higher covid numbers. Look at Ireland for example, it's hospitalisation numbers are way lower proportionately to when the numbers were the same last year.

The scary thing is that if there's a big non-vax cohort, they are basically covids playground. The interplay between vax and non vax people with covid is what leads to more variants that could eventually overpower the current vaccines. 

So the goal is to raise the vax proportion not just as high as possible, but to do it faster than covid can evolve.

Taiwan had tried for months to get the vaccine from the German company, until on Sunday BioNTech's Chinese sales agent, which also has the right to sell the shot to the island, said it would sell 10 million doses to two Taiwanese tech giants, after Taiwan's government said they could negotiate on their behalf.

Taiwan has blamed China for the collapse of a direct deal with BioNTech in January, allegations Beijing strongly denies.

Shieh Jhy-wey, Taiwan's de facto ambassador to Berlin, said the original English language press release which was meant to have announced the agreement on Jan. 6 mentioned five million doses would have been supplied in batches by July.

But two days later, on Jan. 8, Shieh said a different person at BioNTech than they had previously been communicating with began returning messages.

""The English was mixed with simplified Chinese characters to request 'our country' be changed to 'Taiwan', and from then on it all came crumbling down,"" he added, writing on his Facebook page and referring to the draft press release.

Simplified characters are used in China, whereas Taiwan uses traditional characters. China claims Taiwan as its own territory and strongly objects to any wording that implies the island is a country.

BioNTech did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Taiwan Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said in May, when the government first gave details of what had happened, that they had agreed to change the wording to just ""Taiwan"", but it was from that point on the agreement stalled.

Shieh said his description of what had happened ""was of course 'political interference'"".

""Yet who? It goes without saying,"" he added.

""However, during the whole process of coordination and negotiation behind the scenes, not only me, but also members of parliament and German officials strongly felt the high willingness and enthusiasm of BioNTech's top management to supply Taiwan with vaccines.""

Germany, like most countries, has no official diplomatic ties with Taiwan.

Japan will ship out 1 million doses each to Indonesia, Taiwan and Vietnam on Thursday as part of bilateral deals with those governments, Motegi told reporters.

An additional 11 million doses donated through the COVAX sharing scheme will be sent this month to Bangladesh, Cambodia, Iran, Laos, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, as well as various Pacific Island states, he said.

Taiwan's Foreign Ministry expressed thanks for the gesture, particularly at a serious stage in Japan's own coronavirus battle. Japan has donated about 3.4 million doses to Taiwan in a show of support for the Chinese-claimed island.

""The friendship between Taiwan and Japan is unwavering,"" the Taiwan ministry said in a statement. ""The Foreign Ministry once again thanks our partners in freedom and democracy for their warm assistance and strong support.""

In a statement, Vietnam said it would receive a million doses from Japan on Friday in the southern business hub of Ho Chi Minh City, where it is fighting its largest outbreak yet after months of successful containment.

""It is encouraging that a number of richer countries have made generous pledges and donations of vaccines to countries in Asia in recent weeks,"" said Alexander Matheou of aid group the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

""We need to speed up the delivery of these lifesaving doses so that we can get them into people's arms, giving us a genuine shot at containing this pandemic once and for all.""

Taiwan has complained that Chinese interference blocked its deal this year to secure vaccines from Germany's BioNTech SE (22UAy.DE), charges Beijing has denied. Since then, vaccine donations have rolled in to Taiwan.

Taiwan's relatively small domestic COVID-19 outbreak has generally been brought under control, except for a few sporadic community infections.
Japan has pledged $1 billion and 30 million doses to COVAX. Motegi said on Tuesday the AstraZeneca doses made in Japan were approved by the World Health Organization on July 9 for use in COVAX.

People can and have been reinfected especially by the variants, it is pretty common. So it does benefit them and more importantly everybody around them.

Boy I'd fucking *love* to hear this one. Chemo patients and kids don't count because they have actual reasons. Let me see what you got.

&gt; Maybe you should try to understand the other side of this argument

We have, the problem is the other side of the argument argues in bad faith and constantly shifts the goalposts as more and more info becomes available, as we see how incredibly safe the vaccines are, what a dramatic effect they have on case numbers, and how they reduce severity of symptoms for the few cases that do slip through.

At this point most of the anti-vaxxers are saying ""I don't have to get it bc herd immunity"" (which doesn't exist anymore, COVID is too aggressive and is projected to infect all unvaccinated people within a year with the Delta variant assuming no others show up) or ""we don't know the long term effects that will show up in 5 years!!!"" which flies in the face of pretty much all vaccine science (there will be no long-term effects besides antibodies).

Nobody is dehumanizing anybody. Dipshits who refuse to get vaccinated are humans. They're selfish, ignorant, stupid humans. People have tried for months and months to handle these idiots with kid gloves on and they refuse to grow up, and most reasonable people are sick and tired of it.

Then, among other things, restrictions on the number of passengers on longer train and bus journeys disappear, and the regulation of square meters per person in shopping malls, gyms and museums.**

Low spread of infection, good vaccination rate and a decreasing burden on healthcare means that Sweden enters the next opening phase on Thursday 15 July. This was announced by the government on Monday.

\- Step by step, we are now moving towards a society free from restrictions, says Minister of Trade and Industry Ibrahim Baylan at the government's press conference. 

The relief means , among other things, that long-distance public transport no longer has to leave half of the places unbooked. The restriction on the number of people allowed to stay on a certain number of square meters in shops, gyms and amusement parks is also removed.The size of groups with designated seats at public gatherings or public events, such as sporting events, is increased from four to eight people. The announcement applies to both indoor and outdoor events. At the same time, companies must continue to keep a distance of one meter to other groups.

&gt;Facts. This will ease the restrictions on 15 July• Regulation on long-distance passenger restrictions public transport by train and bus is removed.• The municipalities' ability to decide on a residence ban specified places are revoked.• Regulation on square meters per person in indoor and outdoor environments is taken away, but congestion should continue to be avoided.• Rules for rides are removed.• The size of parties that have designated seats at a public gathering or a public event, such as a football match, is increased from four to eight people.Source: Government, Public Health Agency

The opening phase is the third of five in the government's plan for the abolition of coronary restrictions. The first was held on 1 June , when, among other things, the participation ceilings were raised and bars and restaurants had longer opening hours. One month later, on July 1, Sweden entered phase two , with new increases in the participation ceilings. The advice to shop alone and wear a mask in public transport was also removed.

The next step in the government's plan is planned for September, but may be revised depending on developments.

\- In order for the plan to continue, it is necessary that healthcare and the pressure on healthcare are kept down, and that the vaccination rate continues to increase, says Ibrahim Baylan, who also warns of the spread of new virus variants.

Despite the favorable situation in Sweden, state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell states that the spread of infection is increasing in several parts of the world. In Europe, countries such as Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are now seeing the number of new cases increase.

\- There you see very clear connections to the fact that restrictions have been removed quite quickly, but also that the mentioned delta variant has begun to dominate in more countries at a very fast pace, says Anders Tegnell.

It is therefore important that Swedes continue to follow the advice, otherwise an autumn with increased spread of infection can wait, according to Anders Tegnell.

What indicates that we do not get the same increase in Sweden when the relief is removed?

\- That we do not have this total removal of restrictions but on the contrary very carefully has taken one step at a time. What we are doing now on 15 July is still very cautious and relatively small changes.

Large parts of the spread of infection in countries such as Spain and the Netherlands have taken place in nightclubs - an environment that is still closed in Sweden. The current reliefs therefore do not involve an increased risk, according to Anders Tegnell.The fifth and final step in the government's decommissioning plan, when all restrictions are removed, has not yet been set.

We can look to other countries for some good info re vaccine efficacy vs Delta.

Canada studies show 88% protection against symptomatic infection - https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.28.21259420v1

Scotland has shown 79% against infection - https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01358-1/fulltext

Israel shows 64-70% against infection - https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-is-less-effective-against-delta-variant-israeli-data-show-11625572796

No one is denying that healthy people have died from COVID-19. Healthy people can die from the flu, or pneumonia, cancer, etc.

To say healthy people are dying while leaving out the broader contextual data is misleading though. (It would be like saying healthy people are dying from cancer, without mentioning other factors that put things in perspective.)

I would define someone as healthy, in the context of COVID-19, as having no underlying health conditions. So yes, while healthy (no underlying health conditions) people have died from COVID-19, these individuals only make up 6% of the deaths and 22% of ICU admittance [Source](http://protomag.com/articles/why-do-young-healthy-people-die-covid-19).

This is the shape you want your immune system to recognize - it's the shape that spike protein on a real virus will take. Some, but not all, COVID vaccines make use of prefusion stablization - it's a new technique so not all vaccine developers decided to use it. J&amp;J, Pfizer and Moderna made use of it. AZ did not, I believe Sputnik did not, and I'm not sure about other vaccines. 

There seems to be a substantial gap between the efficacy of AZ and J&amp;J when it comes to the Beta (formerly B.1.351 or ""South Africa"") variant - J&amp;J's phase 3 trial indicated strong (\~66%) efficacy, whereas a small trial indicated AZ had little to no efficacy against the Beta variant.

European Union: 90.62 (53.94), Sweden: 89.97 (54.7)

Looking at the leader board, Israel has a population of about 9 million, Mongolia about 3 million. Canada about 38 million, and the UK about 68 million. So in other words, the UK is the only country ahead of us without a really small population. 

But including all three countries ahead of us, our current vaccination pace is far higher than all three. It's roughly four times higher than that of the 2nd and 3rd place countries, and almost ten times higher than the leader Israel:

&gt; **Global Vaccine Pace Comparison:** doses per 100 people in the last week (**current vaccination velocity**):

&gt; Sweden: 9.09 ***Canada: 9.04*** Italy: 6.16 France: 5.84 Turkey: 5.84
Japan: 5.43 Argentina: 5.39 China: 5.35 European Union: 5.28 Germany: 5.24
Brazil: 4.31 Saudi Arabia: 3.92 Australia: 3.52 Russia: 3.25 Mexico: 2.81
**United Kingdom: 2.59** **Mongolia: 2.47** India: 2.17 Indonesia: 1.91 South Africa: 1.57
South Korea: 1.52 **Israel: 1.15** Pakistan: 1.13 **United States: 1.06** 
 
Oh, and look at the US down at 1.06 doses per 100 people per week. Our vaccination velocity is nearly ten times higher!

The required antibody test tests for IgM as opposed to the ""usual"" antibody test that targets IgG. IgM is produced in the early stage of infection and goes down as your body produces IgG to neutralize the virus. A positive IgM indicates there's a chance of active infection in early stage. I think this is an additional layer of security trying to filter out asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic cases in case the viral load is too low for the PCR test to detect.

Things changed again after vaccines rolled out, since a vaccinated traveler may now report positive S protein IgM despite not being infected (especially if they are vaccinated close to departure). This is where the N protein IgM test came in. The mRNA and virus vector vaccines only carries information for body to produce S protein and corresponding antibodies. Therefore, a positive N protein IgM will indicate the person have came into contact with the virus recently. On the other hand, negative N protein IgM indicates the positive S protein IgM is likely the result of vaccine instead of the virus itself.

Also, yes, those got the inactivated virus vaccine can board the flight as long as they can provide the negative PCR test plus proof of vaccination.

Hope this clarify things up for you a bit.

No observation of National Immunization Awareness Month in August. No reminders to the parents of teens who are late in receiving their second COVID-19 vaccine.

https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations

So, a big chunk of their senior citizens are coming up on six months post vaccination. The reason you were hearing talk about senior citizens and people with health complications is because they are the first wave of people to hit the six month mark. I doubt younger people will see such a big drop, but they likely *will* see a drop.

The reason Israel was able to vaccinate such a big chunk of their population so insanely fast was because of the special deal they cut with Pfizer. In exchange for getting early access, they would turn their entire country into an experiment of 10 million people. Pfizer has access to all of their medical data, which they can use to fully assess how their vaccine is doing with time to respond in the rest of the world.

For that reason, I am very confident that Pfizer’s predictions about their own vaccine will come true. There is no better test ground for analysis of their vaccine, and no other place on earth had such early mass adoption.

The UK was fast relative to most other places, but initially they were mostly using the Astra Zeneca shot, which is a different vaccine. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do a good job targeting antibodies, but that is the immune response that subsides fastest for coronaviruses.

I admit this is all just my own opinion. But I think if you set a remind me for this post, it will turn out that that Pfizer vaccines did indeed turn out to become less effective after six months elsewhere, too.

They are also tired of appeasing others. They want to get back to normal, where they are able to exercise free will. 

If you read the quote below, you can no longer claim to ""not get it.""

""You see, gentlemen, reason is an excellent thing, there's no disputing that, but reason is nothing but reason and satisfies only the rational side of man's nature, while will is a manifestation of the whole life, that is, of the whole human life including reason and all the impulses. And although our life, in this manifestation of it, is often worthless, yet it is life and not simply extracting square roots. Here I, for instance, quite naturally want to live, in order to satisfy all my capacities for life, and not simply my capacity for reasoning, that is, not simply one twentieth of my capacity for life. What does reason know? Reason only knows what it has succeeded in learning (some things, perhaps, it will never learn; this is a poor comfort, but why not say so frankly?) and human nature acts as a whole, with everything that is in it, consciously or unconsciously, and, even if it goes wrong, it lives. I suspect, gentlemen, that you are looking at me with compassion; you tell me again that an enlightened and developed man, such, in short, as the future man will be, cannot consciously desire anything disadvantageous to himself, that that can be proved mathematically. I thoroughly agree, it can--by mathematics. But I repeat for the hundredth time, there is one case, one only, when man may consciously, purposely, desire what is injurious to himself, what is stupid, very stupid--simply in order to have the right to desire for himself even what is very stupid and not to be bound by an obligation to desire only what is sensible. Of course, this very stupid thing, this caprice of ours, may be in reality, gentlemen, more advantageous for us than anything else on earth, especially in certain cases. And in particular it may be more advantageous than any advantage even when it does us obvious harm, and contradicts the soundest conclusions of our reason concerning our advantage--for in any circumstances it preserves for us what is most precious and most important--that is, our personality, our individuality. Some, you see, maintain that this really is the most precious thing for mankind; choice can, of course, if it chooses, be in agreement with reason; and especially if this be not abused but kept within bounds. It is profitable and sometimes even praiseworthy. But very often, and even most often, choice is utterly and stubbornly opposed to reason ... and ... and ... do you know that that, too, is profitable, sometimes even praiseworthy? Gentlemen, let us suppose that man is not stupid. (Indeed one cannot refuse to suppose that, if only from the one consideration, that, if man is stupid, then who is wise?) But if he is not stupid, he is monstrously ungrateful! Phenomenally ungrateful. In fact, I believe that the best definition of man is the ungrateful biped. But that is not all, that is not his worst defect; his worst defect is his perpetual moral obliquity, perpetual--from the days of the Flood to the Schleswig-Holstein period. Moral obliquity and consequently lack of good sense; for it has long been accepted that lack of good sense is due to no other cause than moral obliquity. Put it to the test and cast your eyes upon the history of mankind. What will you see? Is it a grand spectacle? Grand, if you like. Take the Colossus of Rhodes, for instance, that's worth something. With good reason Mr. Anaevsky testifies of it that some say that it is the work of man's hands, while others maintain that it has been created by nature herself. Is it many-coloured? May be it is many-coloured, too: if one takes the dress uniforms, military and civilian, of all peoples in all ages--that alone is worth something, and if you take the undress uniforms you will never get to the end of it; no historian would be equal to the job. Is it monotonous? May be it's monotonous too: it's fighting and fighting; they are fighting now, they fought first and they fought last--you will admit, that it is almost too monotonous. In short, one may say anything about the history of the world--anything that might enter the most disordered imagination. The only thing one can't say is that it's rational. The very word sticks in one's throat. And, indeed, this is the odd thing that is continually happening: there are continually turning up in life moral and rational persons, sages and lovers of humanity who make it their object to live all their lives as morally and rationally as possible, to be, so to speak, a light to their neighbours simply in order to show them that it is possible to live morally and rationally in this world. And yet we all know that those very people sooner or later have been false to themselves, playing some queer trick, often a most unseemly one. Now I ask you: what can be expected of man since he is a being endowed with strange qualities? Shower upon him every earthly blessing, drown him in a sea of happiness, so that nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface; give him economic prosperity, such that he should have nothing else to do but sleep, eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation of his species, and even then out of sheer ingratitude, sheer spite, man would play you some nasty trick. He would even risk his cakes and would deliberately desire the most fatal rubbish, the most uneconomical absurdity, simply to introduce into all this positive good sense his fatal fantastic element. It is just his fantastic dreams, his vulgar folly that he will desire to retain, simply in order to prove to himself--as though that were so necessary--that men still are men and not the keys of a piano, which the laws of nature threaten to control so completely that soon one will be able to desire nothing but by the calendar. And that is not all: even if man really were nothing but a piano-key, even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of simple ingratitude, simply to gain his point. And if he does not find means he will contrive destruction and chaos, will contrive sufferings of all sorts, only to gain his point! He will launch a curse upon the world, and as only man can curse (it is his privilege, the primary distinction between him and other animals), may be by his curse alone he will attain his object--that is, convince himself that he is a man and not a piano-key! If you say that all this, too, can be calculated and tabulated--chaos and darkness and curses, so that the mere possibility of calculating it all beforehand would stop it all, and reason would reassert itself, then man would purposely go mad in order to be rid of reason and gain his point! I believe in it, I answer for it, for the whole work of man really seems to consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a piano-key! It may be at the cost of his skin, it may be by cannibalism! And this being so, can one help being tempted to rejoice that it has not yet come off, and that desire still depends on something we don't know?

As someone with a biochemistry degree and who actually took a course in the biochemistry of viruses i can say with pretty good confidence that you can't really predict how virulence is going to change (with a few exceptions)

Attenuation in a host species tends to happen with viruses that are *really* virulent. If the infection kills your ass before it can transmit to another host, the virus has ""failed"" a test of fitness. I'd wager that ebola will become less virulent over time but the time scale for that is highly dependent on how many outbreaks there are/ how many people get infected.

I'm not sure whether they checked with the laboratory *because* the forgery was bad. Not sure if they have the infrastructure to check every test result, but it could have been caught because it was randomly selected for confirmation as well. 

They also reported that they caught 600 other fake test results, so they may be verifying test results from certain labs that are more likely to show up on forged results.

I don't think we can assume that the forgery was bad from appearance alone.

As for private entities they could technically require vaccination to remain employed/become employed by them, but having full approval would make it much more palatable to do so.

That thing said, here the contamination are going up, and going up at a very alarming rate. From there we have a choice to make, because we will have restrictions again there is no other possibilities. So now we have (i mean the government) have 2 choices :
- we close restaurant, cinema, museum etc… for everyone again
- we close only for unvaccinated people

What’s the fairest option ? Closing for everyone mean that those who were vaccinated also get the blame even if they are protected and protect their relatives. Closing for unvaccinated mean technically discriminating against unvaccinated. 

I vaccinated myself voluntary. As well as all my family, because we respected social distancing. I didn’t saw my grandma for a year, even if she live 1h of road afar. We followed the rules, and now we are free so see again (and we had a great meal at restaurant !). This is liberty. My liberty stops where the liberty of others start. 
My liberty is now to go out, to go to restaurant, to see my family. Unvaccinated people are the one to blame if we have a 4th wave. If they close again, this is their fault and not our. By choosing their liberty to not vaccine, they cause restrictions, so they are infringing our liberty. 

You have still have the right to not vaccinate you know. But this come with a cost.

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

1. mRNA is not a protein, nor is it made of proteins. Instead it is a nucleic acid.
2. The mRNA is not itself detected by the immune system to generate antibodies. Instead it enters your cells and is translated into proteins that are displayed on the cell membrane and are detected by the immune system.

Most of the other things you are saying are presented as conjecture and probably shouldn't be trusted given your misunderstanding of basic facts.

Details and References for 1:

It is a type of ribonucleic acid, a strand of ribose (a sugar), phosphate groups, and bases. Whereas proteins are made of folded strands of amino acids. Wikipedia is probably the most accessible intro to basic molecular biology, outside of attending high school biology.

 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA#Structure
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein

Details and Reference for 2:

Instead, the mRNA enters cells, and is translated into proteins that mimic the ""spike"" protein of the coronavirus, which is the part that allows the virus to enter cells. These spike-alike proteins then are placed on the cell membrane of the cell, where the immune system can detect them.

How high it gets and how much the immunity provides a firewall against serious cases are yet to be seen. It won't be as bad as before, but there's a lot of hosts left.

I think there was a lot of overconfidence in the ability of vaccines to prevent another wave, even though we'd seen many highly-vaccinated countries like Chile lose control of it (though it's coming down now). It was sort of dismissed because Chinese vaccines aren't as good as the Western ones. 

But it's not really that surprising when you take into account that vaccines aren't perfect, a lot of adults aren't vaccinated, most children aren't vaccinated, and young people are no longer afraid that they'll land their grandma in the hospital if they go out and party (and they weren't afraid of the virus personally, even before vaccines).

And finally, though we haven't seen many serious reinfections (if the new variants completely overrode infection from the old versions, we'd see it in places that got hit hard more than once), there are still a lot of susceptible people out there, because, believe it or not, no one has ""let it rip"" and we've never seen what it would be like if everyone got it, unmitigated.

&gt; the mRNA technology of PFizer is more targetted, inducing the immune system to recognise a characteristic spike protein of the virus, a ""zoomed in"" view if you like. Pros - allowed for quicker development of a vaccine. Cons: probably less likely to endure than natural immunity, especially in the face of variants

They chose the spike protein because it is likely to be highly conserved through the evolution of variants as it is a requirement to infect a human cell. Not for ""faster development of the vaccine"".

I'm not sure where you got the idea that ""natural immunity"" is ""better"" in the face of the variants, but that sure as hell isn't the data we're seeing.

IIRC OG COVID infection's immunity to delta was like 30-40%, whereas Pfizer two dose was like 80%+.

While the proportion of cases that lead to hospital admissions and deaths is much lower, if you get enough cases it still becomes a concern. Younger people are being hospitalized more than anyone else now, and they're likely to survive, but if cases keep rising it may reach a rate where it puts a lot of pressure on other services. That's bad news if you have a cancer scare, or if you get hit by a car and need an ambulance, or if you've been waiting for a hip replacement but the waiting list got absolutely fucked by successive covid waves.

Once it gets approved for everybody tho and the amount of vaccinations returns to stagnate some time after that (like now), you'll be pretty much done with the people that you'll be able to vaccinate in a useful amount of time. The question then is how many people can be convinced in the hesitant group and how can it happen. That will probably be painfully slow and hard tho, so you will probably see the amount of vaccinated slowly creep up until who knows where.

[],,Odd_Science,,,[],,,,text,t2_1cljtskv,False,False,[],"""95% less likely to have symptomatic infection"" is exactly what you would get if ""the vaccine works 95% of times"". So it could very well be partly this, i.e. some of the breakthroughs are because the vaccine didn't work for some people.

However, this binary ""works 95% of times"" vs. doesn't work at all 5% of the time is not the only way you would get the reduction in infection rate. It could e.g. shift the severeness so some survive instead of dying, some have a mild disease instead of a severe one, some don't get it at all instead of being asymptomatic. This could have essentially the same effect at the population level.

In the case being discussed that would mean hospitalization instead of death if the vaccine's effect is the latter (shifting the curve) or it would mean no change at all vs. unvaccinated if the vaccine simply did not work for them at all.

I would expect a mix of both effects, i.e. the vaccines mostly reduce severeness but for some people they just don't take.

Vaccines are pretty much universally safer than the vast majority of pharmaceuticals you take or buy (over the counter or prescription). The standard for vaccine safety is incredibly high because they are given to healthy people, whereas (presumably) other drugs are taken as a therapeutic or cure to an existing illness. 

While it's a bit of a red herring as acetaminophen (tylenol / paracetamol) would never be approved as over the counter under today's drug approval regime, more than 250 people in the US die painful and excruciating deaths from liver failure each year from unintentional acetaminophen overdoses (and ignores the hundreds of more that would have died without liver transplants). Dozens of other over the counter drugs have serious potentially fatal side effects that kill people each year. 

Birth control is way worse than any vaccine in terms of side effects - both long and short term - and risk of death - either from clots or from increased risk of cancer. But it is ""therapeutic"" in the sense that the risk of death from birth control is *far* less than the risk of death from pregnancy and - obviously - the societal benefits of women having more control of their reproductive decisions.

[],,Synonyms26,,,[],,,,text,t2_10wdsu,False,False,[],"The Health Ministry said it would allow mixing the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine with the one produced by Pfizer/BioNTech should there be limited vaccine supply.  
In a decision issued by deputy minister of health Truong Quoc Cuong on the ministry's distribution plan for the incoming 745,000 Pfizer vaccine doses purchased using the national budget, the ministry said those who have been given their first Covid-19 vaccine shot by AstraZeneca would be prioritized to receive their second shot with the Pfizer vaccine about 8-12 weeks after the first shot.  
  
The decision would only be applicable if the ones to be vaccinated consent to it. For those who have yet to receive any Covid-19 vaccine shot, the Pfizer one would be prioritized for use as well, according to the decision.  
  
While the Pfizer vaccine doses would be distributed to all 63 localities of Vietnam, most of them would end up in HCMC, Hanoi, Binh Duong and Dong Nai, which are either major cities or experiencing severe Covid-19 outbreaks. Binh Duong and Dong Nai Provinces bordering HCMC are among the country's biggest industrial hubs.  
  
HCMC in particular would receive around 55,000 doses, Hanoi 38,000, and the southern Binh Duong and Dong Nai 25,000 each. Most other localities would receive around 5,850 doses each.  
  
Among the 745,000 Pfizer vaccine doses to be received, Vietnam has only received over 97,000 so far. The rest would arrive within this month, though their exact dates have yet to be confirmed.  
  
It is the first time Vietnam allows mixing different types of Covid-19 vaccines through multiple shots, though the decision has already been observed in several countries around the world.  
  
Thailand for example said on Tuesday it would provide its people their third shots of Covid-19 vaccine by AstraZeneca following two shots by China's Sinovac after it recorded coronavirus infections even on fully vaccinated individuals with the Sinovac vaccine.

Vaccine makers started applying for full FDA approval in **May/June**. [A simple search shows as much.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/18/covid-vaccines-what-full-fda-approval-means-for-you.html) 

There is no delay or need for concern.

The vaccines that are available today weren’t all approved for emergency use at the same time. They didn’t all apply at the same time, either. 

&gt; There are two ways to get a vaccine greenlighted by the FDA: with an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or by applying for a license through a Biologics License Application (BLA).

&gt; “The only difference really between the emergency use and the licensure is that volunteers are observed for a longer period of time to see the duration of protection, and if there might be rare adverse events that occurred down the road,"" Dr. Schaffner said. 

&gt; In layman's terms, Dr. Monto said, that follow-up period after complete vaccination is typically longer when considering full licensure.

&gt; ""After the clinical trials are finished, the difference between the Emergency Use Authorization and full licensure, for the public's information or knowledge, is basically the duration of follow-up or safety, not efficacy,"" Dr. Monto said.  ""Efficacy requirements are the same.""

&gt; For the EUA, it's an average of two months, but for a license, six months are required, Dr. Monto explained.

&gt; A spokesperson for the FDA backed that up and said they usually expect manufacturers to provide data from study participants from at least six months after vaccination when applying for a license.

&gt; So, between an EUA and a license, an EUA was the quicker option to get the vaccines out to save lives. Think of it as the fast-tracked version, rather than the standard one.

&gt; EUAs only come into play if the secretary of Health and Human Services deems them necessary, and they're generally temporary, as opposed to licensure.

You’re not going to change the anti-vaxxers minds easily, and in the US, I just don’t see any sort of vaccine passport getting large scale acceptance. And those who can’t get the vaccine for a rational reason are a small group.

I’m not saying we flat out refuse to treat them. But if you’re community has an outbreak and the hospitals fill, and you catch COVID and need a ventilator, but someone else needs that same ventilator who just had a car crash or whatever, too bad for you if you’re unvaccinated.

[],,lilB0bbyTables,,,[],,,,text,t2_5eusi,False,False,[],"There has never been anything to stop these companies from hiring software engineers from outside metropolitan markets or off-shoring before Covid, so why does this suddenly matter now?

In fact companies are paying millions of dollars for office space, then paying the overhead of furnishing those spaces, stocking them, managing them, and the utility bills and insurance policies to cover those locations. 

This entire time they could have saved massive amounts of money by explicitly not having offices in those major cities, but they opened those offices because the idea was that those were the hot places to prop up their businesses to attract talent and business. The cycle was then created that software engineers had to move to those cities to land such jobs. And the housing prices and costs of living rose upward as a consequence of this. It's an ever ballooning race upwards.

One could argue that the salaries of employees are slightly inflated due to costs of living in certain markets, but skills have a value. If you're working for a company at their office in Manhattan or from home in rural/suburban areas shouldn't make a difference - if you have the skills to produce the value the company needs and the company is making the same profit margins and meeting their fiscal plans ... you've earned your value. 

There was a major push to off-shore software engineering jobs in the late 90s and early 00s and suddenly those jobs came pouring back home. Why?

Brief Summary:

This is a Phase 1/2/3, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-finding, vaccine candidate-selection, and efficacy study in healthy individuals.

The study consists of 2 parts: Phase 1: to identify preferred vaccine candidate(s) and dose level(s); Phase 2/3: an expanded cohort and efficacy part.

**The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 3 different SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine candidates against COVID-19 and the efficacy of 1 candidate:**

As a 2-dose (separated by 21 days) schedule;

At various different dose levels in Phase 1;

As a booster;

In 3 age groups (Phase 1: 18 to 55 years of age, 65 to 85 years of age; Phase 2/3: ≥12 years of age [stratified as 12-15, 16-55 or &gt;55 years of age]).

Supply of vegetables and fruits are now being affected by the closing of the city's wholesale markets and many traditional markets, where most of such products are sold and bought.

Demand began spiking before July 9 amid fears of the more intense lockdown under Directive 16 and people were rushing to stock up.

Some market traders began to jack up prices amidst the falling supply initially when the wholesale markets closed, but prices and supply began to stabilise after July 9.

Demand at supermarkets and food stores jumped again on Sunday, July 11, as people who had been unable to shop earlier made use of the weekend to buy in bulk and many other markets were closed, leading to some stores running out of stocks.

Đào Văn Đức, deputy director of the Phước An Co-operative group in HCM City’s Bình Chánh District, said his group was making an effort to keep supplying vegetables and fruits to the market through Co.opMart and Big C retail chains and at quarantine zones.

It also had to pay for COVID-19 testing fees for delivery staff, which were expensive, but it tried to keep vegetable prices steady, he said.

Bùi Tá Hoàng Vũ, director of the city Department of Industry and Trade, said vegetable prices at supermarkets were steady but there was a shortage.

Many large retailers had been increasing supply by up to five times to make up for the closure of many traditional markets, but they were still not enough, he said.

Noticing prices and demand for vegetables are rising, individuals and businesses are trying to help by buying vegetables from other provinces and selling them at below market prices.

Trịnh Thị Ngọc Hiện, head of Anfoods Joint Stock Company in Bến Tre Province, said her company was offering to supply non-leafy vegetables and fruits to seafood buyers at cost prices.

The city Department of Industry and Trade is seeking ways to increase the supply of vegetables and fruits.

Nguyễn Nguyên Phương, its deputy director, said districts were expected to work with closed markets on COVID-19 regulations so that they could reopen.

Many traders at the three wholesale markets are also selling their goods online.

Transhipment station set up at Thủ Đức Wholesale market  
  
Thủ Đức City has set up a transhipment station at the Thủ Đức Wholesale Market container parking lot yesterday (July 12) in an effort to increase supply of vegetables and fruits to the city.  
  
A trial run was carried out on July 11, with six businesses receiving goods.  
  
Shipments of produce from other provinces are transferred to smaller trucks to be transported to supermarkets and businesses’ staff kitchens around HCM City.  
  
Up to 2,000 tonnes of vegetables and fruits will be distributed in this manner every night.  
  
Strict measures are in place in the area, with only registered vehicles being allowed to enter and all personnel required to furnish negative COVID test results from within the last 72 hours.  
  
Goods are to be unloaded and loaded quickly so that the container trucks from outside can leave at the earliest.  
  
The Hóc Môn Wholesale Market is planning to set up a similar transhipment station soon.

It's very easy to imagine scenarios where you take multiple of these. You have a cold/fever so you grab Tylenol for the fever and Sudafed PE for the cold. You also are having period cramps, so you grab some Midol. One of your symptoms is headache for which you always take Excedrin. You frequently have allergies and you're not sure if it's a cold or allergies so you decide to grab some Benadryl that you regularly take as well. And when it's time for bed, you grab the Nyquil in addition to topping off your Midol, Sudafed, and Tylenol. Boom, you're easily at 5X recommended dose depending on how frequently you took them. 

Sounds crazy when written out, but it's very easy to do this, especially at different times during the day as you experience different symptoms.

Vaccine does not prevent deaths, new delta strain is less lethal by nature, simple as that. It is new mutated virus strain,less lethal virus form of covid, which vaccine is not protecting you from.Remember ,not all flu strains had same virulence every year either, but they make new vaccine every year.

Are there increased deaths though?
The current vaccines don't prevent people from being infected or registering as such, but it does prevent the severe sickness and likelihood of death that comes with it.

Especially to [Alpha/Beta.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgxpre/vaccineinduced_immunity_provides_more_robust/) Natual immunity from clearing an infection is highly protective of future infections, but you have to risk the disease in order to get it. 

The OG SARS virus (SARS-CoV-1) from 2003 gave detectable immunity [both 6](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/12/7264) and [12 years later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kvbz9y/weekly_question_thread/gizs32j/)   

Vaccination and previous infection [reduce viral load, which reduces spread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s). Updated info [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ocygyp/vast_majority_of_breakthrough_infections_in/)

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) article does a good job of explaining the likelihood of vaccines *at least* reducing spread.  [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lf744r/daily_discussion_thread_february_08_2021/gml0gyi/) may help too. Data from [Scotland](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m3tx1n/covid19_vaccine_linked_to_a_reduction_in/). 

[""Moderna vaccine blocks &gt;90% (87-93%) of infections &amp; 91% (89-94%) of transmission.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmqfk4q/)

 This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a great reduction in ability to spread the virus. [Maybe even with just one dose!](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242) You should [get both doses though.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m2mtnv/immune_response_to_sarscov2_variants_of_concern/)

Reinfections are rare, some studies show [less than 1 in 1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kyj0bx/sarscov2_reinfection_in_a_cohort_of_43000/) (maybe in the 1 in 10,000 range, you'll have to read the study, it's awesome).  Reinfections tend to be much milder than previous infections, even those new variants. Check the [comments here](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lm0mc2/prior_covid19_significantly_reduces_the_risk_of/) for some really interesting discussion regarding reinfection. Especially the top comment thread.

[Delayed second doses are fine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/layx6g/single_dose_administration_and_the_influence_of/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) At least with [ChAdOx1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), though there is evidence from the mRNA vaccine trials that suggest that up to 6 weeks is better if not at least acceptable. The problem is that you have to wait longer for the second dose, and therefore, full protection. [CDC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lbiqne/daily_discussion_thread_february_03_2021/glvp1nl?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) used to say that there is no maximum interval between doses, but has recently changed. [Pfizer says not more than 6 weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/liakcb/covid19_vaccine_doses_shouldnt_be_more_than_six/). 

[Dose intervals might increase efficacy if extended past 3 or 4 weeks,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/mudvjd/questin_about_vaccine_intervals/gv58byt/) CDC says you have up to 42 days between doses (but that may be extended at some point).

Did you accidentally get mixed doses? [All good.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html)

Even if your antibodies fade over time, [you still have immunity.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/npeymo/sarscov2specific_memory_b_cells_can_persist_in/)

1. Parents that do not ensure their kids are enrolled in and attend school of some kind are breaking the law and can actually have the cops come after them.

2. The Texas governor has banned mask mandates and any requirements for schools and other government buildings putting limitations on people in order to prevent COVID (e.g. they can't ban recess or P.E. in enclosed areas or do social distancing as well if it's to fight COVID.)

3. Kids under 12 will not be able to be vaccinated until after the school year starts.  The last I heard, Pfizer was going to seek permission to vaccinate kids under 12 potentially in September, and optimistically we'd probably be looking at October at the earliest for the first batch of kids to be able to have immunity.

4. A lot of parents in our communities are anti-mask and anti-vaccine, and complain loudly any time the school district does something to try to keep kids safer.  The result is that no school district is going to stick their necks out to fight back against the state government in the face of these foaming at the mouth anti-vaxxers.

My kids are wearing masks and taking the same precautions we took prior to my wife and I being vaccinated and that will end when they are vaccinated.  So my choices are basically a) pull them out of school and homeschool them where they're going to fall behind because we can't act as surrogate teachers, or b) send them to in-person classes where they'll get a better education but will be at risk for COVID until they can be vaccinated.  There's no good option frankly, and if it weren't for the Delta variant I don't think there would be a lot of hand-wringing over masks.  

As for the risks, I think focusing only on death from COVID is a huge mistake, since there are [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7927578/) that say the risk of long COVID symptoms is about 50% (although to be fair, I've seen other studies as low as 20% and 40%.)

Really hope they can get the kids vaccines authorized in the next month or two, but it’s not looking great.

Of the people I know who got COVID none panicked about it and none was talking about it afterwards unless relevant to the conversation.

In my perception the percentage of the people who are against vaccines in general or wary of COVID vaccines specifically isn't high. If you read comments on some Russian news site regarding COVID you will find such people, they usually either mistrust Russian-made vaccines (because ""the industry is in shambles, so they couldn't have made anything decent"") and wait for approval of a Western vaccine (Chinese-made are mistrusted too), or mistrust all COVID vaccines due to the speed of development and lack of long-term testing, finding them in real-life is more difficult.

You clearly want to believe a certain narrative. The CDC said this on February 12, 2020:

&gt;CDC does not currently recommend the use of face masks for the general public.  This virus is not spreading in the community.  If you are sick or a patient under investigation and not hospitalized, CDC recommends wearing a face mask when around other people and before entering a health care provider’s office, but when you are alone, in your home, you do not need to wear a mask.  People who are in close contact with someone with novel coronavirus, for example, household contacts and care givers of people with known or suspected 2019, I’m sorry, nCoV 2019, we should wear a face mask if they are in the same room as the patient and that patient is not able to wear a face mask.  Health care personnel should wear PPE including respirators when caring for confirmed or possible nCoV patients because they’re in direct contact with those patients which increases their risk of exposure. 

Want to guess how many new cases there were in the US on that day? Zero. It was also clearly not suspected of being airborne. If you worked for the CDC back then, you would have made the same call.

“The researchers found elevations of C5b9 in pediatric patients with severe COVID-19 and MIS-C, but to their surprise, they also found that C5b9 was elevated in patients with minimal or asymptomatic disease. Of the 22 patients for whom complete data were available, 19 (86%) met the criteria for TMA \[thrombotic microangiopathy\]. Additionally, sC5b9 levels were elevated both in patients who did and did not meet criteria for TMA. Although most children with COVID-19 do not have severe disease, our study shows that there may be other effects of SARS-CoV-2 that are worthy of investigation.”

“Methods: We retrospectively investigated patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 but who did not show any symptoms. Among the 139 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Yeungnam University Hopistal in Daegu, South Korea, 10 (7.2%) were asymptomatic. Their chest CT and radiographic findings were analyzed. Results: In the results, all patients (100%) had ground-glass opacity (GGO) on chest CT. Further, the GGO lesions were predominantly distributed peripherally and posteriorly in all patients. In 9 (90%) patients, the GGO lesions were combined with reticular opacity.”

This study (including a control group with n\~5000) may be an interesting read. Mild-moderate acute stage. 15% reported moderate to severe symptoms &gt;8 months post infection.  
  
Comparing seropositive vs seronegative participants, 26% vs 9% reported at least 1 moderate to severe symptom lasting for at least 2 months (RR, 2.9 \[95% CI, 2.2-3.8\]) and 15% vs 3% reported at least 1 moderate to severe symptom lasting for at least 8 months (RR, 4.4 \[95% CI, 2.9-6.7\]) (Table).

Knowing that they prevent at the bare minimum the majority of infections (could change as antibodies wane, but even the most pessimistic current reports have them at 64% efficacy for preventing infection), and in the case of breakthroughs they elicit immune responses that clear the virus quicker (which means less chance to pervade and damage systems) and keep the viral load lower (less virus to to pervade and damage systems).

Couple that with the fact that yes, those things can happen with asymptomatic/mild cases, but not as likely as with severe cases (I don’t have numbers to cite but given the massive amount of people who have recovered fine I think it’s a fair general assertion), then I think it’s pretty reasonable to assume that it’s POSSIBLE for vaccinated asymptomatic cases to have such long-term complications, but just as reasonable to assume that they would be significantly reduced.

Even if it's only 1/5th the number of cases for older people than it would be without vaccines, if the spread  and case numbers go up more than 5X, you get more deaths from that group than if there were no vaccines but lower case rates. 

There's also some evidence that older people are more likely to get breakthrough cases and deaths from those breakthrough cases (I assume because their immune systems are not as strong), so there's that, too.

&gt; The average number of new daily COVID-19 cases has increased 94 percent over the past two weeks, according to data from The New York Times, as worries over outbreaks climb nationwide.

&gt; The U.S. recorded a seven-day average of more than 23,000 daily cases on Monday, almost doubling from the average two weeks ago, as less than half of the total population is fully vaccinated.

&gt; Monday’s count of 32,105 newly confirmed cases pushed the seven-day average up from its Sunday level of more than 19,000 new cases — a 60 percent increase from two weeks prior.

&gt; All but four states — West Virginia, Maine, South Dakota and Iowa — have seen increased daily averages in the past 14 days, and the average in 16 states at least doubled in that period.

&gt; This comes as the highly transmissible delta variant was declared the dominant strain in the U.S. last week.

&gt; At the same time, vaccinations have stalled with the daily rate reaching its lowest point during President Biden’s tenure on Sunday at slightly more than 506,000. Monday saw a small uptick in the average rate to more than 527,000 per day, according to Our World in Data.

&gt; The rise in case counts come as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says just 48 percent of the total population is fully vaccinated. Officials have said fully vaccinated people are protected from the virus, while unvaccinated people are at much higher risk for serious illness and death. 

&gt; This leaves a majority of Americans still vulnerable to the virus, in particular children under 12 years old who are not authorized to get the vaccine. Out of the eligible population aged 12 and older, 56.2 percent are fully vaccinated. 

&gt; The Biden administration has strived to boost vaccination numbers over the past few months and signaled a new strategy focused on grassroots campaigning to promote the vaccine last week.

[],,Worms_sg,,,[],,,,text,t2_9wimhx4b,False,False,[],"KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia reported 11,079 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday (July 13), the first time daily infections have hit five figures, amid a health crisis that has seen hospitals and Covid-19 assessment centres flooded with patients.

The previous daily record was logged just three days ago on Saturday, with 9,353 cases. Tuesday also saw 125 deaths and a record 972 patients in intensive care.

Selangor, the country’s most populous state, reported the bulk of the new infections with 5,263 cases, or 47.5 per cent of the total.

The federal territory of Kuala Lumpur, which is surrounded by the state of Selangor, logged 1,521 infections, the second highest in the country.

At 855,949 cases overall, Malaysia has one of South-east Asia’s highest per-capita infection rates.

One of the reasons for the rise is the emergence of the Delta variant which can spread via airborne transmission, said Health director-general Noor Hisham Abdullah.

“We were informed that the Delta variant is now the dominant variant,” he told a news conference.

The number of infections is projected to further increase in the next two weeks before stabilising, he added.

There are concerns about the rising number of cases, deaths and patients in hospitals, even as large chunks of Malaysia including Selangor and KL are into its seventh week of total lockdown, and with the government boasting that a high number of people have been inoculated.

Nearly 11.8 million Malaysians have received at least one dose of the vaccine by Monday, or about 24.8 per cent of the population, said Health Minister Adham Baba. They included 11.3 per cent (3.68 million) who have received the full dosage.

Social media has been awash with video clips and pictures of bodies piling up in hospitals.

A viral 15-minute video uploaded on YouTube on Monday purportedly had distressed frontliners comparing the healthcare system in the Klang Valley - Malaysia’s most populated districts comprising KL, Putrajaya and most of Selangor - to a sunken ship.

“We are replacing oxygen canisters by the hour. Some patients might be required to share oxygen with five other patients,” said an unnamed frontliner.

There is also a shortage in medications used for the past few weeks, said another frontliner. “We are not receiving help from the headquarters and we are dying in this battle,” she said.

No images of the frontliners were shown and their voices appeared to have been altered to protect their identities, as there is a gag order against health workers making unauthorised comments.

Meanwhile, a vaccination centre in the Selangor capital of Shah Alam was shut down for a day on Tuesday after 204 workers tested positive for Covid-19, following a mass screening exercise on all 453 workers and volunteers.

Those who tested positive have been isolated and a new team of workers will man the Ideal Convention Centre on Wednesday after the centre is sanitised, officials said.

The government has been on the defensive as the caseloads have continued to climb six months into a state of emergency that was imposed in mid-January with the stated aim of taming the disease.

Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin on Tuesday visited a key Selangor hospital which is struggling with the influx of patients, and said help is on the way for the Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital in Klang town.

He said  an additional RM100 million (S$32 million) would be spent on outsourcing healthcare in the Klang Valley, while an additional 151 beds would be added to the hospital along with another 15 ventilators.

“I have ordered (the authorities) to look into the mental health of (frontliners) and the people and ensure that the welfare and morale of health workers are taken care of,” he said, as quoted as saying by Astro Awani news channel.

For patients who have tested positive, their nightmare does not end there.

They have to queue up at Covid-19 assessment centres, or CACs, for authorities to determine whether they will be sent to hospitals, quarantine and treatment centres, or undergo quarantine at home.

On Monday, more than 4,000 Covid-19 patients flocked to the Malawati Stadium, one of Selangor’s biggest CACs.

Photos and video clips of people of all ages, including infants in strollers, queuing on public roads while waiting for their turn to be assessed by medical personnel raised both alarm and anger.

A Covid-19 patient who underwent an assessment at Malawati Stadium last week (July 6) told The Straits Times that it took  six hours to complete the process.

“They told me there were 2,000 people there that day. I arrived at 10.30am, and finished at 4.30pm. It was not as crazy as it is now,” said the patient, who declined to be named.

Meanwhile, residents in Klang town have protested against the location of a CAC in the housing estate of Taman Sri Andalas, which they say is too close to their landed homes.

In the YouTube video, a frontliner compared Malaysia’s health crisis to the outbreak in Italy last year and India this year. “We are already in Italy 2020. We are already in India 2021,” she said.

“If you think the ship is still sailing, I think it has sunk,” said another frontliner.",,,,1626201302,{},h52dl6t,True,t3_ojltdi,False,False,t3_ojltdi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ojltdi/malaysia_logs_new_high_of_11079_covid19_cases/h52dl6t/,1626365621,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;Compared to non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, the adjusted elevation in risk associated with N501Y-positive variants was 59% (49-69%) for hospitalization; 105% (82-134%) for ICU admission; and 61% (40-87%) for death. **Increases with Delta variant were more pronounced: 120% (93-153%) for hospitalization; 287% (198-399%) for ICU admission; and 137% (50-230%) for death.**

In summary, we show that the Delta VOC in Scotland was found mainly in younger, more affluent groups. **Risk of COVID-19 hospital admission was approximately doubled in those with the Delta VOC when compared to the Alpha VOC**

There's three studies showing that Delta is more dangerous than previous variants.

So, a little more than 1/5th are not.

Even if it's only 1/5th the number of cases for older people than it would be without vaccines, if the spread and case numbers go up more than 5X, you get more deaths from that group than if there were no vaccines but lower case rates.

There's also some evidence that older people are more likely to get breakthrough cases and deaths from those breakthrough cases (I assume because their immune systems are not as strong), so there's that, too.

Moreover, there is some evidence that Delta is rougher on younger people than the older variants. 

Finally, for the fall/winter surge, most cases were skewing younger and we still ended up with lots of deaths and hospitalizations (despite some questioning if we would due to the age being yonger).

I'm sure if cases go up, hospitalizations and deaths will go up by some amount.  But the question is how much?

And the vaccination rates are MUCH higher for those 65+ than those under 30.

JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – With a surge in COVID-19 cases due to the Delta variant in Mississippi, health officials are encouraging people to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
In a tweet on Tuesday, State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said there are 12 children in the ICU due to the Delta variant. Ten of them are on life support.

According to Dobbs, a majority of the COVID-19 cases in Mississippi are the Delta variant. He said a “vast majority” of the cases, hospitalizations and deaths are of people who have not been vaccinated.

On Tuesday, the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) reported 219 new coronavirus cases and 10 additional deaths across the state.

Last week, MSDH issued new public health guidance due to the increase in COVID-19 cases. The agency issued the following recommendations:
* Those 65 and older should avoid all indoor mass gatherings (regardless of vaccination status)
* All Mississippi residents with chronic underlying medical conditions avoid all indoor mass gatherings
* All Mississippians 12 years of age and older receive COVID vaccination

&gt; 
&gt; 

Myocarditis is extremely rare (and can happen with any vaccine), far rarer than the instances of MIS-C being found in children from the Delta variant.

&gt; non vaccinated people DO NOT PUT YOU AT RISK.

That is not the point, as mentioned numerous times above. I feel safe, I'm just fine, but it isn't about me. It's about children, the people who legitimately can't vaccinate (who are a very small number), and the healthcare system and the long-term cost of taking care of idiots who refuse to get vaccinated, catch COVID and have to deal with its effects.

&gt; let others decide if they want to or not.

**Other people have the choice.** They may possibly see their movement or admission to events etc limited based upon that choice **that they made.** Nobody is saying that vaccines should be legally mandatory, but people need to take appropriate public health measures if they want to be involved in regular society.

That may mean being shut out of restaurants etc, it may mean having their travel to other countries/regions limited because they can spread the virus, it may mean their employer making it mandatory for them to get vaccinated because otherwise they are endangering those around them (health care workers for example).

If they don't like it: tough shit. Get vaccinated. It's easy and free.

Given all of this, I think you can make a case to say the majority of people in hospital will have been vaccinated. But, no one is sure how many people go into hospital for a completely unrelated illness and contract the virus while in there and are recorded as 'hospitalised with covid': let's just say the general consensus is that since the pandemic began the numbers involved have been significant.

Would you expect anything different? Younger people were not being hospitalised or losing their lives in significant numbers, nowhere near comparable to older age groups, without a vaccine; and it has never been claimed that a vaccine can save all of those people in older age groups contracting the virus.

The point of the vaccine is to limit the damage among those more at risk of being seriously ill.

Aren't all mustelids (weasels, minks, etc) readily infected? Felines as well but they don't seem to transmit easily so maybe low viral load (poor receptor recognition). But mink farms had major outbreaks and clear animal to animal spread. Seems like it could have plenty of natural originating animal hosts. 

I'm a PhD scientist in the biological sciences and previously did research in laboratory evolution and work generally with microbial genetics (mostly applied research genetically engineering them, been doing this for 14 years) and I BLASTed every coding sequence in the viral genome early on after some weird preprint came out claiming there were small bits of HIV amino acid sequences in it (this was extremely spurious and the article failed peer review for many reasons) and there was nothing there. It most closely matched, in every gene, a particular natural bat coronavirus, but was also clearly evolutionarily distant from anything deposited and the genes were so scrambled that it was impossible it was engineered at least from any public database. Simply would be too sophisticated for any human to have done it. It looked completely natural to me. When people genetically engineer things, we lop out chunks of one sequence and substitute in others that are well characterized pieces from something else. There is none of that with SARS-CoV-2, period. Humans can't edit thousands upon thousands of individual bases and do anything intelligent like that. It is definitely 100% natural.

“The researchers found elevations of C5b9 in pediatric  patients with severe COVID-19 and MIS-C, but to their surprise, they also found that C5b9 was elevated in patients with minimal or asymptomatic disease. Of the 22 patients for whom complete data were available, 19 (86%) met the criteria for TMA [thrombotic microangiopathy]. Additionally, sC5b9 levels were elevated both in patients who did and did not meet criteria for TMA. Although most children with COVID-19 do not have severe disease, our study shows that there may be other effects of SARS-CoV-2 that are worthy of investigation.”

“Methods: We retrospectively investigated patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 but who did not show any symptoms. Among the 139 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Yeungnam University Hopistal in Daegu, South Korea, 10 (7.2%) were asymptomatic. Their chest CT and radiographic findings were analyzed. Results: In the results, all patients (100%) had ground-glass opacity (GGO) on chest CT. Further, the GGO lesions were predominantly distributed peripherally and posteriorly in all patients. In 9 (90%) patients, the GGO lesions were combined with reticular opacity.”

This study (including a control group with n~5000) may be an interesting read. Mild-moderate acute stage. 15% reported moderate to severe symptoms &gt;8 months post infection.

Comparing seropositive vs seronegative participants, 26% vs 9% reported at least 1 moderate to severe symptom lasting for at least 2 months (RR, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.2-3.8]) and 15% vs 3% reported at least 1 moderate to severe symptom lasting for at least 8 months (RR, 4.4 [95% CI, 2.9-6.7]) (Table). The most common moderate to severe symptoms lasting for at least 2 months in the seropositive group were anosmia, fatigue, ageusia, and dyspnea.

On the Quebec side is the city of Gatineau, which is smaller (~290,000 people vs. Ottawa's ~1,000,000); together they constitute what is administratively known as the National Capital Region, and it is common for people to live on one side and work on the other, to say nothing of going back and forth for all sorts of other reasons.

Earlier this spring, there was a period in which Gatineau (reflecting Quebec's restrictions) was largely open but with only mid-level precautions; non-essential businesses were open for browsing, restaurants were allowing outdoor dining, schools were at normal in-person capacity, movie theatres and other stuff were all fine. There were still mask and distancing requirements, but you could do most things within reason. Meanwhile, less than 60 seconds away across the bridge, in Ottawa itself you could do virtually nothing. Schools closed, restaurants closed, non-essential businesses closed, non-essential *purchases* at supermarkets and grocery stores prohibited (so like whole aisles taped off, etc.), playing sports at parks prohibited, restrictions on even just fucking *walking around in public* for a while. I don't go over there much at the moment, but my understanding is that although they are gradually opening up again, Ontarians still aren't even allowed to go to a barber shop. Meanwhile, here in Gatineau, we've since lifted up through two more tiers of reopenings and are basically functioning normally apart from mask provisions. We've also reported 52 new cases today in a province of 8.5 million.

Vaccines are less effective with Delta when it comes to mild or asymptomatic cases -

Canada studies show 88% protection against symptomatic infection - https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.28.21259420v1

Scotland has shown 79% against infection - https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01358-1/fulltext

Israel shows 64-70% against infection - https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-is-less-effective-against-delta-variant-israeli-data-show-11625572796

Singapore shows 69% against infection.

So we land somewhere between 64% and 88%, likely somewhere in the middle. 

Some of the best studies come from Singaporean contact tracers.  Singapore has high vaccination rates with mRNA and they’re still seeing tons of asymptomatic spread even via fully-vaccinated individuals:   https://twitter.com/michaelzlin/status/1409707511519748102?s=21

We aren't tracing/tracking those infections in the US so we truly don't know how much of our spread is via vaccinated individuals. The CDC says not to test a vaccinated individual unless they are symptomatic, which means we are likely missing a lot of cases. ",,,,1626147693,{},h4zzsdi,False,t3_oim1lv,False,False,t1_h4zqb8l,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oim1lv/daily_discussion_thread_july_12_2021/h4zzsdi/,1626319040,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I don't know what percentage of the population we need vaccinated to reach ""herd immunjty"" (the point where outbreaks stop due to the percentage of vaccinated being high enough) but I don't think any country has reached it yet.

The EU issues recommendations on what border policies to apply, but most countries put their on twist on them. Even the country color coding scheme based on infections rates developed by the European CDC isn't adopted universally.

Vaccine purchases and approval was also done as a joint effort, with each country being allotted a share based on population size. But rollout details were again left up to the countries themselves. Things like prioritization and interval between doses are different in different countries.

Almost all of the covid-19 measures, lockdowns, school closures, mask policies, curfews, were decided at the country level, with the EU having no role in the process.

However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

By no means a guarantee, of course.

And regarding your other comment on eyes, it's an interesting question. I haven't seen any good data on how often infections are initiated in the eye vs the throat (it would likely require a study testing both tissues for SARS\_nCoV\_2 regularly to see if it shows up in one first more often than the other or even reliably in both together, if anyone has seen such data I'd love to know), but unless every exposure that results in an infection always infects the eyes as well as the nose/throat, then N95 mask will still decrease your risk by helping to block the situations where just the nose/throat would have been initially infected. Though we don't have that data to my knowledge, I would hypothesize it is the case that a significant portion of infections start in the nose/throat without infecting the eye initially (aka: preventable by an N95) because as a matter of living we constantly suck in air over those regions, whereas the eye does not. Is it worthwhile for you to wear an N95 in higher risk situations once fully vaccinated?

We've gotten better with warning labels, but it is frighteningly easy to overdose on acetaminophen. Many, many drugs have it in it and it doesn't take *that* much extra to cause serious problems, especially if you happen to be on the lower end of the LD50 curve. And the issue is it doesn't cause immediate issues: it damages your liver which can take multiple days to manifest. 

Many people over-consume over the counter drugs under the assumption they are safe and that more is better. And usually that's pretty true. You can take 30 sudafeds in a day (instead of 8) and you may get some heart palpitations, but it won't kill you. If you take 30 tylenols (instead of 8) in a day - especially more than one day in a row - you will end up in the hospital with acute liver failure. 

While some are intentional overdoses, there are over 25,000 hospitalizations from acetaminophen overdoses each year. If caught early enough and the overdose isn't too severe, we can typically save the liver with treatments. But for many, by the time they get to the hospital it is too late: they either get a liver transplant or they die within a week or two.",,,,1626188367,{},h51k9zu,False,t3_oje0ka,False,False,t1_h51i919,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oje0ka/fauci_says_he_would_be_astounded_if_pfizer/h51k9zu/,1626348536,42,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

(Cant get much better for under 20, vaccine or not) Also if things were to ever go bad, you are living in first world country and currently its not covid season so there will be health professionals having time on their hands they can invest in you.

Just read the data and worry not please.

Here is some data sheet from UK to ease up your sleep. Get a lot of sun, eat healthy and have a nice day.

The deaths numbers reflect the sum of many probability waves. When a person gets COVID, they have a chance to die. However, more accurately, they have a particular chance to die on any day for the X number of days. There is a certain day where they have the highest chance to die, but they continue to have less and less chance to die every day after that.  

Let's say you have a million people get infected on January 1, and then nobody gets infected until February, where 100 people get infected each day.  

The deaths graph will still be dominated by the January 1 infections, and there will continue to be less and less deaths every day, since there is less and less people that are expected to die from the January 1 infections with each passing day.   
The actual February infections just aren't a significant contributor to the February deaths, and won't be until basically almost all of the January infections have been resolved.  

That explanation applies to why we didn't see a 33% increase in deaths during the period in the US in March/April.

It's not like data is completely absent - small scale studies are still better than nothing.  So far, it seems that mixing &amp; matching leads to higher antibodies or w/e.  Do we have 5 sigma confidence it's a good thing? that it's safe &amp; won't lead to autoimmune issues? Doesn't seem like we're there yet.

We do have data on previous vaccines (I'm not aware of any where mixing &amp; matching was bad).  We do know the danger of covid running rampant.  Many governments are supply limited, so it's not unreasonable for them to gamble on the mix &amp; match strategy (like Britain gambled on the ""more 1st shots"" rather than the standard ""more fully vaccinated"").  I'm not qualified to say whether that's a good or bad idea, but it does seem that the WHO is a bit on the paranoid side.
