You know what else reduces cases? Country wide lockdown. It is almost as we need to consider the pros and cons to see if the case reduction are worth it.

Actually, nothing I said is ever my opinion. I am just paraphrasing a Epidemiologist who made the argument that we would end up in exactly the same situation 6 months later.

[],,blorg,,,,,,[],"Traditional (defined benefit) pensions are very rare now outside of public service, throughout the developed world. This isn't a US-specific thing. These started to be phased out everywhere in the 1970s and 1980s. I don't know anyone outside of public service who has a defined benefit pension.

* Defined contribution = you make contributions, they get invested in the market, you get whatever that ends up at when you retire. You don't know and it isn't guaranteed what that is, but if the market does well you can come out great. Risk is on the retiree.
* Defined benefit = you get X defined benefit when you retire, whatever happens. This isn't directly connected to the performance of your invested contributions, whatever happens you get X benefits on retirement. Risk is on the pension issuer.

Traditional pensions have been the latter, where people get a fixed sum on retirement, often based on their terminal earnings. But this is very uncommon today.

This has been massively scaled back in the US even for government employees, but they do still have a ""Basic Benefit Plan"" which is a basic level of defined benefit (lower than before).

It's this defined benefit pension I think he's referring to as ""pension""- because TSA are government employees, they get this special type of pension most private sector employees don't get.

But this isn't just the US. The vast, vast majority of non-government employees in any other developed country do not have defined benefit pensions from their employer, this just isn't a thing any more. Defined contribution has been the norm in Australia for example since the introduction of superannuation in 1983, and superannuation in Australia is now overwhelmingly defined contribution.

US Social Security (the ""state pension"" equivalent) is not particularly low compared with other developed countries. It's around double the UK pension, it's also higher than the Australia Age pension (which is one of the highest outside the US).

&gt;The average Social Security retiree benefit recipient will see a monthly payment of $1,657 next year versus $1,565 in 2021, an increase of $92 per month. The maximum benefit for a worker retiring at ""full retirement age"" will rise by $197 a month to $3,345 from $3,148.

* 2021 = $18,780
* 2022 = $19,884

Australia Age Pension:

* A$22,575 (single) = $16,691
* A$17,017 (couple) = $12,581

UK pension:

&gt;The full basic State Pension is ¬£137.60 per week.

* ¬£7,155/year = $9,789

One key issue with US social security though is it is linked to your actual prior earnings and contributions, so not everyone gets the same, people who earned more and contributed more get more. But the average worker does well out of Social Security, compared to other Anglophone developed countries.

On top of this about half of Americans have a private pension (an IRA or 401(k)). This is similar to a superannuation account in Australia, but it's not compulsory.

The system in the US certainly isn't ideal, and there are major problems and many older people have it tough. But this is the case across many other developed countries as well; in fact if we JUST look at the situation of retirees in the US, they probably do pretty well by developed country standards. Bear in mind as well that the US DOES have universal healthcare for over-65s (Medicare).",,,,1634195254,{},hgl2etk,False,t3_q7lnqv,False,False,t1_hgkupgi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q7lnqv/tsa_says_40_of_employees_are_unvaccinated_as/hgl2etk/,1634325645.0,77,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_1vtw,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Private sector workers basically do not get pensions today as a general rule especially for new workers (there are still private workers who were in a plan decades ago and still are today). But today if you sign up for a job and there‚Äôs a pension benefit, I‚Äôd bet you 50:1 it‚Äôs a government job.

Private employees do get Social Security which is a government plan. Benefits range from (I‚Äôm hazarding here) maybe $600/mo to $3900/mo depending on how much you contributed and when you retired.

Many private sector workers also have access to a 401k plan which allows one to save up to $19,500 per year tax deferred in some kinds of plans but up to $57,000 or even $63,000 per year in other types of plans and depending on whether you engage in certain Roth IRA related loopholes. All funded from employee contributions and sometimes employer matching contributions.

These accounts are all personal accounts and not aggregated accounts: your account is *your account* unlike pension funds. These accounts have market risk, but you not pension fund demographic risk which is causing problems for private pensions now and might ultimately doom our social security program too.

So while US private sector workers don‚Äôt ‚Äúget a pension‚Äù our IRA programs are fairly robust substitutes if you have access to them through an employer and have the financial ability and discipline to regularly contribute.",,,,1634192059,{},hgkyfto,False,t3_q7lnqv,False,False,t1_hgkw6kg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q7lnqv/tsa_says_40_of_employees_are_unvaccinated_as/hgkyfto/,1634323415.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_cq7m75v,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I‚Äôm just an average sized white dude with dark hair, a beard, and a resting scowl-face. 

I usually just try to be extra polite and cooperative so I don‚Äôt screw things up for my whole family, but the first time we did holiday travel with our kids the security line was (predictably) slammed.  I had my 2 year-old in a harness on my chest and was wheeling both carry-on bags so my wife could hold my oldest son‚Äôs hand in a busy airport.  I was stressed.  Ever tried taking off your belt and shoes with a toddler strapped to your chest?  It takes a few minutes.  This TSA agent was verbally badgering me like, ‚ÄúSir!  You need to keep it moving.  Hurry it up!‚Äù  After the third time he shouted at me when I was crouched and pulling off my shoe I just paused for a moment and looked him square in the eyes.  I didn‚Äôt say a word.  I didn‚Äôt make a face or a gesture.  Just a deadpan stare-down that lasted about 4 seconds.

They swabbed my hands and forearms (I‚Äôm assuming for GSR?) and made me take some sort of half-assed field sobriety test.  Then they walked me over to all of our bags and made me stand there while they unpacked every single item in our toddler‚Äôs diaper bag.  We had enough diapers for a week along with all his toiletries.  They visually checked each diaper and the associated toiletries individually and left everything in a messy pile on the metal table.

‚ÄúHave a safe flight.‚Äù

We had to get everyone dressed, pack all our shit back up, re-harness our toddler, and sprint to our terminal.  We barely made our flight.  Not one TSA agent or airport staff lifted a finger to help a couple clearly struggling to travel with two small kids.

[],,The_JSQuareD,,,,,,,"Retirement savings in the US are complicated. There's basically 4 ways to fund it:

 - Social security. Almost everyone who works is required by law to contribute to it. And if you do, you build up some retirement benefit (and also a disability benefit). Employers pay into it too. It is redistributional in the sense that if you have a lower income and therefore lower contributions, you get more bang for your buck.
 - Tax advantages savings accounts, like 401(k), 403(b), IRA and Roth. These are savings or investment accounts where you and perhaps your employer pay into it, it grows with the market, and then you use it for retirement, all while paying less tax than om normal earnings and investments. You have a lot of control over this money, and in some circumstances you can even withdraw it early. These are also known as a defined contribution retirement plan, because the contributions are clearly defined, but the payouts in retirement are not (because they depend on how well the market does and when you withdraw the money). 
 - Employer sponsored retirement plans where your contributions give you some right to a future pension payout. These are known as defined benefit retirement plans, and it's what most people mean when they say 'pension'. These used to be more common, but are now mostly found in government jobs and jobs with strong unions. 
 - Just saving money in a normal retirement or investment account. 

When people say that working for TSA gives you a pension, they mean that you get access to a defined benefit retirement plan. Specifically, the defined benefit plan that's part of the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS).

In most jobs you'll have access to social security (in fact, you're required to take part) and to a 401(k).",,,,1634201094,{},hgl8v1m,False,t3_q7lnqv,False,True,t1_hgkupgi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q7lnqv/tsa_says_40_of_employees_are_unvaccinated_as/hgl8v1m/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_tvljp,False,False,False,d48769f6082fdd8707736586f62e7cd668c879f4,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1634201107.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

There is an awful lot of strict true/false in your post. Unfortunately that is not how the world works. 

We are practicing ""virus security"" here, and anyone familiar with security knows it works in layers. One might expect the tsa to be familiar with the concept.

Vaccines work best when they are widely deployed, because doing so reduces transmission (still possible, but reduced with vaccine) and in turn reduce the occurrence of new variants.   We need as many people as possible vaccinated both for those reasons, and because currently not everyone can be, in particular children but also a small percentage who have actual cause cause to not get vaccinated. Aside from this, we as humans should have an interest in not seeing our neighbors get sick or die. 

On to the death rate. First, death is not the only bad outcome from covid and rates of other symptoms from patients are far higher than a focus on the death rate would suggest. Long term disabilities are a possibility, and more short term effects are quite common. One study among health workers found 10% had symptoms impacting work or quality of life *8 months* later.
All that aside, it's a numbers game, and not getting vaccinated against a dangerous virus with potential for long term disability out of fear of vaccine symptoms is like not not wearing a seat belt for fear of pinching your finger in the clasp. 

Both ""if the vaccine is so effective who cares"" and ""well not that many have died"" are crap arguments. I don't want to be sick, I don't want my kids sick, I don't want my neighbors sick, and I don't want you sick. 

Get the shot.

1. There had been a lot of news reporting on every issue with western vaccines. ""1 person died after getting vaccinated with Pfizer"", ""30 in emergency care after astrazeneca jabs"", etc. Only once I read about a person dying after a sputnik shot. So there's not a general government antivax propaganda, mostly just trying to paint other countries in a bad light. 

2. People don't trust the government in general (yet there's still nothing happening against it, on the other hand, it seems nothing can be done anymore - see Khabarovsk or Belarus huge rallies - unfortunately ended in nothing). 

3. Government implementing shitty measures early in the pandemic, reducing trust in newer methods even further.

4. A lot of fakes and general idiocy among the population.

And government jobs (like TSA, CIA, NSA, FBI, US parks). Very few private companies remaining in the US offer pensions.

It is still important to engage with the facts, even if they are inconvenient. We all WISH that the vaccine could eradicate Covid, but it us simply true that animal reservoirs, the more transmissible Delta variant, and transmission from vaccinated people will keep it going, and that‚Äôs not even including the possibilities of new, more resistant strains in future. Measles vax is perhaps a bad example because it is so unusually effective that it produces (arguable) ‚Äòsterilizing immunity‚Äô meaning you cannot transmit (the normally also unusually crazy transmissible)measles if you are vaccinated.  The Covid vaccines reduce transmission, but, depending on the study/type, only about 65%. So, you can still easily infect a sickly grandma or transplant patient, even if you are vaccinated.

And because the vaccinated immune response is so specific and widespread, there would be a lot of the same selective pressure across the nation to evolve the spike protein.

&gt;According to the available research and interviews with experts, one policy, the requirement to wear masks indoors, appears to have successfully slowed transmission. But others, namely school closures, don‚Äôt appear to have had nearly as much of an effect on case rates.

&gt;The evidence on lockdowns may be dicey, but the science on masks is clear: They work. Even experts I spoke with who think harsh lockdowns may have been counterproductive say indoor mask mandates were clearly effective.

&gt;‚ÄúIndoor masking guidance was proven to be effective,‚Äù Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the John Hopkins Center for Health Security, told me. ‚ÄúWhen you look at it all, I think that is probably going to be the one that shows the most effect. ... Most things can be done safely if people socially distance and wear a mask indoors in an unvaccinated setting.‚Äù

&gt;The available research supports that conclusion. In a study published in March 2021, CDC researchers examined case and death rates at the county level after mask mandates were put into place and found the mandates were associated with slower transmission.

&gt;‚ÄúMandating masks was associated with a decrease in daily Covid-19 case and death growth rates within 20 days of implementation,‚Äù they concluded, and the effect grew the longer the mandates were in place.

&gt;Mayor Bill de Blasio made the announcement during his daily press briefing Thursday, saying ""today is going to be one of those milestone days in our fight against covid"" and calling the lofty figure ""unbelievable.""

&gt;""This is a staggering figure,"" he said. ""This is how we are coming back. When you look around the country and you see other places that are struggling -- and I feel horrible for them -- in a lot of cases it's because their leaders didn‚Äôt do the right thing and didn‚Äôt focus on vaccination. Here together we did.""

&gt;De Blasio went on to say that while the figures show more than 84 percent have gotten at least one dose, a great percentage of those have already gone back to receive their second dose in a two-dose vaccination series.

&gt;""Six million people who have gone and done the right thing for themselves, for their families, their community gotten at least the first dose ‚Äì a lot of those people, of course the vast majority, have gotten the second dose by now as well,"" he said.

&gt;According to de Blasio, as of Thursday, over 84 percent of New York City adults have had at least one dose of the vaccine. Teenagers (12 and over) are at 75 percent vaccinated with at least one dose. (Pfizer is the only COVID-19 two-dose vaccine approved for individuals 12 years and older. Moderna, another two-dose vaccine, is approved for those 18 years and older. Johnson &amp; Johnson, the only one dose vaccine available in the United States, is also only approved for those 18 years and older.)

&gt;""As of now, over 84 percent of new York city adults have had at least one dose of the vaccine. Over 84 percent! That‚Äôs a super, super majority!,"" the mayor said. ""I like to say, when have you ever seen 84 percent of new Yorkers agree on anything else? Young people, teenagers, 75 percent already vaccinated.""

&gt;De Blasio went on to say that another ""encouraging trend"" that the city has been seeing is that ""as vaccinations have gone up, hospitalizations have gone down.""

&gt;Dr. Mitch Katz, the head of NYC Health + Hospitals, also said the city currently has the lowest hospitalization rate since the start of the pandemic. From a high of about 3,000 daily COVID patients at the height of the pandemic, the city‚Äôs 11 public hospitals now has just 70 COVID patients. Additionally, at the peak, H+H saw 960 in the ICU at their hospitals, but now that figure is at 16.

&gt;The mayor continues to encourage those who have not gotten vaccinated to do so. At the rate the city is going, de Blasio said, there are only about one million adult New Yorkers left that need to receive the COVID shot.

&gt;""At this point, there is only about one million adults left to be vaccinated and they keep coming in. The incentives the mandates, everything‚Äôs working,"" de Blasio said.

&gt;""We are so close to where we need to get. We have more work todo, COVID is not leaving us immediately, we have real work to do to finish this mission. Everyone can be a part of it. We can get there.""",,,,1634237529,{},hgn7eml,True,t3_q8648z,False,False,t3_q8648z,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q8648z/super_majority_85_of_nyc_adults_have_received_at/hgn7eml/,1634366678.0,25,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_58900d68,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There will be no state unemployment benefits for health care workers who are fired for refusing to get employer-mandated vaccinations against COVID-19, state officials said Thursday.

&gt;Already, a small number of workers have quit rather than be fully vaccinated ahead of the deadline at month‚Äôs end.

&gt;‚ÄúRefusing to comply with an employer‚Äôs policies, including a health or safety policy, typically disqualifies a person from being eligible to receive unemployment benefits,‚Äù Jessica Picard, spokesperson for the Maine Department of Labor, said Thursday.

&gt;But each unemployment application will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, she said, leaving the door open to exceptions.

&gt;A federal judge declined Wednesday to halt the governor's mandate that most health care workers be fully vaccinated. The state said it will begin enforcing the rule on Oct. 29.

&gt;Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston already began curtailing admissions and closed one department because of a staffing shortage linked to the vaccine requirement.

&gt;Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said the vaccine mandate alone isn't causing the workforce shortages. She noted that all businesses are facing shortages during the pandemic.

&gt;State agencies will work with individual hospitals and nursing homes ""to address individual workforce issues,‚Äù Mills said.

&gt;Mills announced the vaccine mandate on Aug. 12 for hospitals, nursing homes, dental practices and shelters.

So basically if there were more slots we‚Äôd be way better. 

&gt;‚ÄúThe departures are also taking their toll on nursing education, which relies on clinical instructors and preceptors, the experienced, hands-on nurses who mentor students on the job.

&gt;Nursing faculty is expected to shrink by 25% by 2025 across the country as nurses retire or leave because of burnout or other reasons, said Patricia Hurn, the nursing school dean at Michigan.

&gt;Mindy Schiebler, a cardiac nurse from Vancouver, Washington, taught nursing students for three years before quitting in 2016. She said she would love to still be teaching but that it‚Äôs not workable financially. She said she knows nursing professors who work multiple jobs or dip into their retirement savings.‚Äù

So now we‚Äôll probably have less slots available.

I'm not even sure I support employers mandating it but to make it a prerequisite enter a restaurant or store or to actually go as far as mandating that everyone who lives in the municipality receives it is not wise. Now we're talkin about requiring it for children which is really premature and slightly insane. It's been sad over and over again recently that your chances of dying from covid as a vaccinated adult are higher than a child with no pre-existing conditions. Because the risk of injury and death is so low and children I think we need to proceed very, very, very cautiously. This is one of the reasons I hate Anthony fauci. He's always moving the goalposts. Last spring it was that there would be no vaccine mandates and that there should probably be no vaccine mandates and then saying that children probably shouldn't be mandated to be vaccinated against covid and now, being the ship weasel that he is he's revealing that this was his plan all along and we were just too dumb to weigh the risks ourselves. I think vaccinating children against covid-19 outbreak should be the domain of the parents.

FDA scientists Marion Gruber and Philip Krause quit over it, and of course their last act was rejecting boosters for the general population.  It seemed like a giant ""f--- you"" to Biden and the American public. 

You can even read Krause's opinion piece in the Lancet detailing the motivation, and basically the reasoning was, ""Nobody cares about symptomatic Covid anymore or trying to stop the spread of the disease. 2 shots is good enough, because 70 is a pretty high number, right? Just think: 70. That's super duper high. And hey, it's still good protection from landing in the hospital. A third shot is probably way better, but umm... don't other countries need the vaccine more than us (and forget for a moment that it's not the FDA mandate to decide this)? By the way, me and Marion are over 65 so we'll be getting our boosters, but f--- all the rest of y'all. Peace out."" (paraphrasing here)

The CDC interpreted the FDA approval very liberally, for example you can get a booster if your BMI is over 25, which is 73% of the US.

Yup, and the only reason they worked is that flight crews and passengers were told to just comply with hijackers rather than risk injury or death, because up until 9/11 the hijackers just wanted something like money, clemency, to make a statement, etc. Once it became apparent that the hijackers were going to kill everyone on the plane no matter what, passengers revolted and Flight 93 ended up in a field instead of a building. It didn't even take a full day for those tactics to become outdated.

If anyone ever tries to hijack a plane like that again, passengers will tear the hijackers apart even if it means a few passengers may die, because they don't want another 9/11.

Pensions from employers were largely done away with in the 1970s onwards for myriad reasons. This ties hand in hand with the sustained assault on organized labor (unions) by right leaning ghouls and upper management at the same time. Oh, and let's not forget good ol' greed by the powers that be, as usual.

People generally now have 401ks, where the employee assumes the risk. If the stock market implodes two years before you retire and it wipes out 50% of your retirement nest egg, sucks to be you! Previously, if you had a pension from your company, the company was legally required to cover you until the day you died, and they didn't want to do that anymore.

The US state of Kentucky did not properly fund its pension fund for teachers, cops, etc. for decades on end because they were greedy and stupid. Lots of morons think money derived from taxes is taken to a pit and set alight and they vote accordingly. They promptly invited the wolf to guard their hen house by going to Wall Street. Then they basically said ""No new employees get a pension, no money, sorry."" [Here's a PBS Frontline documentary about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r0htm5uHPQ) (Youtube). It's fucking contemptible but here we are!

Oh, and a shitload of Americans don't even have the 401k anymore. It is **not** hard to find stories of people saying they have earned so little, with no 401k, that they will basically have to work until the day they die, because it's either that or poverty because our Social Security program here pays out based on how much you pay in over the course of your working life, and if you worked a life of shitty jobs, well....

I make very good money now in my IT job so, as long as I stay the course, I should be OK. But, as the system currently stands, there is going to be a horrific reckoning in a few decades regarding current Americans' retirement, or should I say inability to.

America: great if you're in the top 20% or so, increasingly third world nation if you're in the bottom 80% because of the ever-widening chasm between the haves and have-nots and how the rich generally would stand there and laugh at you, drinking their ice water, if you ran up to them engulfed in flames, wailing in pain as your skin bubbled and eyes melted.",,,,1634208765,{},hglhm09,False,t3_q7lnqv,False,False,t1_hgkupgi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q7lnqv/tsa_says_40_of_employees_are_unvaccinated_as/hglhm09/,1634334171.0,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_t9tzu,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They pull it because it looks a lot like plastic explosives under the X-ray.

X-ray‚Äôs show two colors on the screen.   
Blue = metal.    
Orange = everything else.


You can tell the density of an object by how transparent or opaque it is. The more dense an object the darker it will appear on a screen.

To identify the explosive part of an IED, you are trained to look for round or rectangular shapes that have a consistent medium=dark orange shade to them. 

When something like a book passes through, the tech will often have the bag re-sent through the X-ray and ask that it be shaken up. If the new perspective changes, even just a little bit, the tech can usually tell that it‚Äôs a book. Usually by identifying where the shades change in the binding or how the pages may layer. The image rarely shows a consistent shade. 

A tightly wound stack of trading cards will just appear as medium-dark orange material. When shaken up the cards will not change color all that much. As a result they will likely be flagged for further screening. This is why things like peanut butter, yogurt, cheese etc will almost always be flagged as well.

`Notwithstanding the moral permissibility of these vaccines, the Church treasuresher teaching on the sanctity of conscience. ‚ÄúConscience is the most secret core and sanctuary of a man. There he is alone with God, Whose voice echoes in his depths.‚Äù4 St.Paul VI wrote:`

`In all his activity a man is bound to follow his conscience inorder that he may come to God, the end and purpose of life.It follows that he is not to be forced to act in a manner contraryto his conscience. Nor, on the other hand, is he to berestrained from acting in accordance with his conscience,especially in matters religious.5`

But this doesn't change the fact that most people are weighing the benefits of in person social interaction against the risks and still choosing, of their own volition, to reduce points of physical interaction.

It is a truthful statement in the article. That is the reality we live in. People have different risk tolerances than you and by the sounds of it, most of them have smaller risk tolerances than you.

For example, I've not gone to the movie theatre in the last couple of months as much as I might have done if there wasn't a pandemic.

[],,maleslp,,,,,,[],"Upboat for rationally responding to my criticism :) And while I'm not wholly convinced that the argument you're making is necessarily an appeal to extremes (i.e. comparing rape to vaccination), it doesn't matter in the end. We understand where each other is coming from.

A more careful reading of both of our arguments I think comes down to the definition of ""force"". I think making one's life difficult for the greater public good is not necessarily forcing them into anything. You may be claiming that the state creating vaccines on behalf of businesses is forcing them, but I see it as not outside the scope of regulation, which is absolutely a state's role. I'm not quite clear why you're using the term force though so I won't assume.

""For one, the notion that an antibody test isn't sufficient to demonstrate alternatively acquired immunity is absurd.""

Agreed.

Further, I don't disagree with your claim that the mRNA vaccines are new in their deployment at scale, but based on your responses thus far, I'm assuming you're also aware of their history and that their use on humans is not new (\~10 years now). The delivery method is new if I'm not mistaken, but there has to be a point where things are delivered at scale, and this wasn't exactly a bad time to consider it in my opinion.

&gt;The vaccines have demonstrated to be highly efficacious against infectivity and spread for 2 months after vaccination, after which the presence of antibodies rapidly diminishes.

You've also read that Lancet paper. Fascinating! And that's why boosters are being recommended. Frankly, we had to get the vaccine out without a longitudinal study on what the best delivery is (e.g. dosage, number of doses, time between doses, etc.). My guess is Pfizer made a best guess of 21 days prior to initial trial and they were sort of stuck with that. Other countries are doing all sorts of other things and they're doing just fine.

&gt;So the conversation regarding vaccines, as you've framed it, is not entirely accurate. Vaccines which were administered more than a few months ago are playing a seriously diminished role in regards to the epidemiological aspect of the pandemic, and more in terms of protecting the individual who actually received the vaccine from the worst outcomes of the disease.

I'd argue the efficacy of a 3 or 4 week apart, 2-dose vaccine ""wanes"" closer to 3 or 4 months (your claim was 2), but that's just an interpretation of risk (expressed as a percentage of efficacy) I guess. I'm not quite sure what you're getting at here though. Are you saying that the vaccines aren't as effective as we thought for spread, so why get them? Perhaps that there's no way that vaccination alone will get this thing under control? I don't know of a particular study on just how contagious vaccinated individuals are at various stages post being ""fully vaccinated"", but my guess is it's high - hard to say. since we don't have good data. I did hear about a single study that swabbed noses which did find that the Delta variant was just as contagious in vaccinated or non-vaccinated, but that was a pretty narrow look at viral spread and, well, a single study. I think it's pretty safe to say that COVID cases have come down as a whole since the introduction of vaccines. Since most people got their vaccines in the Spring of 2020, I guess we'll see soon enough.

I think we're just going to have to agree to disagree on the ""force"", ""new"" technology, and ""efficacy"" issues. I think the data on vaccines (in general) backs up the fact that they work, and once enough people get them then ""forcing"" them is going to be a nonissue. I think most of people's anger at mandates is entirely political. My support of mandates is protection of my family and a desire to return to ""normalcy"" (whatever the hell that's going to look like). Your argument, while I don't agree, is perhaps the most coherent one I've heard since mandates started. I spent some time overseas recently, and I agree that it doesn't have to be a one-size-fits-all solution. Antibody tests, PCR tests, and vaccine certificates can all be used in conjunction with one another to return to a safer society.",,,,1634163648,{},hgjgki4,False,t3_q78quh,False,True,t1_hgj6buo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q78quh/vaccine_hesitant_new_yorkers_consider_leaving_the/hgjgki4/,1634293362.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_6ouk3,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Melatonin may be beneficial in preventing complications in patients with COVID-19.

‚Ä¢
Melatonin can be used to reduce the mortality rate in patients with COVID-19.

‚Ä¢
Melatonin may be beneficial as an adjuvant therapy in patients with COVID-19.

Abstract
The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of melatonin on thrombosis, sepsis, and mortality rate in adult patients with severe coronavirus infection (COVID-19).

Methods: This single-center, prospective, randomized clinical trial was conducted from 1 December 2020 to 1 June 2021 at Al-Shifaa hospital in Mosul, Iraq. There were 158 patients with severe COVID-19 included in the study, 82 in the melatonin group (who received 10 mg melatonin in addition to standard therapeutic care), and 76 in the control group (given standard therapeutic care only). Patients were chosen by blocked randomization design. The physician then evaluated and recorded the incidence of thrombosis, sepsis, and mortality rate on days 5, 11, and 17 of symptoms.

Results: The intervention group consisted of 82 patients, while the control group consisted of 76 patients. In comparison to the control group, thrombosis and sepsis developed significantly less frequently (P &lt; 0.05) in the melatonin group during the second week of infection, while mortality was significantly higher in the control group (P &lt; 0.05).

Conclusions: Adjuvant use of Melatonin may help reduce thrombosis, sepsis, and mortality in COVID-19 patients.",,,,1634163510,{},hgjg9ff,True,t3_q7m1uk,False,True,t3_q7m1uk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q7m1uk/the_effect_of_melatonin_on_thrombosis_sepsis_and/hgjg9ff/,1634293205.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,WackyBeachJustice,,,,,,[],"First I never said the vaccine will end the pandemic in 6 months.  I argued they will shorten it, which you said they won't.  So you're being disingenuous.  It's a basic mathematical equation, reducing cases by a wide margin reduces spread by a wide margin, reducing needless hospitalizations and deaths.

Second of all, you're now invoking the 1 shot withheld in the US = 1 shot administered in Africa.  If that the argument you want to make, cut the bullshit and just say it how it is.  Most people, including Scott G, our administration, etc. don't believe that's how it actually plays out.  But I'm not going to go into that, you can read more on that in a discussion linked above in my post.

Lastly you're pulling a lot of things out of your bunghole.  All we know is the multiplier by which the booster increases antibodies over the second shot.  If we assume the same linear regression, that shot might easily become an annual or longer shot.  So stop with this ""you need a new booster every 6 months"" bullshit, that's antivaxx talk.  No one knows this.  Some suspect this could easily be a 3 and done situation, or at most annual shot as part of the annual flu shot.  We don't fucking know until we do it.

Your argument is fucking dumb.  You don't give up ""for now"" in hope for a better ""later"".  First of all nasal vaccines are being developed regardless.  If we manage to get this shit under control without them, that's a fucking WIN.  If we don't, then we'll have them, if we have them.  We also have therapeutics coming online.  Just calling it quits now and having needless infections, needless spread, needless hospitalizations, needless deaths.  For what reason?  So we can ""concentrate on better vaccines""?

Basically the only reason J&amp;J appears to be less effective is because of its higher dosage. I know, sounds counterintuitive but taken into consideration that you only get 1 higher dosed jab instead of 2 lower dosed ones it all makes sense. Basically the efficacy against Delta is based on a high antibody count and with a higher overall dosage you end up with a higher antibody count and therefore with a more effective protection. And it's only natural that J&amp;J would profit more from a booster than the other two because it has a lower overall dosage. So basically what Biontech/Moderna achieve with 3 jobs, J&amp;J does with 2. And why wouldn't it? It's essentially the same vaccine.

But if you administer 2 jabs of a vaccine that has a lower dosage per jab of course you will end up with more antibodies than just administering 1 jab with a higher dosage per jab. Which was prudent for the time when that was tested and decided to be sufficient because it was very effective against the variants tested against. The only reason Biontech/Moderna are more effective against Delta is because you end up with more antibodies over a longer period of time because of the 2 jabs that combined have a higher overall dosage than J&amp;J leading to more antibodies. And of course that 1 jab vaccine will profit the most from a booster, read 2nd jab.

We pay for drugs, most people pay for their routine healthcare too, although there are caps, so for example there is a maximum you can be charged for drugs per month, and over that the government covers it; there's a set maximum you can be charged per day in a hospital, and there's also a max per year, etc.

We pay for dental, we pay for primary care, direct to the GP who are private businesses.

Lower income people who pass a means test get more of these fees covered, so they don't have to pay these fees. But most people do have to pay for healthcare. It's just capped so you can't get like a ‚Ç¨1 million bill, that doesn't happen. But we do still have to pay for routine healthcare, unless we are broke, and this goes for well off pensioners as well, they have to pay too.

I think this works pretty well. I think it works better than the US system.

This paper examines whether the opening of K‚Äì12 schools may lead to the spread of COVID-19. Analyzing how an increase of COVID-19 cases is related to the timing of opening K‚Äì12 schools in the United States, we find that counties that opened K‚Äì12 schools with in-person learning experienced an increase in the growth rate of cases by 5 percentage points on average, controlling for a variety of policies, past infection rates, and other factors. This association of K‚Äì12 school visits with case growth is stronger when mask wearing is not mandated for staff at school. These findings support policies that promote masking and other precautionary measures at schools and giving vaccine priority to education workers.  
  
Abstract  
This paper empirically examines how the opening of K‚Äì12 schools is associated with the spread of COVID-19 using county-level panel data in the United States. As preliminary evidence, our event-study analysis indicates that cases and deaths in counties with in-person or hybrid opening relative to those with remote opening substantially increased after the school opening date, especially for counties without any mask mandate for staff. Our main analysis uses a dynamic panel data model for case and death growth rates, where we control for dynamically evolving mitigation policies, past infection levels, and additive county-level and state-week ‚Äúfixed‚Äù effects. This analysis shows that an increase in visits to both K‚Äì12 schools and colleges is associated with a subsequent increase in case and death growth rates. The estimates indicate that fully opening K‚Äì12 schools with in-person learning is associated with a 5 (SE = 2) percentage points increase in the growth rate of cases. We also find that the association of K‚Äì12 school visits or in-person school openings with case growth is stronger for counties that do not require staff to wear masks at schools. These findings support policies that promote masking and other precautionary measures at schools and giving vaccine priority to education workers.",,,,1634218818,{},hglyqlj,True,t3_q7zx8i,False,True,t3_q7zx8i,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q7zx8i/the_association_of_opening_k12_schools_with_the/hglyqlj/,1634343452.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

$1,200 for rent in a pretty small 1 bedroom apartment, decently safe, way out in the burbs. Around $400 a month (maybe more now?) for his Part D insurance premium.

 The consequence of this is that in countries with privatized health care systems that the tracking numbers of covid cases run far behind the actual data on the ground. This difference in what's happening and what's being reported is glaringly obvious and feeds conspiracy theorists.

 In countries with national health care systems, that are functioning, not only do they have excess capacity to absorb the pandemic cases,  But they also have the ability to actually track the cases in real time in a public way. It's not that they always do this but they can  If they wanted to.

Capitalism does not pay for having excess capacity sitting around not being used. A privatized health care system does not have the beds to deal with the pandemic. This is not an accident. This is the way the system is designed. Money before lives. Profit before common good. This is why in every other Western country in the world they have chosen to create a national health care system.

 A small impact of this choice is what you are seeing and asking about in your question.

Oh and if I quit too soon they take the match back. I‚Äôve seen anywhere from 2 to 6 years to be ‚Äúfully vested‚Äù - meaning I get to keep the full company match amount. Some companies have tiers, so 2 years is 20% vested, 4 years is 50% vested, etc.

If you still feel the need to get more information, only check once or twice per week or something. You should consider deciding how important it is to know the minute details of Covid in areas that don't affect you. Again, if it's a big enough deal, it'll hit larger publications and outlets. 

Also, there's no reason you have to be a personal reporter to those around you (I saw your other comment). It does not take very long to hit up some headlines and get informed. Don't enable people to not do their part to stay informed. In fact, I'm sure it takes longer for them to hear it from you than if they were to quickly skim the headlines and read a couple articles themselves. I was the educator in my circle too for awhile. It gets annoying, and word of mouth, no matter how diligent you are, muddies the reporting, leaves out the citations and sources, and also encourages them to get information from other non-journalist sources such as random people online. 

Lastly, I think it's important to only get into the weeds on numbers and trends if it affects you personally. I have an aggressive autoimmune disease and a mom with severe cancer. It's helpful to know how many people in my city and county are getting Covid and to track it weekly as new numbers come out. If someone is not at-risk, as long as they are vaccinated and follow precautions, there's no reason to be a armchair data analyst.

I hope this helps.

TLDR, it's complicated and even a simplistic answer like mine lacks the nuance to really get into it in detail. If you disagree with my take, you probably have experiences I don't that inform your view. Everyone has a different facet they are experiance based on so major factors, and ... it's complicated. That said...

Police as a whole tend to have bad reputations due to ... really a ton of things, but the most glaring one is that some percentage of cops are not good cops, I.E. they are racist, classist, power trippy, etc. These conflicts between cops and society become highly visible, and the taint of those bad cops affects the image of all of them. 

Add in that most interactions you will have with a cop is going to be on some level adversarial, (I.E. You did thing wrong, Cop must apply legal discipline for wrong thing) and the stress on both parties can get pretty high. Cops getting trashed on all day by ""Karens"" or even just getting the run-off stress from a reasonable person who is now late for X and is upset in general, and the interaction can be unpleasant. This re-enforces the bad image the civilian has, and the officer gets a sour image of those they protect, which can lead to becoming a bad cop.

There are also bad policies the departments are bound to follow which discriminate or allow for discrimination to run rampant. 

The problem is that all parties (in broad terms) have valid points, and like most every issue, it's complicated. There is no easy fix, and it gets turbulent trying to fix the issues when the various groups allow emotional rhetoric, however earned, to rule the dialogue. 

My take is that there is a lot of reform that needs doing, but that has to occur on a departmental level since that is where most policy seems to reside. We also need to realize that cops are humans too, with all the flaws and positives that come with being human. We need to see that a good chunk of the police force are great people in an adversarial position and treat them kindly until they show they are not great people. We need to drop a hammer on those cops that are abusing their power, and we need accountability on every side. I think body cams for cops and dashcams in cars are a great way of helping on that.

Al Qaeda are most certainly not exempt from criticism and mockery. That is a totally bizarre thing to claim.

You know what is a bigotted sentament? The idea that Al Qaeda and other extremist groups are in any way linked to the way the vast majority of Muslims are. To say that making fun of Al Qaeda is bigotted against Muslims is the same as saying making fun of the KKK is making fun of Americans, or making fun of the IRA is making fun of Irish people. No, the only bigotted aspect there is the person who doesn't see the difference between the extremist group and the general population of people who share something with them whether it be national origin or religion. No one was doing that here but you.

[],,NashvilleHot,,,,,,[],"&gt;How does the vaccine have health consequences with people around the person? 

Vaccines:
1) Reduce a person‚Äôs chance of infection by 5-8x, and reduces chance of hospitalization by 10-25x. 
2) Shorten incubation and how long a person is contagious by 30-50%, if in the much smaller event they get infected. 

Both of these things directly help the community and their family because they are less likely to get sick (and need to take time off work), less likely to infect others, less likely to need hospital resources, and less likely to incubate and transmit a new variant. 

&gt;That'd not even close to being a good statement. Your saying people should get it to help the others around them. That makes zero sense. 

See above. 

&gt;If those people want to be protected, they are more then welcome to as they see fit. And, freedom isn't a legal fact?? Have you never gone to school? Is the constitution not legal then? 

Please read the constitution and then get back to us. Only certain rights are considered ‚Äúinalienable‚Äù, and there are almost 3 centuries of legal precedent that establish where the lines are drawn. Vaccine mandates were used as far back as General Washington and SCOTUS ruled on it in 1905, upholding vaccine mandates. 

https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/blog/jacobson-v-massachusetts-reiss

&gt;But either way, it is absolutely not in the government's right to mandate it. They don't rule over us.

If you really believe this, you can move somewhere that has no government. 

But I suspect you know that your statement is ridiculous on its face. You follow all kinds of laws every day and benefit from them too. The government is why you can go about your day not worrying the food from the supermarket will make you sick, drive knowing that other motorists will stop at red lights, and that your house is probably wired correctly and won‚Äôt burn you up in an electrical fire.",,,,1634213654,{},hglowcn,False,t3_q78quh,False,True,t1_hgjudey,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q78quh/vaccine_hesitant_new_yorkers_consider_leaving_the/hglowcn/,1634338175.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_15ucsa,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,Ema_non,,,,,,,"&gt;Russia reported a new record number of daily coronavirus deaths and infections Thursday, as officials sound the alarm over the strain placed on the country‚Äôs hospitals from an unremitting fourth wave of the pandemic.  
The government‚Äôs coronavirus information center reported **986 fatalities** over the past 24 hours, up from the previous records of 984, set Wednesday.  
Russia also reported an all-time high of **31,299 new coronavirus cases, almost 2,000 more than the previous high set on Dec. 24, 2020.**  
Russia has now set a new record number of fatalities for **12 of the last 16 days.**  
Surging cases and fatalities puts Russia at odds with the global trend of a pandemic showing some signs of a retreat. The World Health Organization (WHO) said earlier this week that global deaths from Covid-19 are falling and have reached their lowest levels in almost a year.  
Russia‚Äôs Health Minister Mikhail Murashko issued a stark warning earlier Thursday that 1.1 million patients are currently being treated for Covid-19 ‚Äî **‚Äúthe highest strain‚Äù that has been put on Russia‚Äôs healthcare system since the start of the pandemic.**  
Murashko urged skeptical Russians to get vaccinated and **called on retired doctors to come out of retirement to help treat the growing numbers of patients.**  
Only a third of Russians have been vaccinated against the coronavirus, and opinion polls show more than half of the population do not plan on getting a shot.  
The government‚Äôs official death toll since the start of the pandemic stands at 220,315 ‚Äî Europe‚Äôs highest ‚Äî while Russia‚Äôs total excess fatality count during the same period is at least 660,000.  
The Kremlin has ruled out imposing a lockdown to help stop the spread of the virus. Dozens of Russian regions have introduced vaccine mandates for certain categories of workers and vaccine passports for entry into crowded indoor venues in an attempt to boost weak uptake.",,,,1634204729,{},hglcscc,True,t3_q7wbxv,False,True,t3_q7wbxv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q7wbxv/russia_sets_new_record_coronavirus_cases/hglcscc/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_194s0r,False,False,False,34e37abc813772009a7ec9186b02080c249180fd,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1634204739.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

my argument is to develop better game instead of fighting over the current suboptimal game. Like you said, this has been primary discussion because this is the only discussion.

[],,jaderust,,,,,,[],"Social Security is pretty much the same thing as the pension program a lot of counties have. It‚Äôs not much money, but it does help old people survive. Every US citizen gets Social Security though how much you get out varies depending on how much SS taxes you paid in your lifetime. 

Pensions in the US are usually company paid programs where they give you additional money in retirement. They‚Äôre pretty much non-existent anymore. Really only the federal government and some state or local governments do them anymore. A true US pension is a promise to pay X amount a month for the rest of your life like social security does.

Most people in the US have retirement programs, not pensions. In that system people contribute to a retirement fund, usually called a 401k that is set up so that people can‚Äôt withdraw money from it early without being penalized. That keeps people from touching it usually. Companies will also contribute to the individual‚Äôs 401k at set amounts up to certain levels as an employment benefit, but there‚Äôs no standard as to how much a company has to contribute. The other issue with 401ks is that when you retire that money in the account is all you get. If you spend it too quickly there‚Äôs no promise from your employer for more so you can run out of you live too long. 

Because of all this pensions are still a big deal in the US. It‚Äôs guaranteed income in retirement which is pretty much unheard of except for SS. The TSA, being part of a federal agency, gets a person Social Security AND a pension AND a 401k style retirement fund (called a TSP) which pretty much no one else offers in the private sector. Considering you can get a TSA job with zero education besides a high school degree that‚Äôs a pretty choice job, especially since the salary is pretty high for that level of education, the work is all indoors, and the health benefits are good. Really the only downside is that you sometimes have to work holidays or night shifts in some locations where airports are open 24/7.

&gt;An average of 362,000 people a day got boosters over the past week, about 57% more than the 231,000 people per day who started their first doses, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

&gt;‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of reminiscent of those early days when over-65 qualified in a priority group and we saw people flooding websites and pharmacies and clinics,‚Äù Dr. Kavita Patel, a primary care physician in Washington who worked on health-care initiatives in the Obama administration, said about the high demand for boosters on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box‚Äù on Tuesday. 

&gt;U.S. regulators authorized booster shots of Pfizer and BioNTech‚Äôs vaccine to a wide array of Americans in late September, including the elderly, adults with underlying medical conditions and those who work or live in high-risk settings like health and grocery workers. The move made roughly 60 million Americans eligible for a third shot, President Joe Biden said in an address following the CDC‚Äôs endorsement.

&gt;About 8.9 million boosters overall have been administered as of Wednesday, CDC data shows, covering 4.7% of all fully vaccinated Americans and more than 12% of the immunized 65 and older population. 

&gt;‚ÄúThose that are coming in and getting the booster vaccine are very comfortable with the vaccine, understand the benefit and have seen the benefit,‚Äù said Dr. Annamaria Macaluso Davidson, who practices at Memorial Hermann Medical System, a group of 17 hospitals in Houston.

&gt;A surge in cases this summer driven by the highly contagious delta variant is convincing some people to get the vaccine for the first time, she said. ‚ÄúThose that are just coming in and starting, they would have had hesitancies for different reasons, and maybe finally consulted with a physician to understand that getting the vaccine outweighs any risk, and far outweighs the risk of getting Covid,‚Äù she said.

&gt;The rush for additional doses among fully vaccinated people highlights the divide between the vaccinated and unvaccinated, according to Rupali Limaye, a faculty member at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Limaye studies vaccine decision making and has been working with state health departments during the vaccine rollout. 

&gt;Because many of those getting third doses are the same people who were most eager to get shots earlier this year, boosters will give those people even stronger protection while the unvaccinated remain largely unprotected and at a substantially higher risk of hospitalization or death if they get Covid.

&gt;‚ÄúWe want to spread protection throughout a community,‚Äù Limaye said. ‚ÄúWe will have a portion of the population that will be well protected, and a proportion of the population that has had zero shots.‚Äù

&gt;A Kaiser Family Foundation survey released last month showed that the emergency approval of Pfizer‚Äôs booster shots for some people has done little to improve the split in attitudes on Covid-19 vaccines.

&gt;Among those surveyed, nearly 80% of the people who were vaccinated said news of the third doses shows that scientists are trying to make the shots more effective, but 71% of the unvaccinated said boosters are proof that the vaccines don‚Äôt work.

&gt;Limaye said this misunderstanding about third doses echoes conversations happening at town halls and community groups across the country. Because U.S. health officials weren‚Äôt clear enough up front that boosters are an expected part of an immunization process, it has raised questions about why another shot is needed.

&gt;‚ÄúWe need to do a better job, in my opinion, saying that this is just how it is like any other virus,‚Äù Limaye said, ‚Äúand that we have to get boosters because immunity wanes over time.‚Äù

&gt;Dr. Aaron Clark, a family medicine physician at The Ohio State University‚Äôs Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio, said the interest he sees in boosters ‚Äúfar outweighs the demand for first shots.‚Äù

&gt;Average daily Covid cases in the U.S. fell below 100,000 last week as the pandemic shows signs of easing, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, with more than 56% of the U.S. population fully vaccinated. Still, while down from recent peaks, the country is reporting an average of more than 1,600 daily Covid deaths.

&gt;U.S. officials have repeatedly said that the vast majority of those currently hospitalized and dying because of Covid are unvaccinated.

&gt;A key Food and Drug Administration advisory panel will meet on Thursday and Friday to discuss the efficacy and safety of extra doses of the Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines. Of the 188 million fully vaccinated Americans, 55% have received the Pfizer shots, 37% received Moderna, and 8% received a Johnson &amp; Johnson shot, according to the CDC.",,,,1634223053,{},hgm8day,True,t3_q81862,False,False,t3_q81862,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q81862/more_americans_are_getting_covid_vaccine_boosters/hgm8day/,1634348578.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_58900d68,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yeah it is a huge issue. The problem (in my view) is that we aren't at a point yet where we know what type of risk avoidance behavior is still *acceptable* and where it borders on being unhealthy.  I think a lot of people are suffering from pretty severe forms of anxiety disorders but there is still such a large grey area of what is an 'acceptable level' of this sort of precaution. In a lot of spaces (especially online) there is a lot of tolerance for people being extremely risk averse that for other thing we would see as very problematic. At what point does the collective agree that wiping down groceries isn't a sign of 'just being extra careful' but rather an expression of some sort of trauma induced anxiety disorder? It doesn't help that there is a strong moral undercurrent which allows some people social rewards for showcasing how careful they are being -- it is enabling and reinforcing anxious thinking patterns.

If I were Fauci I would consider this plan:

Start with very healthy + previously vaccinated people and expose them to a viral load (large enough to make sure it creates an immune response) paired with Merek‚Äôs pill (to inhibit the virus‚Äôs ability to replicate). Check for antibodies before/after. Then if it goes well scale out to more people.

However I don‚Äôt see this gaining support because:

1) Our country is quite divided. The anti vax folks will use it as approval to ignore Covid and a reason to skip the vax. 

2) There has been so much effort put into getting people to take Covid seriously.  Telling people there is a safe way to experience Covid would break peoples brain.

[],,NatoRawr,,,,,,[],"Nice! Thank you for this response! Engaging the question instead of saying ‚ÄúdUh AnYoNe‚Äù.


I totally agree with you that when there‚Äôs space, people will fill it. Although some jobs require more training or skill to be hired, I think the narrative gets lost with ‚Äúcop that doesn‚Äôt take the shot = bad cop.‚Äù Which is 100% not the case. If we think that this some how flushes out cops that are doing illegal shit or are bad at their jobs, then we are straight up wrong. You‚Äôre going to lose both good and bad from this mandate. A cop not wanting the shot is not a bad cop because of this, period. 

Now the point about people filling those spots comes at a curious standpoint. We already have a low supply of people applying to be officers because of recent events and lack of respect. Cops used to be a very respectful job but that‚Äôs a whole different conversation. So we have less people looking to be police officers, pay is not what it used to be in some states, and more rules come into place with more exposure to the inner workings (which is not always a bad thing, just makes them uncomfortable). 

I think your point that some people will rise from within and fill those spots is 100%! What happens when a star football player gets injured or retires? Someone else steps in and has the chance to become great! It‚Äôs going to be interesting to see if they lower their standards or just work with less.

Someone made a great point of splitting work that does not require police to handle to those other jobs which I think is the real answer.

&gt;RESULTS  
&gt;  
&gt;Confirmed infection rates were ‚âà10-fold lower in the booster versus nonbooster group (ranging 8.8-17.6 across five age groups) and 4.8-11.2 fold lower in the secondary analysis. **Severe illness rates in the primary and secondary analysis were 18.7-fold (95% CI, 15.7-22.4) and 6.5-fold (95% CI, 5.1-8.3) lower for ages 60+, and 22.0-fold (95% CI, 10.3-47.0) and 3.2-fold (95% CI, 1.1-9.6) lower for ages 40-60. For ages 60+, COVID-19 associated death rates were 14.7-fold (95% CI, 9.4-23.1) lower in the primary analysis and 4.8-fold (95% CI, 2.8-8.2) lower in the secondary analysis.**

CONCLUSIONS

&gt;**Across all age groups**, rates of confirmed infection **and severe illness were substantially lower among those who received a booster dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine.**

You infer the following.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;**2** *2a* A preponderance of bad news means that things are not bad, because *2b* it entails that bad things are the exception.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;**3** *3a* A preponderance of good news means that things are not good, because *3b* it entails that good things are the exception.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;**4** Little news means things are good.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Here is a worry about 4. Why does it follow from your 1? Why not infer instead from 1 that things are bad? After all, no good things are being reported . .

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Here is a worry about 2 and 3. Does 2b really follow from 2a? Does 3b really follow from 3a? For, what if the norm consisted in very bad things or in very good things? Then the merely somewhat bad or merely somewhat good would be exceptional.
