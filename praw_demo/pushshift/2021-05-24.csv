He favored a natural origin theory, he said, in part because he had assumed that all the Wuhan Institute‚Äôs 2019 work with SARS-like viruses had been done in its top-level BSL-4 lab, which was cleared to operate in 2017. (State Department cables from 2018 raised questions about how well-run the lab was.)
But later he learned of studies with Dr. Shi‚Äôs name on them showing that work he considers dangerous had been done in level BSL-2 labs, which he considers highly porous to leaks, not just in 2016, but in 2020.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs screwed up,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt shouldn‚Äôt have happened. People should not be looking at bat viruses in BSL-2 labs. My view has changed.‚Äù

\- The overwhelming majority of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is via large respiratory droplets as conclusively demonstrated by contact tracing studies, cluster investigations, the lack of infection spread in hospital settings with universal masking protocols and the low estimated""

It was only recently discovered that the 5 micron number was out of context. People just accepted it as fact. It had to be proven wrong, and once it was conclusively shown to be incorrect, the guidance changed. All that took over a year.

""Modes of transmission of the COVID-19 virusRespiratory infections can be transmitted through droplets of different sizes: when the droplet particles are &gt;5-10 Œºm in diameter they are referred to as respiratory droplets, and when then are &lt;5Œºm in diameter, they are referred to as droplet nuclei.1 According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes.2-7 

In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported.7Droplet transmission occurs when a person is in in close contact (within 1 m) with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing or sneezing) and is therefore at risk of having his/her mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets. Transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person.8 

Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer).

Airborne transmission is different from droplet transmission as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally considered to be particles &lt;5Œºm in diameter, can remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 m.In the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures or support treatments that generate aerosols are performed; i.e., endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

There is some evidence that COVID-19 infection may lead to intestinal infection and be present in faeces. However, to date only one study has cultured the COVID-19 virus from a single stool specimen.9  There have been no reports of faecal‚àíoral transmission of the COVID-19 virus to date.""

So they are noting droplet transmission which is essentially airborne transmission. I think you are splitting hairs here.

Next time, please be more specific as it's important. If you feel the WHO did not communicate properly, be specific. They were clearly noting how Covid was being spread fairly early.

And with our government so willing to hand vital services contracts to questionable companies like Serco, who are currently involved in the test and trace system (though I don't know if they were involved in this particular programme), it made me wonder.

But I haven't doubled down, I asked the dude if I understood what they just told me.

&gt;So you're saying this actually means tracing people the 15 had contact with, which could mean a lot more than just 15 people are being traced**?**

Did you notice the question mark, indicating that I am asking a question, not making a statement, ^(it's at the end of the sentence)?

&amp;#x200B;

As for thinking about what I'm saying, perhaps you should practice what you preach.

&gt;How would they know 15 people were infected if they didn‚Äôt know who those people were.

Not only did I read the article, but I also have additional knowledge from other sources, so I am aware that the attendees at the pilot events will be taking home PCR tests pre and post event.

Assuming they actually bother to send in their post event test results, each test is presumably marked as belonging to the pilot events, so any positive results will be known to come from those events, even if they don't know who the test belongs to.

And this leaves me to wonder if the tests are individually registered to attendees, or are reliant on the attendee accurately self labelling their test with their contact details, hence my wonder if they are tracing someone they don't have contact details for.

&amp;#x200B;

We have 2 elderly celebrities that were fully vaccinated with Sinopharm and still died. I don't know how many non-celebrities met the same fate. My mother did not get an immune response from this vaccine as well. I do not want to take a bet with her life on whether the vaccine did give some type of immunity on the many levels of our immune system or not.

Any country that imported it has close ties to China and do not want to say anything to upset them or hurt their own ratings. Therefore, the massive pleas from our people asking to get vaccinated again with a vector vaccine or mRNA are ignored. Instead, Serbia just donated 100k of Pfizer doses to Czech Republic because otherwise they would go to waste. There were simply no more people interested in getting it, apart from the group that got Sinopharm already.

This is a huge mistake. WHO announced pandemic only after seeing alarming levels of inaction. It put too much trust in those govs. What you mentioned here is just another example. It needs change, so it will be able to actually ENFORCE govs to take action in time.

I recommend you to watch it because it is quite interesting some of the measures they did.

I also have another channel of information which I didn't even realise until recently. I work for an US firm and we have global presence.

They have been back in the office and working normally since mid last year. One of the project we had this year was to expand our Indian operation. That is now paused until at least next year. At the same time we are investing and expanding more in China. We aren't the only one. FDI (Foreign direct investment) to China has been increasing and it even overtook US last year as the top.

You have to understand firms like the one I work for don't care what the media or the government says. We have teams on the ground in those countries.

Every Communist movement of the 20th century - from the Russian Bolsheviks to Convention People's Party of Ghana - was run by Marxists. Marxists believe that all societies originate as Feudalistic, and that once Feudalism causes enough material issues in that society, they transition to Capitalism. Eventually, Marxists claim, Capitalism will degrade material conditions to the extent that the society chooses to switch to Socialism. In Marxist philosophy, the same process will unfold with Socialism and the society will become Communist. Every single Communist in any position of power since the end of the 19th century - Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Deng, Ceausescu, Nkrumah, Ho Chi Minh, et al - were Marxists trying to establish a Socialist government to bring their nations closer to Communism in the long-run.

The very existence of the Chinese government proves that China is not a Communist country, as Communism is simply the belief in a *stateless*, classless, moneyless society.",,,1621941708,{},gzdnz1k,False,t3_nk3vlk,False,False,t1_gzdmyvk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nk3vlk/dr_fauci_says_hes_not_convinced_covid19_developed/gzdnz1k/,1622019652,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_8nfnxm6y,False,False,,

Given this evidence it seemed more likely to think this pandemic started the same way most other pandemics through history; via animal human contact. But if course, a scientists job is to continue to collect evidence to challenge this understanding and update our conclusions as that evidence comes out.

&gt;	By midsummer, in communities with high vaccination rates, covid-19 starts to fade from view. In those places, even people who remain unvaccinated are protected, because so little of the virus circulates. But, in other parts of the country, low immunization rates combined with reopening allow the disease to register again. Hospitals aren‚Äôt overwhelmed‚Äîthere‚Äôs no need to build new I.C.U.s or call in extra staff‚Äîbut the collision between ship and iceberg is forceful, and each week thousands of people fall ill and hundreds die. Some victims are vaccine-hesitant; others were unable, for whatever reason, to get vaccinated. Still, perhaps unfairly, these outbreaks come with an aura of culpability: to people in safe parts of the country, the ill seem like smokers who get lung cancer.

The summer surge (and even worse winter one) is very possible in areas of low vaccination rates.

The country as a whole is kind of basking in this seasonal lull‚Ä¶honestly I hadn‚Äôt really thought about the summer surge myself until reading this.

Mid June-early August, if last year is any indication, could be quite tragic and alarming in some places, while at the same exact time other areas with higher immunity continue to live as normal and largely COVID free.

Makes it all the more frustrating that there are so many who are refusing the vaccine.

""With those odds your chances of dying from COVID after receiving the vaccine is 1 in 627,329""

\- This comparison assumes that all 101 million people who got the vaccine were exposed to COVID, which is unlikely since the vaccine has been around for 5 months or so.

So the only way at this point in time to understand the true effectiveness of the vaccine is to see how it's doing against what it was designed for:

1. According to the CDC: ""Studies show that COVID-19 vaccines are effective at keeping you from getting COVID-19. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine will also help keep you from getting seriously ill even if you do get COVID-19.""Source: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/keythingstoknow.html?s\_cid=10493:vaccines%20for%20covid:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY21](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/keythingstoknow.html?s_cid=10493:vaccines%20for%20covid:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY21)
2. COVID-19 is the disease developed from SARS COV-2 the virus.

Source: [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20479963#:\~:text=In%202019%2C%20a%20new,COVID%2D19](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20479963#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20a%20new,COVID%2D19)).

This means that we can try and gauge the true effectiveness of the vaccine based on data about people known who have contracted the virus.

3. ""A total of 10,262 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine breakthrough infections had been reported""

These are the number of people known who have contracted the virus after vaccination.

4. Case Fatality Rate: ""CFR is the ratio of the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed (preferably by nucleic acid testing) cases of disease. ""

Source: [https://www.virology.ws/2020/04/05/infection-fatality-rate-a-critical-missing-piece-for-managing-covid-19/](https://www.virology.ws/2020/04/05/infection-fatality-rate-a-critical-missing-piece-for-managing-covid-19/)

CFR is a metric to determine fatality based on number of people known to contract the virus.

5.  (Jan 28, 2021) - ""Between the first peak in mid-April and the second peak in mid-July, the case fatality rate in the United States fell from 7.9% to the 0.7%‚Äì2.3% range, where it has since remained despite cases rising again into an (ongoing) third wave:""

Source: [https://delphi.cmu.edu/blog/2021/01/28/unpacking-the-drop-in-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/](https://delphi.cmu.edu/blog/2021/01/28/unpacking-the-drop-in-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/)

So the CFR of the 'control' is between .7-2.3% since the vaccine wasn't really widely available a few months back.

6. The CFR according to the breakthrough cases of  death (if we remove  the 28 people who died for unrelated symptoms) is broken down like this:

(160-28)/(10,262-28) = **1.3% CFR.**

The CFR of vaccinated individuals fits within the .7-2.3% CFR range of mostly unvaccinated individuals data from Jan.

So can someone tell me how this shows that the vaccine is actually working well in this context?  To me it seems like if the vaccine was working as good as advertised that CFR would be a lot closer to 0%, or at least below the .7%-2.3% CFR from the 'control'.

I've had a read on the HSE (official Irish government) website and can't see any major ones



**Efficiency:**

Pfizer - 95%
Moderna - 94%

**Side effects:**

Both appear to be practically the same too with negligible side effects. Although for both the HSE website mentions ""More than 1 in 10,000 people may develop Bell‚Äôs palsy""

BP is usually temporary as far as I know


**Other:**

Both have a 4 week gap for the second shot

With Pfizer you're good to go a week after this and Moderna is two weeks after

Happy days

**Indian variant:**

Quote:

The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna coronavirus vaccines appear to protect against COVID variants B.1.617 and B.1.618 first identified in India, researchers have reported in a new pre-print paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, CNN reported


More good news there

**Miscellaneous:**

Quote:

""New evidence from Israel shows the risk of severe COVID-19 was reduced by 92%, 7 days after 2 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine""

It's looking like almost all (if not all) 40-49 year olds in Ireland will get one of these two vaccines so I thought it'd be good to jump into the data

&gt; The Company is also announcing new positive interim Phase 1 data from its Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) vaccine candidate (mRNA-1345) 

&gt; Today, the Company is sharing the first interim analysis of the Phase 1 study of mRNA-1345, through 1-month post-vaccination, of the younger adult cohorts. A single mRNA-1345 vaccination of 50 Œºg (N=19) or 100 Œºg (N=20) was generally well-tolerated in younger adults (ages 18-49 years). Ten participants received placebo. The most common local solicited adverse reaction was injection site pain, and the most common systemic solicited adverse reactions were headache, fatigue and myalgia. The majority of solicited adverse reactions occurred within 1-3 days after vaccination and resolved after 1-4 days. There were no deaths, no severe adverse events, no study discontinuations due to adverse events, and no adverse events that led to a study pause.

&gt; mRNA-1345 was shown to increase RSV neutralizing antibodies in seropositive younger adults. Neutralizing antibodies were confirmed to be present at baseline in all participants, as expected. A single vaccination of mRNA-1345 at the 50 or 100 Œºg dose level boosted neutralizing antibody titers against both serotypes of RSV-A and RSV-B with no apparent dose response. At month 1, the geometric mean fold rise in neutralizing antibody relative to baseline was at least 20.5 for RSV-A and at least 11.7 for RSV-B.

&gt; At the 100 Œºg dose level, the geometric mean fold rise (95% CI) in RSV-A neutralizing antibody titer at month 1 relative to baseline was 2.7 (2.1, 3.4) with mRNA-1777, the Company‚Äôs previous RSV vaccine candidate, compared to 21.0 (13.9, 31.8) with mRNA-1345. Both mRNA-1777 and mRNA-1345 encode for the prefusion RSV-F.

[],,jdorje,,,,,,[],"Serial interval is the number of days between transmissions.  Say this was ALWAYS exactly 4 days, then with an R(t)=2 then every 4 days cases would double.  Every week, they'd rise by 2^7/4 = +236%.  Or if you want to reverse it, since we have cases dropping weekly to 76% of their previous value, you'd have R(t) = 0.76^4/7 = 0.855.

But where does that value of 4 come from?  What if it's 3.5, or 5, or 8 instead?  Then that math just completely changes.  The weekly change is a known value (though smoothed since we have cases coming in on certain days and lagging a while behind infections).  But the serial interval isn't really known, so we can't ""really"" know R(t) either.  This makes calculations like the herd immunity threshold difficult.  With a more complicated model you can come up with this in other ways; for instance if B.1.1.7 is a fixed amount more contagious than B.1 then you can adjust your serial interval until that amount is the same across all R(t) values found in different countries.

And it's actually far more complicated than that.  There's no reason to believe the serial interval is even a constant - it could vary greatly depending on how many people get sick leave, for instance.  And of course it's not a single value at all, but a distribution over time.  And the combined effect of that distribution is not the same as just taking an algebraic average - it's more like solving the Fibonacci series.

&gt; &gt;only two adverse events occurred within the J&amp;J group

&gt; ...you mean only two out of the three women who both received the vaccine and became pregnant, so a 66% chance of adverse effects? But these numbers are orders of magnitude too small to determine any kind of causal link here.

Very good point. I agree, the numbers are too small to determine anything.

&gt; What were the minimum ages included in the studies? This is my main point, the effects on children haven't been tested yet we're advocating en masse vaccination of children in a very short period of time.

Seems for Moderna it was 18 (page 20 in the document of the previous comment), for Pfizer it was 16 (page 20), and for J&amp;J it was 18 (page 21).

It seems there isn't a lot of data currently for infants and young children, however Pfizer did a phase 3 trial on participants aged 12-15, with 2,260 total participants. [They say side effects were consistent with those age 16+. They also still did the two month follow-up for the participants, however it seems they only monitored over half of the participants for that two month period instead of all the participants. Only 2,260 people were included in the study, versus the 43,651 total in the 16+ trial.](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use) Make of that information what you will. I'm just a teen so I'm not knowledgeable enough to speak much on it.

Moderna also stated in a [press release that in an initial analysis of a trial for those aged 12-17, that their vaccine showed 96% efficacy and no safety concerns identified to date. 3,235 people were enrolled in this trial, and they had a median safety follow-up of 35 days.](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-financial-results)

I hear Pfizer has started a phase 2 and 3 trial for ages six months to 11 years old, however I couldn't find a direct statement from Pfizer about it and I don't believe they've released the information from those trials yet. They may still be monitoring the participants right now if they have administered the doses already. 

I believe the US has still been monitoring children aged 12-15 who have gotten the Pfizer vaccine for safety, and they have not seen any major issues propping up yet. To speak to how precise their monitoring systems are, the government was able to detect a blood clotting issue that affected 6 people with the J&amp;J vaccine, and put a hold on that vaccine until they found a way to identify and treat it, so I assume if there were issues now they would have detected them already. Seems their safety monitoring systems are quite precise if they can detect a 6 in several million occurrence (I'm not sure exactly how many people got the J&amp;J vaccine when they detected those cases).",,,1621920896,{},gzd045q,False,t3_nj6me5,False,True,t1_gzcldev,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nj6me5/faced_with_antivaccination_parents_teens_are/gzd045q/,1622006553,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_4yo4boi1,False,False,,

[],,AdministrativePilot3,,,,,,[],"Seychelles is the world leader in terms of the number of vaccinated people. Nevertheless, the number of cases of coronavirus infections is increasing rapidly on the islands. Do vaccines fail?

  
Almost 62 percent residents of the country vaccinated with two doses of the vaccine and a total of more than 70 percent. those after at least one dose. With these numbers, Seychelles, an island nation in the Indian Ocean and a popular tourist destination, has become the world leader in vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 . In this respect, they were ahead of three other countries on the list: Israel, Great Britain and the United Arab Emirates.  
There are two sources of this success. First of all, the Seychelles managed to obtain a Chinese vaccine from Sinopharm and the preparation of AstraZeneca, produced in India under the name Covishield. Secondly, the operation was easier to carry out as the population of these paradise islands is less than 99,000. For comparison: the average daily number of vaccinations against covid-19 in the last seven days in Poland is approx. 300 thousand. daily. More than a third of those infected are vaccinated. Apparently, however, the Seychelles have fallen victim to its own success. 

&amp;#x200B;

When it turned out that the number of vaccinated people is the fastest in the world, there was a lot of relaxation, the media reported. The results did not take long to come about - in May the number of cases of coronavirus infection skyrocketed from several dozen to over 300 cases a day (in total, there were almost 10,000 infections since the beginning of the pandemic, 35 people died, and the current number of infected is over more than 300). 1.9 thousand). 

&amp;#x200B;

**That is why Seychelles have recently appeared in global news services, especially since - as reported by the local health ministry - as much as 37 percent. People infected are those who have received two doses of the vaccine. So what is going on in this tourist paradise? Has any new vaccine-resistant variant of SARS-CoV-2 emerged? Or maybe the preparations that were supposed to protect against the coronavirus are not as effective as the data show so far? The answer to both questions is no.** 

**First of all - we do not have complete data on what happened in Seychelles. For example, it is not known how many of the people vaccinated with two doses and yet infected with the coronavirus received the Chinese vaccine and how many received AstraZeneka, because there may be some differences in the effectiveness of the two preparations.** 

**It is known, however, that in the group of fully vaccinated 57 percent. got a Sinopharm preparation, which was administered to residents aged 18 to 60 years, and 43 percent. Covishield, which was given to Seychelles over 60 years of age. Read also: Brazil questions the quality of Sputnik V, Russians are furious Another question mark: Seychelles authorities have not yet revealed how many days after vaccination infected people caught the infection. Perhaps after receiving two injections, they stopped being cautious, even though it takes some time to develop immunity to the coronavirus (in the case of AstraZeneca, 15 days after the second dose).** 

&amp;#x200B;

The age profile of the infected / vaccinated is also unknown, as is which virus variant is widespread on the islands (possibly South African). Vaccines effectively protect against severe covid. If indeed a lot of people stopped protecting themselves shortly after receiving the second injection, even these 37 percent. the infected / vaccinated should come as no surprise.

 In addition, AstraZeneca shows (according to the manufacturer's data) 76 percent. effectiveness in protection against symptomatic covid-19 and 100 percent. against severe disease and hospitalization, and Sinopharm protects at the level of 79%. before symptomatic infection or hospitalization. 

&amp;#x200B;

**This means - as Prof. Michael Z. Lin from Stanford University - that about 20 percent. of the population will remain vulnerable to the coronavirus, even if all people in a country are vaccinated. Also read: Covid and scream pill? Pfizer is blazing the trail The fact that vaccines are doing their job well in the Seychelles is also demonstrated by the following fact: although 20 percent of the people who were hospitalized because of covid-19 were fully vaccinated, but their cases turned out to be mild and no one died. On the other hand, almost all seriously ill people are unvaccinated, additionally burdened with comorbidities.**

&amp;#x200B;

 It was in this spirit that Dr Kate O'Brien, a representative of the World Health Organization (WHO), which monitors the situation in the Seychelles and is expected to provide more detailed information on this subject, spoke a week ago. ‚ÄúVaccines are very effective there against severe cases and deaths. Most of the reported cases of the disease are mild, and some of the reported infections occur either shortly after a single dose, or immediately after the second dose, or between the first and second doses ""- said the expert.

Israel wins against the coronavirus pandemic The fact that vaccines are all right so far is also shown by examples from other countries, especially Israel. As you can read in the latest issue of Science, the country has seen a spectacular over 100-fold decline in documented new infections over the past three months and a more than fifty-fold decline in severe covid-19 cases. And this despite the gradual lifting of restrictions. Most likely, this is due to the vaccination campaign (almost 60 percent. Israelis received both doses of vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna), not due to the seasonality of the coronavirus or the lockdown.

The decline in severe covid-19 cases first manifested among the elderly (the earliest vaccinated group) and only a few weeks later in the younger, mostly unvaccinated age groups. By the end of March, over 55 percent. daily deaths occurred in a small (less than 1.6%) subgroup of unvaccinated adults over 60 years of age. Read more: Vaccinations make sense. Israel is leading and coming back to life Do not repeat Seychelles' mistakes **Many reports on the situation in the Seychelles say that this island country can be a warning to others, what happens when people lose their caution despite mass vaccinations. This is a particularly important lesson for the easing of the restrictions of our country. Especially since in Poland only less than 12 percent have received two doses of the vaccine. population.

What you said, the message I cited, implies that the WHO had a limited time to investigate, as in they would be not allowed to investigate the issue for more than a year.

Should have written:

&gt;Why, for more than a year, was the Chinese government not allowing the WHO in to examine?

Well, that's about all I had to say about that.

On another topic, the lab hypothesis still has so little evidence supporting it that we can still say it's a hypothesis. While of course it is hard to pinpoint it's origin, SARS2 RNA is almost 90% identical RNA to that of some bat coronaviruses.

Considering the safety measures in place for any biological lab and considering the safety measures humans have while interacting with wildlife... I'm not putting my bets on the lab thing. More so because infected bats are asymptomatic since the virus doesn't really affect them. They don't look sick, people don't think that they're sick when handling them.

That's why I bring up that fallacy.

The fact that Wuhan has a lab that researches coronaviruses is not a piece of evidence so it means and adds to the conversation absolutely nothing. Unless you want to start blaming higher incidence of cancer of people living near telecommunication towers compared to before there were towers and think it's a valid argument.

A concern is valid enough to prompt an investigation such as the one that took place, but is not nearly enough to make an energetic assertion.",,,1621927810,{},gzd8nfy,False,t3_nk3vlk,False,True,t1_gzd37p7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nk3vlk/dr_fauci_says_hes_not_convinced_covid19_developed/gzd8nfy/,1622011261,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_1775mz,False,False,,

[],,ZedZeroth,,,,,,[],"Thanks again for all the information. The fact you're researching and interpreting all this at your age is commendable. I'd summarise my thoughts into two main points. 

1. For you personally, I think the risk of vaccine side effects to be extremely low. The risks of covid are hopefully very low too but this is another unknown. I doubt it matters (medically) directly to you whether you get vaccinated or not, but it might matter to the older people around you and in your community in general.

2. My original point was what I feel is a misuse (not by you, but by many) of the term anti-vaxxer. By applying this to parents who are wary of giving their children a covid vaccine, we're diluting its meaning. We're both misjudging educated people with genuine concerns, while simultaneously downplaying the ignorance of the ""real"" anti-vaxxers.

I've come across this in other areas too. It's a bad habit people have of turning everything into ""black and white"" / ""them vs us"" scenarios, and we all know that the world doesn't really work like that. For example, if you challenge the developmental stage at which abortion is legal, that doesn't make you a pro-lifer. The cutoff point is a genuine ethical issue that needs continual discussion and revision. Likewise, if you query whether genes from GM organisms could cause problems if transferred into natural ecosystems, that doesn't make you anti-GM,  it's a genuine risk that needs continual monitoring.

If I was your age I'd probably get vaccinated. Whether I'm going to vaccinate my four-year-old, who likely has no direct risk from covid and no understanding or ability to give consent, very unlikely any time soon.  If that makes me an anti-vaxxer well then I guess there's suddenly a lot of scientists and doctors joining the club this year...",,,1621927541,{},gzd8cn5,False,t3_nj6me5,False,True,t1_gzd045q,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nj6me5/faced_with_antivaccination_parents_teens_are/gzd8cn5/,1622011100,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_15xhrr,False,False,,

They also found that a high proportion of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection met clinical and diagnostic criteria for thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). TMA is a syndrome that involves clotting in the small blood vessels and has been identified as a potential cause for severe manifestations of COVID-19 in adults.

Anti vaxxers try to frame this as a difference of opinion because it does several things. 1) it puts someones whackadoo opinion with no backing evidence on the same playing field as a team of scientists' decades of work to find supporting evidence for their claims.  2) it shifts the battle from evaluating two claims only on their merits  to evaluating whether one side is  unfairly being stifled by the other side and not being allowed to have an opinion, which is frankly just an easier bad faith argument to win. If you fought anti vax propaganda on just its merits it would lose, easily, everytime.  

 Vaccination efficacy is not an opinion.  It is science backed by tons of peer reviewed research across countries.    The evidence is freely and readily available to anyone who bothers to look. The methods used have been vetted by other professionals in the field across multiple countries.  Anyone is free to refute this provided they have research to back their claims.  This belief that somehow vaccine efficacy is just one opinion out of many is... just wrong. Science isn't an opinion, it's either backed by research or disproven by research. It's iterative and builds on itself. It's fine to say science right now doesn't have a 100% complete picture of how vaccines affect everyone and even to worry about the fact there might be some side effect that isn't fully known. But your concerns shouldn't govern policy and shouldn't carry the same weight as the research done to show that vaccines are largely effective and safe UNLESS you provide compelling research to show otherwise. Your free to have the opinion that you are the best and safest driver in the world while inebriated. but your opinion shouldn't carry more weight than the research that shows it's in the public's best interests to have drunk driving laws.",,,1621959811,{},gzeo4h4,False,t3_nkpi85,False,False,t1_gzeexi8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nkpi85/soldier_who_called_on_troops_to_refuse_vaccine/gzeo4h4/,1622041441,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],[],text,t2_gc7vv,False,False,,

\- A mRNA vaccine is incapable of changing your DNA. That is impossible for three reasons.  
  
DNA in a cell is housed in the nucleus. In order to access the nucleus the vaccine would need to pass though the nuclear membrane. To do that, the vaccine would need a nuclear access signal (which it doesn't have). No signal means that it is biologically impossible for the vaccine to enter your nucleus and interact with your DNA.  
  
DNA and RNA are separate languages. Let's suppose that the vaccine somehow did the biologically impossible and managed to sneak though a nuclear membrane. In that situation the RNA from the vaccine would be incapable of communicating with the DNA of your cell. RNA and DNA are completely different languages. For DNA and RNA to communicate with each other a ""translator"" reverse transcription enzyme would need to be used. The vaccine does not have this enzyme in it and therefore it is impossible for vaccine RNA to communicate with cellular DNA.  
  
RNA cannot integrate with DNA without integrase. If biological impossibility 1 and 2 happened, the vaccine RNA would still be incapable of integrating with your DNA.

I use to see wear mask forever as a straw man, but lately I‚Äôve been waning on that.

I would be on this side as well, but it's impractical since many governments are just completely dropping the mask mandate altogether, and bad faith actors who aren't vaccinated will not follow CDC guidelines to wear a mask to protect other unvaccinated people.  Perhaps if we had vaccine passports and some authorities to enforce mask mandates on the unvaccinated it would work, but right now it seems like there's no good way to protect those that can't be vaccinated from those that refuse to be vaccinated.

When I'm at work or at home and have other vaccinated people over, I don't worry about COVID at all despite having unvaccinated children.  It's just not realistic.  However, that also means that I won't let my kids stop wearing masks out in public, and we're still limiting a lot of their public interactions as a result of COVID (which is still going around among children in my area as the majority of adults in my county are fully vaccinated and a higher number have at least one dose.)

In total on Tuesday, the Ministry of Health registered 447 new infections nationwide, the biggest increase since the pandemic began.  
  
Of those, three are imported cases and the remaining are 28 from B·∫Øc Ninh Province, 23 from H√† N·ªôi, seven from L·∫°ng S∆°n City, five from H√† Nam Province, two from ƒê√† N·∫µng City, and one from Th√°i B√¨nh, ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n, the Cancer Hospital (K) Hospital and HCM City respectively.  
  
All cases in H√† N·ªôi are related to the confirmed positive case from Spica Company and ƒê√¨nh Tr√°m Industrial Zone in B·∫Øc Giang Province. They had been quarantined previously.  
  
All cases in B·∫Øc Giang Province are from the Quang Ch√¢u, V√¢n Trung, and Song Kh√™-N·ªôi Ho√†ng industrial zones.  
  
Speaking at an urgent virtual meeting on Tuesday, Minister of Health Nguy·ªÖn Thanh Long said the new strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus and the high density of workers in the industrial zones sharing bathrooms and canteens led to the record number.  
  
From B·∫Øc Giang Province, Deputy Minister of Health Nguy·ªÖn Tr∆∞·ªùng S∆°n said the number of new cases would certainly rise in the coming days.  
  
L√™ √Ånh D∆∞∆°ng, Chairman of B·∫Øc Giang People's Committee reported more than 12,600 people had been in close contact with the confirmed positive cases and needed to be quarantined.  
  
In the past three days, the province has focused on large-scale testing. Notably, the ratio of F1 negative to positive was very high.  
  
At Shin Young Company, the first firm in V√¢n Trung industrial park to detect infection cases, the rate of patients from negative to positive was 79 per cent. This rate at Hosiden Company in Quang Ch√¢u industrial zone was 55 per cent.  
  
There were 18 cases of community transmissions in residential areas, but all were related to infected workers. Three more cases of medical staff on duty were reported.  
  
D∆∞∆°ng said the province had prepared a capacity of 2,627 hospital beds and a field hospital with the capacity of 620 beds located at the provincial gymnasium.  
  
At the meeting, Long asked the ministry‚Äôs special department in B·∫Øc Giang Province to develop a scenario in case there are more than 3,000 new cases and to actively respond to the situation.  
  
‚ÄúThe priority is to stamp out the pandemic in B·∫Øc Giang Province so that it will not spread to neighbouring provinces and cities,‚Äù he said.  
  
‚ÄúThe urgent tasks that need to be implemented right now are to re-evaluate all risks of all districts, not only the four isolated districts under the Government‚Äôs Directive 16, and apply social distancing if needed.‚Äù   
  
Areas where workers are living such as My ƒêi·ªÅn and N√∫i Hi·ªÉu villages must be locked down. Quick testing must be conducted for all residents in the surrounding areas every three days and PCR testing every week. Testing points must be set up to collect and return results to local people instead of sending samples to the authorised agencies and centres.  
  
The provincial CDC reported more than 50,000 people in the high-risk group that had still not been tested.  
  
Long said these people needed to get quick testing on the spot instead of waiting for PCR testing. Those who were negative to the virus must be quarantined and wait for PCR testing after seven days.  
  
Deputy Minister S∆°n will be in charge of the pandemic situation in B·∫Øc Giang and make decisions in urgent circumstances without having to wait for the Prime Minister's approval.""

The amount of information available regarding the effectiveness and safety of these vaccines is S-T-A-G-G-E-R-I-N-G. I can tell that people haven't done their research when they tell me ""these were rushed, and that we don't have enough data!!"" by asking them how the mRNA or even the J&amp;J vaccine work. Since they can't even usually tell me the basics, it tells me they are talking out their ass. It doesn't take a lot of time to research and READ the basics. But, not surprised, most people don't even know how their credit score works or how to read their closing disclosure when buying a house (you know, MAJOR life things but people spend no time understanding).

As for the general situation in China, here's something I posted a few days ago based on leaked CCP documents:

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/30/asia/wuhan-china-covid-intl/index.html

Has a weirdly negative spin on the data considering the contents, but tl;dr leaked internal documents from the CCP, shows regular levels of incompetence and sub-optimal practises that were common for covid at the time, but not really anything paticularly malicious. 

""However, though the documents provide no evidence of a deliberate attempt to obfuscate findings, they do reveal numerous inconsistencies in what authorities believed to be happening and what was revealed to the public.""

""The documents, which cover an incomplete period between October 2019 and April this year, reveal what appears to be an inflexible health care system constrained by top-down bureaucracy and rigid procedures that were ill-equipped to deal with the emerging crisis. At several critical moments in the early phase of the pandemic, the documents show evidence of clear missteps and point to a pattern of institutional failings.""

""Conversely, however, the leaked documents also provide something of a defense of China's overall handling of the virus.

[],,greypowerOz,,,,,,[],"this is a PRO VACCINATION person. The title is click bait. 

He's saying the idea that ""once xx % has been vaccinated, we have _herd immunity_ "" is not a good way to frame this issue.

I don't know if the title is intentionally misleading or innocently badly phrased.

-------------------------------


&gt;Q. What would be *****a fair rate to say we have reached***** herd immunity?

&gt;A. If we were dealing with a virus that doesn‚Äôt change, then the mathematicians could work out ***what proportion of the population has to be vaccinated in order to stop the virus in its tracks***. 

&gt;So, herd immunity is when you can really stop circulation just by vaccinating enough people. We know for measles that you need over 95% of people vaccinated. For some other viruses, it may only be 80% or 75%.


&gt;But for this virus, it is changing. So herd immunity for the original strain last year would have been possible. But we‚Äôre now dealing with different variants, which will continue to emerge and transmit in vaccinated populations. 

&gt;I think we should forget herd immunity. It‚Äôs the wrong concept because of the variants.

&gt; The virus will find ways of transmitting in immune populations. In a sense, the real question is what proportion of people need to be vaccinated, that will minimize the number of people going to the hospital, or maybe even stop it completely.

 &gt;I think it is actually a very high proportion of the population who are at risk and need to be vaccinated. And the difficulty is that even if you vaccinated everyone over the age of 50, that will stop 99% of the hospitalizations. But then, if we give up at that point, then younger adults, the under-50s, will still get the disease. And because there‚Äôs so many of them in all of our countries, some of those people will be vulnerable and will go into hospital.

&gt;It is a difficult one balancing the requirement to try to minimize hospitalizations. Once you‚Äôve vaccinated the over-50s, the next step in programs, hopefully when most of the world is protected, is going to be to start to vaccinate wider in the under-50s.",,,1621896751,{},gzbt656,False,t3_njyid4,False,False,t3_njyid4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/njyid4/we_should_forget_about_herd_immunity_its_the/gzbt656/,1621981639,14,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_nrhzj,False,True,,

However, it should be noted that scientists (in the area of airflow) knew that some transmission via aerosols was happening and they were ignored rather rudely in favor of a constant (5 microns) that no-one knew where it came from. The WHO panel was unwilling to listen to them or research the issue more fully. They in fact cut them off citing this 5 micron constant as criteria for what's considered airborne.

As it turns out, most of the respiratory viruses have some level of aersol transmission. It's fairly obvious that flu transmits that way as well. Of course these viruses also transmit via droplets and surfaces, but the five micron constant was just accepted as fact with no room for argument. There was no common sense in that if course there's nuance, as droplets of larger size can be suspended in air, just for shorter time periods. In fact flu viruses have long been found in areas they should not be if the prevailing wisdom were true (like air vents for example). Yet no-one questioned the prevailing wisdom as they should have.

The lesson here is that we shouldn't just accept constants as fact without understanding the context. The WHO panel and the CDC were guilty of accepting an old data point as fact without first understanding the full context of the study that produced it. The only thing that convinced them was a group of determined people researching the origin of that number and plainly showing that it was false.

&gt;	A recent study found that 13.3 per cent of adults with symptomatic covid-19 have symptoms lasting more than 28 days (medRxiv, doi.org/ghgdsv).

And

&gt;	Evidence from the first study of long covid in children suggests that more than half of children aged between 6 and 16 years old who contract the virus have at least one symptom lasting more than 120 days, with 42.6 per cent impaired by these symptoms during daily activities. These interim results are based on periodic assessments of 129 children in Italy who were diagnosed with covid-19 between March and November 2020 at the Gemelli University Hospital in Rome (medRxiv, doi.org/fv9t).

These numbers are wild.  But even if it‚Äôs true, OP‚Äôs original statement of 10-30% of kids infected experiencing symptoms for 6 months is incorrect.

First quote:  13.3% of **adults** with **symptomatic** covid experience them for over 28 days (let alone 6 months).

Is the article trying to say kids are at higher risk for greatly longer symptoms from covid than adults?  I haven‚Äôt heard even a whisper of that anywhere else‚Ä¶and it would be a HUGE deal if true.

The second quote is based on a study of kids diagnosed in a hospital.  A sample of kids that have been taken to a hospital can‚Äôt be equated to kids as a whole.

I have empathy for parents and what they need to consider right now.  I‚Äôm not one of those people who got vaccinated and doesn‚Äôt give a shit about other people now.

I‚Äôm just saying throwing out an outlandish claim that 10-30% of kids who are infected get sick for 6 months is extremely reckless.  We need to make decisions based on the best information possible.  

I‚Äôll throw out another quote from the second link because it‚Äôs just too much

&gt;	UK advocacy group Long Covid Kids says that it currently has details of 1200 children with long covid from 890 families in England. ‚ÄúAnd that number has been rising quickly,‚Äù says founder Sammie Mcfarland. ‚ÄúNot one has returned to their previous health, and most are unable to do their normal activities.‚Äù

**Not one has returned to their previous health?? Really??**

IMO an article that would even consider including a ridiculous quote like that should be dismissed entirely.",,,1621967257,{},gzf5h9r,False,t3_nkd1qn,False,True,t1_gzevjeh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nkd1qn/most_children_with_postcovid_disease_recover/gzf5h9r/,1622053099,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_4ip66,False,False,,

For example, a 10% reduction in mobility was associated with a 17.5% reduction in case growth two weeks later.

R values are going to be different for each different strain.  We don't actually know which lineages are different strains (versus simply variants).  R(t) is certainly much less than 1 for B.1.1.7 and B.1.526 which account for the large majority of cases in the country.  R(t) may be near to 1 but is probably below for P.1.  R(t) may still be above 1, possibly well above 1, for B.1.617.2, but there aren't enough cases of this for it to matter for some time.  Of course we know that vaccines are basically fully effective against all current lineages, so dealing with more contagious lineages just means vaccinating more people.

The actual R(t) depends on the serial interval between transmissions which is just guessed at (the CDC has a study that shows an algebraic average of 3.96, for instance - but the algebraic average isn't actually the relevant value here sadly).  But weekly growth is a great proxy.  We're currently at -24% per week; at that pace we're something like 6 weeks away from 10k cases a day (an arbitrary but reasonable milestone for the end of the pandemic).  However that pace of shrinking is accelerating so it might be faster (we are still vaccinating 3-4% of the unvaccinated per week, dropping R(t) by a similar amount after whatever delay period).

In the best case scenario, local transmissions will go to 0 for any R(t)&lt;1 value everywhere in the US, but we'll still get a steady trickle of imported cases for the next months at least.  This could look like a plateau, but it would be such a tiny one we wouldn't care.

Probably because the actual threat to children is statistically not large enough to warrant the continued shut down of the world.


&gt;	If you‚Äôre a decent person capable of some sort of empathy for other people, maybe you can consider chilling out until we‚Äôre actually able to get kids vaccinated.

More appeals to emotions. Instead of sticking to facts and logic, you want to use this fallacy to convince others. I wonder why that is?

If you have any food that you bought last year for Covid lockdown/emergencies/etc., now is the time to eat it or donate it to a food pantry. If it's expired, eat it or toss it instead of donating it please.  If you want to be prepared for future emergencies, go ahead and buy more to replace it, I guess.

If you're an American and you've been waiting for your turn to get vaccinated, it's your turn.

If you are vaccinated, it's your turn to help other people get vaccinated. 

If you have a strategy to get older Americans vaccinated, please spread the word. 

I think we need to get to the point where we can get hospitals back to normal operation and get family doctors/GP's doses to give out like they do with the flu vaccine. And like tons of extra doses. Novavax should help here.

The vaccines are FREE in the US.  FREE FREE, not like ""Copay free"", like fuckin FREE.  Go get one. Now.  Is there something stopping you from going to get one today? Talk to me about it, we'll get it worked out.

**More variant stuff:**

There [might not be much room left for SARS-CoV-2 to mutate](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/mpcc5k/weekly_question_thread_april_12_2021/gui5xn3/) into.

This does not occur with the vaccines.

[Fewer symptoms = less spread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6sj6g/daily_discussion_thread_may_07_2021/gxbfbt1/)  Vaccines make you have fewer symptoms (*if* you get an infection after vaccination).

From the [NYT:](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/health/cdc-masks-vaccines-variants.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article) 
&gt;Introducing the new recommendations on Thursday, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the C.D.C. director, cited two recent scientific findings as significant factors: Few vaccinated people become infected with the virus, and transmission seems rarer still; and the vaccines appear to be effective against all known variants of the coronavirus. 

Remember, if you got infected, recovered, and then got at least one dose of Pfizer, you have immunity not only to multiple variants, but also SARS-CoV-1, the virus for which we named SARS in 2003.  Turns out much of [the ""breadth"" of that immunity is from the vaccine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/net65c/sarscov2_mrna_vaccines_induce_a_greater_array_of/)

Today's thinking:

US : 

Children don't seem spread the virus as effectively as adults. 

We have okay vaccination numbers and lots of natural immunity.

Adults spread the virus much more effectively than children. But that's good news. About half of the people above 11 are vaccinated, and many have natural immunity. 

So yes, children are vulnerable to infection, but they don't tend to be superspreaders. Most people who were going to get infected and cause spread have already done so, or have been vaccinated. Now, there are still tons of people who could be infected left. So, I need help with some math :

What is the additional value of vaccinating one additional older person vs a younger person? If you vaccinate a young person, you are only protecting that person. If you vaccinate an old person, you are probably preventing spread.",,,1621945380,{},gzdtm8b,False,t3_nkjgm5,False,False,t3_nkjgm5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nkjgm5/daily_discussion_thread_may_25_2021/gzdtm8b/,1622022781,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_74gdvg9l,False,True,,

So why should unvaccinated people not be able to meet with their friends for a walk or a drink outside, given that their meeting does not seem to cause significant spread of the virus?

Why would I not want to get a vaccine? I absolutely do, it's just that they're limited in the UK by age range. All being well, I may be able to get one next week. People younger than me may have to wait up to 2 more months.

My point is that the vaccination programme requires young people to be on board with the UK plan, which has involved excluding young people from vaccination for more than 6 months. If you also think that young people should accept not being able to go for a walk with a friend, you are seriously undermining trust in the healthcare system and in the rules which govern movement at the moment.

Moderna said on Tuesday that its coronavirus vaccine, authorized only for use in adults, was powerfully effective in 12- to 17-year-olds, and that it planned to apply to the Food and Drug Administration in June for authorization to use the vaccine in adolescents.

If approved, its vaccine would become the second Covid-19 vaccine available to U.S. adolescents. Federal regulators authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine this month for 12- to 15-year-olds.

The Pfizer shot was initially authorized for use in people 16 and older, while Moderna‚Äôs has been available for those 18 and up.

Proof of the vaccines‚Äô efficacy and safety for adolescents is helping school officials and other leaders as they plan for the fall. On Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that all public school students in New York City, the largest school system in the United States, would return to in-person learning in the fall.

New York‚Äôs move comes as several states have indicated that they will restrict remote learning, including Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Jersey.

The Moderna results, which the company announced in a statement, are based on a clinical trial that enrolled 3,732 people ages 12 to 17, two-thirds of whom received two vaccine doses. There were no cases of symptomatic Covid-19 in fully vaccinated adolescents, the company reported. That translates to an efficacy of 100 percent, the same figure that Pfizer and BioNTech reported in a trial of their vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds.

‚ÄúThese look like promising results,‚Äù said Dr. Kristin Oliver, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. ‚ÄúThe more vaccines we have to protect adolescents from Covid, the better.‚Äù

Moderna also reported that a single dose of its vaccine had 93 percent efficacy against symptomatic disease.

‚ÄúThose cases that did occur between the two doses were mild, which is also a good indicator of protection against disease,‚Äù Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease epidemiologist at George Mason University, said in an email.

The side effects were consistent with what has been reported in adults: pain at the site of the injection, headache, fatigue, muscle pain and chills. ‚ÄúNo significant safety concerns have been identified to date,‚Äù the company said.

The adolescents in the study will be monitored for a year after their second dose.

The results were announced in a news release that did not contain detailed data from the clinical trial. And Dr. Rasmussen said that the vaccines‚Äô efficacy can be trickier to evaluate in children, who are less likely to develop symptomatic disease than adults.

Nevertheless, she said, the results are in line with what scientists expected and suggest ‚Äúthat adolescents respond to the vaccine comparably to adults who receive it.‚Äù

I‚Äôve seen quotes from certain officials (I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt remember who exactly, possibly Peter marks from fda but maybe somebody who remembers can step in a correct me or verify) that in the case of these vaccines, it‚Äôs almost all about how long they work. Which to me means we could perhaps see full approval in the fall (when they can verify that they work for at least a full year). To my knowledge, only Pfizer has actually applied for approval, but I‚Äôm sure moderna and j&amp;j aren‚Äôt far behind.

Putting kids back *in* school is a whole other thing. A lot of people pushed for it not for the kids' educational benefit, but to get the national economy back in gear. 

Implementation of both remote and in person learning has been...ugh. Like, I could go off about this at length (and have) but suffice to say a lot of the studies they used to declare in person learning 'safe' were a little...uh, look, they were using data from schools with 5% in-person learning and extrapolating that to schools with much higher in person learning. Also, in my area, they didn't adjust anything about protocol in response to new strains or new information about transmission (airborne vs surfaces). 

ALSO, and this is the one that really gets me, we can't just talk about transmission rates 'for kids in school' as if they are a single homogenous group. Transmission rates are low in elementary school aged kids, yes, but older kids (middle and high school) can spread covid at the same rates as adults. 

Kids have totally been used as pawns in both senses of the word: As bargaining chips AND sacrifices.

[],,renegadellama,,,,,,[],"I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic. I'm definitely not anti-vaxx and was jealous when my mom was able to get Pfizer as early as January. I've taken the Pandemic seriously and was already social distancing Feb. 2020. My worries were that the vaccine was developed too fast and that governments were prioritizing the economy over people. 

I think everyone had their breaking point with self-isolation and I finally started to work up in the courage in April. By that point, I had researched all three vaccines in-depth and decided on Pfizer for the lower chance of side effects. I used all the vaccine spotter tools to finally grab an appointment for Pfizer but the day before my first dose, the J&amp;J pause happened and I panicked/canceled. 

In order to combat the anticipatory anxiety, I decided to wait until walk-ins became a thing. That way the day I decided I was ready, I could just go do it. My city organized a giant vaccine drive-thru with all 3 vaccines. The day I finally decided I was ready, I drove to the vaccination site and was told they were holding Pfizer back for the kids. I spent an agonizing 20 minutes in my car trying to decide what to do. It felt like now or never. I knew Moderna had a higher chance of side effects but with my anxiety, with J&amp;J, I probably would have thought every little thing was a blood clot. So I went with Moderna.

I had a ton of side effects and felt pretty crummy for the first 72 hours. My arm felt fine the first 4 hours but after that it was very sore and tender. I had trouble putting shirts on and just exercising my arm was extremely painful. I was very fatigued. I had trouble sitting up at my desk and focusing on my work. I would just lay in bed and listen to podcasts. I tried going for a walk day 1 and day 2 after the vaccine and nearly fainted each time. Best way to describe it was like trying to go for a walk with a fever. 

Either day 1 or day 2 post vaccine I also woke up with extreme lower back pain. I already have a bad back, so it was hard to tell if I slept wrong or if it was the vaccine. The weird thing about the lower back pain was that it would come and go. I saw other people's stories with lower back pain with both Pfizer and Moderna, so I definitely think it was the vaccine. 

Once I regained mobility in my arm, I also noticed armpit tenderness which has been documented and is even in Moderna's FDA briefing. I'm 9 days post vaccination and feel ~ 95% back to normal. And wow does it feel like a long 9 days. I'm very conflicted on getting the second dose since the first is supposed to be at least 80% effective, which is higher than J&amp;J. Everyone says the second dose is worse, so I'm thinking about what I went through times ten.

I'm not writing this to fear monger Moderna. I'm glad I have at least 1 dose and some protection. I guess this is my response to all the Moderna (I just had a sore arm) people saying that we are overdoing it.

&gt; According to the specialist, the origin is still unknown, but it was first identified in Mococa, in the interior of Sao Paulo, and has high circulation in Porto Ferreira.

&gt; It is not yet possible to know if the variant is more contagious or dangerous than the 'common' virus.

&gt; New variant
&gt; Earlier this month, the L452R mutation in the S protein, which is also present in the Indian variant of the new coronavirus, was identified in samples from Descalvado and Porto Ferreira. However, it was still not possible to say whether it was a new variant or an existing one.

&gt; According to the researcher, the analyses of the university were submitted to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), an international initiative of open access to information on genomes of influenza viruses and coronaviruses. The group then made the designation of the name P.4.

&gt; ""This new variant is a relative of P.1, because it has the same origin, the origin is B.1.1.28, which is a lineage that gave rise to P.1, P.2, which was identified in Rio de Janeiro, P.3, which was identified in the Philippines. And now P.4 has been identified, which origin is still unknown, but it was first recognized in eastern Sao Paulo, first in Mococa, then we saw a high frequency of it in the city of Porto Ferreira, where we concentrated our study,"" said the researcher.

&gt; Also according to Ara√∫jo J√∫nior, the recognition of the new variant is important, as it shows that it is on the rise. There is still no information about the behaviour of the variant.

&gt; ""It is in an environment where P.1 predominates, where the British variant predominates as well, but it is rising with a frequency that worries us a lot. So, this was recognized by GISAID and now, with this name, we will be able to better monitor how it will spread and we almost beg the competent health bodies to look more carefully for this region, so we can minimize the transmission of this variant P.4 to other regions, as happened with the variant P.1, ""said the researcher.

I get that some states are never going to hit that because...I mean...you know why. In those states, it might be reasonable to base decisions on numbers of new cases and set a target that indicated that the circulating pool of covid was low enough to present less of a risk.

Obviously states in general need to do what is appropriate based on their numbers of deaths/new cases/vaccination rates. 

It's just been frustrating to see states like mine (that at the time of the CDC announcement had new cases numbers that were above the national average and increasing and had a full vaccination rate hovering around 35%) say ""Woohoo! Problem solved!"" and abandon mask mandates. Our new case numbers that week were as high as they were last November when everybody was wringing their hands and saying ""Something must be done about these alarming numbers!""

Of the symptoms we understand well, it is the fatigue and inability to focus that are my primary concerns. In the early years of their lives, kids are constantly learning, even before they start school. An inability to focus or fatigue lasting several months could significantly delay the development of younger kids. Looking across the whole population, if we see COVID-19 continuing to spread among children we could see a generation of children with significant developmental delays.

Does that risk justify requiring masks in all public places? Maybe not, as there are some businesses where they are very impractical and where kids do not frequently go, like gyms. However, there are plenty of venues where masks do not seriously hinder anyone and where families frequently gather. Places like movie theaters and grocery stores.

I think we'll have to agree to disagree on this.  I have particularly strong feelings on the direction you would want to take this.  We did have a child go down the road of emancipation for all the wrong reasons (as in: they don't let me just do whatever the f*k I want) and even tried to get us in trouble with CPS by claiming abuse (which wasn't true) and of course that went no where.  I take his current occupation of a jail cell to be evidence enough that the child does not always know best.  

&gt; Fuck, the kids should be allowed to sue for alimony. ... If parents are endangering their kids like that, they should have their wages garnished and given to the kids for the rest of their lives.

And this... what you're suggesting here is to build a system whereby children could simply claim lifelong support from a parent and never achieve any sort of independence of their own.  Parental abuse happens and should be dealt with of course, but a child needs to own their fate at some point and start taking responsibility.
