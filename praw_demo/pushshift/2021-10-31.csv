Also, it's important to remember that, if 100% of people are vaccinated, then 100% of deaths will be among vaccinated people. I would hope, and someone who knows more data than me or is more patient can maybe expand on this, that what happens is that total deaths will be going down because fewer will die after people are vaccinated. That is, if a 1000 unvaccinated people caught COVID, then 10 people would die. If a 1000 vaccinated people caught COVID, then I'd think that about 2 would die. 

Of course, the people who were vaccinated and their issues would play into that. People who have had the vaccine who are immunocompromised benefit less from the vaccines and are more likely to die if they get sick because of their bodies diminished ability to develop immunity and age would factor into this as well. 

The article mentions early vaccination and waning resistance, but I'd also guess that delta has something to do with how things are playing out.

Then a vaccine was developed based on that, it was much safer and we didn't need to carry a sick cow to perform the variolation.

Since you're too lazy to check your own sources, this is what the CFR looks like per age group. Deaths for the 0-17 subgroups aren't broken out, it's 558 for 0-17 combined.

            Cases   Deaths  CFR
    0-4     913472	558	      0%
    5-11    1947493           0%
    12-15   1555870           0%
    16-17   992246            0%
    18-29   7905428	4156    0.1%
    30-39   5991815	12217   0.2%

    85+     708670  198648  28.0%
    Total   36092177 736875 2.0%

So if you're under 50 you have a 0.6% chance of dying, but most of these numbers are pre-delta; the death rate for delta is higher for younger age groups. Once you hit 50 the death rate jumps to over 1%. For reference, an average flu season has a 0.1% CFR across all age groups so COVID is much more deadly and more contagious than the average flu.

The vaccines also help keep people out of he hospital, a detail that is missed when you only look at death rates. For those who are hospitalized from COVID the bills can range from $40k to $150k without insurance. Even with insurance most people are going to end up paying $10-20k depending on their plan. Great, they survived, now they get to spend the rest of their lives paying off the debt or declare bankruptcy. Not to mention the 30% of people who end up with long COVID, some of whom may never return to normal and may end up disabled for life.

It's just fucking stupid to claim that natural immunity is the best way. Even if vaccine immunity isn't as strong or long-lasting (even though there are plenty of studies that shows it is), it doesn't require people risking their lives by getting infected by COVID. If the vaccine immunity wears off after a year, fine, go get another vaccine. We get yearly flu shots already.

&gt; The variolation was where cowpox started. Basically Edward Jenner noticed that people who caught cowpox didn't get the smallpox. And developed the method to infect people using the blisters from cow, which we now call variolation.

I'm not sure what your first sentence means. I didn't quote it but your second sentence is contradicted by this:

&gt;Noting the common observation that milkmaids were generally immune to smallpox, Jenner postulated that the pus in the blisters that milkmaids received from cowpox (a disease similar to smallpox, but much less virulent) protected them from smallpox. 

Jenner noted common observations and didn't make them himself, he did though postulate on why it was happening.

Your third sentence is contradicted by what I did quote. The method was already developed by a few others, Jenner popularized the procedure. and verified that people who got it were immune. and the last bit was contradicted because variolation is used solely when talking about inoculating people using smallpox. Because at the time vaccination referred to inoculating people using cowpox like Jenner. The word was coined in 1800, Vaccinia=cowpox virus. in 1891 Pasture widened the definition of vaccination to all methods of inducing immunity.

Particularly this fragment:

&gt; The procedure was most commonly carried out by inserting/rubbing powdered smallpox scabs or fluid from pustules into superficial scratches made in the skin. The virus was normally spread through the air, infecting first the mouth, nose, or respiratory tract, before spreading throughout the body via the lymphatic system. In contrast, infection of the skin usually led to a milder, localized infection[citation needed]‚Äîbut, crucially, still induced immunity to the virus. The patient would develop pustules like those caused by naturally acquired smallpox. Eventually, after about two to four weeks,[citation needed] these symptoms would subside, indicating successful recovery and immunity. 

So basically it was a method to trigger a lighter version of the disease by ensuring the infection did not start from lungs. I did not know that, but then GP missed the step that I mentioned, which is the actual defining point of vaccination (introduction of a safer form of virus/bacteria to get a immunity)

&gt;By 1768, English physician John Fewster had realised that prior infection with cowpox rendered a person immune to smallpox. In the years following 1770, at least five investigators in England and Germany (Sevel, Jensen, Jesty 1774, Rendell, Plett 1791) successfully tested in humans a cowpox vaccine against smallpox. For example, Dorset farmer Benjamin Jesty successfully vaccinated and presumably induced immunity with cowpox in his wife and two children during a smallpox epidemic in 1774, but it was not until Jenner's work that the procedure became widely understood. Jenner may have been aware of Jesty's procedures and success.

It wasn't until 1796 that Jenner tested his innoculation.

&gt;Donald Hopkins has written, ""Jenner's unique contribution was not that he inoculated a few persons with cowpox, but that he then proved [by subsequent challenges] that they were immune to smallpox. Moreover, he demonstrated that the protective cowpox pus could be effectively inoculated from person to person, not just directly from cattle.""

[],,ilikepix,,,[],,,,text,t2_22hzs,False,False,[],"I guess the question is -- how much would masking while not at your table in an indoor restaurant have to reduce spread in order for it to be worth it?

If we say, hypothetically, that masking in an indoor restaurant while not at your table reduced spread from infected people by 1%, would it be worth it?

For me, the inconvenience is so low that if it reduces spread by any amount, it's worth it.

And is it likely that it reduces spread? I'm not an epidemiologist, but yes, it seems likely to me that it reduces spread to some degree. When you're sitting and eating in a typical restaurant, there are, say, somewhere between 4 and 8 people within a 6-foot radius of you, excluding people in your own party. But at some tables, it's very possible that many more than 8 people will walk within 6 feet of you over the course of your meal as they walk to their table or the restroom. If any of those people are actively shedding virus, you will have some protection if they are wearing a mask while closer to you. You'll also have better protection while you're waiting to be seated, or in the restroom.

People sometimes treat covid risk as a binary on/off condition, but it's a fundamentally probabilistic condition. I will take as many forms of risk mitigation as I can get, especially when they are as easy and convenient as wearing a mask for a few minutes in a restaurant while I'm not at my table.",,,,1635762924,{},hivaytj,False,t3_qjynt2,False,True,t1_hiuhu5m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qjynt2/vermont_the_most_vaccinated_state_in_the_nation/hivaytj/,1635961897.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think another reason why engineers and scientists can fall victim to conspiracy theories/pseudoscience is that when you study college-level physics or engineering, you see a lot of very elegant and mathematically ""pretty"" explanations of how the world works.  These theories are so satisfying that you want everything to have an explanation like that.  Of course, the world is very complicated and messy, and there are lots of cases where there's never going to be a single equation explaining everything.  But there's still a strong desire to have that one insight making everything fall into place.. which is what a lot of conspiracy theories promise.

That paper didn't get into *differences* between the two, if any, but it seems plausible that with the relatively higher dose Moderna vaccine - that this could be both good (more protection) and potentially have some negatives (side effects?  Complications??)

In any case, it will be good to see more days from the younger age groups.

The June Circ review reported on the data to that point; it's all been observational, so you get rates of expected vs observed by age and sex (table 1) and overall /crude rates of myocarditis/pericarditis by age and sex (remaining tables, numbers are in cases per million persons vaccinated).

They also reviewed what we know about Covid *infection* and bad outcomes by age group:

&gt;On the other hand, epidemiological data suggest that ‚âà12% to 20% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have evidence of cardiac injury as indicated by elevated levels of cardiac troponin.23,26¬†Furthermore in young athletes recovering from COVID-19 infection,27¬†cardiac MRI abnormalities consistent with myocarditis have been reported at a higher prevalence than expected, in ‚âà1% to 3% of the athletes.28‚Äì32

Finally, in their concluding paragraph as well as figures 2 and 3 they summarize risk of vaccination vs risk of infection.  

&gt;Despite these rare cases of myocarditis, the benefit-risk assessment for COVID-19 vaccination shows a favorable balance for all age and sex groups5¬†(Figures 2¬†and¬†3). Given the known potential risk of complications with COVID-19 infection, including hospitalizations and death even in younger adults (mortality remains 0.1‚Äì1 per 100‚Äâ000 for persons 12‚Äì29 years of age), the risk-benefit decision remains overwhelmingly favorable for vaccination. Therefore, COVID-19 vaccination is currently recommended for everyone ‚â•12 years of age5¬†(Figure 3).

The main objection I currently have is I think they could be a bit better at tailoring vaccine selection to individuals. There seem to be some differences in rates of side effects for various groups, and taking those into account when deciding which vaccine to use could at least make a psychological difference.

It might not be possible due to the way distribution happens - most places only seem to have one kind - which, I think, unfortunately reinforces the appearance of concern around safety and efficacy being mainly on a herd level rather than for individuals.

Another study showing (again small sample size), showing antibodies falling off after 60 days of positive infection.

Like I said above, I think we can all agree that more good research is needed.

[],,machineprophet343,,,[],,,,text,t2_87v4nnla,False,False,,"Yea, that's what a lot of people aren't getting -- yes, COVID might have a very high survival rate over scale, but even if you survive, there might be a fair number of long-term debilitating effects. Both probability of death and long COVID severity correlate with certain conditions.

Someone who in in peak physical health with no or very minor commodities (e.g, they're like 5 pounds or less overweight, or they have hay fever that isn't activated when they catch COVID) may have a \~99.999% chance of survival. Their chances of getting not getting Long COVID may also be like \~99.99%. 

Probability calculations are based heavily on givens.

For example, to have that high rate of survival being 99.999% might look like this: P(Survival | Good Health, Non-Active Allergies, Not Recently Ill, No Immuno-compromise, Favorable Genetic Markers, Ideal Weight, Age &lt; 50.) = 99.999%

So your odds of survival are 99.999% given you are in good health, don't have any active allergies, did not have any sort of illness (even a cold or stomach bug) recently,   are not immune compromised in any way, are at or near your ideal weight, and under the age of 50. Odds of significant or chronic long-COVID are also really low, maybe 0.002%.

However, your odds of survival might be 75% is...

P(Survival | Okay Health, Active Pollen Allergy, Had Cold Last Month, No Immuno-Compromise, one disfavorable genetic marker, 25% above Ideal Weight, Age &gt; 50) = \~75%, and your chances of Long-COVID may be even statistically high as well. And you might have a statistical likelihood (10%+) of having some form of long-COVID.

It depends on so many factors, and we all have seen the people who are walking comorbidities refusing to get vaccinated or calling it 'just a flu', who are banking that somehow they'll be in the 99.999% group rather than a group that, even if it is fairly low, are statistically likely to have severe illness or even death from COVID.",,,,1635796460,{},hix8f6v,False,t3_qkho3u,False,True,t1_hix5s81,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qkho3u/covid_death_risk_32_times_higher_for_the/hix8f6v/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,0d53942229350935bf36cbaab4bb5c0381bab675,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1635796475.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has weighed in for the first time in a detailed science report released with little fanfare Friday evening. Reviewing scores of research studies and its own unpublished data, the agency found that both infection-induced and vaccine-induced immunity are durable for at least six months ‚Äî but that vaccines are more consistent in their protection and offer a huge boost in antibodies for people previously infected.

&gt;In comparing the two types of immunity, scientists said research shows vaccination provides a ‚Äúhigher, more robust, and more consistent level of immunity to protect people from COVID-19 than infection alone.‚Äù

&gt;Coronavirus infections can cause severe disease or no symptoms at all, and the CDC found that antibody levels vary widely from one individual to another after an infection. The report also notes that there is no test authorized by the Food and Drug Administration that would enable doctors and the public to reliably measure an individual‚Äôs protection from disease. And although higher levels of neutralizing antibodies generally signal higher protection, scientists don‚Äôt know precisely what level of antibodies will protect an individual.

&gt;The CDC‚Äôs bottom line: Given what‚Äôs known and not known about immunity, people who have been infected with the virus should still get vaccinated. More than 45 million people in the United States have had confirmed coronavirus infections, and tens of millions more ‚Äî the exact number is unknown ‚Äî have had undocumented cases.

&gt;The science brief echoes another study, released by the CDC earlier Friday, that the agency said showed a higher level of protection from vaccines than from previous infection alone. That study said vaccinated patients hospitalized with covid-like symptoms were less likely to test positive for the virus than those who had recovered months earlier from a coronavirus infection. In other words, the patients vaccinated against the coronavirus were more likely to have some illness other than covid.

You cannot just extrapolate out from that a comparison between vaccinated uninfected and unvaccinated infected individuals.

Yes, that's what I'm trying to do. The difference between Table 6 and Table 7 is previously infected individuals, about 5% of the new Table 7. For the placebo arm, these new people are the unvaccinated infected (possibly unvaccinated + missing data), and there were 7 new cases of reinfected individuals. For the vaccine arm, the original Table 6 had 8 cases \*total\* over a much larger population. 

So I am trying to compare placebo arm of (Table 7 - Table 6) = unvaccinated infected, with the vaccine arm of Table 6, which is the vaccinated uninfected individuals. Taking into account the large N difference between them, it seems to me that (recent) vaccine is more effective than (possibly long ago) infection at preventing confirmed new cases of Covid.

&gt; Overall, 69 SARS-CoV-2 infections developed in the COVID-19 negative group (incidence of 12.22 per 100 person-years) versus one in the COVID-19 positive group (incidence of 0.40 per 100 person-years), indicating a relative reduction in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection of 96.7%

[This one, titled ‚ÄúSARS-CoV-2 infection rates of antibody-positive compared with antibody-negative health-care workers in England: a large, multicentre, prospective cohort study (SIREN)‚Äù](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21\)00675-9/fulltext) found about 84% protection, but described this as a minimum, due to multiple caveats that lowered the effect:

1. All but two ‚Äúreinfections‚Äù were classified as ‚Äúpossible‚Äù, the remaining two as ‚Äúprobable‚Äù, none as ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù. The 84% estimate is based on using all ‚Äúpossible‚Äù reinfections.
2. Only about one third of ‚Äúreinfections‚Äù had typical COVID symptoms
3. The authors did not include baseline seronegative people who converted to seropositive as COVID-19 cases
4. The authors found a pattern they indicated seemed consistent with RNA shedding, over counting ‚Äúreinfections‚Äù
The authors note these issues in their paper:

&gt; **Restricting reinfections to probable reinfections only, we estimated that between June and November 2020, participants in the positive cohort had 99% lower odds of probable reinfection, adjusted OR (aOR) 0.01 (95% CI 0.00-0.03). Restricting reinfections to those who were symptomatic we estimated participants in the positive cohort had 95% lower odds of reinfection**, aOR 0.08 (95% CI 0.05-0.13). Using our most sensitive definition of reinfections, including all those who were possible or probable the adjusted odds ratio was 0.17 (95% CI 0.13-0.24).

&gt; A prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an 83% lower risk of infection, with median protective effect observed five months following primary infection. **This is the minimum likely effect as seroconversions were not included.**

&gt; **There were 864 seroconversions in participants without a positive PCR test; these were not included as primary infections in this interim analysis.**

&gt; **We believe this is the minimum probable effect** because the curve in the positive cohort was gradual throughout, indicating some of these potential reinfections were probably residual RNA detection at low population prevalence rather than true reinfections.

And of course, there is the recent [Cleveland Clinic preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176v2) which found a 100% protective effect.

There‚Äôs the study on the [marines](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(21)00158-2/fulltext), which found a protective effect of about 82%. After adjusting for race, age and sex, the HR was 0.16 or a protective effect of 84%. The authors note that 84% of ‚Äúreinfections‚Äù were asymptomatic, compared to 68% of primary infections. However, the authors believe they may undercount reinfections:

&gt; Our investigation is likely to underestimate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in previously infected individuals because the seronegative group included an unknown number of previously infected participants who did not have significant IgG titres in their baseline serum sample.

However, they note that the conditions the marines were in for the study may limit it‚Äôs generalizability: 

&gt; The high rate of infection at MCRDPI can be attributed to the crowded living conditions, demanding regimen, and requirement for personal contact during basic training despite the pandemic leads, which is known to contribute to an increased risk for respiratory epidemics.28 The close quarters and constant contact among recruits that are needed for team building allow a viral infection to rapidly proliferate within a unit. The physically and mentally demanding training environment might also suppress immunity. These factors are not typically present in the civilian community. Therefore, the study setting limits the generalisability of our findings to other settings where the frequency and intensity of exposure and the susceptibility of the host might differ.

Lastly, I am aware of [this research](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2776810) which conveniently took index positives and then plotted the likelihood of a PCR positive by days since index. At 0 to 30 days, the ratio was 2.85. From 31 to 60 days, it was 0.74, dropping to 0.29 at 61 to 90 days, and finally to 0.10 at more than 90 days.",,,,1635724385,{},hitqvyi,False,t3_qjzcbw,False,False,t1_hitiulk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qjzcbw/covid19_vaccine_gives_5_times_the_protection_of/hitqvyi/,1635929619.0,20,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When you include people with past infections the Covid cases vaccine group increases from 8 to 9, but for the placebo group it increases from 162 to 169. At face value this suggests the vaccine is better than past infection

No it doesn‚Äôt, because the comparison is being made between vaccinated uninfected and vaccinated infected individuals. You cannot just extrapolate out from that a comparison between vaccinated uninfected and unvaccinated infected individuals.

&gt; Finally, it's a different product, but I've always found the Novavax data striking and it may more directly answer your question. See Table 2 of this paper. For the beta variant, patients who were seropositive at baseline were NOT better protected despite past infection. The vaccine did not do amazing (50% efficacy) either. While vaccine vs placebo was randomized, seropositive vs negative obviously is not and you might speculate that subjects who were seropositive were more likely to engage in risky behaviors -- but still, the absence of any signal from past infection is striking and disappointing. Novavax made a big deal about this in their press release and it gave me a sinking feeling when I read the news myself (like, if past infections don't protect us, that's a pretty bad sign for the world).

The Novavax trial is one of the only trials I‚Äôve seen that came to this conclusion. The linked studies I posted above are the norm. It‚Äôs hard to know how to interpret it. Obviously the Novavax trial would have to declare a conflict of interest in an independent setting. It‚Äôs odd that they are the only ones who have come to such a conclusion, but maybe the methodology is different.

My friend has been vaccinated with Moderna in Singapore about 3 months ago but due to personal situation he had to travel back to his native place(India) before he could take the second dose of Moderna. Now, he cannot get second dose of Moderna vaccine in India as it is not available there. And he is also finding it difficult to go back to Singapore as travel/entry is restricted to fully vaccinated people only. So he is in a catch-22 situation.  


My friend is worried that he may get unwanted side-effects if he goes for vaccines currently available in India Astrazeneca's (COVISHIELD)  vaccine as it's composition is different from Moderna's mRNA varient.

Are there any studies done with regards to usage of different vaccines (specifically Moderna (mRNA type) followed by COVISHIELD(adenovirus vector vaccine type) or are there any recommendations from experts?

&gt; Overall, 69 SARS-CoV-2 infections developed in the COVID-19 negative group (incidence of 12.22 per 100 person-years) versus one in the COVID-19 positive group (incidence of 0.40 per 100 person-years), indicating a relative reduction in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection of 96.7%

[This one, titled ‚ÄúSARS-CoV-2 infection rates of antibody-positive compared with antibody-negative health-care workers in England: a large, multicentre, prospective cohort study (SIREN)‚Äù](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21\)00675-9/fulltext) found about 84% protection, but described this as a minimum, due to multiple caveats that lowered the effect:

1. All but two ‚Äúreinfections‚Äù were classified as ‚Äúpossible‚Äù, the remaining two as ‚Äúprobable‚Äù, none as ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù. The 84% estimate is based on using all ‚Äúpossible‚Äù reinfections.
2. Only about one third of ‚Äúreinfections‚Äù had typical COVID symptoms
3. The authors did not include baseline seronegative people who converted to seropositive as COVID-19 cases
4. The authors found a pattern they indicated seemed consistent with RNA shedding, over counting ‚Äúreinfections‚Äù
The authors note these issues in their paper:

&gt; **Restricting reinfections to probable reinfections only, we estimated that between June and November 2020, participants in the positive cohort had 99% lower odds of probable reinfection, adjusted OR (aOR) 0.01 (95% CI 0.00-0.03). Restricting reinfections to those who were symptomatic we estimated participants in the positive cohort had 95% lower odds of reinfection**, aOR 0.08 (95% CI 0.05-0.13). Using our most sensitive definition of reinfections, including all those who were possible or probable the adjusted odds ratio was 0.17 (95% CI 0.13-0.24).

&gt; A prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an 83% lower risk of infection, with median protective effect observed five months following primary infection. **This is the minimum likely effect as seroconversions were not included.**

&gt; **There were 864 seroconversions in participants without a positive PCR test; these were not included as primary infections in this interim analysis.**

&gt; **We believe this is the minimum probable effect** because the curve in the positive cohort was gradual throughout, indicating some of these potential reinfections were probably residual RNA detection at low population prevalence rather than true reinfections.

And of course, there is the recent [Cleveland Clinic preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176v2) which found a 100% protective effect.

There‚Äôs the study on the [marines](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(21)00158-2/fulltext), which found a protective effect of about 82%. After adjusting for race, age and sex, the HR was 0.16 or a protective effect of 84%. The authors note that 84% of ‚Äúreinfections‚Äù were asymptomatic, compared to 68% of primary infections. However, the authors believe they may undercount reinfections:

&gt; Our investigation is likely to underestimate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in previously infected individuals because the seronegative group included an unknown number of previously infected participants who did not have significant IgG titres in their baseline serum sample.

However, they note that the conditions the marines were in for the study may limit it‚Äôs generalizability: 

&gt; The high rate of infection at MCRDPI can be attributed to the crowded living conditions, demanding regimen, and requirement for personal contact during basic training despite the pandemic leads, which is known to contribute to an increased risk for respiratory epidemics.28 The close quarters and constant contact among recruits that are needed for team building allow a viral infection to rapidly proliferate within a unit. The physically and mentally demanding training environment might also suppress immunity. These factors are not typically present in the civilian community. Therefore, the study setting limits the generalisability of our findings to other settings where the frequency and intensity of exposure and the susceptibility of the host might differ.

Lastly, I am aware of [this research](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2776810) which conveniently took index positives and then plotted the likelihood of a PCR positive by days since index. At 0 to 30 days, the ratio was 2.85.

The governor‚Äôs order also brings the state closer to full-blown rationing of medical care. It allows for implementation of so-called crisis of care standards, a detailed protocol for health care workers to decide in an emergency who should be treated first.  
Acute care hospital bed occupancy -- that‚Äôs both intensive care unit and medical-surging unit beds -- has been averaging about 90%, state data show. Staffing shortages have been severe in many parts of Colorado, both urban and rural.

Because the antibodies are literally being developed and trained in real time against the actual virus itself. This article is a load of bullshit.

For instance, in a report released from the Ministry of Health in Israel, the effectiveness of 2 doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine against preventing COVID-19 infection was reported to be 39% [6], substantially lower than the trial efficacy of 96% [7]. It is also emerging that immunity derived from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine may not be as strong as immunity acquired through recovery from the COVID-19 virus [8]. A substantial decline in immunity from mRNA vaccines 6-months post immunization has also been reported [9]. Even though vaccinations offers protection to individuals against severe hospitalization and death, the CDC reported an increase from 0.01 to 9% and 0 to 15.1% (between January to May 2021) in the rates of hospitalizations and deaths, respectively, amongst the fully vaccinated [10].

In summary, even as efforts should be made to encourage populations to get vaccinated it should be done so with humility and respect. Stigmatizing populations can do more harm than good. Importantly, other non-pharmacological prevention efforts (e.g., the importance of basic public health hygiene with regards to maintaining safe distance or handwashing, promoting better frequent and cheaper forms of testing) needs to be renewed in order to strike the balance of learning to live with COVID-19 in the same manner we continue to live a 100¬†years later with various seasonal alterations of the¬†1918 Influenza virus.

&gt;  
&gt;Dr Holohan said the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) would continue to monitor the level of the disease and review data, the international research and guidance and ‚Äúto update our advice accordingly‚Äù.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúI am conscious that parents and guardians will be concerned about the high level of incidence of Covid-19 among the five to 12 age group, particularly as children head back to school on Monday after the mid-term,‚Äù he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;But he stressed international evidence showed that in the vast majority of cases, children who became infected with Covid-19 experienced mild symptoms or were asymptomatic.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThe public health advice is based on scientific evidence and the direct experience of the pandemic in Ireland. It shows that child-to-child transmission is uncommon in school settings where there are preventive measures in place like those throughout our schools,‚Äù he added.  
&gt;  
&gt;Infectious diseases expert Dr Sam McConkey said he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúwildly concerned‚Äù about children returning to primary school at a time of rising Covid cases as the virus generally doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúmake them \[kids\] very sick.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;And despite calls from the Irish Primary Principals Network and the Irish National Teachers‚Äô Organisation (INTO) for contact tracing to be reintroduced in primary schools, he said that instead of going down the route of ‚Äúwasting resources‚Äù in returning to contact tracing in primary schools, we instead need to focus on improving it in the wider community.  
&gt;  
&gt;Prof McConkey said with inclement weather and the transition from late autumn to early winter, the public are starting to move indoors for parties and celebrations.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúWe need really good contact tracing \[in the community\] in the next few weeks. There are big parties going on for Halloween and so on and people are going to weddings. People are having big indoor parties now that the weather has turned.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr Holohan said ‚Äúschools are vital to the health and wellbeing of our children and it is important that we continue to balance the priorities of safeguarding public health in the community with the social and psychological development needs of our youngest generation‚Äù.  
&gt;  
&gt;He urged parents and guardians to continue to observe the public health advice at home and at school drop-off and pick-up and remember to keep a safe 2m distance from other parents or guardians at these busy times.  
&gt;

They guess that Africa has between 500,000 and 2 million uncounted Covid deaths (in excess of combined official death toll of 200,000), that India has between 1 million and 6.5 million uncounted Covid deaths (in excess of official death toll of 460,000), that China has between 0 and 1.7 million uncounted Covid deaths (in excess of official death toll of 4600), and that Asia as a whole has between 4 and 12 million uncounted Covid deaths (in excess of combined official death toll of almost 1.2 million), thanks to a number of countries that may have 100,000 to 1 million uncounted Covid deaths each. 

(I have rounded the numbers.) 

I have not pried into the code or their statement of methods, so for now I am just looking at their numbers. The figures for China may look especially strange. It's because they estimate uncounted Covid deaths by estimating ""excess deaths"" for the period of the pandemic, and for China they estimate that there were between -180000 and 1.7 million excess deaths.

‚Ä¢Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, concern for clinician well-being was growing.  
  
‚Ä¢While two meta-analyses of studies regarding clinician well-being during the pandemic exist, they do not include hospital-based nurses from the United States.  
  
‚Ä¢This is one of the first reports of the emotional well-being of hospital-based United States nurses during the acute phase of the pandemic.  
  
‚Ä¢These nurses experienced higher rates of anxiety, depression, traumatic stress, and insomnia compared with two meta-analyses that include healthcare workers worldwide.  
  
  
Abstract  
Studies show decreased well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for healthcare providers from Asia. Less is known about the psychological responses of working during the pandemic on hospital-based registered nurses (RNs) in the United States (US). Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to report the well-being of U.S.-based hospital RNs working during the initial acute phase of COVID-19 and compare it with well-being among healthcare workers described in two global meta-analyses. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in May-June 2020 (N=467). Well-being was measured using the following tools: Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-2 for depressive symptoms, Impact of Events Scale-Revised for traumatic stress, and the Insomnia Severity Index. Compared with global rates from two meta-analyses, US-based RNs reported significantly more traumatic stress (54.6% vs. 11.4% and 21.5%; p&lt;.001) and depressive symptoms (54.6% vs. 31.8% and 21.7%; p&lt;.001). Rates of insomnia were also higher in U.S.-based RNs than in the meta-analysis that reported insomnia (32.4% vs 27.8%; p&lt;.033). Rates of anxiety symptoms among US-based RNs did not differ from that reported in one meta-analysis (37.3% vs. 34.4%), while it was significantly higher in the other (37.3% vs. 22.1%; p&lt;.001). Hospital-based RNs from the US exhibited over twice the rates of trauma and nearly double the rates of depressive symptoms than shown in reports from hospital workers globally during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The lasting effects of this distress are unknown and warrant ongoing evaluation and solutions to better support emotional well-being and prevent burnout in the workplace.

A vaccine tricks the body into reacting as if you actually caught the virus and to create the antibodies for that virus your body does not just randomly create antibodies for things it has not encountered, most people's bodies can make strong enough and enough antibodies to be safe from that strain, some can't.

 no 2 people are exactly the same so how effective the vaccine is will vary for each individual, I know people that had very bad reaction to the vaccine and others that had no reaction to the vaccine,  some people have even DIED from the vaccine, as for higher survival rates in hospital it isn't 100% from vaccine it is that hospitals now know best way to treat people, unvaccinated are even having a lot higher survival rates.

Methodology:  Basically, they went through the medical records of 201,000 patients admitted to a hospital with ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äìlike illness‚Äù (more on this later) and found that 89 of them that had a prior infection and no-vaccination and 324 that had a prior vaccination.  From that they concluded that the risks were greater for the prior infected (despite being outnumbered 3 to 1 in the sample) than the just-vaccinated, at 8.7% (prior infected) to 5.1% (prior vaccinated).  This part is reasonable because there were many more prior vaccinated than prior infected in the sampled population.

However, the study has a lot of problems, the main one of which is that it is trying to draw a conclusion from a subpopulation of 413 people deliberated picked out of 201,000, and none of the data is being made available, so you cannot test the assumptions that were made.  This is important because of the stunningly small size of the population of people pulled from the original 201,000.  If, for example, 50 people shifted out of the prior infected the result would flip.

Further, the study does is somewhat ambiguous on how they defined a  ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äìlike illness‚Äù.  This is really important, since it seems to be doing most of the lifting here, as more than 90% in both groups tested negative for COVID, and a small movement of people in the prior infected group would have a big impact on the study.  Again the data is not made available, so we cannot test what happens when you move people discharged for one symptom or another causes a case to move out of the target group.

Not surprising the confidence interval, more here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence\_interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval), shows that a 95% range for infection rates in prior infecteds as being between 2.75‚Äì10.99, i.e. either much better than the vaccination or a bit worse.

This looks, from the outside, like a P-Hacking experiment that did not even manage to meet the confidence interval hurdle, even after they zeroed in on less than one-half of a percent of the original population.

The good news is that, since the CDC can only locate 89 people out of a 210,000 sample that fit into the prior infected group and only 324 vaccinated people, it is likely that both provide very robust immunity from serious infection, with the vaccine having the added advantages of protecting you from having to get sick in the first place.  Further, even if you had been infected before, the vaccine offers cumulative protection, [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm?s\_cid=mm7032e1\_w](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm?s_cid=mm7032e1_w), at very low risk.",,,,1635784080,{},hiwedfw,False,t3_qjzcbw,False,True,t3_qjzcbw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qjzcbw/covid19_vaccine_gives_5_times_the_protection_of/hiwedfw/,1635985623.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wgich is why the dutch government has ruled to increase the 6 month period of being deemed immune (and not needing a vaccine per se), to 12 months or maybe longer. Its not in effect but has been passed through parlement and granted by the kabinet (ruling parties).
this was adviced by the national institute of (medical) research, which is more of a meta institue, that gathers and sifts through international medical data.

Also, as a uni student ive always been surprised when seeing assumptions made for millions, based on 30 people, or 70 even.

In cases regarding deciding on immunity, research that weighs data based on 600.000, done by a know research institute, and backed up by many doctors, seems pretty valid on face value. Upon reading further too.
There is also the data from bone marrow research, published in Nature months ago, which seemed to point to lasting immunity. Maybe even years.

The problem of presenting immunity data, is that there is a great difference in immunity for 80 year olds compared to 60 year olds.

But in many discussions age is not differentiated.

6 months immunity is possible for 80 /90 plus.
While all others are now expected to maybe even have 5 years of immunity. Ofcourse also excluding the 1,1% of people who are never immune/ or errors in the tests.

&gt;Mayor Bill de Blasio said 9,000 employees were placed on unpaid leave until they get their first shot. That‚Äôs less than 6% of the nearly 400,000 workforce.

&gt;Another 12,000 applied for medical or religious exemptions. In the meantime, they are working but being tested.

&gt;**The overall vaccination rate for the city workforce remains at 91%.**

&gt;**Going down the list, the NYPD is at 85%, Department of Sanitation is at 83% and FDNY is at 81%.**

&gt;Uniformed Firefighter Association President Andrew Ansbro said Monday some of the city‚Äôs bravest who are vaccinated didn‚Äôt necessarily do so by choice.

&gt;‚ÄúThis is not a way to run a public service ‚Äî a life saving public service ‚Äî in such a haphazard way,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe ones that are there are going to do the best to fulfill their oaths and live up to what they promised the city of New York. Unfortunately, they‚Äôre put in this position by mayoral mandate.‚Äù

&gt;The latest numbers show 19% of the FDNY‚Äôs 17,000 overall workforce is not vaccinated. Among them, firefighters are at 23% unvaccinated, and EMS workers are at 12%.

&gt;The union expects dozens of fire companies will shut down, but resources and vaccinated staff will be redistributed so no overall firehouses will have to close. Some may have to work 80 hours a week to make up for those absent.

&gt;‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not pointing the finger at the firefighter they work with that decided not to get the vaccine. Some of them didn‚Äôt want the vaccine either, but they had to comply because they couldn‚Äôt live without the paycheck,‚Äù Ansboro said.

&gt;Fire unions are now asking for an extension, saying firefighters and officers need more time to file religious or medical exemptions.

&gt;‚ÄúWe only got nine days to comply with this mandate. The teachers got 30 days, Correction has December 1st,‚Äù said Uniformed Fire Officers Association President Jim McCartney.

&gt;However, Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro says they had enough time.

&gt;‚ÄúFor more than 10 months, every member of this department has had every opportunity to be vaccinated, as they should have been,‚Äù he said Monday.

&gt;Mayor Bill de Blasio also remains unmoved, sticking to his mandate and encouraging other cities to do the same.

&gt;‚ÄúTo every mayor in America, to every governor in America, to every CEO of a company in America, go to a full vaccination mandate,‚Äù he said.

&gt;The mayor continues to insist the city is safe and response times for 911 calls will not be impacted.

&gt;The FDNY said 2,300 firefighters called out sick over the weekend in wake of the mandate.

The rest of your comment is just your personal opinion, and frankly I think it's incorrect. If you look at the data from these highly vaccinated states (most of the NE is sitting around 70/80% full/half vaccinated respectively), the death rate didn't increase with the same rate as the cases. Vaccines did their job of preventing most cases from being serious, and most deaths were amongst the vulnerable (who should be taking more precautions anyways). 

Once 5-12 can be vaccinated in a couple weeks, the vaccination rate will shoot higher, and there will be *no more excuses* to continuing other mitigations beyond vaccines, unless you are vulnerable or live with someone who is. 

What we're doing right now isn't sustainable, from a societal perspective, or a political capital perspective.

The ruling was a blow to Mayor Lori Lightfoot and a victory for a police union that has been engaged in an increasingly vitriolic battle with City Hall over the rule.

&gt;Judge Raymond W. Mitchell of the Cook County Circuit Court said that as unionized employees, police officers had a right to have their objections to the mandate heard by an arbitrator before the requirement takes effect. If an arbitrator were to rule against the city after the vaccine mandate was being enforced, the judge wrote, there would be little recourse for officers who got vaccinated under duress.

&gt;‚ÄùAn award of back pay or reinstatement cannot undo a vaccine,‚Äù Judge Mitchell wrote. ‚ÄúNothing can.‚Äù

&gt;Across the country, police unions have fought requirements that their members get vaccinated, sometimes leading to fears of mass resignations, as in Los Angeles County, Calif., where the sheriff has warned of a potential exodus.

&gt;The opposition to vaccination mandates has come even though nearly 500 American law enforcement officers have died from work-related Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page ‚Äî  far more than have died from any other work-related cause in the last two years. On Monday, thousands of New York City employees, including police officers, were placed on unpaid leave for failing to get vaccinated by the city‚Äôs deadline.

&gt;In Chicago, Judge Mitchell‚Äôs ruling left in place a requirement for officers to report their vaccination status to the city, which the police union has opposed, and to undergo regular testing if not vaccinated.

&gt;‚ÄùThe reporting obligation itself is a minimal intrusion particularly considering that police officers are already obligated to provide medical information to their employer,‚Äù the judge wrote.

&gt;About 71 percent of Chicago Police Department employees had reported their vaccination status to the city by last week, by far the lowest rate of any city department. Around 7,300 police employees said they were vaccinated, while about 1,700 said they were not. More than 3,000 others had not provided their status. John Catanzara, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police in Chicago, which represents rank-and-file officers, had suggested that his members ignore the order and risk discipline or loss of pay.

&gt;Ms. Lightfoot‚Äôs office said the mayor would address the ruling later on Monday. Mr. Catanzara did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

On the other hand, you have people now who ARE fully vaccinated who treat their risk as being the same as before. That's also weird and short sighted.

&gt;Jeffrey D. Zients, the administration‚Äôs pandemic response coordinator, said that the government will deliver several million doses to doctors‚Äô offices, pharmacies, health clinics and other sites within the next couple of days. But he appeared to dampen expectations that all the pending orders that states have placed for pediatric vaccine would be filled right away.

&gt;‚ÄùWe are planning on some vaccinations towards the end of this week,‚Äù he said, adding that the government will deliver a total of 15 million doses ‚Äúacross the next week or so.‚Äù

&gt;There are 28 million children aged 5 to 11 in the United States. Surveys indicate that only about one in three parents will permit their children to be vaccinated immediately.

&gt;Mr. Zients, speaking at a White House briefing, said the government began shipping doses within minutes of the Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs authorization Friday afternoon of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on an emergency basis for young children. ‚ÄúWe began the process of moving 15 million doses from Pfizer‚Äôs freezers and facilities to distribution centers,‚Äù he said. From there, officials said, they will be shipped to roughly 20,000 vaccination sites, including children‚Äôs hospitals, pharmacies, pediatrician‚Äôs offices and health clinics.

&gt;‚ÄùMore doses will be packed and shipped and delivered each and every day over the next week,‚Äù he said.

&gt;The pediatric rollout depends on recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which sets vaccine policy. The agency often follows recommendations from its advisory panel of experts, which is meeting Tuesday on the subject of Pfizer doses for children 5 to 11 years old.

&gt;Mr. Zients said setbacks to Moderna‚Äôs hopes to offer its vaccine to adolescents and younger children would not affect the vaccination campaign, because the government was counting only on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for those age groups. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in great shape on supply,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have more than enough vaccine for every child 5 to 11.‚Äù

&gt;Over the weekend, Moderna announced that it would delay asking for regulatory authorization of a half-dose of its vaccine for children aged 6 to 11. The company decided to pull back after regulators informed the company that they may not complete their review this year of Moderna‚Äôs earlier request to offer a full dose of its vaccine to adolescents 12 to 17.

&gt;Regulators cited concerns about the risks of myocarditis, a condition involving inflammation of the heart muscle.

I asked him whether anybody at the family gathering showed symptoms and his response was that ""Uncle Burt had a bit of a cough but he was pretty sure it was just allergies.""

First. vaccines are a transient inconvenience. You get two shots, and go on with your life, with no issues. Eventually you forget about it and it's no longer something you think about. 

Masks are an ongoing inconvenience that you have to deal with every single time you leave the house for an unknown period of time. People are more likely to be bothered by a minor consistent inconvenience, than a transient inconvenience, even if the transient inconvenience seems like it's a bigger deal. 

Second, Vaccines are orders of magnitude more effective than masks or distancing in both preventing spread and serious outcomes. It's not even close. If you're going to spend political capital on a mandated intervention, it should be the one that gives the most bang for your buck. 

Lastly, those issues are not the same. Risk in this situation IS personal, because your risk of getting seriously ill is based on your medical history, age, general health, comorbidities, etc. 

A healthy 25 yo doesn't have the same risk profile as a 65 yo cancer patient, and can therefore operate with accepting more risk on a regular basis.

Masking does not require that you put anything into your body.  It's maybe a little uncomfortable, that's it.  Why wouldn't the government 1. require masks during times of high community spread and 2. engage in public education encouraging masks for everyone, just like we did for hand-washing and 3. mandate masking for certain employees, just like restaurant employees are required to wash their hands?

*The researchers looked at data from nine states on 201,269 hospitalizations for COVID-like illness from Jan 1 to Sep 2, 2021. Of these, 94,264 had molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2, and 7,348 (7.8%) had lab-confirmed COVID-19. Among that group, 1,020 hospitalizations were among previously infected and unvaccinated people, and 6,328 cases were among fully vaccinated people who were not previously infected.*  
  
*Lab-confirmed COVID-19 was found in 324 (5.1%) of the fully vaccinated people and in 89 (8.7%) of the unvaccinated, previously infected people.*

Is it stating that there were 201,000 suspected hospitalisations from Covid, from which they tested 92,000 and found 7,300 (8%) actually had Covid?

Following on from this, 1000 (of the 7300) had a prior infection (and no vaccination) and 6300  (of the 7300) were fully vaccinated (I've rounded numbers).

[],,wttttcbb,,,[],,,,text,t2_u3vai,False,False,[],"I've had Hashimoto's for about 10 years. I also have RA and general predisposition to autoimmune disorders. I'm not on heavy immunosuppressants for anything (stuff like Humira) or high dose steroids (prednisone), my conditions are controlled and my bloodwork is normal. In theory, I shouldn't be at much higher COVID risk than anyone else my age. Does your wife have other risk factors that are, in her mind, compounding her risk? Like asthma, respiratory issues, overweight, etc. 

My risk avoidance isn't due to those things though, more because I have a kid under 5. I don't want to pass it to him, or get sick while I have to parent. I still shop in-person (masked) when I need to, but generally don't eat in restaurants or go to large indoor gatherings. We have small groups of vaccinated friends visit. 

I will say that having your own body turn against you, as happens with Hashimoto's and other autoimmune disorders, can be jarring. Your body suddenly decides to attack itself, requiring you to take meds for the rest of your life through no fault of your own and you have no control. I don't know how long ago your wife got diagnosed but it can be a lot to process and can be a struggle: doctors saying there's nothing wrong, get more sleep, you're just stressed, etc. Fatigue and brain fog are common with autoimmune disorders and knowing something is wrong, but not what it is or how to fix it, is awful. Long COVID is another disorder with a lot of unusual/unpredictable symptoms so I don't fault her for worrying about that. Autoimmune disorders can also pop up after a virus, or hormonal shift like menopause, or extreme stress, so some people get avoidant. I developed RA after giving birth, something that should just be a normal human thing, so I'm more hesitant about a lot of things. It can feel like you're walking on eggshells with your own body.

The reason for this is because natural infection covers everything from an asymptotic case all the way up to a severe case that results in hospitalization.  The studies that compare natural immunity to vaccination are only factoring in the severe cases so if you had no/mild symptoms several months ago then there‚Äôs a decent chance you‚Äôre no longer immune and could get very sick if you caught COVID again.

People with prior infections who remain unvaccinated are over 2x more likely to be reinfected as someone who had a previous infection and got vaccinated.

Vaccination is better because it‚Äôs a consistent dosage that has a consistent effect and doesn‚Äôt require you to be severely ill to have comparable immunity.

746,000 Americans have died of covid-19 in the last 22 months. That works out to about 406,909 deaths per year.

[The CDC estimates that an average of 12,000-52,000 people died of the flu](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html) annually between 2010 and 2020. Even on the high end of flu deaths, that means that covid resulted in 8 times as many deaths as the flu in an average year. That's a helluva lot different than ""1% worse.""

Never mind the fact that, again, if you're so concerned about ""bodily autonomy,"" they're going to continue to violate people's bodily autonomy by requiring them to get various vaccines every single year in order to attend public school, serve in the military, and do various other jobs around this country, as they have done for decades now without complaint from most people who are all of a sudden concerned about people being required to get vaccinated.",,,,1635789582,{},hiwrmux,False,t3_qkg65l,False,False,t1_hiwq250,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qkg65l/nyc_issues_warning_to_those_faking_sick_over/hiwrmux/,1635993000.0,26,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,
