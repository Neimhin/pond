&gt;While he noted that the vaccine is [currently optional](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/07/06/pentagon-eyes-possible-mandatory-covid-19-vaccine-fda-weighs-approval.html) and administered under the U.S. [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.upi.com/topic/Food_and_Drug_Administration/)'s Emergency Use Authorization, full FDA approval could mean making the vaccine mandatory.   
     
&gt;""It [the vaccine] is not FDA-approved and therefore it is still a voluntary vaccine,"" he added. ""I would like to add that as we speak almost 69 percent of DoD personnel have received at least one dose. That's not bad.""  
          
&gt;Over 930,000 U.S. service members have been fully vaccinated thus far.

1. One doctoral student at Singapore General Hospital in Singapore in August 2003.
2. A 44-year-old senior scientist at the National Defense University in Taipei in December 2003. He was confirmed to have the SARS virus after working on a SARS study in Taiwan's only BSL-4 lab. The Taiwan CDC later stated the infection occurred due to laboratory misconduct.
3. Two researchers at the Chinese Institute of Virology in Beijing, April 2004, who spread it to around six other people. The two researchers contracted it 2 weeks apart.

Once desperately lacking jabs, Taiwan has benefited from vaccine diplomacy, receiving near 5 million doses from the United States and Japan following its worst outbreak starting in May that was being driven by a more contagious delta variant of the coronavirus.

Taiwan has also accused China, which claims the self-ruled island as its renegade territory, of intervening to block the delivery of vaccines. China denies it as an attempt by the island’s government to shift responsibility for a recent surge.

Health Minister Chen Shih-chung thanked Japan shortly before the vaccines arrived. “We are once again expressing our gratitude,” he said.

Taiwan had signed commitments to purchase more than 29 million doses of vaccines, but given global supply constraints and manufacturing delays, it was left with only about 700,000 doses when the number of cases rose sharply in May.

Taiwan’s allies, including the U.S. and Japan, have stepped in, enabling the island to start distributing the shots quickly. Now, 11.45% of the population have received at least one shot.

Under bilateral arrangements, Japan has donated 1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine each to Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia. Similar shipments are planned for Thailand and the Philippines later this month.

On Wednesday, Taiwan received a batch of 626,000 doses from AstraZeneca that it had purchased itself, the official Central News Agency reported.",,,1625745408,{},h4gpp1y,True,t3_og5b2v,False,False,t3_og5b2v,/r/Coronavirus/comments/og5b2v/taiwan_receives_another_11m_doses_of_vaccine_from/h4gpp1y/,1625939179,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

(First shot) 💉💪🩹,dark,text,t2_l1izy,False,False,[],"&gt; The development of the new corona vaccine, in which the UMCG is involved, is progressing well. The research has now reached the second phase and volunteers are again needed for this.

&gt; This is the AKS-452 vaccine from the American company Akston Biosciences. The first research results are positive. For the second phase the UMCG is now looking for 116 volunteers aged 18 to 85 who are healthy, have not had corona and have not yet received any other corona vaccine.

&gt; No placebo
&gt; Everyone who participates in the study will receive a vaccine. Thus, no placebo is used in this study. Participants will receive financial compensation as a thank you. It is not said that every suitable candidate, who has applied, will actually participate. The interest in the first phase of the study was overwhelming.

&gt; Signing up for the study can be done by sending an email to ACTstudie@chir.umcg.nl. More information can be found at: https://www.umcg.nl/-/medisch-wetenschappelijk-onderzoek/act-studie.

&gt; It seems that the vaccine offers very good protection. In all sixty participants in the first trial phase, an ""excellent antibody response"" occurred with one shot of the vaccine. A much higher concentration of antibodies was also found in the vaccinated volunteers than in people who had COVID-19 infection.

&gt; Mild side effects
&gt; A few volunteers did experience mild side effects similar to currently registered vaccines, such as a biting sensation at the site of the vaccination shortly after vaccination.

&gt; Different type of vaccine
&gt; The Akston vaccine is based on a spike protein, which is fused to a protein fragment of a human antibody. No genetic material is used in this type of vaccine. Thus, it is not an mRNA vaccine nor does it use another virus.

&gt; Keepable at room temperature
&gt; According to the researchers, the advantage of the Akston vaccine is that it can be stored in the refrigerator and remains good for up to four weeks at room temperature. It is therefore easy to transport to other parts of the world, such as Afrka and Latin America. There, storage temperatures of -80°C (the storage temperature of currently registered vaccines) are often impossible.

&gt; Aston now has 250 million vaccines ready to go. These can be used once the research is completed and the official bodies have given the green light.

Several reasons have been thrown around:

- Lobbying by the GPs because they get paid for the services they render
- Using existing infrastructure to increase total vaccination capacity
- Closer relationship with patients to give them peace of mind
- Knowledge about medical history to prioritize, or advise about side effects
- Home visits, accessibility and reaching out, esp. to the elderly

I think the terrible scheduling experience could've been mitigated if there was a unified booking portal like there is (by state/region) for the vaccination centers. But right now, every office does their own thing, and most of them have a terrible digital presence anyway.

That’s an over simplification. Vaccine refusal + a refusal to mask + other complicating factors. 

There’s a doc in the Tulsa area who continues to claim masks are harmful. You can get a book from his website that explains why. But wait, there’s more! His immune supplements will protect you. 

My pulmonologist is in the Tulsa area. My last appointment I was strongly encouraged to remove my mask. Not for a breathing test, but because all the staff are supposedly vaccinated. None of the staff was masked. This particular doc advertises for symptomatic people to get tested for covid at his office. They do have a separate waiting area for sick patients similar to what pediatricians often do. Not very effective for something like the Delta variant. 

Add in social media bullshit of everyone vaxxed is going to die within two years and you have a greater risk of dying from the new variants if you’re vaxxed, then you might start to understand the uphill battle of increasing the vaccination rate. 

There will be breakthrough covid cases in those vaccinated, especially in areas of low vaccinations. A doc at the hospital in Grove (small town, far NE Oklahoma) says a quarter of their patients are fully vaccinated. (Link is in my post history.) I expect that to become more common. 

Vaccination in an area where others around you are also vaccinated is more effective than vaccination in an area where so many refuse to take the shot.

Two very different things. The latter is influenced heavily by relative vaccination rates.

This shows that you are right if you were referring to the latter metric, and the slight increase is probably due to higher vaccination rates in older populations rather than a more dangerous variant.

Even if they don't do that for everyone, it's also looking a lot like they're going to keep requiring masks in public schools, regardless of grade level, on the logic that children younger than 12 do not yet have access to vaccines. I'm in high school, and I was halfway through 10th grade when the whole shutdown happened. I already had *two* of my school years ruined by the pandemic restrictions, and *I don't want it to be* ***three.*** *Especially* considering that *the third year would be my final year of grade school; after that, it's off to college.* Lumping in the innocent with the guilty just to torture us, right?

They were one of the last states to retract their mask mandate, so logically it's very likely that they'll be one of the first states to reimplement it, using a combination of variant threat, seasonality, the aforementioned inability to vaccinate young children, or any combination thereof. *I don't want that to happen, of course, but* ***to keep myself from getting disappointed, I tell myself the worst-case scenario anyway.*** It's a coping mechanism of sorts. Now I don't want to get too political on this politically neutral community, but my governor is up for re-election this year, so it's really hard to tell.

From January 2021 through March 2021, an estimated 1,594 people under 34 died from covid, compared to 187,281 that were 35+ (0.8% under 35).

The very small increase in % of deaths attributable to those under 35 is likely due to the high vaccination rates in older populations, rather than any mutation that suddenly has made this virus more dangerous for younger folks.

Yes. That's what I said. Because that is the objective real fact. We have learned a lot about the genetic sequence of SARS-COV2 so far.. and as admirable as that progress is,. we still don't know enough to be able to accurately predict individual outcomes. (a big part of that is because outcomes are not based on the virus ALONE. There are many other factors (Age, medical-history, complications, genetics, blood type, etc). We're still learning those things. That's how science works. It's a process of continual learning.

Agreed. I never said it wasn't.

I never said that?..

You are correct. I would not (nor have I ever) said that.

No?. I'm not. 

Generalized statistics are just that:.. GENERALIZED. 

If you have a population of 1 million people,. and you say a certain outcome is possible in 1% of cases,. that means of that 1 million people,. you're going to have 10,000 people with that negative outcome. 

But it doesn't mean you know (EXACTLY) which 10,000 people (individually) it's going to be. That part could be random (or you don't (yet) have enough information). . (You may not know enough about the situation to be able to accurately predict WHICH 10,000 individuals it will be).

Anything could happen, and also no a restaurant is not to small to recycle the air. The big thing about HVACs early on way making sure filters were replaced/switched out for different ones or to increase the rate of exchange in the air. 

I get you are talking about a specific restaurant, it's just an anecdote. Yes in general people aren't researching this stuff in depth and have widely weird and uninformed opinions, and yeah most restaurants prob did it wrong.

I wasn't talking about any of that really. Also no, if it is airborne is can't just go anyway. It goes where air currents lead it, which again plexi glass stops and changes the direction of air currents, and with a decent HVAC that place should be recycling very quickly. 

But this is why this is all difficult to discuss, most people have many anecdotes and most people jump to conclusions. It was never about preventing spread 100%, it's a reduction of the chance and really in the end there is some amount of risk.

They’re concerned about the potential health risk of taking this vaccine, or having their children take the vaccine.

Look, I’m vaccinated, but I get it.  I’m a healthcare provider, so I was one of the ones who was offered the vaccine in early January.  I was the first person I know to take the vaccine.  It’s scary being one of the first, and I was hesitant at the time too.  I remember trying to do as much research as I could before booking my first shot on January 4th.  At the time, every article I could find said it was safe.  Reddit, and in fact this very sub said it was safe, that the safety trials were comprehensive and conclusive.  Everyone said the only potential side effect of this vaccine would be maybe anaphylactic shock, but that would occur in the first half hour (later shortened to 15 mins) and I would be monitored at that time before they let me go home.  I was told if I cleared that first half hour, I would be good.  I did a ton of googling at the time and I definitely don’t remember coming across any mention of blood clots or myocarditis.  Now granted, I took Moderna which isn’t implicated in either of those two potential side effects, but I was researching all the vaccines and I would have remembered if the safety trials said anything about bloods or myocarditis.

And now it’s come out that the post-vaccination anaphylactic side effects I’m the first half hour aren’t the only possible side effects.  Now I see side effects being linked to the second shot.  Articles announcing these said effects say they found the “surprising link” between these conditions and the vaccine. Which means I wasn’t told the truth.  Or the safety trials weren’t thorough enough to catch these things.  Either way, it’s inarguable that there were unexpected side effects that emerged beyond the time frame we were told.   Wanting to wait and see isn’t that absurd a position.

I got my second shot of Moderna January 29th. I remember wondering why the pharma developers insisted on immunity from potential side effects as a condition to the vaccine distribution.  Then I saw this article

&gt; With 25 companies testing their vaccine candidates on humans and getting ready to immunise hundred millions of people once the products are shown to work, the question of who pays for any claims for damages in case of side effects has been a tricky point in supply negotiations.

&gt;“This is a unique situation where **we as a company simply cannot take the risk if in ... four years the vaccine is showing side** effects,” Ruud Dobber, a member of Astra’s senior executive team, told Reuters.

Source: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-astrazeneca-results-vaccine-liability-idUSKCN24V2EN

So now they’re saying they wanted immunity to protect themselves from having to compensate people if side effects show up IN FOUR YEARS.  Four years!  So the whole thing about “if you don’t experience side effects right away, you’re good.  Vaccines simply don’t exhibit side effects later than that.  That’s not how vaccines work” wasn’t entirely truthful in how confident it was about long term safety.

And then you have to wonder.  If you get develop some kind of illness in four years and require hospitalization or expensive treatment resulting from the vaccine, the vaccine makers won’t support you.  Health insurance also does not cover covid vaccine side effects.  So you’re left with the liability all on your own?  Are all the people who pushed you to vaccinate via peer pressure going to suffer the health effects?  No, you will suffer them yourself.  Are they going to financially support your treatment that neither the vaccine developers nor health insurance are willing to be accountable for?  No, the financial risks are yours some to bear.  So if you alone will suffer the potential risks of the vaccines, shouldn’t you alone get to decide whether or not it’s a risk you’re willing to take?  No one can tell you what to do if they’re not going to put their money where their mouths are.  At least if you caught covid as a young person, your health risks are small and covid treatment is still covered by government funding, where vaccine side effect treatment are covered by no one.  Besides, I already caught covid last fall and literally my only symptom was lost of smell and taste.  No fever, no coughing, not even a tinge of lethargy.  If not for my positive test and loss of taste and smell, I wouldn’t havent have even noticed my infection.  As a recovered patient with natural immunity, the vaccines offered me little if any additional benefit, while incurring potential risks of side effects.  I’m not sure taking the vaccine was a reasonable risk assessment, yet I took it anyway.  

Anyway, check this out:

&gt; High school senior Emma Burkey received her “one and done” Johnson &amp; Johnson coronavirus vaccine on March 20, and within two weeks was in an induced coma following seizures and clotting in her brain.

&gt;She’s making a slow recovery, having recently been transfered from the hospital to a rehabilitation center, and the first round of bills totaled $513,000. The 18-year-old’s family friends in the Las Vegas area started a GoFundMe account to help with medical expenses from the very rare vaccine reaction.

&gt; **Burkey’s family can’t look to J&amp;J to cover the medical costs not picked up by her insurance because a 2005 law -- extended last year to include the Covid-19 pandemic -- shields manufacturers and health-care providers from state and federal liability in instances of public health and bioterrorism emergencies.**

Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/ news/articles/2021-05-03/victims-of-rare-vaccine-injury-wait-to-see-if-u-s-fund-will-pay

Her gofundme is linked in that article.  Her vaccine side effect cost $513,000 to treat, yet her gofundme only managed to raise less than $60,000.  If the pharma company that developed the vaccine is not willing to risk being liable, and insurance companies aren’t willing to risk being liable, why aren’t individuals allowed to reject the vaccine also to not risk the liabilities?  Why shame the hesitant not wanting to assume full liability, while mot shaming the pharma and insurance companies not willing to take the same risks?

Why isn’t everyone who is pushing for others to be vaccinated pitching in to her gofundme as a show of faith and support?  The vaccine hesitant see all of this.  They see how the risks of taking the vaccine were understated, even when we were guaranteed with such confidence that all the risks were shown in the safety trials.  Pfizer says they’re “looking into” all these side effects now, but why didn’t they look into them before they started pushing for everyone to get vaccinated with such an unearned sense of confidence?  Why did they insist the safety trials told the full story when it’s clear now that they did not?

So no, offering someone $50 to get vaccinated or a lottery isn’t going to do much to convince someone who is concerned for her health and safety.  And every time they try to tell you why they’re hesitant, they get told they’re 5G selfish trump-worshiping morons who are simply playing politics and being big babies.  It just feels to them like you’re not listening to them, and that you’re more interested in pummeling a straw man than address their concerns in an earnest good faith attempt to empathize with their source of hesitancy.

And then to say they ought to basically be forced through punitive social engineering measures to take a vaccine they just don’t feel comfortable or safe taking feels like bullying and shaming instead of simply addressing their concerns and treating them like human beings.  

So no, you don’t sound like you’ve made an honest attempt to understand their concerns.

By November 2019, the coronavirus had probably infected a small number of people in Wuhan, scientists say. The city bustled with activity, creating endless paths that a virus could travel. 

On Nov. 2, a handful of Italian exchange students sat down at bright blue desks at a Wuhan university to try their hand at Chinese calligraphy. The next week, 2,000 people clad in “hanfu,” the flowing ancient Chinese robes, converged at the Yellow Crane Tower for a festival. Later in November, some 200,000 people, including visitors from 20 countries, toured an agricultural expo.

That month, a Chinese wildlife conservation scientist made a routine visit to the Huanan market he had tracked for two years and confirmed it was still selling wild animals in poor hygienic conditions, as his team later wrote in the Scientific Reports journal.And on Nov. 19, 2019, the Wuhan Institute of Virology held an annual staff safety training session. Deputy director of security Hu Qian discussed safety problems found during audits over the past year, according to a post on the institute’s website. 

The institute did not respond to questions on what kind of safety lapses were found in the audits. Its leadership has vehemently denied having encountered SARS-CoV-2 before the pandemic or the occurrence of any lab leaks.

The WHO report called the theory of a lab leak starting the pandemic “extremely unlikely.” A number of scientists have since said they believed it remained a possibility, including Jesse Bloom, a computational biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.“The origins of SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear, with the two plausible theories being a natural zoonosis or a lab accident,” Bloom said.

The origin search has been hobbled by scarce early information, some of it unreliable or missing.The online archives of two local state-run newspapers, the Hubei Daily and Chutian Metro Daily, can no longer be accessed before Nov. 5, 2019, according to checks by The Post. The newspapers’ publisher did not respond to a request for comment.Bloom made waves last month when he announced that he recovered 13 early coronavirus genetic sequences that had been deleted from a database by researchers in Wuhan for unknown reasons.

“As scientists, we need to find ways to obtain more data about the earliest cases,” he said.Pond, the Temple University professor, says Bloom’s paper underscored just how little data exists on the early days of the pandemic. Those recovered sequences fill some gaps in their reconstruction of how the virus evolved, strengthening the theory that the Huanan market wasn’t the sole source of the outbreak, he said.

“Even as few as 13 new sequences, which if you think about it, is a tiny amount, can fairly substantially modify the understanding of the pandemic origin,” Pond said.",,,1625779561,{},h4iqg6d,True,t3_oggsbv,False,False,t1_h4iq7jb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oggsbv/from_wuhan_to_paris_to_milan_the_search_for/h4iqg6d/,1625978651,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

-  Most kids are unvaccinated.

- COVID-19 is more contagious now than it has ever been.  (We used to talk about 10-15 minutes of exposure being of concern, now we’re talking seconds.) 

- Until kids are vaccinated, infections will disproportionately occur in kids.

- A small fraction of a large enough number is a large number.  Even if few kids get seriously ill, if many are infected then many will suffer.

- The context of this discussion is school, where a very large number of unvaccinated kids will be exposed.

Medicine isn't just about running a bunch of tests, seeing which numbers look too big or too small, and taking that as the gospel.

But also, the vaccine is 90% effective so it’s not an entirely accurate argument to say only unvaccinated people are at risk. You still wouldn’t want to sit next to someone with covid for example. So I can see a company like Uber asking people to mask up to protect drivers and other passengers. 

But overall we are moving in that direction. Most states have lifted mandates either in part or full. And the more people we get vaccinated, the safer it is for everyone.

Actually it makes no sense at all. It’s a proxy for community spread, it’s just stupid. 

&gt; Restrictions can't be left in place forever to protect a small minority.

Some can and should be. Restrictions become regulations when they’ve been extended over a long period of time. Do you want to argue that we shouldn’t regulate business? Requiring businesses to continue to accommodate populations vulnerable to covid should continue until it’s no longer spreading.

&gt; If you look at the data you can see that case numbers don't matter much anymore because hospitalizations and deaths are still very low because the vaccine works

They don’t matter to governments that think in terms of populations. You’re an individual though, so not sure why you’re endorsing a way of think that doesn’t care if you, personally, live or die as long as you don’t represent a large enough trend. 

&gt; Taken together, this means high cases numbers among healthy people is actually a great thing because they will recover and be immune for long enough until they can get a vaccine.

What a ridiculous statement and wrong in so many ways. High case rates means more opportunities to mutate and create variants. Unvaccinated people that are infected are much more susceptible to long hauling covid, even with mild cases. Infected people can infect other people. Even healthy people die of covid. Do you need more reasons that high case numbers aren’t a good thing?

&gt; England must be very close to herd immunity by now, which is the goal for reopening completely.

So the metric for herd immunity is literally the rate of spread, the replication number or R0. That’s how it’s determined. So if the goal of reopening is when herd immunity is achieved then you’ve contradicted your opening position and agreed with me. 

So what if I were to put it this way: They should reopen when herd immunity is reached, not just when some arbitrary number of people are vaccinated.  Even though that’s not as extreme as I’d like where R is nil it would at least be rational and I wouldn’t have the same criticisms.",,,1625738728,{},h4ghaoi,False,t3_og0dzy,False,True,t1_h4g9ign,/r/Coronavirus/comments/og0dzy/covid19_for_us_its_not_freedom_day_is_it/h4ghaoi/,1625934373,-4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

One approach is a Global Health Service (like UK NHS).  It would need to be funded by all countries that wish to participate, contributing a set % of GDP.

This fund could be used to contribute towards, health campaigns, co-ordinated buying of vaccines and research.

So only a couple of issues.  Taking Europe, which has fewer cultural differences than UK, China, Brazil, Zimbabwe and Iran.  There were and are huge differences and approaches between what people were doing.  The EU had massive issues, were much slower to respond and globally politics was a part of all Covid approaches.

Will countries pay?  There are issues with NATO funding, wealthy nations (like Germany) don't contribute required amounts.

Will countries want to be a part of it?  The UK could have been part of the EU vaccination effort, it decided to go its own route because it wasn't allowed to do things like continue the Oxford vaccine efforts.  Also it felt it could be more flexible on it's own than part of a group.  Would US and China join, giving up their autonomy?

Who decides which vaccines are best choices?  There were over 100 candidates this time last year, UK picked about 7.

Who gets money for research, infrastructure of factories,  payment for production, which vaccines are backed (France and UK really wanted a vaccine of their own, worked out for UK but cost Europe a lot of diverted funds appeasing France).

Delta is &gt;50% of new cases in Arkansas. There were 1,000 new cases today. Over 3,000 new cases last week. Largest increase in hospitalizations since January. 

As of July 1st, the Delta variant hadn’t been confirmed in Travis County. You have a bit before you’ll start seeing this. And, how bad it is will depend on vaccination rates. Arkansas and the SW part of Missouri have low full vaccination rates. 

There was a fully vaccinated family in Tulsa who all caught Delta variant covid at the same time. 

All the signs are there. Delta is going to be far worse, at least in low vaccination areas, than what we saw previously.

I've been reaching out to individuals who are hesitant and having nonjudgmental discussions with them. I did my damn part. I've been working toward normal for over a year and need to move on!

It sucks that so many people have been brainwashed not to get vaccinated. I worry about the people in my life who are vulnerable and refuse to get it, like my best friends' parents and some of my extended family members. But it's freaking time to live a normal life again, at least in a country where anyone who is eligible can get vaccinated.

In that case a middle of the road unexpected virus won out because it caused different a symptom profile.  It’s very counter intuitive at times how viruses work. 

But like you said I agree that people should be careful in between doses.   I just think that it’s a numbers game.   We are exponentially more likely to get a mutation from communities that have rapid unchecked covid spread.   

Additionally I think that with a partially vaccinated person who gets covid that once covid establishes itself it’s not getting spit out as some super bug because it “broke through their defenses”.  It doesn’t mean that it took some super covid to get in and therefore they are incubating the strongest version of covid. It just means that their bodies failed to mount a sufficient response.   I get the Darwin theory but it’s a novel virus and the vaccines aren’t perfect.   Some people’s bodies just don’t fend it off.   It doesn’t mean that what got through was like the strongest swimming sperm that got to the egg.  

In the end it’s just a statistically more likely that even with a partial dose a mild case of covid that your body clears out faster should have millions less multitudes of times to replicate.

We had a long period of gradual exponential decay that has had a very noticeable inflection point for a clear reason (new variant with significantly higher R0 rate). 

The same predictable growth happened happened with the Alpha variant in mid-Spring - but it was outpaced by vaccines. Unfortunately our vaccine uptake has declined to noise levels so that will not be there to lower the Rt rate in the short run, and behavior changes are unlikely in the short run as well. 

COVID on long horizons is terribly unpredictable; but on short term horizons such as this (e.g., the next 4-6 weeks), it is pretty easy to forecast if there are no behavior changes or other exogenous factors that change. 

This is not a sky is falling prognostication; there will be no repeat of Winter 2020 with 3000 people dying daily. We'll see a significant uptick in cases and a material uptick in hospitalizations and deaths, but the latter will still remain relatively muted compared to most of the COVID history due to a large portion of the most vulnerable population protected with vaccines. 

On a ratio basis, hospitalizations will rise more than deaths because more older people are vaccinated than younger ones. Under 50s are significantly less likely to die of COVID, but they are hospitalized relatively commonly (a 40-49 year old has 2% the death rate of 85+, but 25% of the hospitalization rate of someone 85+). 

Apparent death rate and hospitalization rate will likely rise because the unvaccinated are less likely to get tested. It is unlikely that IFR has risen with Delta, but it is likely that the apparent CFR will increase for this reason.

Looks like this ruling says:

&gt; Accordingly, the involuntary anthrax vaccine program, as applied to all persons, is rendered illegal absent informed consent **or a Presidential waiver**.""

So it seems like the military can still require a EUA COVID vaccine, but only under a specific condition that hasn't been met.

https://www.justsecurity.org/75729/should-the-covid-19-vaccine-be-required-for-the-military/

&gt; Can military members be legally required to receive the COVID-19 vaccination?

&gt; Ultimately, yes—but this answer requires a bit of nuance and process....

&gt; ... But, according to the law, the president can waive this informed consent requirement if he determines that it is “in the interest of national security” to do so. While Biden has not done this, some members of Congress have called upon him to do just that.

&gt; If this informed consent provision is ultimately waived, military commanders can clearly order military members in their command to receive the vaccine. This is consistent with the “Failure to obey an order or regulation” under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Even if the informed provision is not waived by Biden, a mandatory military vaccination order may survive challenges in military criminal courts implementing the UCMJ. Federal civil courts would likely scrutinize such a move much more closely.

You need a specific or enough viral load to get infected.

While it's neat they found its airborne, the article doesn't say how airborne or if it can infect via that vector alone. They just detected it.

The entire point of masks, plexiglass and every measure was to lesson droplet and airborne spread in the air. The largest concern was droplet, but droplets also hang in the air to, as does the virus as illustrated and think we knew for quite a while that air not circulating quick enough in a building leads to more infections as you are concentrating the viral load in the air more and more.

So while people give sparky replies like a virus can turn a corner... it kind of entirely misses the point. The 2M thing is dumb, but 1M also works, and so does 3M.

It's reducing the overall chance of spread, because while it may be airborne it will be really airborne around someone infected, and fall off as distance increases. 

But it was pretty early on people focused heavily on HVAC so I'm not sure why everyone in this thread is going almost to conspiracy thread... this was all known and this new article just says they proved it again, but not how much was detected or if it can actually infect someone.

This is why people were getting down voted about airborne spread.

Not that it isn't airborne, but that people insinuate things like X is theater.

That isn't what the article says or science says.

To be infected you need a specific amount or average amount of viral load. It doesn't matter if covid is or is not airborne if it can't infect you.

In the overall concentration is very small, an infection will not set it.

The point of masks is to slow air/reduce the amount you are breathing out. Likewise it slows air and reduces the amount of viruses you breathe in.

Plexiglass slows air going directly at someone for hvac to circulate out of a building.

2M is still the distance, and guess what? 1M distance would also work. 3M would work even better.

Guidelines are suggestions based on reduction of the chance you'll be infected.

The measures taken lesson the amount of virus that makes it to the air(masks) as does any barrier or filter, hvacs being upgraded, filters, exchanging air more etc etc etc.

Nothing is theater, but in the end most people take a bit of something they read and run with it. But in the end plexiglass should have been their prior, hope it stays.

There is no reason a barrier shouldn't exist when adult children spit, throw shit at workers, hop counters and really it does reduce other types of transmission for other viruses to.

There’s still millions of perfect targets for the virus.

AND, no distancing, no masking, plus much more transmissible virus.

Which way does the scale tip?

Off the bat the virus is 2.25x as transmissible, so just on that nationally there’s more possibility for spread than there was with the last two waves.

Then you subtract masking, distancing, and add in much more movement around the country, snd to top it off the national return of fully packed classrooms this fall.

All that together makes it pretty likely that we will have not only a similar curve when it comes to growth, but possibly in overall cases too.

Only 34m Americans have had covid so far, and another 157m Americans have been vaccinated.

That leaves 137m Americans who are vulnerable to the illness.

Sure there are unknown cases, but there are also people who have been ill, known or unknown, who have gotten a vaccine, and given the current growth rates in the minimally vaccinated areas I think it’s a fair assumption to say that there’s not a ton of unknown natural immunity. If there were the low uptake counties would have similar current rates of infection as the heavily vaccinated counties.

So 1/3 the hosts, but 2.25x as transmissible, and practically zero NPI’s.

They only had 1 case in June? You don't say.  They also had only 27 cases total last June according to worldometer.

 San Marino study and **published** data from Argentina, as I said, are very small. It's better than nothing, but not nearly sufficient for vaccine given out in millions of doses in the middle of pandemic. Ongoing clinical trials from UAE and India you have posted are also tiny, they cannot capture serious side effects, if those are (hopefully) rare enough.  Everything else you and the ""article"" cite are not evidence, but *statements.* Press releases, government statements without actual data, conjectures from Ginzburg or whoever – it's not scientific evidence of anything. Let me give you an example of [actual evidence](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.08.21252200v1). 

Also, these insinuations of ""smearing"", ""fud"" or ""competing political interests"" are hurtful and counter–productive. As I clearly stated, I have a vested personal interest in Sputnik V being ""safe and effective"", as my personal well-being, as well as my relatives, my friends and my countrymen, depends on it. That doesn't mean we shouldn't strive to get as much information as possible about just how safe and effective Sputnik V or any other vaccines are. So in light of this I find Nature publishing thinly veiled Russian state press releases unacceptable. 

P.S. As luck would have it, I was visiting my grandmother today and I caught evening news on ""Russia 1""(which I normally would never see) They ran a whole piece on Covid, starting with talking about how many people are sick, showing people on ventilators, then stating that doctors recommend vaccination and culminating in showing a screenshot of the article we are discussing  with a claim of ""scientific article about safety and efficacy of sputnik v was just published in Nature"".

Another will live in terror inside his house and not go outside, bleaches his groceries, and is struggling with depression, but won't get vaccinated because his dad told him the vaccines don't work.  Okay, good call.  Just stay inside like a hermit.

If you want to read more about the state of informed consent in military medicine, I'd recommend this paper:

Academic emergency medicine 12.11 (2005): 1120-1126.--*Informed consent in military research shares many of the same fundamental principles and regulations that govern civilian biomedical research. In fact, much of modern research ethics is grounded in events that occurred in the context of war or government-sponsored research.*

So the military can require that you get appropriate medical treatments that are considered safe for mainstream use when those treatments impact combat readiness (e.g. getting relevant, approved vaccines before travelling overseas).

The majority of new cases are in the country's coronavirus epicentre HCM City (with 915 cases) and southern provinces – Bình Dương (135), Đồng Tháp (108), Khánh Hoà (28), Phú Yên (24), Vĩnh Long (17), An Giang (11), Cà Mau (11), Bình Phước (3), Trà Vinh (2), Kiên Giang (1), Bình Thuận (1), Bến Tre (1), Tây Ninh (1), and Hậu Giang (1).  
  
Some Central Highlands and central region provinces also reported new community cases – Quảng Ngãi (14), Lâm Đồng (3), Gia Lai (3), and Nghệ An (1).  
  
Three northern localities with stabilising situations recorded single-digit rises in local cases – Bắc Ninh with eight patients, Bắc Giang with nine, and Hà Nội with five.  
  
There were also seven imported COVID-19 cases detected today.  
  
All in all, Việt Nam’s ongoing fourth wave of infections that emerged since late April, characterised by the dominance of highly infectious Delta variant of coronavirus, has reached 20,863 cases, pushing the national tally since the beginning of the pandemic past the 24,000 mark (currently at 24,385 confirmed cases).  
  
The health ministry also reported 393 recoveries, bringing the country’s total to 8,950.  
  
105 COVID-19 fatalities have been recorded in Việt Nam so far, 70 in the fourth wave.  
  
HCM City lockdown

HCM City will enter strict lockdown for 15 days starting Friday (July 9) 0:00, with measures like ordering people to stay at home unless for necessary trips outside and closures of non-essential businesses, in a bid to contain the escalating virus outbreak that has now resulted in over 9,000 cases here.  
  
At Thursday's Government meeting, health minister Nguyễn Thanh Long said Việt Nam would receive some 8.7 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines in July, and the priority will be given to HCM City along with southern provinces that are in a critical situation.  
  
HCM City has been told to arrange vaccination in multiple time frames at various small-scale vaccination sites, to avoid a repeat of overcrowding scenes that occurred in the mass campaign last month.  
The health ministry would send 30 mobile vaccination vehicles to HCM City to provide the jabs to certain neighbourhoods, Long said. — VNS",,,1625755295,{},h4h84e3,True,t3_og8l0k,False,True,t3_og8l0k,/r/Coronavirus/comments/og8l0k/vietnam_record_1307_local_covid19_infections/h4h84e3/,1625949609,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

How COVID-19 damages the brain is becoming clearer. New evidence suggests that the coronavirus’s assault on the brain could be multipronged: it might attack certain brain cells directly, reduce blood flow to brain tissue or trigger production of immune molecules that can harm brain cells.  
  
Infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 can cause memory loss, strokes and other effects on the brain. The question, says Serena Spudich, a neurologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, is: “Can we intervene early to address these abnormalities so that people don’t have long-term problems?”

“The researchers found elevations of C5b9 in pediatric  patients with severe COVID-19 and MIS-C, but to their surprise, they also found that C5b9 was elevated in patients with minimal or asymptomatic disease. Of the 22 patients for whom complete data were available, 19 (86%) met the criteria for TMA [thrombotic microangiopathy]. Additionally, sC5b9 levels were elevated both in patients who did and did not meet criteria for TMA. Although most children with COVID-19 do not have severe disease, our study shows that there may be other effects of SARS-CoV-2 that are worthy of investigation.”

“Methods: We retrospectively investigated patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 but who did not show any symptoms. Among the 139 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Yeungnam University Hopistal in Daegu, South Korea, 10 (7.2%) were asymptomatic. Their chest CT and radiographic findings were analyzed. Results: In the results, all patients (100%) had ground-glass opacity (GGO) on chest CT. Further, the GGO lesions were predominantly distributed peripherally and posteriorly in all patients. In 9 (90%) patients, the GGO lesions were combined with reticular opacity.”

This study (including a control group with n~5000) may be an interesting read. Mild-moderate acute stage. 15% reported moderate to severe symptoms &gt;8 months post infection.

Comparing seropositive vs seronegative participants, 26% vs 9% reported at least 1 moderate to severe symptom lasting for at least 2 months (RR, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.2-3.8]) and 15% vs 3% reported at least 1 moderate to severe symptom lasting for at least 8 months (RR, 4.4 [95% CI, 2.9-6.7]) (Table). The most common moderate to severe symptoms lasting for at least 2 months in the seropositive group were anosmia, fatigue, ageusia, and dyspnea.

&gt; Two doses of BNT162b2 are highly effective across all age groups (≥16 years, including older adults aged ≥85 years) in preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospitalisations, severe disease, and death, including those caused by the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant.

&gt;In a multistate network of U.S. hospitals during January–March 2021, receipt of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines was 94% effective against COVID-19 hospitalization among fully vaccinated adults and 64% effective among partially vaccinated adults aged ≥65 years.

There’s a doc in the Tulsa area who continues to claim masks are harmful. You can get a book from his website that explains why. But wait, there’s more! His immune supplements will protect you.

My pulmonologist is in the Tulsa area. My last appointment I was strongly encouraged to remove my mask. Not for a breathing test, but because all the staff are supposedly vaccinated. None of the staff was masked. This particular doc advertises for symptomatic people to get tested for covid at his office. They do have a separate waiting area for sick patients similar to what pediatricians often do. Not very effective for something like the Delta variant.

All anyone asked is that you wear a god damn mask. That was basically the whole thing. You go to costco? Wear a mask. Because you don't know if you're contagious when you first get it, you could walk around for a week spreading it before you know to stay home. If everyone wore masks it would've basically halted the virus. But you're special, right? You know better - somehow you're so in tune with your body you'd know the moment you're infectious? Right?

It's your right to not wear a mask, generally speaking. But...and here's the whole thing that you folks can't seem to get through your thick skulls...it's not your right to infect me with a deadly virus. Your risky behavior shouldn't be my problem.

Cite your source, then. I'd love to read it. 

&gt;we have done the same risk/benefit analysis

Really? Because if you had, you'd realize the 'risk' from getting vaccinated is effectively *zero*. Any cost/benefit analysis with a numerator in the hundredths of decimal points seems like a no-brainer to me. 

&gt;but you’re wrong if you think our position or decision is unintelligent.

You're not fooling anyone. There is no reason not to get vaccinated as soon as possible. From cdc.gov: 

&gt;If I already had COVID-19 and recovered, do I still need to get vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine? 

&gt; Yes, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19. That’s because experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.

So ""we already had COVID"" is a bad excuse. 

&gt;COVID-19 vaccines were developed using science that has been around for decades.

&gt;COVID-19 vaccines are not experimental. **They went through all the required stages of clinical trials.** Extensive testing and monitoring have shown that these vaccines are safe and effective.

Emphasis mine. Meaning *there are no more* safety reviews or testing protocols. They're done. They're finished. The full approval of the vaccine cannot depend on something that they are *not* doing. 

&gt;COVID-19 vaccines have received and continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.

And we've administered ~183,000,000 doses in the US alone. Still nothing of note to report. Is 183,000,000  not a large enough sample size for you?


Whether or not you get vaccinated is up to you. Neither I nor anyone else can make you do anything. Do whatever you want.

Still, preventive measures have not yet been relaxed: masks are still mandatory, we must keep our distance, there are still some cities in lockdown, etc.

Tomorrow the authorities will announce some changes to our national Covid plan ""Paso a Paso"" (""Step by Step""), and it's expected that they'll grant some liberties for vaccinated people.

Until we can get vaccines that are authorized for younger children and widely used, they (and those that can but don't get the vaccine) are the population in which mutations will most likely arise - protecting them via other measures (distancing/masking/etc) helps to decrease that amount of replication (and thus mutation) that goes on in that population and thus decreases the risk of worse variants arising. What measures are sufficient or needed can be debated, but the fact that unvaccinated populations (including children for which none is approved) are the largest risk for worse variants to arise from is a fact.

While it is possible for vaccinated people to catch and have a more mild case, it's important to note that the mild case is also accompanied with lower viral titers. That means less replication is going on, and thus lower levels of mutations compared to an infection in an unvaccinated individual.

In the U.S. it’s sort of the same dynamic as the U.K. From my perspective, as a person who is immunocompromised, there are a variety of factors that have resulted in the disregard for the safety of people in my position. 

1. It’s unlikely we will reach herd immunity because of things like misinformation, individual risk factors, and fear of the vaccine, possibly even apathy in some cases. One important thing I have noticed is that risk is rather relative, and thus so is safety, if you yourself are unlikely to experience a negative consequence due to an action you are more likely to go through with it. It is more likely you won’t die from covid if you have a good immune system, are young and in relatively good health. Although the risk of death is never zero, some people may not bother to get the vaccine. There are also people who don’t seem to care that others are at risk and that being vaccinated could help reduce the spread of the virus. 

2. A desire for normalcy. Many people simply do not bother with taking precautions because they themselves are not at risk, and nobody close to them is. However, there are also those people who do not care they themselves are at risk and also people who simply do not care they could harm others. It’s more apathy than malice from my view point.

3. The necessity/desire to rejuvenate the economy. When people don’t spend money, the economy falters. Poverty can also be dangerous and for some people, the pandemic is the lesser of the two evils. 

I’m sure there’s many more reasons but that’s what I’ve come up with so far.

Vaccinated people aren’t really a measles risk to other vaccinated people. But an unvaccinated person with measles can be so contagious that they transmit measles to vaccinated people, in so called “breakthrough” infections.


Bulletproof vests are great at turning what might be a fatal gunshot wound into a giant bruise and a couple cracked or broken ribs.

They don’t prevent you from getting hit by a bullet though, and there is still a chance you could get hit in the neck. They also don’t protect you if you get hit by something like a .50 BMG round, and no body armor is going to protect you if you get hit by a tank main gun.

So why do people wear them? Because they save lives. Because they work well. Because no one expects a vest to protect them from a tank, and no one expects to be working security and having a tank show up.

“The researchers found elevations of C5b9 in pediatric  patients with severe COVID-19 and MIS-C, but to their surprise, they also found that C5b9 was elevated in patients with minimal or asymptomatic disease. Of the 22 patients for whom complete data were available, 19 (86%) met the criteria for TMA [thrombotic microangiopathy]. Additionally, sC5b9 levels were elevated both in patients who did and did not meet criteria for TMA. Although most children with COVID-19 do not have severe disease, our study shows that there may be other effects of SARS-CoV-2 that are worthy of investigation.”

“Methods: We retrospectively investigated patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 but who did not show any symptoms. Among the 139 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Yeungnam University Hopistal in Daegu, South Korea, 10 (7.2%) were asymptomatic. Their chest CT and radiographic findings were analyzed. Results: In the results, all patients (100%) had ground-glass opacity (GGO) on chest CT. Further, the GGO lesions were predominantly distributed peripherally and posteriorly in all patients. In 9 (90%) patients, the GGO lesions were combined with reticular opacity.”

This study (including a control group with n~5000) may be an interesting read. Mild-moderate acute stage. 15% reported moderate to severe symptoms &gt;8 months post infection.

Comparing seropositive vs seronegative participants, 26% vs 9% reported at least 1 moderate to severe symptom lasting for at least 2 months (RR, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.2-3.8]) and 15% vs 3% reported at least 1 moderate to severe symptom lasting for at least 8 months (RR, 4.4 [95% CI, 2.9-6.7]) (Table). The most common moderate to severe symptoms lasting for at least 2 months in the seropositive group were anosmia, fatigue, ageusia, and dyspnea.

Comparing US with UK, and when we are seeing something like 88% effectiveness with two doses and 33% with one dose. The US is pretty much on par with the top vaccine rate countries with fully vaccinated population, and the only island countries really or very small countries have higher rates. But more importantly look at vaccination rates when the Delta variant became dominant in the UL vs US. in the UK it became dominant beginning of may when UK only had 25% of people fully vaccinated. While if the Delta Variant is dominant in the US as of now, we have almost 50% of people fully vaccinated, with it skewing higher in the west where the variant is seen as most dominant as California has 51%, Oregon and Washington have 55% of the population fully vaccinated. But going back to beginning of may, the US had 35% fully vaccinated when the UK only had 25% which is a significant difference. But you also have most of the major metro areas in the west having 65% fully vaccination rate. 

Now go further beyond that and compare London borough area with the western US metros. They’re reporting that only 52% of adults (18+) are fully vaccinated.
