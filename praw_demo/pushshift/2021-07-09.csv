Here's some light reading about the effects of asymptomatic and mild/moderate cases. It seems that there's a lot we're still discovering about the effects of Covid-19 and their duration. Asymptomatic doesn't equal an absence of ill effects.

“The researchers found elevations of C5b9 in patients with severe COVID-19 and MIS-C, but to their surprise, they also found that C5b9 was elevated in patients with minimal or asymptomatic disease. Of the 22 patients for whom complete data were available, 19 (86%) met the criteria for TMA [thrombotic microangiopathy]. Additionally, sC5b9 levels were elevated both in patients who did and did not meet criteria for TMA. Although most children with COVID-19 do not have severe disease, our study shows that there may be other effects of SARS-CoV-2 that are worthy of investigation.”

“Methods: We retrospectively investigated patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 but who did not show any symptoms. Among the 139 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Yeungnam University Hopistal in Daegu, South Korea, 10 (7.2%) were asymptomatic. Their chest CT and radiographic findings were analyzed. Results: In the results, all patients (100%) had ground-glass opacity (GGO) on chest CT. Further, the GGO lesions were predominantly distributed peripherally and posteriorly in all patients. In 9 (90%) patients, the GGO lesions were combined with reticular opacity.”

This study (including a control group with n~5000) may be an interesting read. Mild-moderate acute stage. 15% reported moderate to severe symptoms &gt;8 months post infection.

Comparing seropositive vs seronegative participants, 26% vs 9% reported at least 1 moderate to severe symptom lasting for at least 2 months (RR, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.2-3.8]) and 15% vs 3% reported at least 1 moderate to severe symptom lasting for at least 8 months (RR, 4.4 [95% CI, 2.9-6.7]) (Table).

You need to be personally evaluated because believe it or not, at least for the time being, there are risks that need to be considered. It's no different than why your doctor or emergency medical staff need to know if you currently take *other* medication because there are real complications.

True, but even in Europe, they still have a 30-40% unvaccinated population.  So the hospitals will still fill up, with the unvaccinated.

Do we let that happen and then start turning people away from hospitals?  I don't think anyone will stomach that.

Or do we lock down hard again when the hospitals are full yet again?  Nobody wants that.

Maybe we should maintain some sensible light rules (no indoor rooms with 500 people in them for 2 hours dancing and yelling) - so that the hospitals aren't totally full at some point.

My wife and I are vaccinated but 2.5 year old daughter is not. We have not done anything with her all year and thought with  vaccination rates pretty good in New England area and low positivity rates (under 1%) that an outdoor aquirium would be safe. We would love if she would wear a mask but she hates it. We just have done no activities where one would be remotely needed until this.

It was so much more crowded than we expected. We waited until people cleared away from viewing spots and moved out if anyone walked close by. We walked quickly and around folks with as much distance as possible. I held her most of the time so was able to get around quick. She was then well above the height of little (who would also be unvaccinated) children.

She loved even the limited viewing of sea lions, whales and other animals. So we are happy we went but of course will regret it greatly if this is what gets her COVID after 1.5 years of her seeing noone but her parents (and folks outside from afar during walks and recently her vaccinated grandparents).

For better and for worse, those kind of images aren't very common anymore.

Because of logistics, I doubt that we'll see videos of very many COVID patients struggling and dying in the ICU. You would need the patient (and maybe family) to consent to a press/info release. The hospital would also need to be okay with it, and they would likely bounce that request to PR and legal teams who would likely discourage the idea due to HIPAA and liability exposure. Additionally, hospital systems and all trying to increase elective surgeries as much as possible to preserve hospital revenue, and a foreboding image of death in the ICU isn't going to encourage people to come to the hospital for their 100% elective surgery. Altogether, there are a ton of logistical hurdles and disincentives that that make it hard to get out images of an actual patient in the hospital.

Probably not. But expect hospital ICUs will get crowded, surgeries cancelled and all that. Polish hospitals might do well to plan for this.

From ecdc data around 40% of over 80 year olds in Poland are not vaccinated and there is very little difference in numbers between full and partial vacination so it likely is the elderly who do not want, not lack of access. 

Also, vaccination does not totally protect, it protects much better groups, the herd. But it is what can be done.

* A senior administrator at a western Russian clinic has been detained on suspicion of **selling fake coronavirus vaccine certificates**, police said Wednesday.

The virus is literally particles not continuous things. If you do not have a lot of infected people with delta around or if they are staying home, no superspreader events. India had very few cases for over a year, we were all assigning it to a lot of reasons, will well, they got cases.

&gt;Should l get prepared for another wave? 

We have seen covid reach everywhere. I think sooner or later evert single country is going to get a boom of cases caused by delta, sooner or later. It is a race between delta and vaccination, maybe places like Malta or Iceland can escape it, but low vaccination countries on the mainland of Europe, they will get it sooner or later. Pay particular attention to unvaccinated young people holidaying outside and returning, sooner or later one is going to pass delta to a lot of his mates at some party, legal or ilegal.

Poland has lots of available vaccines around right?

Check out this 
[great article about how unlikely it is for ""long term"" side effects from the vaccines to show up a few months or years later.](https://www.chop.edu/news/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine)

The J&amp;J vaccine manufacturing mixup that you heard about [isn't a problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/mhhf8x/johnson_johnson_statement_on_us_covid19_vaccine/) There are no tainted or flawed doses from J&amp;J being distributed, all our doses of J&amp;J came from a different manufacturer in the Netherlands and are both safe and effective.

Vaccines given EUA are safe even if you hear about [clotting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mh39g4/blood_clots_and_the_az_vaccine_revisited/) or [growing a third arm.](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/12/04/get-ready-for-false-side-effects)

That the vaccine manufacturers are not liable (you can't sue them, etc.) if you die from their Covid vaccine is a [logical error], that's [true of all vaccines, and really, most medical practices/drugs/etc.]  They just have to warn you about potential risks, [which they actually do a good job of, even though those risks are miniscule.]  Note that this would also be the case (you can't sue them if it hurts you) for any future ""cures"", therapeutics, or other treatments for the disease. 

The vaccine isn't killing anyone. You heard wrong.  Great discussion [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/oc45h0/scientists_quit_journal_board_protesting_grossly/) 

Clotting is so rare from the vaccine and so common from the virus, it's basically not worth talking about.

Should we be excited about a vaccine [that's not 90%+ effective?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lv3h8e/daily_discussion_thread_march_01_2021/gpbwgkf/) Excellent question!

There’s no such thing as vaccine side effects that take [months or years before they start to show up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k96ng0/how_is_it_possible_to_create_a_safe_and_effective/gfldup9/) If there [is](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lxfna2/daily_discussion_thread_march_04_2021/gpoqzl6/) a side effect, [it usually shows up right away.](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2017/0615/p786.html)  Thousands of phase 2 trial participants have had the vaccine for over 12 months, and there are [no worrying, lingering, or delayed side effects.](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/covid-19-vaccine-myths-debunked)

Immunity from infection lasts [*at least 8 months*](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/koxkm1/sarscov2_infection_induces_longlived_bone_marrow/), though [probably a lot longer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/klpvp7/sarscov2specific_t_cell_memory_is_longlasting_in/)  Again, [*at least* 8 months,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ldj06f/immunological_memory_to_sarscov2_assessed_for_up/) though non-antibody immunity may be most important.  It's too soon to say ""lifelong"" but [that is a possibility.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4nkco/the_immune_system_mounts_a_lasting_defense_after/) Also, it looks like those who have recovered *may* only need [one dose of an mRNA vaccine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/labst4/robust_spike_antibody_responses_and_increased/). There are some people (~7%) who don't develop lasting immunity from infections, but it's not clear to me now whether vaccines would develop lasting immunity for these people. 

Immunity from the vaccine [lasts *at least 6 months*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l9nfu8/stable_neutralizing_antibody_levels_six_months/) probably a lot,[ lot longer,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6a6pq/durability_of_responses_after_sarscov2_mrna1273/)  probably many years. It's looking like it'll be permanent or [semi-permanent in a good portion](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m1xbz4/sarscov2_mrna_vaccines_induce_a_robust_germinal/) of the population.

Vaccine induced immunity is [comparable to](https://www.verywellhealth.com/antibodies-from-vaccines-and-from-natural-infection-5092564), or [better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l5whhu/increased_resistance_of_sarscov2_variants_b1351/), or a [LOT better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m8m23c/neutralizing_antibodies_against_sarscov2_variants/), immunity from a previous infection. Especially to [Alpha/Beta.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgxpre/vaccineinduced_immunity_provides_more_robust/)

The OG SARS virus (SARS-CoV-1) from 2003 gave detectable immunity [both 6](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/12/7264) and [12 years later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kvbz9y/weekly_question_thread/gizs32j/)   

Vaccination and previous infection [reduce viral load, which reduces spread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s). Updated info [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ocygyp/vast_majority_of_breakthrough_infections_in/)

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) article does a good job of explaining the likelihood of vaccines *at least* reducing spread.  [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lf744r/daily_discussion_thread_february_08_2021/gml0gyi/) may help too. Data from [Scotland looks great](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m3tx1n/covid19_vaccine_linked_to_a_reduction_in/). 

[""Moderna vaccine blocks &gt;90% (87-93%) of infections &amp; 91% (89-94%) of transmission.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmqfk4q/)

 This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a great reduction in ability to spread the virus. [Maybe even with just one dose!](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242) You should [get both doses though.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m2mtnv/immune_response_to_sarscov2_variants_of_concern/)

Reinfections are rare, some studies show [less than 1 in 1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kyj0bx/sarscov2_reinfection_in_a_cohort_of_43000/) (maybe in the 1 in 10,000 range, you'll have to read the study, it's awesome).  Reinfections tend to be much milder than previous infections, even those new variants. Check the [comments here](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lm0mc2/prior_covid19_significantly_reduces_the_risk_of/) for some really interesting discussion regarding reinfection.

[Delayed second doses are fine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/layx6g/single_dose_administration_and_the_influence_of/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) At least with [ChAdOx1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), though there is evidence from the mRNA vaccine trials that suggest that up to 6 weeks is better if not at least acceptable. The problem is that you have to wait longer for the second dose, and therefore, full protection. [CDC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lbiqne/daily_discussion_thread_february_03_2021/glvp1nl?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) used to say that there is no maximum interval between doses, but has recently changed. [Pfizer says not more than 6 weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/liakcb/covid19_vaccine_doses_shouldnt_be_more_than_six/). 

[Dose intervals might increase efficacy if extended past 3 or 4 weeks,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/mudvjd/questin_about_vaccine_intervals/gv58byt/) CDC says you have up to 42 days between doses (but that may be extended at some point).

Did you accidentally get mixed doses? [All good.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html)

Even if your antibodies fade over time, [you still have immunity.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/npeymo/sarscov2specific_memory_b_cells_can_persist_in/)

We shouldn’t disregard the data, but we also should give it appropriate weight in the risk-benefit analysis. 

Me personally? I think this is an important consideration and I acknowledge that this increases the risk associated with taking the vaccine. I also think that the benefits from receiving the vaccine are not even close to being eclipsed by the potential risks given their severity and frequency in the general population. My worry is that there are people who are less informed than I am who are on the fence about getting the vaccine and use this data as the excuse to avoid it without fully understanding the true risk. 

It’s my belief that the only path forward in managing this virus is through mass vaccination, so we need to proceed in a cooperative manner, meaning as many people as people need to get on board. Vaccine hesitancy is detrimental to the general populace by prolonging problems we are facing with respect to the virus, though I certainly understand why people are hesitant, and I don’t necessarily blame people for feeling that way.

 &gt;In immunology, a memory B cell (MBC) is a type of B lymphocyte that forms part of the adaptive immune system. These cells develop within germinal centers of the secondary lymphoid organs. Memory B cells circulate in the blood stream in a quiescent state, sometimes for decades. Their function is to memorize the characteristics of the antigen that activated their parent B cell during initial infection such that if the memory B cell later encounters the same antigen, it triggers an accelerated and robust secondary immune response.

Yes we do.

It is what the numbers say.  The worst period in COVID in Florida was January.  And that's the only time where the new infection rate reached near 10,000 per day. 

&gt;&gt;It is much nearer to that peak now than it was in February, March, April, May, or June

&gt;In regards to 7-day average? No.

Not sure what ""no"" means here.   What I said is correct. In terms of infection rate it has not been as bad in Feb -through June as it is now. The 7-day average never came up to 10,000 during Feb -through June.

What is the purpose of the denial?


&gt;So no, July’s current 7-day average of 3,300/day is not nearer than February, March, April, or May.

I'm talking about the newest rates that have spiked in alternate days.  The 7 day average will have to wait another 6 to 13 days...

I don’t believe masks should be enforced long term if a country is keeping cases down and have a huge vaccinated population, but don’t get why people hate it so much and it must be a “eliminate all this treachery of masks” sentiment, such a shame that a protective measure is made to be political in so many countries",,,1625944499,{},h4qbwup,False,t3_ohkfqu,False,False,t1_h4q6un7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ohkfqu/netherlands_reports_10345_new_coronavirus_cases/h4qbwup/,1626127998,23,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The semantics of the origins of the virus just still don't add up.... The main reason being that Wuhan isn't the sort of place that viruses emerge  naturally from. It's literally a city. Also, a lot of publications keep repeating this falsehood that the Huannan market sold wild animals. They did not.. they sold mostly seafood, it's literally a wet market.

This is an excuse.     The article provides additional information.  BUT as I pointed out - go to the CDC for more definitive information.  

1) In two of 10 regions the CDC monitors—one covering Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska, and the other Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming—the Delta variant already accounts for 80.7% and 74.3% of cases respectively.

2) Delta has driven a wave of new infections among unvaccinated groups in highly vaccinated countries—notably in children and young people

3) Vaccines appear to be effective at preventing serious disease from Delta, but coverage is uneven, uptake is falling and hesitancy remains high, with

See that part about ""hesitancy?"" All I asked for was to read the article.   But whole groups of people are **FAILING TO BE Vaccinated** and they are failing for no legitimate reason1""

&gt;**Here Are The Groups That Still Won’t Get The Covid Vaccine—And Why**

What I find sadest?  I that evangelicals, people who believe in God instead believe in a madman criminal who at best cheats on his taxes.  Why should people who read the Bible be this way?


And yet...

&gt;As vaccination rates continue to fall and leave the U.S. dangerously vulnerable to new outbreaks of Covid-19, polling from the Kaiser Family Foundation reveals which groups resist vaccines the most—Republicans, Evangelicals, young people lead—and why, though not all reasons stand up to scrutiny.  

&gt;The KFF poll, conducted Jun. 8-21, found Republicans (52%), uninsured under 65s (48%), white Evangelical christians (58%), young people aged 18-29 (55%) and those living in rural areas (54%) to be the groups with the lowest vaccination rates.

So there are plenty of facts and plenty of evidence.  It is not ""fear mongering"" to ask people to get vaccinated so that they don't get sick and cause other people to get sick and die.


How is asking people to get a simple vaccination - that won't cost them anything and could save their life ""fearmongering?""

Answer.  It isn't. There are people who care about this country today just as there were when we had the Salk polio vaccine and just as there were when we won World War II.

California is still going to require masks for everyone and I think California got it right this time on the best way to protect school kids from COVID-19.

First, you are going to have kids who have seen Trump and other influencers running around without masks who'll question why do they need to wear masks or get vaccinated (ignoring the fact that Trump got very, very sick from COVID-19 because he refused to wear a mask, plus later he very quietly got vaccinated).

Second, you'll have two groups of students, masked and unmasked, with the masked students basically signaling to everyone their parents are anti-vax, anti-mask very likely strongly conservatives.

But if you look at the UK stats, the death rate is MASSIVELY lower than it would have been without the vaccines (last time the case rate 7 day average was where it is now and rising we were getting 30-40 0 deaths a day, and right now we're getting a tenth of that). States that have good vaccination rates will still see delta take over as the primary variant and may see temporary case spikes, but I'm confident those states won't have anything they can't cope with. I'm much more worried about areas that do have low rates, though. This one must spread like *wildfire* in a low vax population.",,,1625869193,{},h4n33id,False,t3_oh2ya8,False,False,t1_h4mq4bi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oh2ya8/delta_variant_said_to_be_far_more_widespread_than/h4n33id/,1626063521,29,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Yes, the sequence of events that would have to occur for a lab-leak involving a novel virus to become a pandemic... that's a number I have no idea.  Black Swan event most likely.

But is it possible? Yes

Is there precedent? Yes. The labs involved previously had accidents and condemnation from WHO and the international community.

Have other labs around the world suffered similar accidents? Yes. This isn't just a China problem. It's labs everywhere. It's a human problem. That's why Gain-Of-Function studies are controversial.

Have past leaks involving coronaviruses killed or harmed people? Yes, including SARS-CoV-1 out of a P4 lab.

Have any leaks turned into a pandemic? Yes.  H1N1 in 1977.

Have any leaks from novel viruses turned into a pandemic? No

Is there evidence of lab-leak in this pandemic? No

But does that mean we should stop investigating? Of course not.

&gt;Slash-and-burn agriculture and crop rotation were known to Europe for a long time.

Slash and burn was very uncommon outside very small pockets of mesoamerica. crop rotation wasn't known in Europe so much as it was known that certain fields needed to be left fallow for a year or so while weed crops we're grown. Native Americans grew beans in those fields instead, keeping them productive while fixing nitrogen better than cover would've. They also had the ""three sisters"" method of planting where corn, beans and squash were grown side by side as permaculture, which kept the soil productive while still providing a complete diet. 
&gt; Europe had better understanding of fertilizing, used animal force for handling the land, 

They used animals that North America didn't have, and fertilized with their feces. 
&gt;used three-fields system that NA (to the best of my knowledge) never had, 

They didn't need it.
&gt;introduced cover crops (100-200 years before Columbus) 

North Americans were using cover crops before Europeans showed up. We don't know for sure how long before, but it was before. 
&gt;and survived on less productive cultures (maize is **still** more productive than wheat, there's no Indian magic in it; so is potato).  

There's no Indian magic? Do you know anything about what you're saying? Wild corn is garbage, it's the little stupid corn things you get in your Chinese food. The corn you actually eat was bred by native Americans to be worthwhile, and the really productive varieties need to be processed using chemicals and sophisticated methods that the ""primitive"" native Americans figured out before even the Mayans developed written language. Potatoes were straight up poison before native Americans fixed them. 

&gt;Europe didn't know domesticated plants? Hm, good to know... Oh, wait! Wheat, oats, barley, rye, turnip... Again, happens since Neolithic, doesn't need any knowledge Europe didn't have.  

Wild and/or ancestral wheats such as bulgar, spelt, farro and others are perfectly edible and are sold in the wheat aisle of your grocery store. They're slightly less productive than mainstream varieties, but they're more flavorful and tend to be more disease resistant. 

&gt;They had houses and boats, so they did it. But they were waaaay behind.  

Houses and boats were not particularly important to them. When they were, they did amazing things, but for the most part they didn't build permanent structures and they didn't need boats to go beyond a couple miles from shore. 

&gt;Recurring appearance of various forms of a germ theory since Ancient Greece, including books on the matter. Miazma theory dominated the landscape, but Europe at least **had** the root of the modern understanding of disease. No such thing for prehistoric NA.  
&gt;Mondino de Luzzi, Anatomia corporis humani, 1316.  

Did any European in north America know any of that shit? Did any doctor in most major cities? They were bounced between academics and philosophers, but were incredibly obscure.

&gt;Except the wide-spread folk medicine and monasteries copying ancient books on herbalism and keeping gardens to grow said herbs to use in medical treatments (that's why wounded medieval kings ended up there). Both survived to our days. 

Would you rather be treated by a 17th century medieval barber, or a 17th century native American herbalist? Because sure, herbalism was understood by some in Europe, but weren't practiced by many because those who practiced it were *often burned as witches*.  Medicine was kept down for centuries in Europe by classism and Christianity.

There is a lot more data about the real life efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine, the data on the J&amp;J vaccine primarily comes from their clinical trials and in vitro testing. The only data on efficacy vs the Delta variant is in vitro - exposing the blood of a vaccinated person to the virus in a petri dish and seeing if the blood exhibits immunity titers. 

Pfizer, on the other hand has been used in many countries where its efficacy can be tracked; there is a lot of data on Pfizer vs the Delta variant, relatively speaking. It's also likely, based on clinical trials, that Pfizer provides more protection (yes, it's true that the trials were not conducted at the same time or with exactly the same methods, but I think Pfizer has the stronger case for efficacy overall). 

Obviously, Pfizer requires two doses and J&amp;J only one. 

J&amp;J has a known issue with a very rare blood clotting problem in a very small number of women of child-bearing age. The reports were scary on this when they first happened, but the medical community now knows how to handle these issues. 

Pfizer (and Moderna) has a known, but rare association with myocarditis/percarditis (inflammation of the heart/tissues surrounding the heart), primarily in young men. There don't appear to be any serious outcomes with these problems. 

I do not believe there is good data showing that J&amp;J provides more immunity faster. In fact, the protection provided two weeks after the first dose of Pfizer appears to be as good (or better) than the efficacy four weeks after J&amp;J. 

For most people, the choice will come down to more proven efficacy (Pfizer) vs. convenience of one dose (J&amp;J). Either is a good choice.

Why? They've been consistently useless.

* From the start, the RIVM said the virus is unlikely to ever arrive in the Netherlands - letting Limburg and Brabant hold super spreader events for karnivaal
* Never stopping flights from countries with high infections
* Head of the RIVM basically telling everyone to not bother wearing masks because they aren't 100% effective
* The RIVM saying its unlikely the delta variant comes to the Netherlands (because this assumption went so well the first time)
* The government telling companies it is fine to commute into the office again
* The government letting NS advertise their services when they don't bother enforcing mask wearing and have overcrowded trains despite many people still not using their services
* The government saying masks aren't needed when Delta variant is on our doorstep
* The government absolutely screwing up the start of the vaccine program, putting us weeks, if not months behind
* The government telling young people to get screwed by opening everything up before allowing young people the opportunity to get vaccinated
* The government using cheap measure like an 8pm curfew and no alcohol being purchased after 8pm - affecting everyone's freedom for being too incompetent at enforcing rules that should mean the aforementioned aren't necessary at all.

Incorrect, i stated California had arguably the strictest covid restrictions but still struggled preventing the virus from spreading.  You then claimed Illinois had strict covid restrictions that were a success and I pointed out Illinois was in the bottom half in cases and deaths per capita.

My point was Californias restrictions did little to prevent the spread and neither did Illinois.

Yes, Rona will be part of our society for a long time, so what? The flue and common cold are here to stay, and Rona is here to stay!

We're currently developing new treatments and new vaccines. Is it going to be easy? Hell no! But spreading fears about new mutations is a dumb move. 
If you read the articles about delta variants in Israel, you'll see that hospitalization of fully vaccinated people is still extremely low. Basically, nobody dies if vaccinated. 
We have a very poor education about vaccines. Vaccines are not meant to stop the illness. It's intended to keep people out of hospitals...

Vox has a great breakdown of how the vaccine work and what we should expect from a vaccine.

1) regarding testing positive - Someone who is vaccinated still needs to mount an immune response to squash the virus and the pcr tests can pick up tiny amounts of virus fragments, far lower than what is needed to transmit the virus or cause any symptoms.  In fact the test won’t be able to tell if it is a viral fragment (meaning no live replicating virus) or live replicating virus.  

2) you just cannot compare the immune response in someone who is vaccinated to someone who is unvaccinated. Most of the long Covid symptoms appear to be from the immune system going wonky and mounting an autoimmune response.  This should not happen in someone who is vaccinated.  The immune response is already primed - there is no learning stage where immune misdirection into autoimmunity would happen.

3) The immune response is already primed and ready to go - there should not be a period where the virus is replicating like crazy and causing micro vascular damage increasing the chance of sudden death.

4) you can see evidence of a shifting immune response happening in the symptom changes for people who have vaccine breakthrough cases.

Respectfully, this isn’t true. We’ve had real world studies for a while. Neutralization tests are useful but definitely not the best or only thing we’ve had.

&gt; Totally, do you disagree with the links I provided in the section you quoted?

I wouldn’t say I “disagree” with them (although one of them is “VeryWellHealth” and not a scientific journal so I tend to not pay attention to them), but I just think it’s important to note that they’re not real world numbers, just Petri dish tests.

&gt; If you have a suggestion for how to reword that section

Personally I would say that the merit of the vaccines stands on it’s own, and doesn’t really need comparison to natural infection immunity, since I think most rational people would prefer vaccination over natural infection to begin with. But what I have a problem with, when it comes to that section, is that it strongly suggests that vaccination induces stronger immunity than natural infection, with the possibility left open that they are simply “similar”. In the face of real world results where sometimes zero reinfections are found, or 99% reduction of symptomatic disease is found, it seems misleading to state the information this way when the vaccines are certainly not 100% or 99% effective against symptomatic disease. Granted, these are *some* results and not *all* of them, so they are still open to interpretation, but if it were me, I would feel bad writing that sentence the way you did without noting the possibility that vaccine induced immunity may actually fall short of natural immunity, and studies attempting to find real-world benefits of vaccination after natural infection have often come up short.",,,1625939450,{},h4q29em,False,t3_ohdwot,False,True,t1_h4pxrhw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ohdwot/daily_discussion_thread_july_10_2021/h4q29em/,1626122525,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The former comes out of nowhere and nurses and aides are just supposed to suck it up and take it. Unlike basically every other job in existence.

Slash-and-burn agriculture and crop rotation were known to Europe for a long time. Europe had better understanding of fertilizing, used animal force for handling the land, used three-fields system that NA (to the best of my knowledge) never had, introduced cover crops (100-200 years before Columbus) and survived on less productive cultures (maize is **still** more productive than wheat, there's no Indian magic in it; so is potato).  


&gt;Good bet every single one of those dishes contains at least one crop successfully bred from a garbage wild ancestor by native Americans

Europe didn't know domesticated plants? Hm, good to know... Oh, wait! Wheat, oats, barley, rye, turnip... Again, happens since Neolithic, doesn't need any knowledge Europe didn't have.  


&gt;Seamanship? Architecture? They didn't really do that, so that doesn't count.

They had houses and boats, so they did it. But they were waaaay behind.  


&gt;Germ theory and modern anatomical research were completely derided in Europe until the 18th century.

Recurring appearance of various forms of a germ theory since Ancient Greece, including books on the matter. Miazma theory dominated the landscape, but Europe at least **had** the root of the modern understanding of disease. No such thing for prehistoric NA.  
Mondino de Luzzi, Anatomia corporis humani, 1316.  


&gt;Herbal medicine was generally viewed as a type of witchcraft.

Except the wide-spread folk medicine and monasteries copying ancient books on herbalism and keeping gardens to grow said herbs to use in medical treatments (that's why wounded medieval kings ended up there). Both survived to our days.

If we don't, it will become more seasonal like the flu (more likely), depending on how long antibodies last.

[],,Kryosleeper,,,[],,,,text,t2_4765ffpc,False,False,[],"&gt;crop rotation wasn't known in Europe so much as it was known that certain fields needed to be left fallow for a year or so while weed crops we're grown

Two- and three-fields systems are literally modes of a crop rotation. And not like Indians had any better knowledge of soil chemistry, so no reason to blame Europeans for ""just knowing to leave it alone"".  


&gt;They also had the ""three sisters"" method of planting where corn, beans and squash were grown side by side as permaculture, which kept the soil productive while still providing a complete diet.

For one, this method also doesn't work with any kind of mechanization (plowing with domesticated animals included), so it's a dead-end for a large-scale agriculture.  


&gt;They used animals that North America didn't have, and fertilized with their feces.

So? They domesticated and used them. America had llamas used for moving burdens for quite some time (since you insist on mentioning potato that has little to do with NA).  


&gt;They didn't need it.

So? They didn't, and the overall development of agriculture went the other way. Looks like having low population density and high yield cultures helps to not need stuff.  


&gt;North Americans were using cover crops before Europeans showed up. We don't know for sure how long before, but it was before.

Would be really nice to get a good source on it. For one, growing beans as cover crops after growing beans as a part of ""three sisters"" looks strange.  


&gt;Wild corn is garbage

So? Wild apples are small and sour. Wild olives are nowhere near the one you get in a shop nowadays. Wild wheat looses grains easily, and domestication included making it sturdier, so you do not end up with half of the harvest left in the field (people literally had to fight the way it plants itself).  


&gt;Potatoes were straight up poison before native Americans fixed them.

If I remember correctly, tubers of the wild potato are relatively edible and were even consumed raw (and for sure - when properly cooked), so it wasn't ""a deadly plant turned into a miraculous food"". A good reason why the tuber is the only part we consume nowadays.  


&gt;Wild and/or ancestral wheats such as bulgar, spelt, farro and others are perfectly edible and are sold in the wheat aisle of your grocery store. They're slightly less productive than mainstream varieties, but they're more flavorful and tend to be more disease resistant.

I don't think people ever domesticated something really poisonous just to eat it. Either it was already at least partially edible, or it was domesticated for other needs and then found to be good to eat it. After all, the green part of potato (the most poisonous one in the wild) is still not used much.  
And I hope you understand all of those listed are domesticated species (just less optimized), and bulgur is not even a grain - it's a dish made of wheat.  


&gt;Houses and boats were not particularly important to them. When they were, they did amazing things, but for the most part they didn't build permanent structures and they didn't need boats to go beyond a couple miles from shore.

Amazing for prehistoric people - maybe. But even by means of Ancient Egypt and Babilonia it's not really impressive. Again pretty normal for Neolithic people.  
It also says a lot about the level of your trade and travel when you do not use boats much while having access to huge waterways.  


&gt;Did any European in north America know any of that shit? Did any doctor in most major cities? They were bounced between academics and philosophers, but were incredibly obscure.

Luzzi's book was used for training doctors. So yes, chances were good. As for a germ theory, between ""someone knows and supports it"" and ""have no idea"" Europe is a clean winner.  


&gt;Would you rather be treated by a 17th century medieval barber, or a 17th century native American herbalist? Because sure, herbalism was understood by some in Europe, but weren't practiced by many because those who practiced it were often burned as witches. Medicine was kept down for centuries in Europe by classism and Christianity. It should've been better, but it wasn't.

Now this one is just some gibberish. Monks openly practicing herbalism for centuries were burned as witches? Folk medicine was punished so much it survived until modern times? Europe had medical universities for hundreds of years by the time of Columbus! By 17th century botany was an integral part of medical knowledge! And this knowledge was constantly expanding based on what European contacts worldwide brought up - for one, a treatment for malaria (an Old World disease) was found in Peru in said 17th century by a trained European apothecary. *The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp* is a 17th century picture (which, by the way, is done on a technical level impossible for any culture of NA at that time. Yet another thing Europe was a few millennia ahead).",,,1625893355,{},h4o70rv,False,t3_ogcqtf,False,False,t1_h4n87jf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ogcqtf/american_indians_have_the_highest_covid/h4o70rv/,1626083862,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

What would we do if it were decided that people have no right to refuse the vaccine? To enforce it we would have to arrest refusers and administer it by force.   That's completely outside what's acceptable. 

Buuuut... as I said, other people have a right to be protected from antivax cult members.

See, it doesn't matter whether the vaccine reduces transmission, that's not the issue as you still spread it regardless. What matters that it reduces severity and hospitalitisation which is the key to normality.

So, knowing everyone will still spread it, knowing everyone can still get ill; it makes no sense to use passports. Why?

1) bodily autonomy. If you don't want it you shouldn't be forced. You shouldn't have backdoor discrimination against the unvaccinated.

2) testing using flawed tests that the manufacturer themselves aren't using because they are so unreliable, is pointless. You've seen school kids using lemon juice to get a positive result and 10 days off school right? 

3) Say an unvaccinated person walks in. Spreads it. Those vaccinated will be less likely to be ill with it. The unvaccinated is more likely

4) Children under 12 won't be vaccinated. Even Witty has said they are of little risk and any side effects must outweigh the effects of Covid; but there's no effects of Covid. So herd immunity will never be achieved and it will always spread.

5) Witty when asked at the conference said that Uni students don't need 2 doses before September and the under 25s are low risk anyway.

At a press briefing, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said the number of new cases linked to clusters at wholesale markets in Taipei City had dropped considerably since the CECC set up a special command center in the area on July 2.

He was referring to the 200-plus cases recently confirmed at the First Fruit &amp; Vegetable Wholesale Market, the Second Fruit &amp; Vegetable Wholesale Market, and Huannan Market, which are located in the city's Wanhua and Zhongshan districts.

From July 1-3, the CECC and Taipei City government tested 11,159 people at the three markets, and 51 of them, or 0.44 percent, were positive, Chen said.

During further testing on July 8 and 9, only four new cases were found among the 4,671 people tested, which indicated a positivity rate of 0.08 percent, he said.

""Given this improvement in the situation, the CECC decided to close its special command center in the area on Saturday, but testing will continue at the markets next week,"" Chen said.


Meanwhile, the number of cases in a Delta variant cluster in Pingtung remained at 17 on Saturday, despite widespread testing, which indicated that it was under control, according to Chen.

Recent tests on 3,033 patients and staff at Fangliao General Hospital, where several of the infections are believed to have occurred, have all been negative, while over 500 of the 600 contacts identified in the cluster have been released from quarantine, Chen said.

Meanwhile, of the 33 new COVID-19 cases confirmed Saturday, 31 were domestic infections, all in northern Taiwan, and 19 had tested positive while in quarantine, according to the CECC.


Taipei and New Taipei cities each reported 13 cases, followed by Taoyuan with four cases and Keelung with one, the CECC said.

Of the domestic cases, 21 had a known source of infection, while two had unknown links to other cases, and eight were under investigation, the CECC said.

The two imported cases were Taiwan nationals, in their 20s and 30s, who returned from Italy and Belgium in late June and tested positive before the end of their quarantine period, the CECC said.

It said the six deaths reported Saturday were two men and four women, ranging in age from their 30s to their 80s, who passed away between July 6 and July 8.

The new cases bring the total number in Taiwan to 15,218, of which some 13,800 are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded over 100 cases in a single day.

The number of deaths in Taiwan from COVID-19 has now risen to 736, including 724 since May 15, CECC data shows.

“The researchers found elevations of C5b9 in pediatric  patients with severe COVID-19 and MIS-C, but to their surprise, they also found that C5b9 was elevated in patients with minimal or asymptomatic disease. Of the 22 patients for whom complete data were available, 19 (86%) met the criteria for TMA [thrombotic microangiopathy]. Additionally, sC5b9 levels were elevated both in patients who did and did not meet criteria for TMA. Although most children with COVID-19 do not have severe disease, our study shows that there may be other effects of SARS-CoV-2 that are worthy of investigation.”

“Methods: We retrospectively investigated patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 but who did not show any symptoms. Among the 139 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Yeungnam University Hopistal in Daegu, South Korea, 10 (7.2%) were asymptomatic. Their chest CT and radiographic findings were analyzed. Results: In the results, all patients (100%) had ground-glass opacity (GGO) on chest CT. Further, the GGO lesions were predominantly distributed peripherally and posteriorly in all patients. In 9 (90%) patients, the GGO lesions were combined with reticular opacity.”

This study (including a control group with n~5000) may be an interesting read. Mild-moderate acute stage. 15% reported moderate to severe symptoms &gt;8 months post infection.

Comparing seropositive vs seronegative participants, 26% vs 9% reported at least 1 moderate to severe symptom lasting for at least 2 months (RR, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.2-3.8]) and 15% vs 3% reported at least 1 moderate to severe symptom lasting for at least 8 months (RR, 4.4 [95% CI, 2.9-6.7]) (Table). The most common moderate to severe symptoms lasting for at least 2 months in the seropositive group were anosmia, fatigue, ageusia, and dyspnea.

That is not a hard-and-fast rule. It is often the case, but not always.

The virus has plenty of time to spread before killing the host. Also, in a majority of cases, it doesn’t kill the host. With those two factors in play, there is little to no selective pressure to favor less-lethal strains of the virus.

The other reason sometimes given for respiratory viruses to become less lethal as they become more contagious is about what part of the respiratory system they reproduce best in. Something that favors the lungs is expected to be more dangerous and less transmissible than something that favors the upper respiratory system. I have no idea how much evidence there is for this actually happening/shaping viral evolution in general, but even if it is a thing, it probably won’t apply here.

As an adult who has not caught the chicken pox, my doctor has stressed that what's a mild disease in children can be much worse for me. Even a non fatal case can have lasting effects, such as making me permanently sterile. A vaccine and low community spread, however, makes me much less at risk should I encounter an unvaccinated person who has not previously been infected.

I am not sure where you are getting the ""near 10,000 per day"" from. The highest 7-day average of cases in Florida reached \~18,000 in January ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/florida-covid-cases.html)), and then began to decrease.

&gt;The 7-day average never came up to 10,000 during Feb -through June.

Yes, and neither has July. The current 7-day average stands at 3,392, no where near a 7-day average of 10,000. There is no denial.

&gt;I'm talking about the newest rates that have spiked in alternate days. The 7 day average will have to wait another 6 to 13 days...

Okay, we'll have to see. There was a raise in cases and spike in April that went to 9,000 one day, but then the 7-day average decreased. 

Again, with the amount of people being vaccinated, and with the vaccines protecting against the Delta variant as well (as I cited in my previous reply).

It means for an individual, you are 95% or 90%, whichever you prefer, less likely to get a serious case of Covid then you would have without the vaccine.


[Covid-19 vaccine efficacy explained](https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-explained.html)

&gt;One common misunderstanding is that 95% efficacy means that in the Pfizer clinical trial, 5% of vaccinated people got COVID. But that's not true; the actual percentage of vaccinated people in the Pfizer (and Moderna) trials who got COVID-19 was about a hundred times less than that: 0.04%. 

&gt;What the 95% actually means is that vaccinated people had a 95% lower risk of getting COVID-19 compared with the control group participants, who weren't vaccinated. In other words, vaccinated people in the Pfizer clinical trial were 20 times less likely than the control group to get COVID-19. 

&gt;That makes the vaccine  ""one of the most effective vaccines that we have,"" Barker told Live Science. For comparison, the two-dose measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97% effective against measles and 88% effective against mumps, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The seasonal flu vaccine is between 40% and 60% effective (it varies from year to year, depending on that year's vaccine and flu strains), but it still prevented an estimated 7.5 million cases of the flu in the U.S. during the 2019-2020 flu season, according to the CDC.",,,1625934171,{},h4prh3q,False,t3_ohiazb,False,True,t1_h4pghp3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ohiazb/texas_man_vaccinated_contracts_delta_variant/h4prh3q/,1626116458,18,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

One thing we have learned is that it now takes about 2-3 months for a reasonably-contagious virus to spread globally from an initial hotspot.

When ships were how people got around, the transit time was usually long enough for the passengers to either die or beat back the disease before reaching their destination. Now vast numbers of people can (and do) travel anywhere in the world before they even know they are sick.  So the traditional barriers against global infection are mostly gone.

At the same time, we don't seem to have developed effective countermeasures for this, or a willingness to use them.  People want their vacations and trips no matter what.

As far as I understand it, the virus can absolutely still enter your system. It’s not like it somehow blocks your nose or mouth from virus entry. 

It’s still about telling your immune system how to respond. Breakthrough cases as I understand it is when the vaccine gets more of a foothold and generally shows on tests. But you still can be negative but have the virus in your system, even if at extremely low levels because the immune system has started fighting it. 

So for example, you go to Costco unmasked but are vaccinated. Someone who has COVID and is unvaccinated coughs basically right at you, and you inhale thousands of Covid particles/virus. The vaccine does nothing to stop that, Covid is in your system. By at least how I define infected, you are infected. Maybe the clinical definition is different and that’s where confusion can arise and if so I apologize. But my point is in at least that sense, you are infected. Then your immune system sees it and kills it, hopefully no breakthrough really at that point. 

Hopefully that makes my point I tried to make clearer.

rotation I mentioned. I don't understand what you are trying to prove   
here.

crop rotation wasn't known in Europe so much"" is a wrong statement.  


&gt;Plow field, plant bean corn bean squash, bean corn bean squash.

""Three sisters"" cultures were sowed at different times, not simultaneously.  


&gt;Small parts of the Andes had llamas. They were not widespread.

Yes, domestication takes time and effort. So?  


&gt;Potatoes were grown all around North America.

Domesticated in SA. And there's no sure information on it NA until it was grown by colonists. Only some wild varieties at the very south, Texas and Mexico. For one, it's not a part of ""three sisters"" of maize, beans and squash.  


&gt;Before the introduction of smallpox, several native American cities,   
ones the size of some European cities, thrived. Low pop density, on the   
order you're bringing up here, wasn't a feature of American life until   
Europeans (in this case unwittingly) fucked it up.

Doesn't look to be true. We know about one (Cahokia) that **maybe**, **for a brief amount of time**, **at its best**, **way before Europeans arrived**, was **slightly** larger than London that wasn't a particularly large city at that time in Europe. It declined pre-Columbus. And it was significantly smaller in population than Babylon, for example (not even mentioning Constantinople or Rome at their best). Babylon was also had way higher population density.  


&gt;Wait, wait, wait. Do you realize you just validated my entire argument?   
Native Americans had better crop yields is basically my entire   
agriculture argument right there.

Cultures naturally have different yield. You'd have troubles trying to make carrot as effective as rise even nowadays, or oak growing like wild bamboo. Beans have waaaay worse mass per area used than corn or wheat.  


&gt;Some, yeah. But Europeans weren't cross breeding apples for the most   
part. They were just eating the little sour ones because they're still   
food.

Flower Of Kent and Kosztela would like to object to this statement. So do depictions in arts.  


&gt;Wild potatoes are extremely bitter, small, and **must be processed with clay in order to eat them**.

So yes, wild potatoes were edible. Being bitter and small is not a lethal drawback. And, as you said, ""they're still food"".  


&gt;Let's go ahead and add tomatoes to the list of plants about which you're wrong then.

Solanum pimpinellifolium - an **edible wild tomato** that the modern one was cultivated from. So I'm actually 100% right.  


&gt;Look at Pueblo dwellings.

You consider it being more complex than Ishtar Gates, Roman architecture or York Minster? It's not even funny.  


&gt;Trade was conducted along waterways, bro. I'm not sure what your point is.

NA Indians largest boats didn't even have sails, save for some very rare and basic boats from the very south. Those are very basic vessels, typical for Neolithic cultures (for many of them there even 100% analogs in European Stone Age).

Read your own sources. ""*Accused witches were rarely herbalists\[...\]even smaller proportion came to trial as a direct result of their healing practices*"". It's literally the first paragraph of the document!

I don't need the numbers from the Chinese government. You have expats living in China reporting that the strict measures were lifted way before more countries. You have examples of China hosting international events without issue.

Also, comparing states within the US is being disingenuous when travel between states isn't barred.

&gt;Masks dont help against them.

We already have plenty of studies showing that masks do help reduce the number of infections. Go spread that narrative to someone selfish enough to believe it.

&gt;Social distance doesnt work against aërosols Unless you distance plus 8 meters.

Refer above. There's also a reason why social distancing is recommended along with wearing masks.

&gt;There have been papers about this for years.

Why don't you actually give a source with regards to COVID?

&gt;I am saying the measures dont work

Based on what exactly?

&gt;vaccines might work. We will see in fall when we are back in season again.

Imagine doubting the efficacy of vaccines when literally **all** available data from numerous countries shows that they are actually effective.

&gt;For now, where I live we are seeing worse numbers than last year summer, dispite vaccine. With stricter measures.

Where are you living in then?

&gt;But in the mean time my consititional right have been stript. I am bunlaw not allowed to hug my mom, Kids are on and off out of school.

Why don't you source these restrictions?

&gt;It's not because of people not abiding the rules

If your country is still facing high number of cases daily, it's exactly because people didn't abide by the rules.

&gt;But enjoy your anually booster shot

I won't enjoy it, but I'll certainly prefer it to developing any long COVID.

The scope of conversation is so tunnelled on vax vs no vax, there are not many discussions around the other things that people who are hesitant to get jabbed might be doing to reduce the chance of infection. For example there is interesting research into dandelion extract and certain CBD extracts modulating the ACE2 receptor; the gateway through which COVID infects us. Of course, no large scale pharma-conglomerates are interested in funding and fast-tracking these studies, unfortunately. So the vaccine becomes the only topic of conversation. 

Sadly these days I see to many echo chambers / polarized people either agreeing with one another or throwing insults at the other group. So people tend to stick to in circles with people who share a similar outlook. 

I’m finding that a common reason for vaccine hesitancy is peoples personal experiences being let down by the medical system and/or political interference. A good example is the suppression of cannabis as a medicine for decades - by the very same businesses and groups rolling out the vaccines. The manufacturers also have  a less than stellar track record when it comes to putting profits over health outcomes. So there’s often more to the picture than ridiculous and unfounded conspiracies, although they are certainly out there and taken as gospel by a worryingly large number of people who are not interesting in learning to evaluate sources properly.

I have a doctor friend who think it's not real besides hospitalized patients who may never recover - is that why? I do agree that a number of studies on this seem like BS but not all, same as how some symptoms could just be brought on by isolation and lockdowns and would happen in a control group too ... but not all. Also some ""long covid"" is just taking a bit more than 12 weeks to recover, which isn't the biggest deal if you're feeling better every week.

With all the above caveats, studies generally say 10-30% of people infected with covid (even mild or initially asymptomatic) can get it. When people say you're less likely to get long covid with a mild infection, that's because MOST hospitalized people will get long covid, not because it's rare among people with mild infections.

Also, the only study I could find **estimates the vaccine's protection at only 30% against long covid once you are infected**: [https://institute.global/policy/hidden-pandemic-long-covid,https://institute.global/policy/hidden-pandemic-long-covid](https://institute.global/policy/hidden-pandemic-long-covid,https://institute.global/policy/hidden-pandemic-long-covid), but I don't know how credible this study is.

It is likely that, in a significant proportion of the population, the vaccine will induce more effective and longer lasting immunity than that induced by natural infection. Hence it is recommended that everyone take the vaccine so that if your immunity after disease is absent or low, it can be boosted.

Covid has a fairly long presymptomatic period where you can be contagious, this means the selective pressure against a deadlier variant is basically removed. Covid could in theory mutate to be far more deadly, and as long as you can still spread it without symptoms, it would continue to spread. This is just basic evolution and natural selection.

What we didn't have back then but have now are highly effective vaccines.  The vaccines work and they work damn well and considering we have huge numbers of the most vulnerable populations vaccinated, there's no reason to think that we'll wind up anywhere near what we saw last year.  For those grown ass adults who make the choice to not vaccinate, that's on them.  In the US, the vaccine is widely available, you can walk into a Costco, a Walgreens, a Safeway, a Kroger, a CVS and even without an appointment you can walk out vaccinated, at no cost to yourself.  

Infections will happen, this year, next year, five years from now, fifty years from now, a hundred years from now.  This virus is forever.  There's no running or hiding from it or locking down your way out of it.  In time, most everyone will either be infected or be vaccinated.

&gt;
&gt;Two- and three-fields systems are literally modes of a crop rotation. And not like Indians had any better knowledge of soil chemistry, so no reason to blame Europeans for ""just knowing to leave it alone"".  
&gt;
The two and three fields system describes exactly the fallow field rotation I mentioned. I don't understand what you are trying to prove here.
&gt;&gt;They also had the ""three sisters"" method of planting where corn, beans and squash were grown side by side as permaculture, which kept the soil productive while still providing a complete diet.

&gt;For one, this method also doesn't work with any kind of mechanization (plowing with domesticated animals included), so it's a dead-end for a large-scale agriculture.  


Plow field, plant bean corn bean squash, bean corn bean squash. It works just fine with mechanized planting, just not mechanized harvesting. 
&gt;&gt;They used animals that North America didn't have, and fertilized with their feces.

&gt;So? They domesticated and used them. America had llamas used for moving burdens for quite some time 

Small parts of the Andes had llamas. They were not widespread. They're not particularly great as food animals, and as beasts of burden, dogs are significantly more compliant.
&gt;(since you insist on mentioning potato that has little to do with NA).  

Potatoes were grown all around North America.
&gt;&gt;They didn't need it.
&gt;
&gt;So? They didn't, and the overall development of agriculture went the other way. Looks like having low population density


Before the introduction of smallpox, several native American cities, ones the size of some European cities, thrived. Low pop density, on the order you're bringing up here, wasn't a feature of American life until Europeans (in this case unwittingly) fucked it up. 
&gt; and high yield cultures helps to not need stuff.  


Wait, wait, wait. Do you realize you just validated my entire argument? Native Americans had better crop yields is basically my entire agriculture argument right there. 
&gt;&gt;North Americans were using cover crops before Europeans showed up. We don't know for sure how long before, but it was before.
&gt;
&gt;Would be really nice to get a good source on it. For one, growing beans as cover crops after growing beans as a part of ""three sisters"" looks strange.  


I'm having a hard time finding a primary or scholarly source on this one. 

In certain climates, some varieties of beans grow in the fall and winter while corn does not, and when growing potatoes the soil is left depleted at the end of a season, so there are two good reasons to rotate beans into a native American garden. 

&gt;So? Wild apples are small and sour. 


Some, yeah. But Europeans weren't cross breeding apples for the most part. They were just eating the little sour ones because they're still food. 
&gt;Wild olives are nowhere near the one you get in a shop nowadays. 


They're smaller, yeah. The differences between the wild (and the domesticated) olives and what you get in the store is a matter of processing the olive with chemicals. 
&gt;Wild wheat looses grains easily, and domestication included making it sturdier, so you do not end up with half of the harvest left in the field (people literally had to fight the way it plants itself).  


That's really the only difference, though, and the easiest trait to accidentally breed out. 
&gt;&gt;Potatoes were straight up poison before native Americans fixed them.

&gt;If I remember correctly, tubers of the wild potato are relatively edible and were even consumed raw (and for sure - when properly cooked), so it wasn't ""a deadly plant turned into a miraculous food"". A good reason why the tuber is the only part we consume nowadays.  


https://www.alcademics.com/2014/09/the-potato-explained.html

You do not remember correctly. Wild potatoes are extremely bitter, small, and must be processed with clay in order to eat them. 

&gt;I don't think people ever domesticated something really poisonous just to eat it.


https://www.hobbyfarms.com/beware-poisonous-wild-cousins-tomatoes-carrots/

Let's go ahead and add tomatoes to the list of plants about which you're wrong then. 
&gt; Either it was already at least partially edible, or it was domesticated for other needs and then found to be good to eat it. After all, the green part of potato (the most poisonous one in the wild) is still not used much.  
&gt;And I hope you understand all of those listed are domesticated species (just less optimized), and bulgur is not even a grain - it's a dish made of wheat.  


Okay. 
&gt;&gt;Houses and boats were not particularly important to them. When they were, they did amazing things, but for the most part they didn't build permanent structures and they didn't need boats to go beyond a couple miles from shore.
&gt;
&gt;Amazing for prehistoric people - maybe. But even by means of Ancient Egypt and Babilonia it's not really impressive. Again pretty normal for Neolithic people.  


Look at Pueblo dwellings. 
&gt;It also says a lot about the level of your trade and travel when you do not use boats much while having access to huge waterways.  

Trade was conducted along waterways, bro. I'm not sure what your point is. 
&gt;&gt;Did any European in north America know any of that shit? Did any doctor in most major cities? They were bounced between academics and philosophers, but were incredibly obscure.
&gt;
&gt;Luzzi's book was used for training doctors. So yes, chances were good. As for a germ theory, between ""someone knows and supports it"" and ""have no idea"" Europe is a clean winner.  


Very, very few. You have admitted so much yourself. 

&gt;Now this one is just some gibberish. Monks openly practicing herbalism for centuries were burned as witches?

Monks, no, but the few monks that did practice some herbalism weren't accessible by most of society. 
&gt; Folk medicine was punished so much it survived until modern times? Europe had medical universities for hundreds of years by the time of Columbus!

That's where the barbers were trained to drain people's blood to balance their humors.
&gt; By 17th century botany was an integral part of medical knowledge! 


Well after contact with native Americans and well before humor theory fell from favor.
&gt;And this knowledge was constantly expanding based on what European contacts worldwide brought up - for one, a treatment for malaria (an Old World disease) was found in Peru in said 17th century by a trained European apothecary. *The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp* is a 17th century picture (which, by the way, is done on a technical level impossible for any culture of NA at that time. Yet another thing Europe was a few millennia ahead).

Countries that dealt with their pandemics quicker also had their economies recover earlier. China's the best example in which it was the only major economy to grow in 2020.

With a virus that spreads asymptomatically in large portion of people and pre-symptomatically in the rest of them then there is no selective pressure for the virus to mutate to become milder because it is already spreading efficiently.

&gt; 
&gt; 

It's only vaguely true in reference to viruses with an extremely high mortality rate that kill quickly. It sounds like someone picked up a bit of knowledge, but didn't realize it was only true in one set of circumstances.

A virus has no will of its own. It just reproduces and makes mistakes in doing that. Some of those mistakes make it deadlier. Some of those mistakes make it spread faster or slower. Some of those mistakes make the onset of disease come on sooner or faster.

From an evolutionary standpoint, the variants that survive will simply be the ones that are capable of continued reproduction. The ones that become dominant will be the ones that are better at reproducing and staying in the population.

What this individual is referring to is the paradox that a virus needs its host to live long enough to survive to pass it on or else it's an evolutionary dead end. A virus such as Ebola is so deadly and progresses so quickly in killing its host that it can't spread effectively. Ebola burns through areas because it kills too quickly.

So yes, if Ebola were to actually break out onto the world scene, it would probably be because it evolved to be less deadly. That would make it more effective at reproducing and spreading.

But that's not true of most viruses. Most viruses aren't so deadly that they kill their hosts before spreading. There's a wide middle range for a virus where they can be quite deadly, as coronavirus is, without damaging their own ability to reproduce.

There's also a ton of other factors that affect the spread of a virus. Before the invention of successful treatment, HIV had a near 100% mortality rate. However, it stayed dormant for years before symptoms started to appear. It had plenty of time to spread to other hosts, and it didn't mutate to become less deadly. It didn't need to. A version of Ebola that had a 30-day window before the onset of disease symptoms could spread much farther without being one whit less deadly.

Another factor is how the virus is transmitted. Ebola, thankfully, is transmitted only through bodily fluids. This vastly limits transmission. An airborne variant of Ebola would spread much faster. However, it could still probably be contained very easily due to how easy symptoms are to spot.

Covid is airborne and asymptomatic in large portions of the population. There's no evolutionary pressure for it to become less deadly, and it could probably become a great deal more deadly without remotely hindering its own ability to reproduce. So the person you're responding to is simply wrong.",,,1625933734,{},h4pqibd,False,t3_ohhdxn,False,True,t1_h4pccgc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ohhdxn/delta_spreads_225_faster_than_original_virus_this/h4pqibd/,1626115859,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

So it all exploded here, youth partying everywhere with a single dose Janssen (basically 0% testing) or a leaky test system, while the rest of the population overall got basically all of their freedoms back, while delta became the majority, lead to a mix creating this spike.

On the other hand, levels of deaths and hospitalisations are still at an extremely low level, and it is believed it will not increase in the same way as cases did, as the explosion of cases is almost exclusively caused by the youth, which is mostly partially vaccinated now or not at all. While the more vulnerable people and older people are not seeing a huge rise in cases and have almost all been fully vaccinated.

A mutation forms simply by errors in an RNA trascriptase (protein builder) turning the rna of covid into new viruses.  It doesn't have proofreading as good as humans have (which still isn't perfect). 

The more replication occurs, the more errors can form.  Most errors are useless or harmless, but some provide a benefit.  Huge spikes that we see in third world countries, much of which in people that can't even access a covid test so true numbers are much higher than we know, are where the mutation first arises simply due to proofreading errors.

That is my point. He should not. No vaccine is 100% efficient particularly with delta, even after two doses, and gyms are a place of particular emission of infectious particles. OP needs to do their own risk analysis. 

Israeli data, which might have methodological issues puts protection after two doses of Pfizer at 66%. That is far away from 100%. Other data from Canada and UK puts it at best at 88-92%. That is not 100%. Plus you do not know OP´s age, weight, race and other favors.

&gt;Most rational people I know feel safe doing pretty much everything they did pre-pandmeic.

If they are in New Zealand that makes sense. If they are anywhere else, maybe they are being misled into a false sense of security and it is worth reanalyzing that regarding vaccination data in their area, infection rates, what kind of variants are in their area and and their particular health.

Is everybody double vaccinated 100% safe against the delta variant in areas with an outbreak of it? No. Not, a 100% for sure.

Yes, on paper that’s what SHOULD happen. But when the rubber meets the road, as you know, things don’t always work out the way they do on paper.
