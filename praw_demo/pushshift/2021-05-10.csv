It's safer when there is less spread.  Heck, everybody is 100% protected if it is not spreading at all in your area.

&gt;Yes, of course, vaccinated people, in extremely rare circumstances, can still get infected. But serious complications from this already extremely remote possibility are infinitesimally small.

With a 95% efficacy, in a situation where 20 unvaccinated people would catch symptomatic COVID, if they are vaccinate then instead 1 vaccinated person would.

For some of the variants, the vaccinations still work well but are less effective. For example, the California variant has about 75% efficacy against the mRNA vaccines.  That means that in a situation where 4 unvaccinated people would get symptomatic COVID, only 1 would if they are all vaccinated.

But if you go into situations where you would be more than 20X (4X for variants) likely to catch COVID, then you could actually be MORE likely to catch it than if you were unvaccinated and more careful.  Like, going to a bar while vaccinated is probably more dangerous than NOT going to the bar without vaccination.

BUT, and this is the key point -  community spread of the virus is dropping because of the vaccines.  Pretty soon you will be protected by the mere fact that you will be very unlikely to come into contact with the virus no matter what you do.

Taiwan has generally kept the pandemic under control due to early prevention with only sporadic domestic cases, but since last month it has been dealing with an outbreak linked to China Airlines pilots and an airport hotel where many of them stayed. There have been 35 confirmed infections so far in the outbreak.

Health Minister Chen Shih-chung told reporters the only way to break the chain of transmission at the carrier is to quarantine all China Airlines¬†(2610.TW)¬†pilots currently in Taiwan and any who return.

""This will have a big impact on China Airlines, on its passenger and freighter flights, and for the crew, too. But for the safety of the whole community we cannot but make this decision,"" he said.

The pilots will only be allowed out of quarantine once they have tested negative, Chen said.

China Airlines, a major cargo carrier, said it would split the quarantining pilots into groups and try ""as much as possible to maintain flight operations; it is not a total grounding.""

China Airlines will prioritise cargo flights, but there will be disruption even as they ""go all out"" to ensure they can still fly, it said.

""The short-term reduction in Taiwan's import and export capacity will affect the delivery time of goods,"" China Airlines said, without elaborating.

Taiwan's health authorities believe some of the pilots got infected overseas, then spread the infection upon returning to Taiwan, and that others could have been infected by pilots from other airlines staying at the same hotel.",,,1620691381,{},gxo70xq,True,t3_n9js0s,False,True,t3_n9js0s,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n9js0s/taiwan_to_quarantine_pilots_of_its_largest/gxo70xq/,1620727699,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

My childlike idea of mRna vaccines is that they consist of blueprints for proteins wrapped in balls of fat. They get into the body, the fat dissolves and the body sees the blueprints and makes the protein. In the case of Pfizer, Moderna, Curevac et al, the blueprint is for the coronavirus spike protein. So the body makes this protein, which acts as the antigen for the immune system. Which get's your B Cells cloning antibodies, and your T Cells doing their thing. 

So just about everyone looking at mRna vaccines is asking the question ""what if we loaded each shot of the vaccine with blueprints for multiple proteins."" So for example you could give flu and covid boosters in one shot, combine vaccines for mutiple covid strains etc - as these have done. So the key work here is ""multimeric"".

Similar research is being done at Imperial College. They've combined their Ebola, Marburg and Lassa  RNA vaccines and tested it on mice. Their vaccine is cool stuff actually, it's ""self amplifying rna"". So not only does it kid your body into making the spike proteins, at also kids it into duplicating the blueprints. So you need a lot less raw material. Their covid vaccine was due to go into phase 3 trials at the start of this year, but they figured they'd missed the boat, and went back to the drawing board to incorporate temperature stability and needleless application.

Vaccines of this nature don't really have long term side effects. Unlike other vaccines, there isn‚Äôt any Covid (killed/attenuated) in this vaccine. All you have is mRNA, which are instructions to make a protein. In this case, this is the spike protein. Normally mRNA is made in the nucleus and goes out to the ribosomes where proteins are made, and then the mRNA is degraded. Here we are just bringing the mRNA to the ribosome from outside. mRNA doesn‚Äôt have the capability of entering the nucleus and making changes to the DNA, where there would be potential to do damage.

mRNA is super unstable and degrades really quickly (in a matter of hours). That‚Äôs why the Pfizer vaccine has to be held at such a low temperature, because otherwise the mRNA would degrade and be ineffective. That short time window + the lack of its ability to enter the nucleus really rules out any risk of significant side effects outside of allergic reactions.",,,1620743391,{},gxqe3xi,False,t3_n9g9y6,False,False,t1_gxq8otp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n9g9y6/fda_permits_use_of_the_pfizerbiontech_covid/gxqe3xi/,1620774574,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,RytheGuy97,,,[],,,,text,t2_mcg56,False,False,[],"I think people (in the west at least) should really temper their expectations of how many people around them are going to be masking up post-covid. 

I see people bring up East Asia a lot in these discussions and wonder if mask-wearing in western countries will be as prevalent as it is over there. But there‚Äôs a really important difference between east Asia and the west in that the former tends to be more collectivistic as a culture and the latter tends to be more individualistic. Research in cultural psychology shows us that people in collectivistic cultures tend to have more of what‚Äôs called an ‚Äúinterdependent self-construal‚Äù, which is to say that they tend to see themselves more as a member of a larger social group and less of an individual person. People in individualistic cultures have more of an independent self-construal, meaning that they see themselves more as individuals rather than a member of a social group. 

What this means in the context of mask-wearing is that people in East Asian countries are more likely to be okay with wearing masks to prevent the spread of diseases like the flu or the cold than people in the west. This is just my way of saying that I don‚Äôt expect seasonal mask-wearing to be prevalent at all in the west after the pandemic, we might see a few people here and there wearing masks because these self-construal differences are by no means dichotomous but besides that I just don‚Äôt see how an individualistic culture would ever be as okay with masks as a collectivistic culture. 

I think we saw this with SARS. I know that SARS wasn‚Äôt the origin of mask-wearing in east Asia but it definitely made it more prevalent, but Canada was actually one of the worst-hit countries and before covid I hadn‚Äôt seen anybody in my city west a mask except for a few Asian people. If Canadians were okay with mask-wearing being normalized out of the context of a disease scare we would have already seen it, and I don‚Äôt expect other western countries would differ much in that regard.

i.e. go to the ocean only in August despite the weather. Not talk on your phone in the train, even if there are 30 drunk people speaking at the top of their lungs... etc.

Vaccines rules: only doctors can give them!? Rationally, one would say we need to change that rule and make sure they can be given at many locations. Even if it means training previously unqualified people. Culturally: it is a rule so we should follow it.

Elderly and pre-existing people should come first: What if they do not use email, or cannot be contacted? Well obviously to maintain order, we need people to schedule appointments with them by going to their house. They may not be home, they may not answer the door, so people need to go back again. Very time costly way of doing things. But it is fair and protects the rules.

When compared to more rule-flexible nations like the US, 'it only matters in context', 'rules are for dummies', 'it ain't illegal unless you get caught' mentalities, you get massively slower rollouts.

Japan: Deny service. The rules say we can only have x beds for z patients with y staff.

Seven more domestic cases were reported on Tuesday, with the source of six of them unknown, leading to the tighter measures.

The CECC asked organizers to halt large-scale indoor and outdoor events ‚Äî those with more than 100 and 500 people, respectively ‚Äî until June 8.
Business venues are also being asked to start monitoring customer flows to maintain social distancing and avoid crowding.

A ban on eating and drinking on trains will also be imposed until June 8 to reduce the potential transmission of COVID-19, including trains run by the Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) and Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp., as well as highway buses, ferries, and domestic flights.

The high speed rail will only offer reserved tickets and suspend the sale of non-reserved tickets, which allow travelers to stand if there are no seats available or to sit in unoccupied seats in non-reserved carriages.

The TRA will also suspend the sale of standing-only tickets. The suspensions of THRSC and TRA non-reserved tickets will begin on May 15.
Meanwhile, over the next four weeks, visits to hospitalized patients and long-term care facilities around Taiwan will not be allowed, with few exceptions.

One full-time caregiver per hospital patient will still be allowed, the CECC said.

The latest measures come after a group of infections arose involving the Novotel airport hotel in Taoyuan and one of Taiwan's main airlines, leading to 35 infections, with 21 of them confirmed at present to be domestically transmitted.

On Tuesday, another seven domestic cases were reported, with one of them traced to the Novotel/China Airlines group, and the other six from unknown sources.

[],,socialistrob,,,[],,,,text,t2_14ssjz,False,False,[],"&gt; A serious question - there seems quite a correlation between Republican voting states and low vaccine demand. As a non American - is this a result of politicization of the pandemic?

Maybe and maybe not. We have a lot of correlations but I think labeling anything as a direct cause is going to be very challenging and I am not aware of any studies that have tried to control for other factors.

In 2020 the US had one of the strongest political divides between college educated voters and non college educated voters since polling began with the college educated voters much more likely to vote Democratic and non college educated voters much more likely to vote Republican. (I want to be clear that I'm NOT saying college education is a proxy for any other factor like intelligence or income or literally anything else). Both vaccine rates and voting habits are correlated with education. That doesn't mean that education caused these but I also wouldn't go so far as to assume that politicization of Covid caused them either. Correlation does not equal causation and I think there is a good chance that some of the factors that motivated a person to vote one way or another may have also motivated them to get the vaccine or not. The correlations are likely too strong to be purely coincidental but I would be very hesitant to assume they are causal either without further proof.",,,1620763929,{},gxrrpw8,False,t3_n9trat,False,True,t1_gxq4qcn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n9trat/these_are_the_states_with_the_highest_and_lowest/gxrrpw8/,1620801558,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

All the patients studied recovered fully.

That said, I had 2 shots of Pfizer back in February, with no reaction, despite my history of multiple anaphylactic food allergies. 

Of course, a single anecdote is not science or fact, so if you are concerned about allergies, look at the articles and data linked above, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/specific-groups/allergies.html)'s recommendations for people with allergies, and talk to your doctor about how to safely get the vaccine.

We are currently at just about 50% of adults a day, and should be averaging just about 1% a day, and we're not really showing any slow downs related to demand, we are still all very hungry for first doses. 

This is an interesting psychological problem, as I imagine we won't have trouble eclipsing the US average for total coverage with at least one dose, we pass a few states a day against that metric and have now passed.... 15ish states? We'll pass states like Texas and Florida within the next few days.

I don't imagine we'll slow because of demand for a few more weeks, by then we'll be at 70% of adults with at least one dose - at current pace should be around the 25th of the month. We have supply for more, but we're moving up more second doses now as well.

All this to say, I think we'll end up with wider coverage than the US, however I wonder if we'll have a lower eventual 'two dose' number, as every indication shows that with just a single dose we have enough efficacy to curtail the virus, and the appetite to get the second dose will probably fade as we have fewer and fewer deaths and cases. 

In the states, it looks like that same effect (fewer cases) might be contributing to apathy at getting vaccinated, however because they have not 'raced' to get as wide a coverage as us, and instead focused on two doses, I suspect it will end up looking different at the 'final tally'.

I absolutely commend Australia and NZ for their low death counts and ability to maintain some domestic normality in the initial phase, but it is going to be very tricky for them to now navigate this next phase. I know from experience that anti-vax sentiment in NZ at least is quite high, often with people who lean left being quite susceptible there for some reason.

On top of that, everyone I know there has an extremely sheltered perspective on the dangers of the pandemic now that they really haven't lived through it in the same way. I have young friends who seem really extreme in their personal risk assessment of the danger of covid considering their age, because compared to a place like the UK where everyone knows someone who has had it, very few people in NZ have done.

This is part of why there has been such success - the population being sufficiently alarmed resulted in more compliance with lockdown policy from what I can tell. 

That is going to be hard to undo even once the population is vaccinated. Any time I try raise the conversation of ""what next?"" with friends and family based there they react defensively and take it personally with a reluctance to answer that question, and from what I can tell in the media that's true in the public discourse too. 

The political sell of reopening and accepting some level of inevitable death and infection is going to be something I'm not convinced the popular current Labour government has the stomach for.",,,1620718889,{},gxped6o,False,t3_n8q5l4,False,False,t1_gxoyism,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n8q5l4/as_west_races_back_to_travel_zerocovid_economies/gxped6o/,1620752974,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

\&gt;  R0 is a useful number but it doesn‚Äôt tell you everything about infectivity,  

Sure, but it does tell us something. It tells us that SARS-COV2 is not an extremely infectious virus that might cause us to doubt whether an effective inoculation program could work. It tells us that of all the pathogens we have managed to contain with vaccines and education (but no social engineering measures) SARS-COV2 should be no more difficult.

\&gt;  We have said ‚Äúthese measures keep classrooms safe‚Äù based on data that didn‚Äôt happen to include a superspreader...

You can see in the paper that 2% of infected people are potential super spreaders at any given point in time. It is far more likely that for large defined cohorts like school classrooms (where many millions of individuals go) that the incidence of potential super spreaders will be constant. Two percent is simply too large to have been somehow not present in the recent past. To argue otherwise would be to suggest that something radical has changed in the nature of the infections, which there is no evidence of.

What is just as likely (as far as I am aware) is that the infection goes through a viral load spike which lasts about 2% of the time of the infection. That is, everyone who gets infected goes through a short period of being very very contagious. In this scenario improving effectiveness by adjustments to the vaccine strategy would be more difficult.

I do agree that identification of super spreaders (if they are individuals rather than time of infection) could allow for a better targeted vaccine strategy and could even be a game changer. But while a vaccine strategy can obviously be improved through targeting it is more difficult to imagine a vaccine strategy somehow becoming less effective because of the presence of super spreaders that were always there. We would have to postulate *more* super spreaders i.e. a change in the nature of the SARS-COV2 infection.

[],,hammy3000,,,[],,,,text,t2_62lxg,False,False,[],"Oh I didn't see you edited your earlier comment with sources. I'm not asking you to ""prove"" anything, again, I'm merely asking you to defend a viewpoint.  

Again, you're mischaracterizing my position, I'm not saying I have the infallible opinion, I'm merely asking why are you so confident in these results?  

I've seen both of those sources before and I'm happy to discuss them. First of all, you may want to be careful on which sources you're using to prove your point, because your first source, explicitly *is not talking about medical or cloth masks,* aka 99% of the actual masks everyone is using.  

In fact, it explicitly mentions in the results (towards the end of the paragraph if you want to verify it yourself): ""Medical masks were not effective, and cloth masks even less effective.""   

Again, this is my whole concern, all of this masking we are doing seems really pointless and unfounded in the data.   

Your second source is from MMWR which is not a peer-reviewed journal, it's a digest. **That's okay,** *I can't stress enough how okay that is, I'm not trying to call you a liar/otherwise* but just something to be aware of if you're asking for only peer reviewed sources, you are not providing only peer reviewed sources yourself. This is a four page summary on some data points. My problem with this source is three fold: 

Firstly, it's only specifically talking about a 0.7%-1.9% reduction in cases. They are saying this is within the margin of error, but man that's a tight margin of error. Not impossible to deduce real data from that, but I find it hard to see explicit causation there. 

Secondly, it doesn't review counties where there *weren't* mask mandates. Which kind of seems like the whole point. How do you know variables are working without understanding the control?    

But, for the sake of argument, let's assume it's all true, masks do really help about 1%. 0.7% to 1.9% slowed rates are a far cry from the touted ""70% effectiveness"" you see people throw around all the time as political pundits and the general media. It makes the discussion much more nuanced and harder to answer.  

Thirdly, in the article itself, it makes note that while cases saw a general decrease, there was *no statistical evidence* that deaths saw any particular uptick or decrease due to masks.   

From page 351 of the MMWR you cited:  
&gt;Daily death growth rates before restrictions were lifted were not
statistically different from those during the reference period,
whereas significant differences in daily case growth rates were
observed 41‚Äì60 days before restrictions were lifted.  

Now, I leave it to the reviewer to determine if 0.7-2.0% differences are significant or not, but to me, it casts even more doubt on the efficacy of masking.   

In terms of the *effectivness* of cloth and medical masks, this has been generally known for a very long time. It's why every box of medical masks, even now, still says it ""does not protect against viruses or infectious disease."" The general viewpoint on this did not start changing culturally until last year. I'd love to share some charts and data with you to see what you think, but you specifically asked for peer-reviewed sources, so here's a few to check out, happy to discuss any of this further with you.   

[Open Access Medical Journal - A cluster randomised trial of cloth masks compared with medical masks in healthcare workers](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/5/4/e006577.full.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3knj_s9Nr6xSjjiaqLocDsD-plJKnufncQ2QUzvP8-K0YqU6UhtttbenYhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/?fbclid=IwAR1lVVfr4DbSZSydl5PZJA-mNjLM1sHVQqRrmxFGX14XsctxY-cUqRgeJdQ)

Since you did one peer reviewed and one non, I did the same just to keep everything in check and to further clarify, I don't think peer-review is the end-all-be-all of evidence.

The Pfizer trial had no deaths in the placebo control group either.  Again, zero in the control groups... and then people said that the vaccine was 100% effective against deaths.  Does that mean that the placebo is as well?

&gt;The two vaccine trials that did explicitly report hospitalizations as an efficacy outcome make this latter issue very clear. For the [AstraZeneca](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf) vaccine, one person in the control group had severe COVID-19, but eight people were hospitalized; for [Johnson &amp; Johnson](https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download), 34 people in the placebo group had severe COVID-19, but only five people were hospitalized. It‚Äôs true that zero vaccinated people were hospitalized in either study after the vaccines took effect. **But with numbers that small, you can‚Äôt draw a reliable conclusion about how high efficacy may be for these outcomes. As Diana Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research** [**pointed out**](https://www.center4research.org/testimony-of-dr-diana-zuckerman-of-nchr-before-the-fda-advisory-committee-on-j-j-covid-vaccine/) **about the Johnson &amp; Johnson trial, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs misleading to tell the public that nobody who was vaccinated was hospitalized unless you also tell them that only 5 people in the placebo group were hospitalized.‚Äù** She‚Äôs right. And you can‚Äôt be confident about predicting effectiveness precisely in a wider population outside the trial, either. For example, some of the vaccine trials included relatively few people older than 60 as participants.

&gt;You can see how fragile these numbers are by looking at those compiled for severe disease. **In the** [**Pfizer trial**](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download)**, for example, just one vaccinated person developed severe COVID-19 versus three in the placebo group‚Äîwhich meant that a single bout of disease made the difference between a calculated efficacy rate of 66 percent and one of 100 percent.** For the [Novavax](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3) and [Oxford-AstraZeneca](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf) trials, there were zero people with severe disease in the vaccinated group versus only one in the control group, so adding or subtracting one would have been even more dramatic. **The problem is even greater for deaths. For that efficacy analysis, only two of the vaccine trials‚Äîfor Moderna‚Äôs and Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs‚Äîreported any COVID-19 deaths at all in the control groups.**",,,1620686331,{},gxnwv8v,False,t3_n979ab,False,True,t1_gxn3787,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n979ab/covid19_vaccines_further_evidence_of_success/gxnwv8v/,1620722416,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

so, since you made me really dig deep and explain my half-assed comment that I wrote while taking a poop this morning, yes. the distance from India to japan while an interesting talking point isn't the real point. the real point of this is there are 400k cases a day in India, India is somewhere on the god damn planet with the fucking Olympics in Japan and they have multiple variants raising hell in India. 

Perhaps, for the people who can't seem to let go of their protractors, i should have said ""the virus touched the whole world and I'm sure it will have no problem being transmitted by some means from India to Japan, the way it was transmitted from China to  New York City.""

Canada is currently administering more doses per capita than the US is on a daily basis... regardless of them being further behind in total vaccinations. That's the metric, and you're losing. 

The US is doing the best when you set the parameters of the argument to make them the best. On a per capita basis (which levels out countries of different sizes in order to make fair comparisons) it's not the best at anything.

Yep.  And there's still huge pockets of the U.S. population who aren't coming in to receive those vaccines (either the 1st or 2nd dose), which is the main reason why they haven't started exporting yet.  

They're still trying to figure out how to juggle conserving existing supply of vaccine, how much more they need to keep making, how to get it to the right pharmacies/vaccine centers - and are struggling with that.  

Adding in the logistical steps of exporting existing vaccines to multiple other countries while actively still trying to administer vaccines to hundreds of millions, would be something of a nightmare.

And yet they're doing and planning exactly that - with AstraZeneca vaccines, for the moment, but hopefully with other vaccines soon.

&gt; Uhh - the EU is asking them to allow exports, not donate for free. 

Which corresponds to going above and beyond / focus on helping other countries.  Sure, they'd get paid for their service but it takes an effort of good will to get that started in the first place / not focus exclusively on themselves.

And they should do it.  I agree.  I'd love for nothing more than for the U.S. to do the right thing and to start exporting some Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, or at least some of the J&amp;J considering how many Americans are hesitant to take it after 5-6 people had serious side effects (out of millions).

&gt; Anvisa recommended on Monday (10/5) the immediate suspension of the use of the Covid vaccine from AstraZeneca / Fiocruz in pregnant women. The guidance is in the Technical Note issued by the Agency.

&gt; Anvisa's guidance is that the indication for the AstraZeneca vaccine package insert be followed by the National Immunization Program (PNI). The guidance is the result of constantly monitoring adverse events on Covid vaccines in use in the country.

&gt; The ""off label"" use of vaccines, that is, in situations not provided for in the package insert, should only be done through individual assessment by a health professional who considers the risks and benefits of the vaccine for the patient. The current package insert for the AstraZeneca vaccine against Covid does not recommend the use of the vaccine without medical advice. 


The federal government recommended vaccinating pregnant women two weeks ago.

Lockdowns and other restrictive public health measures infringe on fundamental rights and freedoms. Therefore, they need to be justified. The fact that more people than die outright of COVID suffer long term effects, and likely will also have decreased life expectancy and/or prolonged psychological burden, is further justification for suppressing the spread of COVID, in addition to the infection fatality rate.

I am actually of the opinion that it‚Äôs uncomfortably ambiguous whether the extreme lengths governments have gone to suppress the spread of covid are justifiable. Net life expectancy would have decreased by somewhere between 0.3 and 1 years per person, one average, if we had just let COVID run through the population.

You can ask yourself, personally, if you would have given up a year of your life expectancy in order to have lived a normal life over the last 15 months. I know I might have, but I can‚Äôt speak for everyone; the government does. The fact that long term effects are prevalent gives credence to public health measures.

I hope you don‚Äôt actually believe lockdowns don‚Äôt work. Just look at the graphs: cases go up, lockdowns implemented, cases go down. Obviously they work.

&gt;If Canadians are hoping for a summer of fewer public health restrictions, then 75 per cent of adults need to get at least one dose of the¬†COVID-19 vaccine, according to Canada‚Äôs top doctor, Dr. Theresa Tam.

&gt;The modelling showed that a possible ‚Äúsafe lifting scenario‚Äù for the warmer months means three-quarters of Canadians need at least one coronavirus shot. Twenty per cent of Canadians will need their second shot.

Actually I've noticed now that other sources are saying the PM said 75% too, rather than 70% as this one has.

What you may see at times is that there were cases where the vaccine had side effects that were *identified* several years later, but that's not because the side effects popped up at that time. The side effects still showed up within weeks. It's just that the vaccine was distributed slowly and not to large numbers of people, so they weren't able to see ultra-rare events for several years.

That obviously isn't the case today; we've distributed more than 1.3 billion doses of the vaccine, and we're able to detect side effects that appear to be literally one in a million (see: the blood clot concerns with J&amp;J). So there is basically no risk or historical basis for concern for long term side effects to pop up out of nowhere in several years.

But going to the bar is more than 20X as likely to give me COVID than anything I was doing before.  In other words, I'm more protected staying away from the bar without a vaccination, then going with a vaccination.  But people never think of it that way.

It's even worse for variants. the vaccines aren't as efficient against some of them.  For example, it's only 75% for the California variant.  Which means that 1 person would get it instead of 4, all else being equal.

[],,Viewfromthe31stfloor,,,[],,,,text,t2_3nelaphm,False,True,[],"&gt;After a devastating year, with wave after wave of coronavirus infections, cases and deaths are falling in many of the Western nations that were once among the hardest hit. But even as the virus recedes in wealthy nations with robust vaccination campaigns, it is pummeling India and threatens to swamp Southeast Asian countries that had until now largely fended it off.

&gt;The result is that, over all, new global cases are leveling off after rising steadily since March and peaking in late April. Still, the world is in danger as long as they remain at ‚Äúan unacceptably high plateau,‚Äù the director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Monday.

&gt;In Southeast Asia, Dr. Tedros noted that ‚Äúcases and deaths are still increasing rapidly.‚Äù

&gt;Cambodia and Thailand, which had controlled the virus throughout 2020, have recorded sharp increases in infections in recent days. Malaysia announced a new nationwide lockdown on Monday, two days after recording its highest daily case total since January.

&gt;Scientists warn that if the virus is allowed to spread unchecked in parts of the world with lower vaccine coverage, dangerous variants will continue to evolve, threatening all countries.

&gt;‚ÄùGlobally, we are still in a perilous situation,‚Äù Dr. Tedros said. About 772,000 new cases are reported on average each day globally, nearly half in India, where a virus variant, B.1.617, has been spreading.

&gt;The W.H.O. deemed B.1.617 ‚Äúa variant of concern‚Äù on Monday. Other variants of concern include B.1.1.7, first identified in Britain and now dominant in the United States, and P.1, originally detected in Brazil.

&gt;In the United States, Britain and parts of Western Europe where vaccines have been widely deployed, the virus is subsiding, and people are flocking back to restaurants and other attractions.

&gt;Vaccines could soon be available to even more Americans now that the Food and Drug Administration has authorized the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot for 12- to 15-year-olds.

&gt;Dr. Robert Schooley, chief of the infectious disease division at the University of California San Diego, said that the global rate of cases ‚Äúremains quite volatile.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄùWe‚Äôre going to see a bit of a Whac-a-Mole situation for some time to come as local and regional outbreaks flare up and burn out,‚Äù Dr. Schooley said. This will continue to be the case, he said, as long as a substantial part of the global population remains unvaccinated.

&gt;Saskia Popescu, an infectious-disease epidemiologist who is an assistant professor at George Mason University, said that Americans should not be lulled into thinking the virus is defeated, because ‚Äúwe have to see the crisis in India as a wake-up call for global vaccine equity.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúCovid-19 isn‚Äôt gone anywhere until it‚Äôs gone everywhere.‚Äù

R0 is the reproductive ability of a disease in a given population, and it is dependent on all the characteristics of that population. 

The R0 for Sweden will be different from the R0 for India. The R0 on lockdown will be different from the R0 when fully open. 

Further you cannot properly compare R0 between diseases for the same reasons. 

Measles could have had a lower R0 had we applied the same mitigation methods to it. Smallpox might have ended up with a lower R0 than covid.

I don't think it's as complicated as you're making it out to be. The US government is *actively limiting* international trade right now -- all they have to do is stop messing with the market, and biotech companies will pursue their normal exports through shipping companies etc. It's not like the US government has to actively manage the logistics.

&gt;And there's still huge pockets of the U.S. population who aren't coming in to receive those vaccines (either the 1st or 2nd dose), which is the main reason why they haven't started exporting yet.

The Ministry of Health suspends vaccination with the AstraZenec vaccine. The minister's decision comes after Friday's information from the State Institute for Drug Control about the probable connection of the vaccine with the death of a 47-year-old woman.

""Vaccination with this company's vaccine for first-time vaccines has been suspended. The Ministry of Health is currently considering several alternatives for how we will proceed in this matter in Slovakia, we are completing all expert opinions and we will inform about it later this week, ""the ministry informs.

In May, more than a million vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and more than three hundred thousand vaccines from AstraZenec are to arrive in Slovakia. Since much of the AstraZeneca vaccine is due to be on the second dose, the vast majority of people should have been vaccinated with Pfizer in May anyway.

Until Tuesday, Pfizer and Moderna in Slovakia vaccinated people over the age of 45 and the chronically ill and proceeded according to age and diagnosis. Now the state will have to decide how to change the strategy for people aged 18 to 44.

People also received appointments for vaccination with AstraZeneca for this week as well. It is not yet clear what they will do with them.

For teenagers aged 16 and 17, they identified Pfizer - the only one possible for this age group so far. However, they have not yet come to the fore.

Probable death

The minister's decision comes after Friday's information from the State Institute for Drug Control. (More infos in English [here](https://spectator.sme.sk/c/22654981/47-year-old-woman-suffering-from-blood-clotting-disorder-dies-post-vaccination.html))    


After months of vaccination, he closed on Friday the third case of death reported in connection with vaccination. The first two came after the Pfizer and Modern vaccinations, they were elderly, and their deaths from autopsy were related to their several chronic diseases.

The third case is the death of a 47-year-old woman who was vaccinated with a vaccine from AstraZeneca.

""According to initial information, this patient suffered from a genetic disorder that was not detectable before vaccination. A group of experts will meet on Monday, comprehensively discuss this case and propose further measures and possible changes or adjustments to the vaccination strategy, ""said Minister of Health Vladim√≠r Lengvarsk√Ω at a press conference on Friday.

The cause of death, determined by autopsy, was related to thrombosis of the cerebral venous sinuses - rafts, ie the veins that drain blood from the brain.

This diagnosis is one of the possible rare side effects of the vaccine.

""Due to the existence of a genetic predisposition to a thrombophilic state, the connection between vaccination with Vaxzevria (vaccine name from AstraZeneca) and subsequent venous sinus thrombosis was determined to be probable,"" writes ≈†√öKL in a press release.

The AstraZenec vaccine has so far been vaccinated with a first dose of more than 440,000 and a second dose of more than 38,000. 177,000 people were waiting for AstraZenec in the waiting room.

[],,oscarwhiskeyoscar,,,[],,,,text,t2_3u2a7cru,False,False,[],"I think it's a consequence of being a public policy organization, whose recommendations have a lot of impact on the population's behavior.

A recent publication to the Lancet (Source: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00448-7 ) found a reduction in cases between 47% (CI 17-66%) in weeks 1-2, and 85% (CI 71-92%) for days in weeks 3-4 after the first dose during Israel's mass vaccination campaign. The main point of the paper was that in the short term, it's safe to delay the second dose in countries where it's scarce. But, it does show that there is some protection gained early-on.

I think the bigger thing though, that nobody is talking about, is the comparison to masking. Cloth face masks are about 67% effective in reducing the spread of the virus (source: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02801-8#ref-CR9 ). So, vaccinated people are personally as protected as well as they would be with a mask.

But the argument for masks has never been protecting yourself - it's always been about protecting the vulnerable. In terms of protecting others, the UK recently found (source: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/one-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-can-cut-household-transmission-by-up-to-half ) that 3 weeks after the first dose, a vaccinated person is 38-49% less likely to pass it on to an unvaccinated person. And after 4 weeks, that number goes up to 60-65% - pretty much as effective as a mask.

Unless I'm fundamentally misunderstanding how probability works (or the studies these are from get trashed in peer review), this implies that there is not much factual basis to requiring vaccinated individuals to wear a mask (aside of their own choice, of course).

The CDC is almost certainly aware of this, and there are some very intelligent (and experienced) people at the head. It's important to remember that in the end, they're a public policy organization - they consider the consequences of their recommendations. For example, if they acknowledged that you're well-protected after the first dose, a lot of people would just skip the second dose (which they shouldn't, because that's what confers long-term immunity). I think right now, they're worried that if they drop the mask recommendation, that a lot of *unvaccinated* people would just use it as an excuse to ignore the guidelines, potentially causing a small spike in cases, which would hurt the plans to re-open before the 4th of July, and which increases the risk of a new variant emerging.

That said, personally, I think that at this point, now that anyone who wants a vaccine in the US has access to one, it's time they should seriously consider dropping mask recommendations for the vaccinated, and leaving it up to personal choice. The ""you need to mask up to protect yourself and others"" argument just doesn't seem to hold up to the facts for the vaccinated at this stage in the pandemic.",,,1620757670,{},gxrcgc0,False,t3_na0gbq,False,False,t3_na0gbq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/na0gbq/cdcs_slow_cautious_messaging_on_covid19_seems_out/gxrcgc0/,1620793593,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Which was easily an hour drive each way from many parts of the service area. Sign up and scheduling was done via a website, email, and text messaging. Distance and technology were a barrier to many residents. Not all parts of my county have reliable internet access and cell service. There are people without computers and cellphones. People who aren't literate. People who don't have a way to physically get to a place an hour away at a specific time. Most people here who didn't get vaccinated didn't want to be vaccinated. But there were a good number who did, but had trouble with accessing the vaccines. Our neighbor isn't a Republican, but he doesn't have a computer, is functionally illiterate, and doesn't know his way around the county where the vaccine hub was located. So he wasn't going to get his vaccine until he could walk into the Walmart pharmacy for it. But he's significantly high risk due to age and poor health. We ended up being his contact with the vaccine hub and driving him. There was no official means of helping people access vaccines.

India was smart enough to install some political control over the vaccine programms , the EU didn`t , so every other rich country ordered in the EU, as it was the only place left with such a big liberal marked for vaccines. And while the EU was sleeping early on , the US and India where already hording materials for the vaccine production. Now India is back in crises mode and doesn`t export anything, the US is still exporting very little (and still not many countries did order direct from the US) and thanks to the DPA the EU is struggling to manufactor more for its  own supply and export of vaccines..

&gt; b) People leaving their residences must continue to strictly comply with the Social (Physical) Distancing requirements stated in this Order and as specified in guidance, protocols, or orders established by the County Department of Public Health. **This Order, beginning June 19, 2020, requires all persons wear a mask over both the nose and mouth whenever they leave their place of residence and are or can be in contact with or walking near or past others who are non-household members in both public and private places, whether indoors or outdoors**. This includes wearing a mask when patronizing a business, except where explicitly permitted differently. Persons engaging in social activities in public settings must also continue to follow these requirements, including avoiding crowds, avoiding poorly ventilated spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, and washing their hands or using hand sanitizer frequently. Wearing a mask reduces the risk of transmission to others from people who do not have symptoms and do not know they are infected. Wearing a mask protects others as well as you. Masks work bestwhen everyone wears one.

&gt; c) Fully vaccinated people2 engaging in social activities in public settings must also continue to follow the above requirements

***When I first lived in Tokyo in 1984, I noticed that people sometimes wore medical masks out on the street.*** When I asked the other ex-pats, they told me that the Japanese wore them when they were sick, to protect others from getting their germs. Being uber polite and group-minded people, this made sense to me. They felt it was their civic duty to protect others.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; it completely destroys the credibility of these measures.

masks this past winter means flu didn't happen.

[https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-the-flu-season-basically-disappeared-this-year](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-the-flu-season-basically-disappeared-this-year)

The flu season has been historically mild this year, thanks to the mitigation measures, such as ***physical distancing and mask wearing***, used to contain the spread of COVID-19. School and office closures also contributed to the unusually inactive flu season.

&amp;#x200B;

24000-64000 ***flu deaths*** didn't happen

400k-700k people ***DID NOT*** go to the hospital for flu.

Sometimes you will see R0 calculated without controlling for disease transmission interventions but this isn't useful for SARS-COV2. This is why the data on R0 tends to use early Italian and Wuhan data sets before people started taking social measures to avoid infection.

Rt or Re (or simply R) is the reproduction rate at a point in time and accounts for all the various measures people take and the immune population. This is what many governments share with people weekly to track the virus.

The reason I raise this is that we are able to contain virus' that R0 is probably the best way of comparing infectiousness we have. It isn't perfect, but we know that SARS-COV2 is not as infectious as many diseases that we control with vaccines alone. This is good.

I agree that understanding super spreaders is important, but only so far.

 ‚Ä¢ ProQuad, which combines MMR and varicella (chickenpox) 

‚Ä¢ Kinrix, which combines DTaP and IPV (polio)

[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson-vaccines-compared/618226/](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson-vaccines-compared/618226/)

The two vaccine trials that did explicitly report hospitalizations as an efficacy outcome make this latter issue very clear. For the [AstraZeneca](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf) vaccine, one person in the control group had severe COVID-19, but eight people were hospitalized; for [Johnson &amp; Johnson](https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download), 34 people in the placebo group had severe COVID-19, but only five people were hospitalized. It‚Äôs true that zero vaccinated people were hospitalized in either study after the vaccines took effect. **But with numbers that small, you can‚Äôt draw a reliable conclusion about how high efficacy may be for these outcomes. As Diana Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research** [**pointed out**](https://www.center4research.org/testimony-of-dr-diana-zuckerman-of-nchr-before-the-fda-advisory-committee-on-j-j-covid-vaccine/) **about the Johnson &amp; Johnson trial, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs misleading to tell the public that nobody who was vaccinated was hospitalized unless you also tell them that only 5 people in the placebo group were hospitalized.‚Äù** She‚Äôs right. And you can‚Äôt be confident about predicting effectiveness precisely in a wider population outside the trial, either. For example, some of the vaccine trials included relatively few people older than 60 as participants.

You can see how fragile these numbers are by looking at those compiled for severe disease. **In the** [**Pfizer trial**](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download)**, for example, just one vaccinated person developed severe COVID-19 versus three in the placebo group‚Äîwhich meant that a single bout of disease made the difference between a calculated efficacy rate of 66 percent and one of 100 percent.** For the [Novavax](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3) and [Oxford-AstraZeneca](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf) trials, there were zero people with severe disease in the vaccinated group versus only one in the control group, so adding or subtracting one would have been even more dramatic. **The problem is even greater for deaths. For that efficacy analysis, only two of the vaccine trials‚Äîfor Moderna‚Äôs and Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs‚Äîreported any COVID-19 deaths at all in the control groups.**",,,1620697015,{},gxohyds,False,t3_n7t406,False,True,t1_gxohn9p,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n7t406/2_new_studies_involving_hospital_workers_suggest/gxohyds/,1620733736,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I live in the Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill area. NC State and UNC were incredible disasters with reopening. Duke did alright, but, as a private, well-funded university, had a lot more resources to do mitigations and fraternities there still almost messed everything up for everyone (both at the university and in the Durham community).

And my alma mater in NY -- they tried to act like everything was okay with some mitigations, but the university president ended up getting COVID and dying.

So yeah, that's why many of us are hesitant to be cheering for universities to be 100% regular this upcoming year.

The September timeline assumes Emergency Use Authorization.  Under full approval, it would take significantly longer.  EUA authorization requires a minimum of 2 months of Phase 3 followups.  Since the 2 dose regiment takes a month, thats a bare minimum of 3 months just to get sufficient data.  If you include recruiting study participants, analyzing the data and then needing the fda and cdc to verify everything, this takes quite a while.

Interesting. I hadn't seen that particular graph. I was using the data here:

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographic](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographic) 

Specifically, 'Age groups with at least one dose administered'.

Which includes both the number of people with one dose, and the percent of the US population in each age group (but not the percent uptake in the groups). Then using the US population grabbed off here (for 2020):

[https://nccd.cdc.gov/ckd/detail.aspx?Qnum=Q155](https://nccd.cdc.gov/ckd/detail.aspx?Qnum=Q155)

Dividing total numbers in each group by the populations I get, ending up with 75% for 75+, 77% for 65-74, 59% for 50-64, etc. I'm a bit confused as to why the numbers are so different.  


Looking a bit deeper into the data the CDC use to make that chart, I can see that they are using the same vaccination numbers as where I pulled them off. But the number of people in each category is off, and I don't know how they got them.   


Summing up the population in all age categories in the CDC document gets you to 302,988,366, which is lower than both the [2010 Census population](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2010/demo/age-and-sex/2010-age-sex-composition.html) or 304.28 million, and the most [recent census population](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/data/apportionment/apportionment-2020-table01.pdf) of 331.1 million. Using the most recent available estimations of population age breakdowns from the US Census Bureau [from 2019](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=population%20age&amp;tid=ACSST1Y2019.S0101), the population in each age band is actually between 5 and 10% higher than used in that CDC release. Resulting in actual vaccine uptake of more like:  


|Age|Uptake Real (%)|Uptake CDC (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|75+|78.3|82.5|
|65-74|80.0|85.3|
|50-64|61.1|65.5|
|40-49|49.2|53.9|
|30-39|43.2|47.1|
|18-29|34.8|37.8|
|&lt;18|3.1|3.4|

By comparison, the numbers in the UK releases directly state:

&gt; Where population estimates are provided, they are based on mid-year 2019 Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates, or populations drawn directly from the NIMS system.

I‚Äôve had several requests for comment on [**this recent** ***PNAS*** **paper**](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/21/e2105968118), which talks about integration of SARS-CoV-2 sequences into the DNA of human cells. I‚Äôm glad to do it, but right off I have to note that a lot of the attention that it‚Äôs getting seems (sadly) to be coming from anti-vaccine activists, who are trying to whip up fear that getting the vaccine somehow means that you will be Permanently Corona-ed. This is nonsense, as you‚Äôll see below (skip to the end for this part!)

Here‚Äôs [**a good writeup**](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/05/further-evidence-offered-claim-genes-pandemic-coronavirus-can-integrate-human-dna) on the paper itself, and I recommend it for background. The first thing to keep in mind is that the coronavirus is an RNA virus, so there‚Äôs a big barrier to getting that integrated into the DNA genome of a cell. You need a reverse transcriptase enzyme, one that runs the usual tape backwards and makes DNA out of an RNA sequence instead. We humans don‚Äôt do that ourselves, but there are plenty of viruses that do. And over the untold millennia, we have been infected by many of these, and a good amount of the stuff that they jammed into our genome is still there. This information freaks some people out when they first learn it, but it‚Äôs true: somewhere around 5 to 20% of our genomic DNA appears to be detritus from ancient retroviruses. Somehow the ‚ÄúIntelligent Design‚Äù folks seem to skip over this ‚Äì go figure. Now, it‚Äôs not all in good shape, because many of these things happened a long time ago. But some of it [**may be involved**](https://www.cshl.edu/the-non-human-living-inside-of-you/) in human disease, in some cases [**possibly through**](https://newsroom.uw.edu/news/genes-%E2%80%98fossil%E2%80%99-virus-human-dna-found-be-active) continued expression of pieces of viral proteins.",,,1620756041,{},gxr8i2h,True,t3_na37ay,False,False,t3_na37ay,/r/Coronavirus/comments/na37ay/integration_into_the_human_genome/gxr8i2h/,1620791463,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I've decided to focus my energy on the vaccine hesitant, not the anti-vaxxers. The latter category are unreachable. But I do believe we can expect to see a steady but not astronomical uptick in those who were hesitant giving in and getting vaccinated as friends and family have done so and put gentle pressure on them by example to follow suit. I never confused the hesitant with the deniers. This is also an area where social media can be helpful. I don't post a lot on Facebook because it's generally become evil, but I definitely posted about my vaccination experience.

I am legitimately trypanophobic. I avoid the doctor and needles at all costs. Just seeing people get vaccinated on the news coverage makes me vomit. Literally. I've gotten to the point where I'm really good at turning away so that it doesn't happen. The night before my first Pfizer vaccination, I didn't sleep at all, and by the next morning, about 4 hours before my first vaccination I was in the middle of a full-blown panic attack. Couldn't breathe, heart rate went from normal to 135 and stayed there for hours after the vaccination, you name it. It's hell. If you've never experienced a panic attack, even though the logical side of you is telling you that you're not dying, the reactive side of you overpowers that and you become convinced that you are. It is so bad. I cried the whole way through that first vaccination.

Yet getting the vaccine itself was actually really easy. My state's department of health has a satellite office 2 miles from my house, staffed with nurses. They were very accommodating, worked hard to ensure that I calmed down before they actually administered the shot. I barely felt it, and outside of having a useless left arm for an entire 36 hours, I had no side effects.

I still had a panic attack before the second vaccination, still cried my way through it, my heart's rate still shot up, but I didn't suffer the insomnia the night before and my panic attack only started about 2 hours before instead of 4 hours before. I had no clinical side effects after the second shot, and even the soreness in my arm was a fraction of what it was after the first.

All of that to say, I really had to make myself do this. I took my husband with me because I knew I was likely to completely panic attack chicken out if he wasn't there making me see this thing through. But I had done a ton of research, I was convinced it was safe, and I knew I had to do it.

&gt;	When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new guidelines last month for mask wearing, it announced that ‚Äúless than 10 percent‚Äù of Covid-19 transmission was occurring outdoors. Media organizations repeated the statistic, and it quickly became a standard description of the frequency of outdoor transmission.

&gt;But the number is almost certainly misleading.

&gt;It appears to be based partly on a misclassification of some Covid transmission that actually took place in enclosed spaces (as I explain below). An even bigger issue is the extreme caution of C.D.C. officials, who picked a benchmark ‚Äî 10 percent ‚Äî so high that nobody could reasonably dispute it.

&gt;That benchmark ‚Äúseems to be a huge exaggeration,‚Äù as Dr. Muge Cevik, a virologist at the University of St. Andrews, said. In truth, the share of transmission that has occurred outdoors seems to be below 1 percent and may be below 0.1 percent, multiple epidemiologists told me. The rare outdoor transmission that has happened almost all seems to have involved crowded places or close conversation. 

&gt;Saying that less than 10 percent of Covid transmission occurs outdoors is akin to saying that sharks attack fewer than 20,000 swimmers a year. (The actual worldwide number is around 150.) It‚Äôs both true and deceiving.

&gt;This isn‚Äôt just a gotcha math issue. It is an example of how the C.D.C. is struggling to communicate effectively, and leaving many people confused about what‚Äôs truly risky. C.D.C. officials have placed such a high priority on caution that many Americans are bewildered by the agency‚Äôs long list of recommendations. Zeynep Tufekci of the University of North Carolina, writing in The Atlantic, called those recommendations ‚Äúsimultaneously too timid and too complicated.‚Äù

&gt;They continue to treat outdoor transmission as a major risk. The C.D.C. says that unvaccinated people should wear masks in most outdoor settings and vaccinated people should wear them at ‚Äúlarge public venues‚Äù; summer camps should require children to wear masks virtually ‚Äúat all times.‚Äù

&gt;	These recommendations would be more grounded in science if anywhere close to 10 percent of Covid transmission were occurring outdoors. But it is not. There is not a single documented Covid infection anywhere in the world from casual outdoor interactions, such as walking past someone on a street or eating at a nearby table.",,,1620734859,{},gxpx3yr,False,t3_n9qzzk,False,False,t3_n9qzzk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n9qzzk/daily_discussion_thread_may_11_2021/gxpx3yr/,1620764546,56,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This is a vaccine being used in the midst of a horrible pandemic, the first thing that matters is that people get vaccinated to help stop the spread, it makes sense to give them protection.

Regardless, that's not how this works.

Vaccines of this nature don't really have long term side effects. Unlike other vaccines, there isn‚Äôt any Covid (killed/attenuated) in this vaccine. All you have is mRNA, which are instructions to make a protein. In this case, this is the spike protein. Normally mRNA is made in the nucleus and goes out to the ribosomes where proteins are made, and then the mRNA is degraded. Here we are just bringing the mRNA to the ribosome from outside. mRNA doesn‚Äôt have the capability of entering the nucleus and making changes to the DNA, where there would be potential to do damage.

mRNA is super unstable and degrades really quickly (in a matter of hours). That‚Äôs why the Pfizer vaccine has to be held at such a low temperature, because otherwise the mRNA would degrade and be ineffective. That short time window + the lack of its ability to enter the nucleus really rules out any risk of significant side effects outside of allergic reactions.",,,1620744135,{},gxqfu7k,False,t3_n9g9y6,False,True,t1_gxqelha,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n9g9y6/fda_permits_use_of_the_pfizerbiontech_covid/gxqfu7k/,1620775567,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
