I don’t think it’ll provide long duration memory immunity, but it’s sterilizing antibody protection, especially against variants is remarkable.

I think of its as an obvious annual vaccine too, and the company almost instantly designing a 
co-influenza/Coronavirus vaccine is proof of this concept. It’s perfect for reducing high levels of community spread because of the rapid and robust antibody response after the first dose. It’s easy to distribute too, but they’re a very small company.

I’ve had COVID. It was incredibly minor for me. Slight fever, few body aches, lost my sense of smell for three days. Whole ordeal lasted less than a week and wasn’t any worse for me than a usual cold (Again, this was my experience. I am aware that for many COVID carries *substantially* higher risks than the “common cold.” I’m not trying to diminish the threat COVID obviously poses.)

I’m young, fit, and eat incredibly healthy. Don’t drink. Don’t smoke. 

What’s the risk of not getting the vaccine for me? I’m already in a group that has incredibly low risk and personal experience has shown that my body is perfectly capable of handling the virus.

Which brings me to the vaccine(s) themselves. Most of the people I know who have gotten the shot have had minor side effects. Aches, slight fever, headaches, chills, etc. I’ve had two friends who needed to take a day off of work after their shots because of the side effects. The side effects from the shots seems to be about exactly the same as the side effects I got from just getting COVID itself. (Again- personal experience) 

Why should I voluntarily expose myself to the common side effects these vaccines carry (soreness, fever, chills, headaches, etc.) and open myself up to slim possibility of developing a serious complication? Especially when it seems that the vaccines don’t necessarily prevent you entirely from getting or transmitting COVID? 

I’m still set with my natural immunity for now, but studies have shown that only lasts a few months. Would it be crazy to just wait until this fall? Especially when there’s already early news that we’re all might need to be getting a booster shot this fall anyways?

&gt;In a [systematic review](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/223/4/550/6009483?login=true) of published studies on transmission of the novel coronavirus and other respiratory viruses, Razani and colleagues found that **less than 10 percent of cases described were spread outdoors.** But they also found frustratingly few papers that detailed the settings or clearly compared indoor and outdoor situations.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Our takeaway from this is that it’s not impossible to get an infection outdoors, even though from what is published, clearly the proportion of when that happens is much lower,” Razani said. She added: “If you are going to a beach — which is a beautiful thing — you should avoid times when it’s crowded, and have your mask, and have a Plan B.”

&gt;While risk of outdoor transmission of respiratory viral infections is hypothesized to be low, there are limited data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in outdoor compared to indoor settings.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Methods**  
&gt;  
&gt;We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed papers indexed in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science and preprints in Europe PMC through 12 August 2020 that described cases of human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Reports of other respiratory virus transmission were included for reference.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Results**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Five identified studies found a low proportion of reported global SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred outdoors (&lt;10%) and the odds of indoor transmission was very high compared to outdoors (18.7 times; 95% confidence interval, 6.0–57.9).**",,,1620432306,{},gxc2bcz,False,t3_n77lk1,False,False,t1_gxc0ncv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n77lk1/the_virus_is_an_airborne_threat_the_cdc/gxc2bcz/,1620486006,48,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,

Shortly after the vaccines received the Emergency Authorization I received a letter from the transplant center saying taking the vaccine was strongly recommended.  I wish I had saved that letter, because I don't remember it saying anything about the vaccine being less effective. 

The first 90 days after transplant is when you are on the highest doses of   immunosuppressive drugs. If the transplant is functioning well at that point the dosages are gradually tapered down to maintenance levels.  WBC levels are monitored with lab tests every 2 months. 

I received my transplant in 1997. I don't get sick very often, but when I do it hits me hard. I was told that you won't necessary get sick more often, but you will be sicker when you do pick up something. This has been my experience. 

BTW I am fully vaccinated.  I didn't have many side effects, so sometimes I wonder if it was effective.  However, I have read that some are just lucky and experience no side effects.

I still have my nursing textbooks that cover a lot of basic validation skills. 6 feet distancing, droplet precaution is covered in fundamentals for validating nursing skills (donning and doffing PPE should cover this) and 6 feet was the recommended distance for the flu.

Hmm, I can't answer that question well. I've read some people write things like ""It is likely that natural immunity won’t last as long as the immunity given to you by a vaccine,"" but I don't know what data they base that off of, so I can't really do a statistical analysis on how long immunity lasts with virus immunity, much less do a comparison between how long virus immunity lasts vs. vaccine immunity.

I do know some of the differences between the *side effects* of getting vaccinated vs. getting infected though. In one, your body *thinks* it's getting attacked, so it does all these things to create an immune response, which can result in a fever and chills and general exhaustion. In another, your body *is actually* getting attacked, so it does all these things to create an immune response, which can result in a fever and chills and general exhaustion. In the latter, your body probably suffers more damage since it's getting attacked.

You lost your sense of smell, so that means the virus *did* damage some of your cells (the virus usually attacks the cells in your nose, mouth, and lungs). In some people, that damage is not that much, while in others, that damage is pretty bad. That is why ""long covid"" can be pretty bad for some people...the damage in their lungs may be so extensive that they lose lung capacity and may never get it back. A friend of mine completely lost her ability to taste certain tastes because some of her taste receptors were too badly damaged. She has yet to regain her full taste palate.

It doesn't seem like you suffered enough damage for it to affect you this time around (e.g. maybe your cells healed or maybe so few of them were permanently damaged that it doesn't feel like a loss to lose those cells). In the future it would probably be better for your body to not be attacked, because if your body is attacked over and over again, you may lose cells with every attack--until you lose so many that you notice your lost lung capacity or your ability to taste certain things.

Sorry mate, thanks for taking the time to write the post and ask the question, but I can only give you a partial answer. =/",,,1620448200,{},gxctjm1,False,t3_n6gqal,False,True,t1_gxcgdor,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6gqal/hey_reddit_im_dr_erica_pan_ca_state/gxctjm1/,1620501945,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

So the reason, some have mild covid and some very severe can be explained (idk how much it has been argued with that but I came to the conclusion by myself) by it too. Because think about it: the later the body detects the virus, the bigger the damage will be, just like with taking late measures. A flu will slowly go from 1 to 100 in like 10 steps while corona will be at 100 by 8 or 9 steps - just for exponential growth to kick in - 1000 by step 9 or 10. 

So your body detecting and fighting the virus just severeal hours too late can make a huge difference. Even if a vaccine stops or inhibits just one point for the virus to dock, it can really put off much speed out of this exponential growth, and it seems to work well. But the same way our bodies have to adapt with the years",,,1620447836,{},gxct0c4,False,t3_n76n8t,False,False,t1_gxbugqd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n76n8t/why_is_covid19_so_hard_to_treat_growing_evidence/gxct0c4/,1620501635,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9EfToFXwx9

Very basic summary is that it can’t get out of your cells.   That’s what cell walls are for.  It’s created, then shredded and bits of it are carefully presented to the immune system.   

A very tiny amount could escape when cells self-destruct.  Most would then be destroyed by proteinases.   That leaves an even smaller amount that might bind to nearby ACE2 receptors (that’s what it’s designed to do).

There’s no way it gets out of a cell, and then wanders away from your arm (ignoring tempting local ACE2 receptors) and ends up on your skin/lungs to be shed.   That kind of journey requires a full/live virus.   The spike is just the bit that allows the virus to get into cells.  The virus itself has lots of other parts that allow it to get out of a cell, through the body and into another person.

If a spike protein could do this (which it can’t), you’d then have the issue of how does it trigger a response in the new person?   If it was that easy, we wouldn’t be messing around with adenovirus or mRNA to make vaccines.  We’d just use the spike itself.   There are some protein based vaccines (Novavax) but they include adjuvants to stimulate the immune system.   Just injecting heaps spike of doesn’t work.

Yes, I share your enthusiasm for everything mRNA, and while you need to be careful how you say things like this on the internet, the “opportunity” to prove that the platform has the goods through the administration of hundreds of millions of doses has slingshotted the science to a place I think most of us thought would take another decade or so. As in: not the kind of “proof of concept” anyone wanted to live (or not live) through, but holy shit is the science exiting. I’m guessing you know what I mean. 

But yeah, there are a TON of regulatory subtleties at play here, and given the complexity of the landscape in general, never mind Covid specifically, it’s just not something that rises to the level of public discourse (and I’m super mindful of the ways in which I talk about this stuff, since it is so often misinterpreted and/or weaponized). 

Your point about Novavax’s performance on variants is exactly the kind of thing I was hinting at when it comes to some of the grey area around “adequacy” - there are going to need to be some nuanced decisions about whether simply having solid efficacy data for X/Y/Z variant is adequate to secure authorization when similar efficacy is implied/anticipated but not proven to same same degree of statistical certainty for currently available vaccines. 

Based on a bunch not-great analogs, I lean towards thinking that things like that will indeed work out in favour of Novavax and the like...but that’s definitely not a sure bet.

I'm not a doctor, so take my advice with a grain of salt, but I like to make the following comparison.

* COVID-19
   * We know the short term effects
      * Possible loss of smell, awful diarrhea, loss of lung capacity (\~80% chance)
      * Possible hospitalization (\~12% chance)
      * Possible death (\~2% chance)
   * We don't know the long term side effects
* Vaccines
   * We know the short term effects
      * Possible anaphylaxis (Moderna/Pfizer, &lt;0.001%)--easily treatable if you wait 30 min after the shot to monitor allergic reactions
      * Possible blood clots (J&amp;J, &lt;0.001% chance)--easily treatable if you get medical treatment after experiencing symptoms like dizziness, limb pain, etc.
   * We don't know the long term side effects

&amp;#x200B;

So...your sibling is gambling either way. Gambling that the long-term side effects of COVID-19 aren't that bad, or gambling that the long-term side effects of the vaccines aren't that bad.

Cuba, for example, has been under an embargo that blocked their ability to participate meaningfully in the international community. They have to create many of their own medicinal therapies because they cannot purchase ours.

They publicly fund both research and health care so their primary goal is prevention and curing. To allow things like hypertension and diabetes to form is expensive. It's better to prevent. They do so by creating neighbor health clinics that do free home treatments and focus on neighborhood medical surveillance for things like mosquito borne diseases.

And they have developed a lung cancer vaccine that has been used for more than a decade.

They pay people to go to medical school so the focus is on being an excellent doctor and not on affording medical school or leave with crushing debt.

And Cuba provides the world with an endless stream of doctors who pledge to serve in poorer countries such as the US and Egypt.

And lastly, Cuba has their own coronavirus vaccine. Afghanistan said that they did not believe US backed vaccines would work because of how high our case count was. Cuba was worried about this and volunteered to transfer their vaccine technology to Afghanistan so that the people could be vaccinated.

I think you are misunderstanding the purpose of that statement or maybe just phrasing your response a bit odd. 

&gt; the intent was that even at the state level it’s not absolute. All rights and powers were intended to be reserved to the people unless explicitly stated otherwise,

Reserving power to the people has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not a state can make a law about something, which is what is at issue here. The intent of that statement, and the others is essentially creating a process to interpret crimes and create laws. 

In essence it is:   
Fed govt can make laws regarding subjects explicitly allocated to the feds &gt; states can make laws regarding all subjects not granted explicitly to feds or not granted explicitly as rights to the people &gt; all actions/subjects that are not covered under the first two are inherently to be considered lawful.

That is to say, if there is no state/local law around something, and no federal law around something, then that something is to be considered lawful such that you cannot be arrested/imprisoned lawfully for something that is not explicitly covered by fed/state/local laws.

Looking at the data from the texas DSHS probable cases dashboard: https://txdshs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/ed483ecd702b4298ab01e8b9cafc8b83

In the seven days following my comments, cases continued their steep drop they'd been doing since January (3000 to 700), then they reversed course 7 days after my comment and went up from 700 to 1000 and held there for the rest of the month. April has been looking better.

So I guess charitably speaking it didn't get worse but it didn't get better either. I was right about the direction but not the amount. That's much better performance than I feared and enough to say I was probably wrong.

Masks absolutely protect the wearers, maybe just as much as others. Why do you think doctors and nurses wear masks in the hospital, only to protect the patients?


The truth is probably something like this, that masks of any form were in such short supply due to people buying them all up that hospitals needed every piece they can get. The CDC probably thought that saying ""masks protect the wearer as well as others"" would make the mask shortage even worse for hospitals, so they de-emphasized the self protection part.


The problem is that they basically lied to Americans. *They went as far as announcing multiple times to Americans that they do not recommend the general public to be wearing masks at that time.* Absolutely criminal. How do you make people trust you and wear masks later on, if you told them wrong or misleading messages to begin with, and give them a reason to doubt you? Long term, this only gave fuel to anti-maskers.


They should have told Americans the truth. Tell us the true nature of the virus, that it is airborne. Say that masks are critical to reducing the virus spread and saving lives, and that we as a country are in short supply of them, and that we need to stay home and save them for hospitals until more become available.

So you end up in a situation where a lot of people are testing daily or multiple times per week, and every single time they test negative that is getting logged as a test and then used to compare against positive results, which again, are only counted a single time even if the same person also tests positive multiple times.

Was it incompetence all around or was there a purpose for not actually “controlling the disease”.

When they said, “don’t wear masks at this time” I was shocked. It made zero sense. Their strategy was to “not create a shortage of ppe for medical personnel” but they could have been honest and said, “look, you need to cover your face with anything you have right now. a cloth, or bandana, or a shirt right”. 

If it came out that there was a new strain of airborne HIV and even a thin barrier of protection like a bandana might prevent you from getting Face AIDS  people would be wearing underwear on their face and working together to stop the spread.

You got the opposite. Everyone against each other. Fighting each other while a virus kills 500k people. 

So what is the plan for the next deadly virus? They need to give us the plan now.

From what I understood from the IP waiver (correct me if I’m wrong) all it means is that if anyone manages to reproduce the exact formula from let’s say Pfizer/BioNTech they are allowed to manufacture it without having to pay any royalties. But it does not force companies to share the fabrication process. Meaning all the labs in the world would first have to reverse engineer existing vaccines and figure out how to manufacture it then only can they think of mass production. This would take months if not years, not solving the current urgency we see in India amongst others. 

Lifting the block on exports of vaccines and vaccine material however could immediately have an impact, tomorrow. 

So in this case the EU is right to say that IP is not a short /middle term solution and that it would be better to prioritise exports. 

That being said, the EU’s position is clearly a sign to big pharma saying: we protect your interests, now protect ours and come back here for your manufactures. 

And I do believe that the IP waiver conversation should happen, to at the very least have this mechanism in place if any similar situation would happen in the future (it could help if it is dealt with from the start with all the different sides of it already discussed and not done in a stress emergency situation).",,,1620473289,{},gxdlimx,False,t3_n7mjaq,False,True,t3_n7mjaq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n7mjaq/eu_calls_on_us_to_push_exports_to_counter_vaccine/gxdlimx/,1620517700,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

If they were *someone* would have taken a look at the airborne vector more then a year ago.   Unless there were other reasons to withhold that critical information.   Sadly the little faith I have in people and good intentions has blown away in the wind during the last year.

Cloth masks even multi layered are not complete protection.  The plastic shields at cash registers offer direct droplet protection but nothing else.   6 feet of distancing only effects large droplets.

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

If the State and Media would've made clear it was related to the original SARS &amp; let everyone know to take the same precautions that were discovered to be beneficial then I think things could've been contained much better.

Shit we knew SARS1 spread easily over MUCH greater distances than 6' via ""small droplets"" from the [Hong Kong Amoy Gardens outbreak back in 2003](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=sars1+aerosol+hong+kong+apartments&amp;ia=web)

&gt; Droplets containing the virus apparently got into some apartment units through dried-out drain traps -- the U-shaped pipes that are supposed to keep gases and waste from coming up back up. Exhaust fans in the bathrooms sucked the droplets into apartments, the WHO report said.
&gt; 
&gt; The exhaust fans could also have moved contaminated droplets into a light and air shaft, where wind moved it into other apartments through open windows.
&gt; 
&gt; Feldmann said there was no evidence the virus itself was airborne, but small droplets can travel up to five feet through the air, perhaps further if helped by a strong wind.

I think the answer will be far closer to ""lockdowns good"" then ""lockdowns bad"".

First, you have to understand the reality that we didn't know the full impact, death rate, communicability, etc early on. In fact, we still don't fully understand these things, as it's a moving target with the mutations. So, erring on the side of caution is good. If you wait to react, it will be too late. And, in fact, this is what happened here in the US. This is WHY states like NY, CA &amp; MI got hit so hard so early.  It was already loose in the community before anyone reacted, state or federal.  

Secondly, the politicization of common sense responses like. Wearing masks &amp; staying away from each other, was a massive mistake. As was the misinformation of ""it's just the flu"", or ""i'm young I'll be fine"" (sure you probably will, but grandpa or aunt sally who's recovering from cancer won't, you ass). 

There is a LOT we will be learning about the past 18 months over the next 18 years. But I have little reason to think lock downs will be frowned upon by history. I strongly believe the anti lock down &amp; anti mask movements will be looked upon with confusion &amp; disgust, as in ""it's so obvious, why was there an argument on this?"". 

Honestly, I think we got very lucky. Had the actual mortality rate been even a little bit higher, things would have got a LOT worse, fast with all the stupid politicization of the response coming from Trump &amp; friends.

Vaccinations have dramatically increased in the States compared to a few months ago. And I'm not saying reduced infections or deaths is a bad thing. What I am saying is that reopening everything without an adequate one-dose or two-dose vaccinated population to provide herd immunity against transmission of COVID-18 invites preventable infections and death to a population. Hell, Alberta currently has a much higher proportion of its population vaccinated (one dose) against covid-19 than it did months ago, but that's not stopping it from having the highest COVID-19 infection rate in all of North America.

So yes, the study is right. 

What’s wrong is the idea that Florida is intentionally cooking its books in a grand conspiracy to downplay its covid rates and deaths.

I believe that people assume a lot more of what science is, than what it really is. I hear many people say, “I don’t believe anything, just science.” Aside from it being ridiculous, because unless they are infants, a human can’t not believe anything, religious or otherwise. It also makes science out as an identity. 

Throughout this pandemic, I have seen science abused to such an extent. Science does not make policies, and much of the pandemic policies were based off of little evidence, or even logic. I live in NY, and the 24 hour subway service is only recently resuming, after a year of closing at night to scrub it down for the purposes of preventing virus spread, which we already could have guessed was pointless a year ago.

“Wait. How do we know it travels several times that distance?

...From recent scientific experiments and paper(s) that challenged earlier hypotheses, that's how.”

My point is that the evidence for 6 feet social distancing was never particularly strong to begin with, especially not to the extent that public policy should have been made concerning capacity limits. A random number was created, based off a hypothetical that *maybe*, the virus spreads less at this distance. That’s what was passed off as “the science” by many experts, and that was used to influence policy. But obviously, that was all just a waste of time.

Once again, I see scientific research as valuable because of the method, and because of repeated testing. Obviously none of this was done to prove that social distancing was effective, and yet that was passed on as “science.”

Just like the obsessive sanitizing, just like hand washing, just like shutting down outdoor events, just like staying at home, most of these had no little evidence supporting them, they were just voodoo. If cases rose in spite of this, then there always was a scapegoat.

“The Science here is basic to epidemiology, virology, biology, chemistry, physics, and probably many other areas I don't know the name of and can't think of.”

And yet, at no point in the past were such non-pharmaceutical methods like lockdowns ever used to stop pandemics. The lockdowns sure didn’t stop this pandemic in most of the regions that had them. They did a whole lot of other damage, though.

Of course, lockdowns were always an experiment. *Maybe* if we do this, then the virus will stop spreading. Not based off of actual research that such an unprecedented, and frankly quite draconian policy worked, mostly a hypothetical. 

Too bad this hypothetical will carry millions into extreme poverty, destitute, and hunger. And too bad this hypothetical didn’t take into account diseases that were not COVID-19. Even if I thought lockdowns did work (I don’t), this carnage that they leave calls into question if they’re actually a good idea. But, oh well, that wasn’t the focus.

Actually, I feel that I might have been too confrontational in my first reply, and I do apologize for that.

The CAA will impose the fine for violating the Civil Aviation Act and Aircraft Flight Operation Regulations for its failure to carry out quarantine and health management measures related to its flight crews, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the CECC, said at a press briefing.

Chen did not specifically say for what shortcomings CAL was fined nor did he directly link the recent COVID-19 cases that have occurred among the airline's personnel or among employees at the Novotel Taipei Taoyuan International Airport hotel to the CAL dormitory.

The CAL dormitory was on the seventh and eighth floors of one of the two Novotel buildings, the one used to provide accommodation and dining services to the general public, Chen said.

The fine was set at a meeting the previous day at which the responsibility of the carrier and the hotel -- part of the CAL headquarters complex close to Taoyuan International Airport -- for the many cases was discussed, Chen said.

Over the past two weeks, 11 CAL pilots, eight relatives of CAL pilots, a CAL flight attendant, six Novotel employees, and three of their family members have tested positive for COVID-19, according to the CECC.

The cases of the Novotel employees, their family members, and the pilots' relatives are considered to have been transmitted domestically, though the exact source of the employees' infection has yet to be pinpointed.

The infections of the pilots, however, have not yet been classified by the CECC as either domestic or imported.

On Wednesday, the CECC said that based on genome sequencing results, it had determined that the virus in some of the CAL cases had the same genome sequence as that of the virus found in many of the Novotel cases.

It admitted, however, that it still did not know the source of the infection and how the virus had spread among the patients.

The Novotel airport hotel consists of two buildings, one of which was designated by the Taoyuan City government as a quarantine hotel in October 2020.
In the other building, the dormitory, which has been the CAL's standard dormitory for flight crews since before the epidemic began, continued to be used as such during the outbreak.

Chen said because the dormitory was not registered with Taoyuan as a certified quarantine unit but still used by CAL flight crews required to be in quarantine without the city's approval, Taoyuan could fine the hotel NT$15,000 for violating the Communicable Disease Control Act.

Also, because some regular hotel guests were given rooms on the eighth floor where CAL flight crews were in mandatory home quarantine, the Novotel could also face fines by the Tourism Bureau, Chen said.

On Thursday, the Tourism Bureau fined Novotel NT$150,000 for mixing general hotel guests and CAL flight crews in quarantine on the same floor, calling it a threat to public health.

Meanwhile, Taoyuan Mayor Cheng Wen-tsan (鄭文燦) said Friday that the city government has written a ticket of NT$15,000 to Novatel for not applying to have its other building designated as a quarantine unit.

As for why the city did not take action earlier on the CAL dormitory if it was not complying with quarantine rules, Yang Sheng-ping (楊勝評), head of the Taoyuan Department of Tourism, said Novotel expressed interest in early March to have the building with the CAL dormitory certified as a quarantine unit.

The city rejected the hotel's request because of management difficulties, Yang said, adding that no CAL flight crews were found to be staying in the building at that time when the city inspected the building.

The city then continued to issue travel subsidies for general guests of the hotel because it thought that the mixing of CAL flight crews in quarantine and general hotel guests on one floor would not happen.
Also, it is the central government's authority to manage CAL dormitories, Yang said, and the CAA had ordered the carrier to make sure the dormitory was well managed.

…

&gt;Now, a new paper from the lab of Whitehead Institute Member and MIT professor of biology Rudolf Jaenisch may offer an answer to why some patients continue to test positive after recovery from COVID-19. In the paper, published online May 6 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Jaenisch and collaborators show that genetic sequences from the RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 can integrate into the genome of the host cell through a process called reverse transcription. These sections of the genome can then be “read” into RNAs, which could potentially be picked up by a PCR test. 

&gt;SARS-CoV-2 is not the only virus that integrates into the human genome. Around eight percent of our DNA consists of the remnants of ancient viruses. Some viruses, called retroviruses, rely on integration into human DNA in order to replicate themselves. “SARS-CoV-2 is not a retrovirus, which means it doesn't need reverse transcription for its replication,” says Whitehead Institute postdoc and first author Liguo Zhang. “However, non-retroviral RNA virus sequences have been detected in the genomes of many vertebrate species, including humans.”",,,1620424128,{},gxbmd8t,False,t3_n77lc8,False,False,t3_n77lc8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n77lc8/new_research_reveals_why_some_patients_may_test/gxbmd8t/,1620476943,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;Jones also alleged that the state ordered her to delete positive test results from January 2020. A spokesperson for the Department of Health responded that the dates Jones referred to were ""event dates"" which corresponded to dates when individuals may have come into contact with the virus, rather than dates when they tested positive.

Jones was then fired for some combination of not doing her job and freaking out and going to the media.

She then created her own dashboard which this sub loved for some reason even though it had a ton of issues like including antibody tests as part of the case load despite this sub being pissed that Texas was doing the same thing. Her dashboard used the same data that Florida was using.

&gt;Her dashboard also differed from the state in how it presented tests: her dashboard counted the number of people tested, while the state counted the number of tests administered.

&gt;The spokesperson also criticized Jones' COVID-19 dashboard for including antibody tests for counting virus tests with antibody tests and for counting non-resident deaths.[15]

&gt;Jones did not challenge the state's data on cases, deaths, hospitalizations, or testing, and she used data from the state in her own dashboard.[15] Her initial allegations amounted to disagreements about the method by which the state computed test positivity rates, which had been previously announced on April 24th, as well as a state policy on reopening of rural counties which was permitted under federal guidelines.[16]

Regarding the raid on her home, she logged into the network and sent a message to a bunch of people and that triggered the raid.

&gt;Florida Department of Law Enforcement said in a statement later that day that a search warrant was issued because Jones was suspected of hacking into a Florida Department of Health computer system and sending an unauthorized message to members of the State Emergency Response Team on November 10, 2020.[21] The alleged statement urged recipients to ""speak up before another 17,000 people are dead"".[22]

She's also got quite the past.

&gt;Jones has had prior criminal charges in Florida. At the time of the police raid, Jones was facing an active misdemeanor charge for allegedly cyberstalking a former student and romantic partner and for publishing sexual details about their relationship online. She was fired from her Florida State University teaching position for threatening to fail her estranged romantic partner’s roommate. She had also faced prior charges, including felony robbery, trespass, and contempt of court, stemming from an alleged violation of a domestic violence restraining order related to the same ex-boyfriend, but those charges were dropped. Prior to that incident in 2017 Jones had been arrested and charged with criminal mischief for vandalizing her former romantic partner’s SUV, but those charges were later dropped, as well.[32][33][34][5] Jones also faced criminal charges in Louisiana in 2016, where she was arrested and charged by the LSU Police Department with one count each of battery on a police officer and remaining after forbidden and two counts of resisting arrest after refusing to vacate a Louisiana State University office upon being dismissed from her staff position.[35][36]

Think of Covid like carbon monoxide. It requires a certain amount, for a certain amount of time, sustained in that time, to infect. Outdoors? It expands endlessly, never building up the density required for infection, diluting rapidly outwards. High wind helps obviously, but its not required. Even low winds are still moving the virus too much for it to be an issue. 

When comparing the amount of viral load inhaled, indoors vs outdoors, its probably less than 1% for outdoors as it is indoors, judging by the research we have on other airborne viruses. In that sense, you would have to be conversing for someone for many, *many* hours, even days, to reach the equivalent to that 10 minute average indoor infection time. 

Consider the fact that just opening a window in a room increases the average infection time from 10 minutes to 45 minutes on average. Let alone literally being outside.

Now, imagine if our CDC scientists listened to Taiwan, who knew on December 31, 2019. Or our own intelligence agencies that also knew around the same time.

Or in other words, copy what Taiwan did.

I would have been called an authoritarian or something if I said we needed to lock down hard for 4-8 weeks starting in March 2020.

Are you saying that humans tend to irrationality? Because that sounds very arrogant, I assume by “rationality” you mean, “people who have different opinions than me are morons, I’m so smart, I wish people could be more like me.”

What “science” is are taking about here. The same science that justified the lockdowns which never worked, and destroyed the economy? The same science that justified obsessively washing your hands, which was never necessary? The same science that justified shutting down outdoor events, which were never a big factor in COVID spread? The same science that justifies 6 feet social distancing, despite that being an arbitrary number, and the fact that COVID can spread just as effectively over several times that length?

By the way, despite not being tied to a religion, all of the above that I mentioned were just as superstitious as believing that breaking a mirror gives you 7 years of bad luck. None of that voodoo ever reduced COVID spread though.

Controversial statement here too, but do you mean the same science that said masks weren’t necessary, and then said masks were all that were necessary?

Now, you might say, “oh, but the science has changed.” But you know what, I don’t think that you actually value “science” at all if that’s your position. Science, plainly defined, is the study of the natural world. And scientific research is a process, not something you “believe.”

What makes scientific research valuable, in my opinion, is the scientific method, I’m sure you learned it in school. Before things are accepted as established “facts” in science, they must be looked, tested, and demonstrated over and over again. A single study which might suggest a correlation does not “prove” it. Something being peer reviewed does not mean that it is true. If science is worth anything, then the “facts” should not be able to change on a whim. Just like how masks were not effective one day, to being very effective another.

Another note here, scientists should not be viewed as clergy, they are not authorities in a faith, they are researchers, and research is the point of “science” when it is plainly defined.

I view myself as somebody who respects science, and scientific research.

India Covid crisis: Did election rallies help spread virus?

[https://www.bbc.com/news/56858980](https://www.bbc.com/news/56858980)

Despite the surge in cases and moves to restrict election-related activities, [**campaign rallies and voting in some states have continued.**](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-56924549)

The ruling party in India, the BJP, has rejected the idea of a link to the rise in infections.

""High cases have nothing to do with religious or political gatherings,"" Dr Vijay Chauthaiwale, of the BJP, told the BBC.

&gt;At the cremation grounds, where the fires only briefly cool off late at night, relatives wait hours for their turn to say goodbye. The scenes are photographed, filmed, broadcast. They are beamed to relatives under lockdown across India. They are shown on news sites and newspapers around the world, putting India’s personal tragedies on display to a global audience.

&gt;Local residents record the fires from their roofs to show the world why they must wear masks even inside their homes. The smoke and smell of death is so constant, so thick, that it covers the narrow lanes for much of the day, seeping through shuttered windows.

&gt;The flames bear witness to the devastation wrought by India’s Covid-19 crisis. They show the losses in a country where the dead and infected are widely believed to be grossly undercounted. They stand as a rebuke to a government accused of mismanagement by many of its people.

&gt;Beyond the images, the cremation grounds bear a painful routine of trauma that will weigh on families long after the headlines fade. The pandemic has stripped the final rites of their usual space and dignity.

....

Yes herd immunity is a thing that we should strive for, and this may possibly be the way to ""incentivize"" people to get the vaccine who otherwise wouldnt.

That being said, if there 16 year olds who have it and 60 year olds who dont, those 60 year olds just flat out DO NOT see the vaccine as a viable option to exist in their life and will not get it.

&gt; During India's first lockdown, it was called one of the most brutal and inhumane. Could it have been better? Absolutely. But it was the best a poor nation could do 

The situation is polar opposite. The first lockdown was a PR stunt to promote the strong man image, literally cities with 0 cases were been shut. Right now, healthcare facilities are collapsing, we need a lockdown right now. Maybe not a nationwide, but atleast a guideline or something to guide states. 

 

&gt;The vaccine roll-out has been criticised constantly. And yeah they did make many mistakes. But as far as I can see only 3 countries - US, UK and Israel have actually managed to do it right. Everyone else has failed.

There are levels of failures, and Indian government is easily the worst failure. I mean the health minister was telling the parliament that government never planned to vaccinate everyone, while simultaneously promoting fucking coronil. They didn't buy doses in advance, they exported doses before vaccinating the at-risk population. We rejected foreign vaccines for the delusion of nationalism, while building a 20000 crore building in delhi, which is completely unneccesary. They didn't give grants to the manufacturing companies on time. They clearly wanted to save money by vaccinating the bare minimum, other countries might have failed, but atleast most of them didn't lack the intent. 

 

&gt;As of this week, 30 countries in the EU/EEA have administered a total of 150 million doses. India - a much much much poorer nation has administered 167 million.

We are around 3 times larger than the EU as well. And no, the poor nation excuse is out of picture when government sanctioned 20 thousand crore rupees for central vista, you could have bought 100 crore covishield vaccines with that money, assuming RS200 price. It is simply ridiculous. 

 

&gt;Remember that at one point, nations that made up just 14% of the world population had pre-booked 50% of the vaccines.

And we have no reason why the biggest vaccine manufacturer of the world wasn't one of them. BJP government didn't book covishiled and covaxin vaccines either, which they could have. Hell, India is the 6th largest economy in the world, we could have been easily in the first ones to be vaccinated. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I spoke with my mates in Netherlands, Italy and Switzerland (I normally live in Holland. Currently back home due to the pandemic) - and no one in the age group of 18-45 are anywhere even close to getting a vaccine yet here I am a 25 year old who has received their first dose.

Genuinely happy about you getting your first dose. Sincere congratulations. I am hoping to get one too. But your case is simply an anecdote because truth is most of the at-risk population is not vaccinated, forget 18-45. 

&gt; But they are nowhere close to the main reason we are in this 2nd wave. 

They simply are. If we would have tried to vaccinate the at-risk population as fast as possible, which trust me, with intent was possible, we could have avoided the overloading of hospitals and people wouldn't have died due to lack of oxygen. 

And let's not forget that BJP government was OPENLY promoting kumbh, enforced multi-stage election in west bengal, Modi was boasting about huge crowds in his rally the day we had 2.5lakh cases. If this is what the leader of the nation does, what can we expect from the people. When Maharshtra was undergoing a brutal second wave, our prime minister and health minister were rallying 24x7 in bengal, instead of helping Maharashtra, and trying to prevent second wave in the country.",,,1620485455,{},gxe4vpi,False,t3_n7nn19,False,False,t1_gxdp0em,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n7nn19/indias_covid19_emergency_the_lancet_editorial/gxe4vpi/,1620528273,16,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

 By Kurt Stenger 06.05.2021

The pressure on the U.S. government to agree to a release of patents on Covid vaccines ultimately became too much: it would actively engage in talks at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to temporarily lift patent rights on Corona vaccines, for example, Washington's Trade Representative Katherine Tai has now announced. The world must respond to the global health crisis with extraordinary measures, she said.

The background is debate over a request India and South Africa submitted to the World Trade Organization back in October. It calls for the suspension of certain aspects of the TRIPS agreement on intellectual property rights for vaccines, medicines and medical equipment in connection with Covid-19. All countries would have to agree to the waiver - the USA and EU countries in particular have vetoed it so far.

Since Joe Biden took office, there have been increasing calls for a change of position in the USA. Experts and NGO representatives launched an appeal, and in April numerous Democrats in the U.S. Congress joined in. Incidentally, the demand is also directed directly at the U.S. government, because the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is itself in possession of important basic patents for mRNA vaccines due to joint research with the manufacturer Moderna. The patents could be released immediately, but the detour via the WTO would take time. The fact that there is any movement at all is probably also connected with the fact that the vaccination campaign in the USA, which is at an advanced stage, is faltering because of the large number of skeptics, and vaccine doses are available in abundance.

The inequity in the distribution of Covid vaccines to date is evident. Seventy percent of orders to date are expected to go to developed countries. The G7 countries are already projected to be oversupplied by the end of summer 2021. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently sharply criticized the fact that Africa has so far accounted for 2 percent of vaccinations - out of 16 percent of the world's population. Even considering that the continent is less affected by Corona than other regions, this is a glaring disparity.

But does a patent release advance global immunization in the Global South at all? The answer cannot be given in a blanket manner and differs for different types of vaccines. For mRNA vaccines, the outlook is negative. The U.S. manufacturer Moderna had already announced in October 2020 that it would not enforce the patent rights to its Covid-19 vaccine. This was probably mainly for image reasons, and to date no one has accessed the patents. Since this is a completely new manufacturing process, no one can actually do anything with the patents - there are probably several dozen for each vaccine. Even for the big pharmaceutical companies, this is new territory; as junior partners of small biotech companies such as Moderna, Biontech or Curevac, they first have to be painstakingly trained. It takes many months to set up or convert a single plant for mass production.

In order to be able to expand production of mRNA vaccines, cooperation is needed above all. Large corporations have experience with mass production, and they have sufficient capital. Such collaborations do exist: Biontech, for example, has production carried out by Pfizer, and in China, Fosun Pharma from Shanghai has taken over commercialization. The aim should therefore be to expand such licensing partnerships. Countries could provide financial support for this. There is another option for manufacturing countries: ""The TRIPS agreement would allow member states to establish a special form of compulsory licensing so that pharmaceuticals can be manufactured exclusively for export to those least developed countries that are unable to do so themselves,"" explains Reto Hilty, director at the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition.

For production, however, the entire know-how and also the basic patents would ultimately have to be passed on. Since this is a novel process that is seen as having great future prospects for other diseases, neither the U.S. nor the EU will be willing to do so. Their pharmaceutical industries have been declaring for weeks that in this case research and innovation on vaccines against new Sars-CoV-2 mutants would hardly be continued. Whether this is an empty threat cannot be answered. But the lobby is finding its ears open.

However, an expansion of mRNA vaccine production would also fail due to practical problems. There is a global shortage of important precursors. There is only one manufacturer of modified guanine nucleotides, which serve as a cap on the vaccine molecule, and barely more than a handful of lipid nanoparticles, which package the mRNA and ensure better transport in the body's cells.

For other covid-19 vaccines, the story is different. Vector vaccines, in which harmless viruses and an effect enhancer trigger the immune response, have already been produced during the Ebola epidemic. Inactivated vaccines, in which inactivated virus components are administered, have been in use for some time, including against hepatitis B or influenza. ""For conventional vaccines, the supply chains already exist,"" explains Sebastian Ulbert of the Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology. ""Mass production of viruses is something that has been well established in recent decades. Now we're talking about the production of these specific viruses for the Sars-CoV-2 vaccines.""

With technological knowledge available in some countries, as well as some experience with production, a patent release could potentially help. Not quickly, but possibly by the end of 2021, experts suspect. However, Astra-Zeneca's vector vaccine is already produced in every continent except Africa (South Africa is skeptical because of unclear efficacy against the virus mutant rampant there), with large quantities produced in India by the world's largest vaccine maker. Astra-Zeneca is already criticizing India for hoarding large quantities and not supplying them to other poor countries as agreed. The subcontinent is currently suffering from a huge wave of infections. The problem is not patents, because they produce two vaccines, including one they developed themselves, but too little production capacity and a vaccination campaign that is barely making headway.

A patent release would affect others than Astra-Zeneca: the U.S. group Johnson &amp; Johnson, for example, and above all producers in China and Russia. Both countries already supply numerous countries in the Global South and use this for foreign policy purposes, much to the annoyance of the USA. This would be a thing of the past if manufacturers from other countries were to enter into production themselves. So is the U.S. government's change of course on the patent issue also a clever foreign policy move?

Products other than vaccines play hardly any role in the patent debate. Yet therapies for covid 19 diseases are no less important than vaccines. Thanks to capacities in India, for example, low-cost generic drug production could provide important services in the fight against pandemics.

Back to vaccines: A patent release would perhaps bring something in half a year. It could also take even longer, since slightly modified vaccines would have to go through new approval procedures on the basis of the patents. But it is not only India that shows that faster solutions are needed. After all, there is a huge mass production of the various Covid vaccines going on in many regions. The problem is the relatively high price of mRNA vaccines - here, the home countries could exert pressure - and, above all, the distribution: The rich industrialized countries have secured 1.9 billion vaccine doses more than they need for herd immunity in their own countries, criticizes Tom Hart, executive director of the development organization One. These would have to be diverted.

But the time factor also plays a critical role with regard to the WTO waiver itself: The proposed waiver of patent rights would only apply for the duration of the pandemic. Since vaccination campaigns are progressing well in many countries and other countries have the epidemic under control with certain measures, the WHO will at some point declare the pandemic over. Then, some poor states will still have to deal with Corona waves - and with the usual tropical diseases anyway.

The science is not yet conclusive on this.

First, vaccination is not a magic shield. You _can_ be vaccinated and still be infected with Covid-19. If you are infected with Covid-19, you can certainly transmit the virus regardless of your vaccination status. Though there are open questions about how transmissible the virus might be, what the typical vaccinated person's viral load is, etc.

Secondly, as far as ""herd immunity"" goes there's generally very little distinction required between those who are largely immune due to having been exposed to the virus or the vaccine. Herd immunity is similar to the concept of a fire going out because it runs out of fuel to burn. If there are enough vaccinated people such that each infected person is only likely to encounter some small percentage of vulnerable others relative to the number they would have in an unvaccinated population to bring the R0 sufficiently close to zero, then we have reached herd immunity.

So, the question about herd immunity and this virus needs to be about whether non-infected and vaccinated people can transmit the virus. At present, the best evidence strongly suggests people who are vaccinated are not likely to be able to significantly transmit the virus.

As more research is conducted in the coming months we will have more definitive answers to this question.

For the moment, however, the lack of sufficient evidence and an abundance of caution means the official guidance is to presume vaccinated individuals are capable of transmission.

In short, we _absolutely can_ reach herd immunity through vaccination if we get enough people vaccinated quickly enough to prevent further mutations of the virus.",,,1620490505,{},gxeeya8,False,t3_n7oqwj,False,True,t1_gxeap9f,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n7oqwj/want_to_party_you_might_need_a_covid_vaccine/gxeeya8/,1620533703,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&amp;#x200B;

the US is still getting about 50k/day. (India and Brazil are seeing more than that)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Despite its simplicity, our quantitative illustration demonstrates that strategies for mitigating the vaccine escape risk should be explored. Reducing case numbers locally should be only one element of these strategies. Travel restrictions to reduce the risk of importing novel variants should be considered. ***We recognise that assessing the escape variant emergence risk not only requires the variant to arise via mutation as considered here, but also to grow to appreciable frequencies***. This is a stochastic process, depending on the availability of hosts to infect and the escape variant's fitness. A reduction in cases leads to both a reduction in the risk of escape variants appearing and a reduction in their subsequent establishment via transmission in the population. Acquisition of additional mutations that are beneficial for the virus is also more likely to be suppressed if incidence is reduced.  
&gt;  
&gt;In summary, high SARS-CoV-2 incidence rates act to increase the vaccine escape risk. Maintaining low case numbers using NPIs and vaccines is crucial at this time.

&amp;#x200B;

interestingly, they don't call it the same thing for the flu.

they call it ***drift***.

Vaccination and ***antigenic drift*** in influenza

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2603026/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2603026/)

&gt;The relationship between influenza antigenic drift and vaccination lies at the intersection of evolutionary biology and public health, and it must be viewed and analyzed in both contexts simultaneously. In this paper, I review what is known about the effects of antigenic drift on vaccination and the effects of vaccination on antigenic drift, and I suggest some simple ways to detect the presence of antigenic drift in seasonal influenza data. ***If antigenic drift occurs on the time scale of a single influenza season, it may be associated with the presence of herd immunity at the beginning of the season and may indicate a need to monitor for vaccine updates at the end of the season.*** The relationship between antigenic drift and vaccination must also be viewed in the context of the global circulation of influenza strains and the seeding of local and regional epidemics. In the data sets I consider — from New Zealand, New York, and France — antigenic drift can be statistically detected during some seasons, and seeding of epidemics appears to be endogenous sometimes and exogenous at other times. Improved detection of short-term antigenic drift and epidemic seeding would significantly benefit influenza monitoring efforts and vaccine selection.

&amp;#x200B;

when do we start talking about COVID drift?

All jokes aside, I kind of think that’s how Covid works too. Some people are shedding an insane amount of virus and those are the times where like all 15 people on the bachelorette party get sick. Or 7 family members get it and 4 die. And some people are shedding very little. And those are the ones who spread it to a housemate and they are both like “meh, barely had symptoms”. 

Also why front line health workers (who even with PPE, but are around people shedding Covid all day) tend to die much younger than regular folks from Covid. 

So yes, ventilation is KEY. Good ventilation dilutes the aerosols much quicker and doesn’t let as big a dose get inhaled by person #2.

Deterioration is sometimes unexpected in SARS-CoV2 infection. The aim of our study is to establish laboratory predictors of mortality in COVID-19 disease which can help to identify high risk patients. All patients admitted to hospital due to Covid-19 disease were included. Laboratory biomarkers that contributed with significant predictive value for predicting mortality to the clinical model were included. Cut-off points were established, and finally a risk score was built. 893 patients were included. Median age was 68.2 ± 15.2 years. 87(9.7%) were admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 72(8.1%) needed mechanical ventilation support. 171(19.1%) patients died. 

A Covid-19 Lab score ranging from 0 to 30 points was calculated on the basis of a multivariate logistic regression model in order to predict mortality with a weighted score that included haemoglobin, erythrocytes, leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, creatinine, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer. Three groups were established. Low mortality risk group under 12 points, 12 to 18 were included as moderate risk, and high risk group were those with 19 or more points. Low risk group as reference, moderate and high patients showed mortality OR 4.75(CI95% 2.60–8.68) and 23.86(CI 95% 13.61–41.84), respectively. C-statistic was 0–85(0.82–0.88) and Hosmer–Lemeshow p-value 0.63. Covid-19 Lab score can very easily predict mortality in patients at any moment during admission secondary to SARS-CoV2 infection. It is a simple and dynamic score, and it can be very easily replicated. It could help physicians to identify high risk patients to foresee clinical deterioration.",,,1620476477,{},gxdppg3,False,t3_n7ngxq,False,False,t3_n7ngxq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n7ngxq/the_covid19_lab_score_an_accurate_dynamic_tool_to/gxdppg3/,1620520050,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I have heard there are some issues with the government not allowing needed supplies past the airport.  I have heard there are problems politically(as there always are all around the world), I think supplies like oxygen, oxygen generators and other needed medical supplies are greatly needed now.  Specifically though, disease mitigation is needed.  People need to Isolate if they are sick.  People they have been in recent prolonged contact with need to Quarantine so they stop the chain of transmission if they are sick.  There are so many things, but testing should be right up there, so you know who is sick and who is not.  Otherwise India should start with Stay At Home orders, and the people should listen to that.  Of course you need vaccines.

It is much more complicated, and I wish me typing this alone would help, but specifically, this thread is about the 50% of people testing positive story and headline.

I'm sorry to hear that. The isolation &amp; economic impact have been hard on ALL of us in one way or another. I have little doubt, that the death's caused by the lock down are dwarfed by those saved by the lock down. Especially early on when we had no idea how to treat the disease. That being said, for you personally, this reality may not make you feel any better about your loss &amp; that is understandable.

This, again, was a failure of government. We had one party refusing to pass the aid programs that would help avoid these scenarios. We had a corrupt administration use the funds that where intended to keep these things from happening as a piggy bank for themselves &amp; their cronies. Other countries, countries very similer to ours, weathered the financial impacts of lock downs much better then we did... in part, because there was more compliance &amp; better coordination. Here, we had some states going hard lock down &amp; neighboring states pretending nothing was happening. That made everything worse &amp; actually extended the need for lock downs.

No, what I meant is that *all* humans (yes, me very much included) are prone to a vast array of [cognitive biases](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases). 

It takes knowledge and a lot of practice and focus just to be able to avoid being caught up in biases somewhat more often than normal.

It is because of these biases that humankind had to develop and formalize more reliable methods to learn about the natural world. The methods, processes, community, education and approaches of science exist to work around these biases so we can piece together accurate models of the physical world.

That is the science to which I was and am referring. 

You provide a list of claims about what you perceive to be failures of what you think is Science with respect to the pandemic. 

Unfortunately, most of us aren't taught very well what Science is in school. I sure as hell wasn't. We get an inaccurate, inadequate, incomplete idea. I had to figure it out over the last 10 years, well into middle age.

Science is a whole system of several things. 

&gt; The same science that justifies 6 feet social distancing, despite that being an arbitrary number, and the fact that COVID can spread just as effectively over several times that length?

Wait. How do we know it travels several times that distance?

...From recent scientific experiments and paper(s) that challenged earlier hypotheses, that's how.

Conducting research to test an existing hypothesis is a crucial part of Science.

We must always be able to challenge and update our understanding. 

Rigid thinking and dogma are antithetical to learning.

I remember a paper early in the pandemic attempting to test spread of the virus inside a bus. It was kind of sketchy but it's all I remember hearing about at the time. There were some papers I read that looked at spread in an apartment and proposed transmission through plumbing, fecal matter, etc. I saw just the other day a new paper that shows the virus spreads much, much farther indoors.

Maybe it looks otherwise to some but this is Science at work.

We know more than we did in Jan, 2020, more hypotheses have been tested for accuracy.

What else can we do, guess and hope? I don't think that will help us learn how the virus (or anything else) works. At least, nowhere near as reliably as Science.

&gt;What “science” is are taking about here. The same science that justified the lockdowns

The Science here is basic to epidemiology, virology, biology, chemistry, physics, and probably many other areas I don't know the name of and can't think of.

We know ways viruses are spread, we know how viruses operate and infect, how the replicate, we understand viruses at the molecular level, we have sequenced tens of thousands of virus samples. 

The knowledge of how to control epidemics is built on a colossal mountain of research in numerous areas.

With new research on this specific virus, we had an idea early on of how it might spread, well enough to know that letting people congregate closely would spread it just as had happened in Wuhan, and just like cold or flu.
