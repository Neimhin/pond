Florida and the coastal Deep South will be battered by ever increasingly strong hurricanes and persistent flooding.  Drought is already hitting ln-land Georgia regularly during the summers too, causing them to have water rights disputes with Tennessee.

Texas will simply have seasonal temperature extremes that make it unbearable to live in.  Nevermind access to clean water. Might be good for oil and natural gas, but not for farming or ranching.

The Plains are feeling the temperature swings, sure, but these people are resilient to weather and have built homes/towns to handle it.  They've seen some crazy shit, it's just going to be more regular.  However, they are very dependent on ground water for irrigation and feeding cattle.  The aquifers are drying up.

The Rockies will have water issues as well.  Snow melt can't be counted on consistently and they face some incredibly hot seasons.  Good luck raising cattle or farming.  Maybe mining towns will make it.

All the folks who leave folks will become refugees.  They will try to play it off as ""We're all Americans!"" Ignoring their prior calls to succeed because they were throwing a temper tantrum about liberal policies on gay marriage, healthcare, taxes, the list goes on.  They'll hate the fact that they are now looked down upon by ""The Locals"" of whatever bastion of society they end up in.

The denominator was everyone in the population, not only people who had gotten COVID.

This has bothered me since day one. Am I a “survivor” because I’ve never had covid? No! You can’t include people that never had covid in the mortality calculations. 

And for AZ specifically, earlier this week we surpassed 0.3% of our entire state’s population dying from covid so whatever number those conspiracy nuts are clinging to doesn’t even apply here because we’re beyond it already. AZ’s case fatality rate is at 1.80% as a whole which is a little lower than it has been due to our current surge in cases. If you drill down to demographic subcategories, the CFR for 65+ is 10.53%. That’s 1 in 9.5 seniors.

[],,SexyCyborg,,,[],,,,text,t2_kcy5k,False,True,,"At least here in Shenzhen, we've been back to basically normal since March 2020. We had 8 deaths, 587 cases since the beginning out of a population of 14 million. I think at least here  in Shenzhen the numbers are reasonably trustworthy because we have a large expat population and it would be hard to hide proportionate cases there. I don't know anyone who has gotten COVID. Certainly no deaths. I can't speak for the data for the rest of China but FWIW I think Shenzhen is pretty legit from what I see and what numbers come out.

No lockdowns or anything like that. We had one month where Delta came through and everyone got tested about once a week but then that was done with. Mostly just vaccines, masks indoors (basic surgical), contact tracing (check-in with QR codes most places), and thermal screening. We're pretty far behind when it comes to FFP2/N95 masking, indoor ventilation, and filtration protocols etc- things never got to that point.

I and almost everyone I know is vaccinated- just the local Chinese ones, and only two. I don't think they are very strong but also no one gets any side effects in terms of fever or soreness so that might help compliance.

I have not seen any sign of aggressive surface disinfection or fomite mitigation measures since the very early days- although I know frozen imports are checked. Chinese scientists are still pretty firm on cold-chain being a potential vector (but obviously only a factor if you are aiming for COVID-zero).

I and almost everyone I know is vaccinated- just the local Chinese ones, and only two no boosters. I don't think they are very strong but also no one gets any side effects in terms of fever or soreness so that might help compliance. China as a whole is 84%, that sounds about right based on my social circle given very old and young would not have it.

No vaccinate mandates, I know two unvaxxed locals (both have VPNs and are active on Facebook as an interesting data point) their QR code says unvaxxed, seems to be a non-issue.

As far as heavy-handed stuff, the messages to go get tested when Delta came through were pretty firm- but it was like a 10-minute wait at a neighborhood testing center. Not a big deal. But nothing really draconian, an occasional reminder to pull masks up when going into malls and such. Things may vary elsewhere but nothing really crazy has come across my feed since the early days.

While I understand that no place in China can be a model for COVID mitigation in the West for many, many reasons, for those who are curious how Shenzhen handled it:

Fuck the difference between the two at .2% is something like 600,000+ people. 

Hell 5.6 million poeple is like if all of Chicago and LA (city limits died)

Also sure 1.5% die

But MANY MANY MANY more suffer from long term affects. I've heard numbers as high as 7%-8%.

wouldn't that be 9x the rate?

if 1/10th of the population (P) is unvaccinated.

&gt;P^unvaccinated = 0.1 * P

and they are hospitalized at the rate of R^unvaccinated .  the amount of hospitalizations for unvaccinated people is

&gt;H^unvaccinated = 0.1 * P * R^unvaccinated

if 9/10ths of the total population (P) is vaccinated.

&gt;P^vaccinated = 0.9 * P

and they are hospitalized at the rate of R^vaccinated .  the amount of hospitalizations for vaccinated people is

&gt;H^vaccinated = 0.9 * P * R^vaccinated

and the amount of hospitalizations is equal between unvaccinated and vaccinated (unvaccinated people make up half of hospitalizations)

&gt;H^unvaccinated = H^vaccinated

&gt;0.1 * P * R^unvaccinated = 0.9 * P * R^vaccinated

the total population cancels out

&gt;0.1 * R^unvaccinated = 0.9 * R^vaccinated

multiply both sides by 10

&gt;R^unvaccinated = 9 * R^vaccinated

or you could just do a theoretical.  say 100 people total and 10 are hospitalized, 5 unvaccinated and 5 vaccinated

the rate of unvaccinated people hospitalized is 5/10 (or 1/2 or 50%)

the rate of vaccinated people hospitalized is 5/90 (or 1/18 or 0.555...%)

the rate of unvaccinated people hospitalized (1/2) is nine times the rate of vaccinated people (1/18)

Why aren't we applying this distinction on more areas then ,or why haven't we done so far ? People who buy more than one car for example are contributing to pollution.

No, instead you get a vaccine and automatically belong to the ""good ones"" ,you are proud of yourself for looking out for the greater good  and you feel entitled to condemn the ones who refuse to get vaxxed . All the while you keep contributing to the destruction of the planet ...

THis to me would imply that there is 'strength of covid' in a person that affects spread of it. lets say at 50% covid u cant get someone sick but at 80% you now can.

Theres a practical benefit to vaccine mandates. Every single country/state/city/company/whatever that announced some form of a vaccine mandate saw a large spike in vaccination rates. That leads me to believe that the actual number of antivaxxers is much smaller than we think and that a lot of the unvaccinated are just procrastinators.

I live in a Canada. In my province we need to show a vaccine passport to go to restaurants, movie theaters and other indoor events. Teens need to be vaccinated to participate in extra curricular activities in school. We have about 85% of the eligible population vaccinated (5-11 year olds are not yet eligible in Canada). Last year at this time we still had some businesses shut down and were not allowed to visit friends and family indoors (so no Thanksgiving or Christmas gatherings) and we knew heavier restrictions would come after Christmas. This year everything is open and we have fewer cases and much fewer hospitalizations and deaths. We have been steadily lifting restrictions and managing the sick to the point where we only have a few deaths per day.

Go ahead and look at Canada's statistics and then compare them to some places like Texas or Florida where seemingly no efforts were made to control the pandemic.

My query is more to the statistical literacy and the messaging being used in the communication of Covid19. The headline for this message suggests an unidentified causality for the increase in confirmed cases without an explanation of the overall possibilities. All unvaccinated people offer the potential for a new infection, and even some vaccinated will fall into that same opportunity. Given the opportunity to infect and thus multiply, any virus will follow this evolutionary pathway. Humans are the most varied behavioral species of mammal known. Human behavior is the key to the spread of this virus. Nowhere in this message does it evaluate the potential opportunities in unvaccinated with no previous infection and those natural antibodies as the issue. None of the statistics offer the window for how much more spread can be anticipated? Americans are terribly unfit as it pertains to lifestyle. Heart disease and cancer strike down the majority of people not achieving life expectancy. Disinformation via any exchange of information between individuals heightens the confusion of the various groups within the overall population. Not every doctor is the appropriate expert to share information about a novel virus pandemic. Not all scientists understand the complexity for the exchange of infections across a given society. Political barriers have caused undue suspicion of opposing perspectives, thus the tribal gathering around bits and pieces of information is driving the rhetoric as well as the behaviors behind the initial spread, and all subsequent infections. The key to rendering a virus less lethal is identifying its outbreak and shutting down the potential spread via lockdown for human behaviors. By the time China made mention of its potential existence, it was already too late to avoid the physical tragedy.

They feel like if they didn't learn it then ""it's stupid and meaningless"". The only way you solve that is by helping to have a generation grow up well educated so that when they are parents they care about it. It takes time to fix and it's definitely hard with stubborn parents.

""We need to do XYZ to fix it"" is always easier then actually doing XYZ in practice. 

You get two types of parents that are unhelpful. One parent thinks that the old way of doing things is the best (because they learned it that way usually through brute force memorizing) and another parent thinks that there is no reason to learn it because it's old and doesn't matter (usually because they didn't learn it themselves). They both fight the different sides of education. One fights good established teaching methods and the other fights newer and better learning methods.

The common thing between them both is they usually both don't have enough time to help educate their child themselves. Which is one of the best way to tell if a child will be successful. Having a parent or both parents able to spend time educating their child and being involved in the process.

This gets into work life balance and the grind of daily work responsibilities that prevent parents from being able to do this though.

[],,Feircesword,,,[],,,,text,t2_1njmryhp,False,False,,"I think for a few different reasons:

1. Babies under 2 tend to not really have much close contact with anyone outside of their household. Two and up is when daycare and preschool usually start. 

2. From what we know, babies cannot catch it easily (exception is childbirth, that seems to be where most infant cases come from*) and cannot spread it easily. They're also less likely to have serious illness or die from it.

3. A fuck ton of vaccinations are already given between the ages 2-18 months. There might be some limitations as to when you can give them their vaccines, because most kids 5-11 have received all or many of their vaccines, so you don't have to worry about how the body reacts (babies especially because of the changing immune system)/how effective the vaccine will be. Two year olds get quite a few vaccines too but not as many as infants which is basically one shot every 2 months for their first 12 months and then a few more at 18-24 months.

4. If babies can eventually get the covid vaccine I'd imagine by the time they're old enough to they'd probably already be fairly close to two years old, maybe 1 1/2... At that point it would probably just be easier to wait until 2 years old.

The players had spent time together in the locker room unmasked, and, according to local guidelines, they could not return to school for at least 10 days.

&gt;Some parents took the news poorly. They told Ms. McIntyre that she should lose her nursing license or accused her of violating their children’s educational rights. Another nurse in the district faced similar ire when she quarantined the volleyball team. This fall, after facing repeated hostility from parents, they started locking their office doors.

&gt;”They call us and tell us we’re ruining their children’s athletic career,” Ms. McIntyre said. “They see us as the enemy.”

&gt;Throughout the pandemic, schools have been flash points, the source of heated debates over the threat the virus poses and the best way to combat it. School nurses are on the front lines. They play a crucial role in keeping schools open and students safe but have found themselves under fire for enforcing public health rules that they did not make and cannot change.

&gt;This new academic year has been the hardest yet, they say. After a year of remote or hybrid learning, schools generally reopened at full capacity; many did so in the middle of the Delta surge and in the midst of an escalating political battle over “parents’ rights” to shape what happens in schools.

&gt;Although 12- to 15-year-olds have been eligible for vaccination since May, uptake has been slow; just 48 percent of children in that age group have been fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vast majority of elementary school students, who became eligible for the shots just two weeks ago, remain unvaccinated.

&gt;Nurses say they are juggling more Covid cases and quarantines — and more furious parents — than ever. “I call myself a fireman and a dentist, because I feel like I’m putting out fires and pulling teeth all day long,” said Holly Giovi, a school nurse in Deer Park, N.Y.

&gt;They are, they say, exhausted and overwhelmed. Some say that, for the first time, they hate their jobs, while others are quitting, exacerbating a school nursing shortage that predated the pandemic.

That could be mostly worthless for stimulating your immune system.  There are studies that on average natural infection is better than vaccination, but the average age in those studies will be above 40 and the average case will be symptomatic.  Studies also show a wide response range of antibodies to natural infection.  There's reason to believe that younger people will predominantly respond via their innate immune system rather than their humoral/memory system, such that an asymptomatic infection in a young person may form little to no humoral response.  If you were asymptomatic it is also possible that you had a high cycle count positive on PCR or a false positive on a rapid antigen test.

So that infection may have boosted your immune system, or it may have done absolutely nothing at all.  A booster is a reliable administration of a known about of antigen which will produce a much more metered response by the human immune system, and which bypasses the innate immune system and will much more reliably lead to the formation of memory B-Cell and T-Cells.

They think it’s silly to imagine life developing out of nothing but they don’t understand just how fucking long a timescale we are discussing. No, a fucking Precambrian organism didn’t suddenly sprout legs one summer’s day and walk onto land and then turn into a primate within a few days or whatever. Millions upon millions of years of tiny little actions and quirks piled up to create us. 

And then the size of the actual observable universe??? That shit bakes *my* noodle and I am relatively intelligent and imaginative.

Our education system at work. I use to tutor people in an introductory course in math in college. I learned very quickly that the reason a lot of them didn't understand their current course was because they had never really understood basic things in math but had ""passed"" all their courses in high school.

I ended up having to teach fractions and division the most. Most commonly they had memorized enough to get by but didn't really understand the fundamental parts of it. 

The amazing thing was that they just never had anyone sit down with them and really explain it. Not stupid people. Many of them I ended up seeing over and over again and a single day of just making them not feel dumb and explaining stuff they were too embarrassed to ask for help for really helped.

They would actually understand the Algebra or the Trig in their college classes but were usually stuck connecting it with the things that they had just never learned well enough in grade school.

Some people don't know what they don't know and I noticed a lot is due to our education system leaving kids behind.

Another is that until very recently, we were testing even asymptomatic cases so the definition of ""breakthrough cases"" was broader than what I think it is in most parts of the US (i.e. you get tested when you have symptoms).

I have never heard of a vaccine meant to hurt any group. There have been vaccines that did end up causing harm (An early batch of the Salk Polio vaccine was prepared incorrectly in 1955 and actually gave children Polio.

It's not a grand, global scientific conspiracy that there hasn't been much of an attempt to replicate then outside of China, it's because the idea is so farfetched that it would be a waste of time. The fact that Chinese scientists are blatantly only doing these studies at the behest of the government, who still claims that that is how covid got into the countr (which, let's be honest, is incredibly harmful and antagonistic), doesn't help either, but if there were any real world evidence to suggest it is a major contributor to the pandemic, it would be studied elsewhere. This isn't even mentioning clothes and other goods. 

You do have a point with the poor vaccines China has come up with, and the procedure for the mRNA vaccines should have been widely shared for free since day one, but note that though the vaccine issue is a problem in many countries, China is essentially a lone holdout to zero Covid. And again, the problem with this is that it is not going to work. Zero Covid for a few months until you get better treatments, I could see that, but with people attacking health officials that suggest that we will have to live with the virus, the expectations are in the clouds. 

In the Northeast portion of the US, we can see what living with it looks like. Vaccines and boosters are readily available, mask mandates and occupancy limits can be turned on and off quickly, and people are generally on board. The result has been that normal life has resumed for the most part for most of this year. As a relatively young person it was also extremely relieving to see this happen for my mental health. We aren't perfect (we still have conservatives) but we are certainly acting more in accordance with all available science than China. 

I'll also mention that it's incredibly naive to expect people to quarantine when coming to China in perpetuity. Even if they test, are fully vaxxed, have pill-based treatments, no known exposure? There are at least tens thousands of people here with family in China who wouldn't be able to go back - two weeks quarantine wipes out a lot of vacation, so you'd be spending several thousand bucks to sit wherever they want you to sit.

*Koh Jun Lin Published:  Nov 12, 2021 8:30 PM ⋅ Updated: Nov 13, 2021 12:08 AM*  
  
**UPDATED 12.05AM** | Added more context on heterologous vaccinations in Thailand.  
  
The Health Ministry has defended its decision to endorse the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech as the preferred vaccine for administering booster shots to people who previously received the Sinovac vaccine.  
  
Moreover, it also unveiled a proposed plan that would see most vaccine recipients eventually get a Pfizer booster once given the green light by the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA).  
  
Nevertheless, it will still be possible for Sinovac vaccine recipients to receive either the AstraZeneca vaccine or Sinovac vaccine for their third dose once this is approved by the NPRA if they are medically unable to receive the Pfizer shot.  
  
“The Pfizer vaccine is recommended by default because that is the priority. Data from the study in Thailand shows the same.  
  
“Therefore, we will go with Pfizer unless there is a medical contraindication. Then of course the other adenoviral platform which is AstraZeneca or the Sinovac that is being given will be considered by the physicians.  
  
“This is something we already have experienced in the rollout because those who cannot the Pfizer vaccine subsequent to an allergic reaction were given Sinovac.  
  
“Same issues here, so we will go with Pfizer first,” said Institute for Clinical Research director Dr Kalaiarasu Periasamy at a press conference in Putrajaya today.  
  
The press conference comes amid widespread vaccine hesitancy towards the Health Ministry rollout of Covid-19 booster shots, especially when it comes to heterologous vaccinations where Sinovac vaccine recipients would get the Pfizer vaccine for their booster shot.  
  
“Heterologous” boosters refer to giving a booster shot that is of a different type than the vaccine used for the primary vaccination, as opposed to “homologous” boosters where the same vaccine is used.  
  
Health Ministry director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said both Sinovac and AstraZeneca have submitted their dossiers to apply for their respective Covid-19 vaccines to be used as booster shots, and both are undergoing review ahead of the Drug Control Authority (DCA) meeting on Nov 17.  
  
To date, the Pfizer vaccine is the only vaccine approved to be used as a booster shot by the NPRA and DCA.  
  
It is currently being prioritised for healthcare workers, senior citizens above 60 years old, residents at long-term care facilities, people above 18 years old with comorbidities, and finally people above 40 years old.  
  
It will be later be expanded to include pregnant women and other frontliners.  
  
Sinovac vaccine effectiveness plummets after 3 months  
  
The boosters will be administered six months after a person has completed his primary vaccination series, except for Sinovac vaccine recipients who will be eligible for their booster shots three months after their second dose.  
  
Kalaiarasu said this is because the Health Ministry Recovam study has found that the effectiveness of the Sinovac vaccine wanes significantly over the period.  
  
He said the study found that the vaccine is 76.1 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 infection during the period one or two months after full vaccination, but this plummets to just 27.9 percent during the period three to five months after full vaccination.  
  
For comparison, the same study found the Pfizer vaccine’s effectiveness drops only from 88.7 percent to 68.0 percent over the same period.  
  
He also presented US data to show that the Pfizer vaccine’s protection against Covid-19 infection wanes for all age groups except those between 12-15 years old, although there are only four months of follow-up data available for that age group.  
  
Similar to the Malaysian study, he showed that effectiveness is high at 88 percent in the first month after full vaccination but falls to just around 60 percent within five months. At or beyond five months, effectiveness drops further to 47 percent.  
  
Protection against hospitalisation remains high with at least 88 percent effectiveness, but Kalaiarasu noted that the US employs a narrower hospital admission criterion compared to Malaysia.  
  
He said people hospitalised for Covid-19 in the US generally require supplementary oxygen or worse, whereas Malaysia also considers other risk factors such as age and the presence of comorbidities.  
  
Kalaiarasu, who chairs the Vaccine Selection Technical Working Group, also presented data from ‘mix-and-match’ studies abroad.  
  
He said data from Thailand shows that when Sinovac vaccine recipients are given a heterologous booster with either an AstraZeneca or Pfizer shot, they produce very high levels of antibodies that would protect against Covid-19.  
  
Thailand was one of the earliest countries to introduce heterologous vaccinations for Sinovac vaccine recipients after hundreds of healthcare workers became infected despite full vaccination in July.  
  
In terms of real-world effectiveness, he said a study in Chile saw two million Sinovac vaccine recipients get either a Sinovac, Pfizer, or AstraZeneca booster.  
  
This was found to increase the vaccine’s protection against infection and against hospitalisation from 56 percent and 84 percent respectively, but the extent of the increase varies by the booster shot given.  
  
The effectiveness of a Sinovac booster shot was increased to 80 percent against infection and 88 percent against hospitalisation, respectively.  
  
The figure is 90 percent (infection) and 87 percent (hospitalisation) for the Pfizer vaccine, and 93 percent (infection) and 96 percent (hospitalisation) for the AstraZeneca vaccine.  
  
For Malaysia, Kalaiarasu said the Recovam study will look into the effectiveness of the booster vaccine rollout in preventing Covid-19 over the course of the year.  
  
Viral WHO video ‘outdated’ with newer data  
  
Meanwhile, Noor Hisham address a video circulating online where WHO top officials urged caution for ‘mix-and-match’ vaccine regimens.  
  
He said the video was recorded in July where the evidence of heterologous vaccinations was still unclear, but the situation has changed.  
  
“So, these are the scientific studies that we have now. So far, we have rollout booster shots namely Pfizer-Pfizer-Pfizer for Pfizer vaccine recipients; and for the Sinovac vaccine that is widely used in Malaysia, we can use the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine.  
  
“This will give better effectiveness which is 90 percent as shown in the Chilean study. We encourage Malaysians: If you have been given an appointment for a booster shot, we find that 40 percent do not turn up for their appointment.  
  
“We advise that they come forward to get the booster dose,” he said.  
  
Previously, Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin had warned that if the uptake of booster doses are low, Covid-19 hospitalisation rates will increase.  
  
The warning comes as the months-long decline in Covid-19 cases in Malaysia starts to plateau, and Noor Hisham has urged for better compliance with standard operating procedures to avert a surge in cases.",,,,1636802376,{},hkg30gd,True,t3_qsz8ni,False,False,t3_qsz8ni,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qsz8ni/pfizers_covid19_booster_preferred_due_to_higher/hkg30gd/,1637091546.0,18,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IFR is Infection Fatality Rate.  It is ideally calculated as the actual deaths over the actual number of cases.  The trick part is knowing the actual numbers.  Looking at excess deaths/all cause mortality can be used to estimate the real number of deaths which shows anywhere from a pretty minor under count in the US to very large under count is Russia.  The actual number of cases can be estimated by checking for antibody levels in the population.  This can be tricky as one really needs to get a truly random sample of the population being studied.

So that’s 7200 within the fully vaccinated, and 8800 within the unvaccinated group. But…. the vaccinated group is a LOT larger than the unvaccinated. If you take the entire population, so including kids under 12, around 73% is vaccinated. That means that 27% of the population has 55% of the (symptomatic) infections. How do you not see this is the problem?? 

And even though there are lots of breakthrough infections, those are generally mild and in most cases do not require hospitalization. So even if the vaccinated were spreading as much as some seem to think they do, this would not be a huge problem if everyone was vaccinated. 

Because when you look at hospital admissions it gets even worse, especially in the ICU, 80% is unvaccinated, and the unvaccinated are only 27% of the population. BUT…  roughly half of the unvaccinated group are children aged 0-12, who are extremely rarely admitted to hospital, statistically irrelevant. So we have a staggering 13-14% of the population making up 80% of the hospitalizations.

I've seen the breathless reports of waning protection against general infection, but I was under the impression protection against hospitalization/death was still quite strong.

Looking at NY States COVID dashboard they track breakthrough cases/hospitalizations/deaths and while they pick up a notable drop in symptomatic infection protection, there was no decline in protection against the most severe incidences. It was 90+% effective against hospitalizations without any major wavering. 

A quick search pulls up a study on Pfizer published by The Lancet:

*""Vaccine effectiveness against hospital admissions for infections with the delta variant for all ages was high overall (93% \[95% CI 84–96\]) up to 6 months.""*

Maybe Topol considers just simply getting COVID itself a ""severe"" situation, otherwise I don't know what he's on about.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 231 million people globally, with more than 4.7 million deaths recorded by the World Health Organization as of 26 September 2021. In response to the pandemic, some countries (New Zealand, Vietnam, Taiwan, South Korea and others) have pursued suppression strategies, so-called Zero COVID policies, to drive and maintain infection rates as close to zero as possible and respond aggressively to new cases. In comparison, European countries and North America have adopted mitigation strategies (of varying intensity and effectiveness) that aim primarily to prevent health systems from being overwhelmed. With recent advances in our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and its biology, and the increasing recognition there is more to COVID-19 beyond the acute infection, we offer a perspective on some of the long-term risks of mutational escape, viral persistence, reinfection, immune dysregulation and neurological and multi-system complications (Long COVID).",,,,1636822852,{},hkh3vc2,True,t3_qt5bgg,False,False,t3_qt5bgg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qt5bgg/uncertainty_around_the_longterm_implications_of/hkh3vc2/,1637112433.0,20,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What if you are a person who is allergic to these vaccines and you basically can't live because you must be vaccinated to buy food, seek medical help and access essential governmental services?

Hundreds of thousands of people have died in the US alone. Nearly 150k American children have lost a parent. It's difficult to wrap one's head around these numbers, but the scale of the tragedy is immense. I can imagine that it's stressful for a child if a parent has to quarantine for two weeks, but it's infinitely more stressful to lose a parent to CoVID-19. You simply can't compare the two. The level of suffering in the US is on an entirely different level from what China has experienced post-Wuhan.

&gt; Zhang Zhan, the reporter who first exposed the Covid disaster in Wuhan

It's terrible that the government has locked her up. However, she did not expose the outbreak in Wuhan. She went to Wuhan *after* the outbreak became common knowledge (1 February 2020, more than a week after the lockdown began) and did some pretty uninformative vlogs (and got into confrontations with medical workers, because she refused to comply with infection control measures, like temperature checks). You can watch the vlogs and judge for yourself.

&gt; If you think the faults and failures made by governments of Western countries is a reason to believe China does a better job, think again.

China has had orders of magnitude fewer deaths per capita than the US and Europe, and people's daily lives have been far less impacted. You can rightly criticize the Chinese government for many things, but there's no question at all that it has handled the pandemic better than the US and Europe.",,,,1636828709,{},hkhhp2j,False,t3_qsb3he,False,True,t1_hkhf7o7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qsb3he/aiming_for_zero_covid_china_focuses_on_frozen/hkhhp2j/,1637120020.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now, what the baseline is can vary greatly by jurisdiction based on capacity, level of care/insurance provided, population age, etc (in US its roughly 200 patients/100K, so +10% = 20/100K)

Given the last 18 months, hospitals may be seeing burnout &amp; reducing staffing levels, leaving less slack in the system for any surge, and with a potential flu season rebound to worry about on top of any COVID increases

Back in august there was a high degree (in the upper 70% I believe) who had 1 shot. But it had lagged at that for a long time, as I recall. This was due to a few reasons:

1. J&amp;J recipients

2. People who got 1 shot of pfizer/moderna and called it good. 

3. J&amp;J recipients who wanted to get pfizer or moderna but couldn't get official permission, so understandably lied and said they were unvaccinated to start their pfizer/moderna courses. 

4. People responding to the Israeli data about boosters and understandably lying and saying they were unvaccinated to get a third dose.


numbers 3 and 4 probably account for a few million. but it also explains why the whole 80+% of the US has at least one shot is misleading. 

Not to say you shouldn't be hopeful. something like 80% of covid patients are unvaccinated, and 90+% of covid deaths are unvaccinated. Part of the lull right now might be due to limited immunity from the crazy record numbers we were seeing (sick unvaccinated people.)

Once that immunity wanes, those who didn't get vaccinated (because they're the type not to wear masks or socially distance either) will be in for another round of getting sick. It wouldn't be unusual to see either:

1. more people getting vaxxed because they see covid doesn't offer natural immunity beyond a few months (unless something has changed that I haven't seen)

2. repeated covid cases (at least at the hospital level) wind up being debilitating so they start de facto social isolating because they don't have energy to leave home. 

or

3. rolling the dice again (especially if they were debilitated after the first go-round) has poor results and they die.

Why? You can't help new patients when there is nowhere to treat them.

&gt;Perhaps their own population took them seriously.

I know a lot of people on reddit believe this is the main reason people don't get vaccines in Russia, but as one living here, I'm sure it's not among the top 5 reasons people are so reluctant to take a jab here. My list would be:

1. Recent decades have taught people not to trust the government in general.
2. A lot of medical staff don't want to get vaccinated and advise their patients not to.
3. Non-coherent politics towards vaccination. QR codes were already being introduced in summer, but then suddenly everything was cancelled (because of oncoming elections) and the whole story forgotten until now.
4. The PR handling of Sputnik vaccine was awful (just look at the name) - they rushed to claim ""we have the first vaccine publicly available"".
5. Western vaccines are not approved in Russia.
6.

Yep. Do not bring a knife to a gunfight. Delta does not play around. I think someone crunched the numbers and a Delta infection is almost twice as likely to result in hospitalization for someone unvaxxed. 

Unfortunately, with Delta, one has to have high circulating antibody levels to avoid infection (it reproduces very fast). After several months, antibody levels have fallen. The cellular immunity takes several days to ramp up after exposure and infection --- that is why vaccinated people have higher viral loads when they test positive.

[],,jdorje,,,[],,,,text,t2_ii7rl,False,False,[],"It's fairly consistent with other data: the one- or two-dose regimens drop efficacy *against infection* down to fairly close to 0% after some number of months.  At the same time efficacy *against severe outcomes if infected* rose over that period.   The number of months varies significantly by vaccine dosage and age of participants; it may also vary by initial dose interval.

This study in particular is looking only at Sweden's very first round of vaccinations; only [8% of the country](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2020-03-01..latest&amp;facet=none&amp;pickerSort=desc&amp;pickerMetric=total_vaccinations_per_hundred&amp;Metric=People+fully+vaccinated&amp;Interval=Cumulative&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=~SWE) had second doses as of 6 months ago.  As such it's likely to include mostly the really vulnerable and healthcare workers, and we'd expect it to show slightly faster waning than studies of the general population.

None of this means anything bad for vaccines in general, it just means we need a 3-dose regimen against Delta.  This is the case with every other vaccine too: even measles, originally just a single dose, was changed to be two doses separated *by 3+ years*.  Polio is 4 doses spread over 5 years. Because we're in the middle of a pandemic we have to rush things, and this means inefficient vaccination where we have to push the doses too close together and use too large of a dosage.

The way efficacy if infected is rising even as efficacy against infection drops after the first set of doses is indicative of how the immune system works.  Initial vaccination creates a huge response of antibodies flooding the bloodstream and mucous membranes, but only a small and unrefined cellular response.  As those antibodies wane the cellular response continues to refine.  Giving another dose once it is refined should raise that cellular response as well as bring antibodies up even higher than they initially were.

Social distancing can help to protect the hospitals if they are overwhelmed.  But that's it.  Social distancing does not protect anyone from infection.  The disease is not going to leave us. Everyone who is unvaccinated, or vulnerable is eventually going to get it.  Social distancing might time shift when someone becomes infected, but that's it.  It's not going to disappear.

Even inside those states, like my state of New Jersey, which is at about 67% vaccinated, there are communities that are having higher covid cases than others due to lower vaccination rates in those communities.

Then you look at other states and they're even less vaccinated. So really what we're going to see as covid turns into an endemic, even as we eventually surpass the 70% number that should be herd immunity, is that only communities that have reached that number will really see herd immunity.

Last year a lot of these countries thought things like masks and contact tracing would spare them a winter wave, but it turned out that masks and contact tracing are only helpful at the margins (and it's not hard to understand why). This year they thought vaccines would do the trick. 

Accepting that COVID will surge around the same time every year, and that nothing can spare them a wave if their neighbor is having one, has been difficult because so much of the messaging, to this day, is that anyone can control it if they really want to. But we still don't fully understand why waves start and why they end, and maybe we never will.

There needs to be a certain amount of fatalism and that means preparing for waves instead of trying to head them off. This is why I agree with the UK's decision to drop restrictions earlier; I don't think it will spare them a big winter wave, but imposing restrictions during a period of low transmission really doesn't do much to help when transmission gets high again.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is rarely fatal in children and young people (CYP, &lt;18 years old), but quantifying the risk of death is challenging because CYP are often infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibiting no or minimal symptoms. To distinguish between CYP who died as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection and those who died of another cause but were coincidentally infected with the virus, we undertook a clinical review of all CYP deaths with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test from March 2020 to February 2021. The predominant SARS-CoV-2 variants were wild-type and Alpha. Here we show that, of 12,023,568 CYP living in England, 3,105 died, including 61 who were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these deaths, 25 were due to SARS-CoV-2 infection (mortality rate, two per million), including 22 due to coronavirus disease 2019—the clinical disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection—and 3 were due to pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2. In total, 99.995% of CYP with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test survived. CYP older than 10 years, Asian and Black ethnic backgrounds and comorbidities were over-represented in SARS-CoV-2-related deaths compared with other CYP deaths. These results are important for guiding decisions on shielding and vaccinating children. New variants might have different mortality risks and should be evaluated in a similar way.",,,,1636809987,{},hkgdh4d,True,t3_qt184k,False,False,t3_qt184k,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qt184k/deaths_in_children_and_young_people_in_england/hkgdh4d/,1637097650.0,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And now, for Reddit's possible *displeasure*, I am going to remind you that:

*just a couple of months ago inFlorida, 25,000 people *per day* were catching SARS-CoV-2, Delta variant, 

and higher than 250 were dying per day. The grand total of deaths from our inability to wear masks, get vaccinated, and control ourselves has resulted in over 60,500 deaths just *this summer*. 

Our hospitals system was on the brink of collapse,

And we are still suffering but recovering from scarcity of liquid O2.

I'm not a germaphobe. I'm an urgent care clinic worker, soon to be COVID-19 Contact tracer..

If you knew how lackadaisical Floridian and tourists alike have been about this pandemic, you would faint. 

If you could see out of my eyes, you would see throngs of hysterical parents beating on the windows at my clinic with their cellphones; moaning, sobbing and shouting at us that they needed treatment. 

You know how many times I called an ambulance for someone suffering from COVID lung, and how many condolence cards I signed for them.

You would see the bedsores on ICU patients and the faces of their grieving families. 

You'd be there every time a nurse cried in a closet.

How callus and foolish do you estimate me? 

Do you have *any* compassion for the over 760,000 who died, nor any feelings for the rest of the probable 1 *million* by the next year? 

Why are members of the public turning into psychopathic narcissists who care for no one but themselves and their pleasure?!

It's certainly possible that China is bad at science and clueless about effective COVID mitigation (although that seems a bit counter-intuitive at this point) but it's also worth considering the West's track record of ignoring COVID mitigation measures that might be unpopular, have a negative effect on business or consumer spending.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;it's not going to work unless they want to shut out the rest of the world forever.

Worked for the past year and a half, what is going to change that it will stop working? People want to come into China, two-week quarantine. What's the issue?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In the US vaccinated people are already living with it and it's not ideal but it's fine.

Well, dying with it, and that's not really fine for us? Different strokes for different folks. All the Chinese I know are pretty happy staying buttoned up rather than dealing with the death and hospitalizations we see elsewhere. Things are pretty good here, why would we open up and accept mass deaths if we don't have to? Remember we're at best, double vaxxed with a fairly weak vaccine and little practice with more strict measures people in the West have become accustomed to.

However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

So that’s 7200 within the fully vaccinated, and 8800 within the unvaccinated group. But…. the vaccinated group is a LOT larger than the unvaccinated. If you take the entire population, so including kids under 12, around 73% is vaccinated. That means that 27% of the population has 55% of the (symptomatic) infections. How do you not see this is the problem??

How is everyone just talking about the vaccinated vs. unvaccinated when looking at ICU positions taken? Since the beginning, it has been known that a large majority of all people taken in the ICU with covid have at least one underlying condition, like obesitas or other lifestyle-related conditions, that resulted in the hospitalization. Somehow it has been decided this is not relevant anymore, because all we want is as much vaccinated people. (So we need to point out everything in terms of vaccinated vs. unvaccinated!)

Getting people to think critically about people and ideas they trust is really hard. Especially when this thing becomes such a fundamental part of their identity. A lot of times the specifics of particular beliefs no longer matter because they're not held because they're true, but rather they're held because of what they signify. It's like getting a Christian to think critically about the Trinity. Nobody really knows what the Trinity is, or how it could possibly exist, yet it is a rock solid foundation of the Nicene Creed that hundreds of millions of people will blindly recite as an element of faith.

Unfortunately a lot of the antivax conspiracy thinking around COVID has become an article of faith. They believe that of course the government is lying to you, so why should they believe any statistics or government reports? It's a convenient way to poison the well and ignore any contradictory information when they want to. Presenting evidence and arguments why they're wrong doesn't usually work very well. Instead it's going to be a MUCH more in depth affair that addresses more root causes about who they are, their own emotional state, why they are readily accepting falsehoods and where they are in their lives. 

Many people believe wrong shit about COVID, but it's not because they've critically examined the evidence. It's because they've become convinced by charismatic people and learned to trust them.

One of the most effective ways of preventing the spread is by testing when you have symptoms, ventilate indoor places, including your home, and by staying at home when you have symptoms. However, at least in some countries, because of privacy laws, positive test results are not allowed to be linked to the status of people's corona app. So if people have taken the jab, they will have access to any place, even if they tested positive for the virus.

Teach math in woodworking. Teach language in cooking recipes. The problem is adults obsession to quantity of someone ""knows"" something.
