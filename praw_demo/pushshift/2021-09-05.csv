Ivermectin is a medication that is used to treat parasite infestations. In humans, this includes head lice, scabies, river blindness, strongyloidiasis, trichuriasis, ascariasis, and lymphatic filariasis. In veterinary medicine, it is used to prevent and treat heartworm and acariasis, among other indications.

Ivermectin effectively suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells and promotes cancer cell death at doses that are nontoxic to normal cells. Ivermectin shows excellent efficacy against conventional chemotherapy drug-resistant cancer cells and reverses multidrug resistance.

Ivermectin proved to be even more of a ‘Wonder drug’ in human health, improving the nutrition, general health and wellbeing of billions of people worldwide ever since it was first used to treat Onchocerciasis in humans in 1988. It proved ideal in many ways, being highly effective and broad-spectrum, safe, well tolerated and could be easily administered (a single, annual oral dose). It is used to treat a variety of internal nematode infections, including Onchocerciasis, Strongyloidiasis, Ascariasis, cutaneous larva migrans, filariases, Gnathostomiasis and Trichuriasis, as well as for oral treatment of ectoparasitic infections, such as Pediculosis (lice infestation) and scabies (mite infestation).[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3043740/#r14)) Ivermectin is the essential mainstay of two global disease elimination campaigns that should soon rid the world of two of its most disfiguring and devastating diseases, Onchocerciasis and Lymphatic filariasis, which blight the lives of billions of the poor and disadvantaged throughout the tropics. It is likely that, throughout the next decade, well over 200 million people will be taking the drug annually or semi-annually, via innovative globally-coordinated Mass Drug Administration (MDA) programmes

Interesting to see they're being proactive in plans to no longer consider people ""fully vaccinated"" if its been too long since their previous shot. That said, it doesn't sound like they're considering the 4th shot to be a part of the original series, but rather a booster after another 6 months meant to help with waning efficacy or are wanting a variant specific booster.

The difference between a booster and a three(+) shot series is the goal of a three shot series is to build the initial immune response to higher levels than what a 2-shot series would give, while a booster's primary intention is to bring levels back to what they were right after the 2nd shot because of waning efficacy. The flu shot is a 1-shot series, but it has to be boosted every year.

And then you have the case of companies not applying adequate safe guards and shipping millions of contaminated doses to Japan, and they latch onto that and feel they were right. And you have the government react with panic and stop giving JJ because of 6 blood clots, and they latch onto that and feel they were right. But to be fair if you hadn't stopped JJ there ""blood clot denial"" theories would come up, they just wouldn't be as strong because it wouldn't become an attention grabbing flash point.

Resistance to this vaccine has become part of their identity. Messaging does not change identity. It can only strengthen it, particularly when part of that identity includes resistance to authority about this very subject, as well as a belonging to a community of like minded people, and also being ""right"" about something everyone else is ""wrong"" about.

This is why they'll jump all over horse dewormer as a ""treatment"" for a respiratory viral infection, but they won't take a vaccine tailored to treat this specific virus. Because they think it's the secret knowledge they have, that's spread in their community, and the authorities are saying not to. 

This is why they have grown to reject germ theory and adopt alternate and long since abandoned theories of disease and health.

As for J&amp;J the thing is more complex, because it uses adenovirus. This means that if you took J&amp;J vaccine you are likely have antibodies for the coronavirus as well as the adenovirus that delivered the DNA of the spike protein. So likely a booster shot might not be as effective, because body might neutralize the adenovirus before it can do anything. This is likely the reason they didn't go with second shot like Astra Zeneca did (why make a possibly ineffective 2nd shot when you can turn it around and advertise that only single shot is needed?)

IMO they should just allow people to take different vaccine for a booster shot. Normally that's recommended and it's done with other vaccines that require a booster.

I believe the only reason they ask people to take the same one is to keep tracking of side effects and efficacy.

&gt;Dr Philip Hyland, Senior Lecturer at the Department of Psychology at Maynooth University, says the research showed that in Ireland, those who were hesitant about taking a Covid-19 vaccine were more likely to be female; a younger age (35-44); less altruistic; more likely to hold irrational beliefs (endorse religious and conspiratorial beliefs); lack trust in authority (lack trust in government, scientists, doctors/healthcare professionals); hold anti-migrant attitudes, and believe that one's own social group is superior to other groups in society. He says that the best data available suggests that about 5-10% of people in the general population oppose vaccination of any kind.

&gt;In the US around 18% of adults are said to be vaccine resistant, according to a recent Gallup poll.

&gt;Younger adults who are politically conservative, those who are rural based and from lower socioeconomic groups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant, according to Prof Kapuscinski.

&gt;While there is also significant vaccine hesitancy among black Americans, which is declining, indigenous people in the United States have the highest vaccine rates of any racial group, Prof Kapunscinski said.

&gt;This has been explained by community leaders as being due to a strong emphasis on collectivist values -""the conviction that personal choices should consider what is best for the group. In this view, choosing to be vaccinated shows care for not only people important to you, but also other people’s friends, neighbours and grandmothers.""

&gt;Prof Hyland believes people with anti-vaccine attitudes cannot be reasoned out of their views. He says ""their position is a faith-based belief system"".

&gt;They ""hold a rigid belief and engage in motivated reasoning"" to dismiss all evidence or reason contrary to their belief, ""focus selectively on information that supports their belief"", and ""distort information so that it fits with their belief"", he said.

&gt;""We would not make accommodations for people who believe the world is flat, and I don’t think we should make any accommodations for people who believe vaccines are unsafe and refuse to take them during a global pandemic where millions of people are suffering and dying,"" Prof Hyland said.",,,,1630917107,{},hbsdeq0,True,t3_pipjkd,False,True,t1_hbre2t8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pipjkd/vaccine_resistance_persists_despite_projab/hbsdeq0/,1630993657.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,Kamots66,,,[],,,,text,t2_jwq0s3,False,False,[],"This is a bit long, it's a copy/paste (with a few personal bits removed) from a message I sent to a friend yesterday morning after a night working in the ICU, needing to vent about this very thing:

&gt;Last night was a rough one. We've finally reached the point where the covid population in the hospital is a problem not only in and of itself, but their mere presence is affecting the ability to effectively care for other patients. We literally had to play musical patients last night after a doctor was forced to make a brutal decision regarding just how critical he considered two different patients. We had a guy processing through the ER, and it was clear he was going to need to be in the ICU stat, but the entire ICU was full. Zero beds. (We try to keep at least one bed open in ICU, a ""code bed"", if someone codes somewhere in the hospital, or someone comes through the ER that needs to immediately be in the ICU.) When the doctor initially came to the ICU, he and the charge nurse had a long conversation about which patient they might move out to a regular floor, and at the end of it, the doctor was like, nobody, nobody can go, they ALL need to be here. Meanwhile, I'm watching this guy in the ER---the hospital has an app where I can track the progress of people through the ER in case I need to get things ready in ICU---and he's headed downhill. The doctor leaves, but then about thirty minutes later, he calls and asks for the charge, and he's decided to move out one of the patients and admit the guy from ER! BUT, because the hospital is so stressed and understaffed, that process took FOUR hours! The doctor made the decision just after midnight, but it wasn't until about a quarter past four that they finally were able to get him to us. We had to move out the previous patient, get the room cleaned, nurses had to make/take reports on both patients moving, etc. Even just the process of getting rooms clean is compromised! We needed the room cleaned stat, but again due to understaffing and overstressing of the staff who are present, nobody from ES was available to properly clean and sanitize the room. The hospital coordinator called and asked if we could clean the room. We did it, and while we certainly know how to clean things as part of critical care, we don't have the specialized training or experience in cleaning and sterilizing rooms between patients. We certainly don't have the supplies that the ES people use. We did our best and used almost an entire container of disinfectant wipes to clean every surface, and then the hospital coordinator came up and mopped the floor. It seems minor, but multiply this situation a dozen or a hundred times a day, and in other areas more vital than just cleaning a room (which admittedly is not a trivial matter, especially if the departing patient was covid); the quality of care is suffering. There are too many patients and too few staff, and now we're having to juggle patients, and doctors are being forced to make what seem like lose-lose decisions about who gets critical care or not.  Which brings me to the sad part. The whole process took too long. The guy from ER rolled in and his daughter was following. I took her to the waiting room while we assessed him, and it was just immediately apparent that he wasn't going to make it. Maybe getting him into critical care six hours earlier wouldn't have made a difference---he was in rough shape regardless---but fuck, it's not going to help! The covid numbers had dropped a bit over the past couple of weeks, but they are trending upward again!  At one point last night while the coordinator was in ICU, I asked her if covids were, in fact, trending upward again as it seemed. She said yes, and she said what's really scaring her is that the cases this week seem to be a direct result of school opening two weeks ago, and that while we haven't seen many yet, the number of adolescent cases is increasing.  Sadly the only thing keeping our beds open is that the covids don't usually make it very long. It's a sad situation where covids in the ICU are essentially just waiting to die so that more covids from the covid wing can move over. Maybe 25% of the covids we get in the ICU will leave alive. Only about 5% will leave alive if they have to be ventilated. But it just really struck home last night how much people simply needing normal emergent or critical care are having the quality of their care affected by the covid patients in our hospitals right now; it's probably happened before on other shifts when I wasn't present, but last night was the first time I experienced it directly, and it was disturbing. Anyway, rant over, sorry to dump on you, but I just woke up---got home at 8 and slept about 4 hours---and I could tell I needed to get this out of my head or it was going to be distracting me all day. No need to reply or engage in discussion, just needed to get it out, and for that, I thank you for just being there. :) &lt;3",,,,1630938330,{},hbt822s,False,t3_piwf1p,False,False,t3_piwf1p,/r/Coronavirus/comments/piwf1p/doctors_in_these_states_could_soon_be_forced_to/hbt822s/,1631008533.0,190,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agreed, exactly.

I'm not sure why you've convinced yourself that this specific vaccine is going to suddenly cause people to have chronic health concerns 30 years from now, but there's no evidence to support that fear. However there's evidence to support the fact that covid causes permanent damage to your body in about 40% of cases, including asymptomatic and mild cases. 

The US government's unwillingness to do adequate lockdowns and quarantined at the start of the pandemic to ensure elimination absolutely did cause it to spread. They prioritized the economy over human lives and forced people back to work and back into public with no vaccines and no protective measures knowing that the virus would rip through the populace and become endemic. But they cared more about what their wealthy donors wanted than they did about us. 

As to the existence of a world government, in a sense you could say that the US is currently as close to that as exists, but finally China is starting to balance against that, very slowly. The US is still undeniably the boss of everyone and the one who sticks themselves in everyone's business and forces them to do what we want, or kills them, however. 

As to the spooky shadow whatever whatever you're hinting at, that doesn't exist. In any form. The UN is the closest thing to what an actual world government would be like, and it just is consistently useless in part because of the veto power of the jerks who colonised the entire world in the first place, but also because it has no enforcement mechanism and also because it is beholden to the interests of capital and administers horribly abusive bodies like the world bank.",,,,1630947323,{},hbtsir3,False,t3_pj0soe,False,False,t1_hbtrcd7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pj0soe/the_delta_variant_is_making_covid_a_pandemic_of/hbtsir3/,1631019028.0,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

TWiV did an episode on this topic with Western scientists who know and have worked with the scientists from China you reference, and they did not believe that anything big was being covered up based on their firsthand interviews/conversations with said scientists. I think it’s this episode: 

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/this-week-in-virology/id300973784?i=1000523243265

Maybe the western scientists are also in on it? That seems less likely to me, though. 

&gt;Covid from the onset seemed pretty adept at human infection, how could that have happened so fast? It would take an insane amount of nature's luck to be that way out of the gate.

Wouldn’t the fact that a virus jumped to humans by definition mean it had evolved the ability to infect humans? Happened plenty of times (HIV, Ebola, SARS-1, avian flu, swine flu) and is still happening every day. Within months we had variants that were better adapted and more contagious. Would it not be very likely the first human host maybe wasn’t great at being contagious, but if they even infected one other person, that it began evolving and adapting to be more efficient by the time we detected it in December? By some accounts there’s evidence SARS-CoV-2 was circulating as early as October. Two months could have resulted in the variant that spread around the globe in December/January, no? 

&gt;I'll always call back to smallpox, in today's society the odds of eradication would be zero and it would be a human induced disaster.

&gt; that the vaccine has mercury and formaldehyde in it

It actually doesn't. They literally list the excipients and preservatives in the pamphlet you get. In fact, half the problem of shipping the vaccines had to do with a lack of preservative agents.

&gt;the vaccine contains embryonic cells

It's literally mRNA in packaged nanoparticles. Stem cells are not used to synthesize recombinant mRNA or adenoviruses.

&gt; general suspicion about the speed of its development

mRNA and adenovirus technologies have been under development for years prior to COVID under Phase 1 and 2 trials. Making the message is the easy part, and ultimately the testing is pretty simple. Plus all the ingredients have been well-characterized and previously approved in different applications.

Realistically though we have to let everyone who wants to (plus kids who don't lie to get vaccinated) all catch COVID, but at a slow enough pace to not overwhelm hospitals.  Flattening the curve is now, finally, the correct approach.

If that means something like 5% of the population catching COVID a week and we have to get through 30% of the population catching it, then it could be as little as six weeks.  But keeping things flat and reasonably high (not way too high or near zero) is not easy at all.

This is simply a massive misunderstanding of risk reduction, and I feel like public health messaging has mislead people into thinking they can *eliminate* risk, rather than mitigate it. This leads to people being extremely disheartened when, despite taking many precautions, they still get infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Bicycle helmets work; yet sometimes people die in cycling accidents while wearing a helmet

Seatbelts work; yet sometimes people die in car accidents while wearing seatbelts

Vaccines work; yet sometimes vaccinated folks get COVID-19

In reality, we know that both vaccines and infection provide a high degree of protection from re-infection. If 100% of the population got the vaccine, the R would be less than 1 and the virus would disappear. If 80% of the population gets the vaccine, plus some number of people have natural immunity, the same results.  We're going to meet somewhere in the middle between natural immunity and vaccine protection, and then we'll be done with it.

[],,ForGoodness-Cakes,,,[],,,,text,t2_3v2rld60,False,False,[],"Just wanted to note I'm from Jefferson County but haven't lived there since I graduated high school. I now live in SoCal.

Interesting thing, I'm an ESL teacher who has lived and taught overseas. Specifically, I taught in Wuhan China for 3 years before moving make to the US. I moved back 1 year before covid hit. All my friends, colleagues, and students who were still living there started panic messaging me as covid hit the city. They sent me videos of dead bodies in the streets and hallways in the hospitals. It was horrific.  I lost people.  I began panicking because I KNEW it was coming. Something that shuts down a city like that can't be contained.  

I told everyone to prepare.  My significant other, his family, my family, friends. They all thought I was fucking crazy. I have fibromyalsia and was having horrible flair ups from the stress. I was prepared though. Our house was ready. 

My parents still live back in JC in Alabama. My sister is 17 and has been sent back to school with no mask mandates. My mom has had covid and is a long-hauler. My dad has had it twice, the second time was worse. My dad still isn't vaccinated.  

I have no idea how to help them. Its like a completely different world. My mom constantly talks about the fear of someone in our family dying but then still goes out shopping (she does wear a mask). 

I don't understand why I keep hearing people say its over. I have friends bashing other friends for going to Hawaii while they are at a large concert this week.

I'm so tired of this. I'm so afraid of getting sick. The long hauler symptoms are so similar to fibromyalsia.  I don't need a double dose of this hell.

Sorry, I've found myself rambling.  I just can't explain the thinking of some people. So many have passed. There are so many orphans and broken families.  

I'm a teacher now who can't go into the classroom because of my health conditions. Unemployment has helped protect me and now everyone is loosing it. The same people who won't wear a mask and tell us to stay home are the same ones taking away our financial ability to protect ourselves.  

I've even gone back to school. I haven't wasted the opportunities provided but I'm treated like a leech for making the decision best for my health. My job as an educational instructor at the local interactive science museum is still closed. Normally I teach esl online from home but China has shut all the ESL companies down this month in a major political move to control foreign influences. Thousands of ESL teachers are now without a job.

There are so few options and it feels like a lot of this is coming from selfishness and a basic lack of empathy and compassion.  

I think I just needed to rant. I'm tired. I'm tired of begging people to consider their neighbors and community members.  

I hope everyone can make it through this difficult time with as little negative impact as possible.

Hospitalizations and deaths are easy to define and easy to measure, and there we do have the data that these severe effects (at least pre-delta) are indeed rare. Mis-c also appears to be rare.

Long covid is different. [Disclaimer: I'm not a scientist, but I read a lot (too much)]. From studies and discussions I've read, long covid is hard to define and hard to measure, it can seemingly affect anyone who's had covid regardless of severity (asymptomatic and mild included), there's no agreement on what ""long"" is, it seems to affect multiple and varying organ systems, it's not yet clearly known if vaccines prevent it, there are varying theories as to what causes it (from autoimmune to brain damage to residual virus, and some medical professionals dismiss it as anxiety driven or psychosomatic). There are only a handful of studies (if that) in pediatrics that focus on long covid, and from memory the estimates range from 2.5%-8% of those who've been infected. There are more adult studies and I've seen ranges here from 10%-30%+. All of these studies define long covid differently, define what ""long"" is differently, have differing and not always useful sample sizes, many include self-reported metrics (probably less reliable), some include imaging before and after covid (probably most reliable), many don't have control groups. Unfortunately, long covid in general doesn't seem to be well-studied nor well-understood yet, and this is even more true for children where it hasn't been studied very much at all. It seems that this is changing, there are now long covid centers in various hospitals including for pediatric patients, it seems more attention is being paid to the long term effects of covid in general, and hopefully there will be real answers sooner rather than later.

For now, from my perspective, even looking at the smallest estimate of 2.5% of infected children - given the US's very uncontrolled and seemingly not very surveilled spread - 1 in 40 children who've had covid of any severity may presumably have some ill-defined version of ""long covid"". 1 in 40 just doesn't seem rare to me. My hope is very much that it is rare, or short lived, or won't affect quality of life after all, but I just can't bank on hope as a strategy when trying to figure out what to do in the present moment with my unvaccinated kids.",,,,1630902383,{},hbrt8rt,False,t3_piiabx,False,False,t1_hbrlllx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/piiabx/parents_of_kids_with_longcovid_warn_that_children/hbrt8rt/,1630983317.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Size: More data always increases our confidence in the results, provided no other fatal flaws. This study is absolutely large enough.

Methodology: Did the researchers set up the study to appropriately test their hypothesis? In this case, they wanted real world data, so they went into communities, and measured compliance and COVID prevalence. In my eyes, the test is reasonably designed. This aspect can be hard to judge at face value.

Type of Study: Some studies take large chunks of data and try to make correlations (such as ""women who own horses live longer"",when the actual reason may more likely be that ""women who own horses have enough money to pay for health care""). When it comes to studies, the Randomized Controlled Trial is king, and that's what we have here. One reason this study is powerful is that no one can say ""oh, masks only work in a perfect environment, like a laboratory"". This isn't just an academic test of particulate filtration rates: it's a real life measure of actual COVID prevention.

The main problem with the “lab leak” idea is the same problem with massive conspiracies. People often point to how early on heroic healthcare workers in China were sounding the alarm at great risk to their safety and careers. Some were later silenced by the government but not before getting the word out about SARS-CoV-2 (before we knew that’s what it was). And those people were held up as examples for how not even a very tightly controlled authoritarian government could keep things quiet. 

For the lab leak to have occurred and then covered up would mean hundreds of people keeping quiet. Dozens of scientists. Scientists in China are not as political as party officials. 

Dunno, that just seems much more far-fetched than what we’ve observed happen before that caused a pandemic in a VERY similar virus (SARS-1) from animals from the SAME region in China being present at a wet market in Wuhan. 

Plus none of this has any bearing on how WE should prepare for the next pandemic.

[],,tentkeys,,,[],,,,text,t2_2ppp8j5,False,False,,"This study hasn’t been peer reviewed *yet*, but it’s methodologically sound and credible.

Unfortunately, that’s something it can be hard for the lay public to gauge — people with years of training as scientists will read a pre-print and decide for ourselves (if it’s close enough to our own fields/training for us to understand the details), but most people don’t have that kind of training/experience.

My advice for someone who doesn’t have the scientific background to evaluate a pre-print for themself would be to look at who it’s from, and look at what credible sources are saying about it.

In this case, this was a massive collaboration involving Berkeley, Yale and Stanford - for this study to be bullshit would require major mistakes or misconduct from multiple scientists at three top universities. Yes, people at top universities sometimes still engage in scientific misconduct (eg. that food researcher at Cornell), but when you’ve got a big collaboration involving researchers at several prestigious universities, they’ll be keeping an eye on each-others work (and probably debating each-other endlessly over the details) so you’re probably pretty safe trusting the results. So the “who it’s from” part gets a thumbs up.

As for what credible sources are saying about it, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/pbo8yv/misinformation_is_bad_good_information_is_good/) is a list of some good, lay-person-friendly credible sources, including some science news sites and science blogs written by people who have the training to be able to evaluate studies like this and whose work is well-regarded by other scientists. If they’re writing about a study, you can consider a positive opinion from them to be kind of an initial informal review and preliminary stamp of approval. If multiple credible sources are writing good things about it, that’s even better than just one.

You can also learn about evaluating studies for yourself. Start by auditing some courses on Coursera that use words like “research methodology” “study design” “bias” and “confounding”. Once you think you’ve got the basics down, try reading some studies credible sources have good or bad opinions of, and see if you can understand the details of why they think that particular study is good or bad.

The study is not fraudulent per se, and they had a really nice setup with randomization, but they did *not* measure whether the masks reduced infections of covid19. They thought they did, but they tried to save money on tests, and shot themselves in the foot this way, and ruined their own study. It was a honest mistake, but they fucked up, and tried to discuss the consequences of the fuck-up deep in Appendix F and H.

It was their intention to measure real effects, but the way they did measurements, they really did not. The authors also know this, and they admit to it in Appendix H: 

&gt; **Our pre-registration document suggests that we can compute the impact of our intervention on seroconversions by comparing our effect size to the difference between endline and baseline seropositives among individuals symptomatic during our intervention. As the analysis in Appendix F makes clear, this is not quite correct.** If P(prior) , the fraction of symptomatic seropositives due to infections prior to baseline, is zero, then the estimated impact on symptomatic seropositives equals the impact on symptomatic seroconversions and no further adjustment is needed. More generally, the impact on symptomatic seropositives incorporates both seroconversions, as well as reductions in symptomatic seroconversions due to non-COVID respiratory diseases. **We cannot determine the impact on seroconversions without knowing both P(prior (0)) and the relative impact of masks on COVID-19 and non-COVID respiratory diseases.** If the latter two quantities are equal in proportion, the impact on symptomatic seropositives again equals the impact on symptomatic seroconversions with no further adjustment needed.

Yet, in their press releases they spinned this study as the definite proof that masks work. Of course, everyone is obviously gobbling it up, because it confirms their beliefs. But if they took time to read the entire preprint, they would have caught this. People just read the press release, started making headlines, whilst in fact a critical reader should have been alarmed by the term ""symptomatic seroprevalence"" in the abstract of the preprint already. When I read that term, I thought:  ""Hmm, that's a weird thing to measure?"" Then I started reading the actual preprint, and the whole study just unravelled.

But the confirmation bias is so strong, that even Nature in its daily briefing send me a news article saying claiming that there was strong proof masks work. I bet they also didn't take the time to read the preprint, which is the very least someone could do before relaying non-peer-reviewed paper as a source of knowledge into the media.",,,,1630908508,{},hbs2nck,False,t3_pisf38,False,True,t1_hbrxl4a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pisf38/largest_study_of_its_kind_finds_face_masks_reduce/hbs2nck/,1630988231.0,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Actually what research has shown is that those who have had covid *plus* a vaccine do much better than either alone:

The latest research reaches the opposite conclusion of a pre-print study the Cleveland Clinic released in July.  
While the new study isn’t surprising news to infectious disease experts, they say this study, based in Kentucky, backs up what they suspected to be true.

&gt; Taiwan had blamed China, which claims the island as its own territory, for nixing an original order from the German firm this year - charges Beijing has angrily denied.

&gt; Taiwan's government then allowed major Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier Foxconn - formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (2317.TW) - as well as its high-profile billionaire founder, Terry Gou, along with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW), to negotiate on its behalf for the doses.

&gt; The first batch of BioNTech shots arrived last week. A Taiwanese Buddhist group has also ordered 5 million shots, with government approval.

&gt; Writing on his Facebook page, Gou said the second batch of vaccines should arrive before the end of the week, with the third batch coming around the middle of the month.

&gt; ""Following on, it is estimated 700,000 to 800,000 doses per week will come as weekly arrivals, so the target of 8-9 million doses this year will be reached as soon as possible, but we are also working hard to get more to Taiwan this year,"" he added.

&gt; BioNTech did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

&gt; Gou was not able to be at the airport to welcome the first batch as he was in quarantine after returning from a trip to Europe.

&gt; He said that ""at the moment"" there were no plans for him to receive the second batch in person to ""avoid dragging in lots of people"".

&gt; Taiwan is getting the shots, jointly developed with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), earlier than expected as a delay in regulatory approval of the shot for use in mainland China made a surplus available for the island. The vaccine is approved for use in Chinese-run Hong Kong and Macau.

&gt; Taiwan's COVID-19 pandemic is well under control, with a vaccination programme proceeding smoothly, though only around 5% of the population are fully inoculated.

Another example of doing so would be telling a figurative story where mask and vaccine allows them to stay healthy, so then they can continue performing their favorite sport without interruptions, which also allows meeting some hot chicks along the side.

If emergency rooms are overflowing, and nurses and doctors are shouting at the top of their lungs to reporters and twitter and anyone who will listen, then --- yeah, I believe those doctors and nurses.  

I also believe the numbers, for example, Kaiser compiled stats on who was hospitalized, who was in ICU, who was dying--- whether they were unvaccinated or vaccinated.  This is pretty simple stuff.  Some people with followings have said this is all a lie, it's all to get money, numbers are inflated, etc.  There's no evidence that local and state officials are cooking the numbers. The claim that only 6 per cent of covid-related deaths were actually caused by covid stems from a misunderstanding about how death certificates are filled out and the CDC has since clarified this (and also stated that if covid is not included in the chain of events that led to the death, it should be left off the death certificate).  

A good way to find out whether information is good is to seek out information that disagrees with it, and then evaluate both points of view.  Use your questions to find keywords that can be used in search engines.  This defeats search engine algorithms.  But it takes time.  Considering these are life-and-death questions, the time is worth taking, imo.  

One more thing because I'm hearing a lot about how people are hostile to other points of view, and this is true.

My 5 year old daughter caught covid. It's great that she came out of it ok, and if that's all that happened it wouldn't be a huge issue.

However, because of the covid diagnosis, we had to take our 7 year old delayed son out of school, too. He missed out on all of his IEP stuff, and only had a handful of workbook assignments to do for the 11 days he was out. My daughter's entire class had to stay home for 5 days to monitor for symptoms. My wife, who just started her first job in 7 years the week before, had to take time off to take care of the kids and assist with learning. Fortunately, I work from home, so no big change for me there. 

My daughter was mostly isolated to the bedroom she shares with her brother, while my son slept on the couch, and I slept in the spare bedroom. We wore masks constantly, sanitizing as necessary. It was nice outside, so we were able to more or less spend time as a family outside, again masked and distanced. Friends were turned away at the door, not a whole lot of affection, probably too much movie time. Didn't get to visit my parents, which would have been the first time in 1.5 years.

Fortunately, all of that kept other people from getting sick, too. But yeah, just because the parents are vaccinated doesn't mean it's not a huge impact to everyone's lives, whether they live with us or not.

And the infections from superspreaders often result in higher amounts of virus in those they infect, again, increasing the likelihood of more superspreaders appearing in that chain of infections.

The high overdispersion and the nature of social circles results in a relatively high number of circles with far-above-average infection rate.

This was quite evident earlier into the pandemic. When someone in your social circle was infected, it was pretty likely that the virus would spread within your circle, and it was overwhelmingly likely that if you knew even just one infected person, your chance of encountering more infected people (or getting infected yourself) grew much higher than before. That was why so many people didn't even believe in the virus - you hear about all those infections, and naive statistics suggest that you should have many infected people around you, but they were actually concentrated in a proportionately small number of groups (where the concentration continued to grow, while your social circle still had much lower chance of getting infected due to avoiding it in the first place), and many more groups didn't have anyone infected (well, confirmed cases).

Edit: And also, social circles tend to include like-minded people, and most groups have either disproportionately high or disproportionately low numbers of members who adhere to public health measures, are vaccinated, etc. This again contributes to the overdispersion within social circles.",,,,1630936300,{},hbt3wk3,False,t3_piisj8,False,True,t1_hbra7ki,/r/Coronavirus/comments/piisj8/us_hits_40_million_covid_cases_as_delta_variant/hbt3wk3/,1631006533.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it seems to be an inconvincing argument because people see all kinds of conflicting information, including information from medical experts who are against the vaccines (we have 3 or 4 notorious ones here). And this brings the impass. People see the arguments from both sides, they can't make a reasoned decision and then their fear takes over. And their fear tells them not to vaccinate because it can be dangerous.

&gt;Top federal health officials have told the White House to scale back a plan to offer coronavirus booster shots to the general public this month, saying that regulators need more time to collect and review all the necessary data, according to people familiar with the discussion.  
&gt;  
&gt;...Less than three weeks ago, Mr. Biden said that **contingent on F.D.A. approval**, the government planned to start offering boosters the week of Sept. 20 to adults who had received their second shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine at least eight months ago. ...Administration officials have said that recipients of the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine would probably be offered an additional shot soon as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;...Dr. Woodstock (the acting commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration) had argued that it was risky to set a firm date for a booster rollout before regulators had a chance to thoroughly review the data, some of which had yet to be submitted by the vaccine manufacturers, and decide whether shots were safe and necessary,  
&gt;  
&gt;...Among the reasons for delaying is that regulators need more time to decide the proper dosage for a possible third Moderna shot. The company’s application asking the F.D.A. to authorize a booster shot contains insufficient data, one federal official familiar with the process said. Other data expected from Johnson &amp; Johnson has not been delivered.  
&gt;  
&gt;...They have been arguing strenuously that the administration lacks the data to justify a broad rollout of extra shots and should instead concentrate on vaccinating the roughly 25 percent of Americans who are eligible for shots but remain unprotected.",,,,1630935310,{},hbt1ylr,False,t3_pi89zf,False,True,t1_hbrog1n,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pi89zf/daily_discussion_thread_september_05_2021/hbt1ylr/,1631005577.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selfish people never realize their selfish the very nature of western culture the one we both live in is extremely selfish. We take up huge amounts of resources 

&gt;All I’m telling you is that people are getting sick and tired of this crap and want to go back to the way things were pre covid.

It's because we're so used to having easy lives filled with entertainment and yearly vacations. I don't care if people are sick and tired of not being able to go to these things, it doesn't mean they're not reckless and short sighted and part of why this pandemic isn't ending.

&gt;And as long as they’re fully vaccinated they’re fine. 

Unless they have kids who they can spread the virus to, or create new variants that the vaccine doesn’t work on.

&gt;And I’m also saying that as long as more people get vaccinated I’ll be traveling, going to concerts, sporting events and other gatherings like that again once the virus becomes more and more less deadly. 

You say you're not selfish yet you can't stop talking about what you'll be doing with complete disregard for spreading variants of the virus because you're fully vaccinated.

&gt;If you don’t want to go to any large gatherings despite being fully vaccinated that’s fine. But don’t tell me or anyone else not to. But that doesn’t also mean that they’re being selfish. It just means that they don’t want to put social gatherings on a hold for another whole year.

I'm not telling anyone to do anything I'm saying it's reckless and short sighted to go to these events even if you're fully vaccinated. Just don't be surprised when an easily predictable outcome like new variants that kill vaccinated people start showing up and everything needs to get shutdown again. 

It absolutely means they're being selfish they're doing things purely for entertainment because they're one of the people lucky enough to be born in Western society and have enough money to do these things. The vast majority of the people in the world are too poor to go to concerts or travel on vacation.

&gt; Orange County has barred county health officials from providing COVID-19 updates at a county supervisor’s news conferences.

&gt; The briefings held by Supervisor Katrina Foley had become one of the few sources of regular COVID-19 information in California’s third-most populous county after the Board of Supervisors stopped providing updates by its top health official at its meetings and suspended press briefings by health officials for several months.

&gt; In response, Foley launched on Aug. 9 her own regular COVID-19 news conferences. On Thursday, however, the chair and vice chair of the Board of Supervisors — Andrew Do and Doug Chaffee — ordered county officials to stop participating in the briefings.

&gt; Do, in a statement, said the news conferences were political stunts that provided information that was already available. Foley said the regular health updates were needed to combat misinformation and sound the alarm about the Delta variant and its effect on hospitals, which have been strained by the numbers of COVID-19 patients entering emergency rooms.

&gt; Only after Foley began her COVID-19 news conferences did the county Health Care Agency, on Aug. 13, resume its own regular press briefings, now held weekly on Friday afternoon.

&gt; “We’re just trying to give accurate health information out to the community, and they claim that it’s a waste of staff time to participate in these calls,” said Foley, who featured county health officials and other experts, such as doctors from local hospitals and an epidemiologist, at her events. “I think the information that we’ve been sharing has caused more people to question some of the misinformation that’s coming out.”

&gt; In the statement, Do characterized Foley’s COVID-19 news conferences as events designed to boost herself politically. Foley, a former mayor of Costa Mesa, joined the Board of Supervisors this year after winning a special election to replace Republican Michelle Steel, who in November won a seat in Congress by defeating Democratic incumbent Harley Rouda.

&gt; “We have updated numbers on COVID-19 posted daily, followed by weekly press releases and press calls by the county’s CEO team and our county health officer,” Do said. “Taking county staff away from their jobs for private publicity events is not the most appropriate use of public resources. It is an abuse of power to use county executive staff to self-promote.”

&gt; Foley’s news conferences were initially held five times a week; most recently, they were held twice in one week.

&gt; In the briefings, county health officials and other experts alerted the public when hospitals began to show signs of strain as the fourth wave of coronavirus infections intensified, explained the importance of mask wearing and offered tips on how to stay safer during the Labor Day holiday.

&gt; Besides reviewing the latest numbers of cases, hospitalizations and COVID-19 conditions in the county’s schools, experts were also available to counter pandemic misinformation, a problem U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy has declared an “imminent and insidious threat to our nation’s health.”

&gt; Foley said the news briefings were not an attempt to get her quoted in the news stories more often. Foley said she invited Do and Chaffee to speak at Thursday’s briefing, but they declined.

&gt; “Whether or not I’m quoted in these stories is irrelevant. It is important that the information is getting out,” Foley said.

&gt; Foley pledged to continue hosting COVID-19 briefings even if county health officials are not allowed to attend and said she would invite other healthcare professionals, including those from the state Department of Public Health, to speak and take questions.

&gt; But it’s still a problem if local health officials can’t attend, as they are the ones with the expertise on Orange County, Foley said.

&gt; The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors hears a COVID-19 report from its public health officials at every regularly scheduled meeting, often spending more than an hour listening to officials and asking questions.

25ug: 183,652 (122,763–274,741)	

100ug: 371,271 (266,721–516,804)	

250ug: 582,259 (404,019–839,134)	

What didn't change much between 100 and 250 is the viral neutralization test. So since their seemed to be no additional effectiveness boost and 21% of participants developed severe side effects at 250, they went with 100. 

The reason I'm concerned is that delta lowered antibody binding efficiency, so that combined with waning levels... That's why there was a drop. If the trend followed, 50 and 100 might perform equally short term, but how long would that last?

A ""checkpoint"" is a kind of protein messenger that both cancer cells and immune cells use to signal the body. Immune cells need to have an off switch or they can overreact (the dreaded ""cytokine storm"" that's been in the news so much is a type of immune signaling overreaction). Cancer cells take advantage of this pathway by providing their own signal proteins, telling the body not to worry about them, they're harmless, go away.

Scientists have found some really good targets on cancer cells that *only* grow on cancer cells. One of the therapies that's been successful in treating cancer is to send it a molecule via a shot that basically waves a flag at the immune cells, saying ""hey, this is a baddie cancer cell, look at it!"" That part of the process is similar to the covid vaccine in that we're injecting an antigen with the hope of getting an antibody response. The problem is it's completely hit or miss. A small sub-segment of cancer patients has a miraculous response. But most have no response at all. One of the theories for why not is all this interference created by the cancer cells and the lack of immune t-cells that are present as a result. 

So...the first shot in the 1-2 punch is something called a P-D1 inhibitor. It is also called a checkpoint inhibitor. It locks up those proteins made by the cancer cells that tell the immune system to look the other way. Think of it like crowd control, clearing out all the gawkers, so the cops that are already on the scene can clearly see a robbery happening in front of them and call for backup.

I'm old enough I had measles as a kid like every other kids I knew did because the MMR was not routinely given when I grew up. Then in my lifetime it was eliminated (2000 in the US, I believe). Then it came back due to the antivaxxers. I'm not even 45 years old. It can be done but people forget real history so quickly now due to the mass amount of misinformation online.

Measles had a higher complication rate than Covid in children too: about 2 in 500 die, 1 in 1000 got encephalitis- lots of people my age and older are partially deaf from measles- and SSPE kills about 1 in 10,000 measles sufferers a decade after they've recovered and probably forgot they even had it.

Meanwhile, many Massachusetts patients can’t get the treatment at all.

Now, as infections continue to climb, and hospitals across the state are stretched thin, Massachusetts is racing to catch up.

“The best strategy to remain protected from the worst of COVID-19 is to get fully vaccinated,” Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, chair of President Biden’s COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force, said in a recent White House press briefing. “But if you get COVID-19 and you’re at high risk . . . the monoclonal antibodies work. They are safe. They’re free. They keep people out of the hospital and help keep them alive.”

The drugs, which are typically delivered by infusion, are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the body’s immune system and stop the virus, keeping people with COVID from getting seriously ill, if taken within 10 days after symptoms appear. Research that has not yet been peer reviewed indicates the treatments can reduce the risk for hospitalization and death by about 70 percent, and can shorten the average duration of symptoms by four days (down from 14 to 10 days), compared to patients who did not receive the treatment.

“That’s really astonishing and comforting to see as an infectious disease doctor, compared to the beginning of the pandemic when we didn’t have many things in our arsenal,” said Dr. Sandeep Jubbal, who runs a monoclonal antibody treatment clinic that UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester opened in mid-July

But many Massachusetts hospitals have limited ability to offer the life-saving treatment, in part because the infusions require significant space and staff commitments. Massachusetts public health and hospital officials placed a much higher priority on setting up vaccination clinics rather than specialized treatment centers.

Currently, the UMass clinic alone administers roughly half of the 210 monoclonal antibody doses reported weekly in the state, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. Jubbal said the free clinic is drawing patients from as far away as Maine.

Former president Donald Trump brought wide attention to treatment with monoclonal antibodies last October when he was hospitalized with COVID and received infusions of the experimental drugs. The next month, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for Regeneron’s monoclonal antibody treatment.

At that time, with limited data available about the drug’s effectiveness, overwhelmed health leaders in Massachusetts mostly stayed away from the therapy. Many last winter noted the daunting process for administering the drug, typically given intravenously over 20 minutes in an outpatient setting, followed by an hour of monitoring for adverse side effects.

But several states where a higher percentage of residents have declined to get vaccinated than in Massachusetts began pushing monoclonal antibodies as a way to reduce the danger of COVID. DeSantis may be better known for blocking public schools from imposing mask requirements, but he also set up 21 monoclonal antibody centers that his office estimates have treated 30,000 patients so far.

Mounting infections here, combined with increasing evidence of the drugs’ success, is prompting some Greater Boston hospital networks to open or greatly expand monoclonal antibody clinics.

“By the first week of August, it was clear that demand [for antibody treatment] was going to outpace our capacity very soon,” said Dr. Ron Walls, chief operating officer at Mass General Brigham, the state’s largest health care network. “The demand tripled between the second week of July and the second week of August.”

Mass General Brigham is poised to more than double its capacity later this month to administer the treatment across its system, from 41 to at least 95 doses weekly, and if that still doesn’t meet demand, it can expand to 140, Walls said.

The system’s hospitals, like many in Massachusetts, are bulging with patients who deferred care for other problems during the pandemic and are now seriously ill. That’s in addition to the recent rise in COVID patients.

“Treating people early with monoclonal antibodies and reducing the likelihood they end up in the hospital, or are not as sick if they need to be hospitalized, is the right thing to do, for the patient and for resources system wide,” Walls said.

Fueling demand is the FDA’s action in late July to greatly expand eligibility for the treatment. In addition to people 12 and older who test positive for COVID-19 and are considered high risk for complications, the drug can now be given to those who have merely been exposed to someone with COVID and are at high risk for severe illness and hospitalization, such as people with a compromised immune system, or who are obese, elderly, or have chronic kidney disease.

However, demand is running so high that Mass General Brigham currently only treats high-risk patients who have tested positive. Beth Israel Lahey Health system has also similarly limited treatment, but Dr. Richard Nesto, Beth Israel’s chief medical officer, said plans to open a second treatment site at its Burlington medical center next week may allow the system to offer it to more patients.

“We had a big supply of medication and no demand three or four months ago,” Nesto said. “But the surge [in cases] has dramatized the demand for this.”

Now, health officials find themselves walking a tightrope. They still want people to get vaccinated, yet they also need to promote a drug that can save patients — even if they don’t get their shots.

“These strategies are not competitive; they are complementary,” said Dr. Howard Koh, a former Massachusetts public health commissioner and assistant health secretary in the Obama administration who is now a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “Monoclonal antibodies prevent those with high risk or early disease from getting sicker, while vaccination prevents people from getting disease in the first place.”

At Tufts Medical Center, nearly 500 patients have been treated with antibodies since December and just seven of them ultimately required hospitalization, said Dr. Helen Boucher, an infectious disease physician at Tufts.

“It’s made a lot of difference in patients’ lives,” Boucher said. “But vaccination is still our most important tool.”

Like Tufts, Boston Medical Center also is reporting a rise in demand for the treatments, though it only has sufficient space and staff to administer antibodies to two patients a day. While most have been over the age of 55, there have been some younger patients seeking the treatment more recently, a hospital spokeswoman said. Sixty-four percent of the patients are from lower-income neighborhoods.

Amid the recent spike in COVID infections in many nursing homes, the state’s health department last month urged nursing home leaders to promptly seek monoclonal antibody treatments for infected residents and said the state would provide the medication.

But Dr. Asif Merchant, chief of geriatric medicine at Newton-Wellesley Hospital and partner of a company that runs medical services for 45 nursing homes in Massachusetts, said too many facilities lack skilled nurses to administer the treatments, so the drugs are not being widely used.

“The state has tried to be helpful, but simply offering the drug without staff who can administer it doesn’t work,” said Merchant, who recently partnered with a pharmacy to administer the treatments for free to nursing homes. “This is a drug we know can save lives, but there are too many hoops to go through.”",,,,1630904916,{},hbrxc0i,True,t3_pisshs,False,True,t3_pisshs,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pisshs/massachusetts_good_luck_getting_access_to/hbrxc0i/,1630985491.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sorry about your mother and sister. I am just amazed given you are not in a heavily populated area that you have so many infections. I am in Australia. Sydney is 5million and delta escaped from quarantine into the community. We have about 100 dead in this wave. Total deaths since the beginning is about 1000. 1k. I didn't forget any zeros.

The pandemic was messed up in USA from the beginning. I don't know how you get the genie back into the bottle.

In NSW which is the state where Sydney is located there are about 8 million people. We were slow to vaccinate and are currently in lockdown because of the escape of Delta. We will open up when we are in the range of 70-80% vaccinated from 12 upwards. It is currently 16 and upwards being vaccinated. We hit 60% single dose vaccinated 10 days ago, 70% single dose vaccinated 3 days ago and 80% by next monday. The second dose is of course in 3-4 weeks. We just got some Moderna and it has been approved and I suspect given the high rating of the other age brackets that they will roll out the vaccine to 12-15 year olds. School term finishes end of next week although kids are not in school. Then two weeks of holidays and then I believe the kids will go back to school for term 4. They can very quickly vaccinate the kids in school. Typically what schools do is send home a note for parents to sign. If they DON'T want their child vaccinated then they have to fill in the form.  If a parent forgets then too bad the kid is vaccinated. 

If people commit to the first dose then they will commit to the second. People cannot get an appointment at the moment and we are trying to secure swaps from other countries. We have vaccines on order for December but need it now. I am vaccinated with AZ of which we have plenty but there is a recommendation that under 18 get Pfizer or Moderna. I have three teens aged 16, 16 and 15. I was able to get a vaccine for one of the twins. We drove 2 hrs to get it and then 2hrs back. Again in 3 weeks time.  
Despite compliance on vaccination and not that many ratbag antivaxxers here, I still think when we open up that we will have qr codes to check into venues. The vaccines certificates are available at a government site where everyone has their own access. Most people have smart phones. I think there will also be a change in thinking.  We had over a year with no infections leaking into the community from quarantine of international travellers. We still had social distancing a bit and of course hand sanitiser is mandatory at all public places eg supermarkets, shops and offices. Last winter we hardly had any colds or flu. You can see the reporting here [https://info.flutracking.net/](https://info.flutracking.net/)  
Australia has come through this ok I feel. Other countries are NZ, Norway, Taiwan and I think Singapore. Taiwan and Singapore dealt with SARS 1.0 and there was i noticed a tendency with Asian students to use hand sanitiser repeatedly and wear masks if they had a respiratory illness.",,,,1630893166,{},hbrbosb,False,t3_piisj8,False,False,t1_hbr0m3o,/r/Coronavirus/comments/piisj8/us_hits_40_million_covid_cases_as_delta_variant/hbrbosb/,1630974194.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weekly, monthly, and annually they basically just count everyone who died. Those numbers are harder to fudge because of the way deaths are recorded and reported. 

What we’re particularly interested in here is “excess deaths.” Basically, relatively the same number of people die of heart attacks, cancer, and car accidents every year, adjusted for population. It’s kind of like clockwork. When we do something like introduce seatbelt laws we might see a dip, but all things being equal it’s a pretty steady cadence. 

Excess deaths during Covid are going to be largely attributable to Covid, since there’s not another major event that sets this past year and change apart. Excess deaths right now stand at about one million. This includes the 650k+ people who have directly died of Covid, those whose deaths were caused by an infection but for whom testing wasn’t done or wasn’t properly reported, and those who would have survived other medical conditions were not the facilities overburdened with Covid patients. 

Unfortunately those numbers tend to lag a bit, making them less useful than things like hospital bed utilization, but they’re pretty reliable.

&gt;	“It’s notable that **even though fewer than 50% of the people in the intervention villages wore masks in public places, we still saw a significant risk reduction in symptomatic COVID-19** in these communities, particularly in elderly, more vulnerable people.”

&gt;	“**Our study provides strong evidence that mask wearing can interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It also suggests that filtration efficiency is important.** This includes the fit of the mask as well as the materials from which it is made. **A cloth mask is certainly better than nothing. But now might be a good time to consider upgrading to a surgical mask.**”

Here are some points from the [study](https://www.poverty-action.org/study/impact-mask-distribution-and-promotion-mask-uptake-and-covid-19-bangladesh):

&gt;	Villages where **cloth masks were distributed experienced a 5 percent** reduction in symptoms, while villages where **surgical masks were distributed saw a reduction of 12 percent**.

&gt;	“**If mask-wearing rates were higher, we would expect to see an even bigger impact on transmission**,” Luby said. “But even at this level, we saw the largest impact on older people who are at greater risk of death from COVID-19.”

&gt;	**The materials used to make surgical masks have a higher filtration efficiency than the types of cloth typically used to make cloth masks**, but cloth masks can be sewn without specialized equipment and can have less leakage because they fit the face more closely.",,,,1630957287,{},hbufazi,False,t3_pj3n4j,False,False,t1_hbtujf6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pj3n4j/can_cloth_masks_really_stop_covid19_from_spreading/hbufazi/,1631031641.0,46,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infants and babies are young people, fwiw. And millions of kids are at increased risk: disabled, minority, asthma, taking immunosuppressive therapy, etc. 

Just saying death rates are lower than in adults isn’t much of a point. 

&gt; **Babies under age 1 might be at higher risk of severe illness with COVID-19 than older children. This is likely due to their immature immune systems and smaller airways, which make them more likely to develop breathing issues with respiratory virus infections.**

&gt; Newborns can become infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 during childbirth or by exposure to sick caregivers after delivery.

And also:

&gt; While all children are capable of getting the virus that causes COVID-19, they don't become sick as often as adults. Most children have mild symptoms or no symptoms.

&gt; According to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association, in the U.S. children represent about 13% of all COVID-19 cases. Research suggests that children younger than ages 10 to 14 are less likely to become infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 compared to people age 20 and older.

&gt; However, some children become severely ill with COVID-19. They might need to be hospitalized, treated in the intensive care unit or placed on a ventilator to help them breathe, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

&gt; In addition, children with underlying conditions, such as obesity, diabetes and asthma, might be at higher risk of serious illness with COVID-19. Children who have congenital heart disease, genetic conditions or conditions affecting the nervous system or metabolism also might be at higher risk of serious illness with COVID-19.

&gt; Research also suggests disproportionately higher rates of COVID-19 in Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black children than in non-Hispanic white children.

&gt; Some children continue to experience symptoms of COVID-19 after their initial recovery. Rarely, some children might also develop a serious condition that appears to be linked to COVID-19.

See also: 


&gt; Data from the CDC study indicate that some children may be at a higher risk for a serious case of COVID-19, needing medical care in a hospital:

&gt; • Those under age 2

&gt; • Black and Latino children, who can be affected by health disparities, leaving them disproportionately vulnerable to severe COVID-19 complications

&gt; • Children who were born prematurely

&gt; • Those living with obesity or chronic lung disease

…

&gt; In most cases, COVID-19 may be milder in young children than in adults, but parents and caregivers should understand that children can be infected with the coronavirus, can develop complications requiring hospitalization, and can transmit the virus to others.

&gt; In rare cases, children infected with the coronavirus can develop a serious lung infection and become very sick with COVID-19, and deaths have occurred. That’s why it is important to use precautions and prevent infection in children as well as adults.

There was no difference between the rates of pregnancy in the vaccine or placebo groups.** No one in the vaccine group had any trouble with their pregnancy over the course of the study. They also tested it on female rats and did not find any problems, either with fertility or pregnancy.

The Pfizer vaccine FDA report doesn't give a nice summary like this, but they do report 23 people became pregnant during the trial. They report 2 adverse events related to pregnancy, both in the placebo group.

Both companies say they will continue to monitor pregnant people. In general, there is no know reason why a vaccine would affect fertility. I don't believe any ever has before. While mRNA technology is new-ish, it's not so radically different that there would be any reason to believe fertility would be affected. On the other hand, there is growing evidence that covid-19 *does* affect fertility.""

If that's what it is then it's very reassuring that a strain which actually evades vaccine immunity isn't coming any time soon.

That being said, I live in Canada where our vaccine uptake had been very good, and despite that, epidemiological modelling suggests that provinces like Ontario (where I reside) could potentially max out their hospital capacity this fall. 83% of eligible residents have had at least one dose. Yet, between the delta variant being so infectious and virulent, vaccinated people still being partially vulnerable, unvaccinated children returning to school, and a small but stubborn minority (I expect around 10% in the end) who will refuse vaccination, there is plenty of opportunity for the virus to spread wildly and to make many people severely ill. 

Yes, most hospitalized patients will be the unvaccinated. But in the absence of other public health measures (e.g. masking, social distancing, vaccine passports), modelling suggests that even a 10% unvaccinated minority could fill up hospitals and lead to the kind of crises we saw in previous waves. I'm not trying to be a doomer, here. We're all sick of this shit and want to move past it, but the pandemic isn't done with us. Vaccines were a huge leap forward, but unless we're ready and willing to reimpose public health restrictions as they become necessary, we could still end up in the kind of situation that the US South is in right now. Hell, the province of Alberta is halfway there already. 

That's why I've come to support vaccine passports. Normal life gets to continue, business get to stay afloat, but we can curb the uncontrolled spread of the virus.

This may be more cautious than we need to be, but we have a close friend who is a peds ICU nurse and a couple other friends who work hospitals around the country.

China has had strict mask mandates that everyone follows. They also asked people not to travel and do mass celebrations during the spring festival this year. The funny thing is when they asked people not to do a lot of traveling during the spring festival, the government talked about virus spread and closing things down, and how a lack of social life is bad for mental health. My students told me this. 

I teach kids and adults, the adults talk about how they miss traveling, but they still go out to eat (some of my students log into class while out to eat), go to movies, go shopping. They wear masks 100% of the time. 

Also, people are mistaken because they attribute everything to lockdown. China locked down in specific areas, they would then launch testing of a million or more people within a couple of days and quarantine the sick. They have tight control of travelers and test and quarantine them. Everyone wears masks 100 of the time. Check out pics from their New Year celebration. 100s of people in the streets. All masked up.

It can go through a KN95, it can go through a surgical mask. But that’s not how the virus comes out of your mouth. It comes out riding droplets, aerosols and droplets.

&gt; “More kids are getting Covid right now than we ever thought imaginable,” Mr. Beshear said at a news conference on Monday.

It's Governor Beshear, and he should have imagined it.

&gt;The number of cases in children increased exponentially, up from about 38,000 cases the week ending July 22 to nearly 204,000 for the last full week in August.

That's a lot of sick kids. How could we not see this coming? In hindsight, it seems obvious it would happen. Schools spread disease among unvaccinated kids. It always happens.

Who shall we blame? Not Governor Beshear!

&gt; In August, Governor Beshear, a Democrat, rescinded an executive order mandating masks in schools after the state Supreme Court upheld laws passed by the Republican-led state Legislature limiting his power. 

No comment.

Many localities have reported about people not accepting delivery or cancelling orders, turning off their phones when military and volunteers try to contact them to deliver goods, and saying they just wanted to check if it actually worked.  
  
In order to ensure the efficiency of social distancing in HCM City, the military and police personnel have helped community-based COVID-prevention groups and volunteers shop and deliver food to people once a week from August 23.  
  
People can register and pay for their food through support teams at their residential zones.  
  
Needy and COVID-affected people will receive food and other essential goods.

Dr Đặng Thành, director of the provincial Centre for Disease Control, said that the new cases were from BuBia and Bù Dzách villages in Quảng Tín Ward, Đắk R’lấp District. They lived in the same house and had close contact to one another.  
  
The patients underwent rapid tests for SARS-CoV-2 with positive result on Sunday. Real-time RT-PCR tests on Monday confirmed the result.  
  
Vice Chairman of the district’s People's Committee Đỗ Thanh Cát said that the district decided to lock down the entire Quảng Tín Commune from 9pm on Sunday.  
  
The commune also set up 33 checkpoints, including two in Hồ Chí Minh Road and 31 inter-commune checkpoints.  
  
At two checkpoints that border neighbouring areas of the Đắk R’lấp District, authorities have tightened inspection on those who enter or get out of the area.  
  
On Sunday, a sixth grader tested positive for COVID-19 at a local boarding school on the first day of the new school year.  
  
He underwent two rapid tests at his school, with both results returning positive. His confirmatory test via the real-time RT-PCR method also came back positive.  
  
The student has been brought to local COVID-19 treatment hospital while all teachers and students of the boarding school were required to remain on campus for COVID-19 tests.  
  
Medical authorities have investigated his travel schedule and taken samples of people in Bubia Village, where the student resides, to promptly detect and separate infected people from the community.  
  
As many as 100 people had close contact with the patient.  
  
There have been 324 local infection cases in Đắk Nông since the fourth wave hit Việt Nam on April 27. Of those 166 have been given the-all-clear and 158 are still undergoing treatment.

Three things: **First**, the flu is seasonal.

They work similarly to how a pregnancy test works except you place a drop of blood on a device that contains a test strip with a purified covid protein (or proteins) attached and basically a band lights up if you have antibodies in your blood that recognize and bind to that protein. So you can make serology tests that test for antibodies against each of the covid proteins individually, or a test that tests for several covid proteins at once. You can even tell how strong your immune response was to the vaccine or virus by the intensity of the band that lights up! For example, I have seen a test (that screens for antibodies against the covid spike protein) which shows a weaker signal for someone who was previously infected by the virus than it does for individuals with a single Pfizer dose. But it shows just as strong of a signal for someone who was infected and then received one Pfizer dose as for individuals who have received two Pfizer doses. This indicates that people who have previously had the virus might only need ONE dose of Pfizer to get the same level of protection as people who receive two doses of Pfizer.

It was $13 an hour which isn't bad in my area, but there's a lot of jobs starting $15 an hour or more around too.  This was full-time with great hours Mon-Fri so I intentionally went with it instead of another job.  I was a seasonal worker and those employees kind of get the grunt shit to do during the day.  It was a physical job too, but I didn't mind it.  I'm in my last year of college now, but I got lost somewhere throughout that time so I'll have graduated in 6 years.   Working that job set me up with a great routine for the summer and now I've been easily translating that towards getting my school work completed on time.  There was also a full-time position opening and I was doing well there so I was in a good spot to get the job if I wanted it.  The pay for that starts at $21 and that's without needing a college degree.

It could just be me, but there was value gained from working those types of jobs.  You can also meet many more types of people and see their different perspectives of life.

While the article is an Irish paper, the same statement is true everywhere. Those who don't want to get vaccines for ideological reasons will not get them based on the number or quality of messages put out.

There are elements from Irish culture that have been exported to the US due to the huge number of people from Ireland who have moved to the US since the middle of the 19th century. Similarly English occupation and colonisation of Ireland instilled by force a number of the same values that said things did in the US, which is very heavily based upon what those values were in the 18th and 19th centuries.

However Irish culture has continued to evolve and the rift is very clear. So too has English culture for that matter. So while I can guess that true mandatory vaccination will not happen in either the UK or in Ireland, I can't say that with the same certainty I could in the US so I only specified the US in the last sentence.

 I have put my life on serious lockdown since march of 2020. I am vaccinated, wear a mask, and only go out if necessary. I live with high risk people. Even vaccinated, I could kill people in my home/care. I want to see my family and friends,  I want to live life outside this bullshit, all of it.  So I know how fucking shitty it is. I don't expect everyone to have to live like me, just a little help protecting the people who did their part but are still at risk would go a mile in my eyes.

We need to be harder on these people, way harder. I honestly hate them at this point, and they 100% aren't the people I hope you protect by wearing a mask. They made their bed and deserve to lay in it. The people I care about are the young children,  being forced into schools without being eligible for the vaccine, where they can't even be guaranteed other kids will be wearing a mask. The elderly, immunocompromised people, and those who care for them also still have to be extra cautious. Delta is bad news, who knows what the next variant will bring. Don't allow your body to be the petri dish that figures it out the hard way.

I don't recommend living like a hermit,  but exercise some caution. Wear a mask. Keep your distance when you can. Get the booster when it's available to you.  If you have groups you normally hangout with who use the above guidelines,  you can relax a little more. 

That way we can ALL get back to normal, not just the lucky people who don't have to care as much.

While your point is good, your use of ""many"" is probably stretching it a bit. The site you posted is tedious to go through state-by-state, so I found some other sources.

4 states and DC allow minors of varying ages to get the COVID vaccine without parental consent (Alabama, age 14+; Oregon, age 15+; Rhode Island, age 16+; and South Carolina, age 16+; DC, age 11+). A few other states allow providers the option to waive parental consent.

With rabies, the virus slowly travels up your nerves from where you received the bite until it reaches your brain. The amount of time it takes for this can be weeks (for bites close to your brain) or years (for bites far from your brain).

So long as you get the vaccine before it reaches your brain, you will be fine and your body will be able to kill off the virus.

 This virus is bad, but nowhere near bad enough to threaten humanity's entire existence.  Reinfection is not very common, and when it does happen it's usually less severe the 2nd time.  

And although there's been a lot of worry about breakthrough infections, the reality is that the vaccines work extremely well, and we are still fairly early in the vaccination campaign (considering kids can't get the shots yet).  If we look at the 8 countries with over 70% of their population fully vaxxed (UAE, Portugal, Qatar, Spain, Singapore, Denmark, Chile and Uruguay), every single one of these countries has low numbers of new cases, and every single one has a decreasing rate of daily new cases (with the exception of Singapore, which has increasing cases, but still only 32 new cases per 1 million people, which is tiny).",,,,1630887381,{},hbqzwji,False,t3_pikb0x,False,False,t1_hbqwdn5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pikb0x/india_may_be_reaching_endemicity_after_emerging/hbqzwji/,1630968020.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; ""We're in a very dangerous place, given the level of our surge,"" says Dr. Bruce Siegel, president of America's Essential Hospitals, a trade group that represents **hundreds of public hospitals**.

&gt; ""We are right on the edge of entering **crisis standards of care**.

Do you know what ""crisis standards of care"" means?

&gt; For example, certain patients deemed less likely to survive may not get a bed in the intensive care unit. Nurses may be asked to treat many more patients than is normally considered safe. Patients may have to be discharged from the hospital before they would normally go home, and some patients who would usually be admitted for hospital care might have to be denied.

Does this apply to all hospitals? Of course not. So far, only some places are affected but the problem is growing. Arizona:

&gt; Arizona had to activate its plan earlier in the pandemic

Idaho:

&gt; ""It's worse than ever, with — at this point — seemingly no end in sight,"" says Krell, who helps run an ICU in eastern Idaho. ""So by no means are we delivering a usual and customary standard of care.""

Alabama:

&gt; Republican Gov. Kay Ivey declared a state of emergency last month because of the surge in serious COVID-19 cases. 

New Mexico:

&gt; In New Mexico, the surge has led to ICU waiting lists and state health officials have warned they might have to employ crisis standards of care soon if the trajectory of infections simply stays the same, let alone rises.

and more:

&gt; According to the model, ICU capacity will be under ""extreme stress"" in states like Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Hawaii, Georgia, Delaware and Wisconsin.

So you see, the title was not at all misleading. It refers to actual facts that are documented in the article.
