on the results page (edit 5) of that study it refers to exclusions. the ones who became severe from the ivermectin group were removed from the calculation, so that will drastically impact your results.

i guess you didn't want us to notice that this research happened in june through august of 2020 in one hospital, right?

it's also highly relevant the number of male and female participants was very inequal between the groups and that over 10% of each group was ""lost to follow up""

it may be relevant the ivermectin wasn't even in mg/kg it was in a set dosage

""serious adverse events"" were 2 from the Ivermectin group and zero  from placebo

""other adverse events"" were 7 from ivermectin and zero from placebo

oh jesus it says ""we could not assess viral clearance directly"" lol so the whole thing is essentially bs interview based. 

ooh, they explain the standard of care which are definitely not used in the US. i see why the mild people improved under ivermectin, since the placebo group was getting such crappy care. if this study was repeated in the US you wouldn't see the kitchen sink thrown at them.

if i wanted to be snide i'd mention the principal investigator still uses yahoo email.

The approval was as follows:

-65+ or long-term care residents: SHOULD get a booster after 6mo

-50-64 with underlying health conditions: SHOULD get a booster

-18-49 with underlying health conditions: MAY get a booster if they want to

-18-64 working jobs that puts them at high risk of exposure: MAY get a booster

""Underlying health conditions"" is extraordinarily broad; 74% of the adult population qualifies on BMI alone, then there's also high blood pressure, current/former smoker, substance use, asthma, diabetes..... long list.

&gt;Bad side effects have not been ruled out, yet.  
&gt;  
&gt;**At this resolution**, all the currently existing main vaccines have zero side effects.

It’s been a while since I’ve studied statistics myself, but I think they’re saying something roughly like:

The studies of the safety of the various COVID-19 vaccines had tens of thousands of participants. But if such studies had only included as many participants as the Merck study of *Molnupiravir* (a couple thousand), what side-effects we ***do*** now know about for the vaccines would not have been detectable with a level of confidence sufficient to satisfy [mediandude](/u/mediandude), which apparently relates to 3 sigma (three standard deviations). A hypothetical vaccine safety study of that small size would not have let us assert that there’s a less than 0.003 chance (roughly 1/300) that the differences between the experimental group and the control group were due to chance.

Or if he suits up and wears an N95 when he sees anyone, he might be safe. If he lives in a town or city where there are frequent days when there are no new cases, he may be safe. 

In my area at least, most of the unvaccinated people, if they go out and are around other people, are getting infected now that the delta variant is here. 

Why take a chance? 

The only fact that makes it at all ok would be that babies and toddlers usually get very mild cases. But not always.

What I would do? Just say no. I don't like to mess around with diseases that can kill people with the ease that Covid kills. 700,000 dead now in this country.

&gt; “Side-effects nearly always occur within a couple of weeks of a person being vaccinated,” says John Grabenstein, director of scientific communication for the Immunization Action Coalition. He adds that the longest time before a side effect appeared for any type of shot has been six weeks.

&gt; A key reason for this limited window of side effects is the short time all vaccines stay in the body, says Onyema Ogbuagu, an infectious diseases specialist at Yale Medicine and a principal investigator of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine trial.

&gt; The vaccines subsequently get to work stimulating the immune system so it can memorize the virus’s blueprint and mount a quick response if it encounters the real thing later. “This process is completed within about six weeks,” says Inci Yildirim, a vaccinologist and pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Yale Medicine. That’s why serious adverse effects that might be triggered by the process emerge within this time frame, after which everything is put on a shelf in the body’s library of known pathogens, Yildirim says.

&gt; So, no vaccine has caused chronic conditions to emerge years or decades later, says Robert Jacobson, medical director of the population health science program at the Mayo Clinic. “Study after study have looked for this with all sorts of vaccines, and have not found it to be the case.”",,,,1633140573,{},hf1sdmu,False,t3_pzcz6o,False,False,t1_hf1mu44,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pzcz6o/live_california_to_require_public_school_students/hf1sdmu/,1633275577.0,38,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Last week Pfizer presented it's data on 5-11 year olds. From there the following still needs to happen before emergency use authorization is granted:

1. FDA needs to review the data and reconvenes the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). This is next scheduled for October 14th (though they are likely to discuss Moderna boosters in this meeting as opposed to Pfizer EUA for 5-11 year olds).
2. VRBPAC will then advise the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on whether or not the vaccine should receive Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
3. FDA chooses to give EUA (or not)
4. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) will reconvene the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to present and review the data from VRBPAC.
5. ACIP then advises the CDC on whether or not the vaccine should be recommended. 
6. CDC then recommends the vaccine (or not)
7. Data is collected on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in 5-11 year olds. 
8. After a period of time (generally one year) Pfizer requests full authorization and a similar process happens prior to the vaccine being fully authorized.

If I were a betting man, I would say that this will not happen prior to the start of the 2022 school year. Authorization is likely to be granted late 2022 for 5-11 year olds (assuming the data looks good).",,,,1633157981,{},hf2js6i,False,t3_pzcz6o,False,True,t1_hf1rq1w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pzcz6o/live_california_to_require_public_school_students/hf2js6i/,1633290528.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Viruses are essentially free floating RNA or DNA.      There is no such thing as a viral organism.  In contrast, bacteria and parasites are much more complex - they have cells!

Medicine that effectively kills parasites, for example heart worm lice or pin worms, attacks parasite cells and kills the whole parasite.  If that medicine attacked human cells to any significant degree it would kill the human too!  

The upshot is there is nothing for the parasite medication to disrupt and kill if a human has no parasites.  COVID19 is not fundamentally changing human cells into heart worm, lice, pinworm, etc cells.  By the way, this is also why antibiotics don’t work on viruses.  

Because viruses do not turn human cells into parasite cells, there is no mechanism for a anti-parasite medication that specifically attacks parasite cells to instead attack viral infected human cells.  

In contrast - antivirals go after the virus itself (which is difficult since viruses are mostly just DNA or RNA and us humans also have DNA and RNA) or viral infected human cells (also very difficult to target specific human cells and as an aside why cancer medications are usually very toxic).  This is much more difficult!  It’s why there are so few antiviral medications and those that we do have don’t work across virus types.

For example, the current vaccines were far less effective in preventing infection with the Delta variant, not because the vaccine doesn't produce an immune response specific to Delta, but because of how mutations on Delta make it easier for the virus to infect cells in the first place, subsequently making it more likely to replicate and overwhelm an immune response. So then, epidemiologically, the effectiveness of the vaccine is then affected by the prevalence of Delta relative to other strains, as well as the case counts relative to the population.

A big part of whether vaccines are effective is the adoption ratio, because vaccines are not intended to work on an individual level, but to slow down spread in the overall population.

[],,helembad,,,[],,,,text,t2_s0xb5,False,False,,"&gt;The seasonality argument is weak, given then we’ve seen it spread so rapidly this past summer. A lot of papers on seasonality were written 1Q 2021

Seasonality doesn't mean a virus doesn't spread in summer, just means it spreads more easily in winter. Obviously talking about areas where that's the seasonality. I don't see why covid wouldn't be just as seasonal as literally any other respiratory virus out there, unless it spreads through thoughts.

And by the way, Spain had a summer peak in 2020.

&gt;If it were simply seasonality then why is the virus going gangbusters in India where there aren’t cold winters? 

Because seasonality in India is not the same as in Europe - India still has seasonal flu, you know. Additionally, Delta emerged around that time. 

&gt;SF Bay Area rates are very low. other temperate regions with low vaccination right now have high rates.

It was the case last fall though. Cases in, say, New Jersey started having high rates far earlier than SF.

&gt;What low-vaccination region right now has low spread, sans NPIs?

Poland, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Pakistan, Iran, parts of the Balkans, pretty much the entire Latin America...

&gt;So somehow vaccines reduce risk of infection and spread in individuals but… don’t at a population level?

No, again, you're not reading. They do reduce it, just not enough to make a difference in *trends*, as multiple examples have now shown. Vaccines did massively reduce hospitalisations in the UK, but cases still went up a lot.

&gt;Also, Madrid got hit hard in the winter, what are you talking about?! I’m literally looking at the JHU data and Madrid got slammed in Jan-Mar. 

Madrid got a peak in Jan due to the Alpha variant, and since then they had several quiet months despite the horeca being mostly open. Other regions with similar high natural immunity and tougher restrictions had higher peaks. In Italy, Lombardy and Piedmont had a very bad third wave in March-April while cases in Liguria which is literally next to them stayed flat for the whole time - which means they escaped a third lockdown while Lombardy and Piedmont had to shut down shops and schools for one month straight. The point is that different regions, even geographically close, have different timings and case rates regardless of vaccines. There doesn't need to be ""an explanation"" and using vaccines as one is a selection bias.

&gt;As far as MS, err…it’s called natural immunity. Enough people get sick and… well… it stops spreading after a while. Immunization, hard mode!

Don't just randomly browse all sorts of garbage in there. And if you have a friend that posts some crazy antivaxx crap or something like that, just let it pass. You don't have to delete them from your friend list (because they might be otherwise good friends), just ignore such posts.

The buses were prepared on the night of September 30 after the city Department of Sports noticed increased traffic due to people leaving HCM City on their motorbikes.  
  
The buses with a capacity of 40 to 80 seats will be located near checkpoints to relieve congestion and ensure safety.  
  
Of the 60 buses allocated near the checkpoint on National Highway No 1, the section through Bùi Thanh Khiết Intersection in Bình Chánh District, 23 buses are being used to transport more than 800 people to eight Mekong Delta provinces.  
  
Most of the people were going to Sóc Trăng on six buses, followed by Kiên Giang Province with five buses, An Giang with three buses, Bạc Liêu with three buses and the remaining buses to Vĩnh Long, Cà Mau, Trà Vinh, Sóc Trăng and Tiền Giang provinces.  
  
At the checkpoint at Mỹ Thuận Bridge, the gateway to Vĩnh Long Province, authorities recorded 1,000 people riding motorbikes to their hometowns. Among them, over 100 people were sent to isolation areas while the rest continued their journey.  
  
Similarly, on October 1, Trà Vinh Province welcomed 200 people, Sóc Trăng 500 people and Cần Thơ over 100 people. All of them filled in medical declarations and were taken to isolation facilities.  
  
Those who have received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine or have a certificate showing recovery within the last six months will quarantine for seven days, while unvaccinated people and people who have had only one vaccine dose will isolate for 14 days.   
  
Đồng Tháp recently welcomed more than 400 people after they tested negative with COVID-19. Four  cases suspected of having COVID-19 were sent for isolation in Tháp Mười District.  
  
Since medical and isolation capacity is limited in some Mekong Delta provinces, people from Long An, HCM City, Đồng Nai and Bình Dương have been asked not to travel to these localities by motorbike after September 30. Instead, authorities will organise pick-ups for special cases.  
  
Minister of Transport Nguyễn Văn Thể on October 1 asked HCM City, Bình Dương, Đồng Nai and Long An to fully prepare trucks, buses and drivers to promptly support people in need.

Just 13 of the new cases were imported.  
  
The three hotspots, HCM City, Bình Dương and Đồng Nai, all in the southern region, continued to lead the country with new daily infections, 2,723, 1,517, and 509 respectively, but these are down by hundreds compared to yesterday's figures.  
  
The remaining new cases were found in An Giang (139), Long An (107), Kiên Giang (77), Đắk Lắk (59), Bình Thuận (47), Hà Nam (42), Khánh Hòa (36), Tiền Giang (36), Cần Thơ (23), Tây Ninh (20), Ninh Thuận (16), Quảng Bình (15), Hà Nội (14), Quảng Trị (13), Quảng Ngãi (12), Nghệ An (10), Đắk Nông (7), Bắc Giang (6), Đồng Tháp (6), Hậu Giang (5), Phú Thọ (5), Bình Định (5), Vĩnh Long (4), Cà Mau (3), Bạc Liêu (3), Bà Rịa - Vũng Tàu (3), Phú Yên (2), Nam Định (2), Bình Phước (2), Quảng Ninh (2), Hưng Yên (1), Trà Vinh (1), Đà Nẵng (1), Hải Dương (1), Lâm Đồng (1), Gia Lai (1), and Ninh Bình (1).  
  
The cluster at Việt Đức Hospital in Hà Nội has grown to 28, including 11 Hà Nội residents. 7,260 samples have been taken for testing, while the health ministry has asked Hà Nội People's Committee to arrange quarantine facilities for relatives of patients treated at the hospital and for the hospital's medical workers.  
  
The latest caseload brings Việt Nam's total number of infections to 803,202, with 798,626 the result of the fourth wave of infections that swept the country since late April.  
  
The country's seven-day average of daily confirmed new cases is down by 600 cases to 8,065 compared to yesterday.  
  
Việt Nam also logged a new record of number of patients given the all-clear on Saturday, with 28,857 recoveries, higher than the previous record seen yesterday, bringing the country's total recoveries to 664,938.  
  
6,337 patients are in serious condition, according to the health ministry's report, with 805 requiring invasive ventilation and 25 on life support (ECMO).  
  
A total of 164 COVID-19 deaths were recorded on Saturday, bringing the seven-day average to 165. Việt Nam has had 19,601 COVID-19 fatalities to date, or 2.5 per cent of the total infections.  
  
760,643 doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered on Friday, putting the total administered shots in Việt Nam to more than 43.6 million. 10.1 million people have received two doses of vaccines. — VNS",,,,1633184729,{},hf3nf2s,True,t3_pzw4yi,False,False,t3_pzw4yi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pzw4yi/việt_nam_records_lowest_daily_covid19_increase_in/hf3nf2s/,1633311082.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even in non-pandemic times, that would significantly raise her chances of getting sick from a wide variety of crud, and that's just negligence by adults who should know better.

In the before times, it was way less stupid and dire than you're making it out to be. It has to be the same kid (or a small pool of kids) doing the deed since only the most responsible students in a class get that role. Otherwise you wouldn't have the trust and accountability needed.

Look at it this way: the sick kids are already in the same classrooms as the hall monitors. If it is something communicable, they're already spreading whatever junk they have to all their classmates in that room. This nurse escort situation isn't an everyday occurrence. While there might be a stomach bug or flu going around, most of the time the nurse escort is for things like headaches, sprained ankles, scraped knees, tummy aches, asthma attacks, allergies, and nosebleeds - real run of the mill stuff. The rest of the time, the HM doesn't do anything medical. At the end of the day the HMs help students get on the right buses to go home. Between classes, HMs make sure kids aren't running in the halls or overtly bullying people. Maybe they have to go fetch some papers or other materials for the teacher mid-lesson. Really, nothing super crazy.

The system only breaks down when there's an abnormally contagious virus ravaging the whole planet. Then shit gets real fucky everywhere.

When everything went into lockdown, they immediately implemented a virtual schooling program for everyone. And they knew it wasn't going to work very well, so they didn't put much pressure on anyone about it. No tests, grading was very lenient.

When the lockdown ended and people started pushing to have kids go back into school, they handled it very carefully. Made virtual learning a continuing option, and required masks and distancing for everyone entering the building. No one could enter the building without good reason -- parents couldn't even go into the office unless their business couldn't be handled another way.

Whenever they've found out about someone having entered the school while infected, they immediately take care of it. Extra cleaning in the areas they went in, and everyone who has kids there gets an e-mail letting them know it happened. Anyone who might have had contact with that person gets an extra e-mail telling them what to do -- the first message points this out, saying that if you didn't get the second one you should be okay.

The point is full disclosure. They don't downplay it, or try to hide cases. If anyone shows up without a mask, they get handed a disposable one to use. If they refuse to wear it, they get escorted out. And if they *keep* refusing to wear masks, they get banned from the property.

You don't start with completely restricted speech, and then we grant you what you're allowed to say. You're granted total free speech, inalienable rights, and then if that is to be infringed upon, it's now the government's job to demonstrate why it should be infringed, and then a majority of people must agree on a vote. This compared to most other countries, where you are only granted rights because we ""the leader"" can take them because we gave them. That's the difference. So are there examples where your rights and/or freedoms are infringed upon?  Yes. Like yelling fire in a crowded room. But it has to be the most extreme of examples. So while I absolutely think you should be vaccinated, something that doesn't give absolute immunity indefinitely like a smallpox or polio vaccine, just doesn't seem to meet the threshold of being so beneficial or necessary to the continuing of life, to become an infringement of rights. Now that is just my opinion, which means nothing, but it would have to go to a vote and be brought about as a legal change. That's the system that was started, and it was started so that just because the thing now makes sense, getting vaccinated for example, doesn't mean the mechanism used to enforce that won't be abused in the future. So this is a fear of mechanism, not the thing being used. Because of the system we have, once you give up that infringement of rights, it doesn't go back. They used loopholes to get us into military conflicts because it made sense at the time to avoid Congress and just do it, for safety. And now look how that has been abused and how much money and how many lives we have lost by the mechanism.  But having this fear instantly makes you anti vax. So that's why I was trying to be expressly clear that what I said has nothing to do with vaccinations, only used it now as an example in good faith that I won't be somehow misconstrued as being anti vax, but has to do with my understanding of the why behind it. There's some level of people who just want to pile on insults and that's great. But the people who really want to understand why, so we can get people to actually.get vaccinated, have to look at that fundamental difference on the structure of how rights work because of our Constitution here vs other places, and the effects that will probably have on attitudes around freedom, rights, etc.",,,,1633208438,{},hf55t6b,False,t3_pzkn90,False,True,t1_hf53vcs,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pzkn90/too_bad_antivaxxers_california_will_mandate_covid/hf55t6b/,1633337964.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Listen. What “a top immunologist in your country” chooses to do with a combination of drugs — **of which neither have been proven to be safe or effective in treating viral infections like covid-19**, btw — is about as useful as a spilled cup of coffee. 

And Doxycycline is an *antibiotic* that treats bacterial infections and certain parasites.

And, to date, low doses of Ivermectin have shown near-zero efficacy against viruses. 

And without knowing the actual “protocol,” who knows what else that doctor is treating patients with (like corticosteroids, which *do* work).

Yes.

Merk lost hundreds of millions of dollars spent on research and development that had to be written off.

That's not how profit works.  That's not how any of this works, but I'll explain profit to you...

Profit is made when you spend less making something than the price you get for selling it.  The greater the difference between the two, the more profit you get.  Corporations, being profit driven, and conspiracies, also being profit driven, would suggest that they would want to take that first part ""spend less making something"" and go with the cheap horsey paste, which again, already exists and has shipped all around the world.

That is, of course, unless that horsey paste doesn't work, and guess what?

This is a convenient number, because it is the age group that is most likely to develop myocarditis as a result of covid, but not the most likely to develop it as a result of vaccination.   
  
The proportion of covid cases that resulted in myocarditis in that most vulnerable population was 450 per million. The most vulnerable population from vaccination, the 18-24 age range, reported developing myocarditis at a rate of 263 per million following a second dose of Moderna. That is not even double, and it is an overestimate of the actual ratio.

Additionally, the rest of thr country has been watching with incredulity as the AB government relaxed distancing and masking measures too early, reduced testing and contact tracing, and lifted isolation requirements for those who tested positive.

However, in limited, exceptional situations where a patient received the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine but is unable to complete the series with either the same or different mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (e.g., due to contraindication), a single dose of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine may be considered at a minimum interval of 28 days from the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose. See the Contraindications and Precautions section for additional information on use of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and additional precautions in people with a contraindication to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Patients who receive Janssen COVID-19 vaccine after a dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine should be considered to have received a valid, single-dose Janssen vaccination—not a mixed vaccination series—and are considered fully vaccinated against COVID-19 ≥2 weeks after receipt of the single dose of the Janssen vaccine.

Trying to understand which measure is effective is pointless because we already know their effectiveness. Each of the measures in isolation provide a non-zero, if not very high, increase in protection. It makes sense to stack the different measures to provide even more protection.

Eradicating, in the context you provided, relates to the severity of the infection. If they're already infected it doesn't matter in the larger scope of things because it didn't reduce the chance the infection. Ivermectin is being used as a response to COVID-19, not as a prophylactic.

COVID vaccines might even be like the Influenza vaccine, which needs to be renewed annually.

The Salk polio vaccine, for one, is a 4 dose series with 3 doses several months apart and a booster several years out.

Booster doses 6 months out can create a more robust immune response and a longer lasting immunity in many vaccines.

Be glad this isn't like the Smallpox vaccine, where they jab you with a live virus called Vaccinia (which is not the original cowpox based vaccine from the 1790s -- it is more closely related to horsepox). It is related to the Smallpox virus enough that there is sufficient immune protection, but it doesn't cause Smallpox. However, it is a live virus that can make you sick and leave scars.

To be fully protected, one would need a smallpox vaccine every several years.

All incidents were mild and cleared within several days.  In fact in the UK it was only approved for a single dose for 12-17 age group.  The reason I consider it a non-issue is that the risk of a more severe myocarditis is 6x that from covid.  At this point it seems that its either endemic like the cold/flu or at least we will all be exposed to it at some point so it will reduce risk.  

I can see why people are more hesitant with their kids as it hasnt been all that bad for kids, so to take any risk may seem unneccesary if you dont weigh the value of increased protection of everyone else.  With adults the risk reward of dying/long covid makes the risk worth the reward with very little room for debate even without considering the well-being of everyone.

I'm all for requiring these for things like school/workplaces but my point is that there are some valid concerns and if someone is reasonable knowing the facts may be helpful in a discussion with them and bring them over to the 5g chipped side..",,,,1633140097,{},hf1rgnh,False,t3_pzcz6o,False,False,t1_hf1echi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pzcz6o/live_california_to_require_public_school_students/hf1rgnh/,1633275062.0,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

What? We **did** observe seasonality in covid just as much as any other respiratory virus out there. *Especially* in Europe!

&gt;you have several high-vaccination regions where spread is relatively low. 

You also have several low-vaccination regions where spread is relatively low, and several high-vaccination regions where spread is relatively high.

&gt;you have several high-vaccination regions where spread is relatively low. 

Seasonality, and just the fact that waves often come and go and have different timings across different regions with no apparent driver. Why did Manitoba and Ontario had their peaks more than one month apart in spring? Why did cases in Madrid stay low across most of last winter despite bars and restaurants being open, only to then explode again in April and then again in summer? Why are cases falling in Alabama and Mississippi while they're increasing in Minnesota even though Minnesota's vaccination rate is much higher?

And by the way - last year SF had its peak in December and only started increasing by early November.

Your argument is that vaccination isn’t the reason. That’s an odd argument given that most places that have high vaccination rates are having smaller waves than places with lower vaccination rates. Its also odd given that we know that vaccines lower risk of contracting or spreading disease. 

You could argue that there is unexplained heterogeneity in my model (perhaps seasonality that we haven’t yet observed in the virus, but that’s only likely partly explanatory here, since several regions in the US and Canada can serve as proxies here.)

they say in one para that ""dominator (total vaccines administered over a two-month period in Ottawa) used to calculate the incidence rate of myocarditis in the pre-print study was approximately 25 orders of magnitude off the correct figure.""

1. they meant ""denominator""

2. 25 ""orders of magnitude"" means 10e+25 difference...  I find it hard tp believe they were wrong by 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 and nobody noticed..

later in the report they say ""where the denominator was incorrect by a magnitude of roughly 25.""   which seems more realistic..

There are always going to be idiots who refuse to listen to the science on issues. Back when I was a child, the wee parents who refused to allow their kids to be vaccinated against polio. My mom was weak kneed with relief when we could be vaccinated.

Gun violence is a rarer incident in schools and prepping for a school shooting doesn’t help you much to prepare for other issues you might encounter in life. Most adult gun violence victims die in interpersonal conflicts, not mass shooting. Preparing for a mass shooting isn’t as useful  as learning about managing those interpersonal conflicts. 

For what it’s worth, I’m a criminologist who studies violence in schools. The harm of school shooting drills far outweighs their usefulness.

Not at all. “Wane” means fade, not disappear. 

And that just looks at onward transmission, not overall efficacy, effectiveness, infection, illness, hospitalization, or death. That said, we already know immunity (natural and vaccine) wanes over time. And we all know Delta is way more transmissible than Alpha in general, fwiw. 

It’s complicated. ;)

Additionally, from the link: 

&gt; **The estimated effect of contact vaccination status does not reflect overall vaccine effectiveness.**

… 

&gt; Vaccination reduces transmission of Delta, but by less than the Alpha variant. The impact of vaccination decreased over time. **Factors other than PCR-measured viral load are important in vaccine-associated transmission reductions**. Booster vaccinations may help control transmission together with preventing infections.

…

&gt; However, **as expected, PCR-positivity was highest in unvaccinated contacts (34,137/70,370(49%)), followed by those partially vaccinated with ChAdOx1, (3,401/10,325(33%)) and BNT162b2 (5,809/18,017(32%)); those fully vaccinated with ChAdOx1 (6,163/27,343(23%)) and BNT162b2 (2,288/13,109(17%)) had the lowest rates.**

…

&gt; The Delta variant was associated with increased onward transmission vs. Alpha for symptomatic index cases (aOR=1.30[1.10-1.54]) and to a greater extent for asymptomatic index cases (aOR=2.14[1.75-2.60]). Post-second dose vaccine-associated reductions on onward transmission were also attenuated with Delta, for both BNT162b2 by 1.9-fold (aOR=1.93[1.25-2.99]) and ChAdOx1 by 1.7-fold (aOR=1.71[1.01-2.90]). **This resulted in two BNT162b2 doses reducing onward transmission of Delta by a greater extent than ChAdOx1 (aOR=0.35[0.26-0.48] vs aOR=0.64[0.57-0.72], respectively, heterogeneity p&lt;0.001).**

They all track infections and deaths and its trivial to set up their databases to track reinfection deaths.

But I'm going to assume you're discussing in good faith here, although most who are pushing ivermectin are actively bad beans who are trying to cause people's deaths.

Studies of this form are excellent, but they're also only going to take you on tiny steps.  We have seen studies ""in vitro"" (on a glass slide) where they injected hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and any of a dozen other random drugs into cells that had sars-cov-2 present and saw that the virus didn't spread as well.  This gave us hope that these might work.

This is an entirely different approach: they did a study ""in silico"" (on a computer) where they modeled how ivermectin might work and came up with some answers.  This gives understanding of how the mechanism might work, if the drug were effective.

Both of these are excellent tools for research for a number of reasons.  But they cannot tell you if the drug actually works.  For that you have to go to the real world, and the way you do that is with a randomized controlled trial (RCT).  You take a set of people, randomly split them into two groups, treat one group with the drug and another with the control (a placebo).  We've done this with vaccines, which is how we know they prevent 94% of (wildtype) COVID infections.  But when it comes to drugs we do the same trials and they have never (with a few exceptions) shown the drugs to work beyond a reasonable doubt.  Trials of this form are expensive, and it's a massive problem that nobody wants to pay to run good ones, and this leaves uncertainty because it's absolutely possible ivermectin is helpful (nowhere near the 100x reduction in death that vaccines provide, but certainly something in the 1-1.5x range is possible or even likely).  We just don't know beyond a reasonable doubt.

The real problem isn't ivermectin, or hydroxychloroquine, obviously.  They're just inanimate drugs.  The problem is that bad actors use the vague possibility that these drugs might slightly reduce death to actively encourage people to get infected.  This directly causes many to die, which in another era might be called murder or possibly war.  There is therefore backlash against those bad actors, which in this case manifests as you getting downvoted.

Firstly: Singapore had virtually no spread of the virus. None. Therefore nobody has been exposed and a number of folks will be infected when exposed. That's normal and expected to a degree. European countries by comparison had more endemic spread and people who had both been infected and vaccinated are going to put up a stronger defense. Natural immunity is strong, vaccinated immunity is strong. Both together is strongest.

Cases are falling in more than just Western Europe: they're falling in virtually all regions with high rates of vaccination. My county in California has an R-eff under 1 as well after a smallish wave.

We knew that people were going to get it after being vaccinated. None of this is surprising. It's a question of whether or not it leads to bad outcomes. So far we're not seeing it in most places with high rates of vaccination.

The available data on myocarditis with actual COVID seems to suggest that it's most likely with individuals in their 50s, whereas with the vaccine it seems to more affect younger people. It could be that with the actual virus younger and healthier people are able to squash the infection so that the spike protein isn't expressed in as much quantity as in older individuals but conversely because they are young and healthy their cells crank out more spike protein in response to mRNA vaccines. I think that's the best theory so far on why we see more cases of pericarditis/myocarditis with younger individuals than older ones. Presumably they can address this just by adjusting the dosing and I believe for the 5-12 range they're dropping the dose down considerably. But it'd be nice to get some actual data for 12-17 to see if maybe we should adjust their dosing as well. 

I actually think that in very young people &lt;5 they're going to have a tough time getting the vaccine approved because there are so few cases of children actually getting sick enough to require hospitalization.

If it's just one smoldering cigarette butt, the fire may take long enough to get going and be confined narrowly enough that even unsophisticated efforts (nonspecific immune system, latent antibodies from months-old vaccination or previous infection) can put it out. 

We do sometimes also hear of terrible fires that start in tinder-dry forests from just one tiny spark, or that same cigarette butt. The analog would be an immunocompromised or otherwise highly susceptible person for whom any level of exposure is more dangerous. 

Infections generally have a non-zero ""threshold"" load below which you don't contract the disease, even though you were exposed to live pathogen. The threshold could be lower or higher depending on the specific organism--measles is much more efficient at gaining a foothold, for instance.

The physical laws are the same.  Human biology hasn’t changed.  We *do* have a lot to learn, but understanding things in the context of what we know about other viruses, etc. absolutely makes sense.

&gt;”Aladdin” isn’t planning another show until Oct. 12. On Tuesday, it held its first performance since Broadway was forced to close in March 2020. The show was canceled on Wednesday because of several positive coronavirus tests, but was able to resume Thursday at the New Amsterdam Theater — for what turned out to be just one night.

&gt;An epidemiologist working with the production said the cases were among vaccinated people, and that the 12-day pause was needed to allow them to recover and avoid further spread of the virus.

&gt;Disney said in a statement that it was refunding purchased tickets.

&gt;All Broadway companies — cast and crew — are required to be fully vaccinated, as are all Broadway audiences. When breakthrough cases occur, some productions have been able to keep going by using understudies. For example, “Waitress” had a positive test in its cast before its first performance, but was able to use testing to determine that the rest of the cast was negative, allowing the performance to proceed with an understudy.

&gt;The Broadway League announced on Friday an extension of their vaccine and masking requirements through the end of the year, which will apply in all 41 Broadway theaters. Patrons over the age of 12 must be vaccinated, testing is required for those 12 and under, and all attendees must be masked.

&gt;”Aladdin” had been dealing with coronavirus complications in the run-up to its reopening performance. The raucous first night performance, with an audience that included Kristin Chenoweth and the show’s composer, Alan Menken, and librettist, Chad Beguelin, featured three understudies. The crowd didn’t seem to mind — “Friend Like Me,” the Genie’s big production number, brought the audience to its feet. Michael James Scott, the actor playing the Genie, had stood to the side of the stage, breathless, before shouting to the audience, by way of explanation, “18 months, people! 18 months!”

&gt;But summer camps in less-vaccinated Southern states that failed to mandate shots for staff members or require indoor masking remained vulnerable to outbreaks, the C.D.C. said.

&gt;Those findings were contained in two studies released on Friday — one focusing on nine heavily vaccinated sleep-away camps across the United States, and the other on outbreaks at 28 camps in Louisiana.

&gt;Together, they reinforced the agency’s urgings that children eligible for vaccines be given them and outlined the potential consequences of lagging inoculations among young people, especially in certain states in the South and the Mountain West.

&gt;Fifty-seven percent of children 12 to 17 years old in the United States have been vaccinated. But that figure masks large gaps in coverage. Seventy-eight percent of children in that age group have been vaccinated in Massachusetts, for instance, but only 37 percent have in Louisiana.

&gt;”Implementation of high vaccination coverage coupled with multiple prevention strategies is critical to averting Covid-19 outbreaks in congregate settings, including overnight camps,” C.D.C. scientists wrote, noting that the experience of camps held crucial lessons for preventing outbreaks in schools this year.

&gt;One study found only nine Covid-19 cases among more than 7,000 campers and staff members at nine sleep-away camps that were heavily vaccinated and carried out tens of thousands of tests. The study attributed several of the cases to outings by staff members away from the camp grounds. At the camps, more than 93 percent of people at least 12 years old who were eligible for vaccines had received shots.

&gt;Between testing programs, vaccine coverage and quarantine policies, the camps managed to avoid any known secondary infections, the C.D.C. said.

&gt;The second study examined outbreaks at 28 camps in Louisiana, half of them sleep-away and half day camps. Only one of the camps mandated vaccines for staff members and contractors and one required indoor masking.

&gt;On average, the camps experienced outbreaks of roughly a dozen cases. The C.D.C. attributed the spread of the virus to the highly contagious Delta variant. Of the 135 campers included in the study who got sick despite being eligible for a coronavirus shot, 133 had not been vaccinated. All of the staff members who tested positive had not received vaccines.

There are also no religious exemptions for vaccinations. In California Charter schools are more like alternative public schools than insular schools that seem to be a problem in other states. This is largely due to having a powerful teachers union that was able to curtail the problems that other states have with charter schools. That law predates my time working in education so I don’t know a whole lot about it, but my administration has mentioned that a large reason for having such a strong vaccine law is that if a student requires a vaccine and it’s past due schools are not allowed to have that student on campus, this isn’t good for anyone because the student misses school, and the school loses ADA monies. In order to prevent all that the schools just gave out religious exemption forms to people who were past due on vaccines in order to expedite paperwork and keep the kids in class (this unknowingly happens to me in high school).

First dose: 
Friday 7pm got first shot of Pfizer. Felt pain and a tingly numbing sensation across entire arm. This came on quick. As in I had difficulty driving myself back home because my arm was throbbing. So probably hit like 15-20m after. Other than arm pain felt fine rest of evening.
Saturday 11a: Hit a wall. Was about to go grocery shopping but felt awful. Migraine-like headache, body aches, chills, I didn’t have a thermometer to check but I definitely had a fever. Was pretty much dead to the world all day. Felt like I had the flu. No respiratory problems. 
Next day (Sunday) felt great! Maybe even better. Like none of it happened and it was all a dream. 

Second covid shot: Friday 7p two weeks later on the dot (auto scheduled from first appt). My arm didn’t go numb or tingly this time. Pain is localized to injection site and didn’t come on until later that night. it’s sore to the point to where I can’t lift anything. Feels like a really bad arm day lol. No other symptoms. 
Next day (today, Saturday): More intense flu like symptoms. Extremely sensitive to light. Pulsating headache and body aches. What’s new this time is I am extremely thirsty and extremely nauseous. Like I can’t even look at a picture of or smell food without dry heaving. Never experienced any nausea this bad before.

Two new studies offer a possible explanation: The virus is evolving to spread more efficiently through air.

&gt;The realization that the coronavirus is airborne indoors transformed efforts to contain the pandemic last year, igniting fiery debates about masks, social distancing and ventilation in public spaces.

&gt;Most researchers now agree that the coronavirus is mostly transmitted through large droplets that quickly sink to the floor and through much smaller ones, called aerosols, that can float over longer distances indoors and settle directly into the lungs, where the virus is most harmful.

&gt;The new studies don’t fundamentally change that view. But the findings signal the need for better masks in some situations, and indicate that the virus is changing in ways that make it more formidable.

&gt;”This is not an Armageddon scenario,” said Vincent Munster, a virologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who led one of the new studies. “It is like a modification of the virus to more efficient transmission, which is something I think we all kind of expected, and we now see it happening in real time.”

&gt;…


&gt;Together, the new findings underscore the importance of masks for vaccinated people, especially in crowded spaces, experts said. Although people with breakthrough infections after vaccination are much less likely to spread the virus than unvaccinated people, the contagiousness of the variants raises the probability.

&gt;With billions of people worldwide vaccinated, and billions still unvaccinated, the virus may still change in unexpected ways, Dr. Munster said: “There might be additional evolutionary pressures, shaping the evolutionary direction of this virus.”",,,,1633185676,{},hf3pf0x,True,t3_pzwd32,False,False,t3_pzwd32,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pzwd32/is_the_coronavirus_getting_better_at_airborne/hf3pf0x/,1633312106.0,26,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,
