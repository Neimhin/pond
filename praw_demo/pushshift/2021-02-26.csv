&gt; Share the rationale
This involves explaining to people why certain behaviour is important. Transparency in sharing information and its rationale helps to build trust and increases the likelihood of cooperation.


&gt; Encourage active engagement
This involves:
• encouraging people to seek information from credible sources; and
• ensuring that neighbours, communities and networks receive and understand accurate
information, report possible influenza cases and help communities in managing ill people.
In this approach, people are viewed as “partners in prevention”, rather than simply as recipients of information. The approach is therefore likely to create ownership, resulting in better adoption of recommended behaviours and more proactive communities. Such partners in prevention are also more likely to find creative ways to mobilize community resources and help build capacity that might be useful in the future.


&gt; Empower people with information
People and communities will take their own decisions on the basis of the balance of forces of their own circumstances. The communication approach should emphasize information sharing and community problem solving as ways of helping people to find a set of doable actions, so that they ask “How can we effectively prevent infection and protect ourselves, our families and our community?”

&gt; Adapt recommendations to the local context
It is important to take into account people’s capacity to act on the advice being given. The recommended behaviour must be doable and be adapted to people’s lifestyle; otherwise, it will not be widely adopted.....

No I don't want to kill grandma. That's not what I'm saying. No I'm not ignorant to the science. If I'm being honest though that kind of house arrest is not something I could do past June. It got old for me, and I was really hating life. ""You should really get some mental help for that because you have no choice but to stay inside you POS."" We'll get to that in a minute.

I can imagine calling it house arrest will be a trigger for some people. I know, I know... If you can do it, why not everyone else? Call me a POS human being for not being like you and only going out for ""essential"" purposes, but honestly, you have no idea who I am. You have no idea how much I care about my fellow man or not. I follow the mask, 6 ft, and wash hands rules like everyone else. Believe me or don't.

I mean I highly doubt you give two cares about some strangers life story, but to give context, I had only just moved out of my parents house in 2019 to a whole new city at 21. I was ready to start the next phase of my life. Then when March 2020 hit, it felt like the end of what I knew as life for the foreseeable future. I was genuinely happy in 2019. New job, lots of dating opportunities, living with roommates, new places to explore, etc. 

You can think whatever comment you want about me personally, but by June, I had enough. It didn't feel like I was living life. I was just surviving. So I took a road trip across the entire west coast. Boy I can just imagine how people are going to hate me for that on Reddit... DOWNVOTES FOR DAYS

What's my point out of all this ranting? My point is that what the best situation for you may be isn't what's going to work for the next person. BUT GEE WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO REFUSE TO WEAR THE MASK? I'm not talking about that. I reluctantly wear it, but honestly, I wish I lived in somewhere like Iowa right now. No more mask mandates.

What I am talking about is the fact that no one gives a care about how these ""half assed"" lockdowns affect the entire fabric of society. NOW we're getting into mental health... My individual case aside, it seems to me from what I'm reading that children are having a tough time. Once bright kids are having issues with mental health, and you know what? This would all be fixed (there will be exceptions of course) by ending the restrictions. Y'all can preach about getting a professional, but what is it really going to do when the issue lies with the restrictions?

Obviously I'm not actually recommending we end restrictions right now, but my point is that if we're gonna have these lockdowns, why do we only care about protecting grandma and immunocompromised people? Because people are dying and that's all that matters? Honestly, a lot of that empathy I felt for all those grandma's dying has greatly diminished. I just feel numb to all the deaths at this point. So why does the government not give a care about the young people who don't even know what their future is gonna look like? What about the people who have had no choice but to be on unemployment since March? 

OH GREAT. ANOTHER WHATABOUTIST. Yeah. I am. Because I think their lives matter just as much as grandma. I don't know the answer to this, but it doesn't help when people on this subreddit and all over this country just preach and preach we're doing the right thing. Seriously? GTFO.

Nearly 30 percent said they were seeing more patients overall.

But according to Vaile Wright, the senior director of health care innovation at the A.P.A., this might not capture the full extent of the demand for mental health practitioners because the survey did not ask the therapists whether they had to turn away clients because they were already booked.

Medical workers treating novel coronavirus patients started receiving the first batch of the vaccine developed by U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. in South Korea on Saturday. 

Authorities are currently working to vaccinate seven people per bottle, which is higher than the previous estimate of six. 

The National Medical Center said they are seeking on-site verification to maximize the number of recipients by utilizing ""low dead space (LDS)"" syringes, developed by S.

You have to consider a few things about clinical trials efficacy rates.

First, they only look for specific outcomes like a positive Covid test. That includes people who had mild or no symptoms and people who died. They don’t differentiate the two in top line numbers. They are also very limited in numbers - literally only 100-200 people actually got COVID in the entire trial, and so the data is not very accurate or precise.

If you look consumer debt specifically credit card debt has plunged over the last year it's been paid down by over 1.5 trillion dollars. People aren't spending money, they're getting relief checks, and they're not eating out or spending money on other discretionary items. I know several people who are making the strategic move to not pay their rent on the theory that they'll get bailed out by the federal government, and/or worst case when the moratorium ends or their lease ends they get kicked out, but no court will actually enforce a judgment against them for the unpaid rent.

it was similar to the mortgage crisis when I knew people who were making $300,000 choosing not to pay their mortgages, because they knew they could live those homes for 2 to 3 years before the banks would eventually do something about it.

Secondarily, even assuming that's not the case, and no more Tommy's been put in place, the worst that would have happened is some portion of people would have stopped paying, and would have been evicted, and as you suggest, rents would have gone down, but they aren't going to drop off a cliff. Some income is better than no income. And that would be a legitimate function of market forces to have pervasive vacancies force rents down.

The utilitarian argument that their landlords are better off now with a moratorium and no rent payments coming in versus the scenario of no moratorium simply doesn't add up.

so let's ignore the utilitarian argument I simply look at the moral one. Government seizing stealing the ability of landlords to engage in contract is evil. A market crash that forces prices down is simply a feature of macroeconomics. And has no morality to it. It just is.

Wearing N95s for a prolonged period of time is highly uncomfortable because if it fits properly, there is 0% leakage. Ask any health care worker and they can tell you a properly fitted N95 is not comfortable to wear for hours on end.

Valved N95s should be allowed as they are more comfortable, but there was a massive freak out about Valved N95s despite the greater supply of them. NISOH recently did a study and found that valves were actually fine (depending on some variables they were about as good as cloth/loose fitting surgical masks as a source control), but the public still has a shitstain freakout about valves.

That being said, the messaging is fucking awful right now. N95s are not in short supply anymore, nowhere near as bad at the beginning. They were attempting to control the source of N95s for a long time because the Federal Government was failing at their job miserably. If everyone did wear N95s, KF94s, KN95s, etc. it would really drive down numbers even more considering those masks would act as both a source control, and as a very strong form of defense against the virus.

If you are able to put up with the uncomfortable nature of N95s, you should wear them until you can get fully vaccinated. Afterwards, you can switch to something more comfortable.

The way the tech works is multifaceted. There is the filtering droplets aspect that any face covering would give. The smaller the holes, the smaller the droplet that can be inhaled through it. There is the nonwoven aspect. A woven mask has a straight-through path for tiny droplets, like a screen door with holes too large blocks birds but lets mosquitos through. A lamination of nonwoven fibers denies the straight-through path, resulting in more droplets colliding with the mask.

Both of these benefit from sanitizing, to the limit of their ability to help. But the finest particles drift through these two like it's not even there. Understanding how this works is key to safe and effective sanitizing of a KN95 mask.

It's electrostatic precipitation. The dielectric fibers in the medical grade masks generate an electromagnetic charge when dry air moves past. The finest airborne particles are magnetically attracted and cling to the fibers. For this to work, the mask must be dry and the fibers must not be chemically altered or coated with something that defeats the electrostatic properties. This is why they are sold as time limited single use disposable items.

So. Do not use any sort of detergent. It will leave a film that defeats the purpose. Use dry heat and/or UV in appropriate amounts. This article includes some methods. https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/dry-heat-can-effectively-sanitize-n95-masks

It’s just a ~feeling~ at this point but I think it’s right. We all know vaccine supply is expected to go through the roof in the coming weeks/months. If cities and counties are able to do tens of thousands of shots a day then they need to have arms to go into. Limiting to tiers slows everyone down and could leave appointments empty. At some point the only way to guarantee every appointment every day is booked is by allowing anyone to show up. The question is when does that happen. 

If only 60% of American adults want a vaccine ASAP that is ROUGHLY 150m people. Minus 20m people with J&amp;J, x2 for the MRNA vaccines and that means 260m total MRNA doses needed for the ready pop.

Your risk of being harmed by it with no vaccine was pretty low already, and so far evidence is pretty strong that your risk of being harmed by it if you get infected after vaccination is basically zero, though we aren't completely sure.

The follow-up question, more important right now, is: if I'm vaccinated and exposed to it and lose the vaccine odds and become infected anyway, even though it seems this poses no risk to me, am I still as likely to spread it to others? Your risk of spreading if you weren't vaccinated was very high. Right now there is some evidence that this risk also goes down significantly if you get infected despite vaccination, which would ultimately mean that the 90% effective vaccine is, in practically, 100% effective, because even if you still get infected, being infected no longer matters. This would also mean that as long as one person is vaccinated, they can interact with another unvaccinated person with no risk. But there is only some evidence about this and not conclusive yet.

right but, people who have a cold or the flu aren't legally banned from those same pubic places.

everything is on a spectrum, there are some things that are so dangerous that the government has decided you cannot do it even if you don't hurt anyone, because it's irresponsible (like drinking and driving. still illegal even if you don't crash).

my point, and what i said, was that you don't have a right to be *free* from risk of disease. you pointing out that *some* dangerous things are banned doesn't really negate that.

&gt; Regarding what you said about acceptance, yeah I‘m sure of that and that‘s what kind of bothers me: The death rate is so low that people don‘t give s shit and don‘t show solidarity with those it will end up hitting.

the death rate *matters* though, in the context of the countermeasures taken against it. small businesses have been shuttered, many families bankrupted never to recover, children have had their mental growth stunted by missing a year of in person schooling, etc.

so i would not agree with the analysis that people simply don't care that others are dying, rather, people are taking in the context of how dangerous the virus actually is, and using that to make decisions.

it's quite simple to demonstrate with an extreme example - if a virus had a 0.0001% death rate and i claimed that we should ""show solidarity"" with the people who will die from it by mandating a vaccine for that virus, would you still agree?",,,1614382273,{},gowq9ja,False,t3_lshb2i,False,False,t1_gosuste,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lshb2i/should_covid19_vaccination_be_mandatory_of/gowq9ja/,1614530445,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

First off, New York State’s vaccine rollout has been nationally average. It’s not been “terrible” (except for initial website problems during the initial rollout) and it’s not been spectacular either. But the doses are getting into people’s arms and as a country, we are far ahead of just about every other nation on this planet aside from Israel and the U.K. (and some Gulf states). If you’re looking for a policy failure, look to Canada and Europe who didn’t make the necessary investments in time and thus will have to wait far longer to inoculate their populations whilst the virus still rages with variants running rampant.

Second off, don’t be so selfish. There are people along the track of qualifications who deserve it more than you do (the elderly, food retailers, first responders, medical professionals, etc.). This isn’t the flu vaccine, this is a novel vaccine produced in record time whose makers are trying to produce as much as possible on the shortest amount of time possible whilst not ruining its quality.

Third off, the New York you know and love will come back eventually because it has to. There are still tens of millions of people who want visit the city and the businesses they frequent will need many more people to man their lines than what they are currently working with. Just be thankful this isn’t a prolonged monstrosity of a recession like the Great Depression or even the Great Recession of 2008.

I am aware, however, that Sinovac, like traditional vaccines, is made up of inactivated/dead virus , and I'm wondering if this may temporarily cause a false positive in PCR tests.

This is the best-reasoned article I've seen taking this point of view, and it has an actual explanation of the mechanism by which vaccinated people might still transmit the virus.  It's head-and-shoulders above all the ""but it isn't proven!"" hand-wringing I've seen from other sources.

That said, the risk is very low, as this article acknowledges:  since the virus doesn't replicate much in a vaccinated person, it means there isn't as much of it to spread.  And since a vaccinated person isn't coughing, it means there isn't as much means for it to spread.

So all in all, even if the vaccine doesn't provide full sterilizing immunity (which isn't known yet) there's some risk but not much.  In a world where hundreds of millions of unvaccinated people are spreading the disease, is the slight risk of vaccinated people spreading it bad enough to keep locking them in their homes?

In my state (Washington) it’s basically sorted by age until “summer”, and then they start considering other risk factors like essential workers that need to go to work in group settings, cormobidities, etc.

If you are a relatively healthy 49 year old (and I say relatively because you have to have severe problems to qualify while under 50) and can work from home you won’t get the vaccine until probably August. And it’s actually much worse than this because *most people* fit in this bucket, so realistically people in this group are looking at October, if not later, unless they somehow get in early or we get a massive boost in supply. They’ve not even actually published a schedule that says when you’ll be eligible. If you have to work in a grocery store *maybe* May or June, depending on how you read the specifics of the schedule.

But if you are 65 you get access to the vaccine *a month ago* no questions asked.

This is not an good distribution based on mitigating risk because:
1. It does not include your risk of *catching* the disease, which for people over 65 that aren’t living in a group home should be approximately zero (if they were actually following the “do not gather” guidance).
2. It front loads older people in front of people with cormobidities, seemingly arbitrarily.
3. It does nothing for essential workers, who are at much higher risk of catching the disease (another variant of #1).

So in this context it looks like the state has decided an individuals actual risk is too hard to calculate, so they are basically arbitrarily deciding to give vaccinations by age due to a correlation of risk of death *if you catch it*. (And I say this is correlative because there are some theories on why this occurs, but they are not actually caused by age itself) I’m not thrilled about it, it’s clearly arbitrarily biasing towards older people. But we got to do it by some order, and the statement was that the guidance/restrictions needed to be the same even for those that were vaccinated. A vaccine doesn’t mean you can gather or whatever, not till enough people to get to herd immunity. So let’s get shots in arms.

But now if the guidance is changing based on if you have a vaccine, it’s different. And with the states chosen distribution system that turns this into, “the elderly don’t have the same rules as everyone else, because we arbitrarily decided to give them vaccines first,” that’s where the problem is introduced.

Privilege is a benefit you get through no action of your own. Like being raised by wealthy parents enabling you to be more connected. In this case those that are older are privileged in that they did nothing to be older, you don’t get to choose how old you are, you simply are that age, and the system is being established to arbitrarily (or at best, correlatively) benefit people in that group by giving them the vaccine and then easing restrictions on them after the get it.

They are still doing a huge disservice by playing up doom and gloom with the vaccines, talking about all the things we still can't do and all the potential problems it could have- e.g. ""It might not protect against a variant, and you might be able to still transmit with the vaccine, so keep following all of the public health guidelines!""

But it wasn't exclusively the US government, either. But it definitely wasn't done independently.

And Trump tried to claim entire credit, which is also not true.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Facts First**: *Pfizer's vaccine progress is certainly not solely attributable to the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed public-private partnership program. But it was not accurate for Pfizer to suggest that it is operating entirely apart from Operation Warp Speed; the company has a major agreement to sell at least 100 million doses of its vaccine to the federal government, and Pfizer acknowledged in a Monday statement to CNN that it is in fact ""participating"" in Operation Warp Speed through this deal. Also, at least some independent experts say the Trump administration deserves partial credit for Pfizer's progress.*   
  
&gt;  
&gt;It's true that Pfizer, unlike some other pharmaceutical companies, did not accept federal money for research into a coronavirus vaccine. Pfizer, unlike these competitors, is not getting payments up front even before proving its effort has been successful.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, the Trump administration [**agreed**](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/07/22/us-government-engages-pfizer-produce-millions-doses-covid-19-vaccine.html) in July to buy at least $1.95 billion worth of a Pfizer vaccine, at least 100 million doses,[ **if Pfizer does get a vaccine authorized**](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-agreement-us-government-600) by the Food and Drug Administration.

Couldn't the same be said about... literally any activity? Especially driving. I mean, statistically, we ARE more likely to die from a car accident than the flu. Wouldn't we all be better off if every single one of us took public transit, being driven by licensed drivers in safe, well-maintained vehicles who always follow the rules of the road/tracks and never speed? Besides, it's far more efficient, and would help the environment significantly. That would save FAR more lives than wearing masks forever, after all.

If you don't agree that, that means one of two things. Either A. you don't actually care about saving lives, and just care about wearing masks, or B. you personally want to keep driving, and putting others at risk. Of course, you might also agree with the statement I made above, in which case I would have to give you credit, since at least you're consistent.

We didn't know this until recently and maybe it wouldn't have made a difference in vaccine priority anyway.  Virologists I heard interviewed months ago did say they expected that vaccines would most likely reduce transmission, but they couldn't be certain. And again, I'm not saying SAGE was incorrect in their recommendations. I'm just trying to understand better. 

I guess I do understand better now because we didn't know for sure until very recently that transmission is reduced and it would be hard to prioritize people in a more complicated system and it's hard to shift gears in regards to the administrative issues. 

But I don't understand why people are so adamant that transmission definitely isn't reduced. If that were the case then we can never reach herd immunity and that's something I don't want to contemplate if I don't have to.

&gt;“Understanding the progression of the pandemic in our communities over time can inform actions, such as strategic use of limited resources, outreach efforts, and targeted testing and vaccinations, allowing Oklahoma leaders to more effectively and equitably mitigate the impacts of COVID-19,” said Halley Reeves, vice president of community health impact for OU Health.

&gt;“Analyzing wastewater samples is presently the best and fastest way of obtaining population-level knowledge about the genetic variants being transmitted in Oklahoma,” said Katrin Kuhn, infectious disease epidemiologist and associate professor at the OU Hudson College of Public Health. “Knowledge of how many of these variants are circulating in the population, and where they are transmitted, helps us prepare better for the impact of a potential outbreak of a genetic variant.”

Vaccines stimulate immune response. For adults, a vaccine-stimulated immune response is manageable. Children's immune systems can sometimes overreact. Example, what we see with COVID responses with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome. 

What happens if a significant proportion of children go into anaphylactic shock from one of the ingredients in the vaccine? Then the FDA is to blame, and vaccine trust is irreparably damaged. Implying that adults and children immune systems are the same and should be treated the same is irresponsible and is what sows distrust in this system.

So you're saying that, in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence concerning masks' ability to prevent the transmission of a variety of communicable diseases, we should ignore that evidence because, once upon a time, we had a negative experience which involved masks as a symbol of that experience? So instead of being mature people who understand the mask's benefit, we run away from them because they stir up negative emotions? That is quite literally absurd. 
First of all, speak for yourself when we say ""we didn't care about the flu before."" You don't get to speak for all of society about people's level of concern about getting sick. Beyond that, maybe COVID can serve as a watershed moment that changes how we view contagions. That would be, I would argue, a way to turn this awful experience into a positive. You disagree, apparently. 
In any case, I was only using the flu as one example of a contagious virus. Common cold would be another example. Lack of widespread long-term effects from these viruses is no reason to say we should all just embrace getting infected and infecting others. That is, on the most basic level, simply gross. 
This also entirely ignores the potential of using masks to avoid another potential pandemic that could pop up and be defeated by masking before we even knew it ever existed. A long shot, perhaps, but a testament to masks' role as having potentially large gains, with no downsides. 
To address the downside of environmental impact, the fact that you would even say that ""a year of mask litter is acceptable"" shows how poor your ability to engage in theoretical discussions is. No level of mask litter is acceptable, and a mask recycling program should of course be implemented. Beyond that, washable cloth masks are just as good as surgical masks.
I guess I would disagree with your comparison of a mask to a sledgehammer. It's literally a cloth covering that you put over your mouth and nose when you are utilizing essential public services like grocery stores and public transit. At the end of the day, it is simply a basic courtesy to your fellow human, whether your feelings say so or not.",,,1614392027,{},goxd2ew,False,t3_lt42kw,False,True,t1_gox6fyx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lt42kw/chicago_city_departments_begin_planning_for/goxd2ew/,1614541177,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

I’m saying that we’ve passed the threshold where it’s safer now for vaccinated people to resume some of their normal life but not go crazy just yet. My point was that why we might hypothetically be telling vaccinated people not to gather is not just because they might set a bad example, but that vaccinated people themselves under certain conditions can still put people at risk and should still take certain precautions until those conditions are alleviated to protect other people. We’re at a point where a lot of those conditions are met where they can resume some of their normal lives but we don’t want them going crazy just yet. 

&gt; We do know that most of these vaccines are nearly 100% effective in stopping hospilizations though....so if the health care system isn't in danger. 

Hospitalizations in those that are vaccinated. Vaccinated people still have a small probability of being able to spread the disease and causing transmission chains that hospitalize other people. Say the vaccine is 95% effective at stopping transmission per vaccinated individual but vaccinated people are told to resume their normal lives and thus interact with 100 times more people than they did if they when they were unvaccinated (which I don’t think is unrealistic in a lot of circumstances) then depending on immune percentage of the population (vaccinated+recovered+dead) it could temporarily cancel out or reverse the benefit. 

&gt; a majority of Americans are vaccinated....whats the problem again? 

This isn’t true. Roughly 13-15% of Americans have received at least their first dose. Not even close to that are fully immunized. We are no where near a majority of Americans.

&gt;So it looks like everything  is shifted: hospitalized cases end up being able to stay at home with  more moderate symptoms, people who would have had moderate symptoms end  up asymptomatic, and people who would have been asymptomatic end up not  testing positive at all. Oh, and people who would have died stayed  alive. There’s that, too.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you just look at efficacy in preventing asymptomatic infection,  you get a really low number (16% efficacy, confidence interval banging  into the zero baseline). But my interpretation of that is that the  overall number of asymptomatic patients didn’t change too much, because  as just mentioned, **the “would have been asymptomatic” group is not  showing infection at all, and their numbers have been replaced by people  from the “would have been showing symptoms” cohort, who are now just  asymptomatic.** And since transmission would seem to depend on viral load  (among other factors), reducing viral load across the population (as  shown by the significant decrease in PCR positivity) would certainly be  **expected to slow transmission**.

If we had either one without the other it’d be fine.

There were some grumbles but nothing really legally problematic about the distribution methods many states chose on their own.

If it was a free for all/first come first serve for vaccinations there’s likely to be no major complaint about an ease in restrictions for those that are vaccinated on their own, especially now that it’s been shown those that are vaccinated are not likely to spread the disease. (well, I imagine people would complain the rich and connected get access first, but as seen in Florida, that’s happening anyway).

The method of distribution of vaccines only becomes a systemic discrimination issue if you tie vaccination to differential treatment.

In other words: If we were not restricting who could have access to the vaccine this change of restrictions would not be problematic, but because we are already doing so it is problematic because we end up with both at once.

This is very typically how systemic discrimination comes about, you look at a system and make a decision that favors one group or another, ignoring (often times unintentionally) that the definition of those groups is based on a protected class through some other side channel.",,,1614379603,{},gowhuk6,False,t3_lsxtyf,False,True,t1_gow9g0n,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lsxtyf/fully_vaccinated_people_can_gather_individually/gowhuk6/,1614526602,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

In your version you’re talking as if the world weren’t locked up for a year. *Everyone* was barred from going out, not just the at risk people. The at risk people needed to stay inside *either way*.

I’ve also heard the vaccine is better at long lasting immunity than getting infected, which is miraculous. In both situations you’re training your immune system. The suggestion that people who have been infected have no immunity and that the only way to get immunity is through the vaccine is wrong.

People who’ve had the virus and recovered should be dead last on the list of people signing up for it. It’s like putting on a second seatbelt.

A good example is AIDS. It's rare that AIDS *directly kills* anyone. It fucks up your immune system to the point that a basic cold can take you out. COVID has a similar end result: Your immune system gets scrambled by the virus so you die from otherwise low-risk pneumonia infections, or your heart needs to pump so much blood to compensate for the lost oxygen that it becomes exhausted past the point that healthy hearts can normally take, and poof - your otherwise healthy, cross-country running 30 year old friend is dead.
