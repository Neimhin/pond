I was really surprised by the super hyper of the pfizer news.

&gt;(CNN)Drugmaker  Pfizer said Monday an early look at data from its coronavirus vaccine  shows it is more than 90% effective -- a much better than expected  efficacy if the trend continues.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  so-called interim analysis looked at the first 94 confirmed cases of  Covid-19 among the more than 43,000 volunteers who got either two doses  of the vaccine or a placebo. It found that fewer than 10% of infections  were in participants who had been given the vaccine. More than 90% of  the cases were in people who had been given a placebo.

It is still at early stage but blown up by media and its logistic headache would be another problem. But who cares? Stock price shot up.

And this case, Bloomberg is quite professional. This kind of news is expected and exactly why phase III trial.

But I am sure lots of other media would be happy to blow it up too, especially those usual suspects.

My husband is a nurse in a hospital and I was talking to him about the ""idea"" of covid the other day. I eat, sleep, and breath covid talk because he deals with it daily. I hear about all of his patients that get sent to ICU. I hear about the ones that die from covid. 

I religiously wear a mask and keep my distance from people. Even if we go out to eat and are outside, I don't feel comfortable being maskless of there's a table close to us. You don't want to get covid. It's has lasting, systemic effects on your body. 

But I was wondering how people who don't have family or close friends that are health care workers handle this. They don't have the direct line to someone who sees it daily. 

Luckily for us, we're in Connecticut (which has one of the lower case counts, but rising). Even with our hospitals not at 100%, the hospital he works at is always short staffed. He gets mandated frequently. Since March 2020, we've had to get mandatory tests and quarantine for 2 week periods THREE times because of his possible with exposure at work (and this is with full ppe and being cautious, but things happen). 

Please take this seriously. If covid is still just an idea for many of you and you think it's a pain in the ass to wear a mask everywhere, we know. It's not ideal. But it can also save lives.

Italy had some regions which were overwhelmed and it was really cruel to see recordings people dropping dead on the streets doctors having to deceided who gets a ventilator and who gets sedated so he doesn't suffer too much dying.

Even if it's just 1% death rate you have to consider if everybody in the USA gets infected that's 3.3million deaths. Then there are 10% serious cases that's 33million with unpredictable aftereffects. Let's say one third dies to the next cold or dies because their life expectation got shortened by a lot. That's 11million more deaths in a short timeframe.

Added up that's 14.3 million deaths because of Covid and that example is an ideal scenario where the health care system isn't overwhelmed.

Rural areas have to incentivize this, and they’ve done it in various ways. Several rural states (Kansas and a few others) have Rural Doctors Programs, where the state pays off a certain portion of med school loan debt in exchange for doctors agreeing to work in rural areas for a certain number of years.

It talks about where were at with the Covid-19 vaccine and how the process comes about. Host is Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Paul Mecurio, with guest Dr. Paul Offit, MD, Director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

Sure I could go for a run in the summer, but soon it'll be below freezing where I live.

My gym requires masks (and unlike a restaurant you can actually keep your mask on the entire time while working out), temperature checks at the door, gives everyone a spray bottle and wipes to clean equipment after use, has set up air filtration systems on every floor, and I go during the lunch hour where there's maybe 15-20 people in the entire three-floor gym.

Sure, a lot of gyms aren't going that far, but it's borderline rude to throw around that much attitude to anyone who's just trying to exercise. I also talked to my gym's manager the other day and since they reopened in August he hasn't had a single member notify him that they've contracted covid.

And actually, I think your question is a really interesting one. I would like to know it, too tbh. I am not a scientist and only interested in the concept of mRNA vaccine (which is why I follow BioNTech's progress a bit), well, mostly I want to know what solution for the pandemic could look like when I discovered the concept of mRNA vaccine.  

There was a [press release](https://investors.biontech.de/news-releases/news-release-details/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-early-positive-update-german-phase/) from BioNTech which mentions it. 

&gt;All subjects in the prime-boost cohorts, except for two at the lowest dose level, had CD4+ T cell responses. Cytokine profiling of the RBD-specific CD4+ T cells demonstrated a TH1-dominant profile for these cells. 29 of the 36 tested subjects also mounted an RBD-specific functional, **CD8+ T cell response that was comparable to memory responses** observed against cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and **influenza virus**.

&gt;Overall, the data suggested that BNT162b1 could potentially be administered safely, with a manageable tolerability profile. **Local reactions and systemic events after injection with BNT162b1 at all dose levels were transient, generally mild to moderate, with occasional severe events (Grade 3) of flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions**. All adverse events resolved spontaneously and were managed with simple measures. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported, and there were no withdrawals due to adverse events related to the vaccine.

I can't tell you much about the functioning of the immune system. BNT says it comes from a memory effect from the body when the T-Cells get created. You will most likely need an actual Scientist for the answer. I never thought much after reading TH1, CD4 or CD8 and just thought it is okay as long as they have an explanation.

TLDR: there are documented cases, although it appears rare at this point. Main concerns are: how long does immunity last (unlikely to be forever since it's an RNA virus (these mutate way more than DNA viruses, but could become immune maybe in certain people), could you get sicker if get a second time (maybe?) and are there different strains (appears to be but thankfully as of now they don't seem to be extremely different.
--------------------------------------------------------
Certainly seems like it's happening, albeit at this point is relatively rare. The concern regards the further out we get (especially before a vaccine comes); does COVID itself mutate more or does our immunity wane at some point? Some viruses like smallpox give lifelong immunity after having it. Given COVID-19 is a novel virus we don't know enough yet. 

Along those lines, admitting that we don't know enough yet, anecdotally from speaking to some physicians and reading the literature, there might be a chance that if you had a very mild infection initially it could portend a chance of having a more serious infection if get a second time (the recent case of a 25 year old Nevada man being hospitalized on oxygen after the second infection being an example). However, given the paucity of a significant volume of data it's hard to determine that.

COVID is an RNA virus (other type of viruses are DNA); RNA viruses are inherently more prone to mutations. While thankfully it doesn't seem like COVID has mutated to a more lethal disease, it does seem to have different variants that are pretty similar but have slight differences (not necessarily important as of now it seems of the symptoms one may lead to, moreso that it could make you more susceptible to reinfection if get a different variant after a first infection). Notably, HIV is an RNA virus and there is a small subset of people ~10% that are completely immune to it. 
""A study posted September 28 to medRxiv confirms four reinfections in Qatar using genetic sequencing data that found distinct viral variants between the first and second infections.""

Have spoken to a few physician colleagues and they've personally seen instances (although not a ton) of people re-infected with COVID (eg a positive test, separated by negative tests and then a period of weeks or more likely months later another positive test with symptoms).

Published in The Lancet, a top medical journal.
""The patient had two positive tests for SARS-CoV-2, the first on April 18, 2020, and the second on June 5, 2020, separated by two negative tests done during follow-up in May, 2020. Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 showed genetically significant differences between each variant associated with each instance of infection. The second infection was symptomatically more severe than the first.""
""These findings suggest that the patient was infected by SARS-CoV-2 on two separate occasions by a genetically distinct virus. Thus, previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 might not guarantee total immunity in all cases. All individuals, whether previously diagnosed with COVID-19 or not, should take identical precautions to avoid infection with SARS-CoV-2. The implications of reinfections could be relevant for vaccine development and application.""

I’m going to assume that Pfizer has been proactively mfg since August and that it takes say 4 months to generate 50 million doses. So that’s 36 months to make the needed remaining 450 million doses. Maybe it’s only one dose that’s needed and that’s still a year and a half or not until mid-2022 that we’ve got enough product. This is just the US population of course and we have an advantage to achieving immunity because a significant portion of our population has already been exposed, may 25% in some densely populated areas but then you have to account for anti-vax’ers and rate of distribution and an effective rate that may likely go down in non-controlled settings. All of which will delay the timeline to getting society wide immunity. I’m not going to be naive and assume by any stretch of the imagination that this product will come solely to the US. So that really means a date that’s much much farther out for world wide immunity with just this product.

In the pictures of all these events on FB, people are crammed shoulder to shoulder with no masks in sight.  Halloween saw huge parties.  No masks.  Nobody wears masks anywhere.  Ever.

And like I said in my post a couple weeks ago our numbers are going up and up.  We went from 10-15 new cases a day to 70+ cases.

However, the last two times we were nearing that line, they changed the reporting metrics rather than move to virtual.

I'm 48. Trust me, summer '22 is not hilariously far off. 

Think about it. If it takes 6-8 months to really build out vaccine infrastructure, that means we'll have it done by the time it starts getting cold again in '21. 

So again, we'll be able to mitigate winter '21/'22 but winter '20/'21 is gonna be grim.

If you have 20k people get a placebo, and 20k people get the vaccine, randomized and double blinded so not even the docs administering shots know who got what, you then track who gets Covid-19.  Say you find 100 cases in a couple months 10 from the vaccine pool and 90 fom the placebo pool.  (They test everyone to catch even asymptomatic cases).  It’s obvious then that the vaccine is preventing a significant number of infections.  If 1 out of 10 of the infections in the vaccine group were severe, and 25 out of 90 of the placebo infections were severe, that would also indicate that the vaccine reduces severity in addition to preventing infection.

It's not exactly shocking information that the virus affects older people more than younger people. [Here's](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm) a break down of the deaths by age group.

What I think a lot of people under appreciate is how small of a target this gives us compared to an incredibly large amount of its potential harm reduction. Let's start from the group that has the highest absolute value of deaths- 65 to 74- and count upward. We're talking about people 65 and up.

That group represents 171,814 of the recorded 217,348 deaths: **79.05%**. That age group also has 54,058,236 people in the United States- well, assuming they haven't been discounted from the tally after dying- out of the population of 328,239,523: **16.47%**. The quick and dirty version of this is that vaccinating around 16% of the population would prevent around 79% of deaths. That's a pretty good deal.

I don't know who's gonna be distributing the vaccines- it might come down to the states or the federal government, and they might start being given out under Trump and continue to be distributed under Biden- but I will say that I think a massive focus needs to be given on the elderly, after health care workers of course, as the CDC has already advised. Other than people with pre existing conditions, I'm going to be a little concerned if we see young people getting the vaccine before every elderly American who wants it has gotten it. It might be a little sadistic, but I see this as a numbers game first. Making someone over 65 immune is, again by a quick and dirty calculation, almost *five times as likely* to prevent a death as immunizing someone under 65. That's a huge deal.

Again, I'm not blowing anyone's mind and I'm sure the well qualified experts making decisions about this have already considered this kind of outlook. I guess my point is two fold: It's a great idea to immunize the elderly as early as possible, and no one should be upset when it comes out that young people won't be getting the vaccine for some time after the elderly.",,,1604965726,,{},gbrus41,False,t3_jr8s7j,False,True,t3_jr8s7j,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jr8s7j/fauci_us_could_begin_distributing_covid_vaccine/gbrus41/,1604970153,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

Im making zero claims.

Its been widely reported that one of the reasons this is done was because of the potential to impact vaccines. If this reporting is wrong I would be interested in knowing why. You reaponded with a rambling tweet that contracted some of your claims.

Your own argument consistently contradicts itself. Why do you believe one scientist on twitter over those who felt it could impact vaccines? Why is that guy the only scientist with a valid opinion? Youre not making sense.

The interesting question is how much help you get from partial immunity in the next 6-18 months before there is a vaccine (that has reached a majority). For example, how much does 30% immunity do to the reproduction rate? It’s a reduction of R by 30% and likely more. 

The optimistic scenario is that such a level of immunity allows slightly looser restrictions while keeping R below 1, in an area where a naive population would have e.g R=1.4 so exponential growth. 

It would be a kind of herd immunity (it’s immunity that drove R below 1) but such a 30% immunity is not a true herd immunity in the normal sense because it’s only working *together with* distancing and other mitigations.
