Considering that the mRNA vaccines are highly effective against the Delta variant, I’m not sure a surge would matter for the majority of vaccinated people or those around them. Plus, Quebec and Ontario are likely to get near or exceed 80% coverage. Even if Alberta is more vaccine hesitant, I doubt it would plateau at 65% fully vaccinated, last I checked at least 69% of Albertas population has at least gotten one dose.

I disagree with that, slightly. I think love should be unconditional when there's no toxicity present in the relationship/actions of others.

Like, if you're in a relationship w/ your parents where they abuse you constantly, and expect you to put out for them (force out ""I love you,"" ""respect"" (fear them and) their authority, etc.) Love is supposed to be unconditional, since a chikd doesn't deserve abuse. They deserve to feel safe in a home, and like they're not a burden.

With that said, I 100% agree with your reasonings, but I word it differently. You aren't owed a relationship/attachment if you're the problem, just like they're not owed a relationship with you. It more has to do with when boundaries are crossed, for me. Crossing of boundaries that one can't forgive, and the boundary breaker can't make up for? No more.

Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said at the CECC press briefing that cluster infections around the country are now one of the main focuses of disease prevention efforts, including the one in Pingtung County.

The cluster in Pingtung originated from a woman and her grandson who recently returned to Taiwan from Peru.

Of the 12 COVID-19 cases in the cluster, eight of the people infected have now been confirmed to have the Delta variant of the virus, according to new genome sequencing results Sunday, Chen said.

Because the remaining four cases in the cluster are all relatives of those infected with the Delta variant, it is likely that they have also been infected with the same variant, Chen said.

The Delta variant of COVID-19 was first detected in India, and is the ""most transmissible"" of the variants identified so far, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The Pingtung cluster involves the first locally transmitted cases of the Delta variant in Taiwan, and the government has quarantined 173 contacts of the patients as well as stepped up vaccination efforts in the area.

Of the 88 domestic cases reported Sunday, 41 were in New Taipei, 33 in Taipei, and eight in Tainan.
Taoyuan reported three cases, while one each was reported in Hsinchu City and Pingtung and Nantou counties.

The source of infection in 60 of the cases has been identified, 26 are under investigation, and two have unknown sources, the CECC said.


There was also one new COVID-19 case that originated outside of Taiwan, involving a Taiwanese man in his 20s who recently returned from Austria.
The nine deaths were three men and six women in their 40s to 90s, who passed away between June 22 and June 26. They all had chronic illnesses, according to the CECC.

To date, Taiwan has confirmed a total of 14,634 COVID-19 cases, over 13,200 of which are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded more than 100 cases in a single day since the beginning of the pandemic.

The number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths in the country has risen to 632, with all except 12 recorded since May 15, CECC data shows.

I don't have the time or inclination to list out all of the infectious illnesses that can be treated with a variety of pharmaceutical drugs, but to throw out a few, let's start with strep throat, certain types of pneumonia, various types of cold and flu, etc. Doctors will commonly prescribe medications to treat symptoms - like decongestants, cough syrups, etc. - even if they can't treat the actual illness itself.

Nobody said it was. You keep trying to focus this on COVID, but again, the comment you replied to did not specify COVID. The exchange went as follows:

""I will basically never go into a place with a higher than average concentration of sick people without a mask again - hospital, doctor's office, pharmacy, etc. Probably not grocery stores either."" (sick people = not specific to COVID.)

In response: ""Especially the pharmacy and ER, literally 100% chance you’re being exposed."" You are assuming they mean exposed [to COVID] when I am reading it as exposed to [infectious illnesses of all kinds].

Nobody said COVID was spread primarily in pharmacies or even that you're more likely to catch COVID there. They said you have a ""literally 100% chance of being exposed"" if you're in the pharmacy or the ER.

But the most damning part:

There were no clusters of non-Delta infections comprising &gt;2 individuals,

&gt;	whereas there were ten such clusters for Delta variant. Importantly, the median Ct value of B.1.617.2 Delta variant infections was 16.5 versus 19 for non-Delta (p&lt;0.05, Extended Data Figure 1), consistent with higher viral load in vaccine breakthrough infections where the Delta variant was responsible.

[],,CrypticWolfe,,,[],,,,text,t2_hk3o9,False,False,[],"Increasingly, frustrated teenagers are searching for ways to be vaccinated without their parents’ consent. Some have found their way to VaxTeen.org, a vaccine information site run by Kelly Danielpour, a Los Angeles teenager.  
  
The site offers guides to state consent laws, links to clinics, resources on straightforward information about Covid-19 and advice for how teenagers can engage parents.  
  
“Someone will ask me, ‘I need to be able to consent at a vaccine clinic that is open on weekends and that is on my bus route. Can you help?’” said Ms. Danielpour, 18, who will begin her freshman year at Stanford in the fall.  
  
She started the site two years ago, well before Covid. The daughter of a pediatric neurosurgeon and an intellectual property lawyer, she realized that most adolescents know neither the recommended vaccine schedule nor their rights.  
  
“We automatically talk about parents but not about teens as having opinions on this issue,” she said. “I decided I needed to help.” Ms. Danielpour wrangled experts to help her understand vaccination and consent laws, and she recruited teenagers to be “VaxTeen ambassadors.”  
  
“I want teenagers to be able to say to pediatricians, ‘Hey, I have this right,’” added Ms. Danielpour, who gives talks at conferences to physicians and health department officials.  
  
Elizabeth surreptitiously got her vaccine at a school pop-up clinic.  
  
After administrators at her boarding school informed parents they would be offering Covid shots, her mother gave permission. Her father forbade it. Upset, Elizabeth consulted the school nurse, who said she could not be vaccinated without approval from both. Elizabeth researched state laws, learning that she wasn’t old enough to consent on her own.  
  
She showed up anyway. At worst, she figured, the school would just turn her away.  
  
Apparently, they took note only of her mother’s consent. Saying nothing, Elizabeth stuck out her arm.  
  
Now she is in a pickle. The school is requiring students to be vaccinated for the fall semester and she says her father has begun warring with the administration over the issue. Elizabeth is afraid that if he learns how she was vaccinated, he will be furious and tell the school, which will discipline her for having deceived vaccinators, a stain on her record just as she is applying to college.  
  
Gregory D. Zimet, a psychologist and professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine, pointed out the irony of an adolescent being legally prevented from making a choice that was strenuously urged by public health officials. Developmentally, he said, adolescents at 14 and even younger are at least as good as adults at weighing the risks of a vaccine. “Which isn’t to say that adults are necessarily great at it,” he added.  
  
In many states, young teenagers can make decisions around contraception and sexually transmitted infections, which are, he noted, “in many ways more complex and fraught than getting a vaccine.”  
  
Pediatricians say that even parents who have themselves been vaccinated are wary for their children. Dr. Jay Lee, a family physician and chief medical officer of Share Our Selves, a community health network in Orange County, Calif., said parents say they would rather risk their child having Covid than get the new vaccine.  
  
“I will validate their concerns,” Dr. Lee said, “but I point out that waiting to see if your child gets sick is not a good strategy. And that no, Covid is not just like the flu.”  
  
Elise Yarnell, a senior clinic operations manager for the Portland, Ore., area at Providence, a large health care system, recalled a 16-year-old girl who showed up at a Covid vaccine clinic at her school in Yamhill County.  
  
Her parents oppose the vaccine so she wanted to get it without them knowing, which she could do legally because Oregon’s age of consent is 15. She teared up when she saw the shots were not ready before she had to be home, but she was able to return that night without alerting her parents and was vaccinated.  
  
“She was extremely relieved,” Ms. Yarnell said.  
  
Isabella is the 17-year-old daughter of Charisse, the Delray Beach, Fla., mother who refuses to grant permission for the vaccine. Asked why she wanted the shot, Isabella gave a stream of reasons. “A lot of older people in my family are at risk for catching Covid and possibly dying,” she said. “I want to get the vaccine so I can be around them, and they’ll be safe. And then I can go out with my friends again, and they won’t be so much at risk either.”  
  
Although doctors have been trying to instill vaccine confidence in parents as well as patients, there’s not much they can do when parents object. Recently, Dr. Mobeen H. Rathore, a pediatrics professor at the University of Florida medical college in Jacksonville, told a patient whose mother refused consent that she couldn’t get the Covid vaccine until she turned 18, three weeks hence.  
  
“She got vaccinated on her birthday,” Dr. Rathore said. “She sent me a message saying that was her birthday gift to herself.”

Most medical consent laws require parental permission for minors to get a vaccine. Now some places are easing restrictions for Covid shots while others are proposing new ones.  
  
When the mother of this Florida teenager blocked her from getting the Covid vaccine, the 15-year-old was uninvited to a friend’s party and continues to feel excluded from many social events because she remains unvaccinated.  
  
Teenagers keep all sorts of secrets from their parents. Drinking. Sex. Lousy grades.  
  
But the secret that Elizabeth, 17, a rising high-school senior from New York City, keeps from hers is new to the buffet of adolescent misdeeds. She doesn’t want her parents to know that she is vaccinated against Covid-19.  
  
Her divorced parents have equal say over her health care. Although her mother strongly favors the vaccine, her father angrily opposes it and has threatened to sue her mother if Elizabeth gets the shot. Elizabeth is keeping her secret not only from her father, but also her mother, so her mom can have plausible deniability. (Elizabeth asked to be identified only by her middle name.)  
  
The vaccination of children is crucial to achieving broad immunity to the coronavirus and returning to normal school and work routines. But though Covid vaccines have been authorized for children as young as 12, many parents, worried about side effects and frightened by the newness of the shots, have held off from permitting their children to get them.  
  
A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that only three in 10 parents of children between the ages of 12 through 17 intended to allow them to be vaccinated immediately. Many say they will wait for long-term safety data or the prod of a school mandate. But with many teenagers eager to get shots that they see as unlocking freedoms denied during the pandemic, tensions are crackling in homes in which parents are holding to a hard no.  
  
Forty states require parental consent for vaccination of minors under 18, and Nebraska sets the age at 19. (Some states carve out exemptions for teenagers who are homeless or emancipated.) Now, because of the Covid crisis, some states and cities are seeking to relax medical consent rules, emulating statutes that permit minors to obtain the HPV vaccine, which prevents some cancers caused by a sexually transmitted virus.  
  
Last fall, the District of Columbia Council voted to allow children as young as 11 to get recommended vaccines without parental consent. The New Jersey and New York legislatures have bills pending that would allow children as young as 14 to consent to vaccines; Minnesota has one that would permit some children as young as 12 to consent to Covid shots.  
  
But other states are marching in the opposite direction. Although South Carolina teenagers can consent at 16, and doctors may perform certain medically necessary procedures without parental permission on even younger children, a bill in the Legislature would explicitly bar providers from giving the Covid shot without parental consent to minors. In Oregon, where the age of medical consent is 15, Linn County ordered county-run clinics to obtain parental consent for the Covid shot for anyone under 18. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which has been tracking Covid-related bills, some states, including Tennessee and Alabama, are working on legislation to prevent public schools from requiring Covid shots.  
  
The issue of who can consent to the Covid shots is providing fresh context for decades-old legal, ethical and medical questions. When parents disagree, who is the arbiter? At what age are children capable of making their own health decisions and how should that be determined?  
  
“Isabella wants it because her friends are getting it, and she doesn’t want to wear a mask,” said Charisse, a mother of a 17-year-old in Delray Beach, Fla., who asked that her last name be withheld for family privacy. Charisse fears the shot could have an effect on her daughter’s reproductive system (a misperception that public health officials have repeatedly refuted).   
  
“Isabella said, ‘It’s my body.’ And I said, ‘Well, it’s my body until you’re 18.’”  
  
As both the legal debates and family arguments unfold, those administering the vaccine at pharmacies, clinics and medical offices are trying to determine how to proceed when a young teen shows up for the Covid shot without a parent.  
  
“We may be in a legal gray zone with this vaccine,” said Dr. Sterling Ransone Jr., a family physician in Deltaville, Va. In his health system, a parent can send a signed consent form for a teenager to be vaccinated. But because the Covid vaccine is authorized only for emergency use, the health system requires a parent to be present for a patient under 18 to get that shot.  
  
Marina, 15, who lives in Palm Beach County, Fla., — and who, like others interviewed, asked not to be fully identified — longs for the shot. But her mother says absolutely not. The subject is not open for discussion.  
  
And so Marina has been excluded from the social life she covets. “Five of my friends are throwing a party and they invited me, but then they said, ‘Are you vaccinated?’” she said. “So I can’t go. That hurts.”  
  
As the pandemic ebbs, some teen social circles are reconstituting based on vaccination status. “I see my friends posting on social media — ‘Woo-Hoo I got it!’ — and now when I see them, they ask me things like, ‘Where have you been? Are you traveling a lot? Are you sure you don’t have Covid?’ It sucks that I can’t get the shot,” Marina continued.

This is what the original posted article said. The article I posted also talks about a specific fungal infection that is normally harmless.


&gt;&gt;**Mucormycosis** is a very rare infection. It is caused by exposure to **mucor mould** which is commonly found in soil, plants, manure, and decaying fruits and vegetables. ""**It is ubiquitous and found in soil and air and even in the nose and mucus of healthy people,""**says Dr Nair.


.

&gt;The problem is over-prescribing steroids in cases where they are unnecessary / counterproductive, as in mild or early infections, where the immune system is doing useful work, and not yet doing harm to the body itself.


Well, that's what reassessing it's usage is, isn't it?


&gt;     

&gt;No, this is wrong. Corticosteroids have not “always” been used as temporary immunosuppressants for hypoxic Covid patients. They are used for a wide variety of medical purposes, with varying dosage, schedule, etc.


I mentioned all steroids being used as treatment as minimally as needed. Not just related to covid treatment.

If some of those other people are vaccinated that helps, but it doesn't stop anything.) 

I also know that a large fraction of the population needs to be vaccinated for a vaccination program to work. I don't know any reputable authority that thinks 40-50% is some kind of magic threshold where a highly transmissible disease will no longer spread.  Most people are talking 80 to 90% depending on how contagious the organism is. The Delta variant is about 2x as contagious as the Alpha variant, by the way.  Future variants may come along that are even worse as billions of people continue to incubate the virus over the next few years (though I sure hope not!). 

And of course, worldwide, the number of people who have been vaccinated to date is about 10 to 15%, and it will take several more years to make substantial progress on this.

&gt; Missouri is the state with the largest proportion of the Delta variant of Covid-19 infections, according to the CDC. And hospitals in the state are feeling the stress of managing Covid-19 patients on top of their regular intake, one hospital leader told CNN's Ana Cabrera on Thursday.

&gt; ""Both hospitals here in town are stretched,"" said Erik Frederick, chief administrative officer at Mercy Hospital Springfield in Springfield, Missouri.

&gt; ""We saw a very rapid escalation in our in-patient census starting June 1, we went from 26 to 90 in about three weeks. To go back to last year when our peak started, it took us six to seven weeks to escalate that quickly. Today to hit 97, it really took us almost two months to hit that level which we've done in under a month.""
Frederick said a return of typical hospital patients is exacerbating the issue.

&gt; ""The difference between last year and this we have traditional business back we didn't have last year during the initial surge. The demand for beds is higher for both Covid and non-Covid patients. It's definitely a stretch.""

&gt; Frederick said there is also a high amount of pressure on available labor.

A rapid antigen test for Covid-19 had been positive, and a lung scan had indicated viral pneumonia and the “possibility of Covid infection.”

But Shila Singh’s death hasn’t been counted among India’s Covid-19 toll.

India has officially recorded more than 390,000 coronavirus deaths, but families who have lost loved ones, health experts and statisticians say that vastly undercounts the true toll. Families like Mrs. Singh’s have been left struggling to get compensation that some states have set up for Covid-19 victims.


India’s undercount has also left a huge gap in the world’s understanding of the impact of the Delta variant, which health experts believe helped drive one of the world’s worst Covid-19 surges in April and May. India was the first to detect the highly infectious variant, which has hopscotched around the world. It is fueling a surge in the U.K., and is expected to become the dominant variant in the U.S.

An accurate count of Covid-19 infections and deaths is “a very important part of understanding how big a threat new variants are,” said Christopher Murray, director of the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

The institute’s modeling suggests the true Covid-19 death toll in India exceeds 1.1 million, close to three times the reported number. Dr. Murray estimates the scale of the undercount is similar to those in some countries in Latin America or Africa. He said the institute estimates India has detected only about 3% to 5% of all infections due to insufficient testing.

Murad Banaji, a mathematician at the Middlesex University in London who has been tracking the pandemic in India, estimates the country’s real death toll could be around five times the reported figure, based partly on mortality and serosurvey data, which shows the presence of antibodies in the population.

What’s your biggest takeaway from the latest Covid-19 outbreak in India? Join the conversation below.

The undercounting of infections and deaths is a problem world-wide, even in countries with widespread testing. The World Health Organization said last month that the global Covid-19 death toll could be two or three times the official number. The problem, however, is particularly acute in the developing world, where access to healthcare and coronavirus testing is often more limited.

Health experts point to a number of issues that have led to widespread undercounting in India. One is that hospitals were turning patients away in April and May as the rapid rise in cases overwhelmed the healthcare system. That left many people to die at home without being tested for Covid-19.

At the time Mrs. Singh tested positive, her family was under tremendous strain from the disease, according to her son, Neeraj Shekhar. He himself had tested positive five days earlier, and Mrs. Singh’s husband and two teenage grandchildren tested positive the same day that she did.

To qualify for its Covid-19 compensation payment of 400,000 rupees, equivalent to about $5,400, the state requires a report from a certified lab, which at the time were taking days to process. The family got a test strip from the lab indicating that Mrs. Singh was positive and rushed to a doctor.

The physician, Dr. N.P. Narain, said he ordered a CT scan and told the family to take Mrs. Singh to the hospital if her condition worsened. “At that time they probably didn’t think they would need all this proper documentation,” he said.


With multiple members of the family sick, Mrs. Singh’s condition deteriorated rapidly and she died five days after testing positive. The family could now use the state compensation to pay the nearly $1,300 in medical bills they racked up caring for family members with Covid-19, said Mr. Shekhar.

Health experts say many Covid-19 deaths have gone uncounted among India’s vast population of rural poor, who have little access to healthcare or Covid-19 testing. In the village of Sirondhan in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, for example, Vijay Pal Singh said his 38-year-old wife, Mithilesh Devi, fell ill last month with a fever and struggled to breathe. Mr. Singh said he took her to the village clinic and several hospitals in the district, but none had available beds or testing kits.

“She died at home, gasping for oxygen,” Mr. Singh said. Her death wasn’t included in the official Covid-19 tally, he added.

At least 30 people died in the village in late April and early May, many suffering from Covid-like symptoms, according to villagers and social workers. A further 47 died in two neighboring villages.


Villager Dharamvir Singh said one or two people died almost every day during the worst weeks of the second wave. He says he believes he and four members of his family were infected. No one was tested.

“The official numbers, at least for our village and a few others close to us, are totally wrong,” Mr. Singh said.

A senior official of the Uttar Pradesh government said there has been no underreporting of Covid-19 deaths, and that the state doesn’t plan to revise or update its official death tally.

Mr. Banaji, the mathematician, says the central government has tended to praise states with low death counts and castigate those with higher counts as incompetent. “This narrative of success and failure centered on fatality numbers is very dangerous,” he said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office didn’t respond to requests for comment. India’s health ministry said the government has regularly emphasized the need for robust systems to monitor and report cases and deaths in all districts.

Some states and cities in India have revised their death tolls after criticism by politicians and judges, but experts say the adjustments fall far short. In Maharashtra, home to the financial capital of Mumbai, a weekslong effort has added more than 8,000 deaths to the official tally. The capital city of New Delhi also revised its infection and death counts, increasing them by more than 44,000 and 700 respectively, in the midst of the second wave in April.

A recent investigation in the state of Bihar found nearly 4,000 more Covid-19 deaths, raising its toll by over 72%. They included deaths at home, as well as in private hospitals and from health complications related to Covid, said Dr. Sunil Kumar, the Bihar state secretary for the Indian Medical Association.


To have a death counted, families have to produce test results from a certified lab or confirmation of infection from the healthcare system—but often, like Mrs. Singh’s family, they don’t have the required paperwork. Dr. Kumar said he has treated patients who died after suffering from common Covid-19 symptoms, but because their families couldn’t produce a positive test the deaths weren’t included in the recent count.

(Since all EU countries get their vaccines in equal shares relative to their population size, these estimates can be used as a basis for estimates for other countries as well.)

**In light of Moderna's announcement this week that they will deliver more than anticipated in July, there are updated estimates from the German ministry for Health:**

For **July**, they expect 1.33 million doses of the **Moderna** vaccine per week (instead of the previous estimate of 733000 per week).

And apparently Germany expects to receive 2.57 millionen doses of **Moderna** per week in **August**, and 2.95 millionen per week in **September**. 

---

If these figures hold true, this would be a significant boost, as these numbers are on top of the sizeable Pfizer deliveries.

---

As noted before, there were no long-term predictions on J&amp;J (quality issues), and Astrazeneca (reliability issues). The German article linked above now claims that the German government has received deliveries that will allow them to distribute 5 million doses of Astrazeneca and 1 million doses of J&amp;J to the state governments next week.

TEL AVIV—About half of adults infected in an outbreak of the Delta variant of Covid-19 in Israel were fully inoculated with the Pfizer Inc. vaccine, prompting the government to reimpose an indoor mask requirement and other measures to contain the highly transmissible strain.

Preliminary findings by Israeli health officials suggest about 90% of new infections were likely caused by the Delta variant, according to Ran Balicer, who leads an expert advisory panel on Covid-19 for the government. Children under 16, most of whom haven’t been vaccinated, accounted for about half of those infected, he said.

The number of cases in Israel is relatively low by global standards. But new cases of Covid-19 rose to over 200 on Thursday from around 10 a day for most of June.
Israel is now reassessing its Covid-19 regulations after moving to open up its society and economy following multiple lockdowns last year.

“The entrance of the Delta variant has changed the transmission dynamics,” said Prof. Balicer, who is also the chief innovation officer for Israel’s largest health-management organization, Clalit.
The Delta variant, which first emerged in India in late 2020 and is also known as B.1.617.2, has now been detected in more than 70 countries. 

These so-called breakthrough cases—defined as positive Covid-19 test results received at least two weeks after patients receive their final vaccine dose—are broadly expected as the Pfizer vaccine is highly effective but not 100% foolproof, according to Mr. Balicer.

Israeli health officials are optimistic that even if the variant does spread, evidence from countries such as the U.K. indicate the vaccine will prevent a large increase in severe illness and hospitalizations that plagued the country’s health system in previous outbreaks. Israel has only recorded five severe cases in the past 10 days, Prof. Balicer said, but whether more will emerge is too early to tell.

Those exempt from the mask requirement included children under seven, people with disabilities that prevent them from wearing a mask or two workers who work regularly together. The government had canceled the indoor mask requirement 10 days ago and dropped most other preventive measures after running one of the world’s fastest vaccination campaigns. About 80% of Israelis of age 16 and above have received two doses of the vaccine that was developed by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE.

Israel was an early test case for the effectiveness of the vaccine after outbreaks last year at one point gave it one of the world’s highest per-capita infection rates. Since the start of the pandemic, 840,522 of the country’s 9.3 millions citizens have been infected, of which 6,429 died.

Israeli health officials said the highly contagious strain had likely entered the country through its main international airport, near Tel Aviv, where a system meant to vet every new arrival through testing was overloaded in recent days amid a surge in foreign travel.

On Wednesday, the government delayed allowing foreign nationals to enter into the country for tourism from July 1 to Aug. 1 and reimposed a mask requirement inside airports.

“Our goal at the moment, first and foremost, is to safeguard the citizens of Israel from the Delta variant that is running amok in the world,” Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Wednesday.",,,1624746003,{},h35gwsn,True,t3_o8k4zv,False,True,t3_o8k4zv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o8k4zv/delta_variant_outbreak_in_israel_infects_some/h35gwsn/,1625020253,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Straight up. Foaming at the mouths at even the *suggestion* of continued mask use. I was out shopping at a couple stores today in a denier-heavy area. Maybe 5% mask use. Almost no kids masked despite this current variant being more dangerous for kids and the fact that we still don't understand long-term covid damage. ""But kids don't die!"" Yeah, you could survive getting hit by a car too. You might also end up unable to walk the rest of your life. It's almost as if death isn't the only consequence.

It's pathetic. They're willfully ignoring the basics of how *any* virus works. Idk how the hell it's so hard to connect the dots (making up the numbers for sake of argument):

* Vaccine made, 95% effective
* Time passes, virus does what viruses do, and mutates
* Now the vaccine is 90% effective against new variants
* Time passes, virus mutates &lt;---- Where they stumble

After an undetermined amount of time we'd have a strain that the vaccine is only 85% effective against.. rinse and repeat until the vaccine is near useless or we hopefully develop a new vaccine.

It doesn't take more than half a brain cell to see that current vaccines won't remain as effective against all future strains. We can't just make a simple tweak to vaccines and get them into everyone's arms instantly. Shit takes time. 

Try to point this out and you get a bunch of jackasses saying, ""Oh studies say the vaccine is still pretty effective against current variants!"" Keyword there that they gloss over: CURRENT. The vaccines are effective but it might be a good idea to continue to reduce transmission so better vaccines can be made while current ones remain effective and before the virus gets a chance to mutate.

It's a piece of fucking cloth. God damn I wish I had the energy to get this pissy over something so petty. ""Oh I've sacrificed a year, woe is me"" We all fucking have. Suck it up.

Not everyone has been double vaccinated or had a chance yet, we shouldn't just ""I've got mine, screw everyone else"", otherwise how about if that line was drawn just ahead of you, and you were the one at risk?

Israel is an interesting choice - they've just reversed their position on masks due to Delta.  I don't think they're finding it insignificant.

I'll let the far more informed scientists lead the way on when we're out of the woods.  Nobody expects it to all go away, but enough resistance in the country as a whole, and a communal build up of resistance means we get on top of it, much like other novel viruses.  Giving up before we're ready invalidates the point of treating it at all.  By that measure, we should have ""let the bodies pile high"" as Johnson wanted.  Let that ring for a moment, our peacetime PM wanted our friends and families to be decimated.

How many have you lost to Covid?  I've lost a friend and a colleague, 2 young families fatherless now.  It's a nasty nasty disease.

Singapore is one of the most socially compliant countries on earth, and I remember the mask wearing during Bird Flu there in the past.  Very different population characteristics than Western Europe.  Of course they know all along it's here to stay, so they are taking measures that fit their population as they know social compliance will make them effective.

It makes me frustrated that most medical professionals don't explain this to everybody, or that it is not legally required to study/disclose.  During the pandemic, I think a ton of people have now been clued into these kinds of subtleties that have been widely ignored up until now.  

To be explicit, for every single vaccine, if you finish the ""normal prescribed vaccine regiment"", there is a certain percentage of people that are not yet protected.  And in SOME of those cases, another shot of the identical vaccine at some later date would improve the chances of you being protected by some amount.  And in some smaller set of cases, they can test to see if you are immune.

Here is an example of this pet peeve of mine in action: The regular yearly flu vaccine is 40% - 60% effective and the 60% is if they guess the ""strains"" correctly that year.  It goes as low as 13% effective if they guess the strains incorrectly like occurred in 2014-2015 flu season when multiple strains of H3N2 made people sick.  Now here is my question that I am yet to find an answer: if I got the yearly flu vaccination, then waited 6 weeks, then got the same vaccination AGAIN, would it: A) cause me some side effects I don't want, B) do nothing, or C) decrease my chances of getting the flu that year?  I cannot find the answer anywhere.  I've asked several doctors, they don't know.  I can't find anything online about it.

Here is just a little more information: there is a different flu vaccine formulation for people over 65 years old.  You can google ""Fluzone High Dose"", and the difference is it contains four times (!!!!) the amount of antigen (the inactivated virus that promotes the immune response).  For people older than 65, this results in them getting the flu an ASTOUNDING 24% less of the time!  Now stay with me here: which one should you get if you are say 63 years old and all your life you tended to have weaker responses to things like the hepatitis B vaccine?  I honestly have no idea. 

I am kind of excited by the new mRNA technology being applied to the flu vaccination.  There are some article floating about with some bold claims that may or may not come true like an mRNA flu vaccine will last multiple years and be much more effective than the current flu vaccine.

What most people seem to fail to understand about infections is that it’s a probability game: Even if both, you and the person next to you wear a mask, if the person next to you is spreading the virus, you could end up infected - it’s just very unlikely. Adding just a little distance significantly reduces the probability. One person removing the mask increases the probability, both removing the mask increases it a lot more. Having a healthy immune system decreases the probability.

If the person spreading it only spreads a very low dose (i.e. contagious phase is almost over), your immune system may prevent an infection within you even noticing (or becoming contagious yourself).

I think the answer is that for some reason communicable disease causes a lot more hysteria, and public health authorities are tuned into this. Same with terrorism, which causes relatively few deaths, yet countries spend enormous amounts to fight it. The opioid epidemic has killed about half a million Americans, but the response is just some mild lawsuits against the companies that know full well that most of their products hit the black market. Nosocomial infections kill 100k Americans every year, despite it being preventable. Non-communicable disease kills far and away more than anything else, but there’s no effort to tax sugar or remove escalators to promote exercise, etc.  Yet for COVID19 we’re willing to drastically limit freedoms, shut down businesses, obligate mask wearing, and spend more money than all of WWII (in constant dollars). The contrast is pretty striking for a disease that mostly hits people near the end of their lives. eg the opioid epidemic + obesity has had a much bigger impact of American life expectancy than COVID19, which makes the US the only developed country in the world to see its life expectancy flattened or even dropping starting around 2014.

Yes, exactly, I think that's why the CDC's message that social distancing and other measures can now be abandoned was such a huge error.

That was a real accomplishment, saved a lot of lives, and was not something to be abandoned lightly.  The CDC announcement is already starting to look premature, and the WHO yesterday backed away from this and advised continued masking and social distancing for everyone (another flip-flop!).  Cases in the UK now are doubling every week, the classic exponential growth pattern.

[A quote from a news article:](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2021/06/2aecc1f0b152-japans-top-covid-adviser-says-not-normal-for-olympics-to-be-held.html)

“Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has insisted the Olympics and Paralympics can be held safely, regardless of the infection situation in the country and without specifying how to achieve that goal. His lack of explanation for why the Olympics have to take place has drawn public criticism.”

It is suspected that PM Suga believe the Olympics will give him a better chance at keeping his job. Why he believes so when the public opinion is very negative about holding the games this year,  I don’t understand personally. But that’s how the experts think. For example, [Foreign Policy has an article titled “Suga’s Olympics-Sized Gamble.”](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/06/22/tokyo-summer-olympics-suga-covid-19-pandemic/)

Any voice casting doubt about whether the games should really go ahead, is bad for Suga and the like-minded.

I’m sure Indians aren’t pushing their faces into dirt, or all cases being from home/factory growers working with soil.

I haven’t heard or read anything related to this. Mild cases wouldn’t be hospitalized, would they? 



&gt;	and there are few effective treatments known. 


Well yes, it has been this way for 18 months now. Some meds helped while others don’t. I’m pretty sure doctors worldwide are reassessing that specific treatment. 



&gt;	The problem is that steroids given in that case don’t help much and can be harmful (hurt the body’s efforts to fight off Covid, as well as make it vulnerable to other pathogens like fungi).


This is what I said, and what the article said as well.

Continuing to administer these vaccines could be considered irresponsible given the availability of other vaccines without those risks.

There’s historical precedent for relatively rare conditions leading to a vaccination halt:

“In 1976, concerns in the United States about a possible influenza pandemic involving a virus similar to the deadly 1918 pandemic strain resulted in a large-scale vaccination program for the entire country. Approximately 45 million people were vaccinated in 10 weeks with what became known as the “swine flu vaccine” [16]. The US government abruptly stopped the vaccination program when no swine flu cases were detected outside the military base where the disease originated and when an unexpectedly high number of cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome were reported in vaccinated individuals. The vaccine was estimated to have caused approximately one Guillain-Barré syndrome case per 100,000 persons vaccinated [17], resulting in 53 deaths [18].”

“Guillain-Barre (gee-YAH-buh-RAY) syndrome is a rare disorder in which your body's immune system attacks your nerves. Weakness and tingling in your extremities are usually the first symptoms.

Studies confirm that many, if not most, Covid-19 patients say their sense of smell is affected -- a condition called anosmia or hyposmia. Because smell and taste are closely linked, many people feel their ability to taste food normally is also affected when their sense of smell is disrupted.  
Nearly every new Covid-19 death is now entirely preventable, CDC director says  
An ongoing experiment of about 100 people who lost their sense of smell in early 2020 showed it can take months for it to come back, but it does. Some patients didn't realize or appreciate it, however, the international team of researchers reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association's JAMA Network Open.  
""At eight months, objective olfactory assessment confirmed full recovery in 49 of 51 patients (96.1%),"" they wrote. Two continued to have an abnormal sense of smell a year later -- one who couldn't smell much and another who had an abnormal smell sense.  
""Our findings suggest that an additional 10% gain in recovery can be expected at 12 months, compared with studies with 6 months of follow-up that found only 85.9% of patients with recovery,"" they wrote.",,,1624825037,{},h38w9pg,False,t3_o89dy8,False,True,t1_h35mpxz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o89dy8/some_fully_vaccinated_people_may_still_get_sick/h38w9pg/,1625088262,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This person has covid. Below that person are three branches leading to three other people that person spreads covid to. Below those three people are three more branches each that they all spread covid to. And below those nine people are another three each, and so on and so on. This is how covid spreads without vaccines. Each person infecting 3 more until this tree includes everybody in a population. Picturing this tree. It's massive. It goes a long way down and branches out very far and wide. 

Now, imagine that half of those people are vaccinated and don't catch or spread it. Imagine the vaccinated people are randomly distributed through this tree. Every person below the vaccinated ones in this tree don't catch it because the person who would have given it to them didn't get it. If someone who happens to be near the top of that tree gets vaccinated, they could end up sparing literally thousands of people far down that tree from getting it too. 

This is also why even vaccinating just half of a population reduces infections by more than half. Because you're not just reducing a person's chance of infection, if that person doesn't get infected, then the people they would have spread it to also don't get infected, and the people they would have spread it to don't get infected, and so on. 

That's why we're in a much better spot that it might initially seem, even though vaccinations aren't as good as they could be. And of course, spread doesn't occur as simply as I've described it, people don't have just one opportunity to catch covid, and vaccinated people aren't evenly distributed throughout the US population, but the principle is still there.

If herd immunity can only be hit with +80% vaccination rates, then there is really a chance for some countries to never get out of covid spread.

Abdala is definitely breaking some new ground with their tech and the interim results from Cuba are promising. But its also not going to be a magic bullet (like pfizer or moderna) by any stretch. Abdala is a 3 dose vaccine with the third dose on the 28th day after the first dose. Efficacy also is measured from 14 days from the final dose. The longer vaccination timeline is a huge challenge, both in terms of getting people back for two doses and in terms of logistics.

Thanks for understanding. I really am trying to stay positive. I moved out of mom and Dad’s a couple years back when I got married and we had a little bit of emergency fund in case something bad happened. 6 months into marriage my wife had to have her gallbladder removed and the medical bills basically wiped out our savings and we’re still paying expenses to this day. 6 months after that we lost our jobs to COVID and had to start from square one yet again. We’ve also had to have our cars repaired multiple times over the course of the past year, and had to scrounge money to pay for the repairs. I recently pre-paid next months rent with money I saved up through my Qapital savings app, so we could have some peace of mind until the first of August. 

People are definitely suffering way more than us and I don’t want to ignore the blessings I have. It’s just not fun when you’re living paycheck to paycheck, and constantly waiting for something else to go wrong. 

In the mean time to make ends meet I’ve been  working at Amazon over the past year. But even then I signed on as a temp and my contract expires at the end of July. 

So I’m praying I can get my job back before that happens.

Also, there were studies here in Germany according to which neither schools, nor restaurants, nor movie theatres had any significant spreading events (on the other hand, schools do seem to currently be a major issue in the UK, so just because it’s not an issue in one study in one area at one time doesn’t mean it cannot become a problem later).

But then people interpret the recommendation as masks don't work. Because of 1 stupid study which had summary conclusions which didn't match the methods. Perhaps they should have recommended cloth masks initially, but then you may still have a run on N95s. They eventually settled for logistics control - confiscate horded PPE, bar N95s from Amazon, etc and then came out with reasonable masking recommendations.

Not easy decisions.

Then we do have political and monetary influences - pushing expensive patented treatments like Remdesivir and downplaying effectiveness of alternative treatments like HCQ or Ivermectin. While also making stock market investments.

Compound with cut corners, albeit a necessity to reduce total deaths, on vaccine safety testing. Rat studies and cancer patient studies do show some harm from LNP, but it's lower risk than the disease, and so here we are.

eh, I don't think survivor bias is really it, more like those that either never got infected with influenza or those that their immune system is too weak to fight it off. Influenza would be extremely dangerous if a novel pandemic strain popped up, entirely possible to be far worse than covid, but covid being a clotting/blood disease means it attacks the body differently from flu. It being worse in older people could be a function of multiple factors, some of which will be survivor bias, some will be immune response to influenza, and some will be the fact that your heart and lungs naturally get weaker as you get older, and a disease which causes blood clotting and attacks the cardiovascular system has the possibility to be much more severe than one that hits primarily the respiratory system. 

&gt; As for covid, nobody has immunity, so impact is greater for more vulnerable people.

That's not true. Covid some some cross-reactivity with antibodies from OG SARS/MERS, as well as a couple of the milder corona virus strains that circulate every couple years. Your immune response isn't as strong against covid as it is flu, but it's incorrect to say no one had immunity or working antibodies to it prior to the start of the pandemic. 

&gt;  older people today have more immunity against flu

Yes, this is true, however in the populations that covid hits hardest influenza is not even remotely close to it. Like, we're talking covid is several orders of magnitude more deadly in the 65+ range given that influenza is like, .8% at that age range and covid is something like 25%+

Apparently the best thing to do with Coronavirus is to vaccinate everybody overnight, so the existing virus population has nowhere to go and  also no opportunities to mutate.  The worst thing to do is to have a very slow rolling vaccination program, so that there's a large ongoing population of people who can breed different variants of the virus that can then try to replicate in vaccinated people.

[],,permabannerbabeee,,,[],,,,text,t2_bnklt8ng,False,False,[],"I held out getting my FIRST dose until June. I waited until a blood antibody test became readily available- and when it was negative, went to get the vaccine.

I had been fully vaccinated for everything else as a child, but hadn't had a vaccine in the past ten years or so after receiving HPV vax in 9th grade, but then again- that just means that I don't get flu shots. 

I had never thought twice about vaccines before, I just thought everyone got them, but I'm not planning on getting my second dose. 

1st dose efficacy is something like 50-60% after two weeks, and I feel confident with that level of protection, that either I won't be infected or I'll be infected less severely, and being fairly healthy otherwise, I've never been afraid of being infected naturally in the first place. I'm still holding out for some tiny level of natural immunity if its at all possible, but even if I only have vaccine immunity, I feel pretty okay with that.

We have to be honest with folks about the risks. Yes, you probably won’t die from Covid. But get the vaccine to protect grandma. Do it to avoid a real risk of long term effects. And — though you probably won’t die from Covid — it’s a nearly free way to eliminate the risk.

Not even choosing the extreme opposites, like Vermont and Mississippi, which have a 35% difference in fully vaccinated population, there's definitely a bit of a difference. Even between California(~49% fully vaccinated) and Georgia(~35%), that's a big gap. 

And the gap is even more noticeable when you look at the single doses distributed. 60% of California is at least partially vaccinated, versus 42% of Georgia.


And the concerning thing is that the vaccination distribution is very divided by 2020 party lines, with some exceptions. That tells me that it's very unlikely an FDA approval will sway a significant number of people in those states, whereas it might bring the numbers up a bit in the other states.

Wait for multivalent mRNA boosters if you really feel that you need additional protection.

Novavax is highly effective and uses an older vaccine technology. This should be promoted as the vaccine for people who think mRNA is too new a technology for them to get. It can't come soon enough.

Still totally worth checking out if you haven't already. Hasn't gone out of date yet. 

[Original Comment 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mnzwri/daily_discussion_thread_april_10_2021/gu200jr/) - Additional stuff, thoughts. Much less worth checking out, but there are a few things in there that are still good. 

***

The vaccines are FREE in the US.  FREE FREE, not like ""Copay free"", like fuckin FREE. You don't need insurance. Go get one. Now.  Is there something stopping you from going to get one today? Talk to me about it, we'll get it worked out.  

If your doctor offers to give you the vaccine, take it, right away. It *will be absolutely free*. If you get a bill for the vaccine, call the cops or something, [it's *ILLEGAL* to charge you for the vaccine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nvzofq/government_warns_doctors_and_insurers_dont_bill/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

[Dose intervals might increase efficacy if extended past 3 or 4 weeks,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/mudvjd/questin_about_vaccine_intervals/gv58byt/) CDC says you have up to 42 days between doses (but that may be extended at some point).

**More variant stuff:**

Please don't say ""strain"" when you mean ""variant"". 

There [might not be much room left for SARS-CoV-2 to mutate](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/mpcc5k/weekly_question_thread_april_12_2021/gui5xn3/) into.

CDC [doesn't think](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n94zxm/no_evidence_that_pfizer_vaccine_needs_updating/) we'll need boosters/updates/etc for the mRNA vaccines.

Pfizer/Moderna work on the [Double/Triple/Indian Variant](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/n9q3q8/infection_and_vaccineinduced_neutralizing/).

Pfizer (and Moderna, probably) [works on B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 Variants](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/n5r2ry/effectiveness_of_the_bnt162b2_covid19_vaccine/)

T-Cells are really important.  Probably [more important than antibodies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/n5015i/highly_functional_cellular_immunity_in_sarscov2/)

Moderna works great against variants, even [seven months out from the second dose.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ne0wx8/durability_of_mrna1273induced_antibodies_against/)

**The vaccine is better than the disease:**

[Penis issues from Covid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nbh3ez/covid19_endothelial_dysfunction_can_cause/) (but [not the vaccine\).](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/narbhn/researchers_report_covid19_found_in_penile_tissue/)

[Neurological problems](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/na1eri/82_of_people_hospitalized_with_covid19_develop/) from Covid Infection (but not the vaccine).

[Loss of smell](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n88qwv/daily_discussion_thread_may_09_2021/gxiiusd/) is both [common](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6sj6g/daily_discussion_thread_may_07_2021/gxb6wah/) and way [more devastating](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n1efrf/joe_rogan_walks_back_antivaccination_comments/gwcvd0m/) than you'd think.  This does not occur with the vaccines.

Loss of smell [really sucks.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nqkiz5/cdc_touts_smell_training_after_covid19_but_it/) There's a whole subreddit about it ([anosmia](https://www.reddit.com/r/anosmia/comments/nkcta1/3_months_and_minimal_recovery/)), and the people who didn't lose their sense of smell from Covid are tired of everyone asking Covid-loss-of-smell questions.  

[Fewer symptoms = less spread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6sj6g/daily_discussion_thread_may_07_2021/gxbfbt1/)  Vaccines make you have fewer symptoms (*if* you get an infection after vaccination).

If you got infected, recovered, and then got at least one dose of Pfizer, you have immunity not only to multiple variants, but also SARS-CoV-1, the virus for which we named SARS in 2003.  Turns out much of [the ""breadth"" of that immunity is from the vaccine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/net65c/sarscov2_mrna_vaccines_induce_a_greater_array_of/)

[Truly asymptomatic people don't spread the virus much.  People who are pre-symptomatic, and do go on to have symptoms, can be really good spreaders.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ncsstr/daily_discussion_thread_may_15_2021/gy7idau/)

I also think that comparing covid to flu is sort of a hopeless comparison. Flu is more dangerous for children ~ 16 and younger, while covid is more dangerous for everyone else. The biggest difference however is that covid is probably around 5-6x more contagious/infectious than the flu is, so even in the younger ages covid is going to kill more people because it's just going to infect more. 

Also, covid is sort of a weird disease in that the initial strain was relatively mild compared to others in a similar profile (SARS, MERS, etc) but it was waaaaay more contagious. This lead me to believe last June when I was thinking about it, that covid was likely to evolve to be more dangerous/deadly rather than evolving to be less dangerous/deadly like many diseases do. The reason being that most diseases that are deadly, start out too deadly to people, and it causes the disease to die out too quickly. For covid however, that is already airborne, the limiting factor in spreading is actually how sick it makes people since even though it can spread from asymptomatic individuals it does not spread nearly as well as those who get sick and cough/sneeze/etc. 

This was, and is, still my biggest reason against opening up schools for in-person classes until there is a vaccine available for the age groups. If your biggest vector for the virus is a population that was relatively insulated previously (in this case, young kids) becomes the only reliable, wide-spread transmission vector, then the virus is going to evolve such that the strains that spread most efficiently in that group are the ones that will take dominance and spread. It's an insanely stupid thing to do because it's going to put a bunch of kids at risk. It's entirely possible we get the vaccine rolled out before it becomes seriously dangerous for the younger age groups, but why take that bet when losing it has such serious consequences.",,,1624744177,{},h35dk38,False,t3_o89dy8,False,False,t1_h34hqfe,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o89dy8/some_fully_vaccinated_people_may_still_get_sick/h35dk38/,1625018377,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;Among over 550,000 residential households in the UK between January to March 2021, the overall SARS-CoV-2 secondary attack rate was 5.7% in household where the index case had received at least one dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca and 6.3% in households where the index case had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine more than 21 days before testing positive. By contrast, the overall secondary attack rate in households with unvaccinated index cases was 10%

We may ""need to"" lock down many more times, but it will never happen.  No Republican governor will ever agree to it, and lockdowns won't work in the states with Democratic governors if their neighbors aren't doing them too.

The CDC took the (I think) rather sensible position of saying that if you are vaccinated, certain things (almost everything) are safe, masked or unmasked.  The data supports this.  The mRNA vaccines, in particular, are still ~90% effective at preventing any symptoms at all for the delta variant), 96% effective at preventing hospitalization, and even better than that at preventing death.  The case fatality rate in the UK for the delta variant is 0.1%.  Fauci, Osterholm, Gottlieb, Jha have all said the CDC's decision was the right call.

The CDC made it an individual choice, which is sort of the only option once people decided against vaccine passports/mandatory vaccination (which are a much smaller infringement upon our rights than lockdowns, might I add!).  Those who are at risk and cannot be vaccinated can and should continue to take precautions.    N95s are readily available  Cases right now are more than 10x lower than they were last fall, and while this is expected to rise, it will help protect some of the people who cannot be vaccinated.

I have a PhD in Biology, so if you want to play credentialism games, I'm actually more qualified to comment than most, probably including you.

I don't know what to tell you. Here is the data showing the pfizer vaccine has 88% efficacy against the Delta variant: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.22.21257658v1. That's only a single digit percentage decrease from COVID Classic.

And guess what? Other agencies, also staffed with biology PhDs, MDs and epidemeologists (like the CDC), are not saying this. Expert agreement isn't always 100%, so making an appeal to authority isn't a great argument.

Tell me, what is the point of having vaccines that are 88% effective, and 96% effective against serious hospitalization and death, if you can't get back to normal? 

Not to mention this article was talking about Russia which has an abysmal vaccination rate and with a second-rate vaccine, so yes, they will need more than vaccines (in the short term) because there's no way they can get their numbers up in time.

&gt;Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or have no symptoms at all. However, some children can get severely ill from COVID-19. They might require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe. In rare cases, they might die.


&gt;CDC and partners are investigating a rare but serious medical condition associated with COVID-19 in children called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). We do not yet know what causes MIS-C and who is at increased risk for developing it. Learn more about [MIS-C](https://www.cdc.gov/mis/mis-c.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fdaily-life-coping%2Fchildren%2Fmis-c.html).",,,1624826974,{},h3908ld,False,t3_o8zbx5,False,False,t1_h38sx8h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o8zbx5/the_threat_of_the_delta_variant_looms_large_in/h3908ld/,1625090457,19,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The thing is, Americans at the low end of income earn a lot more in terms of purchasing power than the same Americans, say, 100 years ago. An American in the 75th percentile earns a lot more than, say, a Portuguese in the same percentile. The deference is that low income Americans have lost a cultural memory of how to feed themselves - less so in other countries. These folks couldn’t even tell a turnip from a sweet potato, much less what to do with one. I live in Asia where low income folks buy cheap produce at wet markets. There must be well over 50 different cabbages, mushrooms, tubers, and fruits. People can’t afford beef, but they know how to work with cheaper ingredients. I’m also struck by the way American cooks at cheap eats have such a limited skill level. It’s mostly short-order burgers, fried eggs, BLTs, etc - things that anyone could learn in an afternoon. Whereas Portuguese cheap eats have variety and complexity and regional styles typical for each cook. The skill level is much higher, which reflects a population that is more skilled overall regardless of income. The “food deserts” in low income American neighbourhoods are due to a lack of demand, not an inability to supply. 

To be clear: obesity is a universal problem, with countries like the UK only 5 years “behind” the US. And plenty of sugar-rich countries are worse off than the US (eg México, Kuwait, Indonesia, Fiji, etc).
