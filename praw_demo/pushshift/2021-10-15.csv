Please try to keep your facts straight.  You can argue a glass is half empty or argue that it is half full.  Could be neither is a lie or incorrect for a given glass.  If we are talking about the same glass and you claim it is dry or claim that it is overflowing then the facts are wrong.  No one has to concede to the opposition on a point about  the glass since we can haggle about reading from the top or bottom of the meniscus.  We can always flip the tables and argue that the excess emptiness is proof that it needs more filling or counter argue that it has not been emptied enough yet. 

[This article](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vaccinated-people-are-less-likely-spread-covid-new-research-finds-n1280583), for example, says Pfizer vaccine reduced breakthrough transmission by 65% when the vaccine was Pfizer and the variant was Delta.  That is still failing altogether 35% of the time.  You can make the point that you were trying to make using that data point.  I have seen many similar data points from other studies.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;...especially several months down the road when your antibodies have waned. ...

This add on would sound much stronger if it followed the accurate science.  ""Pfizer vaccine failed to prevent transmission 35% of the time in relatively fresh vaccinations.""  

&gt;...Seems to me like imperfect circumstances are being met with absolute punishment in an effort to salvage arguably the biggest blunder since 9/11, if you can even call it a blunder....

I am not on the ground in France.  My impression was that the choices were to shut down everything or to open for vaccinated and tested.  France is not properly French without the cafes and crepes.  Losing the cafes and degrading into what looks like an American city was the punishment to horrible to consider. 

The price of the crepes still reflects the cost of providing it.  Now France has enough vaccines to be easy access.  If you want crepes and do not want to get vaccinated you pay for a test.  Unvaccinated French can still wander around like tourists and see that they are still in France.

[],,MUCTXLOSL,,,[],,,,text,t2_9zbki,False,False,[],"&gt;Unvaccinated individuals that make sure to follow all protective measures or individuals who've recovered from a previous infection spread the virus at a higher rate than vaccinated individuals who walk around pretending there's a higher chance of getting hit by a bus than getting sick? Do you perhaps have a source to back that up?

No. Unvaccinated individuals who wash their hands, wear their mask and social distance whenever possible spread more of the virus than vaccinated individuals who wash their hands, wear their mask and social distance whenever possible. Once we're done with forcing the unvaccinated to become vaccinated, we'll all go to concerts together, with clean hands and without masks. 

&gt;The argument is what difference does it make if I get vaccinated when there's a good chance of more setbacks? Would it be unwise to wait for updated vaccines, if not for better protection then at least for analysis and mitigation of adverse effects?

Yes, that would be unwise, because it would take decades to get data that is slightly more reliable than the data that's available today and perfectly reliable enough. 
And: the chance for setbacks is lower if you GET THE FREAKING SHOT instead of arguing. Is that actually hard to grasp? 

&gt;I'm not denying that your health is better protected, but seeing as vaccinated individuals are not actually immune in the same way non-smokers are, your health as a vaccinated individual is not protected to the extent that it is when smokers are obliged to smoke outside. So in that sense, a law prohibiting unvaccinated people from entering certain establishments - while technically democratic - can very well be undemocratic.

You made no point as to how it is undemocratic. You simply (for no logical reason) still don't like it. 
And why do you expect ""actually immune""? Why isn't, quote, ""your health is better protected"" good enough? You know... You can still get lung cancer, even if you don't smoke. So ""wHY NoT JuSt smOKe?"" 


&gt;The sole reason? Did you suddenly forget that vaccinated individuals can get sick and spread the virus, especially if they behave as though they can't?

I said several times that vaccinated people still can get sick, but at a much lower rate. They can still die, but the chance of it hsppening is much lower. And behaving like we can't get sick anymore is our goal, even though we know that from now on we always can get sick with covid, we just want to better our chances. 
Sidenote: how many antivaxxers are pro maks, and how many vaccers are contra mask? Your argument doesn't make sense, no matter how hard I try to make it do so. 


&gt;I'd think a return to normalcy is entirely possible without coercing people into getting a vaccine whose efficacy vs delta is compromised and whose clinical trials are to be completed no sooner than December of 2022.

We don't need clinical trials anymore, we got hundreds of millions of actual shots. Compromised, slightly, but much, much, much, much, much, much better than the alternative. How in the name of the non-existing god can you believe that that's a good argument? 

&gt;Gladly, so long as everything going on actually makes sense.

The core of every conspiracy theory: ""as long as your science-based solution doesn't explain every freaking thing, I'd rather believe in the made up bullshit somebody told me so he could get some fame"". 

&gt;Right, so you got vaccinated because you'd rather not harm your postman's neighbor's grandmother. Remind me to applaud you if you get sick despite being vaccinated.

I'll tell the people who are busy with externally enrichening your blood with oxygen to applaude me when I'm standing in front of your field hospital with a slight cough ;)

This can be preempted nationally.  Just do not allow any planes to enter U.S airspace with unvaccinated/untested passengers.  Airline employees can strike all they want and it will not ground the planes any more than when they are already grounded.  The local hospital could just park an ambulance on the runway.  

Individually packaged sterile swab cast $0.20.  We could very easily test the entire flight with one PCR test.  That is less than a dollar per passenger total.

The data on third doses for pfizer is overwhelmingly good.  [Israel real-world data](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.07.21264626v1) shows at least a 5x, and possibly 10-20x, reduction in infection after the third dose (cases in Israel have also dropped nearly to zero since they gave half the population a third dose).  For Moderna it's a bit tighter; antibody boost is very significant after the third dose and likely to bring efficacy up to ~95% against Delta, but efficacy might already be 80-90% so that isn't as huge of an improvement.

The fear of waning is misplaced. But this actually makes third doses look even better: the level of protection against both infection and hospitalization they give is really, really high.  As the amount of data we have continues to accumulate it's nearly certain that public messaging on this will change and everyone will be told to get a third dose.

&gt; Also, i am in a school setting 24/7, should I also get the booster?

Go to university and get a degree before you attempt to opine on academic research.

This research was peer reviewed and published in JAMA Open Network, a journal with an impact factor in the top 3% of all journals and one of premiere‚Äîif not the premiere‚Äîopen access medical journals in the world. It's a serious journal that will only publish significant papers.

You can read the actual study here:

One bit immediately jumps out at me,

&gt; From a total of 2100 studies identified, 57 studies with 250‚ÄØ351 survivors of COVID-19 met inclusion criteria.

So, they did a meta review, found 2100 studies and identified 57 which were high enough quality to include in their analysis. Those studies had data on over a **quarter-million subjects**.

You're balking because only 21% of the subjects were hospitalized?  That's more than 50,000 data points. I am literally at a loss for what more you could possibly want.

You want them to do a double-blind clinical trial on this? I suspect that may have issues getting approved by an ethics board anywhere...

[],,Xolver,,,[],,,,text,t2_xlxyh,False,False,[],"&gt;Vaccines do not make you sick. This is a fundamental difference, and why vaccination always strengthens your immune system - even against other diseases. Disease might do that as well, but it can absolutely also weaken you. Not being strengthened (against a certain disease in the case of infection) is also not the same thing as being weakened, though.

I wasn't saying vaccines make you sick (although they do make many people have sickness-like symptoms, but it's not an interesting enough point in my book to argue). I was just arguing that the fact that boosters are a thing, is evidence to immunity waning which in my book *I did* read as similar to immune system weakening. I understand that you might technically be correct - that is, that your *overall* immune system is hit (even if temporarily) when fighting disease, while a *specific* immunity rises. I didn't think of the nuance before, and I think most people are along the same lines. They (we) ask ""practically, do I have more or less of a chance of getting a serious disease if I didn't get it before for a longer period of time?"" And since we are talking about a very finite list, ie types of influenzas, RSVs, Covid, and maybe a few other things that are ""around"" - the immune system is *effectively* weaker without prolonged exposure. Especially for kids.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The MIT article you link clearly claims at the top that your immune system is not weakened by social distancing.

Yep, and then goes on to say *apparently* contradictory things. Don't worry, this isn't one of those internet debates where both people see the same evidence and reach apparently opposite conclusions due to cognitive dissonance or whatnot. I concede that there's a difference between immunity and the immune system. I *do not concede* that that is what people usually mean when they ask about their or their children's chances of getting such and such disease more severely.

*The article also talks about the difference between kids and adults, the importance of exposure as kids, and also the immune system as a whole weakening due to social distancing etc. which is very important on one hand for some people to notice, but again not what I was arguing on the other, so I'm letting that go as well because I sure as heck don't know enough to say when the imbalance from social distancing is enough to be more hurtful than physically contracting disease.*",,,,1634366614,{},hgu18yj,False,t3_q8ugoy,False,True,t1_hgty1r1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q8ugoy/colorado_hospital_sees_historic_pediatric/hgu18yj/,1634497888.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,jdorje,,,[],,,,text,t2_ii7rl,False,False,[],"You do make sense, and this is possible: that in a normal year you'd be exposed to RSV constantly, and catch it once immunity dropped below a certain point, and it would be mild.  But in this year you had no RSV exposure for 12 months and so your immunity to that disease was lower when you did catch it and the disease was more severe.  But on the other hand, you have had less total RSV infections so the overall disease burden might be lower.

Immunity waning is not the same as immune system being weakened though.

There's potentially another thing going on, in that most diseases are less severe if you catch them at a younger age (up to a point) than if you wait.  Chickenpox (pre-vaccine) is the prime example of this: we used to intentionally infect kids when they hit the right age (5) so that they wouldn't catch it later.  If we didn't have a vaccine, COVID would absolutely fall into this category also.

&gt; Other contradictory evidence is literally every country that now recommends boosters. 

Vaccines do not make you sick.  This is a fundamental difference, and why vaccination always strengthens your immune system - even against other diseases.  Disease might do that as well, but it can absolutely also weaken you.  Not being strengthened (against a certain disease in the case of infection) is also not the same thing as being weakened, though.

A little more than half of vaccinations in the USA have been Pfizer.

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends\_dailycases\_totalvaccinesadministered|New\_case|Administered\_Cumulative](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailycases_totalvaccinesadministered|New_case|Administered_Cumulative)

About 220million doses had been given 6 months ago vs 406 million now, so a bit more than half of doses had been given out more than 6 months ago. Of course some of those people in the last few weeks were getting their first dose, and don't quite qualify for their booster yet.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm)

About 70-75% of adults in the US have a BMI &gt;25. Add in occupation, age, and other risk factors and more than 75% of people meet the requirements to qualify for Pfizer boosters.

&amp;#x200B;

.56\*.5\*.5\*.75 = .105 or 10.5%.  Then you have perhaps another 1-2% fully vaccinated people who qualify for 3rd shots for Moderna/J&amp;J because they are immunocompromised. And a hopefully insignificant percent of Pfizer people who qualify for boosters because they are immunocompromised and unfortunately not 6 months out from their 2nd dose.

Although they're very rough numbers, I'd have a hard time believing less than 10% of people qualify for boosters/extended series doses given rounding down each number gives 10.5% without even including the Moderna/J&amp;J people who already qualify before the expected approval of more widespread extra doses.

It's not that you get exposed to something once and that's it, you're protected forever. Kids constantly get exposed to similar ailments and thus as adults are much more secure. 

The fact that there are clusters of sickness, as you alluded, is evidence in itself. Unless you believe every kid who is now sick was exposed to a certain virus for the first time, what probably happens is that in a ""normal"" situation immunity to X wanes from 100 to 0 gradually, and the when they are exposed at, say, 60 - they shrug it off and go back to a 100. (in my made up scale, 0 isn't immunocompromised, but just normal immune system that hasn't met X before)

Other contradictory evidence is literally every country that now recommends boosters.

In the Bronx, a youth counselor closed his eyes and steeled himself for the shot. In Queens, a nurse calmed herself by humming gospel music. In Manhattan, a graduate student asked one last question about fertility while reviewing the consent form.

With a mixture of nervousness, resentment and, sometimes relief, hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers finally got a dose of coronavirus vaccine in recent weeks. In some cases, it was because they had a change of heart; perhaps more commonly, it was to keep their jobs.

The uptick in vaccinations has contributed, experts say, to a flattening of the virus curve in New York City, where the numbers of new infections and hospitalizations have been falling ‚Äî a trend across the United States as well.

Yet with winter approaching, public health experts are watching closely for yet another rise in infections. New York‚Äôs vaccination rate is higher than that of the country as a whole, with two out of every three residents fully inoculated. Still, about one million adult New Yorkers have not gotten at least one vaccine dose.

In recent months, the vaccination rates among Black and Hispanic New Yorkers, which had lagged behind those of white and Asian residents, has climbed. But Black residents 18 to 44 remain far less likely to be vaccinated than adults in other groups.

The New York Times interviewed 10 New Yorkers who only recently got vaccinated to find out why they waited so long.

Many cited employer mandates as a major factor. A number of large companies have required employees to get vaccinated, and in the past three weeks, New York State has demanded it of all health care workers. New York City has forced teachers do the same, while requiring all other municipal employees to get vaccinated or undergo regular virus testing.

Some of the newly vaccinated New Yorkers said the mandates were coercive and had left them upset and even more distrustful of government.

Others said they got vaccinated in solidarity with relatives who were doing so, or because a recent bout with Covid-19 had made them feel vulnerable. Some said they were glad to get it over with.

‚ÄúI would go to church with my kids, and I would hear someone cough and I would startle,‚Äù said Cilotte Lovinsky, a hospice nurse, who was vaccinated in September. ‚ÄúNow I feel comfortable.‚Äù

Here are five of their stories:

The home health aide

Tiffany Fields, 35



In the deadly virus wave of early 2020, Tiffany Fields, a home health aide, visited her clients wearing a garbage bag around her body and plastic bags over her shoes because she could not find protective gear at stores. She was that worried about getting sick.

Yet when vaccines became available, she was not interested.

‚ÄúListening to the government was the last thing on my mind,‚Äù Ms. Fields, a delegate for Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union, said.

Skeptical of the flu vaccine as well, she assumed that the development of coronavirus vaccines had been rushed and that it was too soon to know if they were safe.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know if they were testing all the poor people before they gave it to the rich people,‚Äù she said, adding that as a Black woman she had particular concerns about the vaccines, given the history of medical experimentation on Black Americans.

As time passed, she began to wonder whether she was making a mistake. ‚ÄúWhat if they run out of the vaccine and they say you had your chance to take it?‚Äù

Last month, she tested positive for the virus. Despite feeling fine, she spent days sitting in her darkened bedroom, waiting for the worst. She began to draft a letter to her landlord asking that her boyfriend be allowed to continue living in her apartment should she die.

When she emerged from isolation, her attitude toward the vaccine had changed. It was time to get the shot.

‚ÄúYou can hear about the boogeyman all day along,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThen one day he shows up.‚Äù

The nonprofit executive

Emely Paez, 33


Emely Paez said some of her relatives had likened Covid-19 to a bad flu that could be overcome with rest and herbal tea. They also had worries about the new vaccines.

‚ÄúThe feeling was that you‚Äôd be some sort of guinea pig in this experiment,‚Äù she said, noting that such views had influenced her at first.

Ms. Paez gave birth to a son in September 2020 and she feared that vaccinating herself might harm him through her breast milk. The worry is common among many nursing mothers, although researchers have found the opposite to be true: Milk from vaccinated mothers often contains antibodies that may provide protection to infants.

‚ÄúIt was the ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt know,‚Äô‚Äù Ms. Paez said. ‚ÄúThis is a new vaccine, and I‚Äôm putting this in my body and passing it on to my little one. How is he going to react?‚Äù

Her doctor reassured her that she had nothing to worry about. ‚ÄúIf anything, you are giving the baby antibodies he needs,‚Äù she recalled being told.

For much of last year, she and her family were cloistered at home with the newborn. Her older daughter was attending elementary school remotely.

But Ms. Paez realized over this past summer that not getting vaccinated created difficulties. There was what she called the ‚Äúfrustrating‚Äù weekly testing requirement established by the Hispanic Federation, an umbrella organization of nonprofit agencies where she is the director of government affairs and civic engagement. Her partner also was not vaccinated, causing him to miss out on work opportunities.

On a visit to the Bronx Zoo in August, Ms. Paez realized that unvaccinated adults would soon be barred from indoor exhibits there. That would mean no more Congo Gorilla Forest. ‚ÄúWe love those gorillas,‚Äù she said.

As summer turned to fall, she and her partner concluded it was time to get vaccinated. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to continue to have these roadblocks in the things we do,‚Äù she said.

Her partner went first. On Oct. 1, she walked into a Rite Aid for a first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

The ICU nurse

Mechelle Webb, 52


In spring 2020, Mechelle Webb, a critical care nurse at Jamaica Hospital in Queens, cared for the sickest Covid-19 patients, many of them on ventilators. She cleared their breathing tubes, checked their IV lines, turned them in their beds and spoke reassuringly to those who could not respond.

Yet she did not get sick. As time passed, she grew less afraid of Covid-19. She trusted her N95 mask to keep her safe.

She did not get vaccinated when she first had the chance. She has severe allergies and was worried about how her body would react, even though severe allergic reactions to the vaccines are rare. And if wearing a mask worked, why get a vaccine?

She noticed that patients at the hospital who were vaccinated tended to fare better than those who were not. Still, she was unconvinced.

Then the state announced its mandate for hospital workers in mid-August. Ms. Webb, a nurse for 34 years, did not appreciate the pressure. She wanted to reach this decision on her own. ‚ÄúThe mandate should not be the first reason I took it,‚Äù she said.

What to Know About Covid-19 Booster Shots


The F.D.A. authorized booster shots for a select group of people who received their second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at least six months before.

&gt;City employees in Chicago are required to report their vaccination status by the end of Friday, but John Catanzara, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police in Chicago, has urged police officers to ignore the order and risk discipline or loss of pay. Employees who are not vaccinated will be subject to twice-weekly testing, but vaccinations are not required.

&gt;Mr. Catanzara released a video on Tuesday predicting that Chicago police officers would not report to work because of the policy. He said that if a large number of police officers refuse to submit to testing or reporting their vaccination status to the city, ‚Äúit‚Äôs safe to say the city of Chicago will have a police force at 50 percent or less for this weekend coming up.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄùWhatever happens because of the manpower issue, that falls at the mayor‚Äôs doorstep,‚Äù he added.

&gt;He escalated the dispute on Thursday, releasing another video that urged officers not to comply with any direct orders from their supervisors to provide their vaccination status in an online portal.

&gt;But, on Friday, the police union said in a statement: ‚ÄúPresident John Catanzara has never engaged in, supported, or encouraged a work stoppage.‚Äù The police union also announced that it had filed its own legal request for the courts to hear the case.

&gt;Ms. Lightfoot, who has often faced resistance from Mr. Catanzara since taking office in 2019, said in a statement on Friday that his actions threatened public safety.

&gt;‚ÄùAs Chicago‚Äôs mayor, I cannot and will not stand idly by while the rhetoric of conspiracy theorists threatens the health and safety of Chicago‚Äôs residents and first responders,‚Äù Ms. Lightfoot said in a statement. ‚ÄúPresident Catanzara has time and again deliberately misled our police officers by lying about the requirements of the policy and falsely claiming that there will be no repercussions if officers are insubordinate and refuse to follow a city and department directive or order.‚Äù

&gt;On Friday evening, a judge in Cook County ordered Mr. Catanzara to refrain from making additional statements on social media encouraging police officers to refuse to enter their vaccination status in the city portal.

&gt;A strike from the police union is illegal under both state law and the union‚Äôs contract with the city, Ms. Lightfoot said.

&gt;Chicago is following other cities throughout the United States in requiring city employees to be vaccinated or submit to frequent coronavirus testing. Last week, Ms. Lightfoot softened the original policy requiring vaccination, saying that public workers could opt out of the city‚Äôs mandate until the end of the year by getting tested regularly.

&gt;City officials have said that employees who fail to report their vaccination status by the Friday deadline will be placed on unpaid leave.

&gt;In Baltimore, a police union leader told officers not to disclose their vaccination status to city officials amid negotiations over a vaccination mandate scheduled to go into effect there next week, The Baltimore Sun reported.

&gt;Law enforcement officers have died of Covid-19 in large numbers throughout the pandemic, making the virus by far the most common cause of duty-related deaths in 2020 and 2021, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page, a website that catalogs the deaths of law enforcement officers.

&gt;Police officers in many departments have been slow to get vaccinated, and several other cities have issued vaccine or testing mandates. In San Jose, Calif., city leaders decided just as a vaccine mandate was taking effect to allow unvaccinated officers to remain employed through the end of the year, with incremental discipline and testing requirements.

Again, I have no idea if this is true, and haven‚Äôt been able to find good studies, (because it‚Äôs still really, really early in the case of a novel virus and new vaccines). , so my thinking is that by combining two different modems of vaccinations I would (possibly) get a wider coverage against any variations.

Imagine any one of those diseases ***growing constantly worse and never, ever, ever ending***. Imagine trying to keep civilization going when every interaction is a potential for crippling infirmity or death.

For the wealthy, such a problem in the modern world - should covid mutate to become more deadly with a much longer viral-shedding asymptomatic stage - would be environmental suits, highly policed 'bubbles' of interaction, and fortress homes and other locations, staffed by vetted lieutenants.

For the mass of humanity that works and slaves, short brutal lives and very likely the collapse of both economy and independence. At best they would become serfs to the isolated powerful, at worst, degeneration to chaos.

When I was going for a degree in medical biochem, one of the topics we discussed was a worst-case disease scenario. The worst possible case is a disease that has a long asymptomatic stage with a high transmission factor during that stage, followed by symptoms that mixed permanent disability with mass casualties. A world-killer. Or, more precisely, a civilization disruptor. A disease that would bring down the supply chains of the planet.

Covid is very, very close to that specific scenario. Almost eerily so. It isn't there yet, but it could be with only a few small mutations.

I am constantly aware that almost nobody takes covid as seriously as it deserves to be taken. This now endemic disease is not so simple or easy as smallpox, polio, the 1918 flu, or even one of the various plagues. Covid has a long (up to 14 days) asymptomatic period with increasingly high transmission, and it cripples (long covid) and kills.

It is very close to that worst case disease scenario I studied.

Nobody should take covid lightly. It has the potential to be a civilization disruptor, a 'world-killer'.

The problem with the spike protein is that it starts off open, but then to enter a cell it folds up into the spike (bit like an umbrella).   So it has two shapes.   Your immune system needs to recognise the open spike form because it‚Äôs too late when the virus is folding.

Pfizer and Moderna fixed that by giving instructions that were slightly modified, so the spikes produced by those proteins are locked open.

AZ just ignored the problem.  Their spike folds but still seems to produce an ok immune response.

University of Queensland were trying to fix it by adding a clamp to hold the spike protein open.  The clamp they used was made from a hiv protein.   They thought there might be an issue with the immune system noticing the clamp, and making antibodies to that as well as the spike, thus making the person test positive to hiv on the commonly used tests (that look for antibodies against hiv).   But they thought it‚Äôd be rare.   It wasn‚Äôt.  All their test subjects came up positive for both hiv and covid antibodies.   (Would‚Äôve been cool if they‚Äôd accidentally created a combined covid/hiv vaccine, but unfortunately hiv is too good at avoiding the immune system.   Lots of vaccines have been tried, and you get antibodies, but they‚Äôre not effective.)

If it was the only vaccine candidate, it could‚Äôve been ‚Äúfixed‚Äù by changing the hiv test to one that wasn‚Äôt triggered by that particular antibody.   But that would‚Äôve been expensive.   And there were other vaccines coming out that seemed to work effectively without that issue.   So they pulled out of the race.

Unvaccinated individuals that make sure to follow all protective measures or individuals who've recovered from a previous infection spread the virus at a higher rate than vaccinated individuals who walk around pretending there's a higher chance of getting hit by a bus than getting sick? Do you perhaps have a source to back that up?

&gt;Hiding your own fear behind ""but what about developing countries"" is childish at best. What's the argument here? ""I'll get the shot once every Senegalese has got it""?

The argument is what difference does it make if I get vaccinated when there's a good chance of more setbacks? Would it be unwise to wait for updated vaccines, if not for better protection then at least for analysis and mitigation of adverse effects?

&gt;Democracy = the majority/the elected law makers at any given time decides what you can do (smoke, but not snort cocaine) what you can't do (smoke inside) and what you have to do (pay taxes). That fact that you don't like a what you have to do by law doesn't mean its undemocratic, it just means that you don't like it. ""bodily integrity"" is not an argument that serves you - but me - once you realise that your health (and that of others!!) is better protected with the vaccine than without.

I'm not denying that your health is better protected, but seeing as vaccinated individuals are not actually immune in the same way non-smokers are, your health as a vaccinated individual is not protected to the extent that it is when smokers are obliged to smoke outside. So in that sense, a law prohibiting unvaccinated people from entering certain establishments - while technically democratic - can very well be undemocratic.

&gt;Yes, it's fair, because one of the groups are the sole reason why we still have to test at all.

The sole reason? Did you suddenly forget that vaccinated individuals can get sick and spread the virus, especially if they behave as though they can't?

&gt;The alternative (worldwide vaccination rates of 99 % whatever your alternative might be) is not an option, because we can't wait for another 30 years. We will get back to a new normality, without testing everybody all the time.

I'd think a return to normalcy is entirely possible without coercing people into getting a vaccine whose efficacy vs delta is compromised and whose clinical trials are to be completed no sooner than December of 2022.

&gt;Why can't you people just stop arguing and start accepting what is necessary?

Gladly, so long as everything going on actually makes sense.

&gt;I would've preferd not having had to get a relatively new vaccine against a disease that probably wouldn't hurt me anyway, but might hurt my postman's neighbour's grandma.

There is no solid reason that J&amp;J recipients should not get a mRNA booster or should have to wait for that horrid ACIP panel to go over the same data that the VRBPAC already went over today and then just offer them another J&amp;J dose.

People who were told to get ""whatever you can---they are all good"" are being horribly served by the FDA/CDC and J&amp;J/Janssen with this. After being ignored for 6 months, the VRBPAC waits to vote on the ""mix and match"". Janssen produces a 17 person study on boosters.

From what I have seen in the NIH study, the evidence shows that J&amp;J recipients benefit from having an mRNA boost far more than a J&amp;J boost.

All over the world people are mixing viral vector and mRNA vaccines with no issues and good results.

&gt;Not according to experts. They talk of many factors being at play ‚Äì and warn it may not last.

&gt;‚ÄùWe‚Äôre in a phase where we still have large numbers of people dying from this disease,‚Äù said Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh. ‚ÄúBut it has gone into the background. We‚Äôve become used to something that has not gone away. I think there‚Äôs been a desensitisation to the mortality.‚Äù

&gt;On Thursday, the UK reported more than 45,000 new coronavirus cases ‚Äì the most since mid-July ‚Äì and more than 800 deaths were reported in the past seven days. Hospitalisations are rising, with one-fifth of ICU beds occupied by Covid patients, and the latest figures showed an estimated 200,000 pupils absent from school.

&gt;The UK is faring far worse than its European neighbours, with a rate of deaths per million people nearly triple those seen in France, Germany and Italy.

You need to look at the 2nd and 3rd order effects on Officer deaths.

https://www.odmp.org/search/year/2021

If you look at the base document, it shows 231 Covid deaths, 48 from gunfire, and 16 from vehicular assault, 12 from struck by vehicle, 16 from automobile crash, 15 from heart attack, 3 from motorcycle crashes, and 2 from vehicle pursuit.

That means that Covid was 

49 from all vehicle incidents, which are usually the deadliest thing that Officers encounter (speed, maneuvering, trying to stop suspects who don't want to stop, driving in the worst of conditions, etc.). 

The 48 gunfire are hard to parse without the specific details, but this past year has been pretty crazy.

The 15 from heart attacks seem to be pretty normal; it's a high-stress job.

Covid is killing people at x5 to x6 the next biggest killer. Besides that, the average age is 48. That means these are not young Officers who normally do stupid stuff like shoot first and ask questions later. The incidents that you're making an inference to are normally done by people who in the ""olden days"" would have had a veteran Officer with them.

&gt;Younger Police Officers Are More Likely To Shoot People Than Older Ones

&gt;&gt;Research shows that younger officers are more likely to be involved in shootings, even though age is rarely mentioned as a factor in the aftermath. ""It‚Äôs a dirty little secret that we‚Äôre hiring police officers too young,"" a veteran Boston officer said.

Meat and potatoes:

&gt;The police-involved killings that ignited nationwide outrage and federal investigations in the past year saw several stark similarities among the victims: They were mostly young, black, and unarmed.

&gt;As for the officers in those high-profile cases, most who pulled the trigger were white. Many had disciplinary records. And a number of them had another thing in common: They were under the age of 30.

The TL;DR here is that we are losing a bunch of experienced Officers when we least can afford to lose that experience. It will be exceeding difficult to replace that 5, 10, or 15 years of experience of dealing with people on the street. We are actually going to have more problems, and the world will not be safer because of this.",,,,1634394910,{},hgv46pa,False,t3_q92hra,False,True,t1_hgutcuv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q92hra/covid19_was_cause_of_death_for_2_of_every_3_nc/hgv46pa/,1634519328.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over and over again science and government bet that this virus wouldn‚Äôt be as bad as it was and they were wrong. We should assume this virus will stay in circulation for a long time and that our plans need to start taking into account the fact that this is a long-term situation not something we‚Äôre going to solve in 1 to 3 years.

It‚Äôs not only impractical to ask people to continue to wear masks for years, but it‚Äôs probably counterproductive to the point that they will resent the advice and take the entire virus Mitigation effortless seriously because you‚Äôre giving them advice that doesn‚Äôt really add up.

It‚Äôs more like people need to get vaccinated or die You all the rest of us are going to live like we‚Äôre in a endless pandemic for years so 30% of the country can live in a fantasy world.

They can all live in a fantasy world when they‚Äôre dead and rotting in the ground.

If liberals and the rest of the same people would take that approach it would be a lot more effective because then the primarily conservative vaccine deniers would start to understand better that They‚Äôre killing themselves and their ideological Opposition is effectively laughing at them.

You can‚Äôt reach them with science, but you can reach them with shame and You can use their own narrow minded polarization against them knowing that all this stems mostly from a political divide between liberals and conservatives. 

This means that a big part of conservative the guy at a higher rate that will convince conservatives to take the scenario seriously more than all the signs in the world.

You need to stop being so nice and start laughing in the face of the increase death rate a vaccine deniers. Sure it‚Äôs mean, But it‚Äôs also more effective.

A good lesson that most of you Still need to learn is that when a person or group of people doesn‚Äôt believe in science you don‚Äôt just keep arguing the scientific points you immediately move onto shaming them and making fun of them because they will understand that even if they refused to understand the science.

Why does no public official mention VAERs? I have not heard Fauci mention it. I have not heard the Surgeon General mention it. I have not heard my governor mention it. The doctors who recommended the vaccine to me did not mention it. It seems to me that a reporting/warning system may be the single most important component of implementing a new, emergency use medication.

Are autopsies being performed after a death is reported in VAERs? There are thousands of deaths reported in there. Yes I understand that after you give millions of people anything, some will pass away just by coincidence. But that is not what the system is intended for. The system is intended to monitor adverse reactions. Are the thousands of deaths being examined?

Last question. Let's say a young, healthy person has a heart attack 3 days after receiving the vaccine. Let's say someone (the people at VAERs/NIH or whoever is supposed to care) want to look into the cause of that death. How would one scientifically investigate what caused a death? The same goes for all of the less extreme side effects being reported in VAERs and Yellow Card and all there analogs. How would one link Tinnitus to any vaccine? Or vertigo?

There needs to be some elasticity there, ability to look at things real time.

I understand this is hard for some scientists to wrap their mind around that.  But if you're often a day late and a dollar short with your recommendations, people will start making their own decisions.

It was quite obvious that J&amp;J was less effective from the get-go.  It should have never taken this long to recommend boosters for those people.  Hence you had a bunch of people who took it upon themselves to get boosted.

The current screaming that they don't have enough data to recommend boosters for Moderna/Pfizer, when Israel is about to hit herd immunity once again after their boosting campaign.  This topic has been beaten to death, and we all know there is a lot more to this than their claimed ""lack of data"".

You seem reasonable so let me ask you a question.

You seem to think the hospitals are making bank when they intubate someone. 

But really from what I just read that is the average cost for a hospital stay before Covid. In fact in 2002 

""Mean intensive care unit cost and length of stay were 31,574 +/- 42,570 dollars and 14.4 days +/- 15.8 for patients requiring mechanical ventilation and 12,931 +/- 20,569 dollars and 8.5 days +/- 10.5 for those not requiring mechanical ventilation.""

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15942342/

That's nineteen years ago. Nineteen years ago the average cost was $32,000 to $42,000. Given inflation the hospitals are probably losing money on every single Medicare patient they intubate. 

So why would a hospital go to a more extreme treatment if it wasn't necessary and it doesn't make the hospital any money?

I'm 100% pro-vaccine (I collect them like Pokemon) and very eagerly got my Pfizer shots as quickly as I could (note: I got my first one EOM February!). But I also recognize that there is SOME risk to every vaccine, even routine vaccines like MMR/polio (however low.) We shouldn't entirely disregard those and assume that it's risk-free.

We have to figure out the right balance of risk-reward for every intervention and work with it. If it turns out that this is a three-series vaccine, then by all means let's do it. But that doesn't mean we just assume that we should vaccinate everyone every 6 months regardless of the benefit analysis.

The answer though is we completely don't know and aren't trying to find out.  We did some limited research comparing second doses at one month versus three, and it immediately became clear waiting three months was better.

After infection, the immune response continues to broaden for 6 months before reaching full maturity.  6 months from the most recent dose is probably a good timeline from what little we do know.
