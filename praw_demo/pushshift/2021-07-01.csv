Exactly. That's why your ""after it has infected people"" comment is off. If it can spread, it will, regardless of whether infection occurred before, during or after symptoms.

&gt; Because those 10 people will run into another 10 people and so on.

Do you at least acknowledge that mutation B in my example, which infects 40 people, will end up infecting more people than mutation A? Because that's the crux of it.

Again, this statement holds no meaning. What do you mean by ""more virulent form of the virus""? The original strain? Delta? All variants will continue evolving, what is your point?

The only exception would be a very well fitting and filtering mask with great procedures (which is extremely rare). But vaccination provides protection all of the time, so it's also more effective practically since it works while eating, etc.

The main threat are people who choose to not get vaccinated even if they are able to and as it mutates, we'll need to rely on ""herd immunity"" more and more as vaccinated people's immunity basically won't be as effective (hopefully not of course).  Basically to help slow things down to allow functionality until there's a booster.

Of course, people who are fully vaccinated can still have a bad case or even die, it just becomes way rarer.  This was the case with the original varients and it's more the case with the delta varient (though still rare thankfully).  So being vaccinated and masked (ideally with a well fitting and effective one) is the safest way besides fully isolating.  It's particularly a good idea for people who are at extremely high risk (highly immunocompromised, older with conditions, etc).

I personally don't think vaccinated people should be expected to wear a mask, but encouraged to if they would like to up their safety.  The focus and pressure should be on people who refuse to vaccinate.  Even though I'm personally still masking (I didn't get a vaccine for everything after all and it's nice not having infections - though everything is down thanks to the measures).

It's just illogical to hold vaccinated people who are a much lower threat to the same standard (with potentially an exception for healthcare settings due to a few factors). Of course, the main issue is that unvaccinated people are disproportionately a threat to local health systems which can affect absolutely everyone directly and indirectly.  So having everyone masks helps to ensure they do as well.  Once masks become optional unvaccinated people also tend to see them as optional from what I've seen and read.

It's actually pretty infuriating because we can only have all this stuff operate without screwing the health systems and economy because of people vaccinating.  Highly effective vaccinates are way more effective than all the other measures combined which are way more cumbersome and bad for livelihoods, etc. Having some sort of pass to go maskless would solve this, but there's no way widespread implementation is happening in the US, so it's the price of ""freedom"".

Of course, vaccinated people should start masking if there's a truly vaccine escaping varient (when it comes to bad cases and deaths that can screw over medical systems, one minor symptom is not a big deal but can count as a case) until there's a booster.",,,1625252561,{},h3u7lvf,False,t3_occkh7,False,False,t1_h3tk09z,/r/Coronavirus/comments/occkh7/st_louis_area_health_officials_urge_all_residents/h3u7lvf/,1625496464,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There are 600,000 12-15 year-olds in Israel, and 10,000 vaccine appointments have been booked for children in the age group so far.   
  
The Health Ministry announced the campaign will go ahead last Wednesday, after a study on a possible link between the vaccine and heart inflammation in young males, a condition known as myocarditis, found that the risks of myocarditis are minor compared with those of COVID-19.  
  
According to the study's findings, which were delivered to the Health Ministry yesterday, the second dose of the COVID vaccine was linked to cases of myocarditis in males aged 16-30, with the risk decreasing with age. Most myocarditis cases linked to the vaccine were mild and lasted only a few days.

Prof. Nachman Ash, who leads the Israeli efforts against the virus, told Israeli 103 FM radio station that though the vaccine can cause myocarditis, the phenomenon is rare. ""In ages 16-19, which is our reference group, the ratio is one in 6,000 and the illness is mostly mild and brief,"" he said. ""It is more common in boys than in girls.

Protect against what?  He was talking about not very high protection against infection, NOT about severe disease.  All vaccines in the market are excellent protection against severe disease.

Also look at Israel and UK, which also DON""T use Chinese vaccine and have high vaccination rate.  Their cases are also risen.

This is from Dr. Vincent Racaniello's biweekly reddit QA session. Protection moderate to severe disease is the goal of any vaccine, NOT the infection. After a year or two, even best mRNA vaccine will not protected you from infection unless you got another booster shot. A lot of people on this forum and popular media don't seem to understand the basic of virology and is always worry about efficacy against infection while we should be concern about efficacy against moderate/severe disease.

""Not clear to me why boosters are needed. So far most of the vaccines appear to prevent severe disease with all the variants. Infection is not prevented, only moderate to severe disease. That is how most human vaccines work. I think there is a tendency to extrapolate from influenza virus where a decrease in antibody neutralization titer against current strains triggers reformulation of the vaccine. But SARS-CoV-2 is not influenza virus. I think we need to observe how vaccinated people respond to infection and keep track of disease severity. If it seems like more severe disease is occurring in vaccinated people, then we might change the vaccine. But remember that T cells protect against severe disease and their epitopes do not change in the variants.""

""Those studies were done shortly after vaccination when antibody levels are very high. In a year the serum and mucosal antibody levels will be very low and will not prevent infection. However the memory response will kick in in 2-3 days and prevent extensive replication, shedding, and disease.""

""The benefit of the inactivated vaccines is that they contain other viral proteins, not just spike. Those other viral proteins have T cell epitopes which can only be beneficial and help prevent disease. The need for booster probably comes from not having enough inactivated virus, or it not generating a good memory response.""

It was only yesterday I was reading about some places scheduling mRNA second-doses for J&amp;J recipients as though it was an emergency, it doesn't seem clear that's needed at all. Indeed, it seems a shame (from a long-term protection perspective) that most of the world went very cold on J&amp;J very quickly.

It's never regained popularity in the USA after the early scare, a number of EU countries stopped the roll-out as soon as it started[0], and roll-out never even started in the UK (although it has been approved and 60m doses are due over the next six months, but all eligible people will have had one of the other vaccines before it arrives).

If this study isn't a one-off, it looks like this should be the preferred option for any winter boosters. Although that's still too early to say (regarding my opening paragraph), the CovBoost trial (and others) will be interesting. And, of course, it's not yet clear whether boosters are strictly required at all yet, in which case COVAX and other recipients will be the beneficiary of all these doses.

Yes

&gt; If so, once they run out of antibodies in the future

Do you know how the immune system works?  Antibodies are generated to fight off active infections.  Once the infection is disabled, your body stops producing those antibodies because it’s no longer needed, as the production of antibodies is triggered by detection of foreign particles.  Your body doesn’t just continuously produce antibodies to fight the SARS-2 virus when there’s no detection of that virus.  And of course, since nothing last forever, the antibodies that are still there after the infection has been fought off are gonna chill around in your body until they eventually break down.  But the memory calls that produce these antibodies live in your bone marrow and they remember how to make the same antibodies should your body defect the same virus.  Just because your antibodies level goes down after an infection does not mean your immune system is incapable of producing them again, and it does not mean you are not protected.  

In fact, it’s likely that if you’ve had covid, you’re protected for life

If the definite article were used (""the Delta variant is not driving *the* hospitalization surge"") I'd definitely think there was a surge going on, so the indefinite article to me pretty clearly implies that there isn't one.

Although, weirdly: in your example (""immigration is not to blame for a surge in crime""), I *do* totally feel that ambiguity you're describing. I can't really explain it either. It's something about ""to blame for"" - maybe, like, you'd never blame someone for something that isn't actually happening, so if there's blame to go around maybe that thing must be happening?

For example, in the case where we have highly effective vaccines, and the strong preponderance of the currently available evidence is that vaccinated individuals are much less likely to spread the virus to others — which is exactly the situation we’re in right now. Then, if you add the factor of someone living in an area with high vaccination rates (like I do), the practical need for further risk reduction measures becomes almost nonexistent IMO. Sure, if I continued to wear a mask, having had a highly effective vaccine, living in a highly vaccinated region, and knowing my chance of spreading is very low anyways, yes, I would theoretically be reducing the spread incrementally more. But again, I reject the idea that I have the moral responsibility to, at all times, limit risk to others as much as is humanly possible. The risk to others will always be nonzero, but nonzero risk is the currency of living life. At the beginning of the pandemic, with such sparse information, such limited data, such insufficient testing and treatment, and no vaccine whatsoever, I would have completely agreed with you. At this point? No.

Also, if I lived in Germany? What a bizarre analogy, lol. I think that the question of what I would do if I had lived in Germany, is frankly irrelevant in this case.

It is. There’s a study from Thailand I believe. 
I’ll try to find it.

Edit: Could not find the Thailand study but did find these. /u/donobinladin /u/ganner

Note that GAVI is handling the logistics of getting vaccines to countries who have less bargaining power as individual sovereign states (COVAX).

1.
&gt;	Delta, first identified in India, has the potential “to be more lethal because it’s more efficient in the way it transmits between humans and it will eventually find those vulnerable individuals who will become severely ill, have to be hospitaliSed and potentially die,” Dr Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s health emergencies program, said during a news conference.

Link: (I can pm link)

2.
&gt;	Delta is also rapidly spreading in Southeast China. Here, doctors are reporting that patients are becoming sicker and their conditions deteriorating more quickly than the patients they treated at the start of the pandemic.

&gt;	According to a Scottish study published in The Lancet on 14 June, the Delta variant is associated with approximately double the risk of hospitalisation compared with the Alpha variant.

So let me tell you what's going to happen if Boris continues.  R0 for Delta is around 8.  That's in unvaccinated uninfected population.  So for herd immunity an immunity rate of 1/R0 =&gt; 90%, approximately.  The vaccine is very good, but it's not 100% sterilising.  R for UK is currently sitting somewhere around 1.3 and a doubling rate of around 7-8 days.  

We currently have 10 million unvaccinated adults, another 12 million under 18s, 11 million single does and 33 million double dose.  

At current rates from yesterday we'll see 200,000 daily infections in three weeks.  Obviously doing some back-of-envelope calculations on sterility rates in the vaccinated we'll run out of people who can be infected within around three months, but *vaccination rate only increases linearly whilst infection rate is exponential*.

So of the 10 million unvaccinated around 9 million will be infected in the next two months. Again back of the envelope would indicate, using available figures on mortality across the range, we're probably looking at around another 5,000 deaths - although as this will be  among younger people it's probably a more tragic 5,000.

However, given that long corvid isn't to be discounted and isn't correlated to mortality, we're going to see a lot of that - possibly enough to discount the cost of another couple of months of restrictions just while we got 90% of the population up to double vaccinated status

Sure, if you're so desperate for a pint while watching the footie and a trip to Ibiza that you're willing to kill 5000 people for that then fine.  Myself, being double vaccinated I'm highly unlikely to be affected and if it burns through fast from a personal point of view ignoring those 5,000 dead I'll be back to normal quicker.

The point I was making really was centered on the way the CDC approaches its public communications. 

So often we find on the surface that WHO and CDC talking points appear to be at odds, although when we read more deeply we find alignment. 

The CDC in my opinion is struggling in its PR and communications because of how politicized handling Covid has become in the US. 

But if your risk assessment says “we may have some serious issues in 1000+ communities with low vaccine uptake” then you need to make that a stand-alone primary talking point. 

As simple as “for communities with low vaccination rates we urge local policy makers to continue to advocate for mask wearing” as the main and first talking point. 

Smart people can make smart decisions based on that without diminishing the msg for those who are not.

This would be clearer if the dashboard used a log scale. 

It is **extremely** premature to declare victory whilst case numbers are still doubling roughly every fortnight. 

__________________________

People tend to stay in hospital with COVID-19 for about 10 days, as evidenced by the fact that the peak bed occupancy was about 10 times the peak admission rate. 

In the last wave, the peak of about 60,000 daily cases produced about 4,000 daily hospital admissions, so about 6.7% of cases sent somebody to hospital.

The last date at which we have 7-day rolling average admissions data is the 24^th of June, at which point the rate was about 250. It takes about a week for cases to translate to admissions; on the 17^th the 7-day average case rate was about 10,000.

On this basis, 2.5% of cases now result in hospital admission.

2.5/6.7 = 0.37, which is broadly in line with the official odds ratio in the first link.

The problem is that if cases keep doubling every couple of weeks, the number of people in hospital will still become unacceptable. This odds ratio doesn't quite buy two doubling periods. 

To put it another way, if things continue as they are, assuming that peak capacity is about 40,000 patients, and people stay in hospital for about 10 days, if 2.5% of cases result in hospital admission then the maximum daily case number we can tolerate is 160,000. 

The rolling average was 15,000 on the 22^nd of June, and 7,400 on the the 10^th. Therefore, the doubling period is actually less than 14 days, so using 14 days is conservative.

Log2(160000/15000) = 3.41, so we have about 3.4 doubling periods before things get out of hand. That's about 48 days, so around the 9^th of August.

You are wrong.  It is only to monitor and track.  Not to rehabilitate.  That's a different service.  And fact check: ex-cons do relapse into crime and do walk among us as well.  You're not at liberty to know who is or is not on probation.  

&gt;So if we can make this safety determination in 4 years instead of 5, why not just shorten it to 4 then, even without a vaccine? Restricting freedoms longer than necessary is pointless and evil. And none of it should be tied to vaccine intake.

Again, you miss the point.  Even if the probation was 4 years, he's offering to commute 3 years for completing a civic duty and getting vaccinated.  Same as he would for someone who did community service.  Because that's what getting vaccinated when you don't feel the risk is too great to yourself is: a community service.

&gt;No. We will return to normal when we decide to return to normal. Texas dropped their mask mandate like 3 or 4 months ago and everyone predicted doomsday, but nothing catastrophic happened except they returned to normal life.

OK, depending on what you mean.

Also:

&gt;... a growing body of evidence suggests that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines also reduce asymptomatic infection and transmission. Substantial reductions in SARS-CoV-2 infections (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) will reduce overall levels of disease, and therefore, viral transmission in the United States. However, investigations are ongoing to assess further the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on transmission.

([source](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/fully-vaccinated-people.html))

We don't know for sure yet, but plenty of medical experts allow for the possibility (or likelihood) that vaccinated people can be strongly less likely to transmit.

This holds at least equally true for unvaccinated people as well, arguably more so since some of them still think covid is a hoax. But yes vaccination limiting the severity of cases would cause a potential sampling bias.

For me the question is how does this differ from the early days of covid where young people without symptoms were also not getting tested. Hell when I had covid in March 2020 I couldn't even get a rapid test because my fever wasn't high enough and I didn't have enough comorbidities.

It's really hard to know what the true mortality rate is and I suspect it will be the source of many future studies. For now though the numbers we are seeing still doesn't line up well with the narrative I'm seeing from most articles nor does it really support the complete lack of restrictions and mask mandates in most places. I guess my real point here is if we saw these numbers in the pre-vaccine era we would still be in lockdown. Now that the restrictions have been lifted it seems to be more of a case of it being difficult and unpopular to reimpose them than them being unnecessary.

Let's just knock this one out of the way first. In a highly vaccinated population we should not expect hospitalizations to show the same exponential growth as previous waves for which there was limited (or no) vaccine distribution. Unless an outbreak was exclusively running through an unvaccinated segment of the population somehow we know that the vaccines provide sufficient protection against more severe illness and should adjust our assumptions accordingly.

While hospitalizations in the UK have tripled over the last month and a half we do see a pretty strong break so far vs the overall growth of infections. We aren't seeing the same growth pattern hospitalizations exhibited in previous waves in the UK.

It's a lot easier to run a telemarketing scam from India than from Nigeria. In fact, sometimes it's the same telemarketing subcontractors that primarily serve western businesses that sideline with scams when their call load drops. Workers just have multiple scripts and switch back and forth.

Many African cities are well above the economic level needed to support these scams, so are a LOT of Chinese cities since China is ahead of India economically.

My sense is that culture, language, and the great firewall of china also play a significant role. Chinese people are used to assuming that all communication is monitored heavily. And China is more heavily involved in manufacturing than telemarketing and coding that involves higher integration into American businesses.

Essentially, you see Chinese scams selling counterfeit products (sometimes even authentic products that fell off a production line and are sold without the manufacturer's markup) because that's their primary interaction with western consumers.

Is that reductive? Absolutely. There's lots of other factors, and plenty of crossover.

Is it accurate? Yeah, I think it is. Heck, the stereotypes might well be driving news coverage, since that's primarily what we're talking about here. I hesitate to conclude that though, because I haven't seen data on Indian vs Chinese scams.

But India vs. Pakistan is numbers, and India vs. Kenya is numbers plus additional poverty in Kenya pushing the proportion of capable Kenyans even lower than the proportion of capable Indians.

I think India vs. China is primarily specialization in coding and telemarketing vs. manufacturing. I think that's reinforced by the PRC that tries to limit the influence of western culture that would come with hundreds of thousands of telemarketers and coders integrated fairly deeply into American companies.",,,1625249778,{},h3u0zye,False,t3_oc597j,False,True,t1_h3tjz0y,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oc597j/thousands_jabbed_with_unknown_substances_at_fake/h3u0zye/,1625492597,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Right now, there are around 1000 cases/day, but still around 1200 COVID patients in the hospital.

So actually there are *more* patients in the hospital per confirmed positive test! Not fewer. This is probably because only people with serious symptoms are getting tested as well.

If ' vaccinations have completely broken the link between hospitalization/death rates and infection rates' like you claim, we would still see positive COVID tests, but almost no patients in the hospital anymore. Instead, what we are seeing is that hospitalizations are down, but they are down by about the same factor as the case rates.

It seems to me that the US hasn't yet reached the vaccination rates necessary yet for this to happen. Of course, the vaccines are helping a lot to keep cases and hospitalizations down.

&gt; Officials agreed to halve the number of people permitted to enter the nation under an already strict border policy that bars entry to nearly everyone except returning citizens, residents and their immediate families, who must quarantine for two weeks in a hotel at their own expense.

&gt; Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who has come under fire for a slow vaccination rollout, said further restricting international arrivals was “a prudent action while we remain in this suppression phase of the virus.”

&gt; “The delta strain is more contagious and so we’re seeking to take precautionary steps to overall reduce the risk,” he told reporters in his first public appearance since he began quarantining at his official residence in Canberra two weeks ago after attending the Group of Seven summit in Britain.

&gt; Only about 6 percent of Australia’s population is fully vaccinated, the lowest rate in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. One factor in the slow rollout is that Australian officials advised against using the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in anyone under 60 because of the remote risk of blood clots.

&gt; Sufficient supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines to complete the rollout aren’t due to arrive until later in the year.

&gt; The feeble vaccination campaign and return to lockdowns stands in contrast to Australia’s much-vaunted success earlier in the pandemic, when much of the country had gone months without restrictions, with people free to gather on beaches, in stadiums and in shopping malls, mask-free.

&gt; “We’ve squandered the head start we got in 2020. It has been a policy disaster,” Tim Soutphommasane, a political commentator and professor at the University of Sydney, wrote in the Guardian on Friday. “Australia can’t defeat the pandemic by jumping in and out of lockdown, or by sealing ourselves indefinitely from the rest of the world.”",,,1625239268,{},h3tb9lp,True,t3_occ9nl,False,False,t3_occ9nl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/occ9nl/were_prisoners_australia_locks_out_thousands_more/h3tb9lp/,1625478301,24,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This, from the top of my head, is what you need:

\- Your planet is in the habitable zone of it's parent star.

\- Must contain plenty of liquid water and elements that are a prereq for life (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen etc. etc.)

\- The inside of the planet must have enough internal friction (plate tectonics etc.) to create a strong enough magnetic field to ward off deadly stellar radiation.

\- An extremely massive planet like Jupiter to act as a gravitational lightning rod for asteroids.

\- An extremely rare symbiosis event like the one that created mitochondria. Without these cellular power plants cells simply lack the energy sustain multicellurar lifeforms. These were originally independent lifeforms that entered such a strong symbiosis with another lifeform that they eventually merged into a single whole (proof that mitochondria were once an independent lifeform is the fact that they still have their own DNA).

\- Finally, it is also thought that tides caused by our moon (which is very massive for a planetary satellite) and the capacity of the Earth to experience lightning strikes has helped early life to evolve.

I'm by no means an expert on the topic (just an interested layman) so I might be wrong on some of these and mght have not thought of others but after some digging into the matter I found that for a planet to harbor life a lot more conditions have to be met than I originally thought. It's not just a matter of ""have water and some other elements, be between 283 and 303 Kelvin, wait a few hundred million years and poof, life"".

Is there data anywhere on how long a fully vaccinated person would take to clear the virus if they contract COVID but stay asymptomatic? Also, any current-ish data on just how many breakthrough infections are happening?

My husband and I are leaving for Mexico in a little over a week - we're both fully vaccinated with Pfizer (since mid-April) and even though we have resumed a lot of normal life with a bit of domestic travel and eating out in restaurants occasionally, we do still both work from home and have found that a year at home has us still mostly preferring to be here rather than elsewhere. 

But that said, we booked this trip a year ago out of desperation, just to have something to look forward to, never thinking we'd be vaccinated in time to take it... and we are, so we want to. Our plan is to do as much outdoors as possible and we aren't leaving the resort, nor do we get into the party scene at the resort, either. 

My fear is getting caught with a positive rapid test in Mexico then being stuck down there for up to two weeks, though my understanding is that the resort we're going to will test you several times during your quarantine to try and get you home earlier than the 14 days. 

We are both getting tested before we leave, and starting Sunday pretty much staying at home until the trip. I'm just curious on how worried we even need to be about a positive test and if we have one, how long it could reasonably be expected until we tested negative again. 

I did read the post on this thread yesterday from the Redditor that got a positive test while in Mexico which is sort of what prompted this.

[],,Jacc3,,,[],,,,text,t2_d3u0b,False,False,[],"**Update on Swedish vaccinations**

*Numbers are from end of last week (either from Thursday or Friday) so they are slightly lower than the numbers cited in the press release*

61.0% of all adults (18+) have received at least one shot, and 38.7% of all adults are fully vaccinated. In terms of full population (Sweden has 10.40m inhabitants), the percentages are approx. 48% for first shots and 30% full vaccinations. A total of 8 168 667 doses have been administered, i.e. 79 per 100 pop.

In practice, only Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna is used now. AstraZeneca is restricted to 65+ and Johnsson&amp;Johnsson is paused indefinitely.

A few of Sweden's regions have started vaccinating 18+, but most are still doing around 25+ or 30+. Everyone 16+ (or 12+ with comorbities) is recommended to take the vaccine once available to them. The nationwide age distribution is currently

Age | First dose coverage | Full vaccination
---|---|----
18-29 | 13.06% | 7.74%
30-39 | 24.84% | 9.79%
40-49 | 56.74% | 14.61%
50-59 | 78.16% | 35.05%
60-69 | 88.49% | 72.01%
70-79 | 93.17% | 81.81%
80-89 | 93.56% | 88.83%
90+ | 90.84% | 85.08%

The national goal is that all adults should have been offered a first dose by Sep 19. This is however based on a 100% vaccine acceptance, so in reality it will be done sooner. Actual acceptance seems to be around 90% according to both the public health agency and the independent Kantar/Sifo.

The past 8 days a total of 939 665 doses have been administered, which is an average of 117 458 per day. Adjusted to US population this corresponds to 3.9m doses/day. Most vaccinations recently seem to be 2nd doses rather than 1st doses.

Around 740k doses have been delivered per week recently, but deliveries from Pfizer/BioNTech will be decreasing from July onwards - bringing that number down to a bit below 500k. On the other hand, Moderna deliveries are expected to increase, especially in August.

A bit more than 16m doses is required to fully vaccinate all adults, i.e. around 8m additional doses are needed for that.

So relative to the peak of COVID last winter and when we didn’t have anyone vaccinated, your chances are much lower of death if you’re vaccinated, by 94-96% and then another 99-99.2%. Something like .049% chance of death and probably only if vulnerable to begin with. I think the CFR for unvaccinated is something like 0.5-1%. So that’s at least 10x lower chances of death.

In the UK, around 50% of total population is fully vaccinated, and 67% has one dose.  
Assuming one dose efficacy at preventing infection is 35%, and 2 dose is 79%, and there is no natural infection, then they are 45% immune at the moment. 

For heard immunity they need to claim a third of that remaining 55% -- they need to be 63% immune. This would happen at around 72% of people fully vaccinated, and still 17% with one dose.

Because I pretended natural infections didn't happen, it means that it would need more than 72% in reality.  
Because UK still has restrictions in place, you'd need even more to fully open up with heard immunity.

People are looking at the rising case numbers in UK and such and much slower rising levels of hospitalization/death, and are saying ""The vaccines are preventing death, but not as good at preventing infection""  
Which isn't really what's actually happening. The reason the deaths are staying relatively flat despite cases rising is more largely due to the vaccines being good at preventing infection. It's pretty unintuitive, but if you look at the breakdown of cases by age group, you'll see that cases AREN'T rising in the groups that are most at risk, and also most well vaccinated.  

This is /partially/ because vaccines are preventing them from getting infected. However, that only is having such a large effect because these groups aren't well mixed. We know that the vaccine is somewhere in the 80s% effective at preventing infection. If the elderly were as likely to interact with an infected 20 year old as a fellow 20 year old is likely to interact with an infected 20 year old, then we would expect the case numbers to be rising in the elderly.  

However, because the elderly generally aren't interacting with the younger folk, a rise in cases in younger folk has little impact on a rise in cases in elderly folk. Additionally, the elderly folk are well vaccinated enough that when any of them do get infected, the virus will not sustainably infect from elderly to elderly. Basically, the elderly folks have heard immunity, and if they stay within their heard, case numbers will not rise. 

If I'm correct with all of that, then an elderly person surrounded by sick people will be more at risk than you may expect from the UK Cases:Deaths ratio.   
I'd go off of the stated vaccine efficacy in preventing hospitalization, which I think is at 96%-98% now.",,,1625240855,{},h3tf1re,False,t3_oby5os,False,False,t1_h3qwurl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oby5os/covid_cases_rise_but_israel_has_least_deadly/h3tf1re/,1625480225,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The prior numbers from the CDC are also inaccurate because in order for breakthrough cases to be counted, people have to be tested. Many vaccinated people are not getting tested, even if they have symptoms. They may assume their symptoms are caused by something else (allergies, cold or flu) or don't see a point in getting tested (even if they think its covid) or don't want to quarantine or miss work. So the real number of breakthrough cases is much higher. 

The other thing is that back when CDC was collecting data, much of the US was still shut down. People were (and still are) working from home. Schools were not open even in every state.

Many such drugs on the market are actually not FDA approved because they are in the final post-market monitoring phase, meaning that they are being prescribed, sold, and administered but have not yet been given the final stamp of approval to freely distribute without further analysis.

It is a mistake to believe that approval is required to sell a drug for treatment of infectious disease. The drug merely needs to be in the process of approval, which all of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are. The Pfizer, Moderna and J&amp;J vaccines were granted emergency use by the White House through an executive order invoking the FDA's EUA authority, but are all effectively in post-market monitoring phase of FDA approval.

I also should note that there are serious safety and ethical considerations for post-market-approval monitoring. Many professionals have raised concerns that the practice encourages the FDA and other authorities to push drugs to market that haven't gone through sufficient clinical trial. Some argue that this phase should be eliminated entirely for a more thorough clinical trial phase. Others point out that the post-market analysis demonstrates remarkable safety. There is a balance to be struck between the ethical concerns of slow and steady, and the need for new drugs.

My entire point is that the numbers we are seeing, at least in terms of deaths, isn't that different from early 2020 when full lockdown was in effect, yet now almost everywhere in the US there isn't even a mask mandate.

It doesn't make sense to divide the number of hospitalizations and deaths by the total population of vaccinated individuals, especially if delta is close to as contagious (though far less serious) among vaccinated people. If you look at the deaths per cases that comes out to 62/7553, which is a mortality rate of 0.82%. The original strain in the pre-vaccine era had a mortality rate that was only 2 to 3 times as high. I really really want this stupid pandemic to be over with, but not to the point of being okay with a complete return to normalcy when there is a more contagious strain with a mortality rate only 2x or 3x lower among those who are fully vaccinated and higher in those who aren't. 

A strain that is 60% more contagious, with the vaccine(s) not showing a significant protection against infection, with a mortality rate of 0.82% among vaccinated people and higher than early covid strains for unvaccinated people does not mesh with the ""everything is fine"" articles that keep being posted.

The only upside to dragging on the process is to mitigate pressure on emergency rooms and hospitals. The downsides are many and varied, and effectiveness is not guaranteed since the people being protected are those least likely to follow rules and restrictions.

I am registered for it in the public system, and I'll take whatever I can get. I'll pay for it if necessary, I have no problem paying, but there is no private availability. There is a plan for [Moderna to be available privately](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2128287/moderna-price-set-at-3-800-baht-for-two-doses
) but that only ""starts"" in October, if there are no delays. And there have been constant delays on everything else, so...

&gt;The vaccine will come in three lots — 4 million doses in October, 1 million early next year and 5 million more later.

And this is for the private vaccination to *start*. Based on my risk profile- under 55 with no chronic diseases- I wouldn't likely be in the first batch anyway. So we are looking at ""early next year"" or possibly even ""later"" for private availability.

I may or may not get something else (Sinovac or locally produced Astra Zeneca) through the public system before then, but again, the priority is older people, healthcare workers, underlying conditions.

The problem is availability, there simply aren't the vaccines. It's great in the US where there is a surplus and anyone who wants one can have it, and the only problem is anti-vaxxer nuts. Here's it's the exact opposite, we have one of the very [lowest rates of vaccine hesitancy](https://d6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net/prod/bb73e870-678c-11eb-9ef6-957656e4bb46-standard.png) in the world but [only 4% of people are vaccinated](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2020-03-01..latest&amp;pickerSort=asc&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;Metric=People+fully+vaccinated&amp;Interval=New+per+day&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=~THA). And that's entirely down to availability. It will resolve itself eventually, and the healthcare infrastructure here is actually great, they will be able to roll it out very fast when they actually have it, they were immediately doing 500,000/day from nothing when they actually got the first major shipment.

It largely failed in the market because of the combo of the blood clots and the bad subcontractor batches (the does it or doesn’t it against delta now wasn’t helping either) Right now a brief search turns up some demand in the US, mostly those who need it ASAP for travel/jobs to be classified as fully vaccinated or impatient/can’t be bothered/scared of mRNA.

Is it normal that people die there or not? I was born in Bosnia and in our country almost no one wears a mask and we are all still alive. Many dead people are called covid-dead, although they did not have covid. Back in Italy they called every dead person a covid-dead, without any autopsy, only with PCT-test, which we know today can be wrong. I do not deny Corona, but I do not believe that vaccination is good or safe. Every year 200 to 900 thousand people die from the flu, so we should have been wearing masks years ago. Every year 10 million people die of cancer and that is not given any attention at the moment. HIV can also be cured from a certain account balance, see Charlie Harper and Magic Johnson, and in Africa thousands die from it every year, who are not helped. I don't want to talk about all the senseless deaths in all the wars. But now they want all of a sudden only the best for us? When has ever a government wanted only the best for us? I think since Kennedy and Reagan, no president wanted to do something good. Would this be the first time they've lied to us? 


Here's another excerpt from a medical site:

The mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech was the first registered COVID-19 vaccine and has been shown to be up to 95% effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections. Little is known about the broad effects of the new class of mRNA vaccines, especially whether they have combined effects on innate and adaptive immune responses. Here we confirmed that BNT162b2 vaccination of healthy individuals induced effective humoral and cellular immunity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants. Interestingly, however, the BNT162b2 vaccine also modulated the production of inflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells upon stimulation with both specific (SARS-CoV-2) and non-specific (viral, fungal and bacterial) stimuli. The response of innate immune cells to TLR4 and TLR7/8 ligands was lower after BNT162b2 vaccination, while fungi-induced cytokine responses were stronger. In conclusion, the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine induces complex functional reprogramming of innate immune responses, which should be considered in the development and use of this new class of vaccines.

I feel I will get downvoted for this, but this is just plain wrong. Yes, covid does spread before symptoms. It also spreads during symptoms... So no, the statement that ""there is zero pressure to reduce the severity of disease"" is 100% wrong. I am actually shocked people upvoted this...

Sorry for the bluntness, I was trying to write more politely, but I just couldn't. Especially since this is fearmongering based on something completely unscientific, I feel people need to be more forward in challenging these views.

Actually, the more I think about it, the more upsetting this comment is. Not only is it wrong at face value, but also wrong under further scrutiny as well. For one, symptomatic people are more likely to stay at home, which would stop further infections.

The point is that they can have their time reduced by getting vaccinated, should they choose to agree to do so.  This is using civil service to commute a sentence.  It's legal, valid, and has been done a million times before.  

The sentence is 5 years probation.  The judge simply agreed to commute 4 years if they choose to get vaccinated.  It's up to them to choose. 

&gt;If we can use an unrelated condition to shorten probation time while still believing the shortened time is effective in achieving what probation seeks to achieve, doesn’t that mean the longer time was never necessary and we ought to shorten the probation time with or without the vaccine? If we believe the longer probation time DOES serve a purpose, aren’t we kneecapping the intended function of probation?

Not really.  It's a civil service.  That's what is reducing their probation.  

&gt;For example, if the point of a 3 year probation is to make sure an ex con has been throughly reformed and no longer poses a risk to the community, yet we are willing to shorten it to 2 years instead of 3 if they take the vaccine, it means either the 3 years was never necessary to begin with and they should shorten probation times accordingly with or without vaccination, OR we are saying the 3 years is necessary to keep the community safe, but if he takes the vaccine, then we will let him loose before we believe it is safe for the community.

That is not the point of probation.  The point of probation is to restrict freedoms and monitor behavior.  Rehabilitation is separate.

&gt;Vaccines have nothing to do with the intended function of probation and should not be tied to it in any way as a carrot or a stick.

Well, that's like, just your opinion, man.

&gt;That is, unless you believe we should just have a singular goal of increasing vaccination by any means necessary that any form of social engineering is justifiable.

&gt;Abstract  
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to evolve and recently emerging variants with substitutions in the Spike protein have led to growing concerns over increased transmissibility and decreased vaccine coverage due to immune evasion. Here, sera from recipients of a single dose of our Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine were tested for neutralizing activity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. All tested variants demonstrated susceptibility to Ad26.COV2.S-induced serum neutralization albeit mainly reduced as compared to the B.1 strain. Most pronounced reduction was observed for the B.1.351 (Beta; 3.6-fold) and P.1 (Gamma; 3.4-fold) variants that contain similar mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) while **only a 1.6-fold reduction was observed for the widely spreading B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant.**",,,1625196610,{},h3rhwih,False,t3_oc0nt7,False,True,t3_oc0nt7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oc0nt7/jjs_covid19_vaccine_shows_strong_activity_against/h3rhwih/,1625445328,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

However, that being said, the Nevada Hospital Association does not seem that concerned with this spike, especially compared to previous spikes.

That's the way it comes across to people.  Being vaccinated is sold as THE solution to allow people to get back to their normal lives.  If you tell them that they have to do the exact same thing they were doing BEFORE they were vaccinated, that's zero incentive to the holdouts.  


&gt;Why should we focus on them?


Because the adults that were like ""heck yeah, lets get vaccinated!"" have already been vaccinated.  The people that are absolutely dead-set to the core against vaccination you'll never be able to reach but there are plenty of fence sitters that you can reason with and the most reasonable incentive for them is to allow them to get back to what their lives largely were like pre-pandemic.

The study looks at data from Israel where the Russian Sputnik V is a much larger share. Above table 3 in the study it says:

""In the case of the Sputnik vaccine, one would thus have to vaccinate 22,000 people to prevent one death. In the case of the Moderna vaccine, one would have to vaccinate 3050 people to prevent one death. In the case of the Pfizer vaccine, 6150 vaccinated people would prevent one death""

That results in about 33 lives saved per 100,000 Moderna vaccines and 16 lives saved per 100,000 Pfizer vaccines. 

So if you kept all other numbers constant: 4 deaths per 100,000 vaccines administered (a cherry picked number by the author tbh). Things get alot more reasonable. 

Not to mention that the study seemed to only look at a time window of less than 2 months post-vaccination. Since vaccine effectiveness lasts much longer than 2 months, they likely save many more lives than those 33 and 16 numbers above.

There's a false narrative that Australia is somehow trying to keep covid out *forever*.

Literally no one thinks that here, that I know of anyway, despite how much the media says ""covid zero has to stop"".

The Prime Minister has only said what we've all known and said for a long time - chasing zero cases is something we do because you cannot stably maintain such a contagious virus in the community without pandemonium, without vaccines, *and we don't have those*.

Why media outlets keep on trotting out that this is some revelation, or that covid zero is somehow the policy failure here and not the Federal governments absurd decision to not purchase ***any*** mRNA vaccines before they were already in hot demand, is quite beyond me. I really don't know why they, or us, should let his government off for such an absurd failing, [penny pinching](https://www.michaelwest.com.au/governments-appalling-error-rejects-offer-of-40-million-pfizer-doses-in-july-2020/) with vaccines at the expense of lockdowns today. It's absurd.

Just listen to what [his predecessor](https://youtu.be/vdDFHWFktVc) has to say about it - IIRC, he cannot name a big failing of governance.

FWIW, it was the states that put together the wildly successful ""keeping covid out"" solution. The Feds have brought nothing to the table this pandemic besides financial support for businesses (and a tad for individuals), they're only just today, in June 2021, started considering to build dedicated quarantine facilities for stranded Australians, and they ""saved money"" by betting on only one horse in the vaccine race - AZ - along with a small side in the local option (UQ).

For a wealthy nation, we should have bet on the lot, and donated what we didn't use. The incompetence is just staggering...

Much of the reason is money — specifically, the lack of consistent and equitable government spending on health. According to the World Bank, just over 3 percent of the country’s gross domestic product goes toward health, one of the lowest such allocations in the world; its neighbor Afghanistan devotes nearly 10 percent. Per person, less than $45 is spent on health care annually in Pakistan, which relies heavily on foreign aid; in the United States, which has the highest per capita health care expenditures in the world, the amount is around $10,600. Life expectancy for the average Pakistani is 67 years, more than a decade shorter than it is for Americans. Pakistan, one of two countries that has not eradicated polio, also currently bears some of the heaviest burden from tuberculosis, at least in part because being H.I.V.-positive increases the risk, by roughly 20-fold, of developing the disease.
Yet many poorer countries manage to have better health outcomes than Pakistan by focusing on primary care and strengthening their public-health capacities. Allocating resources strategically and prioritizing hard-to-reach areas and marginalized groups can help ensure that access to services is not determined by geography or income. Active disease surveillance and prevention can blunt outbreaks, or at least stop health systems from becoming apathetic and dysfunctional when crises surface.
The vexing failure that can follow from neglecting to take these steps is nowhere more visible than it is in Ratodero. As of Nov. 30, an astonishing 1,132 children in the city and its environs were H.I.V.-positive, most of them under age 13. To put this in perspective, the equivalent figure for the entire United States is less than 2,000; the American population, 330 million, is a thousand times that of the Ratodero metropolitan area. (An additional 408 adults have also tested positive for the virus there.) The numbers in Ratodero are certainly higher now. Imran Arbani and local journalists compiled a list of children who have died from H.I.V. since the outbreak began; 48 is their current tally.

As the end of the pandemic seems to be coming into sight, the riddle of H.I.V. in Pakistan is a crucial one to unravel in order to understand how to resume progress on global health in the post-Covid era. The previous headway made against some of the world’s deadliest infectious diseases isn’t guaranteed to continue. Even in favorable socioeconomic conditions, drugs and programs can’t make up for a weak health care infrastructure. The pandemic has strained, if not wrecked, many countries’ health systems and left many people poor and vulnerable — a reality that Ratodero has long been reckoning with.",,,1625248490,{},h3txyl2,False,t3_oc597j,False,False,t1_h3txmhc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oc597j/thousands_jabbed_with_unknown_substances_at_fake/h3txyl2/,1625490826,27,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Eman, it turned out, was not the first young child infected with the virus in Ratodero, where more than 300,000 people live. Shah’s friend’s son received the same diagnosis two years before. In each case, the parents tested negative for H.I.V.

In 2020, about 2.8 million people worldwide under the age of 20 were living with H.I.V.; over half of them were younger than 10, according to UNAIDS, the United Nations H.I.V. program. In a vast majority of these cases, the infection was acquired through vertical transmission, meaning an H.I.V.-positive mother passed the virus to her child during pregnancy or delivery or while breastfeeding. It was unusual that these two children in Ratodero had H.I.V. when their parents did not. Nor did either child have a chronic disease that would require rounds of blood transfusions or routine kidney dialysis, which could possibly expose them to blood-borne illnesses. The two previous major outbreaks in the area — one among drug users who used needles and another among patients at a contaminated dialysis center — involved higher-risk populations.
After Eman’s diagnosis, Arbani began testing many more of the sick children he saw for H.I.V. Within a matter of months, he had identified 14 pediatric patients with H.I.V. All of them were younger than 10.



The big three infectious diseases that plague the world — H.I.V., tuberculosis and malaria — cause more than 2.3 million deaths a year, disproportionately in poorer countries. Until the coronavirus pandemic, though, the overall trend with these diseases was a cause for optimism. Two-thirds of the world’s 38 million H.I.V. patients are now getting treatment, and their expected life spans have been lengthening significantly in recent years, as doctors have increasingly figured out how to forestall acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or late-stage H.I.V. At the same time, infection rates have been in decline, thanks to advocacy, well-directed funding and smart public-health efforts: New H.I.V. infections have been reduced by nearly a quarter since 2010.
Remarkable advances have been made against malaria too over the last two decades. Deaths caused by the disease have dropped by 44 percent. In 2019, the first malaria vaccine was distributed in sub-Saharan Africa. This is also the region of the world where the largest gains have been made against H.I.V. And while the global campaign against tuberculosis has had less success — in large part because of the emergence of multiple-drug-resistant strains of the bacterium responsible for the disease — progress has nevertheless been steady, with a drop in deaths of nearly 15 percent over the last five years.
Now another virus has been threatening to undo this progress. Over the course of barely a year, the coronavirus has infected more than 120 million people worldwide, directly claiming the lives of more than 2.7 million. Coronavirus infections have disrupted medical services, scrambled drug-supply chains and necessitated the redeployment of public-health staff. According to the Global Fund, an international organization that finances health initiatives, about 75 percent of H.I.V. programs have already been moderately or severely disrupted.

This has dire implications: UNAIDS estimates that even a six-month interruption of antiretroviral therapy for 20 percent of people would result in more than 110,000 additional deaths. In a September study in The Lancet Global Health, researchers modeled the impact of Covid-19 on H.I.V., tuberculosis and malaria. Over the next five years, in low- and middle-income countries where these diseases are highly prevalent, deaths could increase up to 10 percent for H.I.V., 20 percent for tuberculosis and 36 percent for malaria.
For these reasons, Mishal Khan, a policy analyst at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who studies Pakistan’s health system, says she doesn’t want “everything to be about Covid, because it’s not like the other issues will go away.” They’ll just “get neglected,” she adds, because even infectious diseases that have been “taking lives for decades” haven’t been tracked as closely as Covid-19. The diversion of resources from H.I.V. and other health conditions to the pandemic inevitably affects the most vulnerable. As António Guterres, the U.N. secretary general, warns in a UNAIDS Global Report, H.I.V. and Covid-19 have each exposed “our world’s fragilities — including persistent economic and social inequalities and woefully inadequate investments in public health.”


In Pakistan, H.I.V. numbers have long been trending in the wrong direction. The most recent data indicate that only 21 percent of those infected with H.I.V. in Pakistan are aware of their status. According to UNAIDS, there are an estimated 190,000 H.I.V.-positive people in the country, and only 12 percent of them receive treatment. As a result, there has been a 385 percent increase in H.I.V.-related deaths in Pakistan since 2010. Sub-Saharan Africa, in contrast, has had a 45 percent decline over that same period. Pakistan has one of the fastest-rising rates of infection in Asia and the Pacific.",,,1625248351,{},h3txmhc,False,t3_oc597j,False,False,t1_h3twjw4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oc597j/thousands_jabbed_with_unknown_substances_at_fake/h3txmhc/,1625490632,27,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Magic Johnson did seemingly beat HIV. And no government is innocent or acts entirely in the interest of its people (and especially not for people from other countries).

In fact, I read something a few weeks ago that said something like everyone acts entirely for their own self interest. I guess that means we act in a way so that we get what we want or so that we can feel good? Or when we're in immediate danger, then we act just to survive. It's a psychological theory but it made a lot of sense to me. By commenting here, I am also acting in my own self interest.
  
  &amp;nbsp;  
  
But anyways, I see a lot of these governments as doing the same thing. The biggest self interest for every government is for the economy to do well because that is how countries survive and thrive. And to do that they need able-bodied people to be working productively all the time. With that perspective, the whole covid thing makes sense.

It's dangerous enough to the world economy that all countries are pushing for global vaccination. It's why all the rich countries are donating vaccines to the rest of the world, of course only after most of their own people are vaccinated. 



As for some of your other points, covid has killed many times more people than the flu so far, even with lockdowns everywhere. And we do have a flu shot that gets updated every year. Millions die from cancer, but survival rates for all cancers are increasing, even though they are not great especially for certain cancers. I'm not going to comment on everything because you're not lying about anything.

I think the difference is mostly in our perspectives. The way I see it is that people/doctors/pharma companies/governments are all going about acting in their self interest.

That's always going to be true though.  This virus is endemic, its not going away now, six months from now, or sixty years from now.  Your grandchildren or great grandchildren will likely be dealing with Covid-19.   Zero Covid is a fantasy.   This virus is far too contagious and has already spread around the entire globe, we'll never simply just eliminate it.   


People are either going to get vaccinated or they will eventually be infected.  Its that simple.  The current vaccines offer us the best protection possible but they will never be 100% effective and people who are immunocompromised and especially vulnerable to severe cases will require additional boosters and have to continue to take special precautions as they did prior to this pandemic.   

On the other hand, if you force vaccinated people to wear masks, it reduces the incentive for the holdouts to get vaccinated.  

""Get out there and get vaccinated and live under the exact same conditions as you were living before vaccination"" is not exactly a knock it out of the park marketing slogan.   



  We should be doing everything possible to encourage people that they can return to something close to a pre-2020 normal if they get vaccinated while also clearly identifying the dangers associated of not being vaccinated, no different than some of the public health campaigns against smoking.   I like the way the governor of West Virginia put it, that if you're not getting vaccinated, you're playing the death lottery.
