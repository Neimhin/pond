experience with other vaccines any potential interference is most likely to result in a slightly
attenuated immune response to one of the vaccines. There is no evidence of any safety
concerns, although it may make the attribution of any adverse events more difficult.
Because of the absence of data on co-administration with COVID-19 vaccines, it should
not be routine to offer appointments to give this vaccine at the same time as other
vaccines. Based on current information about the first COVID-19 vaccines being deployed,
scheduling should ideally be separated by an interval of at least 7 days to avoid incorrect
attribution of potential adverse events.

So all we can do in the meanwhile is keep testing and checking how well it is working at the moment, or sit on our asses for 12+2 weeks before we discuss how both doses perform; I think the choice is obvious. It matters to see how they are performing at a midpoint, because it is if nothing else an indicator to see how they might perform in the long term.

And regarding stability, and effectiveness, be vary of over-simplifications. The numbers shared (67, 82, 93 percent) are, as you can see in this thread by other people and relevant sources, based on different studies, in different environments. Also they are mostly based on the phase 3 or phase 4 studies, which are realistically a small subset of the population (I think around 25k, not sure). We have different strains, and some vaccines' effectivenes depend on the strain: you can see how this could skew results in favor, or agains any specific vaccine. Apparently J&amp;J is much better at the South African variant than most others (including Pfizer/Biotech).

Apparently, both AZ and Pfizer are having very similar real-life effect rates in the UK, where both are administered, but I am not sure what the numbers are.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Continue to follow the guidelines even after the second dose. It is my understanding that any vaccine, including this one, helps with the immune system, as in, it does not prevent infection, but symptoms/death. So it basically might be making you a *certainly asymptomatic* carrier, and your body might kill the virus fast(er), but not fast enough to stop spreading, so we should all keep wearing masks and such until herd immunity is achieved (and not until me or you get vaccinated).

Lying to the public never works. The public finds out, and it kills your credibility.

A message of “masking is critical, but please don’t go buy N-95 because healthcare workers need them more” would have worked. The same people who were buying up N-95s still would have bought them, and the same people donating them to hospitals still would have. But a several month head start on masking would have made a huge difference.

My area has had much lower case rates than the surrounding ones. A part of that is that local women got organized in early March, and started making thousands of masks. The entire county got really good masks that way, earlier on.

Quality of masks definitely affects willingness to wear them too. The difference between wearing a well firing one and a shitty one is huge.

Yes, the last guy (I’m guessing this subs overactive auto mod won’t like his name) did the most damage to the US effort, and bringing 500,000 manslaughter charges against him would be more than reasonable.

But that doesn’t excuse the WHO and CDC fuckups.

The refusal to say that covid was airborne for months was about as bad as the masking debacle. Every other coronavirus is, but instead they had people freaking out about surface spread and doing cleaning theater, when what mattered was ventilation. Again, the ripple effects of that decision has a massive death toll.

The UK didn't have much manufacturing capacity but realized it would need it and invested heavily last year. What did Canada do? Nothing. 

&gt;To understand the problem, we need to go back to the 1980s. At that time, the government-owned Connaught Labs was producing vaccines here in Canada and decision-making was in the public realm. But Connaught was partially privatized and then finally allowed to be sold to the French company Merieux (now part of Sanofi) by the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney.

&gt;Fast forward to the 2000s, when Québec-based vaccine manufacturer IAF BioChem went through a couple of sales and ended up being owned by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).

Yes, I absolutely believe that we should do more in regards to getting the population vaccinated.

If primary and secondary schools required it for attendance, I wouldn't bat an eye.

If employers started paying $100 to employee's who got the influenza shot, I'd be happy.

If employers started requiring it for employment?  Works for me.

If public employers negotiating it into their agreements with unions that influenza vaccination was mandatory, that would receive kudos from me.

A federal or state government wanted to use tax dollars to make the influenza vaccine free for everyone?  Full support from me.

As a society, we don't take influenza seriously enough.  We should do more and I have hope that maybe we can work on some mRNA vaccines for influenza that can be produced with lower lead times than the current egg-based production so that scientists can more accurately predict the likely strains.  With higher efficacies, I think we'll get more people willing to get influenza shots and we would be able to reduce the loss of life from influenza.

&gt;If you get the vaccine, go to Disney and live your life happily finally and forget about the pandemic.

[],,Louis_Farizee,,,[],,,,text,t2_6mvei,False,False,[],"“Harm reduction” is the idea that overly restrictive recommendations lead to low compliance and, paradoxically, spreading the virus faster, because humanity has a limited amount of patience. 

We learned this (slowly, painfully) during the AIDS crisis. Obviously the only *real* way to end the spread of AIDS would be for mass abstinence, but that’s not going to happen. And as soon as people started figuring that out, they threw all caution to the wind and started having risky sex, because “virus gonna virus” (sound familiar?). Eventually, the medical establishment realized that normalizing condom use and regular HIV testing, while less than ideal, was a lot easier for regular people to follow, which led to much higher compliance, which is what helped slow the contagion enough for treatments to be developed. 

Widespread extended lockdown is the only way to stop COVID in its tracks, but it’s simply too hard for a lot of people to comply with. We can debate whose fault that is, we can rage at how selfish people are, but it’s a true statement of fact. Widespread extended lockdown is simply too hard for a lot of people to comply with. Knowing what we know about harm reduction, we could have said “obviously staying home is the safest course of action, but here’s other stuff you can do to slow down the spread of COVID” (including and especially masks) and allowed schools, businesses, and entertainments to reopen at limited capacity after the first two or three weeks of lockdowns, we would have had a much higher rate of compliance and COVID wouldn’t have spread as fast or as far as it did. 

Instead, we have a bunch of people who believe that “virus gonna virus”, because they’ve been led to believe that the only things they can do to stop COVID are things they personally find too difficult to comply with, so they abandon *all* preventive measures, including masks.

""Although the induction of antispike nAbs is the key component for an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, it is well known that T cells, and particularly TFH cells, are critical to generate antibody-producing plasma cells and long-lived memory B cells. In patients with COVID-19, high nAb titers correlated with strong CD4+ T cell responses, and the lack of functional TFH cells reacting against SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be detrimental... A final issue to consider is whether high quantities of vaccine-induced CD8+ T cells at local sites need to be elicited by future vaccine candidates. If the initial group of vaccines in clinical trials that are primarily focused on generating an effective nAb response provides recipients with long-standing protection, then it may not be necessary to invest in such efforts. However, if problems emerge in the vaccinated population with breakthrough infections, waning antibody levels after vaccination, and/or the emergence of new viral strains, then it would be wise to reconsider vaccine approaches specifically designed to induce functional CD8+ TRM responses in the upper respiratory tract.""",,,1618505474,{},gumg116,False,t3_mr9fq0,False,True,t1_gume6w2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mr9fq0/daily_discussion_thread_april_15_2021/gumg116/,1618508878,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Even if you get infected and then recover you'd then still have some level of resistance or immunity for a time, so it doesn't necessarily have to be everyone vaccinated. You can still have some people who could catch it, the idea is just that they won't come in contact with someone else who has it and thus once they recover and are no longer able to spread it that chain of infections dies off. Even just people using masks can help with that as even coming into contact won't guarantee the virus spreading to a new host.

I agree however that it's a seemingly unlikely outcome, particularly with the various mutations that are increasingly contagious making it harder to prevent their spread. The only upside in that respect is that generally speaking viruses grow increasingly resilient and contagious while often becoming less deadly at the same time. When viruses are too deadly they can disable and kill their hosts before they can spread which works against them eventually as they can't survive on their own without a host. Not to say this is necessary what has been happening or would eventually happen with Covid but it's possible.

I definitely agree with the sentiment that it's likely Covid just becomes a recurring ""seasonal"" virus akin to the flu that requires regular shots to keep up resistance to variants while never truly being killed off.

In regards to younger children and such not getting the vaccine currently my understanding is that the main reason for this is that it's a combination of lower risk for serious conditions from actually catching covid combined with simply not having enough data on potential side effects of the vaccine in these age groups. The initial test groups did not include younger age groups and thus while it's largely believed that the vaccines would be safe for them we're waiting on further testing to ensure this.

You can easily see how your method fails in practice. For example, the risk of measles is very very low. No one should be vaccinated because vaccines have more risk according to your simplistic method. 

Epidemiology 101, you must know how contagious a disease is in order to assess risk. Measles, is actually incredibly contagious with an R value 12-18. Covid has an R value around 4, and it's only a matter of time before your 1/10 is 4/10 and then 10/10. 

The math gets even more complicated. Pfizer and Moderna are supplying approximately 23 million vaccine doses per month to the US vs 7 million J&amp;J.

The viable alternative here is delaying your covid vaccination for a vaccine with a fairly inconsequential risk. There are risks associated with that action too, by the way, to not only the vaccine taker but to other they might unwittingly spread the virus to, especially for peoples whos ability to successfully isolate is getting restricted, for the wellbeing of people who are stuck isolating longer as the vaccine rollout is delayed by people being particular over their vaccine. 

We were ignoring these additional risk factor for the sake of keeping the conversation simple, if you want to start prodding at 'refusing to investigate further' you're only going to see your argument become less and less viable.

Increasing my chances of dying this year from 0.8% to 0.8005% is not something i would consider a big deal.

But more than that, you're entire argument is flawed. IT relies on the idea that any path with risk is inherently stupid to take. Getting a dog increases your chances of being hurt by a dog. Swimming in a pool increases your chances of drowning. Owning a kitchen knife increases your chance of knife related injuries.

Instead of mortality / side effects / long term effects (off both) in general.

Yes, AZ might have a higher risk of CVTs than Pfizer/Biontech, and yes, it might ""only be n times less than the risk of those from Covid"" – but Covid can cause death / hospitalization / long term lung or neural damage / ""Long Covid"" / watever IN ADDITION to blood clots / CVTs.  And yep, even in ""the young and healthy"" (although with lower probability than in the elderly / other groups at risk – but still quite a bit).

Sounds really fucking short-sighted thinking to me.

Yeah, it might be best if everyone would get ""the good vaccine"", but not everyone can (ask Europe or even better, ask ""poorer countries) and in really the very most cases even ""the bad one"" sooner is still much better than getting Covid and dying from blood clots or any of the other many ways it can kill you – or suffering from any of the long term effects.

On top of that: Getting yourself vaccinated sooner does not only protect your individual sorry corpse, it also protects others by reducing potential for further spread (and mutations) and of course protecting those who cannot get vaccinated or whose immune system cannot build as effective an immune response with the vaccine (""vaccine non responders"" is the term, iirc.).

Otherwise the groups become skewed by comparison as children only counts humans 0-18 and Adults counts every human above 18 yo.

That said, yes children are less susceptible. However we do need to begin to expect and plan for the effects of the vaccine on adults, lessening restrictions in general and their effects on spread, the expected rise in cases among children, etc.

We need to try to assess the difference masks and social distancing have had thus far on the spread of covid among children and what it will be without them.

No, it's just ""avoid crowds and wear masks until cases drop significantly and we find out if people who are vaccinated can still spread the virus""  

This isn't complicated. The goal is to reduce the spread of the virus because the more it spreads the more we risk a variant emerging that either spreads faster, does more harm/kills more people, or evades the immune system of even vaccinated people.  The CDC says that vaccinated people can travel and see friends/family (if also vaccinated) in their homes without masks or distancing.

Let's use a grocery store example. You're all vaccinated, great! Me too. So say either of us want to to to the grocery store, but don't want to wear a mask. After all, we're both vaccinated, and if others aren't, not our problem right? Well, what happens when some jackass who isn't taking this seriously, and doesn't plan to get vaccinated gets to the store, sees us walking around without masks? He's going to say ""fuck this, I'm not wearing one either."" And now there's a greater risk of spread to others who maybe do want to get vaccinated, but haven't been able to yet, because after all, masks do more to prevent you from spreading illness than they do to protect you from illness, unless you're wearing a properly fitted N95 mask.

Now imagine that keeps up for a while, and a new variant emerges that our vaccines aren't so great against. Back to everyone wearing masks. You want that?

It's all good, I enjoy a heated and passionate discussion.

We know vaccines are 95% effective for Pfizer and Moderna. We know people can still asymptomatically carry and spread. 

We know variants can develop and that can evade vaccines. Why push it?

**No one is saying indefinitely.** Why are people hearing that?

The original comment is arguing that they're emotional gut feeling trumps the CDC. The CDC is being rational as a public health advisor.

Anyone re-opening at this point isn't doing it for public health reasons. Right? Every single public health official has been consistent about that. No one in public health was yelling, ""time to end your mask mandates"" at Texas. There's not just a public health angle to this thing. We've had way more death than necessary for the last year because a lot of America has prioritized the p-word you can't talk about here over public health.

That's all. And we all have different risk tolerances and ideas about what kind of loses we think are acceptable.

People have their own risk tolerances, and one can't really argue with another's personal risk tolerance.

This is really all it is for me.

&gt;You're comments went far beyond that though.

So for that specific comment you quoted, that's a fair criticism of yours to make. My intent was a reaction towards how... unsympathetic it felt to me to just say, *oh well let's just give those to India and we, the '1st world' will get the mRNA*. However, after considering it, I realize these people were more likely saying that the cost/benefit for these countries that are facing much worse infection rates than we currently are would likely make the nominal risk worthwhile. Especially if they may not have access to mRNA vaccines any time soon.

I acknowledge that I likely misinterpreted that.

&gt;Or where the CDC said the J&amp;J was ""irresponsibly developed""?

What I was pointing towards is that **if** it turns out that they knew there was a risk of blood clotting than that would be highly irresponsible. As they could have simply moved over to mRNA full-time.

Still, I should have been more careful about splitting my specific issues away from those I was basing off the CDC reports.

&gt;Also stop acting like the CDC / experts are some monolithic entity. If you listened to the meeting today, there were plenty of experts saying the J&amp;J decision is a disaster. The whole resolution of the meeting making no recommendation is because the committee couldn't come to a decision due to internal disagreement. There were clearly members that wanted to immediately resume for certain demographics due to the relative risks.

Okay sure, but I think we can both agree that putting a simple halt was the responsible move here. There is a clear, albeit small trend. It is the FDA and the CDC's responsibilities to ensure that medication and vaccinations reach certain standards prior to public consumption. Again, these are vaccinations that may reach the billions. If 1 in 40,000 is relatively close, that's a massive loss of life. One that could be avoided by altering our path forward in regard to vaccinations.

One thing I want to make completely clear, I am pro-vaccination here. This isn't the polio vaccine though.

This is absolutely the case.  Once you have the opportunity to get the vaccine and you decide not to, it's over for you.  At that exact moment, it's no longer anyone's responsibility to protect you from this - you made your decision, you live with it.  And once the vaccine is readily available enough that that describes 99% of people, then... we're done.

There are a couple of major caveats with that though -

* The vaccine has to actually be available.  I believe Michigan, for example, just opened its eligibility to all adults like one week ago and it's still really hard to get an appointment in most places.  So plenty of people there still have not had a reasonable opportunity to get it.

* There is a lag time of ~5 weeks to actually be immunized (or at least 2+ weeks for the decent protection of the first dose).  It's not reasonable to open eligibility to everyone and then immediately go ""k lol vaccine is available, pandemic is over"" because people need a bit of time to get an appointment and then actually become  immunized once they've received it.

But when all is said and done, it doesn't matter whether we reach herd immunity or not.  Once 99% of American adults have had the chance to get immunized, then I don't see any legitimate argument that we should continue living like this, whether or not we've reached that big 70% or 80% or whatever.",,,1618460300,{},gukk87f,False,t3_mr2sw5,False,False,t1_guk02fp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mr2sw5/more_covid_state_shutdowns_unlikely_despite_cdc/gukk87f/,1618468992,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

“By midnight, everyone in California ages 16 and up will be eligible to book COVID-19 vaccine appointments on the state’s MyTurn appointment system.

The changes to the system were expected to go into effect sometime late Wednesday and be completed before midnight. At that point, the rest of California’s counties will join the rest of the state in allowing all adults, as well as 16- and 17-year-olds, to book COVID-19 vaccine appointments.

In Southern California, residents of Orange and Ventura counties ages 16 and up will be newly eligible to book vaccine appointments through MyTurn. Los Angeles, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Imperial counties have already made everyone 16 and older eligible.

Residents of the following counties will also be eligible to book appointments for everyone 16 and up through the MyTurn site by Thursday morning: In the Bay Area, residents of Santa Clara, San Mateo, Sonoma, Solano, Marin and Napa counties; in the San Joaquin Valley, residents of San Joaquin and Tulare counties; in the Sacramento area, residents of Sacramento and El Dorado counties; and on the Central Coast, Monterey, Santa Cruz and San Benito counties.

All residents 16 and up of Tuolumne, Siskiyou, Amador, Lassen, Glenn, Del Norte, Colusa, Inyo, Mariposa, Modoc, Sierra and Alpine counties will also gain access to appointments.

MyTurn officials said the online system can handle up to 300,000 transactions per hour, and that they expect it to handle demand.

Officials planned to release a new version of the MyTurn website Wednesday night with the new eligibility and include language support for the first time in Arabic and Farsi. People can also make appointments by phone at (833) 422-4255, with language support for more than 200 languages.

The MyTurn website is an attempt by the state to produce a main gateway to find and schedule appointments, but sometimes, not all available appointments show up in the MyTurn system. Alternate ways to book appointments include through healthcare providers, such as Kaiser, and pharmacies that offer vaccines, such as CVS, Ralphs, Rite Aid, Walgreens, Costco, and Albertsons/Vons/Safeway/Pavilions.

The city of Los Angeles has a separate vaccine appointment portal, operated by Carbon Health, that is not integrated into the MyTurn system.

All vaccines are free to everyone living in the U.S., regardless of immigration or health insurance status.

This is all because insurance companies want to negotiate discounts with service providers in exchange for making them in-network and sending them customers. Hospitals can't really afford discounts, so they instead jack up the base price and then discount it back to what they actually want to charge.

Now understand that there are a lot of insurance companies, and they each have lots of different groups, and each of those gets different negotiated rates, etc. All those rates are secret because insurance companies don't want their competitors to know what they're paying.

Because the hospitals inflate their prices to made up numbers, huge numbers of insured people can't afford their bills. The hospital makes up for this by passing the cost on to insurance companies for the insured and we're now in a vicious cycle of price inflation.

They made the point that it wasn’t the initial intent. Which it wasn’t. The initial intent of any of the vaccines was to reduce severity of symptoms and reduce hospitalization.

You're comments went far beyond that though.

Many poor countries do not have any mRNA vaccines available.  They absolutely must consider the balance of risks because there isn't a readily available alternative like the US has. This is what I was specifically addressing.  Also, point me to where the CDC said the vax was dangerous? Or where the CDC said the J&amp;J was ""irresponsibly developed""?

Like you said, the chance of getting covid is at play here. The 1/10 number is after a years time, and shouldn’t be used to compare your chances today while you wait. 

The latest numbers I saw was 70k more confirmed cases out of 230m people. So the current rate is 0.03% of the total population was infected. But since 30M already have been infected, it’s 0.035% of possible people (assuming no reinfections). 

But then there are people who are vaccinated. Do we remove the 123M that have had one shot (0.09% rate)? Or the 69M that have gotten both (0.053% rate)? 

And like you pointed out, you can reduce your chances of being infected by social distancing, masking, etc. and the infected rate number should go down as people are vaccinated. 

But there is the issue where if everyone is now delayed 30 days to get a vaccine due to the reduced supply, it means more infections not just for those people, but additional infections as it spreads. 

Personally, I think the real question should be looked at at a country or world view. We need a few data points. One is if we have AZ / JJ vaccines, how many people get covid now till herd immunity. Second is if we pull AZ / JJ, how many people get covid now till herd immunity. And finally, if we keep AZ / JJ, how many people get blood clots.

How would you get to that conclusion? Especially since Pfizer/Biontech did not even take any upfront money for development of the vaccine or infrastructure, except 500 Million € from the EU and Germany, that as far as i know, had no sort of exclusivity attached. The reason Pfizer does not export from the US is not that they got an especially sweet deal, its that there is an executive order that orders for all Americans to be vaccinated first before there can be exports. Its also why there are 10s of millions of AZ doses sitting in the US even though its not even approved there.

&gt; But I'm struggling to understand why citizens of a ""smaller"" country like Canada, which has chosen not to invest in its own production capacity or work with manufacturers to set some up, deserves ""equal access"" to something another country spent billions to produce. 

My whole point is that it is simply not feasible for every nation of 10 million + people to have production sites for every single kind of vaccine. Would Belgium be especially smart for having a giant Pfizer mRNA production site in their country and simply banning export before all Belgians are vaccinated? Is Canada dumb for having a Sanofi/GSK site instead? If Sanofi/GSK would be the big winner of the vaccine race, should Canada ban exports to any other nation and pad itself on the shoulder for its superior vaccine investment strategy over those Belgian mRNA idiots?


&gt; Canada has the money and they could've done what Israel did but they chose not to.

Think this through. Everyone has this brilliant idea to simply pay what Israel did. Everyone simply pays more. Instead of 50 billion profit, Pfizer now makes 100 Billion. Do you think that leads to any noticeable improvement in vaccine supply? All the vaccine manufacturing in the world is maxed. There is little you can do to improve supply in complicated supply chains over such short time frames. Just look at the giant mess the chip industry is in right now, which has very similar issues.

I agree with your takeaway though.

That bogus number came from the trials that were mostly done with younger people who were not going to die in the first place.  Some of them had zero PLACEBO COVID deaths!  Would you therefore conclude that the PLACEBO prevents 100% of deaths?

[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson-vaccines-compared/618226/](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson-vaccines-compared/618226/)

 

The two vaccine trials that did explicitly report hospitalizations as an efficacy outcome make this latter issue very clear. For the [AstraZeneca](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf) vaccine, one person in the control group had severe COVID-19, but eight people were hospitalized; for [Johnson &amp; Johnson](https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download), 34 people in the placebo group had severe COVID-19, but only five people were hospitalized. It’s true that zero vaccinated people were hospitalized in either study after the vaccines took effect. But with numbers that small, you can’t draw a reliable conclusion about how high efficacy may be for these outcomes. 

As Diana Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research [pointed out](https://www.center4research.org/testimony-of-dr-diana-zuckerman-of-nchr-before-the-fda-advisory-committee-on-j-j-covid-vaccine/) about the Johnson &amp; Johnson trial, **“It’s misleading to tell the public that nobody who was vaccinated was hospitalized unless you also tell them that only 5 people in the placebo group were hospitalized.”** She’s right. And you can’t be confident about predicting effectiveness precisely in a wider population outside the trial, either. For example, some of the vaccine trials included relatively few people older than 60 as participants.

You can see how fragile these numbers are by looking at those compiled for severe disease. **In the** [**Pfizer trial**](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download)**, for example, just one vaccinated person developed severe COVID-19 versus three in the placebo group—which meant that a single bout of disease made the difference between a calculated efficacy rate of 66 percent and one of 100 percent.** 

For the [Novavax](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3) and [Oxford-AstraZeneca](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf) trials, there were zero people with severe disease in the vaccinated group versus only one in the control group, so adding or subtracting one would have been even more dramatic. **The problem is even greater for deaths. For that efficacy analysis, only two of the vaccine trials—for Moderna’s and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s—reported any COVID-19 deaths at all in the control groups.**",,,1618492434,{},gulna13,False,t3_mr68mh,False,True,t1_gul4pth,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mr68mh/cdc_reports_5800_covid_infections_in_fully/gulna13/,1618492447,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It can spread through the air, and remain viable in the air for hours. Airborne spread allows the virus to float freely on its own, as a viral particle.

Droplet spread is different and it isn’t airborne. The virus is coated in respiratory secretions, mucus, or saliva, so it can’t exactly float in the air the way an airborne virus can. The liquid surrounding the viral particles falls to the ground, taking the virus with it. The virus can’t survive well after the liquids around it evaporate, which is one reason it’s unlikely to become infected by touching a surface then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. The droplet, though it travels through air for a short distance, is not considered airborne.

Covid can (and does) aerosolize and become airborne. It happens when a patient in the hospital is having a breathing tube taken out, because of the techniques used in the procedure. It’s a really specific scenario to the hospital setting, though. In the “real world”, or day to day life, it would be very unlikely for you to encounter the virus in an airborne state — for example, if you walk into an unoccupied room, you are unlikely to become infected by virus in the air leftover from people in the same room an hour before.

Personally, I had a mild headache, sore arm and felt sleepy for less than a day, and had some nausea that came and went for a while but was very mild with Pfizer for the 1st shot. 2nd shot, my arm was pretty sore, slight headache, and I was really tired; that lasted about a day and a half. My SO got Pfizer as well and had literally no side effects on the 2nd shot, and a slight sore arm on the 1st. This is anecdotal, but I know literally dozens of people who've gotten Pfizer or Moderna, and a handful who got J&amp;J, and none of them had any serious side effects. Most had little to no side effects, and the ones who had fever/chills etc. took some acetaminophen and were back to normal within 24-48 hrs.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WPRI) — Local health officials are putting out a warning that even if a person is fully vaccinated against COVID-19, they still need to be careful to prevent contracting and transmitting the virus.

In a meeting Tuesday of Rhode Island’s COVID-19 vaccine subcommittee, officials said out of those currently immunized, 0.13% have since tested positive.

**“For us to actually be experiencing 0.1% of vaccinated individuals demonstrated breakthrough cases, it’s even better than what is noted nationally and what’s happened with the clinical trials,”** R.I. Department of Health Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott explained.

&gt;There is a misconception that children are at zero risk for Covid, says Dr Fatima Marinho, who is also a senior adviser to the international health NGO Vital Strategies. Marinho's research has found that a shockingly high number of children and babies have been affected by the virus.

&gt;Between February 2020 and 15 March 2021, Covid-19 killed at least 852 of Brazil's children up to the age of nine, including 518 babies under one year old, according to figures from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. But Dr Marinho estimates that more than twice this number of children died of Covid. A serious problem of underreporting due to lack of Covid testing is bringing the numbers down, she says.

 &gt;Dr Marinho calculated the excess of deaths by unspecified acute respiratory syndrome during the pandemic, and found that there were 10 times more deaths by unexplained respiratory syndrome than in previous years. By adding these numbers, she estimates that the virus in fact killed 2,060 children under nine years old, including 1,302 babies.

Don't think you can say for sure about everyone, all age groups/genders etc,  unless you know better than the PEI in Germany, or the health authorities in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, etc...

They didn't stop using it for no reason in the under 60 age group here in Germany and I really wish these posts that go out of their way to minimise the risk, would make it clear that they don't really know the exact incidence rate any more than the people that might inflate the incidence of the blood clots.

Later in the autumn and traditional 'flu season', were we had a delayed (compared to EU) peak, maybe that caused people to relax, but because spread was incresing - so has the mitigation steps been doing too during december, and that re-initiated effort begun showing effect until currently when the more transmissable mutation has more or less taken over.  


I would say it's in the balance still to introduce stricter yet recommendations/mitigations, but increasingly more unlikely as vaccinations are progressing pretty well.

&gt; A man took his adult children to receive COVID-19 vaccinations over the weekend, knowing it was important for them to be immunized against the disease.

&gt; But he didn’t feel concerned about his own risk of catching the virus, despite the fact that older people and men are more likely to die from COVID-19, Barbara Ferrer, L.A. County’s public health director, said this week. He had not made plans to get vaccinated.

&gt; “I was worried about him, and so were his children,” said Ferrer, who encountered the family at a Los Angeles vaccination site. “What’s staggering to realize is that the very group of folks who have the higher mortality rate are now also the group of folks that have the lower vaccination rates.”



&gt; Throughout the pandemic, men worldwide have been far more likely to die from COVID-19 — because of a mix of biological and behavioral factors — but also less likely to have been vaccinated against the disease.

&gt; The data from L.A. County paints a troubling picture: Here, 153 of every 100,000 women have died from COVID-19, while 289 of every 100,000 men have.

&gt; But while 44% of women in L.A. County have received at least one dose of a vaccine, only 30% of men have.

I don't think we're going to crack 90%, I'd find it very surprising, but I think we're in a fantastic spot for that population. I expect that deaths from them are going to approach irrelevancy very shortly, which is just amazing to say considering Americans over 65 contributed to around 80% of American deaths. We're in a great position right now, I'm very optimistic.

Another nice milestone is that 30% of American adults are *fully* vaccinated. I expect it to be one in three before the end of the week. We're also at a seven day deaths average of 764, and I predict that it will continue to decline due to the most vulnerable members of the population nearing a ""completed"" vaccination effort. I think that soon we're going to reach the lowest it's been since the first wave. That number would be a seven day average of 547, which happened on July 7. Obviously hundreds of people dying every day isn't *good,* but I think it will be very uplifting for the vaccination effort to put us in a position where less people are dying of this than before it all began. It's a bit of a psychological victory and I'm excited about it.

There is no risk of a world was 3 occuring because it hasnt happened and is not falsifiable to say there is.

Aliens havent visited and since you cant prove they exist until they do, the risk of that happening is literally 0.

I face no risk of loss if I bet against the Bengals winning the superbowl, because ""the bengals could do it someday"" is not falsifiable, as we have never witnessed it and I cannot say there is a chance. 

Youre completly right, those are claims that make a valid hypothesis. You can look for evidence to prove them wrong. They are also completely wrong. That a claim fits the framework of the scientific method does not mean that it is reasonable to use in a statistical setting. The fact that your falsifiable claim *can* be proved wrong means that by definition, there is risk. You would need to manage to prove your claims for that risk to to away, and the fact thay a few women got it does not prove that men cannot get it. The fact that youre asserting that ""men cannot get clora from covid"" requires the scientific process implies that there is still a risk factor for men. Your hypothesis is also built on assumptions and limited information, its questionable to begin with. The less information, cases, studies, test, the less confidence you can speak of regarding risk. To say a risk is zero is a pretty damn weighty claim. What I said is that the risk is not at all zero, because whether you like it or not, we can look at circumstances, precedent, similar cases, and say things like 'we cannot immediately count out that something almost genetically identical to a human woman will not get this yet, so we should look into it deeper before we say for sure. Its not exactly uncommon for things that happen to women to happen to men. The CDC can raise confidence in a vaccine people are massively skeptical about by making sure they do not kill people because a redditor was not happy enough with their logic"".

Thats like saying breast cancer isnt such huge problem in general because for men the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer is about 1 in 833 and women have 1 in 8 chance. That means in general population risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer is around 1:420. Doesnt sound so horrible like 1:8, does it.

The patents are the reason we got all these for-profit companies to race for the vaccine in the first place. Playing Lucy and the Football is a short-sighted strategy that will screw us when the next pandemic happens.

And the people talking about the ""research"" being publicly funded are totally missing the boat. How about the years of expertise companies like Moderna have acquired with mRNA vaccines? That wasn't ""publicly funded""

I don't want the Government attempting to make vaccines itself for the next pandemic. That sounds like a nightmare scenario.

Put aside your concerns about ""fairness"" for a second, and take a look at the process of trying to create a vaccine for a pandemic disease:

1. The government tries to create the vaccine itself with its own money, and then gives it to the public for free.
2. The government lets private companies make the vaccine and negotiates a price with them that the Government will pay. Given the urgency of the situation, the Government may also choose to subsidize this vaccine development, production and testing in order to get the vaccine out quicker.

3. The government does the same thing as 2, and leaves private companies under the impression that profit will happen, but then expropriates the IP after the vaccine turns out to be useful. Now, no one will ever trust the Government in any future pandemics, and IP rights will be strongly weakened in general, leaving the Government with 1 as the only option.


Given the behavior of the Government so far during this pandemic, (1) is clearly NOT a good option. The Government has consistently underestimated the time it is possible to have a vaccine in, and this would likely be a self-fulfilling prophecy if they decided to try to create a vaccine themselves. Government scientists and ""public health experts"" consistently cast doubt on the mRNA technology and likely would've chosen a different tech if they created the vaccine themselves. Government has been mostly a total disaster when urgency is needed. No thank you.


(2) is clearly a better option than (1), will clearly save more lives and get the economy back up and running, so why do people want to try the disingenuous (3) which will inevitably lead to (1) being the only option in the future.

Of course these companies should make a profit. They should make a much bigger profit lol, the Government should've offered massive prizes to companies who quickly made an effective vaccine. The small price the Government has to pay for vaccines is minuscule compared to the massive economic benefits from a vaccinated population.

Also, if you get the flu shot early in the season, by late season the shot you got could be ineffective and you can still get a severe case.

Instead, it's that covid will develop a variant that gets into the country before a booster can be safely developed and deployed.  Less covid in the world reduces that risk.

I disagree for a few reasons. First, this age demographic tends to be under medical supervision often enough and they will be encouraged one on one by their providers to get vaccinated. 

Second, the numbers indicate that this group is still getting vaccinated at a high rate considering only 20% remain to initiate the process. At the current rate, they'll be at 90% in a month. Of course it will slow down so I'm not saying that it will be a month, just that there is still a lot of momentum. 

Third, obviously this is the highest risk group and the messaging around this has been very clear from the beginning. How big of an asshole would you have to be to suggest to your elderly relatives not to get the vaccine? (By the way, I do know of one such instance, and yes the son they live with is about as giant an asshole as you can imagine. Also they have disinformation that Lupus--the mother--and GBS--the father--means you should not get vaccinated. I told them they should ask their doctor. GBS is a bit dicey but still not a reason to go unvaccinated [as I understand it](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/underlying-conditions.html). Anyway, I have a plan to smuggle the mom out to get vaccinated.)

We know that the mortality rate in the more elderly population for example far exceed the risk of VIPIT and therefore it is still wise to take the AZ vaccine in the population given the rarity of VIPIT. The other factor to keep in mind is that many developing countries do not have the liberty of being able to meet the requirements for the storage of the mRNA based vaccines.

I've mentioned elsewhere that I personally agree to the move several countries are taking in vaccinating the older population (and those living in countries which  are less developed/unable to meet the storage requirements of mRNA based vaccines) with AZ. Furthermore we've seen that  hospitalisations were prevented following one dose of AZ  by 94% so there's no doubt that it's an effective vaccine.

""If my loved one was among the 6 with a complication AND the FDA/CDC/US govt knew there was a signal but didn’t act, I’d be furious.  I really appreciate the transparency here.   They could’ve easily argued this away...” this is the background rate of clots” etc. But they didn’t. Will this mean it’ll be harder to convince many, especially younger women, to get the J&amp;J vaccine if/when we start using it widely again? Yes.  ...even if the risk is shown to be much lower than Covid, getting struck by lightning, or dying from a vending machine crushing you? Yes. But the practical importance of this pause - and how it was messaged, with a focus on informing providers - was huge. And really responsible.  I was in the ER today. One of the first patients I saw after getting briefed on the J&amp;J decision was a young woman in her 30s. She got the J&amp;J vaccine a week ago. She had symptoms that overlap with those we were told to look out for. Today’s announcement changed my differential diagnosis &amp; impacted my clinical management.  That’s exactly what it was meant to do. It’s also how we’ll get the data we need. Look, let’s stop pretending that people don’t know the difference between vaccines. Or that potential issues with one vaccine mean they won’t get the others if they’re available to them.  Will today’s announcement impact vaccine hesitancy? Perhaps. Maybe a bit. At most. But more importantly, it should drastically improve our faith in the public health institutions tasked with protecting us. With how they had been politicized &amp; over-ruled by the previous admin, this is critical.  And that’s exactly why I think today’s decision was the right one.""

However, at this point I think the risk is pretty damn close to zero.

First off, there are MANY health risks that are higher for men than women and vica versa.  Just because it affects one does NOT imply it will affect the other.  The fact that they are genetically near identical is not how biological works.  There are hormonal differences between men and women which create different interactions.  

To go even further, saying because they are genetically similar there is reason to believe they are going to have similar interactions is... silly.  You know old people and young people are genetically nearly identical?  And yet, despite that, old people and young people have very different health risks.  Genetics is one part, environmental and contextual is another massive part of medicine.

The fact that after millions and millions of injections there haven't been any cases of men getting clots implies, at the VERY least, that men are less likely to get it.  The odds of this many women having symptoms and NO men is nearly very unlikely if they have the same risk.  

So yes, I am going to go ahead and take back assertion that there is zero risk.  That was wrong.

However, at this point in time, until SOME cases of men show up with the symptoms, the most scientific statement is near zero risk.

It would be helpful to have numbers to compare positive percentages between vaccinated people and unvaccinated people. Hopefully the vaccinated people are far less lately to test positive.

Over the last 3 months, it really seems like testing has been deemphasized from what some people did for the first 10 months of Covid.

That's super understandable. 

Remember that one hypothesis (which we now, unfortunately, have to consider less likely to be true) is that the problems with the AZ vaccine were related to the non-prefusion-stabilized spike protein in the AZ vaccine, whereas the spike protein produced by the JnJ and mRNA vaccines is prefusion stabilized. 

Meanwhile, the JnJ and AZ vaccines are based on different Adenoviruses. (The AZ vaccine is based on a modified chimpanzee adenovirus; the JnJ uses a human adenovirus. The Sputnik vaccine uses a pair of human adenoviruses ... and if you believe Russia, it doesn't cause clotting issues - although I'm not sure we should believe Russia. Cansino is also an adenovirus-vectored vaccine, and they're claiming no clotting issues, although, again, how much do we trust them?

So while before we were aware of these JnJ incidents, the idea that the adenovirus vector might be the culprit was certainly one of the possibilities (and I wouldn't be surprised if they discovered these clots because they were looking, because of the AZ virus) it wasn't the only one. To say it's a ""similar"" technology is true as far as it goes, but there are actually somewhere around a dozen AD26 (the same as the jnj vax) viral vector vaccines out in the world (albeit they're almost all still in trial stages): for Ebola, Zika, Malaria, RSV, filovirus, and others, without, as far as I know, reports of clotting issues (with the big caveat that the numbers are too low to have confidence that they'd show up). 

So at the the time they gave you the shot, the best they could have said is ""The blood clots with AZ might be caused by a viral vector similar but not identical to the viral vector we're using here, but they also might not be.""",,,1618458432,{},gukhan2,False,t3_mr1ncn,False,False,t1_guk41ym,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mr1ncn/jj_vaccine_to_remain_in_limbo_while_officials/gukhan2/,1618467526,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Firstly - no shame, no embarrassment.  I tried to tough guy through it for far too long, but having a hyperactive vasovagal is not something that I can control.  Be totally up front with your Dr/nurse that you have a history of fainting due to vasovagal issues.  They will appreciate being told, and they will help you as if you faint on site, much more paperwork for them!

For me - I make sure I am lying down when I have it done.  It doesn't hurt at the time at all.  However, because of the vasovagal reaction I know that if I get up I will faint.  So I ask them to slowly lift the bed from flat to sitting over a period of time.  My reactions are very severe, so this can take up to 30-45 minutes.  Do everything really slowly.  Once you are sitting on the edge of the bed, stay there for a few minutes too.  Then have a walk round inside before you leave the building.  

For a long time I used to feel really guilty about taking up so much medical professionals time for something that for 99% of the population is standard and done within a minute.  

I actually got through this injection without fainting (the staff were brilliant), but I fainted the next morning getting out of bed.  I got out of bed quite quickly (needed the toilet!) thought, 'don't feel so good', thought of the injection, and then was gone.  So even the next morning, take your time.

Let's say you socially distance, you quarantine, you do everything right, but then you get ran into by someone is rushing to work and isn't paying attention, also anti-vax and is a carrier. All of a sudden you catch it and you are unvaccinated against it and you die. 


Is the chance of that scenario happening more than 39 in 10 million? I would accept the argument that its very rare to the point of being similar, or indistinguishable. 


But now let's think of the other limitless ways your plan could backfire, unsanitary grocery store, family not getting the memo, people not social distancing in public from you (its not all in your control). Etc etc. Would you still argue that the chance of a clot was worth the potential risk of catching covid?


People are asking you to potentially risk your life to take this vaccine, but that already happens countless times in your every day life. 


At that pedestrian crossing, you trust someone won't be on their phone and run you over. 


In the supermarket you trust the light fitting was installed correctly so it won't fall on you when  you are walking around. 


You trust that the person walking on the other street has complete control of their dog and it won't attack you


The list could go on and on and on but the point is, you risk your life for 39 in 10m every day, multiple times, and I will be blunt and honest, it could turn into the biggest and most regrettable mistake of your life not getting this vaccine, even if you think you are doing everything right.

That humidity comes entirely from folk's breath. This is doubly so in low passenger count flights (the pax count is actually used by the circ system to estimate mix to keep humidity right). 

Now, of course, every time the air recirculates, it reduces the proportion of ""twice recirculated air"" by about half. But plenty of air lives multiple ""generations"" through this cycle.

They certainly don’t seem to have known what they were doing.

Back of the envelope math tells you that the surge in medical demand alone will overwhelm the supply chain. A seconds thought tells you a substantial fraction of the public will call bullshit on the whole “masks do nothing unless professionally fitted” thing.

So all that lie does is slow down universal masking, and make some people more resistant to it.

That doesn’t seem like they knew what they were doing.

Neither does deciding that since we haven’t proven covid is airborne yet, we’re going to assume it isn’t.

Personally, if I was working with a novel virus, I’d assume it had the same characteristics of the others in its family until I got more information. And every other coronavirus is airborne, so that seems like a good starting point. Plus, way better to figure out it isn’t and lower precautions, rather than admit it is months late.

My guess is they thought the words “airborne virus” would cause people to panic, so they refused to admit it. But an early focus on ventilation would have had huge effects. The early decisions alter the trajectory way more than later ones.

Overall, they had a real problem with being unwilling to say anything until they had a study proving it. For example, repeatedly saying “the vaccine does not prevent transmission” instead of saying “the vaccine almost certainly prevents transmission, but we don’t have results back yet”.

So no, as best I can tell they don’t seem to have known what they were doing.

Even now, the CDC seems to be changing its mind constantly on what’s safe for vaccinated people.

&gt;According to the Robert Koch Institute, 14,381,068 vaccinations had been performed by April 2, 2021, including 10,722,876 vaccinations with Comirnaty, 713,067 vaccinations with Moderna, and 2,945,125 vaccinations with Vaxzevria.  
&gt;  
&gt;As of 04/02/2021, 42 cases of central venous/sinus vein thrombosis have been reported following vaccination with Vaxzevria. Thrombocytopenia was also reported in 23 cases. In one case in which central sinus vein thrombosis with cerebral hemorrhage was detected postmortem, the platelet count could not be reliably determined.   
&gt;  
&gt;All but seven of the other cases involved women aged 20 to 63 years. The men were aged 24 to 58 years. Eight patients (5 women, 3 men) died. In individual of the patients who suffered sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopenia after vaccination, high platelet antibodies (PT4) were detected, which together with the clinical picture suggest a clinical picture similar to autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (aHIT)-. In aHIT, thrombosis can occur even without the administration of heparin.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Paul Ehrlich Institute has numerically more case reports of sinus vein thrombosis after vaccination with Vaxzevria in women (83.3% vs. 16.7%), with young women being particularly frequently affected. However, women were also vaccinated more frequently than men, according to the Robert Koch Institute.  
&gt;  
&gt;For women aged 20-59 years, significantly more cases were observed (n=33) than would have been expected based on the background incidence.  
&gt;  
&gt;Seven cases of sinus vein thrombosis were reported after vaccination with Comirnaty. No cases reported thrombocytopenia. Three women aged 34 to 81 years and four men aged 81 to 86 years were affected. The number of reported cases, taking into considering the doses inoculated compared with the expected Number of sinus thromboses not increased.

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

I think this vaccine is statistically a positive force for the overall community, because a few people suffering from side effects is much better for the community than COVID being left alone and affecting many people.

But for a given individual, the risk isn't negligible, and the gain is not extreme. The gain is especially not high if remaining confined and waiting a little until you can get a shot of a safer vaccine is an option.

My parents go their first shots of AstraZeneca. My mom had a bad day, like many people, but recovered perfectly on the next day. My dad had his shot while recovering from bad bruises on the thighs. The bruises tripled in volume, got extremely painful for about a week before they started to go back to normal. He was crippled during this period of time, and my parents were scared as hell. I know this is anecdotal evidence, but yeah the first person I know that took the vaccine got really bad side effects, so it's hard not to be biased.

My advice: take AstraZeneca if you:
- Can't get another vaccine soon,
- Is in perfectly good health with no bruises, recent surgery, or other factor that increases the risk of side effects.

Otherwise just wait, wear your mask, stay home and be careful, and take a safer vaccine when you get the chance.

How is summer 2021 looking?

Asked about what he sees the summer season looking like for Market Square Day and other large scale events, Sununu said, “I really mean it, plan big, plan big.”

He asked businesses and citizens to think how things will be two months from now.

“Everyone who wants a vaccine is going to be absolutely fully vaccinated … everyone who wants a vaccine can get in the system now,” Sununu said. “Our case numbers are going to be up, I think, through April and even early May, but the fatality rate is down.”

He predicted COVID case numbers will “come down drastically in May” and by June there will be “very low case numbers, very low fatalities, a fully vaccinated population … with a lot of cash in people’s pockets.”

“They all want a vacation, they want that vacation they didn’t get in 2020 and the word is out New Hampshire’s the place to be,” he said.

He also encouraged communities to “plan big if you’re planning parades or festivals, don’t think about like it’s April 14, think about it like it’s July 4th.”",,,1618498449,{},gulzun6,False,t3_mrblya,False,True,t3_mrblya,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mrblya/new_hampshire_to_lift_covid_restrictions/gulzun6/,1618499417,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

So it definitely can be scary hearing about all of these things in the news -- I think it's important to note that 1) these more serious side effects are *literally* one in a million and 2) there is no evidence that the mRNA vaccines have similar side effects either.

The infertility stuff was started by a conspiracy theorist who, simply, has lost touch with reality. Here's his explanation: he believes that the spike protein is similar to a placental protein, so therefore, he thinks that the vaccines will cause autoimmune attack of placenta.

That is just wrong on so many levels. First, if that was the case, we would see the same phenomenon with actual COVID-19 infection, which we clearly don't. Second, the *proteins are not similar at all* -- they have an 11% similarity. For context, we say that two proteins are *barely* similar to each other at all when they hit like 20-25% similarity. 11% is comically low; if the body attacked anything with 11% similarity to something it had an immune response against, the immune system would have wiped us all out long ago. It's total nonsense, but unfortunately, this person has been spreading this misinformation, hence the rumors floating around about this.

Finally, on the topic of long run side effects -- just based on the underlying biology, that really shouldn't be a concern. I actually did a similar writeup on this point in our FAQ a while ago that I recommend you read: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq#wiki_how_is_it_possible_to_create_a_safe_vaccine_in_such_a_short_period_of_time.3F) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq#wiki_why_are_existing_vaccine_testing_paradigms_useful_for_testing_safety_of_mrna_vaccines.3F). I go a lot more in depth there, but just to briefly summarize: the actual vaccine component is going to be destroyed pretty quickly, so if there's any other issues, it's going to be because of the immune response. But those sorts of autoimmune conditions will show up very quickly -- like 2-6 weeks at most, and at this point, we can comfortably say that they are not any sort of significant or vaccine-attributable risk. Immune responses don't just randomly flare up years later, and even if they did, it's the same immune response you'd have now, so it's not as if something brand new is going to appear months or years after the fact.

However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

I’ve seen that paper you posted before,  but I’ve since seen a few other (though not many, as I said) more recent things that suggest that moderna does indeed elicit cd8+.

It studies the response of cd8+ (and cd4+) t-cells elicited by both Pfizer and moderna, which means that there were moderna-elicited ones to study. I’ve also been told that t-cells are often tough to measure which could help explain why early on Pfizer found them but moderna didn’t...they maybe weren’t looking as hard or were using a less-than-ideal test or some of both.


I know this response makes it sound like I already knew the answer or was fishing for one that agrees with what I already think, and that may be true to some degree, but I’m more looking for additional info on this and to “confirm” these notions.

The fact that masks went away doesn’t mean that it’s working if you look at the #s

There have been places the entire last year where they weren’t required, I know that there’s plenty of people like you and even in this sub apparently but they’re not going away because there is a huge overlap of anti-maskers who are anti-vaxxers &amp; will cause the need to continue to wear masks in planes, public transport, and shared spaces like stores and stadiums.


There are plenty of places that did away with the mandate in multiple states, and they’re dangerous policies jumping the gun and making an environment to continue to allow the virus to develop variants (bc thats what viruses do) that could potentially bypass the vaccines’ efficacy. 


People wouldnt wear a mask and made it so much worse than it needed to be

The short answer is: there has been, there have just been issues that have prevented the mRNA from getting into the cell before the immune system degrades it. STAT News did a great piece on this topic [here](https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race/).

Basically, there are a couple problems that had to be solved. First, there needed to be a way to prevent the mRNA from getting caught too quickly and degraded rapidly by the immune system before it even has a chance to get into the cells. This is independent of the RNAses I described above -- I'm talking about an actual immune response here. Second, there needed to be a way to efficiently get it into the cells. Third, you have to show that combining the previous two steps actually is effective in causing protein production in cells and gets degraded on a reasonable timescale in the cell.

These developments essentially were published in 2004, 2000, and 2010, respectively -- the biggest problem being the first one, of preventing the immune system from attacking the mRNA itself. The STAT News piece does a really good job going into the details here in an accessible way.

So the short answer is: we've known about mRNA for a long time, but actually harnessing it is based on more recent tweaks.

As for understanding the molecular biology, it really depends how in depth you want to get. If you want a good understanding of it at a pretty reasonably accessible level, I'd suggest reading from Albert's Molecular Biology of the Cell on [making RNA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26887/) and [using RNA to make proteins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26829/), an old edition of which is actually available for free. This reading is actually what we assign to first-year undergrads in an introductory molecular biology course that I TA, and it's typically pretty well-received. If you want a simpler explanation, I can see if I can scrounge something up, but I highly recommend trying out the Albert's section first.

(For readability in the above link, I recommend clicking ""Disable Glossary Links,"" but it could also be helpful to you based on your background.)

A few reasons: that’s what was tested, so it’s safer/easier to do that. One shot for everyone first, then the second is likely a better strategy, but doing that is sticking your neck, so if you’re wrong you’re liable. What’s safest politically/career wise isn’t always what’s best.

&gt;People have become so anti anti-vaccers on this site that they've gone to the opposite extreme and become pro-vaccine zealots that ignore any expert advice or testimony to the contrary. I fear for many it is more about being superior to anti-vaccers than scientific truth.

1. The fact a vaccine was discovered to have side effects doesn't mean anti-vaxxers are right or smart. It means they're absolute idiots because it proves that ""mainstream science"" (aka science) *does* care about vaccine side effects, *does* inform the public of vaccine risks, *does* adjust policy to protect citizens and not just medical companies, that the ""mainstream media"" *does* report on the objective truth of vaccines, and that rational people *are* listening to the experts. The fact this is happening actually proves how stupid anti-vaxxers are. It basically blows apart their entire ""beliefs"" about dangerous vaccines and conspiracies. The fact scientists have said for decades that vaccines are safe isn't because there's a secret conspiracy to lie about vaccines - it's because the vaccines *are* actually safe and if/when an issue with a vaccine is discovered it's not kept a secret. 

2. Pro-vaccine (aka rational) people *are* superior to anti-vaxxers, at least on this topic, because they're making a decision based on science instead of memes and feelings, and that's a superior choice. Anti-vaxxers aren't super-informed truth-tellers crusading for health and safety... they're just deluded and cringeworthy. 

3. It's anti-vaxxers who don't listen to expert advice or testimony. Literally every health organization in the world can recommend something, and anti-vaxxers will ignore it because of their implicit science denial and then see a Facebook video from one lone  Dr Whoeverthefuck saying he feels he ""has to come forward and tell the secret truth"" and then they'll pat themselves on the back for ""listening to the experts"". This is called confirmation bias, and everyone with any sense knows that's not how a rational person becomes informed.

Also, the trials had all sorts of problems since they didn't have many serious cases in the placebo control groups.  SO their efficacy rates can be very inaccurate:

https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson-vaccines-compared/618226/

&gt;The two vaccine trials that did explicitly report hospitalizations as an efficacy outcome make this latter issue very clear. For the AstraZeneca vaccine, one person in the control group had severe COVID-19, but eight people were hospitalized; for Johnson &amp; Johnson, 34 people in the placebo group had severe COVID-19, but only five people were hospitalized. It’s true that zero vaccinated people were hospitalized in either study after the vaccines took effect. But with numbers that small, you can’t draw a reliable conclusion about how high efficacy may be for these outcomes.

&gt;As Diana Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research pointed out about the Johnson &amp; Johnson trial, “It’s misleading to tell the public that nobody who was vaccinated was hospitalized unless you also tell them that only 5 people in the placebo group were hospitalized.” She’s right. And you can’t be confident about predicting effectiveness precisely in a wider population outside the trial, either. For example, some of the vaccine trials included relatively few people older than 60 as participants.

&gt;You can see how fragile these numbers are by looking at those compiled for severe disease. **In the Pfizer trial, for example, just one vaccinated person developed severe COVID-19 versus three in the placebo group—which meant that a single bout of disease made the difference between a calculated efficacy rate of 66 percent and one of 100 percent.**

&gt;For the Novavax and Oxford-AstraZeneca trials, there were zero people with severe disease in the vaccinated group versus only one in the control group, so adding or subtracting one would have been even more dramatic. **The problem is even greater for deaths. For that efficacy analysis, only two of the vaccine trials—for Moderna’s and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s—reported any COVID-19 deaths at all in the control groups.**",,,1618516660,{},gun5txd,False,t3_mrcrm8,False,True,t1_gun1uvw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mrcrm8/covid_eight_times_more_likely_to_cause_rare_brain/gun5txd/,1618523842,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The way I look at it, it's a balance between risk and reward.  I love eating out, but not so much that I'm willing to go take my mask off in an indoor situation with only about 20% of the population being vaccinated.

I'm willing to do limited activities for another 6 months.  Some people do not have that luxury.  They have to go to work or put their kids in school.  I don't have to eat in a restaurant or go to a gym.  Why wold I add to risk of others for a small reward for myself?

I also look at places like Michigan.  The legislature took the governor's powers to lock down away.  Case numbers have been soaring ever since.  When you can see real-world examples of what happens when you open too soon, it's not hard to decide to be cautious.

Might there be a time when we know we'll never have a handle on this virus and we can either live our lives or not?  Sure, there might.  But I would expect that to lead to prudent people finding a way to stay safer while going on with their lives.  It may mean developing better masks that you can wear all the time.  It might mean engineering better indoor air filtration systems.

I've seen first hand what Covid can mean to someone.  My cousin got a mild case back in March, 2020.  She still has trouble with her sense of smell and there are a lot of foods that taste wrong to her.  Many taste or smell like vomit or gasoline.  She's been living with that for a full year.  I don't think she's worried about whether she'll ever eat out again given that she lives mostly on plain pasta and potatoes.  She's financially well off and has access to the best medical care and they can't help her.

I'm more than willing to continue to take precautions rather than risk living the rest of my life like that.

Based on your current numbers, it feels ***extremely*** likely that the United States will have near herd immunity before July.

We know the virus spreads very quickly among kids, and the CDC estimates that there are about four undetected infections for every positive test.

Those are still really good numbers, but why put yourself in high risk situations when you don't have to?

As I said in my original comment, there is no data on whether those who get it after being vaccinated will have long Covid or organ damage like those who were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms.

They also still don't know if you can transmit Covid to others if you get it after being vaccinated.

The article then fails to provide the data, to allow for independent verification, or allow for discussion.

The maddening thing in all of this is the (undemocratic) mandates coming down from unnamed experts using unverifiable data.

Transparency is always key. I love science. I love science's independent verifiability. When I'm blocked from doing that I immediately become skeptical as anyone else should. 

From the CDC they found the second derivative (daily growth rates of deaths) was reduced almost 2% after 100 days.

&gt; Mask mandates were associated with a 0.7 percentage point decrease (p = 0.03) in daily COVID-19 death growth rates 1–20 days after implementation and decreases of 1.0, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.9 percentage points 21–40, 41–60, 61–80, and 81–100 days, respectively, after implementation (p&lt;0.01 for all). Daily case and death growth rates before implementation of mask mandates were not statistically different from the reference period.

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm

&gt; Yet the same people that are voicing this opinion likely ridiculed the  very same kind of thinking in relation to anti-lockdown rhetoric; that  the positive of keeping the economy going outweighs all the lives that  will be lost. 

There is a massive difference between tens of thousands of lives lost per country on average (and multiple hundreds of thousands for the bigger ones like the US) due to COVID, and the single or double-digit number of people affected by the extremely rare side-effects of the AZ and J&amp;J vaccine, of whom the affected rate does not even necessarily correlate to an amount of deaths, as I believe some of the people who were affected by the J&amp;J vaccine did survive the ordeal.

I understand what you're getting at but it's a bit disingenuous to lump all these people in the same category when there is such an obvious difference in the statistics present.

And I get it; if your opinion is that any life lost is one too many, then for sure we cannot go around risking people's lives with the very vaccine that's meant to save them.

Then again, how many people would have died of covid vs. the amount of people that would have died of the vaccine, should we delay or cancel it? Those are the type of estimates that are hard to make. Those are the decisions that are even harder to make; because whose lives are going to be sacrificed regardless? 

Someone who could have gotten a vaccine this week, or next week, but couldn't? Or someone who will get the vaccine and die due to it? Both are terrible of course.

My best guess is that the last sentence makes your comment sound negative towards, at least, AZ vaccine. For people that skim comments and basically read only the first or last sentence, you can see how that could be misinterpreted.

I personally disagree with the amount of negative coverage for AZ, and am interested in the latest J&amp;J developments, since both of those are being paused out of an ""*abundance of caution*"".

IMHO, they are way less dangerous than an average person percieves them to be, and my guess is that more people *might* die because of not vaccinating (because of fears/bad press/etc) than would if everyone in the world were to be vaccinated using AZ exclusively.

1. What is the harm/benefit trade-off for the AZ vaccine across particular groups of the population? 
2. Should an individual who has had the AZ vaccine be worried?

The first brings into play the risk of serious harm from covid vs the risk of harm from the vaccine when viewed in the aggregate across millions of people. In a number of countries it has been concluded that this analysis means there are different alternatives which may be better suited for these groups.

On the other hand, the second question is about the absolute risk of an individual to suffer serious harm from the vaccine, eg one of these blood clots. In this case, you may want to compare this risk to other potentially fatal risks that you experience (and probably ignore) in everyday life to give perspective on the chance of this happening to you.

Both of these are valid analysis, and they are not at all mutually exclusive: a person under 30 (or wherever you want to draw the line) might be better off getting a different jab, but at the same, they probably shouldn't be overly anxious about developing this rare type of blood clot if they get a dose of AZ.",,,1618494843,{},guls10r,False,t3_mrcrm8,False,True,t1_gulm6e2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mrcrm8/covid_eight_times_more_likely_to_cause_rare_brain/guls10r/,1618495016,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

So with that advice I still strongly recommend higher risk people get the mrna vaccine. 

We also do not know if the risk of getting covid on top of the risk of covid clots is higher than the vaccine. The risk of covid alone while social distancing is low  then the risk of covid clot is low. The risk of vaccine clot is very low for a general population but unknown for higher risk clotting groups. 

Clotting from covid was much more likely in a hospitalized patient. If i get mild covid, even with my risks, what is then my risk most likely lower. 

The big issue is the type of clots. The vaccine is specifically causing a clotting disorder causing cerebral clots (especially bad for my brain aneurysm) where as covid is causing peripheral clots that can break off and cause pulmonary embolism or stroke but the vaccine specific clot personally I would be more fearful of. 

I believe everyone should be aware of the risks and make the decision that puts them in the lowest rosk of harm possible.

Quote from the researchers:

&gt; Laboratory test results, available in a subset of the COVID-19 patients, provide preliminary evidence suggestive of raised D-dimer, lowered fibrinogen, and an increased rate of thrombocytopenia (low platelets) in the CVT and PVT groups.

These data show that the incidence of CVT is significantly increased after COVID-19, and greater than that observed with BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines. 

&gt; The risk of CVT following COVID-19 is also higher than the latest estimate from the European Medicines Agency for the incidence associated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (5.0 per million people, 95% CI 4.3–5.8).

The infection fatality rate in your two groups is indeed the same. That's not nonsense; it's an important result.

If they don't do that, it's important to know. 

A better criticism of my post is that the infection fatality rate depends on age. It's much higher in people who are over 80. We don't know the age breakdown of the vaccinated group, although the article does say that only 40% of the infections are over 60.

Yes, there’s a “chance”. But it’s about as good as your odds of winning the lottery; maybe even less (depending which one you play).

Oh no, that’s not how anything works. If wealthier countries make J&amp;J and AZ for export only, nobody is ever forgetting the blood clotting and getting away with saying “I thought they’d be grateful.”

Put yourself in the shoes of someone from the developing world 10 years from now about how there were different vaccines for rich countries and poor countries because of a side effect that most in the developing world have extreme difficulty in treating 

You may then have westerners continuing to say “they should be grateful” stirring resentment

The only possible moral solutions here are:

1.	Identify at-risk groups for adenovirus-vector vaccines and be certain they’re given alternative vaccines while not barring it to most people. (Do *not* say “at this age group, the risk of COVID outweighs the risk of side effects. That is still an argument for giving them other vaccines so if that’s the case, give them the other vaccines.) This may require a ramp-up of mRNA vaccine tech and bringing freezers to the developing world and not using infrastructure as an excuse

The USA has a wide scale vaccination program to foster herd immunity for MMR (measles, mumps, rubella). And of course the seasonal flu, although that's not as close a comparison because the flu is so mutative.

AZ isn’t in charge of public health institutions’ policy decisions and vaccine rollout plans. These institutions are gathering their own independent statistics on vaccinated people through various reporting systems and doing their own risk assessments. Of course AZ has an incentive to make the vaccine seem safe, but they don’t have some stranglehold on public policy across dozens of countries around the world, and there is zero evidence that they have downplayed the risk of their vaccine. 

The phase III trials were done in conjunction with independent public health institutions, so it’s extremely unlikely that AZ would be able to falsify data without the FDA/CDC knowing. The risk of this complication is also on the order of 1/100,000-1/1,000,000 and the phase III trial had less than 40k participants so it’s unlikely an effect this rare would show up in their trials, but event reporting after millions of doses would pick it up. Just because AZ didn’t report this side effect doesn’t mean they’re maliciously downplaying risks for profit. It’s rare enough that they couldn’t have statistically detected it at all. 

Public health institutions around the world have gathered the data, assessed the risk, and suspended its use in vulnerable age groups out of caution. This is the system working exactly as it should.

Indeed, platelets play a central role in Covid pathophysiology and aspirin is a potent ""anti-platelet"".

It is a monumental tragedy that he and others like him were drowned out by the fools and frauds rife in government and medicine. BTW, it's all the there in twitter, with timestamps. He was desperately preaching anticoagulation around April, now standard care for severe Covid. If the man had been sitting in a place of influence like a Fauci or Birx, 100's of thousands would still be alive.

The most important thing about Covid, ultimately responsible for so many deaths, is that it is a disease that requires EARLY INTERVENTION. Once the damage is done in the first 12 days or so, the outcome is a crap shoot. Early intervention with any combination of viral entry inhibitors (including the much maligned HCQ), aspirin, ivermectin, and fluvoxamine would have saved so many lives.

The directive came after receiving the position of the professionals in the ministry according to which in view of the low morbidity there is no longer a need for masks in open space. It should be emphasized: in a closed area, the obligation to wear a mask will still apply. As stated, the directive will take effect starting this coming Sunday, 18.4.21.

Later on the manager of Atalanta said he decided to coach the game rather than going to a hospital, despite having COVID symptoms, because he was scared of the number of COVID patients that were already at Bergamo hospital (he later tested positive for COVID). On Valencia's side they said over a third of the team's coaching staff + players also tested positive.

As for more recently, there have been some pretty big outbreaks that caused matches to get postponed in the EPL (the league I follow, I'm sure others as well) - for example Newcastle reportedly had 19 positive cases in a week during December, which forced them to postpone at least one match (and IIRC one of their best players, Allan Saint-Maximin, struggled with after symptoms for weeks). Man City had some players out on both the men's and women's teams and also had to postpone a match.

And if you expand to other sports - I follow figure skating where a lot of the top contenders (particularly in women's figure skating) are from Russia, and there have been a lot of cases in the Russian figure skating community in particular, including a skater named Alena Kostornaia, who was the reigning European Champion (which considering Russia's dominance means she is automatically one of the favorites to win Worlds / Olympics) - she was out for many weeks with a serious case of COVID, and ran out of time to get back into competitive shape to qualify for Worlds, despite being only 16 years old which doesn't put her in the risk group for COVID at all. Luckily the winter olympics aren't until next year, but I would say this is an example that trying to hold the Olympics in the middle of a pandemic has a negative impact on the competitive integrity of the games as well, especially in sports like figure skating where a lot of top contenders might only have 1 shot in their entire career to qualify and compete.",,,1618507999,{},gumlvag,False,t3_mqjmli,False,True,t1_guk67nf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mqjmli/with_100_days_until_the_olympics_japan_has/gumlvag/,1618512275,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

And in a [national study](https://www.westhealth.org/resource/vaxmap-potential-covid-19-vaccine-locations/)  conducted in conjunction with the University of Pittsburgh School of  Pharmacy, Dickson found that Black Americans in nearly two dozen urban  counties in and around Atlanta, New Orleans and Dallas, among a host of  other cities, faced [longer driving distances to vaccine centers](https://www.westhealth.org/resource/vaxmap-potential-covid-19-vaccine-locations/) than white Americans.

Also not mentioned, what EXACTLY are they planning to do for vaccination in the 3rd world?  I hear talk that it might be 3-5 YEARS before they can get things taken care of maybe..  I heard some TV news chick carrying on about getting 20-30 tubes of vaccines into a village of a few THOUSAND people.  So, 100-150 people get to live, and the rest, up shit creek right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Still, I get it, first world has to save its ass first to try and save everyone else. But if certain ""undesirable elements"" get wiped out in the plague, all good right?  Nudge things here and there, massage the numbers, do a few big PR things about vaccinating a few remote villages, and promptly drop the ball following through.

*pp are* [*percentage points*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point)*, the arithmetic difference between today's percentage and a prior date.  For example, if a group was 50.0% today and 45.0% before, this is a 5.0 pp difference.*

Notes:

* Data from [CDC vaccination demographic trends page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends) and exact totals for every age group can be downloaded as a CSV.  The site provides a graph of this data over time.  While the graph title says it is by ""Date Administered"", the data more closely represents doses by ""Date Reported"".
* Changes are calculated on unrounded numbers and may differ from rounded percentages.
* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC source due to lack of age-related vaccination data, so data does not match national totals.
* The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group. The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, and assumes that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17 since no vaccines are currently approved for use under age 16.
* 16+ and 0+ age groups include doses administered to those of unknown ages. This is usually less than 0.02% of the total doses administered.

*pp are* [*percentage points*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point)*, the arithmetic difference between today's percentage and a prior date.  For example, if a group was 50.0% today and 45.0% before, this is a 5.0 pp difference.*

Notes:

* Data from [CDC vaccination demographic trends page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends) and exact totals for every age group can be downloaded as a CSV.  The site provides a graph of this data over time.  While the graph title says it is by ""Date Administered"", the data more closely represents doses by ""Date Reported"".
* Changes are calculated on unrounded numbers may differ from rounded percentages.
* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC source due to lack of age-related vaccination data, so data does not match national totals.
* The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group. The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, and assumes that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17 since no vaccines are currently approved for use under age 16.
* 16+ and 0+ age groups include doses administered to those of unknown ages. This is usually less than 0.02% of the total doses administered.

That being, we don’t generally care about the significance of risk when going to the bathroom, because it’s such an ordinary thing with such an inherent safety to it, and yet at least a few people die of defecation syncope each year. Extraordinarily rare, and interesting to people who study precisely that one thing, but makes up less than a fraction of a percentage of cases in less than a percentage of the population in less than a percentage of all bathroom visits in a given calendar year.

Sorry, maybe I’m using the wrong terminology; my point was merely that “getting a blood clot due to a vaccine” is so far down the list of OTHER things that can give you blood clots that it may as well not even make an appearance. Clots occur in about 1 in 1000 people per year, vaccinated or not, so attributing this one particular clot to the vaccine is tenuous, at best (in my estimation).It’s like saying that TECHNICALLY, at any time, there is a non-zero risk that a crab could gain intelligence, learn to wield a knife and take you hostage, but the likelihood isn’t even worth bearing consideration in the grand scheme of things. I’m honestly not even sure if these clots can be directly correlated with the vaccine, yet, given the low rate of incidence and the myriad other factors that could be causing it; I wonder if we’re just looking for it because it’s a possibility.

In a systematic review of published studies on transmission of the novel coronavirus and other respiratory viruses, Razani and colleagues found that **less than 10 percent of cases described were spread outdoors.** But they also found frustratingly few papers that detailed the settings or clearly compared indoor and outdoor situations.

“Our takeaway from this is that it’s not impossible to get an infection outdoors, even though from what is published, clearly the proportion of when that happens is much lower,” Razani said.

People not wearing masks are not just the vaccinated people— we all saw the social experiments before last month with states doing away with national mask mandates &amp; opening up stadiums &amp; consequently having surge of young adults hospitalized from b17 :c 

It would be great if the vaccines and masks went hand-in-hand, but the vaccinations are not reaching levels of herd immunity since the anti-maskers overlap a lot as anti-vaxxers; plus we don’t know how long the vaccine will last without a booster/the potential variants that could still come about cuz virus’ are living things that evolve

People that are concerned about the virus &amp; listen to the guidelines from scientists instead of business or politicians are still wearing masks out &amp; about; it’s great the CDC said it’s safe to not wear masks inside even with fully vaccinated people so you should absolutely allow yourself that comfort with close ones!

Utah had one based on vaccine availability that might even have been met already, and Colorado is allowing county-by-county based on running totals of the total weekly caseload.

The problem, as you mentioned, is with the ""it's just not safe *yet*"" approach. When it lacks other details it's basically just licking your finger and sticking it in the wind. And since we all know this virus is going to become endemic, there will always be a way to contrive some way why it's still ""not safe"" yet.

My personal point to watch for is if we start seeing U.S. nationwide daily average new caseload under 20,000, deaths under 200, and vaccinations over 60%. That's the point beyond which we're potentially edging into post-pandemic mask mandates and it becomes justifiable IMO to start ignoring them in certain settings.

Airborne transmission (infection via smaller particles that remain suspended in the air) is relatively rare. Whether or not it's a viable source of infection depends on the circumstance—so enclosed spaces with high concentrations of virus and poor ventilation. 

A sealed room where an infected person does rigorous exercise for an hour could remain a significant risk of exposure for hours after that person left whereas a room with open windows where an infected person sits quietly for fifteen minutes would be low risk almost immediately after they've left.

Europe has Astra Zenica (which has been used to great success by the UK, with less than 0.001% having issues) so stopping it is just ludicrous.

India is producing vaccines amazingly fast, they just have 1.3 billion people so no amount of vaccines is going to stop the surge they are going through.  


Africa and other 3rd world nations (like Brazil for instance) have no vaccine program to make their own, and no facilities to do so should they acquire the design.

I guess I'm just confused about what the next steps are going to be and what the endgame is.

1) At what point in % of the eligible population vaccinated are we going to open back up and end mask mandates? We'll never reach 100% vaccination because of stupidity or religious exemption or health reasons or whatever. I thought from the beginning they were saying this is a virus we'll have to live with forever like the flu. I didn't think the goal was ever to try and irradicate it completely. Since the beginning, it was always ""slow the spread"", ""don't overwhelm the hospitals"", ""protect the vulnerable"". All of those have been done. 

2) Correct me if I'm wrong but all we know about the vaccines is that they are very good protection from getting deathly ill. They don't keep you from contracting it or spreading it, right? If that's the case, why are ""vaccine passes"" a thing? I've heard a lot of statements that by June or July we'll have so many people vaccinated here in the US that we can have sporting events, concerts, etc... again but if they can still spread it around that doesn't make sense. Also, if they don't prevent you from contracting and spreading then why does anyone who's not high-risk NEED to get it?

AZ is a separate chain from other companies, it is an extra amount that does not diminish overall production. If Pfitzer JJ or others could produce more  they would. These are separate companies that will not share their technology and process with others. 


AZ also doesn't require as low temperature for storage, making it a great supplement for less affluent countries - mine is using Pfitzer, Modena and AZ. AZ is available always, the other two have spotty availability and not as much can be stored and not all places can afford appropriate storage at all, so AZ for us makes sure the vaccinations are rolled out without pauses and with wider coverage.
