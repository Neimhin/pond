The best I found was from an LA Times article [1] way back in March of last year.  It's actually remarkable how well some people like Jose-Luis Jimenez and Linsey Marr had it nailed over a year ago and told the story to the press, and here we are in 2021 and aerosol is still controversial...

Anyhow the best description I've found of the space is this:  ""Cushioned metal chairs extended in six rows of 20, with about a foot between chairs and one aisle down the center. There were twice as many seats as people.""  I haven't seen a report of where the index case was, but by my reckoning, that would make the dimensions of the area about 18'x50'.

Now, in many ways, this is a almost a perfect worst case scenario for aerosols.  You had people singing nearly continuously.  In normal social interaction, people take turns talking, so maybe each person is talking maybe 1/4 of the time, and in this case they were singing which is way more airflow through their lungs and higher velocity.  Add to that the couple of hour duration and the fact that supposedly there was no ventilation at all.

That said, it does seem very likely that there was transmission beyond 20 feet.  Still, my objection to the original article stands that to say that there is no difference between 6 feet and 60 feet is not reasonable.  In the totality of the evidence, it does matter how far you are away, and 60 feet is a lot safer than 6 feet, and 6 feet is probably a lot safer than 2 feet.

The trouble with risk communication is that there usually are not any magic numbers, and things depend on circumstances, but it is very hard to communicate all of these subtle things especially when the science is not fully certain.

Both these claims are wrong, many parts of India went back close to normal over winter as cases were low, and parties etc took place. And now we have this horrid phase while a number of western countries are inching back to normalcy.

So then the question becomes: how good is the vaccine at preventing the spread of the virus. And it is effective, but not highly effective. People still get sick and can still spread SARS-cov-2 after being vaccinated.

Would vaccination of the elderly and fragile actually be sufficient in the long term, given that mutations do exist? Here there is very little data yet, but it seems (and many epidemiologists agree) that the vaccin protects us from all variants (due to small genetic variation possibility at the spike protein).

Then you mention patients. The hospital talks about all staff, including administrative. It can be argued that people working directly with fragile patients need to protect themselves, but that argument cannot be made for accounting.

Finally, if patient safety is leading over personal liberties, we should extend this to other measures:

* period psychiatric reports of all employees
* forced sleep regimes
* blood checks on stimulants
* wearing FFP2 masks at all times
* and more...

All of these have a marked impact on the health of the patients.",,,1619221853,{},gvmkker,False,t3_mwwbh4,False,True,t1_gvmcahp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mwwbh4/houston_methodist_says_it_will_fire_workers_who/gvmkker/,1619238945,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Since during the lockdown, all forms of public transport like trains were restricted, these migrant labourers had to make the journey to their village through cycling or walking. 

Some of them could reach their villages, but some have actually died under the sun while walking thousands of kilometers. Many of these people have been left unmarked and I doubt most of these people even got a proper funeral or their families even got notified of their deaths.

This week, the chief minister of Delhi imposed a 7 day lockdown in the city due to the rise of cases. While addressing this, he literally pleaded these migrant workers to not leave Delhi and tried to reassure them that the lockdown will only be up for seven days. Still, there were people who started to leave Delhi.

Imposing a lockdown is good and everything, the maximum the middle class/upper class people might suffer is a pay cut/dent in their revenue. That isn't really the case for lower middle class/poor people who are probably working as contract labourers, hawking vegetables, etc. They will be affected the most. And unlike say, the US or Australia, most people just don't magically get over a thousand dollars a month provided by the government(and I don't think our government can afford to do so anyways).

Usually, the data is straight-up outdated, but more importantly, it never seems to take into account the vastly different (relatively) rates for individual colleges, the differences between Regular Decision applicants vs Early Decision (ED applicants for elite schools can see a percentage boost as high as mid-teens to possibly low 20s), and obviously, the different ""standards"" applicants are subject to in the ""holistic"" approach of elite college admissions. 

For example, a Regular Decision Asian Male applying to Arts and Sciences is statistically subject to an acceptance rate in the single digits. Meanwhile, an Early Decision ""insert underrepresented race"" Female applying to Engineering has a significant statistical boost in admissions. Average the two acceptance percentages and you get your standard ""admission rate"".

But getting millions of people vaccinated one year after the start of the pandemic is still much faster than anybody anticipated.

I am sorry some people have to wait for their appointments, but for example my father got his vaccine 3 days after his age bracket became elligible for vaccinations. 

Please wait for a few more weeks. Things will get better soon.

Among patients who were ill enough to be hospitalized with COVID-19 and who survived beyond the first 30 days of illness, there were 29 excess deaths per 1,000 patients over the following six months.

Longer wait between doses.

All of this while battling the anxiety that severe side effects can hit. Which statistically are more likely than having a bad outcome of covid.

Which btw, is a _possibility_ of contracting_, while this is a certainty, since I did get jabbed.

If you read carefully its actually 2 cases/100000 in that age group, thus more towards 1/50000.

We need much better messaging. Catching COVID while young does not mean you are going to be fine.

There are enough longer term side effects that this should be a major concern among younger people. We do not yet have the research to suggest you can get over it and be okay long term.

In fact, the research so far, anyway, suggests the opposite. Not in most cases, perhaps, but so much is still unknown. And what we know, or think we know, regarding lung and heart issues is not something I would risk at that age.

astrazeneca is possibly the the cheapest of all the vaccines to produce and I suspect because the j&amp;j vaccine is similar, it's probably cheaper to produce compared to the mrna vaccine. the astrazeneca vaccine also was pulled in european countries for blood clot issues.

imo females taking birth control and pregnant females should avoid these 2 vaccines just to be on the safe side as these 2 groups are more prone to blood clots. 

but imo, the problems associated with these vaccines seems to have been overblown and may have political and business motives behind them.

Matthew Miller, an associate professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont., says the main issue with the treatment is that it is difficult to deliver.

Since it is given via intravenous, experts say Bamlanivimab has to be administered in a hospital setting within 10 days of developing symptoms. If a patient is too sick, the treatment cannot be administered.

‚ÄúUnlike a pill, which can easily be brought home and taken by patients in their house, these antibodies have to be delivered by intravenous infusions which can take quite a bit of time and have to be delivered in specialized settings under medical supervision,‚Äù Miller said in an interview with CTV National News.

‚ÄúSo that presents a real logistical challenge to administering these drugs, especially to patients who are not yet very ill yet and wouldn‚Äôt need to be hospitalized,‚Äù he added.

Kumar said the antibody therapy needs to be given ‚Äúas early as possible in the course of the disease.‚Äù However, this can be challenging for those who may be too sick to get themselves to a facility in time.

‚ÄúThis means that if you have COVID, you need to get yourself to an emergency room or an infusion centre, where you can receive this monoclonal, and that‚Äôs been very difficult to do,‚Äù Kumar said.

In the U.S., some places are also grappling with the logistics of using these drugs to help keep COVID-19 patients out of the hospital, while places like Johns Hopkins Medicine have set up outpatient monoclonal antibody therapy infusion centres to help deal with the treatment challenges.

Antibody drugs are also harder to make, Sidhu said, and at more than $1,500 a dose, bamlanivimab is not the cheapest medication. Still, experts have said it is less than the cost of hospitalization or being put in intensive care.

‚ÄúThe people it will help the most are those that have the littlest self-capacity to make antibodies,‚Äù said Sidhu.

IMPACT ON CANADIANS

Eighty-year-old John Tavel contracted the coronavirus in Ottawa last December. He told CTV National News that as his symptoms progressed, his greatest fear was dying from the disease.

‚ÄúMy fever was up to about 103, 103 and a half and ‚Ä¶ I was feeling horrible. So, my wife called an ambulance, and the ambulance took me right off to the hospital,‚Äù Tavel explained.

At the hospital, Tavel asked to be treated with Bamlanivimab. But doctors said they couldn‚Äôt administer it.

Tavel said the doctor told him that they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have a protocol‚Äù for the drug. Instead, he was discharged and told to take Tylenol to help get his fever down.

Tavel‚Äôs daughter, Robyn, who lives in Glencoe, Illinois, says the family heard about using monoclonal antibodies to help treat COVID-19 through their local news after then-U.S. President Donald Trump was given an antibody cocktail for the virus.

‚ÄúAs soon as we knew that that was available in Canada‚Ä¶ We immediately knew that my father had to have it,‚Äù Robyn said. ‚ÄúThe window of opportunity to administer this was just 10 days after someone had become very sick, and had been diagnosed, and so we had to get action.‚Äù

Robyn said she was frustrated when she learned that that her father would not have access to the treatment.

‚ÄúTo find out that there was a treatment available, that could be administered to my father to have him recover almost overnight or minimize the effects of the virus on his body, but not have it available was so upsetting,‚Äù Robyn said.

Tavel‚Äôs symptoms continued to get worse, and he eventually ended up back in hospital in a COVID-19 ward.

He says he eventually received a corticosteroid called dexamethasone, which made him feel a bit better. He was eventually discharged from the hospital to recover at home.

While Tavel did make a full recovery, he said he is still frustrated by the experience.

‚ÄúWe have [the drug] in Canada. People are dying, why don‚Äôt we use it?‚Äù he said.

Robyn said she is thankful her father is OK after having contracted the virus, but worries about others who may become ill and need the antibody treatment.

‚ÄúI still have other members of my family in Canada that potentially could become sick with this virus and I need to know that the government is acting quickly to make this treatment available to other Canadians,‚Äù Robyn said.

In the U.S. researchers are also exploring the use of monoclonal antibodies as a preventative option for vulnerable groups, such as immunocompromised patients who do not respond to the COVID-19 vaccines. These patients produce few or no antibodies either as a result of treatments for other diseases like cancer or because they were born with an impaired immune system.

Similarly, bamlanivimab was shown to lower the risk of contracting symptomatic COVID-19 among the residents and staff of long-term care facilities, according to the results of a phase III clinical trial by Eli Lilly conducted in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the COVID-19 Prevention Network.

AN EXTRA TOOL TO FIGHT COVID
As infections continue to rise across much of the country, there are growing calls to tap this overlooked treatment to save lives.

Kumar says provincial leaders and health officials need to come together to figure out a way to implement Bamlanivimab into the health-care system. She said hospitals could set up mobile clinics and infusion centres to help get the antibody therapy out to those who could benefit from it.

‚ÄúThe new data that‚Äôs coming, it shows that these therapies actually prevent death, and they prevent hospitalizations, and if we‚Äôre going to reduce the burden on our emergency rooms and our hospital beds, then we really need to figure out how to use these therapies on a large scale,‚Äù Kumar said.

Miller said the treatment could be especially helpful as Canada continues to face increased hospitalizations due to the disease.

‚ÄúAny extra tools we have, especially in the wake of this very recent third wave, is helpful,‚Äù Miller said. ‚ÄúAnd I think these antibodies have particular benefits for people who may not yet have been able to get their vaccine.‚Äù

Hansen said it is necessary that Canada start administering doses of the treatment to prevent more Canadians from dying of COVID-19.

‚ÄúWe have a therapy here in Canada, it‚Äôs one that has already been paid for, and it‚Äôs sitting on the shelves. Meanwhile, people continue to get sick, and we should take every step that we can to make sure we are getting life saving therapies to patients as soon as possible,‚Äù Hansen said.",,,1619278463,{},gvpt7tq,True,t3_mxm2fl,False,False,t1_gvpt6hh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mxm2fl/canadianmade_covid19_antibody_treatment_sitting/gvpt7tq/,1619291701,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,Million2026,,,[],,,,text,t2_32fr54jm,False,False,[],"TORONTO, Ontario (CTV Network) ‚Äî A Canadian-made COVID-19 antibody treatment is sitting on hospital and pharmacy shelves amid the country‚Äôs third wave of the pandemic because doctors say a plan on how to administer the drug was never made.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs actually very frustrating that we have a therapy available to us that we‚Äôre not actually able to use,‚Äù said infectious disease expert Dr. Deepali Kuma.

Bamlanivimab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The drug mimics the immune system‚Äôs ability to fight off the virus and was developed by AbCellera Biologics Inc. in Vancouver with the support of the federal government, which had committed up to $175.6 million to the company in May 2020 to develop antibody therapies.
According to Health Canada, bamlanivimab may prevent symptoms from becoming worse and reduce hospitalizations in high-risk patients who are infected with COVID-19.

The one-dose treatment, which is sold by Eli Lilly Canada, Inc., can be used in health-care facilities such as hospitals, as it is given by infusion into the veins of patients.

As an antibody therapy, it is part of a major class of drugs normally used to treat diseases like cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, Sachdev Sidhu, a professor of molecular genetics at the University of Toronto, said in an interview.

‚ÄúSo as a method of treatment it is a ‚Ä¶ validated form, so this is not some off-the-cuff methodology,‚Äù said Sidhu, who specializes in antibody engineering.

Health Canada authorized the drug in November 2020 under the interim order respecting the importation, sale and advertising of drugs for use in relation to COVID-19.

According to Health Canada, 26,000 doses of the treatment were purchased for $40 million and distributed amongst the provinces.

However, almost none of those doses have been used.

Countries around the world have been using bamlanivimab to help keep COVID-19 patients out of hospital and reduce deaths for months. More than 400,000 COVID-19 patients worldwide have benefited from the drug, according to Michael McDougall, a spokesperson for Eli Lilly.

There are currently four other types of antibody drugs made by different companies, waiting for approval by Health Canada. The agency told CTVNews.ca that it was expediting these reviews, but could not give a more precise timeline on when a decision might be made.

According to AbCellera Biologics, studies have shown the treatment is effective against SARS-CoV-2, and the variant first identified in the United Kingdom.

Despite this, provincial health authorities have not yet made the treatment available to Canadians.

AbCellera Biologics CEO Carl Hansen told CTV National News it is ‚Äúheartbreaking‚Äù that the drug is not accessible in Canada.

‚ÄúWe are proud to have contributed to a solution that‚Äôs helping so many people around the world, but of course, it would be that much better if this was actually getting to people in our own communities, and was here to protect the ones that we love,‚Äù Hansen explained.

Hansen said that provincial government did not issue a plan on how to administer the treatment, causing doctors to leave it on shelves.

‚ÄúTo think that we‚Äôve invented a therapy here and having taken the steps to bring it to patients is a failure of the system and one I think that needs to be corrected, as soon as possible,‚Äù Hansen said.

CTV News has reached out to provincial health units for comment, but did not hear back before this story was published.

To have a Canadian company get federal funding to develop the drug, see the drug approved, but then have it ‚Äúsitting in the freezer ‚Äî that‚Äôs a mystery,‚Äù Sidhu said. ‚ÄúCanada is dropping the ball.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs recent revocation of bamlanivimab‚Äôs Emergency Use authorization could cause some confusion with the public. A Health Canada spokesperson told CTVNews.ca via email that it was aware of the status change and noted that it was at the request of Eli Lilly, ‚Äúgiven evidence that it is ineffective when used alone against certain COVID-19 variants of concern circulating in the U.S. and the availability of alternative therapies in the U.S. This action was not prompted by a safety concern.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is no change to bamlanivimab authorization in Canada and Eli Lilly has not requested that Health Canada revoke its authorization. Bamlanivimab used by itself is effective against the B.1.1.7 (UK) variant, which is the main variant circulating in Canada at this time,‚Äù said Health Canada‚Äôs Geoffroy Legault-Thivierge.",,,1619278451,{},gvpt6hh,True,t3_mxm2fl,False,True,t3_mxm2fl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mxm2fl/canadianmade_covid19_antibody_treatment_sitting/gvpt6hh/,1619291684,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

We previously saw data from robust, real world, side to side comparisons that suggested at the one dose mark protection against hospitilization with AZ was better than Pfizer.

Kien Giang Province, which shares a 56 kilometer land border with Cambodia and has a 200 kilometer shoreline, has seen many migrants enter Phu Quoc Island illegally via the sea route recently. The provincial People's Committee said over 103,000 Vietnamese are residing in Cambodia, with around 1,700 living in three Cambodian provinces bordering Kien Giang.

Due to its close proximity with Cambodia, the Kien Giang Steering Committee for Covid-19 Prevention and Control said border control is the foremost priority in the coronavirus fight. A total 48 border stations have been erected in Ha Tien Town, which shares 14 kilometer land border and 26 kilometer shoreline with Cambodia, supported by 24-hour patrols.

Nguyen Luu Trung, deputy chairman of Kien Giang People‚Äôs Committee, said disease prevention measures were still in place, but it has since prepared for worst-case scenarios by building field hospitals with up to 500 beds.

Ho Chi Minh City's Cho Ray Hospital and Pasteur Institute have been requested by the Ministry of Health to provide medical workers and establish Covid-19 testing labs in Ha Tien and Kien Giang general hospitals too.

Cambodia has been suffering a spike in infections following its latest wave in late February. Its caseload had jumped to over 8,800 with 61 deaths as of Saturday.

There had been just around 400 infections until last year, but 655 on Friday alone, 446 on Thursday and 303 on Wednesday.

The country‚Äôs capital, Phnom Penh, and a satellite district went into lockdown on April 15 and declared some districts as ""red zones,"" banning people from leaving their homes except for medical reasons.

In An Giang Province, which shares a 100 kilometer land border with Cambodia, there are only two official border gates. But the province has many less-traveled paths, which require provincial authorities to keep their guard up, maintaining 200 border patrols with around 2,000 personnel to keep illegal entrants out.

Nguyen Thuong Le, head of An Giang border guard forces, said the province has persuaded 33,000 families living near the border to sign documents to guarantee no illegal entry and exit. Since the beginning of this year, the province has found over 600 people trying to illegally enter the country and have put them all into quarantine.

Long An Province, which shares a 130 kilometer border with Cambodia, is currently maintaining 40 border stations and patrols. Since the beginning of this year, authorities discovered over 130 illegal entry and exit cases, 95 of whom were foreigners.

Pham Tan Hoa, deputy chairman of the provincial People's Committee, said its border once had 36 border stations, but they encountered challenges when the rainy season came. As such, the province has built an additional 13 stations funded through multiple sources and with land donated by citizens to help patrols with their job, he added.

Tay Ninh Province, which shares the longest border with Cambodia of all, at around 240 kilometers, currently has 123 border stations with over 600 personnel on duty.

Nguyen Thanh Ngoc, chairman of the provincial People's Committee, said the province has deployed multiple measures to prevent illegal entry and exit, including handing out rewards for those who report illegal entry and exit cases and monitoring motorbike taxi services near the border.

Tay Ninh receives and quarantines up to 30 people from Cambodia each day on average, said Ngoc. It has also prepared over 3,000 beds for quarantining, he added.

""To make the Covid-19 fight more effective, the province has supported three Cambodian provinces bordering Tay Ninh (Svay Rieng, Tbong Khmun and Prey Veng) with medical equipment using the state budget,"" he said.

In a meeting with leaders from 10 localities bordering Cambodia on Friday, Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam requested Covid-19 prevention measures to be ramped up to prevent the disease from entering the country.

""If those infected manage to enter the community and participate in events with large gatherings, the consequences would be unpredictable,"" he said.

Dam also said the government would prefer Vietnamese abroad to restrict traveling. If one needs to return to Vietnam due to dire circumstances, they would need to declare themselves so authorities could receive and quarantine them, he added.

He also agreed that those illegally entering Vietnam need to be dealt with in accordance with the law, while stressing that quarantine measures need to be well-implemented to prevent cross-infection in quarantine zones.

Under pandemic prevention protocols, a person entering Vietnam needs to be quarantined for 14 days. Illegal entrants are those sneaking through unmanned paths to evade quarantine.",,,1619277937,{},gvprj88,True,t3_mxm47s,False,False,t3_mxm47s,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mxm47s/vietnam_ramps_up_border_control_as_cambodias/gvprj88/,1619290909,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I‚Äôve had dozens of orders get kicked down the road because a supplier got a new Covid order added to their queue and they kicked my project down the line to make room in their schedule. It‚Äôs gotten to the point that lead times for even simple single-use consumables are at a minimum of 6 months if you are not a Covid project, with some suppliers not guaranteeing any lead time shorter than 60 weeks.

1. Covid vaccines &amp; treatments (Moderna, Pfizer, J&amp;J)

2. FDA approved commercial drugs.

3. Everything else.

Companies (mine included) panic buy at every opportunity because lead times are so bad and we need to maintain business continuity. If the export ban gets lifted for single use consumables and foreign Covid projects get thrown into what is already a disaster, it will only get worse.

Mayor Emil Boc, president of the Association of Romanian Municipalities, said that he will support in the national commission that establishes the measures to relax the COVID pandemic the conditioning of the participation in festivals. Vaccination is the solution.

üì∑

"" *I follow my idea and I will support, because we are also invited, without the right to vote, in this national committee that prepares relaxation measures, as the Association of Romanian Municipalities, to gradually announce the reopening of the economy and events, so that people should know that from the date of, whatever that is, festivals starting with August or September, if you get vaccinated you have access to the festival.* *That's how I give an extra incentive.* *Let people know that they can attend the Untold festival in August or September, if you get vaccinated.*

*If this is announced publicly, I am sure that there will be a greater desire for vaccination, especially among young people who are participating in the festival, or at other festivals.*

*I believe that in May we will have to give this predictability in relation to the relaunch of events and the economy and to say very clearly that it is conditioned by vaccination.*

*You can't stop an entire country, because some don't want to get vaccinated.* *It's their business.* *I respect their right, but you cannot take the right of others to have access to a normal life.* *In May we will have the opportunity to no longer have a waiting list for the vaccine, and it can no longer be said that it is discrimination.* *Until now, rightly, the condition could not be set because there was no place to be vaccinated, with 25,000 people on the waiting lists* "", said the mayor Emil Boc, on[ ZIUA LIVE.](https://zcj.ro/administratie/primarul-din-cluj-sustine-conditionarea-vaccinarii-pentru-participarea-la-festivaluri-va-trebui-in-mai-sa-dam-aceasta-predictibilitate--215815.html)",,,1619229478,{},gvmyi7y,True,t3_mxacfk,False,False,t3_mxacfk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mxacfk/emil_boc_sharp_you_cant_stop_an_entire_country/gvmyi7y/,1619246126,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It is another example in the latest long line of examples of Fauci (and others) trying to be cautious in an attempt to keep people from thinking this pandemic is over when it isn't. While I get where he's coming from and think I see his intent, this messaging HAS TO stop. It is doing considerably more harm than good at this point. 

At least in the US, we are at the point in the vaccinations where everyone who needed to get them (the elderly, those with certain medical conditions, those in close congregate living quarters) has gotten vaccinated, and we're very close to the point where everyone 16+ who wants one either has already been vaccinated or will be very soon. 

We need to turn focus toward selling the vaccine-hesitant on them, and this messaging just isn't how you do it. If you want to convince the hesitant to get them, sell the benefits of the vaccine - 95% protection against infection! 100% protection against serious illness, hospitalizations and death! Eating safely in restaurants again! Gathering with your friends indoors without risk!

The case is a family member of an Indonesian pilot serving at Taiwanese carrier China Airlines (CAL), who flew a cargo flight to Australia on April 20 and upon his arrival, felt itchy in his throat.

The pilot in his 40s was tested positive for COVID-19 in Australia, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (Èô≥ÊôÇ‰∏≠), who heads the CECC, said at a press briefing. Upon learning of the result, the CECC launched an investigation into his activities in Taiwan, identified 58 contacts and tested them.

On Friday, two of the contacts were confirmed positive for COVID-19, including the pilot's teenage son, Chen said, and his colleague in his 50s, also an Indonesian national and a CAL pilot.

The colleague was on duty in the United States between April 4-10, during which he showed no symptoms of illness. He was tested upon his return from the U.S. on April 15 and the results came back negative.

On April 16, the man visited Taipei Grand Mosque along with the other pilot and the pilot's son, even though he felt fatigued and slightly hot. Two days later, he began developing a moderate cough and got better after taking medicine, according to the CECC.

Then on April 21, the man got a self-paid test because he planned to fly home for a family reunion. The results came back positive on Friday.

Chen said although the three had gone to the Taipei mosque together, authorities are still investigating whether or not they are a cluster infection.

While the boy was identified as a domestic case, the source of infection in the case involving the second CAL pilot is still unknown, Chen said.

According to Chen, there were around 400 people attending activities at Taipei Grand Mosque on the day the trio were there, 200 of whom were indoors while the others were outdoors.

Efforts are being made to identify possible contacts, he said, adding that all of the participants wore face masks.

The CECC commander also said that there is no link between the pilot case on Friday and two cases also involving CAL pilots on April 20. The source of their infection is still unknown.

The previous domestic case was recorded on Feb. 9, when one family member of a nurse at Taoyuan Hospital tested positive. The nurse was confirmed on Jan. 18 to have been infected with COVID-19 at the hospital. Since then, a total of six of her family members have contracted the virus.

Meanwhile, the CECC also confirmed two imported cases on Friday, from India and Belgium.

The first case involved an Indian man in his 30s who flew to Taiwan for work on April 6 with proof of negative test results within three days of his flight.

He received a self-paid test on April 21 at the end of mandatory quarantine at a hotel, and the results came back positive. Five of his contacts have been identified, the CECC said.

The second case is a Belgium national in his 40s who also arrived in Taiwan for work on April 6.

During his quarantine at a hotel, he began to suffer from a headache, pain in the throat, a runny nose and abnormality in his sense of smell on April 20. He was then tested at a hospital.

The test results came back positive on Friday, and because the man had made no contact with others during quarantine, there were no contacts listed for the case, the CECC said in its press release.

To date, Taiwan has recorded 1,090 cases of COVID-19, 970 of which have been classified as imported. Of the total, 1,044 have recovered, 11 have died and 35 are in hospital, according to the latest CECC statistics.

Globally, COVID-19 has infected over 144 million people in 193 countries and regions, with more than 3 million fatalities, CECC data shows.

This is a ""100% likely / 0% likely"" question, since the conspiracy theory is 0% likely. Throughout the US and other countries, regular (or even increased!) flu testing was done over the past year.

The positivity rate of flu tests was incredibly small.

Washing hands, wearing masks, social distancing and not gathering in large groups basically killed the flu for humans. Covid is a lot more contagious, so the measures that work to supress covid enough to prevent hospitals from collapsing are more than enough to get flu to R&lt;1.

Many people will often get mild flu-like symptoms after receiving the flu vaccine, but this is actually the body's immune response to the vaccine rather than an actual illness.

Many of the things people associate with being sick are actually the body's response to the infection rather than something caused by the infection itself. Fever, in particular, is a notable example. When you actually get infected with a virus, one of the many things the body does to fight the infection is raise its own temperature; the reason for this is that the elevated temperature will inhibit the viral reproductive cycle and make the infection easier to fight off.

Why does this happen to some people after a vaccine as well? Most traditional vaccines are based on either weakened or inactive viruses. The reasoning behind this is that it gives your body's immune system a chance to recognize the virus, and essentially train itself to destroy it if it ever comes in contact with it again. That's how you develop ""immunity"" to a specific disease; your body has already identified it and essentially stationed soldier cells who recognize it and know how to kill it. Even though a vaccine generally (except in very rare cases) does not actually cause a real infection, the body recognizes the presence of foreign particles and this triggers the immune response which often includes a fever (because the body doesn't necessarily ""know"" that it isn't infected, so it activates its mechanisms for fighting off an infection).

The new COVID-19 vaccines (at least the Pfizer and Moderna ones, I'm not sure about all of them) are actually entirely different from anything we've used before, and instead of using weakened or inactivated viruses are actually based on mRNA and have literally zero chance of causing an actual infection.

&gt;Vinay Srivastava ultimately died without medical care. His death was a stark moment in India's spiraling coronavirus crisis, where reports of new infections have repeatedly exceeded 250,000 per day in the past week.  
&gt;  
&gt;Srivastava, from the northern city of Lucknow, was denied medical care because he lacked crucial paperwork, according to Indian media.  
&gt;  
&gt;On Friday he tweeted in Hindi that his oxygen levels had dropped to 52 ‚Äî far below the normal levels of 95 or above.  
&gt;  
&gt;....  
&gt;  
&gt;**His son Harshit described how he appealed to medical authorities for help. But Srivastava could not be admitted to hospital without a letter from the Chief Medical Officer (CMO)'s office, the outlet said.**¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;**Harshit described approaching three hospitals, which refused to take his father, before heading to the CMO office in Lucknow, where he waited for three hours.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Returning home without a letter, he managed to borrow an oxygen tank from a family member, but still needed to fill it.**  
&gt;  
&gt;""**We ran from pillar to post, but could not get an oxygen cylinder for him,"" he told The Print. ""A relative lent us his own cylinder. I went to get it refilled at midnight. There was a long queue for that too, I had to fight with others to save my father.""**  
&gt;  
&gt;According to The Print, the policy of requiring a CMO's letter ‚Äî in place since last April ‚Äî has been lifted since Srivastava's death.¬†",,,1619290197,{},gvqk055,False,t3_mxq3g5,False,True,t3_mxq3g5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mxq3g5/a_journalist_in_india_livetweeted_his_worsening/gvqk055/,1619305868,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

We already know some possible ways avian flu could mutate into a contagious, deadly virus. We should be making a vaccine for it before that happens, and it should have its safety thoroughly researched before we even have patient zero.

Making vaccines for possible viruses needs to be a thing. Ideally we'll never need any of them. But let's think back two years and imagine the American government had developed a vaccine for a hypothetical SARS virus that uses its spike protein to interface with our ACE2 receptors. A vaccine we knew was safe, and we could quickly manufacture and distribute.

Let's assume it still take four months to distribute 300,000,000 dosees. That would mean that by May 2020, just over four months after the first case was reported in the United States, we'd  have vaccinated over a hundred million people with many, many more partially vaccinated. There *never* would have been a pandemic if we had that kind of vaccine research done in advance.

This sounds insane and impossible, but I'm convinced it's very worth researching because this kind of thing really could save us from ever having to deal with a ""next time."" It took Moderna *[two days](https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-designed-coronavirus-vaccine-in-2-days-2020-11)* to develop their vaccine. *Two days.* That was after sequencing the virus, that was before the Chinese government even confirmed it could be transmitted by humans.

If we combine the research of hypothetical virus mutations we've been doing for decades and the massive fortune of knowledge we've learned about mRNA vaccines during this pandemic, we really could be looking at a paradigm shift in the discussion of novel viruses. I don't know if it would work, but I know that if we're in the next pandemic and we didn't try creating vaccines for hypothetical viruses, especially if it's a virus whose mutations had been posited before, we'd be regretting it deeply and blaming every death on our failure to attempt this.

1. Vaccinated people couldn't cause asymptomatic spread;
2. If they were in the minority who still became symptomatic, particularly, that they couldn't spread nearly as effectively as the unvaccinated.

A 70-90% reduction in symptoms is brilliant, and definitely a success story, but that still leaves the vaccine not working a minority of the time.

**U.S. Influenza Surveillance System: Purpose and Methods**

[https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm)

The U.S. influenza surveillance system is a collaborative effort between CDC and its many partners in state, local, and territorial health departments, public health and clinical laboratories, vital statistics offices, healthcare providers, clinics, and emergency departments. Information in five categories is collected from eight data sources in order to:

* Find out when and where influenza activity is occurring;
* ***Determine what influenza viruses are circulating;***
* Detect changes in influenza viruses; and
* Measure the impact influenza is having on outpatient illness, hospitalizations and deaths.

It is important to maintain a comprehensive system for influenza surveillance for the following reasons:

* Influenza viruses are constantly changing (referred to as antigenic drift), and **thus ongoing data collection and characterization of the viruses are required;**
* Influenza viruses can also undergo an abrupt, major change (referred to as antigenic shift) that results in a virus that is different than currently circulating influenza viruses; **surveillance of viruses will detect these changes and inform the public health response;**
* ***Vaccines must be administered annually*** ***and are updated regularly based on surveillance findings;***
* Treatment for influenza is guided by laboratory surveillance for antiviral resistance; and
* Influenza surveillance and targeted research studies are used to monitor the impact of influenza on different segments of the population (e.g. age groups, underlying medical conditions).",,,1619298752,{},gvr0upn,False,t3_mxqd37,False,False,t1_gvqn6fb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mxqd37/the_flu_vanished_during_covid_what_will_its/gvr0upn/,1619314988,4,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

2.	‚Å†‚Å†Following above they didn't increase manufacturing capabilities. SII was under contractual obligation ; they had to send 100 million vaccines but only were able to send 18 million. Following which UK filed a lawsuit against them. For imported vaccines took praise on themselves.
3.	‚Å†‚Å†Age cap blunder by allowing only 45+ citizens to get vaccinated. Indian Boomer population will bang thalis rather than getting a vaccine. The disinformation campaigns have been huge.
4.	‚Å†‚Å†They didn't increase oxygen production since last year.
5.	‚Å†‚Å†Having paid media works wonders in dissing the ground reality but when actuality spreads like fire in form of cremations, whom will you blame then?
6.	‚Å†‚Å†Just imagine the first stock deal of vaccines India did was in Jan 21; while other nations did it back in May 20.

The causes of the error are not known at this stage. An investigation is underway. A health officer was assigned to the site to strengthen safety procedures.

Can‚Äôt say I disagree here. Now if Dr. Fauci still wants to remain cautious, as he is 80 but although in excellent health time is not on his side, I think that‚Äôs great and a personal decision. Now his words and actions are not persuading more to get vaccinated, he has jumped the shark so to speak. Why would a 30 year old blue collar worker get vaccinated if he is told my the media, who right or wrong put Dr. Fauci in a prominent role, get vaccinated if he doesn‚Äôt see a maskless, restrictionless future?

First off 85.9% is quite different from 99.9%.  Second, the real issue with single dosing the MRNA isn't that it doesn't work, it's that it wasn't tested in the trials so they can't say for sure. Some countries have been  reporting great real world results from just the first dose, but it's not official trial data.

4 people want to go the right because they think they have seen the same to the right.

A month later fatigue and doubt started to set in and comparisons to ‚Äúthe flu‚Äù began to arise. Debates about masks followed, sentiment against mitigation efforts against Covid started to build up and since then you get what we‚Äôve witnessed for the past year.

It was by middle or end of summer last year when I pretty much knew it would be a ‚Äúfend for yourself‚Äù type of situation. Stores didn‚Äôt start making people wear masks until around August, I believe. The mask felt more like protection for yourself than others until people started wearing them more. I still remember that weekend before the big realization in mid March where people at the store looked weird at a few people with masks and gloves on. The weekend after that week, the ones getting looks were those with nothing on.

Holidays just destroyed us and they seemed to just get worse and worse as we progressed to the big ones at the end of the year. I believe the main culprit was simply family gatherings rather than possible efforts at private businesses around that time. Decided to pick up an Xmas gift I ordered online from a mall and when I got there all the spaces were packed. The way things went inside were long ass, ‚Äúsocially distanced‚Äù lines outside of stores while just like 3 or 4 shoppers inside a store at a time. I was banking on being able to go in and out but I underestimated the amount of Xmas shoppers during a pandemic.

Hopefully all of this will soon be behind us as more and more people get their shots to protect them in better ways than a mask has tried to. I‚Äôm really feeling by summer the masks will start leaving and debates will start shifting more and more to the side of people who don‚Äôt want them anymore.

It is reasonable to assume that such events, in some cases, result in the pathogenesis of certain diseases. Our laboratory only tested the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in lung vascular cells and those implicated in the development of PAH. However, this protein may also affect the cells of systemic and coronary vasculatures, eliciting other cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, systemic hypertension, and stroke. In addition to cardiovascular cells, other cells that express ACE2 have the potential to be affected by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which may cause adverse pathological events. Thus, it is important to consider the possibility that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein produced by the new COVID-19 vaccines triggers cell signaling events that promote PAH, other cardiovascular complications, and/or complications in other tissues/organs in certain individuals (Figure 3). We will need to monitor carefully the long-term consequences of COVID-19 vaccines that introduce the spikeprotein into the human body. Furthermore, while human data on the possible long-term consequences of spike protein-based COVID-19 vaccines will not be available soon, it is imperative that appropriate experimental animal models are employed as soon as possible to ensure that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein does not elicit any signs of the pathogenesis of PAH or any other chronic pathological conditions.",,,1619269910,{},gvox9yc,True,t3_mxjnd0,False,False,t3_mxjnd0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mxjnd0/sarscov2_spike_protein_elicits_cell_signaling_in/gvox9yc/,1619277974,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

First of all the types of clots are different, clots caused by birth control are often but not always easily treated while the clots caused by the J&amp;J vaccine are of a type likely to cause high mortality and morbidity. Pregnancy comes with a significantly higher risk of blood clots than BC does, so as with the vaccine, the benefits in preventing the condition outweigh the risks. Also lots of women use BC for reasons that have nothing to do with preventing pregnancy, in fact BC wasn't orginally approved for contraception but to treat hormonal disorders. 

As for male BC, there is a bit more of a hurdle to overcome in terms of bioethics because there is literally no possible health benefit to the person the drug is being administered to. However, the most recent male BC study I am aware of wasn't stopped due to headaches but fits of rage in a small percentage of the participants. Their was some concern about the possibility of the drug resulting in domestic violence. If you can find me a source for a male BC that wasn't approved due to only headaches I'd love to see it.

The healthcare professionals who administered it should have explained this. That aside, this remains staggeringly rare even in your age group. Stop worrying.

It has lower efficacy in preventing *cases* of covid. For severe covid, it has the same efficacy as all the others, 100%. With this vaccine, you are guaranteed not to be hospitalised or killed by covid. AZ efficacy is higher than vaccines for most other diseases. It's not that the AZ vaccine isn't very good, it's just that the mRNA vaccines are amazing. All the vaccines have lower efficacy against variants, we will deal with these variants as they emerge.

On April 21, a Taiwanese national in his 70s was found dead in the quarantine hotel where he was staying, having returned to Taiwan on April 8 from the Philippines, the CECC said.

During quarantine, the man saw a doctor because of a lack of appetite. He was not tested for COVID-19 because he did not have a fever or present respiratory symptoms at the time, according to the CECC.

He tested positive for coronavirus only after being found dead, and was classified by the CECC as an imported case.

Meanwhile, CECC spokesman Chuang Jen-hsiang (Ëéä‰∫∫Á••) said at a press briefing that contact tracing launched on April 21 after a China Airlines cargo flight pilot tested positive for COVID-19 in Australia, led to a new confirmed case among his colleagues.
The new patient is a Taiwanese man in his 40s. Although he had contact on April 7 with the pilot -- an Indonesian national who tested positive in Australia -- the Taiwanese had three negative test results before another result came back positive on Saturday, according to the CECC.

The latest test results, Chuang said, show the patient is in the early stage of COVID-19, the initial conclusion being that the infection is not linked to the Indonesian pilot.

The Taiwanese man is the second cargo flight crew member found to be infected with COVID-19 since April 21. Another Indonesian pilot in Taiwan was confirmed as having COVID-19 on Friday.

In addition, the teenage son of the Indonesian pilot who tested positive in Australia was also found to have contracted COVID-19 on Friday, Taiwan's first domestically transmitted case in over 70 days.

The five other imported cases reported on Saturday came from the Philippines, Indonesia and India, Chuang said.

All had a negative test result within three days of their flights. Two are men in their 20s, who arrived in Taiwan on April 8 to study, according to the CECC.
Both students went to hospital for a COVID-19 test arranged by their schools and the results came back positive, the CECC said.

The remaining three include an Indonesian male fishing worker in his 30s, who developed a cough during quarantine and tested positive, and two Philippine workers -- one man and one woman -- in their 20s.

The two Philippine workers received a COVID-19 test arranged by their employers after they completed quarantine and were subsequently confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus, according to the CECC.

To date, Taiwan has recorded 1,097 cases of COVID-19. Of the total, 12 have died and 40 are still isolated in hospital, according to CECC statistics.

With some help from a therapist, I managed to overcome it all and am now sitting at 185. Start small - focus on eating 3 times a day. It doesn't matter what or how much at first - could literally be an apple. Just eat 3 times a day. Slowly, add quantity until you're eating 3 full meals - don't worry about the calories, just that you're eating fats, proteins, and carbs every meal. 

Do this over a period of a month, and then start adding a snack in between meals. Start very small, again with something like an apple. Once you're used to the quantity, you can start focusing on calories. 

I got called back to work and am on my feet all day and generally active - I also now work out 6 days a week, so I find myself burning 3500-4000 calories a day so I have to eat that much to not lose weight, but after slowly building up, I find it hard NOT to eat that much food. I'm so much better about stopping what I'm doing and eating on even eating WHILE I'm doing something. 

I started in January and have gained 45 pounds since then. If you have someone to hold you accountable, send them a picture every day of your meals. If you don't, hit me up and I'm happy to do this for you.

Yes, you can look at excess death rate and say ""see covid-19 is worse than the spanish flu"", but this is just a b.s. way to look at the data.  Mostly that just means Covid killed off some old people that would have long been dead at their age during the 1920s.

If anything, this data mostly points to how well we've gotten at keeping people alive that something like Covid-19 really stands out in the excess death rate.

I get that NYTimes needs to sell clicks, but mostly what we are looking at is ""people used to die all the time in the 20's, and now they don't, so 3M people dying today looks worse than 50M dying in the 20's"".

That efficacy thing I mentioned was a _huge_ issue. Dose escalation trials are Phase I, not Phase III. And as I said, you can‚Äôt average the efficacy rate when it‚Äôs one or the other.

The first half dose (the 90% effective one, if they get a half dose first and then the second dose a month later) was not tested in patients over age 55. (Why? Because the fact that they discovered starting with a half dose first was due to a mistake. The two full doses a month apart only had 62% efficacy.) 

Later, they also revealed on that the timing between the two doses for some of the initial half dose patients (already a small number) was as much as 3 months apart (instead of 1). 

Some of these issues may have uncovered ways the vaccine could be more effective (why they had a longer time in between shots in this last study) but again, these are not things you ‚Äúdiscover‚Äù at Phase III. 

And there were other things too. Only 12% of all patients were over 55 years of age (compared to Pfizer‚Äôs 43% over age 55 and Moderna‚Äôs 25% over age 65). The AZ study has less minorities enrolled and it included NO obese participants (and I don‚Äôt mean no morbidly obese patients‚ÄîI mean the highest BMI of any participant was 29.1).

But the US is holding onto 30 million doses of AZ in Ohio right now. Which has a shelf life of 6 months and might not ever be used in the US.

Think of it this way: they‚Äôre learning the exact same course material, but different teaching methods. 

Scientists are *very, very* cautious when using words like ‚Äúproof,‚Äù which leads to a lot of confusion comparing them and a lot of mixed answers about whether it prevents infection, transmission, etc., but for all intents and purposes, there‚Äôs currently no reason to think that the immunity from the J&amp;J shot would function any differently long term. While the published protection percentage is lower, that‚Äôs partially a function of the fact that it went through ~~tougher~~ more varied trials. It was tested later on in the pandemic when there was more variants, and extensively in places around the world where those variants are more common. 

The most recent reports I saw indicated that if a second dose of the J&amp;J shot was given ‚Äî or if the mRNA vaccines were tested the same way as the J&amp;J one ‚Äî the protection would be virtually identical (J&amp;J is allegedly working on a second dose that would be used as such).

According to the FDA, it is required for companies to make their ingredients available to the public.  I didn't see anything out of the ordinary, the last time I looked.  MRNA, a lipid, salt, and sugar.  The lipid is to allow the mRNA to merge into the cell wall because it is a lipid itself allowing access for the mRNA.  The salt and sugar is to match the body's salt and sugar levels.  This could be the same possibility of the Pfizer vaccine.  I am sure I am forgetting some details, but this is what I have learned.

Fibrinogen, the protein which is used to make blood clots, is also a  strong predictor of mortality in cardiovascular patients. After vascular  incidents, such as myocardial infarction, fibrinogen concentrations  increase sharply. The free, unclotted fibrinogen protein increases the  ‚Äústickiness‚Äù of red blood cells which stack together forming rouleaux.  This increases the time of the ‚Äúsolid‚Äù blood state which decreases blood  flow through the microcirculation where blood flows like a thixotropic  fluid, switching between a solid phase and a liquid phase, somewhat like  toothpaste. As a solid, it stops oxygen and nutrient flow to the  tissues. This, in itself, can cause tissue damage.

From everything I've seen Fauci, and not just Fauci but he's the most interviewed one, has been dancing around this issue whenever it's brought up in interviews. I'd imagine the concern is that if he acknowledges there's no medical evidence justifying vaccinated people being forced to wear masks, people who aren't vaccinated might say they're vaccinated and not wear a mask.

I've said this a million times on this subreddit but I absolutely despise that reasoning for a lot of reasons. 

1: It diminishes the already tarnished trust in public health officials. If you know there's not a medically sound reason for vaccinated people to wear masks and you tell them to anyway, you're lying. I don't care if it's a ""white lie"" or whatever, what's that line we always hear about medical experts? They're scientists and not politicians? They're impartial? Then they should see that as a consistent standard rather than something they can pick and choose based on expedience.

2: It disincentives vaccinations. The extreme majority of people at serious risk are vaccinated. The remainder are the people who realistically won't die from this virus. We need every tool in the book to motivate them because fear won't work. Telling them they need to still mask up and distance without evidence to support that creates the attitude that they shouldn't bother.

3: You're punishing the majority for the actions of the drastic minority. Even ignoring that we're a couple weeks from most people in the entire country being vaccinated, meaning *most people* will have no medical justification to wear a mask a few weeks after that point when their regimen is completed, most people are generally honest. You cannot base your entire world view around the actions of the worst to define the many. If that weren't the case we wouldn't have so many laws to protect the innocent from persecution on suspicion of criminal behavior. The assumption that most people are good generally defines our country's Justice philosophy, I don't think it's okay to ignore it here and only here.

I'm just so completely opposed to lying about how effective the vaccination is on every single possible angle, it's not even funny how frustrated this makes me. I cannot stand the condescending question dodges and the unapologetic ""Greater good"" lying that we've seen over and over again.

There's no ""more likely"" about it. It's the lockdowns and masks/social distancing wiping out flu. There have been no false diagnoses of flu for covid since mass testing.

In the UK we not only use PCR testing to confirm all reported covid cases, we sequence them meaning we can tell not only that it's covid, but what variant of covid. 

The conspiracy theory that flu is being diagnosed as covid is nonsense, even if you live in a country that doesn't sequence the hell out of covid cases, you can trust that the phenomenon of flu being driven to extinction is real based on countries like the UK that do all this testing.

First 100k+ of total doses in 2 weeks. 1.099 M doses stockpiled across MA now. The continuous streak of a downward trend over the past 9 days has been broken for today.

**CDC** update on first dose shots:

55,489 first dose shots. Last week 48,024. 

7 day rolling avg is now 45,315. 44,249 yesterday. 

3,604,461 MA residents have first doses - 52.30% (3,548,972 - 51.49% yesterday)

65.05% of adults now

**Fully vaccinated estimates**

Using the date for 90% of adults with dose 1, if all of them get a second dose 31 days later (1 month for Moderna), plus an additional 14 days for immunity to kick in, that will put us at a date of: Saturday, July 10th (- 10 days), for 90% of adults fully vaccinated.

Plus, there's T cell immunity (which primarily protects against severe disease), and viruses are much slower in learning how to circumvent that. 

That being said, we still don't know enough about the Indian variant. It does appear to have some degree of immune escape and appears to spread faster than the wild type and likely even the British variant (though that one isn't clear). 

You have to remember, though, that India is a country with little to no regulations like wearing masks (God forbid home office), HUGE population density, vaccination rates in the mid to high single digits (not nearly enough to see any kind of effect), and a fuck-ton of religious ceremonies and protests that require people to gather up in huge numbers.

This is the key behavioral change from last year. When the nation went into lockdown in 2020 the people were by and large of a single mind, to protect themselves, but after a year of incident free living most people are shaped by their subjective experience.

Those who had mild to no symptoms have begun to deny covid and chafe at the restrictions. 

Most people lack the nuance of mind to deal with an uncertain world full of edge cases and exceptions. When the doom prophesized by science doesn't come knocking they decide the scientists are wrong and they know better.
