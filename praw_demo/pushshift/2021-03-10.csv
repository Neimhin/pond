‚ÄúHealthcare providers are required to report to VAERS the following adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination [under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)], and other adverse events if later revised by CDC:

Vaccine administration errors, whether or not associated with an adverse event (AE)
Serious AEs regardless of causality. Serious AEs per FDA are defined as:
 Death;
 A life-threatening AE;
 Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions;
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect;
 An important medical event that based on appropriate medical judgement may jeopardize the individual and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
Cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome
Cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death
Healthcare providers are encouraged to report to VAERS any additional clinically significant AEs following vaccination, even if they are not sure if vaccination caused the event.

Also report any additional select AEs and/or any revised safety reporting requirements per FDA‚Äôs conditions of authorized use of vaccine(s) throughout the duration of any COVID-19 Vaccine being authorized under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).‚Äù

These vaccines are out under what is known as an EUA, for emergency use. The vaccine is basically the biggest clinical trial in human history. Anyone getting the vaccine while under EUA is getting a vaccine that is not proven. We are seeing short term effects but there is absolutely no way to know what the long term effects will be.

You're completely wrong. Canada does have domestic vaccine production. There are large vaccine plants in Toronto (Sanofi) and Quebec City (GlaxoSmithKline)

All of our H1N1 vaccine was produced domestically in 2009, and those production facilities were expanded since then to fulfill all our seasonal flu vaccine needs.

Also, we've had flu pandemic preparedness contracts with those vaccine facilities (including export ban clauses).

&gt;The federal government has paid hundreds of millions of dollars to companies since the last global pandemic to ensure a steady supply of vaccinations for the next outbreak, though they do not apply during the current COVID-19 crisis.

&gt;The contract signed with ID Biomedical in 2001 obliged the government to pay the company a ‚Äúpandemic readiness fee‚Äù and ensured that it would fill Canada‚Äôs vaccine quota before supplying other purchasers, the Senate committee‚Äôs report said.

&gt;The federal government awarded GlaxoSmithKline with a renewed version of the contract in 2011 for $430 million. According to a spokesperson for Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC), the contract made GlaxoSmithKline the government‚Äôs primary provider of influenza vaccine, on an ‚Äúas and when required basis‚Äù until 2021.

That is how unemployment works in pretty much every state.  You get 1/2 of what you normally make (up to a certain point, but if you are at that point you aren't starving).  Then on top of that the government gave that $600, then $400, now $300 bonus per week.  Let's say you were making $500 a week.  Under the unemployment plans you would get $250 plus the government bonus actually paying you more than you were making (even more now that the first $10k is tax free).

Are they Mexican nationals?  That is an issue for Mexico and I sure as shit would not be in favor of risking American lives in order to make sure Mexicans have a job.

Even then I am not even sure how that would work out since they work in California which means you should pay into unemployment into that state and I would bet they would be eligible.

I woke up early for uni, because it was meant to start early, and just as I was about to leave, I checked my email and the lecturer whose class I had first had emailed us, saying that she had a cold, and that under the circumstances, she would not be coming into uni, which at the time I thought was a bit too cautious but I didn't mind cos now I had an extra hour or so to just chill. 

I went on reddit (nothing's changed lol) and there was an announcement on the front page that COVID-19 had been declared a pandemic. I thought it was pretty serious but I highly doubted it'd affect me or anyone I know in Australia, we usually avoid global catastrophes. I checked my uni's group chat and people were saying that it probably wouldn't be long before uni was shut down, which I thought was preposterous at the time.

When I finally did go to uni, the pandemic was one of the only things people were talking about. We discussed the toilet paper situation as it was the only direct effect that the pandemic had had on most of us thus far. One of my friends described an anecdote that her sister had told her about someone sneezing on a train she was on and it being emergency stopped to evacuate, which again I thought was extremely silly, but it was the first time that it dawned on me that this might not be like Swine Flu or Ebola; this might actually have an impact on how I live my life.

And lastly, Sinopharm was given a special permit to sell their vaccine without any actual phase 3 trial data. That permit was only for 3 months so Sinopharm could give them the data. That permit expires in May. To this date, Sinopharm has not given ANY DATA to the Peruvian health ministry and they're just going by what the Arabs are saying(your own linked article).

As 2019 ended with my wife defending her thesis and getting her masters degree, traveling to see our families, and preparing our new years resolutions for a fun and interesting year, we had no idea what was in store for us.

First came not taking it seriously, the toilet paper surge and not being prepared for masks. I still remember sometime in late March going to a bar and talking about all the crazy things happening around us while a host dropped some very greasy pizzas on our table. The stores became hellscapes and I resorted to cutting up some old bed sheets to make some low quality bandanas to wrap around our faces.

Next came work from home. My wife started teaching virtually and I lugged home my monitors and docking station. The first few weeks were fascinating but it became the new normal fairly quickly. April through October kind of felt like the same thing. Unfortunately my office was extremely anti-covid and doing some fairly unsafe things so I decided to look for something new and left in October.

I also passed a pretty major licensing exam in the middle of it! Driving to a testing center, taking a proctored exam while masked up and spread apart, and then having my computer crash every 15 minutes was a trip.

It definitely hurt not seeing any family members at all throughout this. Been doing a whole lot more video calls but it's definitely been hard since a lot of them have not been taking it as seriously. First winter we spent alone, but also first Christmas we got to be with our pets as they didn't have to get boarded so that was a small silver lining I guess!

Covid definitely has done a number on mental health and conspiracies. My wife had a massive falling out with her brother and that kinda spilled over to her mom since the brother is ""taking care of her"" (dude is borderline and has autism, it's probably the other way around tbh). Definitely hurts, all he wants to talk about are things about an underground cabal or microchips. It's crazy. 

2021 is shaping up to be pretty hopeful though! My wife is getting her vaccine this weekend! My new job pays a lot more! We're moving to a much nicer apartment next month! And we're planning a trip to see my family in early May! And it's still crazy to see that globally, we're already vaccinating over 325 million people!

Clinical trial data: https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PFIZER_CHART_NEW.png?w=1800 there is clearly signs of protection around day 11, so if we take the the incubation period into account, the protection should have began earlier than that, around day 2-6 (average incubation periods have been estimated to be 5-8 days)

Real world data: Israel's research found almost no protection at 2 weeks, but around 90% protection at 3 weeks. ""After initial injection case numbers increased to day 8 before declining to low levels by day 21. **Estimated vaccine effectiveness was pretty much 0 at day 14 but then rose to about 90% at day 21 before levelling off.** The cause of the initial surge in infection risk is unknown but may be related to people being less cautious about maintaining protective behaviours as soon as they have the injection."" https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250957v1 ‚ÄúSurprisingly, the daily incidence of cases increased strongly after vaccination till about day eight ‚Äì approximately doubling.

The most likely explanation for the gap: the trial volunteers did as they were told, behaved exactly as if they didn't get a vaccine, and saw steady rise in protection.

COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca: PRAC preliminary view suggests no specific issue with batch used in Austria Share
News 10/03/2021
The Austrian national competent authority has suspended the use of a batch of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca (batch number ABV5300) after a person was diagnosed with multiple thrombosis (formation of blood clots within blood vessels) and died 10 days after vaccination, and another was hospitalised with pulmonary embolism (blockage in arteries in the lungs) after being vaccinated. The latter is now recovering. As of 9 March 2021, two other reports of thromboembolic event cases had been received for this batch.

There is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions, which are not listed as side effects with this vaccine.

Batch ABV5300 was delivered to 17 EU countries1 and comprises 1 million doses of the vaccine. Some EU countries2 have also subsequently suspended this batch as a precautionary measure, while a full investigation is ongoing. Although a quality defect is considered unlikely at this stage, the batch quality is being investigated.

EMA‚Äôs safety committee PRAC is reviewing this issue; it is investigating the cases reported with the batch as well as all other cases of thromboembolic events, and other conditions related to blood clots, reported post-vaccination. The information available so far indicates that the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than that seen in the general population. As of 9 March 2021, 22 cases of thromboembolic events had been reported among the 3 million people vaccinated with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca in the European Economic Area.

PRAC will continue its assessment of any potential issue with the batch as well as its review of thromboembolic events and related conditions.

EMA will further communicate as the assessment progresses.",,,1615458544,{},gqk42be,True,t3_m2n4fy,False,True,t3_m2n4fy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m2n4fy/denmark_suspends_use_of_astrazeneca_vaccine_over/gqk42be/,1615458555,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There is.  Lots.

Twelve months ago the UK had no vaccine production capability.  The Government was worried that if all production was outside of the country they could end up not getting vaccines due to export bans being implemented elsewhere.

As part of the agreement with Astrazeneca the UK Government paid for production facilities to be setup in the UK and purchased the first 100m doses that were made there.  This was around April last year and took a long time to get dialed in and producing properly.  40m doses were originally estimated to be ready before the end of 2020 but only a fraction of that were able to be made.  The lower number was due to initial problems getting the lines setup.

The EU signed a deal with Astrazeneca in August last year and following that paid for production facilities to be setup to produce in Belgium where i believe the doses made there were specifically for use by the EU.  This was done much later than the UK they had problems at the Belgium plant but as it was setup later hadnt had time to iron them out in time to start producing for when they were needed.  The EC thought doses were being sent from the Belgium plant to the UK so raided it and found that this wasn't happening and problems were due to low yield.

There was some fill and finish done in the Netherlands early on for the UK but only with vaccine manufactured in the UK and shipped over there.  The EU hasn't shipped any AZ vaccines produced there to the UK its only Pfizer ones that they ship over.  

This is just a summary and there is lots more around this.  The UK has been accused of having a ban on exports which isnt true.  There is no law that restricts exports of vaccines (or components) from the UK its just that the initial doses produced at the factories here have been purchased by the UK government.  The EU on the other hand has implemented laws that can be used to restrict exports and Italy did this very recently.  

The EU were later in setting up AZ production and are now experiencing problems because of this.",,,1615493403,{},gqm0nb6,False,t3_m2wbvx,False,True,t1_gqlu273,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m2wbvx/eu_figures_show_major_vaccine_exports_despite/gqm0nb6/,1615497087,-2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

First of all AZ is the vaccine that provide the poorest results in their clinical trial (62.5% efficacy) with a 4 week dosing interval, and correspondingly faired much worse in South Africa. Janssen‚Äôs efficacy against DG614 isnt that bad; it was 72% and saw a drop in South Africa. But we now have two vaccines that both demonstrated notably higher efficacy than AZ‚Äôs against the predominant form of the virus and displayed efficacy that was in the same ballpark in South Africa. Plus, laboratory studies have indicated a significant but not debilitating drop against B.135 using sera from those that were vaccinated with either Pfizer or Moderna‚Äôs vaccine. Also all the vaccines we have target the same region of the spike. Taken all together we can make reasonable (but not concrete assumption) that mRNA vaccines will remain effective against B.135, and likely be within the range of efficacy we have seen from Novavax and Janssens vaccine.

Also beyond that both Janssens and AZ‚Äôs vaccine use vector technology they are notably different, as I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware AZ uses a simian Adenovirus

They're trying to say mandating masks only prevented 2% of cases.

Compound this over the course of a month, so 2% decrease every day for 30 days, and it's well over a 20% reduction in cases.

When you look at Israel's numbers you need to account for two things.

1. Cases are high because we have a lot of unvaccinated kids and open schools. 50% of new cases are 19 and down, with many under 16. A lot of the new cases are also among the 20-40 demographic which has lower % vaccinated than the 40+. Especially among the 20-30's.
2. When it comes to severe cases, it's the vaccine sceptic populations that suffer most. 45% of all new severe cases are Arabs, which have exhibited a significant anti vaxx sentiment (the mini wave did cause a spike of vaccination among them, but it's going to take a few weeks to effect the number).

But, any of those disorders probably indirectly increases risk. As someone with ADHD, I‚Äôm always so fascinated reading about how much likelier we are to have worse outcomes with, like, everything. ADHD correlates with obesity, substance abuse, lower educational/socioeconomic status (relative to the social class someone was born into), being arrested/incarcerated, being a victim of crime, lower life expectancy overall, etc.

So, if he‚Äôs someone who has, like, severe ADHD and depression that results in him having really shitty physical health (for example, he‚Äôs morbidly obese due to ADHD-fueled binge eating, and has poorly managed diabetes as a result of the obesity and depression-fueled apathy that reduces his compliance with treatment), then sure, his mental illnesses (depression/anxiety) and neurodevelopmental disorder (ADHD) are certainly increasing his risk, albeit indirectly.

BUT, the key thing to remember is that, in a situation like the example I just gave, the DIRECT causes of the increased risk (the physical conditions, obesity and diabetes) are already accounted for in the government‚Äôs ranking system (depends on your state, mine counts obesity but not everywhere does). So in my opinion, it‚Äôs pretty disingenuous for a person to claim that ADHD, etc. makes them at higher COVID risk, UNLESS their mental condition(s) have caused or are causing them to have some physical condition(s) that are directly increasing their risk - in which case, their eligibility is based off of the physical condition(s).",,,1615436811,{},gqj7e0o,False,t3_m1sj8m,False,False,t1_gqiqtlx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m1sj8m/daily_discussion_thread_march_10_2021/gqj7e0o/,1615441100,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Remember, at the US's peak, infections per day per 100k people were hovering right around 70, and that only happened briefly for a few days.

3. While 50% of the population is now 2 weeks after 1st dose, only 38.5% are actually fully protected now. That's a big difference.

Some areas are definitely experiencing herd immunity, but you need to understand that vaccination rate is not uniform across the nation and demographics.

What is it with you guys and this whole fear thing.  It is not fear.  It is a logical conclusion in determining what interactions are important and what are not.  We need to keep interactions at a minimum, and keep them well distanced in order to keep the spread at a minimum.  That saves lives.  Work is very important to keep society going.

[],,ps2veebee,,,[],,,,text,t2_62hsq6ii,False,False,[],"I remember the year season by season.

I had been seeing reports since near the turning of the year. Wuhan, Iran, and more. There was no doubt about it - this was going to be the big one. Still, I went to the evening philosophy class I had been taking. I had an N95 from wildfire season. On the day we had our last in-person class I wore it the whole time, on the bus there and back. There weren't many people around with masks, and nobody else in my class had one.

The resulting spring was a silent one with a city that was suddenly pushed into lockdown. The professor thought at first we could just ""go to a coffee shop"". By the end of the week that plan was off. Then he resisted the idea of video calls. Then, like everyone else, he had Zoom lectures. I never attended, just did the homework.

I had to figure out some new way of getting exercise since the gyms had closed. I recalled the resistance bands I had, and started taking them with me on walks. I got very familiar with the exercises you can do using bands, and still do them now. There was a lucky break where I failed to secure the band and it went flying up into my forehead, leaving a gash. Good thing it missed my eyes. (I limit the kinds of movements I do now, and wear eye protection where there is some risk).

I took to picking up coffee, at first a few times a week, gradually every day. It's just a thing to do to feel connected. The order is fast, in and out. Getting Starbucks I would order online. Lower risk that way.

I had to figure out work from home. I already worked from home, but a good part of that time was not at home but in coffeeshops and libraries and coworking sessions. I tried using the storeroom my parents had been renting for decades. It had very poor wireless access, no bathrooms, no polarized power plugs. So really, it just wasn't a good space to use for a lengthy period.

I sunk into lengthy periods of MMO playing. Planetside 2 became a familiar friend and I would sometimes go all night playing.

By summer I had embraced using the outdoors more, sitting on the park grass. So what if I got some dirt on my jeans? And my priorities were gradually shifting. I tried to organize home and storeroom, tossing a few things, but also buying things. Retail therapy. Gradually I developed a principled approach and found that really. if I created a space for a thing, with some kind of division, like a binder, tray or box, I was automatically more organized than a pile, and this became a project in itself. I upgraded the ergonomics of working at home, got wireless gear and a monitor arm and a lap desk. Floor sitting and fully supinated became two common postures and my mousing switched to trackball and trackpad.

And then the wildfires came and I could not stick to my rhythm of daily walks, not with 150 AQI. I had to stay inside and sweat in humid air. This was the most intense and trying period. I would pace, do burpees. Anything to keep myself from being collapsed in a chair staring at the screen for so long.

By wintertime I had lost the summer habits from so many smoky days. It was cold, hard to stick to bands training. Finally I dug up the dumbbell set, something I should have done earlier. I switch between both now, and sometimes jog when I'm out. It would be so much better to have training partners. My parents are not that, though. They are old and stuck in their ways, and while they stayed safe and now have the vaccine, they got through the year with incessant discussion of politics, pacing in the backyard, and not a lot of personal reflection.

As the year wore on I did more journaling, and then thought, on one of these cold days, that I could just record my journal on my phone. A few months later I just committed to regular self talk on walks, no recording needed. This let me deal with so many issues, just vocally letting them out. It gave release to a cluttered mind.

I developed a deep expertise in simulation pinball, and even worked on making one of my own. The pandemic became an opportunity to bring a niche skill to a great level. It let me really slow down for once, more than I had before, relax, loosen my grip, and shift to other things, new projects, principles. I have many new projects now, and my social bonds have shifted a little, mediated as they are by irritating voice calls and text chats.

On the whole, I got through things with optimism and dedication. One step at a time.

It might not be simple, but neither is adjusting your life to prevent spreading the virus. 

&gt;	So that means the government should not make any laws. Anarchy it is. You are a laugh riot. Your logic is just beautiful.

There are plenty of laws that don‚Äôt favor one person‚Äôs beliefs over another. Be honest and stop making fallacies.

So then what‚Äôs the issue? It‚Äôs not the government‚Äôs job to decide who gets to be happy and comfortable. 

&gt;	People working is important. We need that. We don‚Äôt need people to attend baseball games at max capacity. 

People are employed by others attending baseball games right? Is working no longer important now?

&gt;	What is it with you guys and this whole fear thing. It is not fear. It is a logical conclusion in determining what interactions are important and what are not. We need to keep interactions at a minimum, and keep them well distanced in order to keep the spread at a minimum. That saves lives. 

Sounds like fear to me. Fear can be the logical conclusion. It also can cause an illogical conclusion. Are we going to consider the lives saved by people getting out and doing what they enjoy? Not everyone can lock themselves up for multiple years and survive. 

&gt;	A packed baseball game is not important. No baseball team is going under. They will be just fine at partial capacity and proper distancing.

Didn‚Äôt you previously say proper distancing can‚Äôt completely prevent spread? If so, why is some amount of risk ok? What‚Äôs the acceptable risk level for you? And why do you think you get to decide what the acceptable risk level is for others?

&gt;	You are the most severe example I have seen yet of the person that starts from what they want and then creates reality around it. You don‚Äôt start from a logical premise and go to a logical conclusion. You start from a conclusion you want. Then you fit in insane ideas you think supports it and don‚Äôt even have the mental capacity to realize how none of it works. It is amazing reading the logic you have on this.

So what do I want? That should be an easy question to answer right?

My original comment was removed by the mods for some reason.

Italy, just 7 days ago denied the export of 250 thousand vaccines to Australia. 

Please read the article for confirmation before deleting this mods.

The EU is looking out for its own, it is expected, but don‚Äôt try to sugar coat it.

AZ has contracts with many countries. The EU will not allow any export distribution of vaccines  unless it‚Äôs quotas are met. But what about other countries quotas with AZ? The EU says they don‚Äôt matter.

What does that mean in practice? Other countries will have extended delays on their shipments of the vaccine. 

Australia has barely vaccinated anyone. Someone cited Belgium as ‚Äúonly‚Äù 7% vaccinated as a reason, Australia is lower than that it‚Äôs barely started.

So call a spade a spade. The EU is looking out for its own first, it‚Äôs expected. But don‚Äôt pretend they are somehow morally superior.  

The EU still buys gas from Russia and signed a last minute investment deal with China. This is despite the EU always proclaiming moral superiority regarding human rights and democracy. Those two countries abuse human rights on an unprecedented scale.

No one had been infected by it and, thus, the human population had never developed any immunity from either antibodies or T-Cells (we can debate how much cross-over immunity exists in people from infections from other coronaviruses). So once people were infected it spread without stop gaps of previously infected people to not transmit the virus. Think of it as fire breaks in a forest fire. Those fire breaks prevent the spread of a forest fire to the rest of the forest. Immunity from those infected will stop infections to those not infected.

Now, if COVID-19 comes around to a population that has already seen it, it will have a harder time moving around in the population. Some people will still have varying levels of immunity that is stronger or weaker than others, some people might still have antibodies while other people will have T-cell protection, some people will have cross immunity.

Doesn't mean people won't get infected or, maybe even, re-infected (much like people can get colds from the same family of coronaviruses but the impact on a person can be different). But, the impact will much smaller on a societal view while individuals might feel the brunt but most likely will not suffer much more than a couple of days of being under the weather.

Then there was the re-open and eat-out-to-help-out, I remember the heaving crowds in the town's restaurant district and the complete lack of masks and social distancing among the students aged people. The aircraft industry tanked and my boss got fired to save money along with 10-20% of our workforce. I ended up doing his job for 25% less than he was paid.

Second lockdown people knew what they were doing, and we'd had work from home set up for some time. It was difficult but we stayed home apart from food shopping, which is presumably where my household caught covid. That was when I stopped running, because even cooking a meal got me out of breath. The months between Second and Third Lockdown are a long covid blur, which only got to a liveable point in the new year.

Third Lockdown has been about a sense of growing hope as the vaccines roll out. I check the tracker most days, just to see the percentage vaccinated number increase. The aircraft industry is still in shambles, and the company I work at is starting once again to show worrying signs of insolvency. My partner was fired for having Long Covid for too long, but we've got her on an online degree and set up with a job building safety equipment for when there's no breathable air in an area.

[],,UckyDucky15,,,[],,,,text,t2_oqg6bpa,False,False,[],"I remember the beginning of the lockdown vividly. I was (still am) a resident physician in a surgical subspecialty just half-way through my first year of residency. My child turned 1 year old the week of the lockdown. 

Specifics I remember during those first few months:

\- February was a weird month. I knew COVID had entered the country, but no one would wear PPE. I remember thinking it was so absurd that we weren't wearing PPE in the hospital. I happened to have a few n95 masks from some carpentry side jobs I had been doing and so I would wear one to the hospital. At that time, it looked bad to wear a mask. I would walk the halls with my n95 when no one else was wearing a mask. The nurses would yell at me and tell me to take my mask off. I didn't. I thought they were crazy.

\- My sister was super paranoid and before anyone thought to, bought an n100 half-mask which she mailed to me - ""bless her soul.""

\- We wanted to throw a birthday party for my 1 year old but we decided that it wouldn't be safe given the unknown spread of the virus at the time. We had just one friend over for his birthday. It was super low key, but I'm glad we made that decision 

\- That week, my residency program announced ACGME Pandemic Response - we were being pulled from our service to do COVID shifts in the ICU/Floors, all elective surgical cases were cancelled. I remember shaking in bed with my wife next to me the night before my first COVID ICU shift thinking, ""Honey, I don't want to die."" 

\- My wife and child left the day after his birthday to go to my wife's parents to isolate. They stayed there for 1 month while I did ICU shifts. I wore my n100 mask that my sister gave me. I remember feeling like I needed to wear eye protection. I couldn't find goggles anywhere and face shields were not a thing yet so I wore swimming goggles haha! I looked like a total idiot, but hey, I never got COVID, and I have 0 regretzzz!

\- Grocery stores SOLD OUT of everything essential. We did cloth diapers so I had a toilet bowl diaper sprayer. I remember not feeling too worried about not having toilet paper because I had a bidet basically. 

\- The hospitals started selling toilet paper, eggs and milk in the food market. HAHA! A roll cost like 89 cents. 

\- One of our co-residents got COVID and died about 2 weeks later. That was the first time it really hit close, like we lost one of our comrads. It was a really uncomfortable feeling. 

\- After about a month of doing COVID shifts and not getting sick, I felt really confident in my paranoid PPE (with goggles and a half-mask, which at the time was more valuable than gold). My wife and kid came back and life was so much better. When I saw my child for the first time in person after a month, he looked so much bigger and different. It broke my heart how much he'd changed just after a month and I missed it all. After that we decided to not separate again no matter how bad the pandemic got. 

\- I remember at the peak of the pandemic scrolling through the hospitals EMR. Literally every single room in 5 different hospitals were completely filled with patients admitted for  ""COVID-19 Pneumonia"" or ""Hypoxic Respiratory Failure related to COVID-19 Pneumonia."" It was unreal scary. 

\- My hospital ran out of ventilators and patients were being intubated in the ER. My ER resident friend told me that they were having conversations with family members asking for permission to withdraw care because they literally had no way of sustaining life. 

\- The next 2 months, the ACGME Pandemic response continued and all surgical cases were cancelled still. I had to work COVID shifts, but I would have random weeks where I had nothing going on. This was some of the best times I've had since having our child. My wife, kid and I did a lot of traveling and outdoor activities with our weeks off. After working 70-80 hours a week, having these many random weeks of was AMAZING! 

\- With more free time on my hands, I worked out a lot, especially the month that my wife and kid was gone. I knew that being overweight was a risk factor for serious COVID illness, so that was a pretty big motivator to lose weight. Over 3 months I lost 50 pounds! 

\- Every business on the planet was giving discounts to healthcare workers. So with my stimulus checks, I got so much discounted shoes and clothing.

It's not really a huge deal to me if some people are gaming the system like this and claiming to be eligible when they actually aren't and as a result getting a vaccine a month or two earlier than they would have otherwise. Ultimately, the goal is to get as many people as possible vaccinated, and very soon everyone who wants to *will* be vaccinated, so I'm much more concerned with convincing those who are on the fence to also get vaccinated. If you asked me, would I rather have someone game the system and get vaccinated earlier, or choose not to get vaccinated at all, I would not even hesitate to say the former! More vaccinated people is better. I even think it's the right thing that they aren't really being too rigorous about asking people for proof of eligibility, and focusing more on vaccinating whoever is in front of them instead of strictly enforcing rules at the expense of making it more difficult to prove they're eligible/deserving/whatever.

I just think we should be honest about what the consequences of people lying about eligibility to get a vaccine earlier are: the same number of people ultimately get vaccinated and in approximately the same amount of time, but it takes a little longer to collect enough vaccine doses to vaccinate all the people who *are* eligible now (generally because they are in a higher-risk group) before we move on to the *next* eligibility group.

I heard something about this virus in China causing unexplained flu-like symptoms, but dismissed it. Many of us thought this was going to be a blip on the radar.

In February, me and my family fell ill around the same time. My mom had a cough that wouldn't go away. My dad had flu symptoms but tested negative for the flu. I had mild cold symptoms. We didn't know much about the Coronavirus yet (although looking back, I suspect we had it then).

March comes and I see the following headline: ""NBA suspends season. Trump bans entry from Europe"". We're told the move to the new office is delayed until April and to work from home for at least a month.

I was hoping out hope that this would be all over by the summer and we'd be back to normal. How wrong I was. Everything was shut down or cancelled for the rest of the year. I live in Atlanta and never seen the streets so empty and traffic so light.

One year later, me and my family are fully vaccinated and things are starting to open up again.

[],,anglophile20,,,[],,,,text,t2_nqbde,False,False,[],"a year ago I lived in a downtown apartment with two roommates and my boyfriend lived in the mountain town 30 minutes away in his own (much smaller) place. When we had to work from home and it was clear that things were going to shut down, I took my cat and some things and stayed with my boyfriend with his cat. It definitely changed my mojo with my kitty for awhile. She had to move to a new place, and had to deal with a very unfriendly kitty who didn't want her there. It must have been so scary for her :( . There wasn't even enough room to introduce them properly or get another litter box! I held on hope that this would end after two months. Which, by the way, seemed like FOREVER. Two months later it didn't end but things at least relaxed. We looked for a house and found a house in the summer. We also did a lot of run groups, camping trips, and park events in the summer so it wasn't a summer of isolation by any means. We moved into our new house in the fall with lots more space. Got a kitten, so now we have three cats and they are so much happier since they have all the space in the world. Two months into the pandemic, had to start ending the downtown apartment which ended up being very complicated with one roommate who refused to pay any rent or even communicate with us about breaking the lease. I really miss that place, it was so fun especially in the spring when I could hear the baseball games going on on my deck, since it is right next to the baseball stadium. I miss the city being at the tip of my fingers. In our new location between the mountain town and city, the city is only like a 25 minute drive at least. 

It felt like this: when I was a teenager I got punished for being on IMing after the time I was supposed to log off and do my homework. I was staying with my aunt/uncle for a few months so I didn't know what their punishing style would be. My mother was very direct and would be pretty flexible if I learned the lesson. My aunt and uncle were different, they'd whisper about me and I'd anxiously wait for an answer on what was going to happen. I didn't know how long I'd be punished for and that was so stressful. That's what this felt like in the beginning.

We were super lucky with work, it wasn't a terrible headache to work from home. I would do it all the time beforehand, and my boyfriend managed to get set up to do some remote stuff. He goes in more frequently now because he works with hardware. 

In the summer I'd ask myself what's missing, since I was doing a lot of normal summer stuff outdoors. I'd ask myself, why am I tired of all of this when I haven't even lost that much? I was lucky with work, I'm not around high risk people, etc. A lot of it is knowing that you can do whatever you want even if you have no desire to do it. I don't really go to concerts or nightclubs but it's nice knowing that that's a thing that's normal and okay. And I miss big festivals, races, and sports games. I miss my run clubs having forty people in a brewery afterwards. The most stressful thing for me has been the divide it's created between people. I'm on a subreddit about a TV show and a year ago the subreddit created a daily covid discussion, and it's just awful. They slam people and call them evil for seeing their friends or travelling or doing anything that doesn't involve them being locked down. Even now with vaccines underway, they still do it. I hate the media and how much they try to twist everything into a panic, even when things are getting better. At the beginning - we need to stay inside for a bit and not overwhelm hospitals? Cool. That makes sense. And then we move towards figuring out how to live with this while we wait for a vaccine. Once we have the most important people vaccinated? We move forward. We move on. 

Anyways, most people have had it much worse. I really feel for the people dealing with unemployment, people who have to stay isolated because of high risk family members, and the school kids (grade school and college) who have lost the last part of last year and this year too.",,,1615501476,{},gqmill3,False,t3_m2k60w,False,True,t3_m2k60w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m2k60w/the_yearlong_reflection/gqmill3/,1615505942,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Health professionals dying in the line of duty, graveyards who cant make burials fast enough and people got get in a car accident who cant find an ICU for a really preventable death.  


Its human life loss we're talking here, remember when we would be scared of a plane or a train crashing, and would be outraged by 100, 200 dead? this is way out of proportion.  


When measuring human life, statistics shouldnt do the job of undermining the loss, and certainly we shouldnt as well, it just dehumanizes us by naturalizing the pain all these people are feeling.  


You see, there is no gain whatsoever in downplaying these numbers right now, but its very important for us to think what 2000 is like, and imagine these people died gasping for air.

It‚Äôs a reasonable point since it still creates an incentive to get it and it‚Äôs not inherently discriminatory. So I‚Äôd like to change my stance on government enforcement.

Even if patents were ignored, there isn't any evidence provided to show if other factories could even effectively manufacture (or store) created vaccines.

Accusing ""richer"" countries of ""hoarding"" the vaccine when large swathes of Europe and Canada don't even have a supply is ludicrous. Unless they are counting unfulfilled 'orders' as legitimate supplies there isn't any evidence to suggest hoarding or unfair distribution.

It's also interesting that one of the initial countries calling for the suspension of patents is India, who has repeatedly donated hundreds of thousands of vaccines to other countries.

The Supt. had to enter my apartment to take care of a repair job in the bathroom. He wore a mask. He had the bathroom door closed while he worked. I wore a KN-95 mask. I opened windows after he left to ventilate as best I could before taking my mask off after he left.

That was all it took for me to get Covid. Having the Supt. in my apartment to fix a leak.

I later found out he had children in his household quarantining from school where they had been exposed. Nobody told him he had to stay in quarantine too. So he went about his job like any other day and brought me a side order of Covid.

All this reopening they are doing before people are actually vaccinated is coming at a cost. And they are not even going to start testing vaccines for school children until the fall. I think we can all do the math.

While it is now widely accepted that host inflammatory responses contribute to lung injury, the pathways that drive severity and distinguish coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from other viral lung diseases remain poorly characterized. We analyzed plasma samples from 471 hospitalized patients recruited through the prospective multicenter ISARIC4C study and 39 outpatients with mild disease, enabling extensive characterization of responses across a full spectrum of COVID-19 severity. Progressive elevation of levels of numerous inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (including IL-6, CXCL10, and GM-CSF) were associated with severity and accompanied by elevated markers of endothelial injury and thrombosis. Principal component and network analyses demonstrated central roles for IL-6 and GM-CSF in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Comparing these profiles to archived samples from patients with fatal influenza, IL-6 was equally elevated in both conditions whereas GM-CSF was prominent only in COVID-19. These findings further identify the key inflammatory, thrombotic, and vascular factors that characterize and distinguish severe and fatal COVID-19.",,,1615435684,{},gqj5jc2,True,t3_m2hes2,False,True,t3_m2hes2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m2hes2/inflammatory_profiles_across_the_spectrum_of/gqj5jc2/,1615440299,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I have seen myself change in this pandemic.  I knew that entering this extended lockdown would be like entering a dank room with nothing but my demons and a rusty chain, and boy did I exorcise some demons.  It pains me but my friends were not so lucky.  I have seen them make foolish mistakes they regret.  Could they have made those mistakes in better times when the world was more sane?  Or have I simply seen a truth unbeknownst to me before?  I shudder to think it is the latter, because it would not only mean I made decisions in great ignorance, but now have to make decisions with truth.

One year ago today, I was a cockey 21 year old ready to face the world.  Now I have seen my country assailed, the very gates of our democracy assaulted.  I have seen countless atrocities against humanity.  I have seen unrest that required national guard in my downtown.

I have seen so much atrocity and yet so much life and vigor.  I have seen people resist, I have seen people live.  I have seen people endure this hardship and persist.  Through my liquid crystal windows, my eternal connection to mankind's eternity, I have seen worlds of change.

&gt;The logic behind combining vaccines

&gt;In addition to the practical advantages of being able to switch between vaccines, a combo approach could induce greater immune responses if the two shots use different platforms, says Shan Lu, a physician-scientist and the director of the Laboratory of Nucleic Acid Vaccines at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Scientists call this strategy heterologous prime boosting. ‚ÄúThe format of the vaccine is different, but the antigen is the same,‚Äù Lu explains. For example, the prime shot could deliver the instructions for cells to make the spike protein via RNA, while the booster could be a viral vector vaccine or one based on a recombinant version of the spike protein, says Lu. No recombinant protein COVID-19 vaccines have yet received widespread approval, but those from US company Novavax and the Russia-based Vector Institute are currently in Phase 3 trials.

&gt;A robust immune response involves not only virus-neutralizing antibodies but also helper T cells, which boost antibody production, and cytotoxic T cells, which clear away infected cells. T cells are therefore likely to be important for long-lasting immunity, and two non-peer reviewed studies suggest that they are better than antibodies at thwarting SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro.

&gt;Previous studies on other diseases have found that while some vaccine formats are better at inducing antibodies, others do a better job at stimulating T cell production. DNA and mRNA vaccines provoke the body to produce the antigen itself, a process that activates T cells and facilitates the production of antibody-producing B cells, explains Lu. In contrast, ‚Äúprotein vaccines or inactivated vaccines don‚Äôt involve T cells very much because the antigen isn‚Äôt actually produced inside the body,‚Äù he says.

 
&gt;By combining different vaccine formats that rev up different arms of the immune system, ‚Äúyou can get the best of both worlds,‚Äù says Wolfgang Leitner, the chief of the innate immunity section at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ‚ÄúIf you alternate between platforms, it turns out you can get more than the sum of the two. . . . They seem to work synergistically.‚Äù But, he adds, ‚Äúto be honest, we don‚Äôt understand the mechanisms yet.‚Äù

I also remember the WHO delaying calling it a pandemic and people over at the subreddit China_flu in distress about it before Coronavirus took over as the default sub. 

I knew shit got real when they cancelled the NCAA tournament, I‚Äôm not the biggest sports fan but shutting down March Madness indicated this was no fire drill. 

I commend the ingenuity of the successful vaccines, treatments, and truth that came through out of all the pre-print spam and discussion over at COVID19.

I found all the lockdown debate and masking becoming political. This was unfortunate, but the truth I have observed is that most people in power have had as much control over this natural disaster as if it was a hurricane; it‚Äôs nice to think you have power over it, but all jurisdictions got their spikes eventually. At first, lockdowns were to figure out what the hell was going on and to see how bad it was. 

All the political unrest on both sides was fueled by the desperation of mass unemployment. People can hopefully all get back to work soon. 

The vaccination campaign is going way better than my expectation only two months in. It doesn‚Äôt matter if not everyone takes it, remember the only required parameter from the beginning was to stop hospitals getting overloaded. The goalposts keep getting moved but it won‚Äôt matter soon. 

I think that we will all be back to normal by first week of June. Even places like Texas, which may be a little early in removing mask mandates, they‚Äôre not far off from when they should do it anyway, maybe by 3-4 weeks max.

I am ready to stop religiously reading this sub and worldometers daily. It has actually been a good thing for me that the covid tracking project has wrapped up (which feeds APIs for almost every other data source I have been using) so I don‚Äôt check it compulsively anymore. Regardless of what anyone wants or whatever goal they think should be achieved, we‚Äôre in the victory lap and taught all the boomers how to video conference as a bonus.

Yeah I think we're basically going to be at that point soon.

I think one way to do that would be to have a two-track system where the most at-risk groups get access to some dedicated appointment slots or some sort of early access or prioritization, which is kind of what we have now in New York with pharmacies only vaccinating the elderly while other vaccination sites are open to anyone who is eligible. That way you can phase in eligibility for everyone and make it so that you don't need to game the system to get vaccinated, without ending up with people who need it being *completely* unable to get appointments again like in January and early February.

At 12 weeks, you get a booster.   I'm still waiting for you to show me where it says the booster doesn't provide any protection if you provide it outside the window.

This is very simple, but you can't seem to understand it.  I'll talk slowly.

At 3 weeks,  cancer patients in the trial had lower immune response than normal to the first dose.  

At 5 weeks after the first dose, those that had received the 2nd dose  at 21 days saw significant improvement in antibody response.  Those that had not received the 2nd dose, and were still waiting for their 2nd shot (they had not received their booster/2nd shot yet) did not  see an improvement at this time.   It says nothing about whether they will show improvement after they are given the booster at 12 weeks.

\&gt;The results have implications not just for cancer patients but for those around them, as a **three-month period of poor protection** could allow the virus to spread among those caring for the patients, and may even create conditions favouring the emergence of new mutant strains.¬†

That's the current issue, currently the study points to that a SINGLE DOSE does not provide much protection to cancer patients, thus the longer you wait for the second dose, the more time the cancer patients are left vulnerable.   IT DOES NOT say anything about what level of antibody response or efficacy a cancer patient will have after they get the booster at 12 weeks.",,,1615497079,{},gqm8y1h,False,t3_m2tfag,False,True,t1_gqm6w8s,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m2tfag/delaying_second_pfizerbiontech_dose_could_leave/gqm8y1h/,1615501259,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Is there a place that can legitimately compete with YouTube or Facebook right now? The second Palor tried to compete with Twitter it got labeled and deplatformed. So they have the only avenue in their field of social media, and as such, if they are in lockstep with big tech, they can manipulate and dictate what messages are allowed to exist on their platforms. And they will usually go with what is the ""safe"" message to not rock the advertiser and shareholder boats. They don't really care about heath and well being, but how much their bottom lines are. They will go for the popular opinions or what their advertisers want so they get more money.

And in a situation as serious as this one, it is important that ALL experts and ALL scientists are heard out. But if big tech social media platforms are allowed to filter what is or isn't fit for public consumption, it only manipulates the perception to to what those platforms need. How is anyone able to make an informed decision if they are only getting a portion of the experts that have said anything? How can anyone make a fair assessment of the facts and the science when only those scientists that confirm those tech biases are allowed to exist on the platform. It is amplified even more so here on Reddit and on message boards where not only certain scientists and experts are allowed their say, but you also have administrations willing to purge anyone who goes against the approved message, and a mob willing to go after anyone that tries to pierce the echo chamber in any way.  How many articles and studies do you think don't make it past the automod of r/Coronavirus for low quality that might actually help worth looking at? Why do you think that is?

I mean literally having to go to a Rangers game with 40,000 other people. Please show me the huge social importance of that.

It‚Äôs not this one single event. Sure, this one event is meaningless, but are you going to cancel/prevent other similar events? Because once you start doing that, it‚Äôs no longer meaningless. 

&gt;	They would still need their employees. Try to keep up.

So all these stories of stadium employees being unemployed and needing assistance were lies?

&gt;	That is because you aren‚Äôt too bright. I don‚Äôt even need to expound on this. You have just created your own reality here despite me already explaining it.

I‚Äôm not bright because I think not wanting to die has an element of fear? You really don‚Äôt think the average person is at least somewhat fearful of dying?

&gt;	You just don‚Äôt need to take it to some extreme

Since when is adhering to the capacity set taking it to the extreme?

&gt;	It is not me. My idea lines up with recommendations of the scientific community. On the other hand you just decide shit because that is what you want. I think I will go with science. You on the other hand are the one making decisions on acceptable risk. You should ask yourself that question, not me.

If I ask my self that question, the answer is it‚Äôs acceptable until you force others to mitigate it for you while you are able to mitigate it yourself. 

&gt;	You want to be able to do as you please, and that means ignoring the recommendations of our experts. That then requires making up random bullshit to fit your desires.

Close. I want everyone to do what they want without others telling them what to. However, where you‚Äôre completely wrong is that the ‚Äúrandom bullshit‚Äù I state completely supports that point. If I was solely wanting to open the stadium so that I could attend, you might be right that I‚Äôm just making up BS to support that. But I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm starting with the belief that everyone can do what they want and applying that to various situations like baseball games.

I received a job offer for my first post college job at the end of 2019 but it was for a navy contractor so I had to get a security clearance before I could start working. I finished the paperwork in the middle of December 2019 and they told me it would be between 4 and 6 months before everything went through. I decided to just kind of hangout for 4 months since that would be my last 4 months of freedom before I had to start working and my parents were fine with it. 

Fast forward to March and I get an email saying that my security clearance went through and was given a start date for my job. I started to look for apartments in the area and was ready to plan a trip there to sign for an apartment. However the week I was given my start date was the week everything went to shit and shelter in place orders were given and everything got shut down. I received an email saying now everyone's start date's were being pushed back a couple months so that ""they could figure things out and see how the situation developed."" I understood where they were coming from and wasn't actually that sad as everything was super crazy then. 

Fast forward to June and the US response being what it was and I receive another email saying that because of everything many people at the company had put off their retirements or plans to switch jobs/departments and because of that no one who was supposed to start in 2020 could start their jobs in 2020 and would have to wait until some time in 2021. 

I was completely devastated. I was so close to being able to finally move and start my life after going through a complete hell of a job search process and I'd had everything snatched from under me because of something completely out of my control. 

Now it is 2021 and I still do not have a start date. They have started other people but I have to wait until it is ""my turn"" once enough people leave. I have applied to other jobs in this time as I really just want to move the fuck out of my parents house and away from my home town but I have only gotten a couple of interviews that lead no where. Now there is a giant gap on my resume that is a huge red flag to potential employers. I keep sending out resumes because I just want to start working knowing they are probably going to get thrown in the trash. 

I don't know what to do. They have told me that once 3 more people in the department where I am supposed to work leave or retire I can start but I have no idea when that might be. I have been doing nothing for the past year and it has completely killed my mental health. I get pretty upset sometimes reading comments about how other people ""lost a year"" when they still got paid and got professional experience meanwhile I have been at home doing fucking nothing except volunteering at a few places here and there. I lost out of a year of salary and experience and living in a new city and new relationships. I am in my mid twenties so this feels like the worst possible time to be losing a year of that kind of stuff. 

This pandemic won't end for me when I get a vaccine. This pandemic won't end for me when mask mandates are lifted. This pandemic won't end for me when there are full stadiums and music festivals.

My problem with voluntary mask requirements is that it puts the onus on businesses, and thus, the bottom of the totem pole employees to enforce them. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs right. Having it statewide gives them much easier reinforcement than having it be store policy. Best case scenario, the customer asks to speak to their manager, but that‚Äôs not much better. 

Even when Austin tries to keep a mask mandate, the state AG sues them. Small government only when it suits me, I guess, is what the state government of Texas is going for. 

As well, with the mask thing, not wearing a mask puts other people at risk. That simple. We require people to wear seatbelts in the car so they 1. Don‚Äôt kill themselves or 2. Rag doll and kill or seriously injure other passengers. We require to people to not drink and drive, as it increases the chance they crash into and kill someone. We require passengers to wear seatbelts in planes so they don‚Äôt get injured or injure others during severe turbulence. We require small children to be put in child seats so they are safely secured. 

Wearing a mask during a viral pandemic should not be voluntary, it should be mandatory. You are increasing the risk of spreading a respiratory disease through aerosol or respiratory droplets.

[],,Arctic-Soda,,,[],,,,text,t2_6ltzoden,False,False,[],"I was working at Walt Disney World this time last year, participating in the Disney College Program. This was something that I had wanted to do for years, and was finally accepted in 2019 after my 3rd or 4th time applying. This was more-or-less my dream job, which I started back in January of last year on my 21st birthday. I thought 2020 was going to be the best year of my life; it certainly started out that way.

I became aware of COVID-19 sometime in late January, and a bit more in February, definitely a lot more in March, however during my time working at Disney, we were so caught up in the thrill of it all and living in the moment that most of us thought nothing of COVID-19; a lot of us didn't think that it would be anything worth worrying about. Oh how wrong we were, but hindsight is 20/20.

We were having the time of our lives really, I know I certainly was. I am a very introverted person and have a bit of social anxiety, and I was finally beginning to open up and really starting to come to terms with who I was and accept myself for that. I was really enjoying life and didn't want that taken away from me, but obviously the world had different plans.

I first noticed something was very wrong when around late February I started not being able to find toilet paper and certain cleaning supplies at local supermarkets. It became a chore just to find this stuff, and some of us around the Disney housing had to start sharing this stuff because it was getting harder to find. It might seem odd that this was the first thing that caused me to notice that something was up, but a lot of us really weren't keeping up-to-date with what was happening in the world at that time; we were just so caught up in enjoying ourselves that we didn't really think to keep up with the news &amp; current events.

I thought maybe the hoarding of toilet paper and cleaning supplies was just an effect of overreaction from some people, and in hindsight it kind of really was, but around this time last year, we became aware that Walt Disney World would be closing for what they believed at the time would only be for 2 weeks. Those of us who were working there and living in Disney housing weren't sure what that meant for us, and apparently Disney didn't really know either. They only thought they'd be closed for 2 weeks initially, so perhaps they were planning on keeping us around until it had passed. Well it didn't pass, and on March 14th, we learned that Disney would be suspending the college program, and we all had 48 hours to pack up and leave the Disney housing.

Just like that, we all lost our dream jobs and had to scramble to get home, while the world was seemingly collapsing. At this point I knew that things were not going to be the same as they were for quite some time, though I wasn't sure for how long. I so desperately wanted the situation to improve as soon as possible, though this was never realistic. It was very difficult for me to come to terms with the fact that, after finally achieving the happiness I sought for years and finally getting my dream job, that it could all just be ripped away from me before I even really had a chance to appreciate it all, and essentially my 21st year was almost entirely wasted.

On February 25th, I remember one of my Psych professors telling my class to prepare for ‚Äúsome form of quarantine‚Äù, but to be honest the concern didn‚Äôt really resonate with the campus population until March. 

When my university first announced a switch to virtual classes on March 10th starting a few days later, I thought I‚Äôd still be able to come to campus to study in the library (taking precautions of course) and also do lab work.

[],,ma2is,,,[],,,,text,t2_59vcj,False,False,[],"On February 1st 2020 I finally got promoted to a position as fitness manager at our gym. It was a long journey to get there but I was glad to have a stable career now. On the 2nd, one of our top trainers took a mental leave of absence and I was tasked with replacing his 14 hours of weekly training and coaching. It was a very stressful 2 weeks. 

On March 13th the owners sent out a letter stating that the gym would abide by the CDC and close its doors temporarily. They sent out an email to staff to file for un employment immediately as everyone was going to be furloughed. That same night I came down with the worst illness of my adult life (not confirmed if it was COVID or not, who knows). 2 weeks later I was informed that I would actually not be getting furloughed as they needed some help transitioning their fitness to an online model. This made my unemployment situation extremely complicated. 

May came around and I was told I was going to be furloughed once again, this time for good. In the meantime I was working harder than ever trying to sell equipment, run virtual workout classes, and manage training clients who had outstanding sessions. 

The following year has easily been the worst year of my life. I got married December 27th 2019, and had a honeymoon planned for Paris in September of 2020. No big deal, we can travel later. The problem we dealt with was my MIL‚Äôs cancer diagnosis. She was scheduled for chemo from January 2020 - July 2020, and in the middle of the pandemic she was forced to recover alone. The stress and worry my wife has been dealing with will inevitably effect her for the rest of her life. In September she was considered in remission and we could finally breathe a sigh of relief. We ended up having an outdoor thanksgiving and had planned an outdoor Christmas as well. 

On December 26th, just 1 day before our anniversary, her cancer came back. She‚Äôs still getting chemo today, but we are just counting down the days until we can give her a hug again. 

I‚Äôve generally had a positive outlook on life. 2020 has shattered it. I‚Äôve never been so disappointed in the leadership of our government. I‚Äôm disgusted by the actions of selfish people who‚Äôs kept the pandemic worse than it needed to be. I‚Äôm exhausted from arguing with antimaskers and antivaxers. I‚Äôm tired of hearing how hard life is without being able to go to their favorite restaurant. I‚Äôm disturbed by the general populations lack of empathy and their narcissism. 

2021 is going much better. My wife and I just got our first dose, and we will soon be able to care for my MIL as she prepares to sell her house and move in with us. I took up a job as a part time instructor and I love it. My wife has an interview for her dream job and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. The scar left from 2020 will always remind me that life is much more precious and fragile than we could ever imagine.

[],,Collaterlie_Sisters,,,[],,,,text,t2_46lou,False,False,[],"A year ago I remember watching the presser and taking transcripts for the Discord group. It already seemed like a saga by that point, and I honestly was worried about us getting properly locked down, as in unable to leave the house for groceries. We had a fully stocked storeroom of food, and a lot of masks.

It's been a year since then - woah. I don't even know where to begin with what the last year has taught me. My friendships, for the most part, have actually strengthened. We've opened up to each other in recent months about how much we miss each other, and we're not usually a very emotional bunch. We've rallied around for friends who have been sick or gone though shit. We've spend deep, meaningful time on calls, and found new ways to enjoy the friendship through online games. 

Early on, my cousin started a trivia zoom call once a week. My whole family are back in the UK and it's really helped me mentally, being able to hang out and chat, be part of 'in jokes' again, and show them a part of my life over video. My dad was actually about to fly out and see me, and a week before he was due to come, they shut down international travel. So it's been amazing to have that. In addition, my mother in law started up a weekly games night (mahjongg!) and we've not missed a week since last Summer. So because of the pandemic, I've got closer with both sides of my family, and I am so grateful for that.

I've realized that I am not as independent as I think I am. My husband had to fly somewhere for a couple of weeks, and honestly I started to notice signs of depression in myself towards the end of my time home alone. I work virtually, and I really don't do anything that requires human interaction, so while I enjoyed room to sing loudly, bake and make a mess, and hog the big TV, all I wanted was some background noise caused by another human or something. I have a bubble with my best friend, and she hung out a few times, and that was really really nice. Yeah, in the last year I've confronted the fact that I like having people around, and maybe I need to lean on people once in a while.

My interests have expanded - gardening, making music, mahjongg, baking, redecorating, working out, playing VR games... I've kept pretty busy this whole time, which has been good. 

Man, I've missed restaurants! Bars, ehhh I can cope with the lack of a bar in my social life, but I miss with all my heart the ability to say fuck it and go overspend on some indulgent meal. We bought our house because it was in walking distance to a set of nice bars and restaurants, and I'm really anxious to get back to going out on a Friday night and perusing a menu of delights. Being able to just point at a meal and have someone bring it over to you (for $$$ lol). No washing up. Getting tipsy over a bottle of wine, and stumbling back home.

The warm times have been easier than the cold times. I do stand up paddleboarding, which is certainly a warm weather hobby. I love doing BBQ and sunbathing on the deck. This house gets really cold, and while we have a home gym, it's SO COLD in there in the winter.

Talking of which, fitness - I know it's been different for everyone, some people found that the pandemic made them eat more and drop a lot of activities that kept them physically active, but I had the opposite effect. Having to cook at home, and having a pantry full of canned food, meant we'd do a lot of healthy stews and things I could put in the slow cooker. We've ordered takeout a couple of times, but mostly our diet has been good. I don't go in stores anymore because I do curbside, so I can resist the urge to buy stupid stuff I don't need. And then there's the home gym, which is right through the doors by our living room, so it's constantly shaming me if I've been lazy. I've stayed the same weight, but put on muscle from lifting and running. 

So, all in all, I've got more positives from this than I though, but holy fucking shit am I ready for it to be over.",,,1615490332,{},gqltnpg,False,t3_m2k60w,False,True,t3_m2k60w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m2k60w/the_yearlong_reflection/gqltnpg/,1615493519,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

My birthday last year was the day before everything changed. We ate at a restaurant and they wiped down the menus. The next day I watched the news in awe as things started getting cancelled and things began to shut down. That weekend we went to pick up my present, my bowling ball. The man who helped me was super nice and we didn't know yet that physical distancing was about to become a thing as we checked the fit. We used hand¬†sanitizer, and opened the doors with a tissue. I had already been using tissues to open doors when I was working in schools for a week. We ran back to the car in the rain, drove home, and shut our door.¬†One day I'll get to use my bowling ball for the first time. Sometimes I get it out and hold it for a wild Friday night. 

I'm a voice actor. I received a script to record that was for a training video for use in hospitals. It talked about procedures for when the focus needed to shift from providing each person the best care to providing the best care for the most people. It was dark. I also voiced a stay strong and stay home type PSA. I recorded a bunch of phone prompts for events that I knew wouldn't happen, and cheerfully talked about heading into ""the best Spring season ever!!"" Hm. Right. My spouse and kid and I made a couple funny parody videos. A Paula Cole nod, ""Where Has All the TP Gone"" and ""Vaccinated"" (I Wanna Be Sedated) They're in my post history if you're interested. We had a fucking blast with it and I'll remember that forever. It was great to give some smiles. 

I wonder if people think we're weirdos for how strict we've been. I wonder if other people have done things like we have. We get our groceries using curbside pick up. My kid does school online, and my work life shifted to account for that.  We get delivery from restaurants. I once sputtered ""I need to stay away!"" at a maskless person who was quickly approaching me as I unloaded groceries, then I went inside and cried out of embarrassment and sadness for our circumstances.¬†That's a funny story now. 

Whenever I feel sorry for myself or down about my pandemic reality, it leads me to think of how utterly privileged my reality is. Then I feel guilty for having such audacity. I'm trying to be easy on myself and give validation to the mental load as well as the physical one that I don't have to face, but really. When people don't have enough food for their family and have no choice but to take risks they would rather not take to live, how dare I? I castigate myself. I should stop doing that.¬†

I wrote an entire album in a flurry of inspiration that lasted a few months. I'd had writer's block for a long time, and this experience opened some kind of door in me. Months out from those months of inspiration, pandemic fatigue has helped close that door again, and I hope I can get it back open again soon. I wrote in one song ""There's a cloud that I'll need to step out of to face the sun."" I am very much feeling that right now. I have anxiety over reemerging. A year out, and I'm fully vaccinated. I went to CVS just now. It was the first building I've been in in a year, except for the vet's office when we had to put down our sweet kitty  back in the summer. It was WEIRD. I am WEIRD. I did jazz hands at the pharmacist. I felt chatty, and I'm not one for small talk.

I think the Texas Rangers announcing 100% capacity is a very good example for the mindset we're all facing right now. Personally, I think 100% capacity is a bit much this early. I think starting with 50% or even 75% with plans to increase to 100% is more realistic and smarter. BUT... therein lies the problem. What happens when numbers decrease further but still aren't to all our liking in a few months? Do we think 100% capacity is too much and push the goal posts back more?

There's an error in setting a goal and saying ""once we hit X, we'll do y."" Because you spend all this time pushing for X, then you get to X and X is no longer good enough.

1. Many other vaccines reduce transmission hence the whole concept of ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù.

2. People who have recovered from a case of COVID-19 very rarely test positive again (and we knew this from studies of healthcare workers who are routinely tested regardless of symptoms) so it‚Äôs not like we had any reason to believe immunity to this virus would only prevent sickness.

3. Moderna/Pfizer produce immune response at least as strong as people who have recovered from Covid-19 and prevent a whopping 95% of symptomatic cases so it seemed likely they would prevent some asymptomatic ones too.

4. We‚Äôve long known from contact tracing that people who are fully asymptomatic and never go on to develop symptoms don‚Äôt spread the virus as often as others due to lower viral loads and shorter infectious periods.

I may not be an epidemiologist but I have read a lot of studies about this virus and pointed these things out here months ago along with many other people. I think the messaging should have been ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know how reliably vaccines will prevent transmission, but it is likely to reduce the likelihood to some extent‚Äù. 

All the pushing of the idea that vaccines don‚Äôt prevent transmission in the beginning and even after we started getting some better evidence from Israel (the dozens of strongly worded articles about how little vaccinated people can do came off much more like they don‚Äôt prevent transmission than we‚Äôre not sure) have been unnecessarily keeping vaccinated people isolated and encouraging vaccine hesitancy.",,,1615473834,{},gqks2vn,False,t3_m2peb9,False,True,t1_gqklq5y,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m2peb9/pfizerbiontech_say_covid19_vaccine_likely_to/gqks2vn/,1615473894,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Putin doesn't have to care if a few thousand Russians die so he can buy influence in the Middle East and Latin America. In the US I suspect even Democrats would be willing to impeach Biden if he started giving away vaccines even before seniors and teachers were vaccinated. 

And just from a public health perspective, it doesn't make any sense for one of the hardest hit countries to be giving away vaccines.

**Use of the AstraZeneca¬†Covid-19 vaccine has been suspended in six European countries over blood clot fears.**

Austria‚Äôs national medicines regulator has suspended use of a batch of the AstraZeneca vaccine after four patients were diagnosed with dangerous blood clotting conditions after receiving their jab.

One person died of multiple thrombosis ‚Äì formation of blood clots within blood vessels ‚Äì 10 days after their vaccine, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said.

A second patient was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism ‚Äì where blockages form in the arteries in the lungs ‚Äì but is now recovering.

Now, Denmark has also suspended the use of the vaccine the director of the Danish Health Authority, Soren Brostrom, confirmed in a statement.

He said: ""Both we and the Danish Medicines Agency have to respond to reports of possible serious side-effects, both from Denmark and other European countries.‚Äù

Mt Brostrom stressed that at this stage Denmark has not opted out of using the vaccine.

""It is important to emphasise that we have not opted out of using the¬†AstraZeneca¬†vaccine, but that we are putting it on hold,"" he said.

The health agency said the vaccine would be suspended for 14 days.

 

The EMA said there is currently no evidence that the vaccine caused the conditions, and that thrombosis is not listed as a potential side effect of the vaccine.

It said that the batch labelled ABV5300 comprised one million doses and had been delivered to 17 EU countries.

Four other countries ‚Äì Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia ‚Äì have now suspended its use to allow time for the EMA‚Äôs Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) to conduct an investigation.

AstraZeneca told [**The Telegraph**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/11/denmark-suspends-use-astrazeneca-vaccine-blood-clot-fears/) vaccien shots are subject to strict and rigorous quality checks.

They said there have been ""no confirmed serious adverse events associated with the vaccine"".

The EMA said: ‚ÄúAlthough a quality defect is considered unlikely at this stage, the batch quality is being investigated.‚Äù

It said PRAC were investigating the thrombosis conditions linked to the same batch as well as all other reports of thrombosis and related blood clotting conditions reported post-vaccination.

‚ÄúThe information available so far indicates that the number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than that seen in the general population,‚Äù it said.

The EMA said as of Tuesday, there had been 22 reports of such conditions among the three million people to receive the AstraZeneca jab in the European Economic Area.

It said further information would be released as the investigation progresses.",,,1615473483,{},gqkrczo,False,t3_m2ob6x,False,True,t3_m2ob6x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m2ob6x/six_european_countries_suspend_use_of_astrazeneca/gqkrczo/,1615473528,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

From March -&gt; April, a bit of hopelessness set in, as we didn't know when it will all end.  Around late April/May, things started to open up, gatherings were reduced, and we remained outside during those gatherings.

Take out became big (for me), but I also started cooking/baking more.  Homemade pizza?  Got it!  My kitchen tools were also not great, so I learned how to sharpen my knife, and eventually also bought a newer one.  Few more pots and pans (dutch oven FTW), some upgrades on ingredients, etc -- all from the lock down.  My budget heavily went to kitchen gear vs. clothing!

Summer -&gt; Fall was mostly better: more places were open, gatherings would remain outside (mostly).  Once November started, I knew we'd be back in lock down, as everyone were in stores gearing up for big family gatherings.  Even if people weren't planning on big Thanksgiving meals, there wasn't any way covid wasn't spreading with the overall activity in shops/grocery/etc.

A year later, the ""end"" of it all is a little more clear, but not exact.  Vaccinations will clearly play a role in gaining the necessary herd immunity, and this will just take time.  Even if the manufacturers could Thanos snap their fingers to produce enough immediately, logistics of delivery and actual pokes will take a bit of time.

In the morning, nothing had been cancelled yet. My first period class talked about whether we thought school would be cancelled, and my teacher said there was no way school would be cancelled for an extended period of time because we had absolutely no plan for how to conduct online learning.

The person sitting next to me joked that if we were all on our phones in this class, the world must really be ending. 

Around 1pm, everyone got an email saying that all extracurricular clubs were cancelled (but not sports). We were supposed to have a track meet that afternoon, and our coach emailed us saying not to freak out because the meet was still happening. I was sitting with some friends from track at lunch and we all rolled our eyes. Sure enough, half an hour later, we got another email saying the meet was cancelled and that we should meet in the gym after school.

During my last period class, we were supposed to be working on a project, but no one could focus. Our governor made an announcement about coronavirus during that time, so our teacher showed his video on the screen during class. People in my class were saying that they heard sports had been cancelled for a whole month.

I remember going to the bathroom during that class and seeing someone from my first period class in the hallway, and we both looked at each other and shouted ""What is going on"" at the same time because it felt like so much had changed from just a few hours ago. Everything just felt surreal. 

After school, every single sport crammed into the gym. It was weird because the none of the coaches had any idea what was going on and they were all saying different things. I think I heard the word ""unprecedented"" more on that day than every before. Walking out of that gym felt so anticlimactic; I was supposed to feel adrenaline and butterflies in my stomach before running my race, but instead I felt a kind of nervousness that felt deeper than butterflies and wouldn't just go away when the race started.

With all sports and extracurriculars cancelled, we all knew school would be cancelled soon. That night, my school emailed us saying that tomorrow, Friday, March 13, would be our last day in school and attendance would be optional, and then we'd start ""spring break"" early and have an extra week before switching to remote learning for an indefinite amount of time.

 One of my teachers emailed us a rather angry email saying that this wasn't an excuse to miss the exam tomorrow, but I couldn't even bring myself to study. That Friday was crazy too, but that's another story...",,,1615473280,{},gqkqyjg,False,t3_m2k60w,False,True,t3_m2k60w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m2k60w/the_yearlong_reflection/gqkqyjg/,1615473327,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;The case reports of persistent coronavirus in immunocompromised patients are eerily similar despite involving different underlying conditions, geographic locations, genders and ages. They include a man in his 70s in London with B cell lymphoma who experienced large shifts in the virus in his body after getting convalescent plasma therapy and died on Day 102; a 73-year-old man seen at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, who had multiple myeloma and died on Day 74; a 45-year-old man in Boston with a disorder in which the immune system mistakenly attacks normal proteins in the blood who died on Day 154; a woman in her 70s in Munich with follicular lymphoma who died on Day 156; a 60-year-old man in Ann Arbor, Mich., with a different type of lymphoma who on Day 156 left the hospital for home hospice.

&gt;There are also studies involving an adult with HIV, and of a child and a 21-year-old with leukemia who also were observed to have prolonged infection with mutating virus.

...

&gt;In Boston, for example, one patient who was treated at Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital over the summer developed both the B.1.1.7 variant, as well B. 1.351, which been found to be ‚Äúmarkedly more resistant‚Äù to neutralization by convalescent plasma and vaccines, according to a paper published in Nature this month.

Vaccine induced immunity is [comparable to](https://www.verywellhealth.com/antibodies-from-vaccines-and-from-natural-infection-5092564), or [better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l5whhu/increased_resistance_of_sarscov2_variants_b1351/) immunity from a previous infection.

It's too soon to say ""lifelong"" but [that is a possibility.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4nkco/the_immune_system_mounts_a_lasting_defense_after/) Also, it looks like those who have recovered *may* only need [one dose of an mRNA vaccine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/labst4/robust_spike_antibody_responses_and_increased/). There are some people (~7%) who don't develop lasting immunity from infections, but it's not clear to me now whether vaccines would develop lasting immunity for these people.

[Seriously,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4pnde/mrna1273_vaccine_induces_neutralizing_antibodies/) it's [very probably](https://reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l6vs1t/in_vitro_studies_demonstrate_pfizer_and/), like, [not going to be a problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l0yqe6/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gjwov3s?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) Yes, even the SA variant, [which might not be a concern at all.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kxkrb9/endemic_sarscov2_will_maintain_postpandemic/) The more vaccines we test, the more we find that they still [work against the variants](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lax5wa/neutralization_of_sarscov2_voc_501yv2_by_human/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), at least enough to be totally worthwhile. 

ChAdOx1 (Oxford/Astrazeneca) may not be so great against the SA variant, and we have a lot to learn here.  Novavax's vaccine also may have issues with the SA variant, though it doesn't seem that they're as big as with ChAdOx1. [This was encouraging,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmp5doo/) regarding the efficacy of vaccines against variants.

Pfizer [seems fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lf7uph/neutralization_of_viruses_with_european_south/) against the troubling variants, at least in the lab. At the very least, the mRNA vaccines [*still* work](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfp89k/neutralization_of_sarscov2_spike_6970_deletion/) on the three most worrying variants.

Still worried about variants? Check [this out!](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/01/27/vaccination-against-the-new-variants-real-world-data) *

Most variants aren't great at being viruses.  Some, including [that one mink variant,](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/19/danish-covid-mink-variant-very-likely-extinct-but-controversial-cull-continues) have already gone extinct. I think there are other Mink variants that have made it into wild Mink populations, but that doesn't mean that it's definitely going to stay in Mink forever (it might, though).

Antibodies from recovered people who then got an mRNA vaccine [work on variants *and* OG SARS?!](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfiypu/antibodies_elicited_by_sarscov2_infection_and/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) This should really put the variant fear behind us.

**Vaccines Seem to Reduce Spread**

Vaccination and previous infection[ reduce viral load, which reduces spread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s).

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) * article does a good job of explaining the likelihood of vaccines *at least* reducing spread.  [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lf744r/daily_discussion_thread_february_08_2021/gml0gyi/) may help if that article is too much. 

[""Moderna vaccine blocks &gt;90% (87-93%) of infections &amp; 91% (89-94%) of transmission.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmqfk4q/)

Milder cases, especially asymptomatic cases [are worse at spreading](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kcy2e0/weekly_question_thread_week_of_december_14/gg8tp7n/).  

[Pfizer's vaccine may prevent spread and disease.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/loljxz/effectiveness_results_of_the_pfizer_covid19/) Looks like the amount of virus in people who've gotten one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and then infected is [greatly reduced compared to those not vaccinated](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfiqma/decreased_sarscov2_viral_load_following/).  This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a great reduction in ability to spread the virus. [Maybe even with just one dose!](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242) 

Reinfections are rare, some studies show [less than 1 in 1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kyj0bx/sarscov2_reinfection_in_a_cohort_of_43000/) (maybe in the 1 in 10,000 range, you'll have to read the study, it's awesome).  Reinfections tend to be much milder than previous infections, even those new variants. Check the [comments here](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lm0mc2/prior_covid19_significantly_reduces_the_risk_of/) for some really interesting discussion regarding reinfection.

Any answer you get that is either ""yes"" or ""no"" is wrong, for now. We have only ""maybe, probably not"", and it's going to be that way for a long time.

Challenge studies with monkeys and the results look [*really good.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03041-6) They show strong immunity, or [sterilizing immunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/la4fud/immunogenic_bnt162b_vaccines_protect_rhesus/) from multiple vaccine types.  We're still figuring out if and how much sterilizing immunity can be expected from the current vaccines, though it's starting to look really good.

Also, you'll notice that any reputable person talking about this subject always says ""may be able to spread"", or ""maybe"", or ""we don't know if"". And that's because there is a small chance that vaccinated people will be able to spread the virus. But it's not a big chance. Doctors, scientists, and regulators are being very careful with their language on this subject, some would argue they're being too careful. That said, if they were to say that ""vaccinated people cannot spread the virus"", and then we find out that in some situations that vaccinated people have spread the virus, [that would end up worse for them than if they hedge for a while.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/los8r9/daily_discussion_thread_february_21_2021/goa8cu0/) So at least to me, the way they're framing it seems pretty reasonable, you just have to put yourself in their shoes.

That said, they seem to be [saying what I've been saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s). 

**Additional Thoughts/Cool Stuff**

Testing and the Positivity Rate: It's been said a lot in other subs that the positivity rate should go up over time as more people are vaccinated and don't require testing. Last year, it was *the* metric to watch, but it will likely wane quickly in importance as overall testing drops.  Don't necessarily worry about sudden high positivity rates, as mass testing will likely drop off pretty quickly, particularly as testing sites are converted to vaccination sites. 

We may want to use our newly found testing and sequencing capacity to test and sequence a higher proportion of flu samples.  This might give us a head start on which flu genetics are circulating, and help eliminate a flu or two.  We're in the single digits of flu cases most places, which is awesome!

Just because [mRNA vaccines aren't 100% effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/)  against the SA variant, *doesn't* [mean that we'll definitely need boosters](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gmu581s/).

I like [thegracefuldork's prediction about vaccine availability](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lcatpp/daily_discussion_thread_february_04_2021/gm0bwc8/) more than my own previous prediction.  Not because it's ""rosier"", but because it's just better.

**Which vaccine should I get?**

When someone asks me what my favorite beer is, the answer is always the same.

It's the one in front of me.

So get the first vaccine you can, the differences are pretty minor.


[**Conclusions**](https://gfycat.com/cleantalkativedassie)

Okay, so the vaccines reduce infections, and if someone gets an infection after getting vaccinated, they have fewer and reduced symptoms.  This currently seems to also be true with post vaccination infection with any of the known variants. We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with mild symptoms spread only slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well. 

In other words: A reduction in symptoms is at least correlated with a reduction in the ability to spread the virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections and symptoms in those who do get infected. Therefore, vaccines should reduce spread.

This usually involves splicing and rearranging the DNA (which contains unused regions, dividers, stop signals, etc) to produce the final mRNA to make the protein, but if there'a an error in *this* process, the protein can still come out ""wrong"" (i.e. it promotes or fails to suppress the cancer). It looks like the study found in some cancers, the errors were occurring in this stage, rather than being present from the start in the DNA. Needlessly to say this doesn't have anything to do with the mRNA in a vaccine, which is not supposed to produce any protein that the cell needs.

I am the one making the point, remember?  None of what you have said counters my point.  You are the one trotting out the straw man.

The simple fact is we as a society know that drunk driving is harmful, and we do not see it as ok.  We have laws against it in order to protect people from it.  We do not say ""hey, if you don't like drunk drivers stay home.""  We do all we can to mitigate the risk, and the same thing should be done with COVID.  We don't leave those things up to an individual's choice.  It is completely irresponsible to say ""hey, you don't like my behavior despite the fact it puts people's lives in danger, tough shit, stay at home.""  That same statement works for both drunk driving and ignoring COVID preventions.

We, as a society, have deemed many activities as reprehensible because they put the lives of others in danger.  So the whole idea of ""if you don't like it stay home"" is asinine, self centered, and should not be accepted in a decent society.

As Industry Commissioner Thierry Breton said yesterday, it's d√©j√† vu. First Pfizer, then Astrazeneca and even Moderna, and now Janssen (Johnson&amp;Johnson). But are ""untrue rumors"" those according to which there will be delivery problems for the anti-Covid vaccine of Janssen, pharmaceutical division of the American Johnson &amp; Johnson, for which is expected tomorrow the green light of the European Medicines Agency Ema. Loredana Bergamini, medical director of Janssen Italy, in an interview with Corriere della Sera, states, as did the company in a statement yesterday, that everyone is doing their best to respect the contracts. As had been assured in the press release that at the end of January listed the data of phase 3 of the single dose viral vector compound that for Italy will mean 52 million doses throughout 2021 according to the vaccine plan.

""We are working rigorously on logistics to get the lots where and when they need to be delivered - ensures Bergamini - Our production schedule will allow us to meet the commitment of 200 million doses for the EU in 2021. By the end of March we will have a more precise picture of the supply schedule and we are in close contact with the Commission and Member States to define a more precise, regular and transparent delivery schedule. We expect the first batches to be available for the EU in the second quarter. We will distribute these volumes equally among all countries."" Janssen also recently signed an agreement with French giant Sanofi specifically so that the competitor's plants can produce up to 12 million doses per month. In a statement, the French pharmaceutical company announced that it will take over formulation and filling of bottles at its Marcy-l'Etoile site, near Lyon, ""starting in the third quarter"" of 2021 and ""at a rate of approximately 12 million doses per month.""

The incoming vaccine, recalls the medical director of Janssen Italy, ""is the only single-dose one to have completed phase 3 testing, the conclusive one. It is built on a platform for which we have an exclusive patent called AdVac, which uses a cold adenovirus, engineered so that it is rendered inactive and unable to infect. Inside it is inserted a genetic information, that of the Spike protein that Sars Cov 2 uses to penetrate the human cell. Once inoculated, the cells read this information and stimulate the production of specific antibodies capable of responding to the coronavirus"".

""Janssen's preparation - Bergamini recalls - prevents in 85% of cases the most frightening forms of Covid that require hospitalization, and in 100% of cases it avoids death. So it has a very strong protection. From day 7, antibody protection begins. By day 28 it is 85%. In our experimental study, we tested 15,000 people of all ages, starting at age 18 and over 60. 41% of the volunteers enrolled had one or more chronic diseases: obesity, hypertension, diabetes, severe cardiovascular disease. All responded well. A study of under 18s and children is about to start."" As for the unknown variants, ""the vaccine has been tested in South Africa and Brazil where variants were already circulating and it worked"". And storage? ""Doses can be kept for 2 years at -20 degrees,"" while ""once thawed they can remain at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees for 3 months.""

2,349 deaths from covid in 24 hours: Brazil surpasses 2,000 deaths for the first time - 03/10/2021 - UOL News

2.349. For the first time in the entire pandemic, Brazil recorded more than 2,000 new deaths caused by covid-19 in a 24-hour interval. And this was not the only scary number on Wednesday (10) of sad brands for the country. For the 12th day in a row, we presented a record average of deaths: 1,645 in the last seven days. The country also surpassed the 270,000 dead in the pandemic.

The survey is from the consortium of media outlets of which UOL is a part, based on data provided by state health departments. And the record number does not account for data from the Federal District, which has not released the update in the last 24 hours.

This is the ninth consecutive day with more than a thousand deaths computed across the country in a 24-hour interval, the longest sequence in the entire pandemic. In total, there have been 270,917 victims since March 2020.

According to data from Johns Hopkins University, a world reference in covid-19 studies, Brazil is the second country with the highest number of deaths caused by the disease. We are second only to the United States, which has a total of 528,603 victims, according to a survey released this afternoon.

Of the five days with the highest number of victims in the entire pandemic, all occurred in March and within a week (the figures do not indicate when the deaths actually occurred, but when they started counting from the official balance sheets):

March 10 - 2,349
March 9 - 1954
March 3 - 1,840
March 4 - 1,786
March 5 - 1,760
Eight states have computed more than 100 covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours. The total number of victims in these states alone reaches 1,765:

S√£o Paulo - 469
Goi√°s - 267
Rio Grande do Sul - 250
Paran√° - 243
Minas Gerais - 219
Bahia - 111
Santa Catarina - 107
Cear√° - 105
Record behind record

For the 49th day in a row, Brazil has a moving average of covid-19 deaths of more than 1,000, this being the longest period in the entire pandemic. Successive records consolidate an even more lethal second wave than the first. The country has become a ""global threat"" in the view of foreign media, and sees several states facing a chaotic situation in their health systems.

In the first wave:

Highest number of deaths in 24 hours: 1,554 (19/7)
Highest moving average of deaths: 1,097 (25/7)
Largest period with an average above a thousand: 31 days
Highest number of deaths in a week: 7,679 (from 7/19 to 7/25)
In the second wave:

Highest number of deaths in 24 hours: 2,349 (10/3)
Highest moving average of deaths: 1,645 (10/3)
Largest period with an average of over a thousand: 49 days
Highest number of deaths in a week: 10,183 (from 28/2 to 6/3)
The 15 highest moving averages of covid-19 deaths in Brazil were verified in the last 15 days. The top ten are as follows:

March 10 -1,645
March 9 - 1,572
March 8 - 1,540
March 7 - 1,497
March 6 - 1,455
March 5 - 1,423
March 4 - 1,361
March 3 - 1,332
March 2 - 1,274
March 1 - 1,223
In the last 24 hours, there have been 80,955 confirmed cases of covid-19 in Brazil - the second largest mark in the entire pandemic. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the total number of infected has risen to 11,205,972.

Health Data

Also, infection is how we reached herd immunity before we developed vaccines, so while the vaccines are good news for many, infections still can get us to herd immunity. Not saying anything about whether they should but I am saying that it's possible.

And you act as if people who are unvaccinated are going to be constantly infectious. No one should be banned from anywhere.

We were talking about Covid-19. I was one of those people who thought it was going to go away by the summer. And I thought since I am a 19 year old who is healthy, I would be basically immune to the virus. 

Then came the executive stat at home order for Illinois. No more school in person. It was very strange. I remember hearing all of the news about the shortages of toilet paper and how the stock market crashed. That part was scary because I just didn't know what would happen. At the beginning of the lockdown, it wasn't all that bad. No school still since they have to scramble to adjust to online classes. I got to play videogames during the day with my friends, and then at night and on the weekends I continued to go to work because I worked at a restaurant. 

Once school got back in session. I hated it, I couldn't pay attention and I didn't want to be there. I was more worried about work and just relaxing because I thought everything would be back to normal by next semester. Last summer was okay. I still got to see friends here and there. Mask wearing wasn't too big of a deal for me. I just had to get used to the feeling of something covering my mouth and nose. Work was amazing because we were still getting a lot of take out and delivery orders. The tips I made during this time were insane. And by the middle of summer, the dinning room was opened again! It was looking good!

Then I got the message that school was still going to be remote. I was really bummed out about that because I really thought it could have happened. In September I remember cases in my area started to increase. My grandma passed away at this time too, not because of Covid. And then like a few weeks later I got Covid-19. It was only a mild case. This was really the lowest point of last year for me. I felt depressed like I never did before. The only thing that kept me stable was work, I was able to keep my mind off of things when I went back. 

The fall and winter were mostly miserable. I hated the fact that I couldn't celebrate Thanksgiving and Christmas with my family and loved ones. I missed them so much. School was boring and I wasn't learning anything. But it was such a relief once the news of the vaccines came out. I knew right then and there we have a chance of hope that things can return to normal again. 

And by the beginning of 2021 I leaned on the hope of the vaccines to be effective. And I was hoping with spring coming and the warmer weather, cases would start to fall. And where we are now, it's just amazing and incredible! 

My final reflections on this pandemic are that I wish myself and others would have taken this more seriously from the beginning. It could have really helped to prevent a lot of deaths. If I were to tell myself a year ago that over 500,000 Americans are going to die from the virus. I would have thought I was insane. I want to thank all the healthcare workers for fighting on the front lines of this pandemic, and to my fellow essential workers that continue to work through this pandemic, thank you for being there for others! Things are looking great for this summer! Just continue to wear your mask, practice social distancing, and when it's your turn to get the vaccine, do it!!! Trust science!!

I told my father at dinner on March 8 that COVID ""would be the biggest thing to happen to our lives since 9/11.""

Since then, I'd consider myself lucky. My area of the US knocked COVID down enough that we had an OK summer. I got to swim every day, traveled to the beach with my immediate family (risky but worth it).

The next 2 days the college campus was a ghost town for those of us who chose to not come in, especially those people from Montgomery County who heard of 1st cases there a bit earlier than Philly's 1st positive on the 10th. My last class was on the 12th and last day of work was the 13th. I was snapping screenshots &amp; newspaper front pages in these days last year, so it is crazy looking back on it now. An uncle of mine gave me my 1st few face masks on the 17th. I ordered more online the same day but they didn't show up until early April. Never went out without a mask after 17 March 2020 day so far. There was a lot of confusion early on &amp; a lot of us weren't sure if we could catch the virus from packages/delivery, if 6 ft/2 m was really far enough away to be from people when shopping, etc. Those of us from the college didn't know how the rest of the semester was going to go &amp; some of us who worked there didn't know if we were going to be laid off temporarily or what. Earlier in the week the college announced closure for just 2 days (16 &amp; 17 March), then on the 13th after many professors wrote to the president of the college about how serious the situation was in other countries &amp; what other universities were doing by then, they announced a 2-week closure via e-mail at about 15:45 EDT. Us tutors got an announcement that we will be paid the entire closure time as if we were still working, at the average number of hours across the entire department. My final ride on public transport since the pandemic began was also that day. IIRC, Philadelphia K12 schools closed at the end of business on Friday the 13th, too. The next 2 weeks were a strange limbo time of anxiety about the virus but also not really knowing what was coming next in our day to day life as Zoom classes didn't start till the 31st and tutoring was going to be by an ad-hoc Google spreadsheet they designed up to get us through the end of the semester starting the same day. It was a strange time to not really have anything at all on the calendar. My Swarm app would say 'Stay Home!' when I would check-in to the 1 or 2 places I still had to go for groceries every now &amp; then. Eventually it was announced all classes &amp; tutoring will be online for the summer semesters, then on 26 May they announced the same for autumn 2020, then on 15 September the same regarding spring 2021 classes. Looking back it was surreal to see how fast everything changed. The main thing I wonder now that we do have vaccines going out is life beyond COVID-19. Like will work-from-home stick around for those who want to remain this way? Will work-from-home transition to work-from-anywhere? Will vaccine passports becomes a thing even for local/domestic life? How will anxiety be handled for the non-zero number of people who will feel scared around crowds even after COVID-19 is no longer a major threat?

The company that I was working for at the time announced that we would be working from home for at least the next month, although there were rumors that it would be at least a few months (that seemed so inconceivable at the time). It was at this point that I knew we were completely fucked. Despite the whole ""just two weeks to flatten the curve"" with the impression being given that things would go back to normal afterwords, along with people on this sub and other platforms assuring that in a few months time, life would go back to normal, I KNEW we were totally fucked and that it would be at least a year until we would be ""through this.""

I'm ecstatic that we are so close to being ""normal again."" with the weather warming up and vaccination numbers exploding all over the country, I feel a sense of hope and optimism that I haven't felt in what feels like many years. Such a sharp contrast to the gloom, hopelessness and uncertainty that I felt a year ago.

&gt; ‚ÄúGovernors‚Äô party affiliation may have contributed to a range of policy decisions that, together, influenced the spread of the virus,‚Äù says study senior author Sara Benjamin-Neelon, PhD, professor in the Bloomberg School‚Äôs Department of Health, Behavior and Society. ‚ÄúThese findings underscore the need for state policy actions that are guided by public health considerations rather than by partisan politics.‚Äù

&gt;**Methods:** A longitudinal analysis was conducted in December 2020 examining COVID-19 incidence, death, testing, and test positivity rates from March 15 through December 15, 2020. A Bayesian negative binomial model was fit to estimate daily RRs and posterior intervals (PIs) comparing rates by gubernatorial party affiliation. The analyses adjusted for state population density, rurality, Census region, age, race, ethnicity, poverty, number of physicians, obesity, cardiovascular disease, asthma, smoking, and presidential voting in 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Results:** From March to early June, Republican-led states had lower COVID-19 incidence rates compared with Democratic-led states. On June 3, the association reversed, and Republican-led states had higher incidence (RR=1.10, 95% PI=1.01, 1.18). This trend persisted through early December. For death rates, Republican-led states had lower rates early in the pandemic, but higher rates from July 4 (RR=1.18, 95% PI=1.02, 1.31) through mid-December. Republican-led states had higher test positivity rates starting on May 30 (RR=1.70, 95% PI=1.66, 1.73) and lower testing rates by September 30 (RR=0.95, 95% PI=0.90, 0.98).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Conclusion:** Gubernatorial party affiliation may drive policy decisions that impact COVID-19 infections and deaths across the U.S. Future policy decisions should be guided by public health considerations rather than political ideology.",,,1615482718,{},gqlbur4,True,t3_m2ul9o,False,True,t3_m2ul9o,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m2ul9o/as_cases_spread_across_us_last_year_pattern/gqlbur4/,1615484184,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I'm sure I will see them again but it's been over a year. 

March 10th was kind of a normal day at home but I kept thinking this is all bullshit people are all freaking out for nothing. A lot of my friends even went to Disney World and lived a normal spring break. I stayed home and hung at home.

March 11th was scary. Harvard canceled school for the whole year. March Madness was without fans. That evening was my coronavirus ""pearl harbor event"". When President Trump went on TV and banned travel to Europe I was like oh shit. I opened twitter the NBA season was indefinitely suspended and then to finish off the vicious 1-2-3 combo of news Tom Hanks tested positive in Queensland, Australia.

The next day I woke up somberly. As a sports fan each season was dropping like flies, NHL, MLB and then the big one fell. March madness a multibillion-dollar event canceled. 

That Friday was a normal day. I worked at a funeral viewing as an usher for some extra cash. The viewing was relatively low attendance, in the middle of the viewing I got an email that my college was fully virtual for the rest of the spring semester. I ate some dinner at a restaurant with a friend and that next morning my family awoke me at 7 to go to a warzone grocery store and get a haircut.

Most commentators seem to assume that Oxford first partnered with the American Merck, but I think it really was the German Merck KGaA.

According to a press release from Merck KGaA dated April 14th:

&gt; Merck, a leading science and technology company, and The Jenner Institute today announced that the Jenner Institute has laid the foundation for large-scale production of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, **ChAdOx1 nCoV-19**.

[Merck Supports Jenner Institute to Reach First Milestone in Covid-19 Vaccine Manufacturing](https://www.merckgroup.com/en/news/jenner-milestone-covid-19-vaccine-manufacturing-14-04-2020.html)

Then two weeks later, AstraZeneca announced for the same vaccine:

&gt; AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford today announced an agreement for the global development and distribution of the University‚Äôs potential recombinant adenovirus vaccine aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection from SARS-CoV-2.

&gt; The collaboration aims to bring to patients the potential vaccine known as **ChAdOx1 nCoV-19**, being developed by the Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group, at the University of Oxford. Under the agreement, AstraZeneca would be responsible for development and worldwide manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine.

Yes the end of the 2cond wave was a sharper decline, but...:

1. There was no British variant then, which leads to greater spread and more severe cases among 50- population.
2. Far more restrictions are now lifted than back then. We never had all the kids back to school, we didn't allow for crowds in sports events, weddings with up to 300 people, street parties, mass funerals and so on.
3. People were more compliant with restrictions. 

Lastly, previous lockdown was more timely, we went into lockdown before massive spread happened, and so it could stop the spread early enough.

1) as stated earlier, cracking down on vaccine exports only mean shit if the company fails to deliver. Now, if the EU should take the fall for this or limit its losses is not an objective truth and either way makes sense as an argument. As long as we get our contractual doses I‚Äôm fine with exports. AZ is a shitshow through and through however and it is their fault that Aus is suffering a delayed vaccine program, not the EU‚Äôs. Furthermore, covid spread is higher in the EU and we need the doses more. Aus can wait as they have a lower spread. 

2) I don‚Äôt report or downvote people I have a discussion with.

3) Indeed the development of vaccines were a worldwide effort. The production of them is not. If Australia or another country want an independent production however they could fund a production facility like the UK has done

4) So UK and US can have zero exports but when EU limits just one vaccine from export because of the failed contract EU is the bad guy?

[],,scthoma4,,,[],,,,text,t2_12btbt,False,False,[],"I knew something was going on on March 11th, but I didn't think much of it. I went through the H1N1 stuff living on a college campus and my life never changed. Why would this be any different?

March 12th was a Thursday. It was my last day of work before our spring break. My boss advised me to take my laptop home with me just in case. I did. And then I met up with a friend for a beer tasting event that night.

On March 13th I packed up for my honeymoon. We were going to drive a few states away and stay in the mountains for a week. At some point in the afternoon I got an email from work saying that we would be closed an extra week, so I was happy. An extra week off? Who wouldn't be? My husband and I went to Target that night to get road snacks and a new jacket for him for our trip.

On March 14th I woke up with a sinking feeling in stomach. We hemmed and hawed all day about leaving for our honeymoon the next morning, and eventually cancelled 30 minutes before the cancellation deadline. There were rumors of state borders closing in the US, and with how quickly everything was changing we decided we would cancel now and try again after everything blew over.

On March 15th, I hiked around a local area and tried to get some groceries. It was a mad house.

The following weekend my family and I drove four hours away to see my grandfather for what was possibly the last time (it was). His doctor said his cancer treatments were cancelled, and my grandfather said he was done with treatment altogether if that was the case. He had a particularly gruesome cancer that resulted in the amputation of his nose and the degradation of his upper palatte. He already had a very poor quality of life and decided he was done if treatments were being cancelled. I chronicled the trip on Instagram for my brother, who lives across the country and wasn't allowed to travel outside a certain radius from him job. This day was also my first encounter with how nasty social media would become. A (now former) friend commented on one of my story posts and said that I deserved to have my grandparents die because of my irresponsible travel. She didn't know I was going to see my dying grandfather. She never apologized.

The next day state parks closed. A few days later, county parks closed.

I had my first online class experience during this week. It was terrible. It would continue to be a terrible experience, even to this day. PhD workshops do not translate well to an online environment, and I stand by this assessment to this day.

Work from home went terribly as well. My company culture is not designed for remote work, and this isn't something that can change overnight. They opened up for voluntary returns in July, and almost everyone was back by August. It's nice having some leeway to work from home occasionally, but I would never choose full time remote work for myself in my current housing set-up.

We did end up taking our honeymoon in June. It was so needed by that point.

I've lived a pretty normal life, sans masks and a few restrictions here and there, since July. I'm still in online classes, but this is the last semester of that. Either classes come back in the fall (and tentatively they are) or I'm taking a leave of absence.

Anyways, I got home around 6:30, made some dinner and looked at my phone. It was there I saw Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID and I thought everyone close to Rudy was going to get really sick and potentially die.

The days to follow were just crazy. I work in news.... There was no news other than every event was cancelled. Schools got cancelled (where I live school never gets cancelled) It was fucked.

I disagree. No policy with regards to what people should wear and where they were it is a practical option to those with a small government attitude. I see people make that argument all the time. I think that during a pandemic, it is a smart option for the government to stop in and mandate stuff like this for public health, but many small government-minded people want the government to step out of this and let businesses decide who can enter their place of business and what the requirements are to enter.

This isn't quite the same as ""government should do nothing except military""-type people. This is just wanting the government to step out of what needs to be worn and when. 

Mandating people wear masks is actually a pretty damn huge reach for the US government, the likes that I've never witnessed in my 35 years on this planet thus far.

Again, you‚Äôre mistaken.

I claimed Pfizer was included under the EU vaccination export control law. I then linked to an article explaining that the EU is cracking down on vaccine exports.

My whole point is, other countries have quota contracts with AZ and other vaccine companies but the EU doesn‚Äôt care. It could share the burden of lower than expected manufacturing output with other customers. But it doesn‚Äôt. 

If EU quotas aren‚Äôt met IN FULL other countries (as has happened in Australia) no longer get any of their vaccine shipments not even a lower amount.

That‚Äôs all I was ever saying. The EU is putting its own first and cracking down on vaccine exports. 

So don‚Äôt pretend otherwise when I say the EU is now cracking down on vaccine exports and report my comment for some bs reason to get it removed. What I said then and now is true. 

Now as a direct consequence of EU actions, Australia‚Äôs vaccination program has been delayed nationwide.

The EU may be manufacturing the vaccine, but let‚Äôs not pretend they had the only hand in creating it. The UK had a pretty big hand in AZ, no?

Also no one cares vaccine companies are using the EUs ‚Äúelectricity and labour‚Äù AZ and all other vaccine companies are paying market rate for it and probably invested in building factories in the EU.
