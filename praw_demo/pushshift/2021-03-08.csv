This simply isn‚Äôt sustainable in the long term.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 

They're already working on a second generation of vaccine's that specifically [targets transmission](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/feb/21/scientists-say-clinical-trials-for-variant-proof-vaccines-could-start-very-soon).  
  
I'm quite sure the reason all of our vaccines right now target death, is because back in February and March of 2020 when these were conceived and developed, everyone was freaking out about this killing us all. Yes there was a 1% figure out there, but people didn't *feel* sure. The reason the streets were empty in late March and April, in a harsh lockdown we have not seen since, was because people didn't know what to make of this virus. They just knew it could kill you and were afraid. This generated compliance. But once it started to set in that only ~1% of people die from it and they realized what 1% meant to them personally, they started saying ""forget it - I'm going out"". And we haven't had any sort of empty streets like we saw back in April since.  
  
That moment in time, when everyone was actually scared of dying, was prevalent in the labs at Pfizer and Moderna and J&amp;J too. I mean, they *knew the numbers*, but the entire context of the pandemic was framed in this fearful way about death. And in this somewhat hysterical zeitgeist, we made vaccines with that in mind.  
  
But of course preventing deaths is a hugely important thing. And 500,000+ deaths is obviously horrible. But I've said from the start we need to frame this virus as it really is - a virus that maims your body, and sometimes kills you. Waaay more people getting hit with the virus are getting hurt from it than die.   
  
When it's framed as only a thing that kills you, and you come to realize your age-group only puts you at a .2% chance of death, you're not going to comply with strict public safety. We should have told people from the start how this scars people's lungs, can cause long-term brain damage, heart problems, and even reduce male fertility. Even in asymptomatic cases.  
  
 
 We framed this all wrong from the start and now our ""solution"" isn't the fix we all expected it to be a year ago when we began this adventure. We thought we just had to suck it up until the vaccine came, and then everything would go back to normal. 
  
Well they've been telling us for a while now that there will be **no going back to normal**, and that we have to learn to **live with this virus**. What exactly does this mean? It means our vaccines don't end this virus. And this case study in BC is a great fucking initial case study of what exactly that means.",,,1615286393,{},gqbbt7v,False,t3_m11jgz,False,True,t1_gqbamk7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m11jgz/new_outbreak_of_covid19_in_bc_care_home_where/gqbbt7v/,1615286404,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,atealein,,,[],,,,text,t2_zj96m,False,False,[],"**The vaccination against covid-19 already seems to have led to reduced corona mortality in Sweden, SvD's compilation shows.**

**- This is expected, says epidemiologist Jonas Bj√∂rk.**

**Just over two** months ago, vaccination against covid-19 began in Sweden. According to the Swedish Public Health Agency's latest statistics, about 600,000 people have since started the vaccination, and half of them have had time to receive two doses of the vaccine.

In the first vaccination phase, priority is given to people in elderly care and certain care staff. SvD's compilation shows that vaccination already seems to have begun to have an effect in the statistics.

Among other things, the number of deaths in terms of the number of confirmed cases of infection has decreased recently.

**During November,** December and January, the relationship between the two measures was fairly constant. At that time, there were usually 60-70 confirmed cases of infection on each corona-related death, considering how many tested positive two weeks before the date of death.

For example, almost 100 deaths per day occurred at the end of December, and in the middle of the month, approximately 6,500 people tested positive every day, which corresponds to 65 positive cases two weeks earlier per each death.

But now it looks different.

( figure of the ratio of mortality to confirmed cases - [https://svd-graphics.s3.amazonaws.com/svg/ThomasSVG/2021/nyh%20coronad%C3%B6dligheten%20mars%202021%201.svg](https://svd-graphics.s3.amazonaws.com/svg/ThomasSVG/2021/nyh%20coronad%C3%B6dligheten%20mars%202021%201.svg) )  
( figure of the confirmed cases in elderly homes - [https://svd-graphics.s3.amazonaws.com/svg/ThomasSVG/2021/nyh%20coronad%C3%B6dligheten%20mars%202021%202.svg](https://svd-graphics.s3.amazonaws.com/svg/ThomasSVG/2021/nyh%20coronad%C3%B6dligheten%20mars%202021%202.svg) )

**In mid-** February, there were instead about 110 positive cases of each corona death according to the same measure. This indicates that covid-19 mortality may have halved since vaccination began.

What the relationship between death rates and infection rates has looked like in the last two to three weeks is unclear because there is a lag in the statistics on the number of deaths.

Another sign that the vaccination has had an effect is that the number of cases in nursing homes has plummeted in recent weeks.

During the second wave, approximately two percent of all new cases of infection occurred in nursing homes. But in the last week of February, only 40 new cases were discovered in the country's homes, which corresponds to 0.15 percent of all confirmed cases that week.

**Cases** in the home care service have also decreased, but not as much.

Jonas Bj√∂rk, professor of epidemiology at Lund University, says that the development is not surprising.

\- This is expected, and reasonably the effects are starting to be seen now, he says to SvD.

But he warns against excessive optimism. Even though the mortality rate in covid-19 thus seems to have decreased, the relatively high spread of infection in society may continue to lead to a large number of seriously ill people and a high burden on healthcare in the near future.

\- It's not just about death rates. It has been seen that those who are admitted to hospital now tend to be a little younger than before. And it should be remembered that large parts of the risk groups and the 70-plus in general do not yet have full vaccination protection.

**Recently, the** question of a possible shutdown of society has been debated. This is mainly due to the fact that the government has prepared a law that will make such a measure possible, and that the Center Party's leader Annie L√∂√∂f has called for [closing down parts of Sweden](https://www.svd.se/hardare-krav-pa-munskydd-infor-coronasamtal) for two or three weeks to curb the infection.

Jonas Bj√∂rk says that he finds it difficult to decide whether stricter restrictions are now necessary or not.

\- Such a measure does not have to be based on the death toll, but on wanting to avoid many in the risk groups becoming seriously ill. In any case, it is probably stupid to start letting go of the restrictions too soon.

**The Swedish Public Health Agency wrote** in a report last week that it is estimated that it will take a few months before the vaccination's effect on the total spread of infection becomes really noticeable.

State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has warned several times that the risk of a third wave is great. During Sunday's SVT Agenda, however, he said that the increase in recent weeks in the number of newly confirmed cases is not as extensive as previous infections.

\- We have an upswing in Sweden, but it is not dramatic. It is much calmer than it was before Christmas when we saw a very dramatic increase. So obviously the added restrictions we added have always had an effect, said Anders Tegnell.",,,1615283566,{},gqb8wac,True,t3_m139ci,False,True,t3_m139ci,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m139ci/sweden_signs_of_reduced_mortality_by_covid19/gqb8wac/,1615283576,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Then you have the people who suspect they have Covid but just decide to isolate for a couple weeks because they're already working from home so it's easier to just not go for walks and put off the grocery trip a couple weeks rather than making an appointment for the first available one which is IN THREE WEEKS, and calling every day to see if any appointments opened up or going in person to a place every day to see if they can squeeze you in without an appointment, thus spreading your suspected Covid germs around the community every time you do that. There could be exponentially more mild and moderate cases than we will ever know. I think the hospitalization numbers are the only really useful statistics for Covid transmission. And in the end, we only need to tackle Covid differently than common colds and flu because of the much higher hospitalization and death rates anyway. As long as we're spreading and incubating it around the community and creating new strains of it, we'll keep seeing hospitalizations, and we should absolutely focus on EVERYONE following whatever protocol keeps the spread down. I'm very scared that Americans will get themselves all comfortable with terrifyingly higher death rates every year compared to the already far too high death rates from the flu each year. We should always wear a mask in public if we feel a cold might be coming in, or when we return to work when we feel a bit better but know we're not totally over it yet (most jobs in the U.S. will fire you if you take more than 3 days in a row off without a doctor's note saying you had a horrible illness). I'm sure we won't start doing that. Instead most Americans will just get comfortable with much higher death rates from infectious diseases every year.

I just don't feel the urgency to get my act together and study with online classes. I'm not even the most competitive person in the world but I just need to be in that kind of environment for me to get motivated. My whole life I've always needed that slap in my face reality check with schoolwork to make me get it together and I just don't get that staring at a screen all day.  Even in undergrad, when so many would skip, I would always attend class even when it was not required, because even on days I was not paying attention, I just needed that constant reminder in my face so I would not lose track. Now we don't even get that and I just don't feel motivated to do anything, especially because our classes are all based on one final in the end of the semester. We don't even know whats gonna happen next week with all the chaos thats been going on the last year yet I'm supposed to be laser focused on a bunch of exams that are 4 months away, all the while my mental health is deteriorating and I'm not learning anything.

My whole life I've tried to avoid being in my room on my laptop as much as I can because I know how easily I get distracted/lose focus and now I literally cannot escape it. Most of our classes in person did not allow laptops because they're ""too distracting"" (even though in the few classes I was allowed to use it I'd airplane my laptop and take notes on Word) and now we're expected to be fully attentive on our computers all day and we can't even turn off WiFi to stay focused. Legit I spent years coming up with the right study routines and while I was not perfect (I still get pretty distracted even in normal circumstances) the pandemic threw such a wrench into that and I still have not figured out a way to fix it. All the advice I get is ""go for a walk to clear up your head!"" but sorry, that can only go so far when I still have to do my work in my room on my computer with no interaction with my peers. I'd rather have classes in person+be able to go to the library to do work (library near me is just starting to open up consistently now but even that has such limited hours) and have to spend my free time in my room (tbh I was doing that a decent amount before the pandemic) than being able to go outside in my free time (as we can do now) and being forced to get work done in my room. My productivity is in the gutter and I just can't get myself motivated.

Sounds terrible but legit some of the zeal/passion I had which led me to go to law school in the first place has fizzled out.

You mean they're doing as poorly as other poorly-run states. Gotcha.

&gt; I'm not saying we should have just let it rip through the population

Except what you're saying would mean that happens.

&gt; the playbook identified ways to target the ""pinch points"" so to speak, and to otherwise let life go on.

Whose ""playbook""?

&gt; closing schools is a good example

A good example of why you're wrong, sure.

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/science-and-research/transmission_k_12_schools.html

""COVID-19 transmission in schools is associated with community transmission.""

The other part of the equation, as always, is:
""Evidence to date suggests that when schools implement mitigation strategies with fidelity, transmission within schools can be limited.""

But if you know any teachers, many schools did *not* do that. Since anti-makers and the reality-averse decided to make it a political thing, many schools in the south especially didn't bother with precautions.

When our country is such a gigantic shitshow and didn't believe in mass testing last year, it's pretty hard to point to the cause...but if you follow experts, they predicted huge surges and most of them were worse than predicted.

&gt; I think limiting large gatherings, mask requirements where necessary (like in shopping/eating venues) and short, targeted lockdowns would have done about the same, or maybe better, in controlling the spread, and would have minimized collateral damage to society and the economy.

This is essentially what Sweden did and it backfired miserably.

It's absolutely fine to criticize and improve the system, particularly when new information comes to light. This is why the CDC announced that people who are completely vaccinated can meet up in private, unmasked, with minimal value.

There's low odds that a vaccinated person would transmit COVID to an unvaccinated person, but if the unvaccinated person is your 90-year-old grandma then that low odds event could kill her, and a lot of people won't be comfortable with that level of risk while there's still significant community spread of COVID. On the other hand, if the unvaccinated person is your 10-year-old son, then even the low odds event will probably at worst give him the sniffles and a low grade fever for a few days.",,,1615268874,{},gqast38,False,t3_m0ax32,False,True,t1_gqaol90,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m0ax32/daily_discussion_thread_march_08_2021/gqast38/,1615268885,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
[],,6Mass1Hole7,,,[],,,,text,t2_9owi440j,False,True,[],"I shouldn‚Äôt have just mentioned partying as part of the wild child phase. I meant it more as that general time in your life where you have the freedom to grow and try new things with little repercussion. High school and college are formative years where kids and young adults get to explore themselves and discover who they are. I think back to all the cool clubs and activities that I participated in during the college - you simply CAN‚ÄôT get that same experience by sitting in front of a computer. 

As for all those kids on the sidelines - they learn something during these formative years too, even if they aren‚Äôt out partying and being socialites. Hell, I was one of those kids during high school! But, I blossomed during college and grew up a ton while also having a lot of fun and learning to be independent. Sometimes being a kid on the sidelines has it‚Äôs perks too - you can find like minded people and find your niche. Again, that‚Äôs much more difficult to do when you‚Äôre learning on a computer. 

So, I would argue that it IS incredibly heart wrenching. Because, it‚Äôs not just one year of missing out on all this - it will be much longer for many young people to pick up the pieces and bounce back. 

During this time, many young people have fallen into deep depression, wrestled with anxiety, become suicidal, developed OCD tendencies, etc. That doesn‚Äôt just go away as soon as covid is ‚Äúover‚Äù. Sure, many will bounce back just fine. But, there will also be a very significant population that suffers PTSD and other long lasting mental effects while they work through their trauma. 

So, it‚Äôs nice that you want to offer hope that it can get better later in life. But, your example isn‚Äôt true to their experience - **you didn‚Äôt deal with a massive, life-altering, traumatic pandemic and long term isolation during one or more of your formative years.** Your frame of reference is just flat out different than theirs.

**Their trauma is valid.** Instead of giving them an example of how life can be better later in life or giving them any kind of advice really, I think we should give them a voice and a chance to share their pain and mourning over losing a one of their formative years. Because, how can we give them advice when we haven‚Äôt lived in their shoes? Like I said above, you and I didn‚Äôt lose a formative year to a pandemic.

And the bigger question is: when we open up and tell people they can stop wearing masks - will that increase in transmissibility be offset by the vaccine's reduction in transmissibility? 
 
 
I get the impression Israel will be the first to let the world know. Preliminary findings suggest a vaccinated population reduces transmission to 25% of normal. My own impression, given chronic undertesting of asymptomatic spread, is that Rt is naturally ~4. But in a closed economy, that dwindles to a long-term average of ~1. So if we were to open back up and return to 4 - but at 25%, we're still sitting at 1.  
Meaning the virus becomes endemic. Until it evolves anyway.  
  
This whole plan is stupid. We're only addressing deaths, and not the serious damage it can wreak to our lungs, heart, brain, *testes*, and just about everything else. There have been studies that suggest even 50% of asymptomatic people still show long-scarring in CT scans.  
Worse of all though, the virus still slipping around just undetected among a vaccinated population provides *immense* evolutionary pressure for it to develop a variant that is truly vaccine resistant.  
  
From the start, all anyone has cared about is dying. And now that we presumably have a solution for *that* with these vaccines, no one cares if it spreads under the radar.  
  
That's literally what the CDC is saying by telling us vaccinated people can hang out, even when they know vaccine transmission is a thing.

[],,GameOfThrownaws,,,[],,,,text,t2_m0d0v,False,False,[],"I've been saying since early on that the physical and mental risk levels of this thing are exact opposites.  The greatest physical risk is to the older population, they're the ones who are mostly dying from the disease.  

But arguably, when all is said and done, the mental damage might actually be the more severe cost of this whole thing (since ""only"" 500k Americans died, while 300 million felt the unquantifiable sting of the ""new normal"").  And to me, there's no doubt that the mental aspect has been by far the worst on kids, and decreasing pretty steeply with age.  Kids and teenagers missing more than an entire year of school is insanely bad.  That's awful for their minds, their development, their socialization, just everything.  Those years are absolutely vital and limited and you do not get a second shot at that.  It's a similar disaster for college-age kids too.  Think of how many people treasure their college experience for life, not to mention how important it is with regard to setting up the rest of your life career wise and maybe even finding your partner.  It's only 4 years long, and those millions of kids have lost a QUARTER of it and counting.

I would argue this extends forward into just anyone who does not have their lives all figured out.  Anyone single.  Anyone who doesn't have the job they want.  Anyone who didn't have a great living situation.  Anyone trying to branch out.  Anyone trying to grow.  Think of some 46 year old dad who packed up his work PC in March 2020 and took it home to his 2700 sqft house in the suburbs, where he's been running his company's network ever since for full time/pay and getting to spend more time with his family, and using the extra commute time to finally get around to some of those projects he's had sitting out in the garage for 5 years.  This guy has had his life figured out for the past 10 years.  What's the mental impact on him?  Really not a lot.  Or take my 70 year old parents.  Married 50 years.  Retired.  Medicare, social security.  Everything they want and need from the world is inside their 4 walls already.  They barely leave the house in a normal year.  Pretty much nothing changed in their lives.  They get curbside pickup instead of going into the store.  That's about it.  

Compare that to a middle school kid who lost their entire 6th grade year and hasn't seen most of their friends since last March.  Or a Junior who was gearing up to try to play college ball but recruiting barely even exists now.  Or a young adult who graduated in 2020 and tried to start a new job without ever getting a chance to meet any of their coworkers.  Or just a lonely single person who was trying to meet someone in 2020.  It's not even comparable.  That level of loss on this scale of people is catastrophic, and it's being shouldered by generations of young people who have already been asked to bear so much burden (multiple once-in-a-lifetime economic disasters, hilariously low wages/wealth accumulation compared to the past, unobtainable housing, climate change doomsday, financially impossible to start a family, etc.)  I think this is a huge problem and we are going to be feeling the reverberations for many many years to come.",,,1615281519,{},gqb6v28,False,t3_m0m6k3,False,True,t3_m0m6k3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m0m6k3/the_lost_year_what_the_pandemic_cost_teenagers/gqb6v28/,1615281530,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,True

[],,chilladipa,,,[],,,,text,t2_6z8harzu,False,False,[],"A single pill of the investigational drug molnupiravir taken twice a day for 5¬†days eliminated SARS-CoV-2 from the nasopharynx of 49 participants.

That led Carlos del Rio, MD, distinguished professor of medicine at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, to suggest a future in which a drug like molnupiravir could be taken in the first few days of symptoms to prevent severe disease, similar to Tamiflu for¬†influenza.

""I think it's critically important,"" he told¬†Medscape Medical News¬†of the data. Emory University was involved in the trial of molnupiravir but del Rio was not part of that team. ""This drug offers the first antiviral oral drug that then could be used in an outpatient setting.""

Still, del Rio said it's too soon to call this particular drug the breakthrough clinicians need to keep people out of the ICU.

""It has the¬†potential¬†to be practice-changing; it's not practice-changing at the moment.""

Wendy Painter, MD, of Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, who presented the data at the virtual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, agreed. While the data are promising, ""We will need to see if people get better from actual illness"" to assess the real value of the drug in clinical care.

""That's a phase 3 objective we'll need to prove,"" she told Medscape Medical News.

Phase 2/3¬†efficacy and safety studies of the drug are now underway in hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients.

In a brief pre-recorded presentation of the data, Painter laid out what researchers know so far: preclinical studies suggest that molnupiravir is¬†effective against a number of viruses, including coronaviruses and¬†specifically¬†SARS-CoV-2. It prevents a virus from replicating by inducing¬†viral error catastrophe¬†‚Äî essentially overloading the virus with replication and mutation until the virus burns itself out and can't produce replicable copies.

In this¬†phase 2a, randomized, double-blind control trial, researchers recruited 202 adults who were treated at an outpatient clinic with fever or other symptoms of a respiratory virus and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by day 4. Participants were randomly assigned¬†to three different groups: 200 mg of molnupiravir, 400 mg; or 800 mg. The 200 mg arm was matched one-to-one with a placebo-controlled group, and the other two groups had three participants in the active group for every one control.

Participants took the pills twice daily for 5 days, and then were followed for a total of 28 days to monitor for complications or adverse events. At days 3, 5, 7, 14, and 28, researchers also took nasopharyngeal swabs for PCR tests, to sequence the virus, and to grow cultures of SARS-CoV-2 to see if the virus that's present is actually capable of infecting others.

Notably, the pills do not have to be refrigerated at any point in the process, alleviating the cold-chain challenges that have plagued vaccines.

""There's an urgent need for an easily produced, transported, stored, and administered antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2,"" Painter said.

Of the 202 people recruited, 182 had swabs that could be evaluated, of which 78 showed infection at baseline. The results are based on labs of those 78 participants.

By day 3, 28% of patients in the placebo arm had SARS-CoV-2 in their nasopharynx, compared to 20.4% of patients receiving any dose of molnupiravir. But by day 5, none of the participants receiving the active drug had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in their nasopharynx. In comparison, 24% of people in the placebo arm still had detectable virus.

Halfway through the treatment course, differences in the presence of infectious virus were already evident. By day 3 of the 5-day course, 36.4% of participants in the 200 mg group had detectable virus in the nasopharynx, compared with¬†21% in the 400 mg group and just 12.5% in the 800 mg group. And although the reduction in SARS-CoV-2 was noticeable in the 200 mg and the 400 mg arms, it was only statistically significant in the 800 mg arm.

In contrast, by the end of the 5 days in the placebo groups, infectious virus varied from 18.2% in the 200 mg placebo group¬†to 30% in the 800 mg group. This points out the variability of the disease course of SARS-CoV-2.

""You just don't know"" which infections will lead to serious disease, Painter told¬†Medscape Medical News. ""And don't you wish we did?""

Seven participants discontinued treatment, though only four experienced adverse events. Three of those discontinued the trial due to adverse events. The study is still blinded, so it's unclear what those events were, but Painter said that they were not thought to be related to the study drug.

The bottom line, said Painter, was that people treated with molnupiravir had starkly different outcomes in lab measures during the study.

""An average of 10 days after symptom onset, 24% of placebo patients remained culture positive"" for SARS-CoV-2 ‚Äî meaning¬†there wasn't just virus in the nasopharynx, but it was capable of replicating, Painter said. ""In contrast, no infectious virus could be recovered at study day 5 in any molnupiravir-treated patients.""",,,1615281370,{},gqb6pyf,True,t3_m12tl7,False,True,t3_m12tl7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m12tl7/fiveday_course_of_oral_antiviral_appears_to_stop/gqb6pyf/,1615281381,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The problem is that if economic conditions make many of the people who want 2 kids have 1 or 0 instead, and many of the (25%) of people who want 3 have 2, 1 or 0 instead, that's a pretty big deal without the need to make up any extreme world when people want to have lots of kids. That simple fact is more than enough to push the fertility rate down from 2.something (healthy) to significantly less than 2 (decreasing population).

Homecoming happened on schedule.

The result, according to Superintendent Lance Johnson, has been a higher enrollment and average daily attendance numbers ahead of last year.

I was the classic skinny kid growing up, then got in shape by lifting in college, then ballooned to a BMI of 29 in med school while studying for boards, then got in the best shape of my life (10% body fat, constant comments about my fitness from others) after over a year of very strict diet and exercise. Then of course COVID hit and I'm back to BMI of 26 with absolutely no muscle to speak of. No one asked, but I've learned a few extremely valuable things along the way

1) Mitigation is extremely important. The ""fuck it, I've already lost"" attitude is the wrong one. The best place to stop binging a tub of Ben and Jerry's is wherever you're at when you realize you're making a mistake. You can set yourself back a week with a single binge. You can set yourself back months with a month or two of apathy. Even yo-yo dieting, for as much hate as it gets, prevents a steady rise in weight gain and makes getting in shape for real much easier.

2) Count calories. If you're overweight, you'll almost definitely be hungry even after crossing your calorie threshold for the day. People think if you just eat ""healthy"" you can be full and lose weight. Any successful weightloss journey will involve going to bed with a rumbling stomach from time to time.

3) Lift weights while dieting to ensure you're losing fat. It's also a fantastic motivator because you'll see fitness progress very quickly in hard numbers.

4) Alcohol is basically completely incompatible with weight loss. It's a highly caloric beverage that makes you even hungrier. When I was dieting, even a single glass of wine at dinner made hitting my calorie goals much, much harder.

5) Meal prep. Also, stuff like intermittent fasting/OMAD actually works decently well.

It sucks. We live in a world where you are set up for failure. I hope we see some sort of action from society (i.e. a complete rejection of unhealthy foods), but ultimately we can only control ourselves.",,,1615255690,{},gqa6yn4,False,t3_m0ls8c,False,True,t1_gqa3hob,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m0ls8c/cdc_obese_adults_at_higher_risk_for/gqa6yn4/,1615258514,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Literally saying the effect was found only when counting schools are colleges @ the same time. Ofc college students spread COVID and it's not from class it's from parties so sending them home will slow it down. Is it worth it is a whole separate question. Point being your only evidence considers elementary schools combined with colleges which is just total BS and it's intellectually dishonest to say this study means that

&gt;under all circumstances, in all areas, at all stages of spread, schools being shut was by far the most effective.. without question.

Because this study straight up does not even say that.

Literally even counting colleges.

&gt;the percentage reduction in *Rt* (with 95% prediction interval; [**Fig. 2**](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6531/eabd9338#F3)) associated with each NPI was as follows  
&gt;  
&gt;gatherings to 10 people or less: 42%   
&gt;  
&gt;closing both schools and universities in conjunction: 38%

Even the mainstream media/scientific narrative is for opening schools.

As others ITT have noted, there's also 28 million confirmed U.S. cases (really 28.6 million, but then 520k of those were fatal.) Just those 28MM would add another 8.5% of the American public who had COVID, recovered from it, and developed some level of antibodies.

It's also widely believed that quite a few Americans have had COVID that didn't make into the official numbers, such as early cases that never got tested. It's hard to say what number to assign to that -- I've seen estimates anywhere from 1/10 of the official count, or another 2.8MM, on up to **4 times** the official count or roughly 112 million Americans. Me personally, I would find it plausible for the ""real"" number to reflect half again as many cases as in the official count, or an extra 14MM cases. That would add another 4.2% of the American public.

So, 75% of adult Americans, who [themselves comprise 76% of the population](https://www.aecf.org/resources/the-changing-child-population-of-the-united-states) -- that's 57% of the grand total.

Anyway, some math:

1. For opening restaurants, the study shows 0.9% increase for 41-60 days after, 1.2% increase 61-80 days after, and 1.1% increase 81-100 days after.
2. **Assuming** 0% case growth as a control, and 0% case growth for 0-39 days after...

If you started with 1,000 cases/day, you would expect 100,000 total cases over the 100 days.

Doing the math with 40 days of 0% growth, and then 0.9%/1.2%/1.1% growth for 20 days each (total 100 days), you end with 123,471 total cases, or a **23.5% increase in total cases** over 100 days.

**True statement**: Counties that opened restaurants had \~23.5% more total cases/population than counties that did not open restaurants after 100 days.

**Not-true statement**: Opening restaurants *caused* case numbers in counties to be \~23.5% higher than they would have been otherwise.

P.S. For anyone that wants to double-check my math, note that in the study they used natural logs, so cases were increasing by e\^(0.009) and not by 1.009 for days 41-60, etc.",,,1615270501,{},gqauwei,False,t3_m0ypx4,False,True,t3_m0ypx4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m0ypx4/opening_restaurants_led_to_a_09_increase_in_covid/gqauwei/,1615270511,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Pfizer have said that from start to finish it takes about 100 days to manufacture a batch of vaccines.  That is after everything is setup and running.

I'm not sure if I'm missing something about how infections work or if the article just doesn't explain it properly, but I'm having trouble understanding how a higher replication rate could be a good thing. Does infection severity not correlate with your viral load? Or does it increase the mutation rate too?

For the sake of making the numbers easier, let's say in a normal infection the virus would replicate at a rat of 1000/day and the mutation rate makes it nonviable at around the 1 million virus mark (i.e.: it would take 1000 days for the virus to burn itself out naturally, by which time you're either long-recovered or dead).

He gets criticized for ""shifting the goalposts"", but really all that he does is that he approaches the interviews he gives very casually and when asked to make predictions he'll give whatever answer he's feeling on that day. This would be remedied if we weren't getting four or five TV appearances from him per week and he cut it down to one. He doesn't need to take any interviews at all, he really could just host press conferences in his position. 

He doesn't have to do it like this and it's hurting his ability to get his messages to an audience.

We were on the verge of nervous, but the reported cases in our area were virtually non existent, and what we knew January 2020 is very different than what we knew even a month later.

I was kind of happy because we bought nosebleeds, and I could relax a bit without being crowded (a preference of mine anyway)... But it was early-AEW attendence and they needed to fill hard cam, so they moved us. They tripled the value of our seats, but we were surrounded and I was acutely aware of every sneeze and cough for the next 3 hours. On the upside, math was in my favor, and we were fine, although we decided to skip GenCon after that.

My friend in NJ was trying to get tickets for the Dynamite in Newark, which eventually became the ill-fated Blood &amp; Guts show. She worked at an event ticketing partner and was trying to get actually good seats but kept missing them... Also for the best. I think that also became the ""so we might be out of business in a week, but let's have some Wrestling"" episode.

Fun fact, if you are into The Deep Smark Lore: Cody got ribbed into giving a kid his boots after the show. It's the white boots, I believe the white ones when the red Nightmare Family logo, the ones they chose for his first Rivals figure.

&gt;In October 2020, Alex Azar predicted a hundred million available doses by the end of the year.[60] The Trump administration later reduced the goal to twenty million doses, although Operation Warp Speed received praise for its historical accomplishment of producing a vaccine in less than a year. As of January 6, 2021, the CDC was reporting 17,288,950 doses distributed, but only 5,306,797 actually administered to a person.[61] Of those, 3,416,875 were distributed and 511,635 administered through the Federal Pharmacy Partnership. (General Gustave Perna said reporting delays cause the administration numbers to lag by 72 to 96 hours.[62])

Sourced directly from your article.  The administration was missing EVERY SINGLE goal they set.

A nice fair and balanced article on the failures of the Trump administration.  To say there was no plan--is fine, inaccurate.  To say there was an actual federal response, is laughably inaccurate.  Again, as I stated in my first commentary--the Trump administration left it to the states.  Refused any involvement and most experts agree it was woefully incapable.

The lunacy that 50 states could perform equally as well on a distribution plan as one entity with the capability to host/hire/consult the top experts from around the world is the laughable portion of it.

For the first time, researchers have found evidence of the novel coronavirus undergoing mutation in an infected newborn. According to the study, researchers observed the genetic change five days after birth.

Dr Mehreen Zaigham reports that a 27-year-old pregnant woman had presented to Sk√•ne University Hospital, in Malmo, Sweden, with severe abdominal pain. Along with a history of fever, dry cough, and reduced fetal movements. Doctors immediately performed a cardiotocograph (CTG) test which showed a low fetal heart rate. Therefore, doctors rushed her for an emergency caesarean section. The woman was in her 34th week of pregnancy at the time.

Upon birth, the newborn required resuscitation and oxygen supplementation. The hospital staff then kept the newborn in isolation. During the first 60 hours of life, the newborn had no contact with the mother or any family member. As per national guidelines, hospital staff also collected nasopharyngeal swabs from the mother upon admission and 48 hours after delivery from the neonate. Both of which came back positive.

Since the baby had been isolated from the mother directly after the caesarean and had not come in contact with other family members when these tests were done, the findings confirmed that the baby was indeed infected before it was born.

**A Genetic Shift**

The newborn in the study developed no other symptoms and tested positive for antibodies soon after. Since the mother‚Äôs breast milk lacked antibodies, researchers believe the newborn‚Äôs immune system neutralized the virus itself.

Researchers performed whole-genome sequencing to confirm the infection was acquired in-utero. Swabs from both mother and fetus along with samples of the placenta underwent genetic sequencing. Results showed that the viral genome in both mother and newborn was identical. However, genetic sequencing done on a neonatal sample collected a few days later, showed a change in the genetic sequence of the virus. The mutation occurred five days after delivery. Researchers believe a change in environment from the mother‚Äôs womb may have stimulated the genetic change.

The study also reported changes in the placenta. This included widespread damage due to inflammation on both the maternal and fetal side. Consequently, researchers believe that even a mild infection in pregnant women can lead to placental dysfunction; thus, resulting in low oxygen in the fetus. However, not all transplacental coronavirus transmissions lead to severe consequences in newborns.

The case study is published in The British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

There are massive resource management issues at play here, that sort of rely on a very high level of global cooperation. 

Ancient humans were about as ""smart"" as modern humans, but a huge amount of technological innovation occurred in a very short amount of time and that's in large part due to there having only been small windows of time in which that was possible. We could last for millions of years as a species, but that doesn't get us to the stars or make us into immortal robots if we're spending all of our time struggling to survive. 

Stuff like climate change and world war could screw all that up. And while it might not mean *extinction* of our species, it could easily screw things up to the point where we're never able to muster up the resources to get off this planet or gain technological immortality. Back to relatively small farming communities until we eventually get back to a large inter-connected global society and then screw it up *again*.

I can point you at some source that were all produced before December that were claiming that it was likely that mutations sufficient to achieve immune escape would be expensive and unlikely.  And I know there was the claim kicking around epidemiology twitter that the spike protein had 20 epitopes and that would make immune escape very unlikely (I don't recall the name of the researcher that was posting that but it was getting picked up and repeated a lot).

But then the variants all happened and quite a few of those have mutations in spike epitopes that increase binding to ACE2 rather than come at a cost to fitness.  So now papers tend to waffle a lot.

Offhand you might be interested in this paper on 229E which might or might not be a better analog than influenza:

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.17.423313v1

I'm also just not certain it matters due to cross reactivity even in the absence of sterilizing immunity:

https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6530/741

I don't think anyone really knows what the cost to fitness will be of immune escape or how fast it'll really happen, but I'm not sure that's the right question.

Also this preprint on cross reactive T-cell and variants:

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.27.433180v1.article-metrics

I doubt that the variants will ever achieve immune escape from T-cells and reset the pandemic back to zero (which didn't happen with 1918 H1N1 either, it came back as seasonal influenza, and there was immune cross reactivity from the pre-1957 strains to the 2009 H1N1 outbreak).

1. COVID deaths and severity are *very* strongly correlated with age, in quite a few states there are single digit deaths in the under 20 or under 30 age group, and almost all of those are probably immune compromised people. So many young college educated people realize their risk is low. Where the difference lies is that some people feel very responsible for trying not to spread the virus to at-risk populations, while others are far more individualistic and feel that if they are not at high risk, they should be allowed to live their life however they want. So if by ‚ÄúCOVID truthers‚Äù you mean that they view the restrictions as overbearing and inappropriate, it‚Äôs generally just a different viewpoint on life.

2. Even if they support the moral idea that we should protect the elderly, many are against the legal punishments used to enforce that idea.

3. With regards to the vaccine, I‚Äôve seen two major things that make people ‚Äúhesitant‚Äù - one is the political pressure, such as the White House threatening the head of the FDA with being fired unless he gave the mRNA vaccines an EUA, and they literally got an EUA the next day. You can look this up if you want. Of course, at the time they were believed to be getting an EUA the next day anyways, but it was not good optics and made people feel that political pressure caused the thing to be approved when it otherwise may not have been. The second big thing is the perception that the science was rushed. Phase 3 trials are normally longer than they were this time, and while a lot of that has to do with the fact that incidence rate of the virus was high (so it was easy to show efficacy), a lot of people noticed that the messaging went from ‚Äúit takes many years to develop vaccines, it‚Äôs a pipe dream‚Äù during Trump‚Äôs early 2020 days to ‚Äúthis is safe, take it‚Äù by fall.

Please stop peddling that anti-scientific crap. There's no such thing as a ""second first dose"". 

That's just not how vaccines and the immune system work.

&gt;Experts say there are scientific reasons a longer interval between the initial and second dose ‚Äî typically referred to as ‚Äúprime‚Äù and ‚Äúboost‚Äù ‚Äî is not only acceptable but may be preferable.

&gt;Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University, said that after the first shot, the body produces both ‚Äúeffector‚Äù cells, which fight what they perceive to be an infection, and ‚Äúmemory‚Äù cells, which retain information about the infectious agent to enable long-term protection. ‚ÄúIf you give the second dose too soon, you are mostly targeting the effector cells and not memory cells,‚Äù Dr. Iwasaki said.

&gt;The intervals that the vaccine manufacturers settled on are relatively short compared with some other vaccines. Gary Kobinger, who specializes in vaccine development at Laval University, said that the urgency to produce a vaccine for COVID-19 would have led companies to compress the intervals between doses as much as possible to shorten the duration of the clinical trials.

We don't judge parents all over the country for strapping their kids into cars to go to school, because the value of school (or grandma, or playdates) is worth that tiny risk.

We are doing what we need to do right now, and that's important.

* Make accounts on [CVS.com](https://CVS.com), [Walgreens.com](https://Walgreens.com), [Riteaid.com](https://Riteaid.com), Giant Eagle
* Check CVS every morning between 5am-7am repeatedly. I see plenty of availability there every morning
* Check [RiteAid.com](https://RiteAid.com) after midnight each day
* For Walgreens &amp; Giant Eagle I don't know when they post new appts.
* Use this too: [https://www.vaxxmax.com/riteaid](https://www.vaxxmax.com/riteaid) for Rite-aid and Walgreens. This will give you an idea of what zipcodes to put into the various sites. Don't be afraid to check zipcodes a bit further.
* On Walgreens, try youngstown as the location. There are often tons of appts there.
* If you are really motivated, check CVS location in. Lima, OH. It is a long haul, but they ALWAYS have availability. By time of the second shot, you should be able to get that closer to home.
* Also, be aware FEMA is setting up a site in downtown Cleveland area shortly as well.",,,1615319910,{},gqd73wb,False,t3_m0sphu,False,True,t1_gqcrtu4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m0sphu/ohio_drops_vaccination_age_to_50_as_new_cases/gqd73wb/,1615323078,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I also bet there's not a centralized ERP system that is tracking everything and unified nationally, so administration sites are probably playing telephone with distribution nodes and there's no systemic way to track throughput and forecast volumes for inbound/outbound to streamline the process.

Why we aren't using the military to deliver mass, come-one, come-all sites (at least 1 per metro area) and reserve the smaller venues for the at-risk is beyond me.  You could have a system that says- if your license plate ends in a 9, then come today and everyone in the car can get vaccinated, maximum of 4 people per car, and it's first-come, first served.

Do that in a big open area like a fairground or GA airport with good feeder roads for traffic control, and it alleviates the pressure that is currently on the sites doing the job.  There, you do at-risk only, with an appointment, and you stock them up, based on reservations, first.

You're absolutely right. One reason for that is the psychology behind attention-grabbing headlines and how they're used in the same way as addictive mobile games to draw you in using emotional manipulation.

The constant speculative ""WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE IN WORSE SHAPE THAN EVER SOON"" headlines are the problem. The content of the articles is not.

I completely agree that a large part of our obesity problem is due to the lack of regulation around processed foods. However, I think we can all agree that American culture is at least partly to blame. People make choices, knowingly, and Americans are mostly apathetic to the consequences when it comes to weight gain. If not completely apathetic, we are apathetic enough to do nothing about it. Obesity is a problem that spans all socioeconomic classes as well, so while socioeconomics explains some of it, it certainly does not explain all or even most. Europe also has an obesity problem, but I've yet to meet a European who isn't shocked by our portion sizes and lack of regular physical activity.

‚ÄúDuring a response to a pathogen, such as a virus, your immune system produces large amounts of a limited set of antibodies. Think of a virus as a car trying to run you over. You might produce one kind of antibody against the hood, one against the bumper, and one against the hubcaps that prevents the wheels from turning. You have produced three kinds of antibodies that are specific to the car, but only the hubcap antibodies will slow the car down. Your immune system will remember how to produce all three, and doesn‚Äôt distinguish between them.

Now the virus-car mutates. It changes the changes the shape of the hubcaps, changes the material, or removes them altogether. Your immune system will remember the car ‚Äì but not the hubcaps. The system doesn‚Äôt know that targeting the hubcap was the only important part, so it will ramp up its attack on the hood and bumper ‚Äì minimizing the importance of all other responses. It may ‚Äútweak‚Äù its hubcap response, or perhaps even develop a new one from scratch, but that process will be slow and certainly of lower priority.

In ignoring the new hubcap response, the immune system‚Äôs memory of the original car is not only obsolete, but actively interfering with the response necessary to target the new car‚Äôs wheels. This is what immunologists call ‚Äòoriginal antigenic sin‚Äô ‚Äì ineffective immune memory that hampers desired responses to new pathogen strains. This phenomenon is well documented in influenza where seasonal variants and repeat vaccinations dominate the landscape.

As a parent, I'm also extremely risk averse about my son's health, but you have to actually look at the research and do the math here. There's is a [0.002%](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160895v7) chance that a ten year old who actually catches COVID will die. I suspect the chance that a single visit with a vaccinated person with no COVID symptoms will result in the ten year old catching COVID is close to 0%, let's say 0.1% (in practice I suspect significantly less than this so long as we aren't in the middle of a huge COVID case spike, but let's use this number for the sake of argument). So if my math and assumptions are right, the chance of a ten year old dying because of a visit from a vaccinated person is less than 0.0000002%. If that's true, literally every single ten year old in the US could receive one visit from a fully vaccinated person and the chances that even *one* of those ten year olds would die is less than 1%. Health risk for ten year olds receiving visits from vaccinated people is just infinitesimally small to the point where worrying about protecting them from contracting COVID from vaccinated family members is itself more harmful than missing out on years of socialization and development and love. Note this math does NOT apply to higher risk populations like the very elderly.

&gt; We're gonna vaccinate 70-80% of the pop but kids make up 1/3rd of the population and they're ineligible.

Ineligible for now. That will change in the coming months as trials start to demonstrate safety in younger and younger age groups.

I was able to ask one expert and she wasn't able to give me the list of actions that are still needed to be complete. I've tried reaching out to other experts and the media and just can't find the answer, so reaching out here.

We know that the FDA has granted three vaccines with EUAs, allowing us to administer these unapproved vaccines. So my question is what is left to be done for the FDA to approve them.

I have some guesses (I'm no expert), maybe a FDA Approval for a vaccine requires it be tested on children and teenagers? I know they are running those trials right now and we should get results this year or next. Testing it on pregnant women, is that also required for a FDA Approval? Again, they are working on that as we speak.

Anyways, hope I don't get a lot of hate for asking this question. Would just really appreciate the list of steps still needed to for these vaccines to be FDA Approved.

**- Normally we usually approach the peak for seasonal flu this year but now we have nothing.** **It is absolutely incredible, says Mia Brytting, microbiologist at the Swedish Public Health Agency.**

Every year, an average of around a thousand people die as a result of seasonal flu. But this year there are no deaths or illnesses registered - the curve is a straight line. The reported cases to the Public Health Agency from week 40 in the autumn and until week 8 this year are a total of 20 sick. In the statistics, it counts as zero.

\- There are so few cases that they have not even exceeded the normal baseline that says that the flu season has started this year, Mia Brytting explains.

The same development is seen in the other infections for calicivirus (winter vomiting disease) and the RS virus. The latter mainly affects young children and the elderly, and during weeks 7‚Äì8 a total of 10 cases were reported compared with last year's almost 250 cases.

\- Even there you see the fantastically straight line at the bottom, says Mia Brytting.

**The explanation for the positive development is** spelled corona pandemic and that we do not travel abroad and introduce the virus in Sweden, she explains. Already in the spring, when the restrictions on maintaining good hand hygiene, distance and staying at home at the slightest symptoms of the disease were introduced to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, a significant reduction in the other three viral infections was seen.

\- As we follow the rules for covid-19, it reduces the spread of infection for other viral infections. This is clear proof of that, says Mia Brytting.

Seasonal flu and the RS virus occur during the winter months. During the summer, activity is low. The spread of winter vomiting in society, on the other hand, occurs all year round but usually reaches a peak at the end of February.

\- It has a clear seasonal variation and we see an increase when it is cold, but you can also be infected through food, for example from oysters and frozen foreign berries, says Elsie Ydring, investigator at the Public Health Agency.

(figure for the number of laboratory verified cases of Winter vommiting disease (calicivirus): [https://api.quickshot-widgets.net/uploads/2021/03/o%CC%88vr%20sjukd%20vinterkra%CC%88kRityta%201-8-1615207713405.png](https://api.quickshot-widgets.net/uploads/2021/03/o%CC%88vr%20sjukd%20vinterkra%CC%88kRityta%201-8-1615207713405.png) )

**Unlike seasonal flu** and the RS virus, which is spread through the air, the calicivirus is transmitted through contact and infects the gastrointestinal tract. It affects all age groups and the most common way is to get it on your hands and thus get it in your mouth. In some cases, an infected food at a buffet can make hundreds of guests sick, or spread quickly and knock out an entire department of a preschool.

\- Winter vomiting is very contagious, it takes few virus particles to become infected, says Elsie Ydring.

The most important factor in the fact that there are so few cases is probably that people stay at home when they feel sick and make sure they are completely healthy before they go back to work or preschool and school, according to Elsie Ydring.

The fact that there have not been Christmas tables with buffets and that we do not meet as much or eat out at restaurants to the same extent also affects, as well as an extra good hand hygiene.

\- But hand alcohol does not work against winter vomiting, but the only way is to use soap and water. Then you can use hand alcohol as a complement to other viruses, says Elsie Ydring.

**Although it is too early to** draw any definite conclusions or analyzes, the hope is that the new thinking and routines around hygiene and disease will continue even when the corona pandemic is over.

\- What I really hope is that the lessons continue. We had the same recommendations during the swine flu in 2009, but once you were vaccinated and the pandemic wave was over, people began to let go of the restrictions. It was too short a time to have that mindset, but now we have had them for a year and hopefully they have settled down, says Mia Brytting.

## Facts / Viral diseases

**RS virus**

RS virus is an abbreviation for respiratory syncytial virus. It is easily transmitted and most children get it during their first two years. The infection is more common during the winter and usually gives the same symptoms as a common cold.

Adults and older children usually do not get any major problems, while children under one year can become seriously ill with coughing and difficulty breathing.

An infected person is contagious for about 3-8 days but can also be there for longer.

The symptoms are fever, runny nose, cough and sometimes wheezing.

RS virus infection occurs in annual epidemics during the winter months.

**Seasonal flu**

Influenza is a respiratory infection that recurs regularly each winter season. There are four types of flu viruses: A, B, C and D.

It spreads as a drip or contact infection when someone sneezes or coughs.

Infection begins the day before you get any symptoms and is highest when you are sickest.

Symptoms include chills, rapidly rising fever often above 40 degrees, general muscle aches and headaches. Vomiting and diarrhea also occur.

Between a few hundred and about 3,000 people die annually, most often people with underlying diseases and fragile elderly are affected.

It is possible to be vaccinated against seasonal flu.

**Calicivirus**

Calicivirus is a family of single-stranded RNA viruses that cause winter vomiting. It is found all over the world and can affect all age groups.

Frozen imported raspberries, oysters and food contaminated by a sick person are common causes of outbreaks.

Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness and fever.

Infected people can spread the infection for up to two days, sometimes longer, after symptom relief. The incubation period is 12-48 hours.

This fearmongering is stupid.There is no way in global pandemic you can coordinate 8bn people and expect everyone will adhere to the same standard.

Many nations are simply unwilling to implement drastic draconian CCP measures to get their population in line.

This is not on just Bolsonaro but on all countries that think that just buying and distributing vaccines is enough.

We need to wave the patents for some of the vaccines at least temporarily.
To really end this pandemic we need to make sure that most of the nations on the planet are capable of producing and distributing vaccines to their people in time.

So I called my Dr who says I have to have an appt to get Tamiflu.  Appt set up for next day but by then I was so sick I could have been offered $1 million and I couldn't have made it in.  Got tested a week later but my then it was too late to take the Tamiflu.

When I got better about 2 weeks later, I asked my Dr could I keep some at home but he said no.  I didn't care if my ins covered it, I would pay.  If it expired, I'd get more.  Wasn't an ins thing but he couldn't prescribe meds without an appt so I would have had to spread the full blown flu in his office to get a Rx.

Because I have asthma, it felt like being told to wait until you have an attack, then make an appt, then go get your Rx.  I probably would have been dead by then.

I know for my 4th grader his teacher is amazing at leading the remote class and I am glad I kept him this way and that his teacher ended up being the one for remote class in his school at his grade level. He also had a knee surgery in December (removal of a begnign soft tissue  mass that had him in pain for the past 2 years) so the way this year turned out was perfect for him since the schedule was lighter (4 hours in morning, 2hours break and one hour in PM, same for hybrid) and he was able to get to his multiple appointments, have the surgery, go to physical therapy after without affecting his school attendance (which would have been tough on a normal year and even going in person after his surgery would have made his recovery complicated since he had to rest a lot for the first 6 weeks post op). Also with back and forth between remote/hybrid in fall, some had to change teachers 2 or 3 times over first trimester, even attend remote classes in other schools from district, so glad neither him or his sister had to deal with that and had consistency that way.

But he is an exception and it doesn't make it right for all of those who lost on an educational level.

I just asked my virologist co-worker and he said everyone he's talked to is operating on the assumption that mutations will be less of a big deal once the volume of infections dies down (because COVID is far less prone to antigenic shift).

1/4 per base pair is definitely accurate (~10^-6 vs. 3x10^-5 is what I've seen). 1/2 per genome is not as significant a metric. The genomes have very different compositions and only certain areas where mutations matter for vaccination. So a larger genome will mutate more, but will also mutate more in meaningless places (or individual mutations may not have the same level of significance).

Lockdowns don't address that kind of behavior explicitly -- they more indicate to people how they should behave in general while also destroying the local business economy. 

It's due to a lack of nuance in messaging. The advice given by public health is too generalized (stay 6' away, wear a mask, don't talk to anyone), rather than based on specifics and common sense (i.e.: people thinking that you're capable of transmission &lt;6' indoors but not &gt;6', or that you need to wear a mask when you walk past someone on a hiking trail for &lt;2 seconds). 

Another issue -- at least here in the US -- is the lack of an end goal. The CDC should say something like: when we get to X, Y, or Z in the data, we can now lift this kind of restriction.

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador spearheaded efforts to attain more help from China, Ebrard said.

‚ÄúAs a result of a process personally led by the president of the republic, we have received the confirmation that we will have an expansion of up to 22 million doses,‚Äù Ebrard said during Lopez Obrador‚Äôs regular news conference.

Mexico‚Äôs vaccine roll out has been criticized as overly slow, though officials say they‚Äôve been hampered by delays in receiving vaccines amid global shortages.

The Biden administration appeared to have turned down Lopez Obrador‚Äôs request, at least in the short term, for the United States to share its vaccines by saying the immediate priority is to inoculate American citizens.

Mexico is now pinning its hopes on receiving some vaccines from the United States once Biden meets his goal of inoculating 100 million Americans in 100 days, a deadline due in late April.

Ebrard said Mexico has placed an order for an additional 10 million doses of China‚Äôs Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine to be delivered between May and July, on top of the 10 million already ordered, which are due to arrive between March and May.

Mexico will also order 12 million vaccine doses made by the state-backed China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) once it has been approved by its health regulator, Ebrard added.",,,1615313337,{},gqcsujy,True,t3_m1cdzp,False,True,t3_m1cdzp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m1cdzp/mexico_leans_on_china_after_biden_rules_out/gqcsujy/,1615316162,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;I'm under the impression that vaccinated people can still carry and transmit the virus

As this is much harder to study than efficacy, the initial studies did not study this, and scientists couldn't say anything more than ""we don't know if vaccinated people can transmit the virus"". Unfortunately, somewhere along the message chain to you, the ""we don't know if"" was dropped and this gave you the wrong impression - there never was any evidence they could, just no evidence they couldn't either. 

Now, in general vaccines do at least limit transmission, that's how it works with most vaccines, so that was the expectation always, and now enough time has passed and [studies are starting to come out showing they do](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-israel-vaccine-int-idUSKBN2AJ08J).

&gt;  
&gt;Really after two weeks, you start to have protection with the one shot, and we‚Äôve seen that in the clinical trials. Whereas with Pfizer it takes four weeks and Moderna it takes six weeks.

Is this actually correct though? Moderna did include data from their trial that showed 80+% efficacy after 14 days \[0\], and this has also been seen with pfizer in practice in the Israel vaccine rollout ""Two weeks ago, researchers in Israel reported that one dose of the Pfizer vaccine was 85% effective in preventing symptomatic disease 15 to 28 days after inoculation.""\[1\]. In less I'm wrong, the data seems to imply you should feel at least as good and protected 14 days after your first moderna or pfizer vaccine dose as you do after the J&amp;J. Sure you need to have the second shot of either of these to ensure that efficacy lasts - but it seems wrong to say that it starts later.

[],,_hello__reddit_,,,[],,,,text,t2_9fmrrt0j,False,False,[],"""The European Union will propose a certificate that could ease travel  for those who have taken EU-approved vaccines as well as others, like  the Chinese and Russian shots, that have only received emergency  national authorizations.

The ‚ÄúEU Covid Card/digital green certificate‚Äù will comprise  three documents that will specify if the holder has gotten a vaccine and  which one; the results of a coronavirus test if taken; and details on  whether they have recovered from a Covid-19 infection, according to a  person familiar with the European Commission‚Äôs draft regulation.

The EU is racing to develop a system that will allow the 27  member states, and those in the European Economic Area, to reopen their  doors to travel while also preventing an escalation in the spread of the  coronavirus. The bloc‚Äôs leaders unanimously agreed last month on a  broad outline for the vaccine certificates, which are a priority for  tourism dependent countries like Greece and Cyprus.

‚ÄúThe proposal aims to facilitate the exercise of the  right to free movement within the EU during the Covid-19 pandemic by  establishing a common framework for the issuance and acceptance of  interoperable certificates on Covid-19 vaccination, testing and  recovery,‚Äù according to the current draft, which is subject to change.

## Slow Rollout

The  vaccination pass would cover all shots that have been authorized by the  European Medicines Agency as well as those that have been granted  emergency authorization by individual countries, said the person, who  asked not to be identified because the process is private. Hungary for  one has already started inoculating its population with vaccines  manufactured in Russia and China.

The decision to include shots in the certificate that haven‚Äôt  received European authorization could prove controversial for some  member states who argue that the countries are using vaccines as  geopolitical propaganda tools. But it will avoid arguments and  restrictions for those countries that have given the shots their  approval.

The EU is struggling to boost its vaccination numbers, which  have fallen behind other regions. The bloc so far has given 9.4 shots  per 100 people, according to the Bloomberg [vaccine tracker](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/). That compares with more than 27 doses in the U.S. and more than 35 in the U.K.

The  commission, the EU‚Äôs executive arm, still maintains that it‚Äôs on track  to meet its target of vaccinating 70% of its adult population by the end  of the summer. The bloc also sees deliveries ramping up to as much as 100 million doses a month by the end of March.

## Tourist Season

The  new proposal aims to ensure that restrictions on free movement  currently in place to limit the pandemic can be lifted in a coordinated  manner. Details in the draft are likely to change ahead of publication,  said the person. The regulation will be published on March 17.

The  plan comes as several member states have started to weigh options for  their own vaccine passports in a bid to save their summer tourism  season.

‚ÄúTourists will be welcomed if before travel they‚Äôre either  vaccinated or have antibodies or have been tested negative,‚Äù Greece‚Äôs  Tourism Minister Haris Theoharis told ITB Berlin. ‚ÄúGreece is ready with a  complete protocol for summer 2021.‚Äù

The  aim of the proposed framework is to enable interoperability between  member states‚Äô vaccination and testing systems and to avoid the  introduction of unilateral measures that lead to border restrictions and  discrimination between EU citizens.

## Data Safety

The  draft makes clear that a vaccine certificate shouldn‚Äôt become a  pre-condition to exercise free movement nor is it an obligation to be  vaccinated.

Data  included in the certificates will not be centralized but would function  through a secure, decentralized verification system, according to the  draft. Information in the certificates would include a person‚Äôs name,  passport or identity card number, date of birth, the vaccine they have  taken and the number of doses administered. Similar data would be  collected for test results. Each certificate would have a unique  identifier.

The three certificates should be issued free of charge in a  digital or paper-based format, allowing ‚Äúprospective holders to request  and receive a paper copy of the certificate or to store and display the  certificate on a mobile device,‚Äù the draft states. ‚ÄúThe certificates  should contain an interoperable, digitally readable barcode or similar  means containing the relevant data relating to the certificates, and  should be used to securely verify the authenticity, integrity and  validity of such data,‚Äù the draft says.

Under the EU‚Äôs proposed plan, the framework would be in place temporarily until the pandemic is declared over.

Doses of the new, one-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine are arriving in Arizona, leaving many Arizonans asking if they should get it or one of the two-shot Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

The answer, health officials say, is get whichever is available to you when you become eligible, because they all protect against severe outcomes.

Some people are sure to still have preferences based on convenience, health or even religious reasons, because the three available vaccines are slightly different.

But the good news is researchers say all three are effective vaccines that prevent hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19.

China, as a country, reported to the WHO back in dec 2019, which is why it is called covid 19 even though the public was made aware of it in 2020. There was speculation on what caused the symptoms but it takes a few days for the lab to confirm it. You can't lockdown a province based on speculations, especially not during Chinese new year.

Basically, the genome houses thousands of genes as a long-term storage system. These genomes exist in (almost) every cell and are identical in each. However, the information stored in the genome is useless on its own. A great number of functional genes in the genome contain the code to make proteins. In order to get the information for making a protein from the genome to the ribosomes (where proteins are synthesized), the cells make a temporary copy of the genetic information in a more mobile form called messenger RNA (mRNA).  


mRNA is very unstable and doesn't last very long in the best of circumstances, but the cells produce additional molecules to break them down, just to make sure they don't linger around longer then they're needed. The mRNA has just enough time to get to the ribosome and the genetic code is translated into a functional protein.   


In the case of mRNA vaccines, like the ones made by Pfizer and Moderna, they use mRNA that codes for so-called spike proteins that exist on the exterior of the COVID-19 virus. These spike proteins are what get recognized by your immune system, which produces antibodies that bind to them and mark them for destruction. However, the spike proteins are harmless on their own.

&amp;#x200B;

So, the vaccine is a delivery system so the body can make boatloads of COVID-19 spike proteins based off the mRNA, teaching the immune system how to fight off the virus. The mRNA is then degraded in the cell.

&gt; While the current US distribution of vaccines is a
critical development in preventing and controlling
COVID-19, doses will be limited for the next
several months. Supply will likely remain limited
throughout some, if not all, of a B.1.1.7-related
surge. To date, approximately 43 million people
in the US have received at least one dose of
vaccine (CDC 2021e). Even with the nearly 84
million Americans who have had COVID-19
(CDC 2021b), we are far short from reaching a
herd immunity threshold, with an estimated 65%
of the US population remaining susceptible to
infection. To maintain healthcare capacity during
a B.1.1.7 surge, we have a time-limited period to
strategically target vaccination to those at highest
risk of hospitalization and death before the surge
arrives.

(1) The State notification system is a bit of a mess. It's not terrible given the sheer scale of distribution, but it could be tightened up. I am an educator, and hence in Tier 1B for our State, and was eligible since about 2 weeks ago, but appointments were never available in my county until quite recently, as they had a backlog of demand from Tier 1A recipients. I registered for notifications both on the state website, and through Kaiser (my insurer). I found, somewhat by accident, that I had to complete an e-visit on the Kaiser site to move me into a scheduling tier. Lo and behold, yesterday I get the email that I'm eligible to go in, same day and everything. Still haven't heard back from the .gov notification site, but moot at this point.

(2) I went to a big temporary clinic at our business expo, and things ran pretty smoothly. About 60 stations for administering vaccines (I got the Moderna), all they had to verify was my insurance card and my driver's license. No proof of employment as an educator was needed, maybe because it's in my insurer's records, or maybe because it's ultimately the honor system, not sure. I don't think I waited more than 5-10 minutes before I got poked, and then they have you chill out for 15 minutes in case of allergic reaction. No problems, drove home.

(3) Night of getting the vaccine and into today, I definitely had shoulder soreness in the muscle around the injection site. That happens to me all the time with flu shots, etc, so no biggie, maybe it's a little stronger, but not bad. I do have a sore back as well, but since I'm a side sleeper, I'm wondering if I just didn't sleep right because I couldn't comfortably roll onto my left shoulder. As far as side/after-effects go, seems pretty mild. My mental relief is definitely worth it, as I was not keen to get COVID.

Vaccine efficacy refers to how well it performs in a carefully controlled trial, whereas effectiveness describes its performance in the real world. A common mistake is to interpret a 95 percent efficacy to mean you have a 5 percent chance of getting sick even if you get vaccinated. That is not true at all. Efficacy is calculated based on trials that have an unvaccinated placebo control group, and at the end of the trial, they look at the number in the control group that ended up with symptomatic COVID to get the baseline infection rate. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, for instance, had 95 percent efficacy in its clinical trial. That number came from the fact that 162 people in the placebo group got symptomatic COVID, and eight people in the vaccinated group did; that is 170 cases total. Eight is approximately five percent of 170. That is essentially how efficacy is calculated. Most COVID vaccine clinical trials have reported efficacy in preventing any symptomatic disease, not necessarily severe disease; early data for the latter are promising, however.

&gt;  why would we assume that the rates won‚Äôt continue spiking? Should we be less confident that we are near the end?

&gt;Let me lay out the scenarios. You have people who say the next fourteen weeks are going to be the worst of the pandemic. There is a viewpoint out there that says every time you saw B.1.1.7 become the dominant strain, you saw not a twenty-per-cent increase in cases but a three- or four-hundred-per-cent increase. So, if that happens off a base of sixty thousand or seventy thousand cases a day, we are looking at several hundred thousand a day, which of course is horrible and may surpass our worst days. So that‚Äôs the concern a lot of public-health people bring up.

&gt;I think that is unlikely. I think you could see a bump, but I think that it will be much smaller, for two reasons. One is that we have a lot more population immunity and we are vaccinating people. And, second, seasonality. These spikes largely happened in countries during the holiday season. But even now, in Europe, in some countries, you are starting to see B.1.1.7 take off, and starting to see a real bump in cases. So that‚Äôs the concern.

&gt;So now the contradiction: Why am I so confident about middle to late April? I feel comfortable that we will not see a massive spike but, rather, a small-to-medium spike, because we keep vaccinating, vaccinating, vaccinating. And, by mid-April, we should have vaccinated all the high-risk people‚Äîwe should see hospitalizations plummeting, even if case numbers are somewhat high‚Äîand the most vulnerable people will be covered, so we should not see large numbers of infections by then. Some experts think I am being too optimistic.

I wouldn't say 'laughably inaccurate'.

And if you want to get into the nitty gritty, this isn't a 'plan', it's funding for vaccines, the highest amount of it (2.1 billion) going to a company that didn't produce a working vaccine, while two other companies are under investigation for exaggerated results and security fraud. The Pfizer vaccine wasn't funded through this either.

Take a pre 2020 pandemic plan, for instance the UK: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213717/dh_131040.pdf

And it‚Äôs pretty close to how I think it should have gone down. 

&gt; 4.18 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office will issue advice regarding travel to affected countries. There are no plans to attempt to close borders in the event of an influenza pandemic. The UK generally has a high level of international connectivity, and so is likely to be one of the earlier countries to receive infectious individuals. Modelling suggests that imposing a 90% restriction on all air travel to the UK at the point a pandemic emerges would only delay the peak of a pandemic wave by one to two weeks10,11. Even a 99.9% travel restriction might delay a pandemic wave by only two months. During 2009 it became clear that the pandemic virus had already spread widely before international authorities were alerted, suggesting that in any case the point of pandemic emergence had been missed by several weeks. The economic, political and social consequences of border closures would also be very substantial, including risks to the secure supply of food, pharmaceuticals and other supplies.

&gt; There is very limited evidence that restrictions on mass gatherings will have any significant effect on influenza virus transmission14. Large public gatherings or crowded events where people may be in close proximity are an important indicator of ‚Äònormality‚Äô and may help maintain public morale during a pandemic. The social and economic consequences of advising cancellation or postponement of large gatherings are likely to be considerable for event organisers, contributors and participants. There is also a lack of scientific evidence on the impact of internal travel restrictions on transmission and attempts to impose such restrictions would have wide-reaching implications for business and welfare.
4.22 For these reasons, the working presumption will be that Government will not impose any such restrictions. The emphasis will instead be on encouraging all those who have symptoms to follow the advice to stay at home and avoid spreading their illness. However, local organisers may decide to cancel or postpone events in a pandemic fearing economic loss through poor attendances, and the public themselves may decide not to mix in crowds, or use public transport if other options are available.

&gt; *7.4 During a pandemic, the Government will encourage those who are well to carry on with their normal daily lives for as long and as far as that is possible, whilst taking basic precautions to protect themselves from infection and lessen the risk of spreading influenza to others (see Chapter 4). The UK Government does not plan to close borders, stop mass gatherings or impose controls on public transport during any pandemic.*


And you‚Äôre gonna say, well this is for flu. That‚Äôs true, however, this is designed for pandemic flu, which can be extremely deadly, like 1918. Maybe it should have been modified slightly, but to me, the complete change from this document to the situation in the UK isn‚Äôt justified. As a example: this is what they said was possible in the 2011 report, and the 2011 report still didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúlock down society‚Äù 

&gt; Taking account of this, and the practicality of different levels of
 response, when planning for excess deaths, local planners should prepare to extend capacity
 on a precautionary but reasonably practicable basis, and aim to cope with a population
 mortality rate of up to **210,000 ‚Äì 315,000 additional deaths, possibly over as little as a 15 week
 period and perhaps half of these over three weeks at the height of the outbreak.**

This means that low risk young people who are more tech savvy are getting appts over older people in need. I saw a percentage distribution for the vaccine in Oregon and it was around 12% evenly distributed for all age groups.

You answered your own question there bud.

&gt;100% of traffic fatalities are preventable if we ban all cars and get rid of all the roads. Why don't we do that?

Man you sound just like conservatives through this entire event. They sad the same shit about wearing masks. ""if you're too scared to go out in public better not drive"" that's you right now. You know why I don't compare driving to infectious diseases? If you get into an accident you are not going to cause me to also crash car accidents aren't contagious neither is lyme disease for that matter. 

&gt; yes we collectively are willing to countenance a myriad of different things that create the risk of kids and other innocent people dying so that society can function and people can pursue their happiness. Welcome to real fucking life.

It is common knowledge that many of these wet markets in Asia have caused many different diseases and illnesses. If you know that and you go and purchase or sell items that could potentially make others sick, or have not been handled in a clean and sanitary way, then yes, you are at fault and part of the problem. So if the majority of the Chinese population is purchasing or selling these goods, knowing that they could be dangerous and have been in the past, then the majority of the Chinese population is part of the problem. People like to blame Americans in general for the American COVID spread, thus the Chinese in general should blamed for COVID itself, then, by that logic.

Obviously, there is no changing the fact that this has happened, however, there has not been any accountability taken, nor has there been changes made to these wet markets. Last I checked, the exact one that started all of this has completely reopened. This is a problem, and thus the Chinese government is disgusting and inhumane for allowing these things to continue to happen, and to continue to put millions of peoples lives at risk.

Any practice in any country that can be altered or stopped that causes infectious and deadly diseases should be altered or stopped immediately. This is not only true for certain areas of the world, but it applies to every single country. If the UK or the United States had common practices in place that knowingly put millions, if not more, lives at risk, then yes, I would say the United States, UK, or whatever government it is, is inhumane and disgusting for allowing that to happen.

If I were flying soon prior to vaccination I'd trade my fabric masks with filters for a properly fitted KN95 and do my best to avoid taking it off. Keep your distance in the airports like you would any other indoor location with crowds. Because of the way air is filtered on planes (it's happening above and below every seat and is running through HEPA filters at a crazy high rate compared to most indoor settings), if there's someone unmasked twenty rows ahead of you that's far less worrisome than if your neighbor is unmasked.

I've read articles quoting a head honcho at Moderna asserting that their shots (that is, getting both shots) provides immunity for 2 full years. tbh I think best practices will be annual boosters, similar to flu shots. and hopefully, at least one of the pharma companies will find a way to combine a flu shot with a COVID shot

&gt; I would really prefer more efforts by government and businesses

I hear that. But after the year we've all just had, I'm not sure what other message could somehow get through &amp; convince anti-vax people into getting vaxxed after all. like ""hey, you know that global pandemic that killed 520,000 Americans and fubar'ed the economy? This is how you protect yourself from it. And it's free! ... 'No thanks' you don't want it? What do you WANT to get Coronavirus, only with more certainty that it will be your own fault?""

&gt; offering employees education &amp; incentives to get vaccinated 

Again I see what you're saying. But then I've been on board with the vaccine from the beginning, got it as soon as I could, and now that I got the 2nd shot 2 weeks ago, I've got as much immunity as anyone.

For the ""24% who say they will NEVER get vaxxed if they have their way"" I don't think these efforts will bear much fruit. They are inclined to consider education as ""fake news, more govt lies to manipulate and control the public"". They will consider economic incentives as ""bribes to take the 5G microchip juice funded by **Bill Gates**""

&gt; ahead of USA on vaccine trials with kids so they can be vaccinated sooner

I figure the US pharma companies are also making progress on vaxxing-kids trials, just keeping it on the DL until summer. When the pharmas announce ""our vaccine is safe for kids as young as 6"", the lion's share of most school districts will require proof of COVID vaccination to enroll kids into school for the 21-22 academic year. And THAT will turn around the ""if we can help it"" part for many of the holdouts

&gt; pharma companies figure things are going to continue

Of course they're going to continue, it's still a novel virus and it will still screw people up who get it with no immunity, this year, next year, 2025, 2030 or whenever. I figure it will become rather like the annual flu shot -- $25 upfront if you aren't insured, or ""free"" when billed to your health insurer. (Which just means your insurer paid the $25, maybe $20 each since they can negotiate based on volume, and then the insurer gets it back out of your ins premiums)",,,1615308379,{},gqch30w,False,t3_m0v0uf,False,True,t1_gqb139e,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m0v0uf/a_quarter_of_americans_plan_to_say_no_to_covid/gqch30w/,1615310018,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The Biden administration walked in to NO plan for vaccine distribution and has spend most of the last 2 months snatching up and acquiring enough vaccine.

Trump stopped working the night he lost the election and the entire administration dumped every bit of asset management off on the states.

The Trump administration just so happened to exist at the same time as the vaccine was being developed they did nothing ""above and beyond"" the scope or necessity of the time.

&gt;**That's just not how vaccines and the immune system work.**

If you were anywhere close to right on either of those statements we would have had a vaccine against SARS or MERS.

The very incorrect assumption being made by many is that the human immune system reacts the same to human coronaviruses as other viruses.

Not only do the antibodies behave in a completely different fashion:

[https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/870592\_3](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/870592_3)

HCoV antibodies provide cross-reactivity to other HCoVs and while this might seem like a benefit it presented the greatest challenge:

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166354216304016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166354216304016)

There are years of mRNA HCoV vaccine studies that demonstrate the best T-cell reactivity is a first vaccine ""primer"", then a second first dose on week 3 and a third first dose on week 6.

The risk is not that immunity will not reach 92.6% after a single-dose on day 42, the risk is that immunity does reach 92.6% and the second dose is immunogenicity is nullified by existing immunities.  This is going to create such a dangerous expectation of immunity.

The 21-day schedule complements the full range of immunities in a population.  Deviating from this should only be done based on serological results.

Don't get me wrong I am sure some of these people work in a district that has shitty administrators, are most likely overworked and underpaid and having them return with little precaution or organization is wrong. Also some teach in a hybrid schedule that make it so one teacher teaches at same time in classroom and remote students at same time, which is lame. There is a funding issue with schools that made this worse on some districts..

Where my kids go there are specific remote and in person classrooms. The teachers who have a medical condition or are more at risk got priority on the remote spots, classes limited to 15 etc... this is how most districts where I live have worked the whole time. Most teachers and staff were eager to see kids again, many hated being forced out for their classrooms. 

But now most states have started or are done getting teachers and staff vaccines, we know that the protection work, the cases are going down drastically in most states etc... so the folks on that sub have no excuse left to want to stay remote into the next year. 

It doesn't matter how much the kids got wronged, they don't care about the kids on there, it s all the parents fault if their kids fail, even if they are sped, you re just a bad parent who had to become a teacher assistant with no qualifications over night and they don't care that you have a job or not...

Some just used the COVID19 pandemic to let out all their frustration they ve had onto parents (there are bad ones out there I am aware) but ultimately because they have shitty administrators.

If she had told me that in addition to this dose I'd have to come back for an appointment to get a second shot- As a healthy twenty something I could imagine myself not wanting to bother. But it was done in less than five minutes so I didn't consider it inconvenient at all.

Obviously this virus is a bit different from the seasonal flu, but I could imagine the Johnson and Johnson vaccine being what's best for people who really aren't scared of infection and don't care about going through the effort of getting a vaccine. It makes things much more logistically simple in areas of people where efficacy doesn't matter.

Hell, in an ideal scenario where every state in the country has millions of doses of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, I could imagine police officers or even some sort of national guard units going door to door in certain neighborhoods asking people if everyone home has received a shot yet, and if not- Whether or not they'd like a ""One dose and you're all set"" vaccine.

‚ÄúMask Safety and Effectiveness
Myth: Cloth masks don't protect you.
Fact: Cloth face masks are effective. They create a barrier between your mouth and nose and those around you. This makes it more difficult for the droplets that spread coronavirus through coughs, sneezes and talking to reach other people.
Cloth masks mainly keep you from unknowingly spreading the disease to others, but some studies indicate that they may help protect you from large droplets and serve as an indirect reminder to avoid touching your face. 
This is why wearing a cloth mask inside all retail stores and public transportation has been mandatory in Maryland since April 2020. And as more services such as getting a haircut or eating in a restaurant are being allowed, it is as important as ever to continue wearing a mask. We're all in this together.‚Äù

EDIT: Forgot [Mayo Clinic ](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-mask/art-20485449)

‚ÄúCloth masks

A cloth mask is intended to trap respiratory droplets that are released when the wearer talks, coughs or sneezes. It also acts as a barrier to protect the wearer from inhaling droplets released by others.

The most effective cloths masks are made of multiple layers of tightly woven fabric like cotton. A mask with layers will stop more droplets from getting through your mask or escaping from it.‚Äù",,,1615305748,{},gqc9wpm,False,t3_m136d0,False,True,t1_gqc301l,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m136d0/us_daily_death_toll_from_covid19_below_1000_for/gqc9wpm/,1615306618,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
