You are trying to evade the obvious - the primary benchmark for Sweden should be other Nordic countries.

the way they accounted for this difference was by removing the expected value for vaccinated indivuduals - I cant find the worst to explain it so I'll use an example with made up numbers

&amp;#x200B;

1 person who goes to the hospital bc of covid costs an average of $10,000

there were 100 people who went to the hospital with covid (100\* 10,000 = 1,000,000)

10 had the vaccine so remove 10\*10,000 = 100,000 (now at 900,000)

now...if all of those 90 people got vaccinated, 10% would have gone to the hopsital anyways (90\*.10 = 9) so from the 900,000 we subtract 9\*10,000 (90,000) from 900,000 and then we say that unvaccinated people cost the US $810,0000

Yes, a previous infection gives you a very solid immune response. You know what that infection can also give you? 2 weeks in bed with a ""moderate case"", hospitalization or death with a ""severe case"" and a good chance of still having symptoms for months after the acute phase ends.

I'd much rather get ""good"" immunity with a vaccine that is safe than get ""great"" immunity with an infection that is anything but safe.

My kids still suck at swimming though because we missed a lot of pool time the past two summers due to the pandemic so whenever we go I'm still keeping my eyes on them at all times if not actively swimming with them.

Oh wait, I mean I just shrug and leave them to it and whatever happens, happens. I forgot, parents don't care about pool safety at all, my bad.

There are ZERO vaccines we routinely give in US which are dosed similarly to the Pfizer schedule where we expect lasting immunity. The only exception is the shingles vaccine, but that's kind of unusual because it's a vaccine against a virus that's already dormant in your system, and pneumonia vaccine (pneumovax), but you already get a different kind of pneumonia vaccine as a baby. Let's break it down. 


HepB- doses at 0, 1, and 6 months 

Polio, H flu, Pneumonia (Prevnar) and DTP- four doses given between 2-18 months of age

Rotavirus- 3 doses from 2-6 months of age 

HepA- 2 doses 6 months apart

MMR- 2 doses several years apart

Varicella- 2 doses several years apart

Meningitis- 2 doses several years apart 

Tdap- several years after DTP with Td boosters every 10 years

HPV- doses at 0, 1, and 6 months 

Flu- yearly shots

Meningitis B is only one shot, but that's because we literally give it right before kids go off to dorms and expect the immunity to wane pretty quick- we just want to get them through dorm living. 

That's all the ones I can think of right now off the top of my head so I'm probably missing some. But the theme is clear. We don't expect lasting immunity for any vaccine on a schedule like Pfizer's (2 doses 3 weeks apart). A dose at 6 months just makes sense from everything we know about vaccine schedules.",,,,1631724581,,{},hcyx7ku,False,t3_porikc,False,False,t3_porikc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/porikc/pfizer_says_israel_data_shows_third_covid_shot/hcyx7ku/,1631833325.0,28,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

This is something the next generation of vaccines will try to mimic.

With that said, one vaccine shot seems to compound the natural immunity to the best immunity available right now.  So anyone with prior infection should get vaccinated too. Prof Crotty is/was discussing this issue on twitter just the other day.

As of now, it looks like the best immunity one can acquire 

1. Prior infection + at least 1 mRNA
2. adenovirus vector (J&amp;J or Oxford) followed by 1 mRNA (preferably Moderna)
3. 2 shots of Moderna
4. Pfizer
5. J&amp;J/Oxford etc

Prior infection induced immunity has a caveat, one has to actually go through the virus, and no one wants to be dealing with a deadly virus.

We aren‚Äôt rich but we‚Äôve got funds.  We bought a bunch of binexnow tests.  We are both vaccinated and have some vaccinated but vulnerable people we interact with regularly.  We both work out if the house around others full time.  No one around us wears masks.

She says she doesn‚Äôt care so long as she gets to use the swab first (lol).   If we double up we could both test ourselves basically twice a week just for kicks (or in response to a local uptick).  This would give us a heads up to not visit our in-laws.

[],,Pinewood74,,,[],,,,text,t2_b4npv,False,False,[],"&gt; What happens when you have an army that's all out in that span?

About 65% of the military is already vaccinated.

~~I don't know which vaccine the Army has available to them, but the Air Force has Moderna, so that's 28 days between shots.~~  It will be Pfizer since that one is approved.  Doesn't really change the logistics.

There's 14 weeks until the 15th.  There's 35% of the Army that needs to get shots (might be slightly different as that number is for the military and Army might be lower as the Marine Corps is).

It's two shots so you're looking at effectively 70% of the force (2 x 35%) being down for 2 days.  Those 14 weeks correspond to 70 business days.  So you can give a shot to 1% of the force each business day and you're looking at only ever being down 2% of your force. (and that's really only 2% down for 3 days of the week: Wed, Thurs, Fri)  That's not much and that's like being overly protective.  Most people can still do their jobs.  They can still come in and be at least somewhat productive.   And that's without bothering to stack shots on Friday.  If the Army is concerned about not having people do their jobs, they'll just make everyone sacrifice their weekend to the side effects and be in on Monday good to go.

My point is from the perspective of being worried about side effects taking your force down, 3 months is more than enough time.  They can compress that down much further and still not have issues.

There might be an issue from getting shots available, but that would be surprising.  It isn't like they (the military) didn't know this was coming, so they had weeks to secure the shots for the vaccine lines to get the shots done.",,,,1631715623,,{},hcybl6f,False,t3_pobcay,False,True,t1_hcwr8to,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pobcay/us_army_says_active_duty_soldiers_must_be/hcybl6f/,1631821391.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

1.1.1 Long-term effects on the pulmonary system during the path to recovery  
ACE2 receptor is expressed in bronchial epithelium and type II pneumocytes. These cells are the major alveolar surfactant producer with immunoregulatory functions besides their function as stem cell progenitors of type I pneumocytes. The most clinically manifested complication is acute hypoxaemia, requiring ventilators.3 The comparison to non-intensive care unit (ICU) and ICU admitted patients had higher levels of interleukin (IL-7), IL-10, GCSF, IP10 (CXCL10), MCP1 (CCL2), MIP1A (CCL3) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Œ±.3  
  
A recent retrospective study on 57 patients, the impact of COVID-19 on pulmonary function in the early convalescence phase was investigated.4 It collected the data 30 days after discharge and they reported that 54.3% had abnormal CT findings and 75.4% had an abnormal pulmonary function. Compared to the non-severe cases, severe infection cases showed diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) impairment (75.6% vs. 42.5%). They reported that in more than half of the COVID-19 patients there was an impaired diffusion capacity, lower muscle strength and lung imaging abnormalities.4  
  
A 3-month post-discharge study on critical COVID-19 patients who were admitted to ICU showed 55% of patients had impaired lung function, exhibiting restrictive patterns, altered DLCO, 65% of patients reported 6 min walking distance (6MWD) below 80%. The study also reported obstructive sleep apnoea as a predictor of fibrosis on a 3-month chest computed tomography (CT) scan.5  
  
Weerahandi et al.6 studied a post-discharge health status and symptoms in patients with severe COVID-19, their study was conducted 30‚Äì40 days post-discharge on 152 participants. About 74% of participants reported shortness of breath. Physical and mental health deterioration was also reported in the post-COVID-19 participants.  
  
In a study done on 55 COVID-19 survivors 3 months after recovery, it was reported that there were radiological (ground-glass opacity \[GGO\], consolidation and interstitial thickening) and physiological abnormalities in 70% of the patients. The measurements of D-dimers can be a potential marker for the prediction of impaired diffusion defect.7 For the patients with higher D-dimer, pulmonary rehabilitation as a management strategy with necessary follow-ups are recommended.  
  
A comprehensive multicentre clinical follow-up (clinical examination, laboratory testing, lung function analysis, electrocardiogram \[ECG\] and CT scans) evaluated 145 COVID-19 patients, 60 and 100 days after diagnosis. The group reported that 36% of patients reported dyspnoea, 21% reported reduced diffusion capacity and 41% of patients had symptoms 100 days after COVID-19 infection. Lung pathologies in 63% of patients were confirmed by CT scans, the majority of the patients had bilateral GGO and reticulation in the lower lung lobes. The study also concluded significant improvements in symptoms and cardiopulmonary conditions over time.8

Despite predilection of COVID-19 for lungs, multiple extra-pulmonary manifestations appear in multiple organs and biological systems and with continued infection and recovery worldwide.

[],,DiprivanDapper,,,[],,,,text,t2_97j1gss4,False,False,[],"I worked at the bedside as a critical care nurse in a Covid ICU from Jan 2020 to August 2021. I tend to just be a lurker because I don't usually feel like getting into internet arguments but nope...you're wrong. The study you referenced pulled data from approximately a month and a half early into the pandemic last year. 

So, to start the authors point out in the introduction that: ""Although experience with COVID-19 continues to grow, reported mortality rates range from 50 to 97% in those requiring mechanical ventilation (1‚Äì6)."" The areas cited in those articles were primarily in Washington state, New York, and China (because at that time that's where we had the most data from). The study you referenced pulled data from Atlanta: ""observational cohort study of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to six COVID-designated ICUs at three Emory Healthcare acute-care hospitals in Atlanta, Georgia, from March 6, 2020, to April 17, 2020."" The south wasn't as heavily impacted that early in the pandemic.

""There were no critical shortages in medications, ventilators, dialysis machines, or other critical care equipment."" This is a MAAASIVE thing to include in the methods section from the authors. Currently we are encountering a severe shortage of trained bedside nurses throughout the country as many of us are leaving bedside for various reasons (severe burnout being a primary one). In the beginning there wasn't a severe shortage of meds or equipment, but let me tell how how stressful it can be to try to manage an intubated and sedated patient with oral medications instead of IV fentanyl, propofol, and versed because there wasn't any available due to a national shortage (happened late last year during the second big wave in my region). One of my colleagues went to New York during their first big wave and told me they ran out of IV pumps for patients on some units so they had to hand calculate drip rates on medications (something we don't normally have to do outside of nursing school).

From my clinical experience I have seen steroids be useful and remdesevir at least didn't seem to do anything detrimental to my patients. Proning therapy was necessary in a lot of cases, but wasn't a guarantee. Some patients improved and were able to be successfully extubated, but once the case reached the point of requiring intubation, most patients did not survive. I have also seen many patients extubated and then subsequently decompensate and require re-intubation days later after being downgraded out of the ICU.

Long story short while some outcomes may have improved, there is no evidence (either that I have read or from my first hand experience) that the mortality rate is only 35.7% for intubated patients. Additionally, with things like this, the details make a big difference and you can't take a number like that from an outdated article that only applies to a very small subset of the general population and say it is representative of the whole (what you alluded to). I'm sorry, but this adds to misinformation and is dangerous when not explained and evaluated within proper contexts.

Manitoba went through this in the 3rd wave because they didn't react before it happened even though other provinces were going through the worst of the wave a month before them.

Finally.

In saying that, a vaccine is the best defence. The gargle and nasal spray may only be of assistance in episodes of confirmed acute exposure, possible reduction of disease severity and also possible reduction of onwards transmission by reducing th viral load in the upper respiratory tract. 

Povodine-iodine has been used for decades as a gargle for upper respiratory tract infections. Personally, I have used it for about a decade when I get a sore throat and it assists in preventing the infection creeping down into my lower respiratory tract. Prior to using it (recommended by specialist Drs) I would develop bronchitis several times a year. As it is,  cannot remember when I last had bronchitis.

[],,spencer8ab,,,[],,,,text,t2_4wmax,False,False,,"&gt;Unvaccinated people still make up 92% of covid hospitalizations.

This depends on when and where, and isn't a useful statistic to give without context. ""Still"" implies very recent data, and I don't think the recent percentages from July and August are that high.

A [CDC report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7037e1.htm) indeed has 92% of hospitalizations among the unvaccinated (really the not fully vaccinated, including those who missed a second dose). 

However, the CDC report includes two periods of observation, April 4‚ÄìJune 19 and June 20‚ÄìJuly 17, 2021. Most of the hospitalizations in the report were during the earlier period.

During the June 20-July 17 period, unvaccinated people made up 86% of hospitalizations. 

That CDC report cites a [COVID-NET preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.27.21262356v1.full-text) which explains

&gt;Our finding that a substantial and growing proportion of hospitalized persons were fully vaccinated is not surprising; the proportion of hospitalized cases who are fully vaccinated is expected to increase as population vaccination coverage increases. Given the high vaccination coverage, particularly in older age groups, which was more than 80% in July for those ‚â•65 years,2 the finding that 16% of hospitalized cases ‚â•18 years during that month were fully vaccinated is consistent with what we would expect from highly effective vaccines.

That data suggests that in July, about 84% of covid hospitalizations were among the unvaccinated.",,,,1631662903,,{},hcvwf6z,False,t3_pnxr8z,False,True,t1_hcvnr6b,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pnxr8z/daily_discussion_thread_september_14_2021/hcvwf6z/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,ff893ccfff836159c21c554ff00b80271159ee74,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1631662921.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Those magical monoclonal antibodies were in a neighboring city 20 miles away (which actually has a smaller population than our city.) Good luck driving there with COVID. My brother couldn't get there. Right now he's feeling like he can't get oxygen. 

He also thinks he has a 99.7% chance of surviving it because of the infection fatality rates per 100,000 you see trotted around everywhere. I haven't told him that number includes people who don't actually have COVID.  I had a ""doctor"" on a sub explain to me those rates are more important than case fatality rates because 'it picks up on those cases that are not counted for"" as if the wash of uninfected doesn't dilute the number. 

One of the reasons he didn't get vaccinated is ""I'm sure I had it last year"" in February, before we even knew there was a pandemic. Possible? Maybe. But he's very sick and has been for 2 1/2 weeks.

I have been looking to get the J &amp; J recently, but these past couple of days, I have been fairly sick. I got tested today for COVID and it came back negative, but being a college student, I believe what has been spreading around our campus like wildfire is RSV. I haven't gotten tested for that yet, but my symptoms match up perfectly, and dozens of people are getting sick with it on our campus, so I am 99% sure this is what it is given that tons of people have gotten strep throat tested as well and that has been coming back negative as well. My question is, how long should I wait to get vaccinated, or can it still be done right now? Does me having RSV now affect my response to the vaccine? Will it make the side effects worse?

&gt;LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) ‚Äî Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said Tuesday that the department will wait for instructions from city officials after it was reported that thousands of LAPD employees plan to use religious or medical exemptions for the city‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine mandate.

&gt;‚ÄúWe have seen a number of our personnel who have filed for an intent to have an exemption, based on either medical or sincerely held religious belief,‚Äù Moore told the Los Angeles Police Commission. ‚ÄúThe department will wait for the city to provide instructions relative to the interpretation and what will happen to those intentions to file.‚Äù

&gt;According to an internal memo sent to Mayor Eric Garcetti from the personnel department, 2,651 Los Angeles Police Department employees intend to seek religious exemptions and 368 plan to seek medical exemptions for the mandate requiring all city employees to get vaccinated.

&gt;Non-exempt employees must be fully vaccinated by Oct. 19, and exemptions will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Those who have exemptions must be tested for COVID-19 weekly.

&gt;As of Tuesday, just over 54% of department personnel, or 6,573 employees, have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, Moore said.

&gt;Of the department‚Äôs 12,315 employees, 3,102 have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic began, 66 of them within the last two weeks.

&gt;Meanwhile, only 48% of the city‚Äôs over 57,000 employees are fully vaccinated.

&gt;The personnel department reported that the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has 11,643 employees, 30% of which are fully vaccinated.

My local hospital has a grand total of 4 ICU beds.

Can you help me understand the CDC data you are relying on?  I clicked your link and for the most recent week I see this:

For the 0-4 age group, 2.2 cases per **100,000 population.**  That doesn't say ""per 100,000 **infections**,"" I notice.

Does that mean the CDC data is saying that of ALL children, 2.2 out of 100,000 get hospitalized?  In other words, is this ""the number hospitalized"" per ""the entire population of children in the US""?

If that is the case, that is the obvious difference from the AAP data.  The AAP's number report the NUMBER HOSPITALIZED PER THE NUMBER OF INFECTIONS.

If they are not so bad that they can get a bed in a already full hospital, it doesn't matter to them for some reason. So many intentional avoid talking about ""mild"" cases or long covid or infections and instead just bring up hospitalization even when you ask explicitly about infections in their AMAs. &gt;.&gt; 

At least the head of the WHO is upfront about why they oppose boosters: they want the shots redirected to those who do not have access to even first shots. I agree and would be perfectly fine with US officials doing that. What I do not like is when public health officials do things like say ""masks don't work"" because they hope that means those most in need of masks can get them. Even when doing so is also telling the 70+ crowd with comorbiddities that they don't need a mask either.

A comparable example is in choosing a verb for the word ""each"". ""Each"" is always treated like a singular noun and paired with a singular verb. Even if you're talking about 500 people, you would say ""each person **has** a hat"" and not ""each person **have** a hat"". You use the singular verb even though it's implied that you're talking about multiple people. This source goes into some detail on that.

What the heck does this even mean?

You just say crap because you know no one will ever call you on it here on reddit?

545B of that 2.6T was just direct COVID payments.

161B was SNAP.

61B was refundable EITC.

80B was refundable Child Tax Credits.

56B was SSI Payments.

17B was TANF

260B was expanded UI

Those are the numbers that I can readily and easily ID as direct payments to people.

That's 1.18T out of the $1.77T ""Other Welfare""

I'm not quite sure what $105B in ""U.S. Coronavirus Refundable Credits"" means.  Could mean that's the people who didn't get checks in the mail and filed their taxes and got the COVID relief money, but that number seems high, but that's another one to take a look at for direct payments to people.

I didn't include a number like $32B for ""Child Nutrition Programs"" even though I'm fairly confident the overwhelming majority of that number is going to public schools to pay for free or reduced price lunchs.

I also didn't include numbers like the 34B for ""Emergency Rental Assistance"" because I'm not exactly sure how that money went out.  Because I'm guessing if it went straight to landlords rather than being ""laundered"" through the tenants, you'd say that was being funneled into private pockets.

And then you've also got things like ""Payments to States for the Child Care and Development Block Grant"" where it's going to states, but obviously I don't know what is happening after that.

And I'm not exactly sure how you got to $2.6T.  There's not $900B to go with the $1.77T from ""Other welfare""  I had a thought that you were including all of Medicaid and then just Part A and Part C of Medicare, but that adds up to $2.8T.

Does the $148B from DI (sub under Social Security) fit into all that?  Because that's some more direct payments to people, but if you included that, but not Social Security, I'm not exactly sure how you're defining ""Welfare.""

So, I guess it's plain to see that nowhere near ""All"" is being ""funneled into private pockets.""  It's probably most of that $2.6T is going straight to people, but if not there's definitely a good portion of that going straight to people.",,,,1631724105,,{},hcyw1mz,False,t3_po5bfk,False,True,t1_hcvtm3h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/po5bfk/us_spent_57_billion_for_treating_unvaccinated/hcyw1mz/,1631832715.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

I can't state enough how much I hate this argument as it relates to boosters being ""unnecessary"", which is basically what the WHO and part of the scientific community are pushing down our throats.

Less infections in everyone means less transmission.  All of this means less sick people, less long COVID, less death, etc in **EVERYONE**.  Vaccinated, unvaccinated, younger or old.

If they want to withhold boosters because they are hell bent that every single one would otherwise end up as a first shot in Africa.  Fine, be honest about it.  Don't facking blow smoke up my bunghole.

Lastly I am still waiting for someone to tell me the truth.  Would every otherwise-would-be-booster end up as a first shot in someone's arm in the developing world?

These individuals all from all over (mainly the south) literally couldn't do basic math, they still thought reading was for losers, believed in creationism, had no general history knowledge.....etc you get the picture. 

Idk how you even reform that, these people were below a 5th grader where I came from. 

However your comment rings true for my highschooling all it was is SAT prep college prep. More time on test scores than learning. Probably why I hated it. 

Anywho got out went to college and got educated, love learning now.

Here's where I disagree (emphasis mine):

&gt;It's an *informed and unified* citizenry acting in the public good for the benefit of all. It really isn't that hard of an idea, and *isn't that hard to accomplish*.

If it were easy to accomplish or otherwise a natural game-theory equilibrium, every country would be seeing these results regardless of leadership. The mere fact that these vaccination rates are headline-worthy elucidates my point that this is outlier behaviour and should be studied so that we can better replicate it.

Perhaps, as you seem to suggest/favor, this can be attributed largely to executive governmental leadership. To me, that seems highly unlikely, and I think that probably discards a lot of useful nuance that we can study and hopefully replicate in areas with worse vaccine adoption. One thing is certain to me: I don't for a second believe that Irish people are born with an innate predilection towards vaccinations. So the question then becomes: what messaging happened along the way to ""inform"" them so that vaccination was the obvious logical choice.

They lied to the public about masks in the early part of the pandemic. Even back then, I was baffled why we weren't wearing masks. Even if the virus was droplet-based (it's not), we had to wear masks when dealing with droplet-based viruses in the hospital.

They lied to the public about the virus being airbone. The six feet nonsense is a false security. Kind of like hand sanitizers. Don't touch your face, keep six feet apart, etc. All nonsense. Anything short of an N95 is not going to provide adequate protection against an airborne disease. That's why we had to wear N95s when going into a Tuberculosis patient's room. 

They told the public that they no longer needed to wear masks if they're vaccinated. Really? What did that accomplish? Now, we have millions of idiots that will NEVER wear masks again to prevent spread. Great job!

Now, they're telling the public that boosters may not be necessary. Really? How does that explain the data out of Israel?

For the first time in months, Floridians could learn Tuesday just how deadly the newest COVID wave has been in their communities, including a brutal toll in South Florida.

Some 2,900 people succumbed to the coronavirus in South Florida during the 99 days between June 5 and Sept 12 ‚Äî an average of 29 every day, according to a report released Tuesday, the first county-by-county breakdown since the state clamped down on the information in June.

The deaths included 631 people in Palm Beach County, 1,011 in Broward and 1,258 in Miami Dade. The tri-county area accounted for about a quarter of the 11,799 deaths statewide during the summer, according to the report.

Northern and Central Florida ‚Äî with lower vaccination rates ‚Äî may have been hit even harder, based on population.

For example, 514 people died for every 1 million residents in Broward County, the highest rate among Florida‚Äôs large counties, the report shows. But the smaller Brevard and Duval counties had more than 800 deaths per 1 million residents.


The Florida Department of Health had reported county death tolls each day throughout the pandemic, before switching to weekly reporting in early June after saying the COVID-19 crisis had abated. But the state never reported the data again once case counts surged over the summer.

The state has been detailing new cases and vaccination rates by county in its weekly COVID situation report on Fridays, but it does not include local deaths, only a statewide total. Until now, federal websites reflected incomplete death information for Florida‚Äôs counties as well.

The state‚Äôs secrecy made it nearly impossible to learn the local effect of the worst wave of the pandemic.

When the agency stopped sharing the data, public health experts expressed concern, arguing that local-level pandemic information helps Floridians make better daily life decisions about wearing masks, social distancing and attending events.

Health officials did not explain Tuesday why they made the information available after months of requests from the media and county leaders.

Dr. Jason Salemi, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of South Florida, tracks COVID-19 in Florida and discovered the release of the county-level death data on Tuesday. He said he believes the information represents a reliable representation of new deaths. ‚ÄúMy hope is that the information will be updated on a routine basis now,‚Äù he said.

Although new cases have been declining, Florida‚Äôs COVID death count has continued to rise. Experts believe it could level off by the end of the month.

Similarly like the article, we know that delta ran its course through India first.  We know their own vaccine supplies were still low then.  India was able to keep a foothold on their initial outbreak regardless, until the prime minister reassured the country, 'hey we beat it, you can gather again.'   It was around after the first wave.

per the article 'California cases are dropping'. Depending on the '*why*' the public response would be different.

Unlike india when delta hit, for those who wanted the vaccine in the US, it was already available (or at least suppose to be in Cali) Therefore I wondered, which it leaned towards.  *""Delta cases are dropping because everyone's immune system or vacc is working?""* as opposed to *""Delta cases are dropping because the most vulnerable have been wiped off quicker like in initial india?""*",,,,1631669489,,{},hcwaq0t,False,t3_poaqm4,False,True,t1_hcvv3vp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/poaqm4/california_coronavirus_cases_dropping_cdc_says/hcwaq0t/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,23a37f1d43f7360aa21da97c430420f95780d326,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1631669505.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

I've always felt this was an **incredibly** stupid (though probably disengenuous) thing for covid deniers / anti-whatevers to cite as a blanket dismissal of scientific consensus. To put it in terms they might better understand...

In the Covidball Pro League of Covid vs Humans, the mask / vaxx teams adapt their plays in response to the evolving plays of Covid and have [mostly figured out how to win](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/pnrsq8/vaccine_statistics_mic_drop/) their games after some early losses.

The anti-mask / vaxx teams are basically [forefeiting their games](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/po3rpm/covid_hospitalizations_hit_crisis_levels_in/) because it turns out having only a single passive game plan isn't viable for serious League play.

Whether we like it or not, whether we want to acknowledge it or not, we are all stuck playing in the goddamn Covidball Pro League. We are all in this game.

[],,Molire,,,[],,,,text,t2_174cr0,False,True,[],"&gt;Sept. 14 (UPI) -- Immunity from the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine lasts at least six months, and there is no indication that fully vaccinated people will need a booster shot, a small study published Tuesday by [Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj9853 ""https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj9853"") found.  
      
&gt;The vaccine also appears to produce long-lasting protection against the coronavirus in people of all ages, including those 70 and older who are at higher risk for serious illness, the data showed.   
       
&gt;The findings are based on an analysis of 35 people enrolled in early clinical trials of the vaccine, who received a low-dose version that is equivalent to one-quarter of the 100-microgram dose now given, the researchers said.  
           
&gt;Clinical trials conducted with patients who received the full dose of the Moderna vaccine found that the shot offered 93% protection against severe illness for at least six months, according to [data](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-financial ""https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-financial"") released by the company.  
           
&gt;Although the Moderna vaccine, as well as those from Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer-BioNTech, lower the risk for serious illness, even with the [more dangerous Delta variant](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2021/09/10/COVID-19-vaccination-reduced-risk-cdc/4271631297680/ ""https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2021/09/10/COVID-19-vaccination-reduced-risk-cdc/4271631297680/""), they may be less effective, and immunity could begin to weaken in [as little as four months](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2021/08/24/coronavirus-vaccines-efficacy-delta-variant-CDC/6021629826082/ ""https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2021/08/24/coronavirus-vaccines-efficacy-delta-variant-CDC/6021629826082/""), studies show.  
         
&gt;Most of the 35 patients included in the analysis continued to have high antibody responses six months after being fully vaccinated, according to the researchers.  
              
&gt;That six-month timeframe is sufficient for the body to produce ""immune memory"" against COVID-19, meaning the protection offered by the vaccine could last much longer, the researchers said.   
             
&gt;This suggests that booster shots, which have been a source of [controversy](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2021/09/03/Experts-urge-slowdown-on-COVID-19-vaccine-booster-shots/2821630673348/ ""https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2021/09/03/Experts-urge-slowdown-on-COVID-19-vaccine-booster-shots/2821630673348/"") given vaccine shortages in some parts of the world, may not be needed with the Moderna vaccine, particularly at the full dose, they said.  
       
&gt;It also appears to boost the immune response created by the common cold, which also is caused by a coronavirus, further strengthening protection, according to the researchers.  
     
&gt;However, the study did not show that a lower dose of the Moderna vaccine provides the same protection as the standard dose, as to do so would require a clinical trial.",,,,1631683440,,{},hcx13q1,True,t3_pojsw4,False,False,t3_pojsw4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pojsw4/study_moderna_covid19_immunity_lasts_6_months/hcx13q1/,1631795766.0,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

Field hospitals are carrying out a number of therapies and methods to improve their treatment efficacy.    
  
At the Ph√∫ Nhu·∫≠n COVID treatment field hospital No 1 at a high school in Ph√∫ Nhu·∫≠n District, patients are treated using a regime called 4T- tinh th·∫ßn (improvement of mental health), t·∫≠p luy·ªán (doing physical exercises), th·ª©c ƒÉn (nutritious meals), and thu·ªëc (medicine).  
  
Its patients are all moderately ill but face a high risk of worsening because many of them are old and have underlying medical conditions.  
They do physical exercises twice a day, in the morning and afternoon.  
  
Dr Tr·∫ßn Minh Quang of the HCM City Traditional Medicine Institute, which manages the hospital, said: ‚ÄúRegular physical exercises help strengthen patients‚Äô health and boost their immune system. Patients also do exercises to strengthen their respiratory muscles including the diaphragm, the rib cage muscles and the abdominal muscles.  
  
‚ÄúWhen these muscles are strengthened, they help enhance a patient‚Äôs breathing.  
  
‚ÄúMoreover, exercises help increase the blood circulation. This helps in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.‚Äù  
  
The patients also get encouragement and detailed explanations about their disease status to mitigate their anxiety since mental well-being helps them recover rapidly, he added.     
Patients at field hospital No 8, especially those with underlying medical conditions and seniors, are closely monitored to ensure they are treated in time if their disease worsens.  
  
They are given the hospital‚Äôs hotline and added to its zalo group to ensure they get immediate assistance if their condition becomes worse.  
  
Dr L√™ Ho√†ng VƒÉn of the hospital said, ‚ÄúUsing these methods, the hospital‚Äôs doctors detect early which patients are at high risk of becoming worse and provide emergency aid in time.‚Äù  
  
The hospital also has psychologists and counsellors to help mitigate the anxiety felt by patients and their relatives.  
  
The Th·ªß ƒê·ª©c city COVID-19 Resuscitation Hospital, which admits severe patients, said providing early emergency treatment to patients whose condition worsens before being brought in it helps decrease the risk of death.  
  
It has helped reduce the rate of fatalities from 39.8 per cent in July to 26 per cent in August, the hospital said.    
  
The Department of Health has been increasing the supply of ventilators, dialysis machines, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO) machines, X-ray machines, PCR testing systems, beds with oxygen systems, and other medical equipment to COVID treatment facilities.  
  
It has set up a team to efficiently transfer patients in severe condition from field hospitals to treatment facilities.  
  
The city has 191 quarantine facilities with 35,369 beds to treat patients who cannot be left at home, 81 hospitals for moderately sick patients and 10 hospitals to treat the most severe cases.  
  
Ten private hospitals are also treating patients.  
  
Speaking at a meeting of the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control, Minister of Health Nguy·ªÖn Thanh Long said the city has seen a significant decrease in new cases and deaths, pointing out that the number of deaths last week was down by 30 per cent.    
  
Ministry statistics show that 200 people died on September 12 compared to 340 on August 22.    
  
The Department of Health expects the number of discharged patients to be equal to or higher than the number of those hospitalised in the coming time. ‚Äî VNS",,,,1631717728,,{},hcygkfa,True,t3_porph5,False,False,t3_porph5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/porph5/hcm_city_sees_decrease_in_covid_fatalities_thanks/hcygkfa/,1631824221.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

The city's districts and communes have enough health workers, medicines, oxygen cylinders, and generators to efficiently treat patients at home.    
  
After two weeks of getting treatment at home, five people belonging to a family in District 12 recovered.  
  
N.H, 24, one of them, said: ‚ÄúMy uncle was found to have COVID through mass testing at T√¢n Ch√°nh Hi·ªáp Ward where my family lives. Because his infection was mild, he was treated and isolated at home. Ward health officials delivered medicines to him immediately.‚Äù  
  
A few days later she suffered from anosmia, or loss of smell, and tested positive herself.  
  
And then three more people in the family tested positive. But they too had mild symptoms and were treated at home.    
  
‚ÄúAt first we were anxious. But after getting detailed advice about the disease‚Äôs progress, how to treat it and what to do to help recover quickly from the ward health officials, the anxiety went away. They called us to ask about our health every two or three days.‚Äù  
  
H.P, 28, of B√¨nh Th·∫°nh District also is also being treated at home because of her mild condition. She received medicines from local health officials and told how to use them.  
  
‚ÄúI felt assured about being treated at home,‚Äù she said.  
  
P is among 92,355 COVID patients being treated at home as of September 4, according to the city Centre for Diseases Control and Prevention (HCDC).  
  
The city administration has set up 520 mobile medical stations to monitor the condition of COVID patients treated at home.  
  
The patients are provided with sufficient medicines and a hotline to local health officials, the HCDC said.     
  
Speaking at press meeting on September 8, Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu H∆∞ng, deputy head of the city Department of Health, said more than 130,000 packs containing fever medicines, vitamins and anti-inflammatory drugs have been provided to local health stations.      
  
Besides, more than 7,980 packs of the antiviral drug molnupiravir have been given to COVID patients, he said.  
  
The department has petitioned the city People‚Äôs Committee to provide another 200,000 packs, he added.  
  
Nguy·ªÖn Tr·∫ßn B√¨nh, vice chairman of the District 11 People‚Äôs Committee, said besides the medicines provided by the department, the district‚Äôs 34 mobile medical stations which monitor 6,645 COVID patients at home also got donations of medicines and now have enough.  
  
‚ÄúThrough the mobile medical stations, patients get medicines quickly.‚Äù  
  
They also have enough doctors to monitor patients now unlike in the past after being provided more by the Military Medical Department.      
  
‚ÄúEffective treatment of COVID-19 patients at home helps prevent the disease from worsening. The district has seen a reduction in the transfer of patients to hospitals.‚Äù

The vaccines were given to 13 districts in Long Bi√™n, ƒê·ªëng ƒêa, B·∫Øc T·ª´ Li√™m, Nam T·ª´ Li√™m, S√≥c S∆°n, Qu·ªëc Oai, Th∆∞·ªùng T√≠n, Ph√∫ Xuy√™n, Thanh Oai, ·ª®ng H√≤a, S∆°n T√¢y, ƒêan Ph∆∞·ª£ng and Ph√∫c Th·ªç.

The rate of adults receiving the first dose was 117.02 per cent, which was higher than expected because a number of people in HCM City did not have official residential registration books.      
  
Currently, all districts have basically completed the first dose in the vaccination campaign.  
  
HCM City has three localities that reached 100 per cent coverage of the first dose including C·ªß Chi and Ph√∫ Nhu·∫≠n districts, and Th·ªß ƒê·ª©c City.  
  
All districts have been implementing the second injection, of which C·∫ßn Gi·ªù District was currently leading with the rate 36 per cent of adults vaccinated.  
  
In order to achieve herd immunity soon, HCM City has been pushing up the vaccination campaign with the goal of injecting the first shot for all people aged 18 and over, and the 2nd shot on time for those who already got the first shot by September 15.

*I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God.*  
  
*I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick.*  
  
*I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure.*  
  
*I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.*

I do not know any doctors/nurses that want to be ever put into the situation where they refuse to help a suffering human being regardless if their suffering is caused by themselves. Doing that we can stop treating drug addicts, antivaxxers, but then we must expand  that a bit further and we stop treating obese people also, smokers, mountain bikers, boxers, climbers, annoying people who got into a fight, people who do not eat healthy and exercise. Once we step on that road it gets really hard to know where the line should always be and the doctors and nurses that I know could never be there on the sidelines and watch someone get critical and potentially die.

I think that none here disagrees that the boy in this story should have gotten treatment and part of the reason he did not get it is because there was a lot of people in there that were taking medical resources by the fault of their own.",,,,1631718655,,{},hcyirbk,False,t3_poqczw,False,True,t1_hcyfkco,/r/Coronavirus/comments/poqczw/a_boy_went_to_a_covidswamped_er_he_waited_for/hcyirbk/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,460c9d22703c70dbe2301840757c926dfbea4f43,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1631718671.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

People see ""larger dose, that must be it!"" or ""it was spaced out X number of days vs Y number of days, that must be it!"".  The reality is they went through phase trials where they did in fact experiment with doses (and maybe how they should be spaced, I don't know).  Both companies picked what seemed most appropriate.

When it comes to the booster dose being 1/2 of the original, these scientists aren't dumb motherfornicators.  They have a reason for making it so.  Administering a third dose is different than first, or second.  The system is primed and it's quite possible it reacts differently as such.  They also need to mitigate side effects.  What good is a vaccine if no one wants to take it?  It was well documented that Pfizer's was easier to tolerate.

Anyway I personally find these sort of posts not only na√Øve but insulting to the people that are saving our asses.

According to the US Census Bureau, the US population as of April 2020 was 331.4 million.

I think it's safe to say it is much higher than 1:500 given that they're sticking with using the very suspect official death count. 

[This article from back in May](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/07/world/coronavirus-newsletter-intl-05-07-21/index.html), also from CNN to be fair and use their own reporting, talks about the number crunching at Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.

&gt;At 574,000 deaths, the United States has reported more Covid-19 causalities than any other country. But the IHME report estimates the US death toll at more than 905,000 people -- around 58% higher.

Which is exactly why I went ""Hmmmm"" when I read the headline above. Based on everything I've been reading over the pandemic if you asked me what my guesstimate for the ratio would be more like 1 out of 300. If you include people dying of things like cancer they didn't get treated or inability to get emergency medical care because the hospital was drowning in COVID patients... it might even be more like 1 in 275 or more.

Here is one for Florida, but it only covers March to September 2020: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33600247/

The other thing you have to realize is that not only do the official Covid death totals underestimate the actual mortality, excess death measures also underestimate Covid mortality. 

Why? Take a look at this graph:

https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/60aeb2afeeeca895a8646d0c/Pediatric-deaths-from-influenza-in-the-US--2017-2021-/960x0.gif

This shows pediatric mortality due to influenza, which has disappeared in 2020 and so far in 2021.  Other sources of mortality also decreased, while a smaller number of causes of death increased.  So even excess deaths probably underestimates true Covid mortality. 

The IHME models account for all of these things and are informative. See here:

It could be that they end up recommending everyone 50+ to take a booster and keep the younger population at 2 doses, or maybe it will be generally decided that everyone should take a third dose.  Who knows - the science is not settled yet.  The point is that pushing dogma when things are still up in the air only fuels the anti-vaxx movement.  As someone in the young age bracket, with little to no personal risk involved with catching covid, and yet having received 2 vaccines regardless, I would not hesitate at all in signing up for the booster once the FDA deems it appropriate.  However, presenting half-truths as undeniable truths only perpetuates vaccine hesitancy and will keep us in this mess longer than we have to be.",,,,1631727845,,{},hcz55h1,False,t3_poqczw,False,True,t1_hcz1l88,/r/Coronavirus/comments/poqczw/a_boy_went_to_a_covidswamped_er_he_waited_for/hcz55h1/,1631837548.0,-2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

-A very large study recently discussed by the CDC found for the most recent time period, protection against severe disease was 87% for everybody, but only 80% for 60+. Other age stratified data sources back this up. You can quibble about the need for the young and healthy, but that the elderly are worse off and need them is unequivocal and should have started last month.

-I think we're at the point where people have made up their minds. The only things that will have much impact is mandates. I'd also fundamentally disagree that sacrificing optimal protection for people who *want* vaccines is an acceptable tradeoff for getting the hesitant vaccinated even in principle.

-First, I think it's important to quantify just how substantial the benefit to the rest of the world could be. Few people arguing about the ethics address this. Currently, Pfizer and Moderna combined are producing 300m doses per month. So the highest theoretical benefit is a 2-3 week difference if we skipped them, less if we did them only for the elderly/at risk, I'm comfortable that we're doing so much already forgoing boosters is not required by the ethics, on the same grounds we're not spending 10000x as much on foreign aid in general.

-Less than one might think, especially for the 2-3 weeks we're talking about. Allowing immunity to wane like this allows so many breakthroughs to build full viral loads in people with vaccine antibodies, creating selective pressure and opportunity *specifically for vaccine escape*, as opposed to the pure spread efficiency in an unvaccinated population. Nobody has quantified just how much of a problem this might be, but it is a concern, and since it's only 2-3 weeks anyway, I don't think our own country is better off refusing boosters, and the benefit globally is marginal.",,,,1631729792,,{},hcz9w26,False,t3_porikc,False,False,t1_hcyol09,/r/Coronavirus/comments/porikc/pfizer_says_israel_data_shows_third_covid_shot/hcz9w26/,1631840047.0,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

I had a friend who was hesitant, because he heard some of the misinformation. He was also scared of some of the stuff that wasn't misinfo, like the myocarditus, blood clots, etc. A few people really have died as a result of the vaccine. Now obviously, with the amount of harm that's been done by the virus, the correct risk assessment is pretty clear. Get vaccinated. He knew this, but those alarm bells were ringing in his head, and it's hard to turn those off. 

He expressed this to me via text. He's a very good friend of mine, so I didn't want to get too confrontational about it, but I definitely had moments where I wanted to fly my newly unafraid of airplanes due to the vaccine ass out to where he was and smack him. I didn't express that though. I calmly told him all the stuff he already knew about how the vax was the way to go. It took him a while, but he sought more advise and more info and came to the right conclusion. He's two weeks past his second dose as of a few days ago.

It made me realize though... if he had been a stranger, or someone I was fine with getting confrontational with, I WOULD have jumped down his throat the moment he expressed doubt... That probably wouldn't have worked. He might not have gotten vaccinated. When confronted like that, people dig in their heels.

[],,MavetheGreat,,,[],,,,text,t2_xjeet,False,False,[],"The estimate made in your link is more like COVID impact, not COVID deaths. This is an interesting and worthwhile conversation, but it isn't a direct correlary to dying of COVID.  

The case for the **overestimate** of deaths is states like [Oregon](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/BIRTHDEATHCERTIFICATES/VITALSTATISTICS/DEATH/Pages/reporting-covid-deaths.aspx) and California a COVID death as:

&gt;The death is of a confirmed or probable COVID-19 case within 60 days of the earliest available date among exposure to a confirmed case, onset of symptoms, or date of specimen collection for the first positive test; or  
&gt;  
&gt;The death results from any cause in a hospitalized person during admission or in the 60 days following discharge AND a COVID-19-positive laboratory diagnostic test at any time since14 days prior to hospitalization; or  
&gt;  
&gt;The death is of someone with a COVID-19-specific ICD-10 code listed as a primary or contributing cause of death on a death certificate, regardless of the dates of diagnosis or death.

[This news article interviewed an Oregon health official a year ago](https://www.ksby.com/news/coronavirus/health-officials-explain-what-determines-a-covid-19-death) and Oregon's definition has not changed.

The example cited in the news article from Oregon about a car crash where someone had tested positive for COVID a week before dying in a car crash is eyebrow raising because it's a preposterous process, and also because it's very unlikely.  However, the unlikelihood of that example reveals the possibility that it would happen with any other cause of death that included hospitalization.   
And you don't have to consider how unlikely any one cause of death is, you just have to consider the chance that the person would simultaneously test positive to see how this can inflate the numbers.

Some 37,000 people died in Oregon in 2019, theoretically none of them died of COVID.  But in 2021 if those people also tested positive for COVID within 14 days of their death, they would be a COVID death regardless of whether or not COVID played a role (and in fact, we may not have known if it did or not)

[At the start of the month, Oregon surpassed 3,000 COVID deaths](https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2021/08/oregon-surpasses-3000-covid-19-deaths-as-cases-continue-to-climb.html) (it seems since the start of the pandemic).  If just 1% of the state's deaths are over-aggressive in listing COVID, that would amount to a 10% over-reporting of COVID deaths in the state (actuall.  I don't *know* that that happened, and I'm not trying to allege conspiracy, just to point out that it may happen with our current system

California has gotten better at it this summer \[[1](https://covid19.sccgov.org/news-releases/pr-07-02-2021-SCC-refines-criteria-for-identification-of-covid-19-deaths)\] \[[2](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/california-county-cuts-its-covid-death-toll-by-25percent-after-adjusting-reporting-criteria/ar-AAKLE7r)\]

I didn't do the research for all 50 states.  Cynically, I would guess they don't count deaths as aggressively in states that are trying to diminish the severity of the pandemic.

I'm not saying this is wrong by the way, we haven't been as interested in identifying the impact of a disease in a long time, so we are being VERY aggressive in being sure we have it captured.  But that being said, it's likely to affect the mortality rate, particularly in states with this kind of aggressive criteria.  

A footnote, we also must be aware that this is in fact a drastic change from how we have counted deaths due to influenza in previous years, so comparing the mortality rate of the two diseases requires quite a bit of adjustment.",,,,1631726299,,{},hcz1dwd,False,t3_pon2pe,False,False,t1_hcyixaf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pon2pe/1_in_500_us_residents_has_died_of_covid19/hcz1dwd/,1631835565.0,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

One the other hand, if every other person you saw (i.e. 50%) was vaccinated, the impact would be much less horrific.


In other words, I think you're both right. It isn't as simple as it is made out to be and we should all be cognizant of that when we are seeing articles that boil things down to a single data point. In this case you'd have to also look into the population density of the state and how the social groups interact.

Don't confuse absence of evidence as evidence of absence. Calling doctors ""random whackos"" is an ad hominem attack. If your concern is that off-label use is dangerous, I'm not sure that research has been done yet. It is an FDA approved drug, and when prescribed by a licensed physician at appropriate doses we should not assume we know better. 

For example, Vitamin D supplementation remains unproven as a way to reduce hospital stay duration - but a doctor who recommends this to a patient, while considering it's safety concerns, may have justification.

Grocery shopping? Well I'm not eating or drinking while doing that anyway.

Eating out? My favorite restaurants all have covered oytdoor seating at this point.

Hanging out with friends in backyard or in their house? Well we won't be hanging out if they are sick and they are all vaxxed for covid anyway. So not masking here.

Outdoor shows or other oytdoor activities like horseback riding that I do on the regular? I'm not worried about getting sick from outdoor situations. I have never gotten sick from someone at the barn, and most oytdoor shows are held not during flu season.

The once a month in person meeting for work? I work for the state and we are required to be vaxxed. Still, I'll wear my mask in case anyone has cold/flu.

Biontech has mrna flu and cold vaccines in the pipeline. So likely will see some majorly effective vaccines coming available in the next couple of years.

It's also really not many situations that I'll be wearing masks in. So yeah, I'll keep wearing masks. But to say ""for the rest of my life"" is a pretty major exaggeration for most people.

[],,DiprivanDapper,,,[],,,,text,t2_97j1gss4,False,False,[],"Due respect, you're being lambasted because of the implication of your cited article. It is outdated and not relevant to current covid-19 cases. Delta is the dominant strain, not the wild type that was primarily present early last year.

u/acorns50728 stated ""Vast majority of covid delta patients die after being put on vent - things I read from r/nursing""

Your response: ""Actual number is closer to 35%, but OK""

The implication: covid-19 delta variant patients that are intubated have approximately a 35% mortality rate.

It suggests a narrative that may have once held water over a year and a half ago with a different strain of covid, but so much has changed between interventions utilized and the predominant variant that it is no longer an applicable article to cite when discussing current cases of delta.

If you want to not be lambasted in the future, may I offer a rephrasing:

""I read an article in Critical Care Medicine (peer-reviewed journal) that found of the 165 patients requiring intubation for the month and a half evaluated, the mortality rate was reported at 35.7 percent (n=56). Granted this was last March - mid April, but could this still be relevant with the current strains?""

Secondly, did I say ""vast majority""? No. I said most of my intubated patients that were cared for in my ICU from my experience. It is expert experience, but only one data point. The purpose behind me mentioning it was that my aggregate expert experience contradicts that article's month and a half. 

""However, the implication, based on conjecture, is that \~80%+ (or whatever you interpret the ""vast majority"" as)"". While it is fair to point out that I don't have hard numbers to support my claim, tossing out ""\~80%+"" is kind of along the lines of the concerns with your sourcing of the above article. You're making conclusions based on surface level information and assumptions that may not be accurate. 

As far as more articles, if you want a lit review I don't mind, but it will take longer than the last 10 minutes of my break to do it.

If someone has no anti-bodies, either because their vaxx is out of date or their body isn't able to produce antibodies, then they would be able to get jabbed for a booster. 

This would be stupid because antibodies don't stick around forever. If someone had COVID a year ago they won't have antibodies now unless they have a recent or current infection. If someone has antibodies it could mean they recently got vaccinated or they have a current infection. If they have a current infection and have antibodies, they could still be vaxxed or unvaxxed. I don't see how the presence of antibodies is useful for triage purposes.

&gt; Furthermore, ER isn't the issue here it's the surgeries and treatments that are falling behind.

Eventually I called my sister and her boyfriend came and picked me up and took me to the hospital.

And yet, ventilators are a key area of medical shortage right now. 

80% of covid patients who go on a ventilator don't recover. So the ventilator may postpone their death for a little while, but it usually doesn't save them. 

And the chance of being successfully weaned off the vent goes down the longer you're on the vent. After two weeks, only a young, healthy person has any real chance of transitioning to breathing on their own. 

Taking care of somebody on a ventilator requires a LOT of staff resources. We need those ICU nurses and respiratory therapists to help people who have more than a 20% chance of survival. 

Hell, even supplies like oxygen and the drugs needed for vent patients are in short supply in hard-hit states.

So yes, Covid triage should absolutely include taking people off vents.

&gt;According to the book - written by journalist Joe Miller in collaboration with BioNTech‚Äôs founders Dr Ugur Sahin and Dr √ñzlem T√ºrec - lobbyists branded Pfizer ‚Äúthe epitome of cold capitalism‚Äù and claimed: ‚ÄúIf we give one euro to CureVac, or Sanofi, or a European company, it is one euro for Europe. If we give it to BioNTech, 50 cents will always end up in the US.‚Äù

&gt;It is not known what impact the lobbying effort had. However, the European Union only ordered doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine last November once efficacy data for the jab had been published - nearly five months after the UK and US.

&gt;Brussels is instead said to have favoured vaccines developed by French company Sanofi and German business CureVac. Both are yet to come to market.

&gt;BioNTech bosses claimed that there was a lack of support from the EU when they were developing the jab, saying the business felt ‚Äúon our own‚Äù according to the book, The Vaccine.

What is interesting is that the CDC tracker seems to be overly conservative and uses a buffer on the average number of deaths for the previous five years.  

I just went back and redid my calculations because my code didn't account for 2021 and I'm seeing 923,000 excess deaths above the average for The last 5 years when calculated at the state level and then summed. I had noticed that some states actually had, during certain periods of time, dropped below average deaths and that a number of the calculations were taking that in and it was decreasing the national total. I opted for zeroing out deaths below average since I don't think covid itself pulled anyone out of the grave.

[],,momo-official,,,[],,,,text,t2_3r85nmc,False,False,[],"Sure. Prefacing with IANAD (I'm getting a PhD, not an MD), so please take this with a grain of salt.

Vaccination is a numbers game. Essentially, we want as few homes (bodies) for the virus as possible. The fact that we have only four major variants is a testament to how slowly coronaviruses evolve, since mutating meaningfully (and generating a beneficial mutation on top of that) is rare. However, since we've given this virus trillions on trillions of chances to reproduce by living in our (unvaccinated) bodies until now, we've given it trillions on trillions of chances for it to mutate and mutate in a way that's beneficial. The vaccine severely limits those chances. The more people vaccinated, the less chances we'll get another big variant that fucks us up as bad as Delta.

So with that in mind, the U.S. walked back boosters for all but the immunocompromised for now because we don't have enough bodies vaccinated yet worldwide. AFAIK boosters are just a third shot of the regular vaccine. If other countries are short on vaccines, it's way more important that we get them set up and protected before we think about boosting our existing protection. All of us &gt;50% immune does way more to weaken this virus than half of us &gt;90% immune and half unprotected.

It may also be soothing to know that whether or not vaccine efficacy wanes is still being studied and really depends on what angle you look at it from. Case numbers among the vaccinated in the U.S. may be rising because we're just now opening concerts, schools, etc., so we're back to being packed in with each other-- but there isn't a corresponding bump in hospitalizations or deaths among the vaccinated in the U.S. If you measured efficacy based on who's testing positive, then yes, it can appear as though we need boosters ASAP. But efficacy in terms of hospitalizations and deaths is still really good and means we can safely focus on getting everyone else vaccinated first.

Once we all have at least some degree of protection, then it's a good time to administer boosters. Hope this helps!

The province will review the vaccination rate and the risk of coronavirus infection in different areas before allowing activities to resume in low-risk areas (green zones).  
  
According to the plan, from September 20 the province will resume essential services in low-risk areas where no COVID-19 community cases have been found for at least 14 days.  
  
To date, 75 of 170 communes in ƒê·ªìng Nai are recognised as COVID-safe zones. The areas are mostly located in T√¢n Ph√∫, ƒê·ªãnh Qu√°n, Xu√¢n L·ªôc, Th·ªëng Nh·∫•t and C·∫©m M·ªπ Districts and Long Th√†nh Town.  
  
Non-essential services in green zones might be allowed to reopen if their employees have had at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose in the last 14 days and strictly follow safety protocols.  
  
Food and drink businesses will only serve takeaway. Sellers and buyers must keep their distance and wear a face mask.  
  
Fully vaccinated people and those who have recovered from COVID in the last 180 days in green zones could join essential activities.  
  
Residents who are fully vaccinated or COVID-19 patients who have recovered over the past six months in green zones would be allowed to go out for essential reasons from 6 am to 6 pm.  
  
In addition, construction work in green zones, agriculture, transportation and goods transport activities can resume under certain requirements after September 20.  
  
Sports and cultural events and services will remain suspended until further notice, according to the plan.  
  
In red, orange and yellow zones, social distancing measures will remain in place until further notice.  
  
ƒê·ªìng Nai Province has reported 35,901 cases, with 15,000 patients having fully recovered and 320 deaths, according to its anti-virus steering committee.  
  
The province is speeding up vaccinations to achieve 100 per cent first-dose coverage for 2.2 million people aged over 18 by September 20. The province has inoculated with at least one dose over 1.6 million people, meeting around 73 per cent of the target. ‚Äî VNS",,,,1631717894,,{},hcygyq8,True,t3_pors0u,False,True,t3_pors0u,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pors0u/vietnam_ƒë·ªìng_nai_to_reopen_essential_services_in/hcygyq8/,1631824440.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

Secretary of the HCM City Party Committee Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn N√™n said a pilot ""new normal‚Äù scheme for HCM City after September 15 will first operate in the two districts.  
  
At an online meeting of the city Party Committee last Monday, N√™n agreed with the HCM City‚Äôs Steering Committee of Epidemic Prevention and Control that District 7 and C·ªß Chi District have basically controlled the COVID-19 epidemic and chose the two districts to pilot a new scheme of operation for HCM City after September 15.   
  
The outlying district of C·ªß Chi has recorded over 6,000 cases of COVID-19, most of which have recovered. Very few cases have become severe.   
  
Chairman of the district People‚Äôs Committee Ph·∫°m Th·ªã Thanh Hi·ªÅn said that C·ªß Chi had stayed alert and developed a response strategy to minimise the number of deaths when the fourth wave broke out in June.  
  
Separation of positive COVID-19 cases has been C·ªß Chi District‚Äôs priority. While many were encouraged to visit the nearest medical facilities for an examination,  some cases isolating at home have been closely monitored with support from doctors and volunteers.  
  
C·ªß Chi stressed the importance of ‚Äúremote interception‚Äù in reducing morbidity and morality rates among infected cases.   
  
About 10 mobile medical teams were formed in many wards to take care of COVID-19 patients and people with other conditions isolating at home.  
  
Isolation zones have operated as nursing areas, creating comfortable conditions for patients during treatment.  
  
Dr Tr∆∞∆°ng T·∫•n H√πng from the C·ªß Chi District Medical Centre said that a relaxed and optimistic mindset is beneficial to patients' recovery.   
  
Isolation areas in C·ªß Chi District initially received and classified infected patients based on their level of illness and transferred them to upper-level hospitals offering COVID-19 treatment.  
  
However, due to overloading at upper-level hospitals, the area has been converted to a district hospital with COVID-19 treatment for patients with mild to no symptoms.  
  
Doctors there have quickly mobilised necessary equipment, drugs, first aid kits, oxygen tanks and operators to provide timely emergency care to seriously ill patients.  
  
Hi·ªÅn added that many volunteers were joining hands to help the medical force.  
  
‚ÄúMany teachers cooked lemongrass juice for infected cases on a daily basis, while young and healthy asymptomatic patients helped monitor elderly patients‚Äô health staying in the same room in an effort to reduce the workload for doctors and nurses,‚Äù Hi·ªÅn said.  
  
Efforts to invest in low-level care kept the rate of seriously ill patients in C·ªß Chi at 3.5 per cent, about 114 cases of the more than 3,200 cases in concentrated isolation zones in HCM City. More than 10 people have died.  
  
Deputy Health Minister Nguy·ªÖn Tr∆∞·ªùng S∆°n praised C·ªß Chi District‚Äôs efforts to maintain its green zone status and ensure quality of life for infected cases.   
  
Similarly, District 7 has taken the initiative to take care of infected patients from the beginning, helping to limit the morality rate.  
  
Previously, the district recorded 10 to 12 deaths per day. However, the number of deaths had fallen to one or two as of late August, while the average number of deaths per day in HCM City was more than 260.  
  
The chairman of District 7 People‚Äôs Committee, Ho√†ng Minh Tu·∫•n Anh, said in early May when the city required each district to have about 200 treatment beds, District 7 had prepared 33 facilities with about 3,400 beds capable of separating infected cases from the community. At the same time, a specialised hospital with COVID-19 treatment, consisting of 600 treatment beds and 150 emergency beds, was built as well.  
  
By the beginning of August, when the number of infected cases in HCM City had exceeded 100,000 and hospitals were overloaded with patients, District 7 pioneered the operation of a community health system in 10 wards to promptly support new cases in isolation areas.   
  
Each ward has a team of 10 to 15 medical staff and volunteers, two hotlines, ambulances, medical equipment, wheelchairs and stretchers to help locals in small alleys.   
  
They have been able to take care of over 2,500 patients and 1,800 patients with suspected illness at home.  
  
District 7 has also established 34 mobile medical stations with 83 doctors, 272 volunteers and medical staffs to provide treatment and primary care for common diseases. Since August 20, about 2,500 cases have been assisted and 86 locals have been transferred to designated hospitals.  
  
Dr Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Thu Nga, deputy director of District 7 Hospital, said that medical teams were trying to keep in touch with patients at home, which has helped reduce the number of severe cases, and thus the mortality rate.  
  
Patients with moderate to severe symptoms are being treated at the 3,000-bed Hospital 16, the Intensive Care Centre (ICU) at B·∫°ch Mai Hospital with 500 beds, District 7 Hospital and some private hospitals.  
  
When the number of critically ill patients increased in the early days of August, the Intensive Care Centre, which just went into operation, has solved the overloading problem.   
  
About 70 per cent of patients from lower levels transferred to this hospital required mechanical ventilation. Support in terms of manpower and machinery from ICU has helped more than 200 patients recover.  
  
In order to share the burden with the city, a hospital offering COVID-19 treatment in District 7 has installed a 32-tonne oxygen tank to provide healthcare for hundreds of patients, instead of having to change hundreds of bottles of oxygen every day.  
  
Since April 27, HCM City has recorded more than 265,000 COVID-19 cases. ‚Äî- VNS",,,,1631717799,,{},hcygqll,True,t3_porqvz,False,False,t3_porqvz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/porqvz/vietnam_hcm_citys_c·ªß_chi_district_district_7_find/hcygqll/,1631824315.0,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;However, medical experts who have been keeping track of COVID-19 vaccines and their effectiveness, say there are very few situations and conditions which would force a patient to put off getting vaccinated.

&gt;Dr. David Dowdy, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told ABC News that the large and growing data on the three coronavirus vaccines shows there are no immediate health issues or side effects for most people with pre-existing medical conditions.

&gt;""Other than age, there are no major exemptions that cover large groups of people,"" he told ABC News.

&gt;The current guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the two-dose mRNA vaccines and the one dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine are safe for almost all patients.

&gt;The only major contraindication to the vaccines listed by the CDC is a severe allergic reaction to the first dose. In those cases, the person is advised to consult a physician and hold off on their second dose, according to Dowdy.

&gt;""We're not talking about some people who had pain at the site of injection or a rash, we're talking about anaphylactic shock,"" he said.

&gt;Dowdy said the data so far shows this severe allergy is rare, and less than one in 1 million people experience it.

&gt;Dr. Jeff Linder, the chief of general internal medicine and geriatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, told ABC News that research so far shows that those who have a severe allergic reaction are likely triggered by polyethylene glycol (PEG), a component in the vaccines.

&gt;""An allergy to that is pretty rare,"" he told ABC News. ""It would have to be documented, as a moderate or severe allergy, before I would consider giving a medical exemption.""

&gt;Overall, the COVID-19 vaccines are safe for people with ""moderate to severe immune compromise,"" underlying conditions, pregnant women, women trying to get pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, according to the CDC.

&gt;Linder said these populations are most vulnerable to severe illness and death from the coronavirus and it is important that they get their shot.

&gt;""Anyone who says, 'I have a medical condition,' that is more of a reason to get vaccinated,"" he said.

&gt;The CDC has some extra precautions in place for people with certain medical conditions. For example, people with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), are advised to get an mRNA vaccine if they are within 90 days of illness, the CDC said. Women over 50 are also warned about a potential risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) if they chose the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, according to the CDC.

&gt;The agency currently advises holding off on immediately getting the vaccine under two circumstances.

&gt;If a person is currently diagnosed with COVID-19 or under quarantine for a suspected case, they are advised from getting their shots until the quarantine period is over, according to the agency's guidelines. If a patient is receiving monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma for COVID-19 treatment, they are advised to hold off on their vaccine appointment for 90 days, the CDC said.

&gt;Dowdy said neither scenario should stop someone from getting any of the vaccines once they're eligible.

&gt;""People ask, 'If I've gotten COVID in the past can I get the vaccine?' The answer is yes, getting the vaccine adds additional protection,"" he said.

&gt;Dr. Jay Bhatt, an internal medicine physician, an instructor at the University of Illinois School of Public Health and an ABC News contributor, added that special care should be taken for patients who are awaiting an organ transplant, recently received an organ transplant or are receiving metastatic cancer treatment. Those patients should talk with their physicians and set up a timetable for the earliest and safest time to get their shots.

&gt;""It's less about not being vaccinated, it's more about when they want to do it,"" he said. ""If they're in the midst of treatment‚Ä¶you want to make sure they're situated appropriately.""

&gt;Researchers say it's highly unlikely that that list of medical exemptions will change in the near future. Over 178 million Americans over 12 have been fully vaccinated since December and there have been no reports so far of any adverse effects to patients who have medical conditions, according to Linder.

&gt;""The idea that we're missing something that's even rare or severe seems very unlikely to me,"" he said.

&gt;Linder recommended that anyone who is still hesitant about getting the vaccine over a medical issue should consult their doctor and review the data that has overwhelmingly shown the vaccines are safe.

&gt;""The risk for COVID is still high,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, we know the COVID vaccines are highly effective at preventing hospitalization and death.""

One is that natural infections are less controlled since they are not a manmade vaccine, so the antibody response would be more likely to vary between individuals. This is especially true for future strains, as the vaccines are specifically designed to target the spike whereas a natural infection is not. Generally that concern is about people who only have natural immunity though, vaccine + natural is definitely a more complicated question.

Testing on kids isn't considered unethical in this type of situation.  It's not like there isn't lots of prior testing in other ages of kids, adults, etc. over time prior to the testing on these ages to happen.  There shouldn't be *huge* concerns with this testing when taken into the context of everything that happened before.

Also, it does function on parental consent.  Parents have to sign their kids up for clinical trials so it's not really random kids being tested on.

So yes I agree that the CDC data is straightforward, and my misunderstanding of your posts is my fault, but your response to the AAP data, attempts to cast it as bogus compared to the CDC data, etc., rather than identifying and providing the simple explanation that I identified above, exacerbated the confusion. 

By the way, if you seriously are just trying to help, if you post that CDC data again I would encourage you to specifically point out that it‚Äôs percentage of hospitalizations as compared to the entire population of Children in the US, and also to post the AAP data that shows the percentage of child infections that result in hospitalization.

Yes but assuming we DID triage based on antibodies, rather than vaxx status, then we'd be able to set aside 20 beds remain for other ER patients.

That is because antibodies to the spike protein can block attachment of virus to cell receptors. Antibodies to other viral proteins certainly arise during infection (that is why we test for anti-N antibodies to confirm infection) but these antibodies do not block infection. Hence the focus on spike in many vaccines. What happens in the germinal centers of lymphoid organs is 'affinity maturation' - the antibody coding genes are mutated and various versions of the antibodies are produced. These are 'tested' in the lymph node to see which bind more tightly to the antigen. At the same time antibodies may be made that can bind spike variants that are not even present. This process takes many months. The short time frame of the vaccines (done for emergency reasons) precluded the initial production of such good antibodies. We see them in people who have recovered from infection and receive one dose of vaccine - the antibodies in these people can neutralize all CoV tested and likely any variant to emerge.,,,,1631722061,,{},hcyr084,True,t3_poobgc,False,False,t1_hcxzygv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/poobgc/im_dr_vincent_racaniello_a_virology_professor_at/hcyr084/,1631829992.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

Thought experiment on flipping the scenario:

Let's pretend one year from now that a new strain comes about that hits the vaccinated on par with Delta tearing up the unvaccinated. Perhaps the vaccination results in cytokine storms that require the same level of hospitalization. The unvaccinated can't get beds and face the same issues they're currently creating.

How would they respond and approach the problem? Would we see the same level of cautioned debate on the morality of allowing the vaccinated to take up hospital beds when they wilfully chose vaccination?

Or... would we see shootings, lynch mobs, and attacks on hospitals overwhelmed with vaccinated patients. 

My guess is the most rabid of antivaxxers wouldn't extend the courtesy of a moral debate - nor feel that the vaccinated are deserving of the level of care currently given to the unvaccinated.",,,,1631739339,,{},hczxn6z,False,t3_poqczw,False,True,t3_poqczw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/poqczw/a_boy_went_to_a_covidswamped_er_he_waited_for/hczxn6z/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,23e3304e5ef68282400745a61df4734cd3e88218,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1631739352.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

What is driving that desire, and if you remove the last 18 months of trauma and fear from the  equation, does avoiding infection entirely still feel important?

What are the real risks of getting infected if we're statistically unlikely to end up in the hospital due to infection and even less likely to die? Yeah, it does suck getting sick, no one loves that, but is it necessary to keep chasing a risk-free lifestyle in order for normal life to resume? We're still not even 100% sure the vaccinated are spreading this effectively, and long COVID remains poorly defined in the both unvaccinated and the vaccinated. 

Beyond all that, how long does this effect from a third dose even last? Would immunity from a mild infection post-vaccination last longer? We honestly have no idea about any of this and it's hard to blame the experts from feeling torn about when we have zero answers and a sizable portion of the world (and the country!) still remains immunologically naive. If we say that yes, protecting everyone from infection is a good idea right now, what do we say in six months if that infection wanes again? A fourth dose? A fifth? Doses every 4-6 months? Do we need to continue to manufacture doses for Americans on a massive scale who might not actually need it for any statistical benefit beyond avoiding a cold?

However, since you base your argument on the cohesiveness of water molecules, here is mine.   
I am no expert in chemistry, but cohesiveness refers to the attraction between molecules of the same kind.  
Adhesiveness is when two or dissimilar molecules bond or stick together.    
Wetness is defined as the ability of a liquid to adhere to the surface of a solid. Or at least that's what most of us have learnt. Again, we are pedants, aren't we? 

So yes, water molecules are attracted to each other. They are cohesive (the result of hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals forces). Adhesion is the result of electrostatic forces between two substances. 

So based on your argument, does it mean that cohesive forces between water molecules is synonymous with its adhesive forces? Because adhesive forces are not the same as cohesive forces. For water's adhesive forces to act and for it to 'wet', it needs a solid. So you tell me. Can water wet itself?

Umm because resources are inflexible. If you have 100 ICU beds and need to reserve 20 for surgeries just in case something goes wrong, that means you can only take care of 80 ICU patients. If you stop elective surgeries then you can take care of 100 ICU patients.

&gt; If we allocate a capped portion of ICU beds to covid then we can allow for the heart attack/ladder folk to receive care.

First, not everyone gets COVID because they're being careless, so it wouldn't be fair to deny them care. People have to go to work, kids have to go to school, etc. Second, it's hard to justify leaving a perfectly good ICU bed empty just in case someone falls off a ladder while a COVID patient is gasping for breath in the ER. Some hospitals have considered triaging based on vaccine status but that's not a terribly popular idea either.

&gt; If they go out, you can consider rationalising enforcement measures such as tickets for public endangerment or breaching a public health order. 

I'm all for this but half the states in the country won't even mandate masks, let alone allow ticketing for breaking COVID curfew.

&gt; Using rapid testing, rather than passports, at certain indoor establishments, we'd know who has what antibodies, and we can allow for contact tracing.

Rapid tests aren't that rapid (15-45 min) and aren't 100% accurate. There is also a significant % of people who don't make antibodies for COVID at all, so rapid tests wouldn't work for them.

Until recently, the US has only really done surgical masks for health reasons, and N95 for construction.

If you meant from the broader set of mask options:

**Cloth:** continues to be shown to have a very modest impact, like 10-20% effective

**Surgical:** More effective compared to cloth than I expected, iirc something like 40-50%

**KN95/N95:** I haven't seen numbers, but my expectation is that they are near 100% effective if used consistently.

Even the 10-20/40-50% rates for cloth and surgical masks are likely to be based on outcomes, ie: assuming imperfect use.
