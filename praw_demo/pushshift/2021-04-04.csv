Yes, these are more on the short term side, specifically the allergic reaction. We don't know the long term effects, because the vaccine has only been studied for less than a year. 

Again, my concern is the long term effects. Idk, what it could be, which is why we need long term studies on vaccines/medicines. What's the likelihood chance of being bad? I agree with you, very very very low, since the thing just lets you produce covid-like proteins so the body can identify it easier (i.e. doesn't fuck with your DNA as some conspiracy theorist spout). It's all risk/benefit. For instance, if I was to go visit my grandparent in a month, I would certainly take it to keep them safe, (benefits outweigh the risk). For now though, I don't need it.

Your point of nearly 2000 dead in the 18-29 yo age group is a very fair point. It is likely that those people were at high risk and/or had comorbidities. IMO, if the vaccine was available, their doctor would recommend it to them. For the majority of the population, it'll be fine (but people should talk to their doctor to make sure). 

Listen, I'm not against taking the vaccine. I'm against making it mandatory to take the vaccine. People should be able to make their own fully informed choice with the help of their doctor. For me, I'm in no rush and would rather wait a bit in case they find something wrong with it (which again, very very low chance).

What isn't clear in reporting is how many cases are occurring in general but you would expect those investigating do know. It certainly doesn't make it clear from the outside if things are worse than has ever been seen before.

For women of child baring age it is reported that they have much higher incidences of cvst likely due to the contraceptive pill. So reports of women being more prone correlate as expected but again no clear reporting going on with the people who have been affected.

People also are behaving differently, it is quite possible people died because they left it too late to seek treatment than they would otherwise in 'normal' times.

2. You are being disingenuous when you make these assertions. 

Specifically, you are claiming causality when your sources themselves do not dare claim the association. You specifically went to the Nature article, went to the ""Safety"" section, and converted it all into bullet points. But you left out a lot of the wording of that section - wording that very well is important.

[Table from article showing all vaccines under development at time of publication.

&gt;  Local and systemic inflammation

&gt; The biodistribution and persistence of expressed immunogen.

&gt; Stimulation of auto-reactive antibodies.

&gt; Potential toxic effects of any non-native nucleotides and delivery system components (particularly those that have not been disclosed by manufacturers).

 However, recent [note: 2018 or prior] human trials have demonstrated moderate and in rare cases severe injection site or systemic reactions for different mRNA platforms22,91. **Potential** safety concerns that are **likely to be evaluated in future preclinical and clinical studies** include local and systemic inflammation, the biodistribution and persistence of expressed immunogen, stimulation of auto-reactive antibodies and potential toxic effects of any non-native nucleotides and delivery system components. 

On your last point, here's [Moderna's](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/moderna.html) ingredients. And here's [Pfizer's](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/pfizer-biontech.html).

&gt; Induction of a potent type 1 interferon response, which has been associated with inflammation and potential autoimmunity. Thus, identification of individuals at an increased risk of autoimmune reactions before mRNA vaccination should be undertaken.

A **possible** concern could be that some mRNA-based vaccine platforms54,166 induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation but also **potentially** with autoimmunity

Thus, identification of individuals at an increased risk of autoimmune reactions before mRNA vaccination may allow reasonable precautions to be taken.  --LIKE WE DO NOW???

&gt; Presence of extracellular RNA, which may contribute to edema and pathogenic thrombus formation (blood clots). Extracellular naked RNA has been shown to increase the permeability of tightly packed endothelial cells and may thus contribute to edema. Another study showed that extracellular RNA promoted blood coagulation and pathological thrombus formation.

first, 2007 studies as the 'newest' info on this topic. LOL

Another **potential** safety issue **could derive** from the presence of extracellular RNA during mRNA vaccination. Extracellular naked RNA has been shown to increase the permeability of tightly packed endothelial cells and **may** thus contribute to oedema

However, I could never have a real discussion with the lockdown skeptics because their arguments were so, so bad. You have a wealth of real, widespread societal issues that should be considered when creating COVID restrictions. They chose to latch on to suicides, missed cancer screenings, drug overdoses, and nonsensical puritanical arguments about the sanctity of freedom. It was unbearable.

We definitely fucked up this response. We definitely should have moved mountains for COVID. We definitely didn't overreact. We just reacted horribly, and we didn't consider the real negative effects of lockdowns. Then, we didn't even lockdown correctly at all, so we wound up with almost the worst of both worlds.

We forced everyone to adopt a sedentary lifestyle without putting anything in place to prevent weight gain. This will cause a massive number of early cardiac deaths by exacerbating our obesity epidemic.

We took kids out of school for a year and basically let poor kids with bad internet connections or no support at home fall a year behind their peers. This will exacerbate problems with intergenerational success and socioeconomic mobility.

We crushed the mental health of pretty much anyone under 30, not married, and not a massive introvert. This was probably worth it, tbh, and I say that as someone who lived with crippling depression all year.

We widened the wealth gap to an incredible extent and probably won't fully recover from this for generations.

There are so many good arguments out there about the things we should have considered more carefully when choosing how and when to lockdown.

[],,Viewfromthe31stfloor,,,,,,[],"&gt;The number of American adults reporting recent bouts of anxiety or depression rose significantly between August and February, increasing to more than two in five adults in late January, federal health researchers said on Friday.

&gt;The largest increases were among young adults and those who never finished high school, but every demographic group — including all racial and ethnic groups, genders and ages — experienced some increase in symptoms, said Anjel Vahratian, an associate director at the National Center for Health Statistics and the report’s lead author.

&gt;Among adults aged 18 to 29, the percentage who reported having anxiety or depressive symptoms in the previous week increased to 57 percent in late January, up from 49 percent in August 2020. About half of respondents without a high school diploma reported symptoms recently, up from 41.8 percent in August. Overall, 41.4 percent of all adults reported symptoms in late January and early February, up from 36.4 percent in August.

&gt;Men and women reported more symptoms, as did adults in their 30s and adults in their 60s, who saw statistically significant increases.

&gt;Dr. Vahratian said she was surprised by the magnitude of the increases. Though the study does not prove the problems were caused by the pandemic, previous studies have shown a link between large disease outbreaks and mental health, she noted.

&gt;”You have extended social restrictions, limits on businesses, isolation and issues with employment — these have all been associated with increases in mental health problems,” Dr. Vahratian said. “We can’t speak to the direct causes because the survey didn’t ask about the cause of the symptoms. But it suggests that a variety of things going on during the pandemic are involved.”

&gt;The data, reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are based on an ongoing survey called the Household Pulse Survey, which polls tens of thousands of Americans. The sample is nationally representative, but the researchers noted that people without internet access could not participate in the online format.

&gt;The number of Americans seeking mental health treatment increased during the pandemic, with 24.8 percent of adults saying they were receiving treatment in February, up from 22.4 percent in August. But the number of respondents who said they needed counseling and did not receive it also increased, to 11.7 percent from 9.2 percent.

&gt;The latest data, however, may suggest that Americans are feeling a bit better, Dr. Vahratian said. New numbers from the survey, which is ongoing, point to a slight decrease in symptoms of anxiety and depression in March, she added.",,,1617615465,{},gtfqboz,True,t3_mkgs02,False,True,t3_mkgs02,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mkgs02/more_than_two_in_five_american_adults_reported/gtfqboz/,1617615475,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_3nelaphm,False,True,,

Good point. I was guilty of looking at the total number of vaccinations. That's a pretty stupid error.

But having crunched the numbers, I don't think it actually changes the conclusion, does it? 

In the UK we have vaccinated about 6.5 million people who are under 50; they would be clinically vulnerable individuals and health care workers who were prioritised amongst the early vaccine cohorts. I can't find a breakdown of these between Pfizer and AZ; overall I about 60% of our vaccinations have been AZ, but the early cohorts would have been predominantly Pfizer because that came on steam faster. It probably wouldn't be unreasonable to guesstimate at 2:1 Pfizer:AZ for this cohort, so we probably have around 2 million under-50s having had AZ vaccines in the UK. But let's be ultra conservative and say its only 1 million. And 7 fatal thromboembolic events, so that's ~ 1 per 140k.

But half the vaccinations have been in men, whereas the thromboembolic events seem to occur almost exclusively in women. So that's ~ 1 per 70k women. The data from Norway suggest 1 per 35k women, which is twice as high but I guess you can get variations like this when dealing with such small numbers.

But even so, 1 per 35k is 0.003%, which is still a fair bit higher than the Covid IFR for young adults. Admittedly it's not an order of magnitude higher,  but I think this helps to show why the regulators are still saying that the benefits of the vaccine out weight the risks.

(Having said that, they absolutely do need to be investigating whether there are subgroups of the population for whom the risk is higher.)",,,1617613906,{},gtfoqk0,False,t3_mk8wjh,False,True,t1_gtfmtko,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mk8wjh/7_uk_astrazeneca_recipients_die_of_clots/gtfoqk0/,1617613916,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_3k581krx,False,False,,

It's well know the Astrazeneca vaccine is being used for the majority of the population because it's cheaper. Such as a price list here:

CureVac: €10.
Moderna: $18.""

Also, on any given year I push academic writing. My ELA counterparts are busy teaching to those tests where I have the luxury of doing whatever the fuck I want. Last year at this time we'd written probably 6-8 essays. Varying in length and increasing in scope as the year progresses. Only my advanced classes have touched essay writing at all. I'm no where near the skills set I was at this time last year. I've done maybe 3. I've completely abandoned it as there's no way to spend the time on it and my curriculum at this point. 

My low and EC kids also usually write. I'm lucky if they can do even simple things at this point. Most completely disengage when remote. Others have parents that complete ALL their assignments when not at school. And after over a year of that, they've fallen. Hard. 

So even with cutting my curriculum and the shit I privilege the most, my kids simple can't keep up. Assignments that would take a class 25 minutes last year can easily run 50+ this year. They simply work slower from the lack of rigor. In August I planned on keeping my pacing. But advanced kids floundered at home unable to handle time management and their perfectionist nature, average kids just did nothing, and EC clustered kids either did nothing or parents flipped out at doing all their kids work for them. 

We've not tested this year. Obviously. And I'm not a tested subject anyway. But my kids cannot perform at the same level they could at this point last year.

Almost nobody at all will be dying from this in 50 years, and that would be true even if we did not vaccinate at all.

I was referring to mRNA vaccines, but the other vaccines under EUA are not using the SARS-CoV-2 vrus.

The mRNA is gone from you in a few days. The spike proteins made by your cells is gone in a few weeks. There's nothing left to have an effect after a few weeks, so we know all the side effects of these vaccines already. They are remarkably safe and effective.

for example:

&gt;Hoehner conducted a study of 4,297 Texas workers and found that those with long commutes (greater than 20 miles) had greater rates of high blood pressure and high blood sugar than those with short commutes (0 to 5 miles).

\- [Long commutes make you fat, tired, and miserable](https://www.vox.com/2015/5/20/8629881/commuting-health-happiness), vox.com

&gt;Driving more than 10 miles each way, to and from work, is associated with higher blood sugar, according to a report written by researchers from the University School of Medicine in Saint Louis and the Cooper Institute in Dallas and published in The American Journal of Preventive Medicine. High blood glucose levels can lead to pre-diabetes and diabetes.

&gt;The same report in The American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that the 10-mile one-way drives were also associated with higher cholesterol levels among commuters. Scary stuff since cholesterol is a warning sign for heart disease.

&gt;The researchers from the University School of Medicine in Saint Louis and the Cooper Institute in Dallas also noted in their report that people with commutes of at least 10 miles each way have a higher tendency toward depression, anxiety, and social isolation.

&gt;A new report from the U.K.’s Office of National Statistics finds that people who commute more than half an hour to work each way report higher levels of stress and anxiety than people with shorter commutes or no commutes at all.

&gt;The same report from the U.K. found that people with commutes of any length experience lower life satisfaction and happiness than people with no commutes at all. Riding a bus for 30 minutes or longer was associated with the lowest levels of life satisfaction and happiness, but even if you’re lucky enough to bike to work and enjoy the beautiful outdoors, your satisfaction takes a nosedive commensurate to how long you spend doing it.

(i think we can all agree long distances on non-commuter busses are most stressful after cars, heh)

A new vaccine for Covid-19 that is entering clinical trials in Brazil, Mexico, Thailand and Vietnam could change how the world fights the pandemic. The vaccine, called NVD-HXP-S, is the first in clinical trials to use a new molecular design that is widely expected to create more potent antibodies than the current generation of vaccines. And the new vaccine could be far easier to make.

Existing vaccines from companies like Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson must be produced in specialized factories using hard-to-acquire ingredients. In contrast, the new vaccine can be mass-produced in chicken eggs — the same eggs that produce billions of influenza vaccines every year in factories around the world.

If NVD-HXP-S proves safe and effective, flu vaccine manufacturers could potentially produce well over a billion doses of it a year. Low- and middle-income countries currently struggling to obtain vaccines from wealthier countries may be able to make NVD-HXP-S for themselves or acquire it at low cost from neighbors.

“That’s staggering — it would be a game-changer,” said Andrea Taylor, assistant director of the Duke Global Health Innovation Center.

First, however, clinical trials must establish that NVD-HXP-S actually works in people. The first phase of clinical trials will conclude in July, and the final phase will take several months more. But experiments with vaccinated animals have raised hopes for the vaccine’s prospects.

“It’s a home run for protection,” said Dr. Bruce Innis of the PATH Center for Vaccine Innovation and Access, which has coordinated the development of NVD-HXP-S. “I think it’s a world-class vaccine.”",,,1617658766,{},gti0tn2,True,t3_mkvm2w,False,True,t3_mkvm2w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mkvm2w/researchers_are_hatching_a_lowcost_covid19_vaccine/gti0tn2/,1617661386,1,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_m76zflk,False,True,,

Also some cool data that’s supposed to come out (pre print now) is that the vaccines seem to have a strong T cell (like, CD8+ in particular IIRC)  response. So for people that might have suppressed antibody responses (read: B cell) and HIV etc, there might still be some protection. I think the combination of vaccine and monoclonal cocktails will be interesting, but I worry for this population a lot.

I countered by saying, no, New York City had mass scale surveillance testing in schools. You argued they weren’t in school when they were. You argued they didn’t do testing. All of which was wrong. Now you’re saying it doesn’t count because middle and high schoolers weren’t in it and some kids were virtual? GTFOH with the goal post moving. You were wrong.

And I’m not missing the point. I said this exact point in one of my comments before you said it. 

&gt; Granted, part of the reason NYC was successful was because they had strict protocols. Surveillance testing, mask mandates, automatic school shutdowns for 10 days if they have 2 or more untraceable cases, travel restrictions for teachers and staff. I doubt most schools will do this and probably have more spread as a result.


Also, this has zero relevance:

&gt; 2. November surge in NYC did happen until post Thanksgiving. Testing from Nov 1-18 is worthless, surge hadn't happened yet.

- the conditions needed to cause a Covid spike and the conditions needed to cause a TB spike are the same. 
- Even in the best of times, only 77% of TB cases in SA are successfully treated. 
- The number is even worse for Multi drug resistant TB. 

Are the spike likely caused by Covid? Yes. However, if you have a pandemic (TB) and you allocate half your resources to that pandemic to stop another global health crisis, you are going to have excess deaths either way. That's not diminishing or minimizing the impact of Covid, its saying that excess deaths in South Africa, which has an existing respiratory infection pandemic can't just be taken as ""1 extra death = 1 untracked Covid death"".

The problem is not that people disagree on the negative dffect of shutdowns on our society; the problem is that too many people have a reductive attitude when it comes to the pandemic.

The people who are arguing that the shutdowns should end because of the academic, social and emotional challenges children face are not acknowledging or pursuing any other solution or alternatives. It always comes down to ending shutdown measures and there is rarely, if ever, acknowledgment of the real danger this poses to these children, their families and their collective communities.

If we're worried about children struggling academically, then let's talk about our education system's inability to function properly in the digital age. Let's talk about the rampant digital illiteracy in children *and* adults. We're the richest country in the world at the height of modern technology, yet our schools struggle to handle online schooling. Social media is plugged into the fabric of society, yet we can't organize healthy social opportunities for our kids. On top of that, mental health has always been a low priority in our society and it's been hurting kids for generations. This pandemic is only highlighting the problems and weaknesses that were already there and will continue to be there... Unless we do something about it.

So if you really care about those problems, address them directly. Let's get loud about this stuff.

One of my children is one you'd flag. She is eleven. She has gained weight and is far less motivated than most to do anything virtual. It's like pulling teeth to get her to do anything at all and requires that I am next to her for every second of it. She has slipped to far below her peers in math and science, though at least she performs much higher than the average in english and social studies. 

I ache to get her back in a classroom.

However, I have a condition that makes it extremely risky for me to contract covid. I finally got my first vaccine a few days ago (I could have gotten it earlier, but the supply was too low in my county and they kept running out!), and although a two-day a week plan for in-person schooling starts tomorrow, I don't get my second vaccine for three weeks. 

So I have to ask myself hard questions. Yes, you would absolutely red flag her, and I think it would absolutely be better for her in general to return to school. On the other hand, her socializing skills have actually GREATLY improved, we've already modified her diet and are upping her physical activity during the day, and her and I are extremely close. This being the case, and after reading what I just read...is it worth it to risk the life of her mother instead of holding out a little longer until I'm fully vaccinated?

You claimed that I am ""so incorrect it's astounding"" and you claim to have followed the science from the start. I can only assume you are referring to my rebuttal that there is no way that we will have ""vast"" majority of the country vaccinated in ""1 or 2 months"". 

There are two main reasons you are wrong. 

First, Moderna began manufacturing their vaccine as early as July and Pfizer began manufacturing their vaccine by October. The first doses began distribution in mid December. As of today, 162 million doses have been given, 59.9 million people have been fully vaccinated, which amounts to 18.2% of the U.S. population. In order for us to reach &gt;50% we would have to vaccinate 2.8 times as many people in the next two months as we have in the last four. But you didn't say majority, you said ""vast"" majority and while that is arbitrary, let's assign it a value between 50% and 100%, let's say 75%. For 75% of the country to be vaccinated you would need to deliver four times as many vaccines in half the time. Also please don't forget, because of the three weeks between doses (except Johnson &amp; Johnson), you need to get roughly half the country their first dose in the next five weeks to make your 2 month cutoff for vaccination. 

Second, as of right now you don't even have 75% of the country that wants to take the vaccine. By some polls as few as 62% either have or are willing to take the vaccine, and that is a huge improvement over the last four months. If you add to that the number of people who might be willing, or at least indifferent, but don't have the resources, access, accessibility or just can't be bothered to actually show up and get the vaccine, your percentage drops further. Because getting the vaccine requires positive action, however slight, not getting the vaccine requires nothing. Further evidence might be the most recent election where we saw record turnout, and still only about six in ten eligible voters actually voted. 

Your second comment was simple, you just stated that once the vaccine gets FDA approval I can remember this conversation and something about sounding like a ""pathetic clown"". I get the impression you think I'm anti-vax, I'm not. I'm personally invested and very much hope the vaccine gets full approval because I'm already fully vaccinated. But I don't support making any vaccine, especially one that is the first of its kind, a mandatory requirement to participate in society for anyone until we have finished fully testing it. I know several people who are choosing to wait until the vaccine receives approval and I respect their position. And you are a close minded asshole for referring to anyone who chooses to wait as ""stupid"" and ""fools""",,,1617596112,{},gtf4gtu,False,t3_mjam0g,False,True,t1_gte2dgd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mjam0g/florida_governor_issues_order_banning_businesses/gtf4gtu/,1617596123,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_vdkcw,False,False,,

With the amount of time we spend teaching to the test, it doesn’t surprise me that when we stop doing that kids start doing poorly on tests. 

American education is notoriously a mile wide and an inch deep. Before Covid, 12th grade NAEP scores indicated that a majority of students fell in the “below expectations” category in reading and math. It’s also pretty well known that the average American reads at a 6th grade level. And this is before online learning. 

So, I take this with a grain of salt. Having mapped curriculum across 2nd-12th grade there are plenty of ways to remap the curriculum and adjust it to meet students where they’re at and then get them to AT least the 6th grade level before graduation. Honestly, most of the middle and high school curriculum is boring and results in high levels of disengagement anyways.

I've heard this line of thinking a few times during the pandemic, and I'd like to take this time to call it out for the complete nonsense it is. I'll also preemptively apologize if the forthcoming rant feels disproportionate to the intent of your comment.

My wife and I worked our way out of povery/near poverty and now both have high stress, high responsibility careers that pay very well. I promised myself many years ago that my kids would never have to listen to their parents screaming at one another over a few extra dollars on the electric bill. And they don't. I don't even know how much my fucking electric bill is. 

Nights and weekends I'm outside with them or playing video games or teaching them how to play drums or sports or whatever. But during the week we're working to make sure their college fund is growing, we can go on vacations, get them swimming lessons, send them to a killer summer camp, whatever. And it's just not possible to work full time and raise kids full time. It's not about ""not thinking we'd actually have to take care of them"", it's about leveraging the appropriate resources (i.e. schools and teachers) to take care of them because we planned with that expectation and because when it comes to the fundamentals, the school is going to do a better job than we would anyway.

Pretty sure you could not have a safer population in terms of effects. Where is this discussion of long-term damage to kids?

Nothing obvious about that in light of all the contradictory evidence.

Also, the argument for children getting vaccinated is (at least in this thread) that they aren't at risk, but that they can allow the virus to mutate, creating new variants.

That is only a risk if the current vaccines don't protect against variants, right? So you can't have both.

Plenty of real arguments out there for how lockdowns/restrictions negatively impacted society, but this one (and nearly all the ""classics"" from the anti-lockdown redditors) is a dud.

The only real arguments against restrictions were targeted arguments against some particular restriction.

Thus an event with 10 people unvaxed is roughly 4.5x more dangerous than an event with 5 people vaxed and 5 unvaxed.  

It gets really complicated with very big crowds, but imagine a packed bar with 50 people in it that are 50% vaxed vs 80% vaxed.  25\*24 vs 10\*9 is about 6.7x more risky.  Perhaps we're at 30% vaxed now, that's 2x more risky than at 50% vaxed (US at end of month?).

'Double mutant' COVID variant emerges in the U.S. Here's what that means
Variant has two notable mutations in key region
https://www.10news.com/news/coronavirus/double-mutant-covid-variant-emerges-in-the-u-s-heres-what-that-means


&gt;Scientists are investigating a coronavirus variant in India they’ve dubbed a “double mutant” whose emergence coincided with a rapid spike in cases.

snip

In this case, the phrase “double mutant” has nothing to do with the total number of mutations the variant carries. Instead, Indian health officials gave the variant this nickname because it carries two important mutations in a critical part of the virus: the part of the virus that attaches to cells, officially called the “receptor-binding domain.”

That part of the virus is also the best target for antibodies. When antibodies block the receptor-binding domain, the viral particle is incapacitated.

“Why that's concerning is that as we all get vaccinated and we start developing antibodies, perhaps these mutations make it more likely for us to get infected even after a vaccine,” Dr. Smith said. “None of that’s really borne out in real life, so to speak, but scientists are looking at it.”

These two important mutations are called L452R and E484Q. The letters and numbers are scientific shorthand to express changes in the viral code. E484Q means at the 484th position in the sequence, an E (glutamic acid) was replaced by a Q (glutamine).",,,1617602129,{},gtfcd6l,True,t3_mjq8jw,False,True,t1_gtf0od2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mjq8jw/double_mutant_covid19_variant_from_india_found_in/gtfcd6l/,1617602140,1,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_38lau,False,False,,

To add, there have been so many reinfections of people previously infected by COVID-19 that the idea of immunity, that the idea of total immunity is doubtful. 

The way I see it, the best way out of this is to enforce stricter lockdowns and shutdowns, while implementing some form of UBI and some restructuring of the economy to ensure lines of distribution aren't broken, as well as some degree of universal healthcare, as well as limits on international travel. 

And as far as mental health for students, most students are handling online classes well enough, and the ones that aren't were never in that good of mental shape to begin with.

I found this meta-analysis of age-specific infection fatality rates for Covid , published in December. 

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-020-00698-1

Meanwhile the risk of clots after taking the AZ vaccine seems to be of the order of 0.0001% to 0.001% (1 per million to 1 per 100,000).

**Study Title:** Coronavirus and Autism Behavioral Study (CABS)

**Study Description:** Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be potentially vulnerable to the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We are conducting a national study on the impact of the coronavirus on children with autism spectrum disorder and their families, with a particular interest in demographics and diversity. Broadly, we want to track the development of children with autism throughout the quarantine period of the pandemic, and learn about the emotional wellbeing and structure of the family during this time. Results from this study are hoped to help clinicians and practitioners improve treatments and services over time, supporting educational, behavioral, and social health in both children with autism and their families. Having a greater understanding of the development of children with autism following a pandemic should benefit care and enhance success in meeting the needs of these patients and their surrounding community.

**This study might be a good fit if you:**

• are over the age of 18-years-old;

• have a child with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) between the ages of 3- and 10-years-old;

• are comfortable reading and answering questions about you and your child in English, and have access to an electronic device;

• currently live in the United States.

China's censorship apparatus is the most sophisticated in the world. We can reasonably assume that they've gotten better at cracking down after the Wuhan leaks. 

I also think you shouldn't overestimate the severity of the disease, as severe as it already is. Even for all the trouble COVID has caused in the US and Europe, I only (and barely) know one person who died of COVID. Most people I know have never met someone who died of COVID. Does that mean the outbreak doesn't exist? Absolutely not. However it just goes to show that even with thousands of people dying and millions around the world, we can, fortunately, live without experiencing tragedy ourselves. 

&gt; Especially with covid being something that happens ""out in the field"" and with the press still having strong presence in major Chinese cities (honestly I haven't heard of any reporters / journalists leaving China, not over covid concerns anyway)

China expelled American journalists in March 2020. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/business/media/china-expels-american-journalists.html

You can find similar stories of other country's reporters being expelled or voluntarily leaving. 

&gt; This in addition to the Chinese people having the experience to wear masks from the SARS pendemic just a decade or so ago

Another pandemic that the Chinese government lied about and surprise-surprise, turned out to be significantly more damaging than we knew at the time and have estimated to be far more damaging than the government reported. But this time they're definitely more honest with us? Yeah right. 

&gt; Many asian countries have conspicuously lower numbers of infections and deaths. China isn't the only one. Taiwan has had like close to zero cases for the past 6 months or so for example. 

China is reporting similar numbers as Taiwan despite having significantly more people and no added protection of being an island nation. 

Adjusted for a percent of the population, China should be having thousands of cases for every case that Taiwan has. That's not happening according to the official numbers. And despite having the outbreak under control, Taiwan is still imposing strict mask and social distancing requirements. Not like that event you proudly linked in China without masks. 

&gt; I mean it will certainly be more than the 80,000 cases of reported deaths in China, but nowhere like the scale of places like Brazil or even the US if u ask me.

I could agree with that too but we just don't know. Whatever that number is, it's significantly higher than what China is reporting.

**Study Description:** The world is suffering from a pandemic called COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The different national governments have problems evaluating the reach of the epidemic, having limited resources and tests to their disposal. Hence, any means to monitor the number of persons with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 with reasonable level of accuracy is useful. The objective of this study is the collection and publication of data concerning the number of people that show symptoms compatible with COVID-19 in different countries. This data is useful to estimate the number of infected persons with the COVID-19 virus at a given point in time in these countries, and the evolution of this number over time, using techniques like the Network Scale-up Method.

**Study Title:** Understanding the Impact of COVID-19 on Sleep and Mood: Online Study

**Study Description:** While there was a necessary initial focus on physical health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is becoming increasingly clear that many have experienced significant social and mental health repercussions as well. Investigators at Boston College initiated a daily survey study in mid-March to better understand the impacts of COVID-19 and the culture of living though a pandemic. They hope to not only reveal new information about potential risk and protective factors regarding COVID-19, but also hope to better understand how many of the large-scale measures being taken will impact us as individuals and a society. **We are seeking all adults (18+) regardless of whether they have been diagnosed with COVID-19.** With over 1,900 individuals already enrolled in the study with representation from 60 different countries across 6 continents and 20 different time zones, we are re-opening enrollment for continued assessments to get as comprehensive and diverse a look as we can at the global impact of COVID19 on sleep, mental health, and well-being.

**Study Title:** Coronagenes – An international population cohort to investigate genetic susceptibility to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)

**Study Description:** Data from popular home genetic-testing kits could help scientists shed light on why some people who catch coronavirus have no symptoms while others become very ill. **Researchers are asking people from around the world who have used DNA testing services – such as Ancestry DNA, FTDNA and 23andMe – to gain ancestry or health insights to join a study that aims to identify key genes involved in the body’s response to the infection.**

Understanding the effect genes have on susceptibility to Covid-19 could aid efforts to tackle the pandemic, and help combat future disease outbreaks, researchers say. More than 30 million people worldwide have used genetic testing services. Researchers are urging them to share their DNA data to help speed up discoveries that could help fight the virus.

By providing these data, volunteers will help the team avoid the costly, time-consuming task of collecting the hundreds of thousands of DNA samples that would otherwise be needed to map the genes involved. Volunteers who have not used these services will also be able to provide the project with DNA, once current lockdown restrictions have been eased.

The team aims to identify genes that influence the risk of developing Covid-19 and those that affect disease severity, by comparing volunteers’ symptoms – or lack of them – with their DNA.

Those taking part in the University of Edinburgh study – called Coronagenes – will complete online questionnaires about their health, lifestyle and any symptoms they have experienced, such as fever or a persistent cough.

Updating the survey before, during and after an infection will help scientists detect any patterns that might indicate how the virus progresses.

Researchers also aim to analyse the long-term health consequences of infection and self-isolation.

I don't agree with this at all. 

A lot of introverts are still social people. They go on vacations, date and enter relationships, have friends, go to concerts and sporting events, etc. I considered myself introverted for a long time and while I would be happy to never commute and step foot in an office ever again, I miss hanging out with people and doing things. Even if you don't enjoy doing those things, I can't imagine why you would be unhappy seeing other people do those things. 

As someone who friends who are extremely extroverted, I promise you they don't care about what you're doing in your spare time. They just miss not being able to live the type of life they enjoy living. This idea that introverts are having a day in the sun during the pandemic doesn't add up. Reddit likes to conflate being introverted with hating people and being completely antisocial, and they're not the same thing. I'm happy you've been able to cope during the pandemic, but I don't see how the pandemic made it easier to do what you've been doing anyway. 

&gt;For introverts during the pandemic, it seemed so difficult to wrap our heads around what the heck was so difficult for extroverts. You are being asked to stay home, watch Netflix, read a book, get a hobby, etc. Things that introverts generally find pleasant were somehow tortuous for our extroverted friends.

It's not difficult at all. Extroverts enjoy doing these things too. We just don't like *only* doing these things and not being able to see friends and family. Again, you can read and watch Netflix all day during normal times just fine, don't understand why the pandemic makes it easier to do it.

This also sounds wildly similar to how people have been administering bufotene recreationally in the amazon for time immemorial, which is just to burn yourself slightly and introduce a toxin into the wound. Anyway, here's what we've known for two centuries now:

[DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) was discovered in the mid-1800’s and has two fascinating properties for any biohackers toolbox. This substance is able push other chemicals through the skin directly into the bloodstream. DMSO is also high in sulfur so it can be effective in reducing inflammation](https://blog.adafruit.com/2016/05/24/biohack-dmso-for-transdermal-substance-delivery/)


Seems that we've had ways to do transdermal delivery for drugs since the 1800s. Neat new technology, kids. Hey, you know what else is neat? Context. Whether it's through ignorance or historical revisionism, the left just confidently lies with every word. That's why they don't want you to be aware of facts and history, and while it's neat that this is all going on and shit, remember how confident people were in Theranos before it was discovered to be an absolute fraud that had never worked. A 20 person sample size for this experiment means they don't even have a statistically significant understanding of how effective their RoA might actually be or the risks involved. History paints their current stance of caring about the citizenry as unlikely at best, and them (and probably yourself, dear reader) on the wrong side of literally every social and political issue. 

Have a good one, kids, and read about Unit 731. Shit, if you've got the time,  also read up on everything our government has done to their citizenry in the name of testing or poor planning, and without consent. Read about the Gates family history of eugenics and ask why a computer guy suddenly got into the virology and vaccine game for no discernible reason a few years prior to the pandemic. Follow the path of destruction the testing of said vaccine tore through africa and india.The reason there's flouride in our drinking water in some areas has nothing to do with teeth ad everything to do with flouride being a byproduct of enriching uranium and they ""added it"" to the reservoirs in the 40s. Just saying, kids; if this sounds crazy it's becsuse you don't know history. Go read it and debunk me.

My commute in February 2020, one of NJ Transit's worst months on record, with little to no assistance or an ounce of empathy or communication with riders, averaged TWO HOURS EACH WAY. I hardly ever saw my kids if I wasn't willing to spend a fortune on Ubers and Lyfts. And I did do that at times, simply because the alternative was an hours long descent into pure madness, culminating with getting home 9pm or later, maybe eating a quick dinner, then going to bed only to wake up and fight a few more hours the next day anyway.

I literally began to hate life and was praying for something to deliver me from that daily hell where I partook in scenes like this one -

And there were some that didn't even make the news. I was on one train that got stuck between NY Penn and Secaucus... it took two and a half hours on a full train with people standing to move about a mile because it seemed like something happened with the brakes (?) (they never explained to us anything about what happened, how long it would take, or why) and so we'd lurch forward a few feet, stop... wait about five minutes... lurch forward a few feet... stop... wait five minutes. On and on and on. For hours.

Honestly, when COVID hit and I was suddenly able to work from home, every single aspect of my mental health improved and has continued to improve ever since. If I ever find myself in that situation again, my wife and I have already decided we'd continue downsizing our life while looking for work that allows work-from-home at least 3 days a week. I wouldn't mind going in 2 days a week, but to me, commuting and the mess it creates near large cities in the U.S. depended upon a lie regarding how and where work can and should be done. Bandwidth made it all possible years ago, yet we pretended it wasn't while never improving the commuting systems in some states and cities.

There is definitely nothing that makes it an advantage, that's for sure. It's just a choice and it's one that some countries make for all vaccines they're using and one I agree with. 

If JnJ's one dose was more protective that the first dose of any of the other vaccines, then it could be called an advantage, but it's not. That's why I don't like how it's deemed controversial to state the fact that JnJ offers less protection than some other vaccines. 

&gt;and I suspect it will find that it's more effective, just like every other vaccine

Actually, it's highly unlikely to increase efficacy. It has to do with vector immunity. The first dose induces an immune response against the Ad26 vector as well, so the second dose is mostly neutralized by the immune system. We see that with AstraZeneca, since it uses the same vector in both doses. We actually have a vaccine where the doses use 2 different vectors and it's Sputnik V and it really does show greater efficacy.

I think Chile’s experience shows that efficacy against milder illness can indeed matter in the time that it takes for everyone who wants to be vaccinated to get fully vaccinated which will take over a year in some countries. It’s not a casedemic situation there right now either given that the first sentence of this post’s article describes its healthcare system as “on the brink of collapse”.

Sinovac very likely doesn’t cut transmission as much as   Pfizer does which was found to prevent around 90% of all infections in a recent study.

If people cannot be motivated by care for their fellow human, maybe there's a way to motivate them using some cost. We do it with car insurance. A DUI will cost you. A driver safety course will get you a discount. We do it with life insurance. Good health gets you good rates but smoking and drug abuse will get you worse rates. I certainly didn't suggest that people lose their health insurance but why not just give them some incentive? We do it now with health improvement programs. You don't have to raise their rate, but you can certainly give them a good health discount. Perhaps a membership to a Planet Fitness or a gym of their choice. Maybe it's a free consult with a nutrition expert. Make it a choice for them to choose their reward.

Nearly all major cities in TX still have a mask mandate, and MI has a huge population that for political reasons still doesn't believe COVID is real.  They're not that far apart there.  

Also, the article states that cases in TX are still very high and rising:

""even as state health official reported more than 1,600 new cases of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus Sunday.""

Fortunately, a majority of the most vulnerable elderly are now vaccinated, so that is having the effect of reducing hospitalizations (vs last year) all over the US.

What may be different is that MI is struggling to get seniors vaccinated in major cities. Poor transit/mass transit options, limited vaccination sites in some areas, strong distrust of govt. - are certainly hindering efforts, along with a strong prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant. They're unfortunately seeing hospitalizations rise now. Which sucks.

TX may end up having trouble with growing variant prevalence. Even with low hospitalizations, as the prevalence of B.1.1.7 or P1 continues to increase, they may end up with similar problems to MI. (high B.1.1.7, rising hospitalizations among younger people - which is an effect of b.1.1.7).

I'm unsure what changed.

This is kind of thinking that is going to keep us from returning to life as we knew it.

Trying to force people to wear masks forever or permanently enforcing capacity cuts at restaurants or concert venues or sporting events doesn't make those deaths mean something. I get trying to be high minded and trying to feel like you're helping but you can go too far.

You're arguing that people FLED to California? Are you that delusional? People were fleeing FROM that poorly run state since the start. Colorado has been flooded with them. It actually gives CA an advantage...

Explain why there isn't a correlation between strict NPIs and deaths per capita, as the data suggests. Explain why the per capita case curves look nearly identical when comparing the US and Germany or different regions of the US. Explain why TX and FL are actually fared much better than CA and heavy lockdown states. Explain why the UK and Peru did so bad yet had some of the strictest NPIs. Peru actually had a head start as they were in the southern hemisphere and cases didn't start exploding until their winter.

Australia and NZ are sparsely populated islands. All APAC countries actually fared extremely well regardless of NPIs. Seems like there is some pre existing immunity from SARS1 or other similar coronavirus. Probably partially genetic as well (can see this in the US data too).

My son is doing full distance learning and we decided to pull my daughter out of elementary school and home school this year after auditing her distance class last spring (it was pretty awful).  It's not perfect, but they are doing really well.  My daughter gets through her lessons in about 5-6 hours and has more time to simply read for pleasure.  This is the first year she's really enjoyed reading and she's become ravenous for books (She just finished the Harry Potter series after reading the Hobbit and now she's moving on to Frank Herbert and Neil Stephenson).  Her reading level has improved so much vs previous years that we're frankly a little worried about sending her back.  My son is having a tougher time with missing his friends, but academically he's actually improved vs previous years.  We sit down and use resources like Khan Academy to supplement the (sometimes insufficient) school resources and reteach things he's not picking up from the lecture format.

I think distance learning has really highlighted the chasm in training and organization between different teachers (and age doesn't necessarily correlate).  Some have figured out ways to work with the kids, keep them engaged in small groups and actively participate in class.   You know exactly what they expect every week and they post assignments and grades promptly using the school's preferred online tools.  Others are completely disorganized, have no idea how to use the school's electronic resources, and lack even basic communication skills.  They spend the entire hour talking at the kids, use a bizarre non-deterministic folder organization scheme for posting assignments (that of course can't be properly tracked using the school's online tools), and seemingly randomly change rules from week to week hoping something gets the kids to start paying attention to them.

I wish we would be more willing to adopt some of the techniques the Finnish use in their schools.

I don't think wearing masks has had any significant effect for a majority of people outside of healthcare where they get the good masks because even in lab (read: perfect) conditions masks are only around 50-70% effective, and have you seen how many people wear improperly-fitted masks or just wear them improperly in general? Do you know how many more forget to wash their hands and touch their eyes, nose, and ears? Even the biggest germaphobe I know who is taking this dead serious was having trouble remembering to adjust their mask and not touch their face even after a year of restrictions. They're generally useful, but I don't think masks helped the general populace very much. 

This could've been handled, not by lockdowns and mask mandates, but by being prepared. We simply weren't.

This is extremely gray. I don't think there is a wrong answer here. A few weeks won't make or break your daughter's future. A few weeks and a second vaccine also probably won't make or break yours, but I don't know your condition. FWIW, a single dose of the vaccine provides 80% efficacy, but again, I don't know if that holds for your condition. If you have cancer or take serious immunosuppressants, definitely wait the few weeks and get that second dose.

I think you've already taken the most important step for your daughter, which is recognizing that she's slipped in some areas. I'm not worried about kids like your daughter, because kids like your daughter have concerned parents who will get them active and get them caught up over summer and once things start to go back to normal. There are tons of other kids out there with parents who can't help their kids or don't recognize they need help. Those are the kids who really need school open now.

Like I said, I don't think there's a wrong answer. As long as you keep following social distancing guidelines for the next few weeks, you will *definitely* see the other side of this, and as long as you stay a concerned and active parent (which I'm sure you will), your daughter will make it out of this fine.

Kids are struggling emotionally (based on my conversations with dozens of children) mostly because they’re not seeing friends outside of school and they’re missing out on milestone events in school.

But instead of 1 or 2 people, 7 have died with a total of [22 identified cases.](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-56616119) And all of these cases received the AZ vaccine.

I think vaccine passports are such a bad idea for everyday things like bars, stores, events, etc... but a fantastic idea for the things we already use vaccination status for (e.g. employment, school, travel, etc...). Just give everyone a chance to get vaxxed and then we gotta move on. It'll be enough to slow the spread to a trickle (and areas with high anti-vaxxer populations have high immunity now anyway). I could be convinced otherwise with a great argument. I just haven't heard one yet.

We have another 2 months until everyone has access to COVID vaccines. Maybe 3 months if you think about some exceptional circumstances.

We're introducing a new precedent for discrimination (and disclosure of medical information) in venues that never did that before for about 2 months of relative safety for a small portion of people in some areas. The juice is not worth the squeeze.

People will say this is a slippery slope argument, but even this has some immediate ramifications. It also *is* also a slippery slope. This is not the first health issue to break down almost entirely along income, educational, and racial lines.

I think a lot of people think of anti-vaxxers universally as 55 year old Karens who drive Range Rovers and spend too much time on Facebook, but it's more likely to be poor black people or uneducated white people who, everything about them unchanged, would probably get vaccinated in a heartbeat with a different upbringing and better schooling.

Now, let's be real and acknowledge that vaccine requirements play a huge part in getting general compliance, and we should use them, but let's also recognize that requirements in schools, workplaces, and for travel are good enough, and they already have decent oversight/infrastructure when it comes to privacy and preventing discrimination.

Not exactly. 

By regulation, facilities like this aren't usually permitted to produce two vaccines at one facility. HHS - the relevant agency - has the discretion to waive that regulation. 

After provisionally allowing joint production, they have decided not to waive that regulation.

The Emergent facility is not yet approved to produce any vaccine. Due to Emergent's repeated poor performance, the government has decided that it won't approve an Emergent-run facility. 

It's really as simple as that. If Emergent owns the facility (I'm not sure that they do; they may just staff), they can either continue to occupy it and do nothing, or lease it to J&amp;J and at least make some money.

Vaccines are definitely personally protective, but they require herd immunity to be fully protective. Despite headlines rushing to say all the vaccines are fully protective against hospitalization and death, the reality is that they are not. Small sample sizes of at-risk groups in the trials led to low hospitalizations even in the placebo groups (most trials had well under 10 hospitalizations) so the confidence intervals on hospitalization are wide. Moderna even had two hospitalizations in its trial group (but there is no reason to believe Moderna is less effective than Pfizer - they just had bad luck). Real world protection from hospitalization and death from the mRNA vaccines will range somewhere between 87% and 98% depending on what studies you are looking at ([87%](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2101765). [97%](https://www.empr.com/home/news/pfizer-biontech-real-world-data-uk-variant-b-1-1-7-israel-ministry-of-health/)*). 

Any place where COVID is spreading endemically, I'd rather go somewhere that I know everyone is vaccinated. It furthers the personal protection of the vaccine with community protection. Plus, anything that encourages anti-vaxxers to stop being selfish and do the right thing is a win in my book. All it takes to end endemic spread of a deadly virus in the US is to take a simple shot and they're unwilling to do that out of some weird combination of ignorance and self-righteous selfishness. 


\* The 97% data is actually an example of the community protection. It's hard to read the underlying study as it is in Hewbrew (which is why I linked a news article), but the issue in the study is that the vaccinated population is seeing higher effectiveness because of community protection. Those who got the vaccine are more likely to hang around vaccinated individuals, whereas unvaccinated individuals are more likely to hang around unvaccinated ones (e.g., ultra-orthodox populations). This artificially increases apparent effectiveness because the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups have major risk exposure differences that cannot easily be controlled for.",,,1617574780,{},gte3w3t,False,t3_mk32en,False,True,t1_gtdvtly,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mk32en/youll_need_a_covid_vaccine_to_sit_inside_this/gte3w3t/,1617574791,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_f1901,False,False,,

Besides limiting attendance at big sporting events and some businesses still asking people to wear a mask, the majority of people around me are going about life as normal, and have been for months.  Most people around me dont even talk about Covid that much anymore unless it's about the vaccine.

Quickly rising with even moderate levels of activity. Where does this moisture end up?  (this is just breathing moisture not counting sweat)



 &gt; You can have the greatest mask in the world, if it's not fitted properly it'll be worse than a normal store bought mask that is well fitted.

Better fit will almost certainly make moisture issues worse. In fact, perhaps vast majority who ""have no problems"" are not wearing their masks correctly?

&gt; that can wear masks without a problem.

How do you know know that they have no problems? As opposed to not complaining about them?
Everyone I talked to who does even moderate exercise in mask says the same thing: they get wet.

That's not really accurate.

Regardless, my entire point is it is not black and white. We really should be moving forward with an understanding that different environments work better for different kids in different scenarios.

&gt; It did not. They did not surveillance test in November or January because no one was in school in person.

Do me a favor. Go to the [NYC Dept of Education COVID testing website here](https://testingresults.schools.nyc/) and go to page 297. From page 297 through pages 342 you will find the school by school level surveillance testing results for November 1st through 18th. Kids were in school in-person for half of November and they did testing. Now do me a favor and got to page 250 and look forward through to page 175. Look at all those surveillance testing results for in-person students and staff for January. Also, if you look some more on that site, you'll see there's also data from December. How's that possible? Because you're wrong yet again. [PK-5 reopened schools on December 7th](https://www.fox5ny.com/news/de-blasio-nyc-public-schools-to-begin-phased-reopening-dec-7) and kids were in-person and in school during December before winter break. That's because[ they ditched the 3% rule and moved on to the state level 9% rule](https://ny.chalkbeat.org/2020/12/8/22164030/nyc-school-reopening-shutdown-coronavirus). Wrong again.


And [here](https://gothamist.com/news/coronavirus-statistics-tracking-epidemic-new-york) you can check out and confirm that the NYC positivity rate was higher in January than it was in December which means that **community spread was worse in January than in December yet NYC schools continued to host in-person schooling with surveillance testing. **

&gt; They did not surveillance test when they were at 10%+

Wrong again. NYC never hit a 7 day rolling average of 10%+ positivity between November and now but there were a few days they hit 10% plus like January 12th when they hit 12.3%. But guess what, kids were in schools and surveillance testing was happening on that day. You can look at the results yourself [on page 221 here.](https://testingresults.schools.nyc/)

&gt; hiding an ongoing genocide

I have no problem believing a genocide is happening in Xinjiang.  Yes I believe the communist party is totally capable of doing that and leaving the borders to that remote province (that has a history of wanting to secede from China) closed to the outside world.  So we are on the same page there.  But... Beijing?  Shanghai?  And all of the other major cities in China where international news agencies all have presence?  If people are dying all over China because of covid, you'd think news would start leaking out on covid killing more people in China than the alleged genocide.  But no, not a single credible report over the past year except for the original outbreak in the city of Wuhan and the entire province getting sealed off.  Wuhan is now bustling like other major Chinese cities btw.

Your Miami analogy:  Do you think the Chinese even know what the first amendment is?  If there is any risk of dying from covid, do you think it is up to the Chinese people to say ""my life, my freedom"" and not wear masks, let alone partying inside a conference hall?

Netanyahu needed an success story for political reason . So he wanted to be very early when it comes to vaccinations.

The US said early one they would us there surply for there own people first.  I mean there would be India left but there exports are strict controlled and India doesn`t produce big masses of MNRA vaccines. 
So Netanyahu tried to ally with other EU-Staates ( the once without its own vaccine production) but they declined that they would make no seperate deals . 
So Netanyahu basically had to bet on Pfizer/Biontech and since he is an old Friend with the C.O. of Pfizer so he did bet on that vaccine very early on. And since Pfizer had an fabric in the EU he didn`t need weary about exports bans. 
But the most important thing is not the money he paid, he had something way more valuable. A lot of data and an healthcare system with the infrastructure to provide it. So Israel could in case become kinda the Phase 4 study for the entire world.

Whether or not hiding something is successful is inconsequential to the fact that there was an attempt to hide it. Most native Chinese people have no idea it happened or don't believe that it did, which is all the CCP really cares about. 

&gt;  But... Beijing? Shanghai? And all of the other major cities in China where international news agencies all have presence?

Members of the international press were recalled when the lockdowns began. There is very little coverage and requests to get more from the Chinese government are more difficult to be granted than pre-pandemic. 

&gt;  But no, not a single credible report over the past year except for the original outbreak in the city of Wuhan and the entire province getting sealed off. Wuhan is now bustling like other major Chinese cities btw.

Millions of people were traveling in and out of Wuhan during a period of time we now know COVID was actively spreading. We now know that just a few infected travelers can cause thousands of infections people within weeks of their arrival. Yet China's daily infection rates fared better than New Zealand and Australia - two far more isolated countries who are universally accepted of having the best containment response. That doesn't sound off to you? Not even a little bit? 

&gt; Do you think the Chinese even know what the first amendment is? If there is any risk of dying from covid, do you think it is up to the Chinese people to say ""my life, my freedom"" and not wear masks, let alone partying inside a conference hall?

It's absolutely relevant. We know how the virus spreads. Over 200,000 case in a month means you have a completely uncontained and freely spreading outbreak on your hands. For China to have the numbers they do now, they would have had to subject the *entire country* to a Wuhan-style lockdown with people bolted into their apartments. Their economic output does not reflect that they did that. 

And then there's the common sense element. If you accept that they lied in the beginning, why can't you accept that they are still lying now? You think they suddenly learned the error of their ways and will never lie again?

The biological sample was collected at the ""Sf. Ioan cel Nou"" Emergency County Hospital in Suceava, and the infected patient had a variant of the British strain (B.1.1.7) over which the E484K mutation occurred, making the virus resistant to vaccines, according to the latest scientific reports.  Technical clarification: To the 3 variants of concern known to originate from the UK (line B.1.1.7, name VOC20201201), South Africa (line B.1.351, name 501Y.V2 15) and Brazil (line P.1, name P.1), the Institute of Public Health in England added a new variant of the virus (line B.1.1.7 + E484K, name VOC20210202) in February. Although the number of cases identified with the new variant (B.1.1.7 + E484K) is currently relatively low (with only 43 cases reported in the UK Report of 1 April 2021), the main concern stems from the ability of variants that also contain the E484K mutation to show increased resistance to vaccine-generated antibodies, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the vaccine. In March, the new variant (B.1.1.7 + E484K) was also listed as a variant of concern (VoC) by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which monitors the epidemiological situation in the European Union. In a statement issued on Sunday 4 April by Reuters, concern was expressed about the spread of this variant to Japan, with around 70% of sequenced samples from a Tokyo hospital showing this mutation.

In the laboratory of the ""Ștefan cel Mare"" University of Suceava (USV), sequencing of 91 samples from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from Suceava, Cluj, Iași, Timiș and Botoșani counties has been carried out over the last two weeks. From the samples analysed, 88 new cases were detected belonging to the epidemiologically relevant strain B.1.1.7 (VOC 20201201), known to have originated in the UK, and one case belonging to strain B.1.1.7 + E484K.  They are geographically distributed as follows: 44 out of 44 samples selected from Suceava county, 22 out of 25 samples selected from Cluj county, 17 out of 17 samples selected from Iasi county, 3 out of 3 samples selected from Timis county, and 2 out of 2 samples selected from Botoșani county in this round of sequencing.  Looking back at the 4 rounds of sequencing carried out in the first 3 months of this year, we observe that the coronavirus variant originating from the UK, B.1 .1.7, characterised by increased transmissibility, was identified as follows: in the first round of sequencing, in one sample out of a total of 20 sequenced, in the second round of sequencing, in 14 samples out of 47 sequenced, in the third round of sequencing, in 65 samples out of 101 sequenced, and in this round, in 88 samples out of 91 sequenced. This indicates a scenario of epidemiological evolution similar to that in the UK, where the increased transmissibility of the new strain (B.1.1.7) caused the new variant to become dominant within weeks and contribute to the accelerated increase in COVID-19 cases in late 2020 and early this year.

Any answer you get that is either ""yes"" or ""no"" isn't 100% correct, for now (though that may be changing very soon!). For now, we have only ""probably not, it looks like vaccinated people don't transmit the virus, not that they can't ever transmit it"".  The best we have now is that [""it's really *really* unlikely"".](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm?s_cid=mm7013e3_w)  Getting less likely by the day.

Can vaccinated people get infected?  Yes, sometimes, it's a lot less likely than in unvaccinated people. 

Is it a big deal if they do? No. Cases in people who are vaccinated are much milder.

Even variants? At this point, a breakthrough infection by one variant is the same as any other for vaccinated people.

Also, you'll notice that any reputable person talking about this subject always says ""may be able to spread"", or ""maybe"", or ""we don't know if"". And that's because there is a small chance that vaccinated people will be able to spread the virus. But it's not a big chance. Doctors, scientists, and regulators are being very careful with their language on this subject, some would argue they're being too careful. That said, if they were to say that ""vaccinated people cannot spread the virus"", and then we find out that in some situations that vaccinated people have spread the virus, [that would end up worse for the experts than if they hedge for a while.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/los8r9/daily_discussion_thread_february_21_2021/goa8cu0/) So at least to me, the way these experts are framing it seems pretty reasonable, you just have to put yourself in their shoes.

**Additional Thoughts/Cool Stuff**

Even the shittiest masks do seem to work, [but why?](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/md436k/another_explanation_for_why_cloth_masks_reduce/)

Testing and the Positivity Rate: It's been said a lot in other subs that the positivity rate should go up over time as more people are vaccinated and don't require testing. Last year, it was *the* metric to watch, but it will likely wane quickly in importance as overall testing drops.  Don't necessarily worry about sudden high positivity rates, as mass testing will likely drop off pretty quickly, particularly as testing sites are converted to vaccination sites. 

We may want to use our newly found testing and sequencing capacity to test and sequence a higher proportion of flu samples.  This might give us a head start on which flu genetics are circulating, and help eliminate a flu or two.  We're in the single digits of flu cases most places, which is awesome!

**Which vaccine should I get?**

When someone asks me what my favorite beer is, the answer is always the same.

It's the one in front of me.

So get the first vaccine you can, the differences are pretty minor.


[**Conclusions**](https://gfycat.com/cleantalkativedassie)

Okay, so the vaccines reduce infections, and if someone gets an infection after getting vaccinated, they have fewer and reduced symptoms.  This currently seems to also be true with post vaccination infection with any of the known variants. We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with mild symptoms spread only slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well. 

In other words: A reduction in symptoms is at least correlated with a reduction in the ability to spread the virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections and symptoms in those who do get infected. Therefore, vaccines should reduce spread.

Regarding side effects of the vaccine:

Nobody is saying there aren't side effects. There are clearly side effects. I'm not even saying there aren't side effects from the vaccine that could last for years. The effects of an infection may not show up for a while, [and we know they can last a long time](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m4jhpf/rapid_implementation_of_a_cohort_for_the_study_of/), most notably a loss of sense of smell.

I'm saying that we'd find out about all the side effects within a few months. There won't be side effects that suddenly show up six months after vaccination that haven't already shown up in some people.

If you have an example of a side effect from any vaccine where side effects not seen within the first four months were suddenly found over four months post-vaccination, I'd change the wording in my post.

I'll tell you though, I've still not gotten an example of a vaccine side effect that didn't show up in at least some people until way after the vaccine was administered.

We had a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic change the rules and suddenly life got much easier for introverts and much harder for extroverts.  We are getting to the end of that societal change and introverts are having to deal with their lives about to get harder again.

Imagine an inverted pandemic, some disease that forced people to stay home and scientists invented a medicine that could let everyone go out but it would only work for 1-2 years.  Suddenly, as an extrovert, you can go out on the town, have fun, do all the things you love to do, and you find that life is much better.  How would you feel when that medication starts to wear off and the world returns to everyone staying at home, probably not great.

I think the best outcome wouldn’t be for us to devolve to our normal tribalism and argue about which is better, being introverted or extroverted, and dunk on each other.  Instead, we could recognize that what constitutes a fulfilling, happy life is different for different people and strive to build a society in which the most people can be happy.

For introverts during the pandemic, it seemed so difficult to wrap our heads around what the heck was so difficult for extroverts.  You are being asked to stay home, watch Netflix, read a book, get a hobby, etc.  Things that introverts generally find pleasant were somehow tortuous for our extroverted friends.

As we head back into an extroverted society, extroverts are scratching their heads about why their introverted friends are unhappy.  Just come out for a drink, go to a club and dance, have a night out at the bowling alley (I’m reaching here, reminder, I’m an introvert, so I’m sorta just imaging what extroverts miss doing).   Now the shoe is on the other foot, and extroverts may feel inclined to dunk on introverts too as things return to normal.  I recall pre-pandemic plenty of times being forced into situations I didn’t like because it was “normal” to go to a super loud bar and if I declined I was dunked on, nicely, by my extroverted peers.

So let’s take this moment when our differences are on display, and instead of meeting each other with derision or hatred, reach for compassion and understanding.  Realize that for some introverts, the society we are returning to is as difficult as the year you’ve just spent.

**Study Title:** COVID-Cog: Cognitive Outcomes after COVID-19 Infection

**Study Description:** There is an urgent need to understand the neurocognitive impact of COVID-19. As there are millions of people globally surviving COVID-19 there are key questions remain: does COVID-19 infection result in significant cognitive impairment? Is the burden of cognitive impairment greater in those who require ICU stay vs. those hospitalized outside the ICU vs. those in the community?  And are there interactions with sex, age and medical risk factors that result in greater impact in some populations? To answer these questions, we need thousands of people from around the world, who have tested positive at some point for COVID-19, to participate in our study. The study itself consists of a survey that asks questions about COVID history, demographics, lifestyle, and general health, followed by a series of online games that measure different aspects of cognitive functioning; altogether, this takes less than 1 hour. We will also invite participants to complete the study again after 3 and 12 months, to examine how COVID-related impacts on cognition and general health change over time. **Individuals who have had a confirmed positive test for COVID-19, are over 18 years of age, and are fluent in English, French, or Spanish are invited to participate.**

**Study Title:** Early Predictors and Longitudinal Course of Covid-19 Related Grief: A Longitudinal Online Study

**Study Description:** The Complicated Grief Program at Massachusetts General Hospital is conducting a research study related to grief following the death of a loved one to COVID-19. We understand that this is a very difficult time for those who have lost loved ones to COVID-19 and offer our condolences.

By participating in a brief internet-based survey research study, you can contribute to understanding the impact of losing a loved one to COVID-19 to better address the needs of those who are grieving.

We invite interested participants to complete now an online survey about the circumstances of the death and your experience of bereavement that will take less than 30 minutes. In addition, we will send you follow-up surveys that will take about 15 minutes to complete, up to 8 times over the course of the next two years. **Adults aged 18 or older living in the United States, who has lost a loved one to Covid-19 in the past 24 months (according to their report), with Internet access and minimal reading skills will be eligible to participate.**

**Study Description:** iReport-Covid is a Web-based survey distributed all over the world for people to voluntarily self-report on their COVID-19 status, including elements like symptoms, testing, received  medical treatment, quarantine, etc. The submitted surveys are posted as-is (i.e., exactly as completed by the individuals) in a public blockchain (the Algorand blockchain), ensuring open, unrestricted access to the data in a permanent and immutable form. It serves to inform current studies as well as store valuable data for future research into this and other epidemics. We believe this is a novel approach that takes advantage of the worldwide reach, decentralization, open access and integrity properties of public blockchains, and will become a valuable data collection model in the public health field (and beyond). At the time of writing the survey has been filled out by over 16,000 people from 130 different countries.

CURE-19 is a dedicated platform for running at-home COVID-19 clinical trials. **Via CURE-19, any patient in the United States, no matter where they live, can sign up for the platform and start participating in our studies right at home.** There is no travel needed, and patients can be part of driving scientific discoveries, get free genomic and microbiome testing.

**The registry is intended to give researchers data on real-world disease progression, treatment, and healthcare utilization data for COVID-19.** This data closes the gap in what is publicly available today, which lacks information about patients prior to testing positive, and how they are treated, such as with off-label prescriptions and various bedside techniques. This will also fill gaps in detail on their clinical outcomes like concomitant medications, comorbidities, and socioeconomic status.

Look at almost any scientific article in this sub, local COVID subs, or one of the anti-lockdown subs. If it reaffirms their biases, they take that one article as absolute truth and ignore the preponderance of evidence showing the opposite. You'll see tons of comments saying, ""Oh wow! Who'da thunk it? Where are all the people who said otherwise now?"" Meanwhile, the people who said otherwise are in the thread where an expert goes over the 50+ studies saying the opposite.

Unfortunately, I've also had to re-evaluate many things I regarded as absolute truths before this. Reddit has this problem politically. These things *always* break down along political lines. You can't believe anything you read that ties into politics on reddit. It's unfortunately extremely manipulated and has become a positive feedback loop. Even things I held to be unadulterated truths and are treated as such on reddit (typically things related to single payer healthcare, minimum wage, or tax proposals) you simply have to go outside of reddit to get the full story on. That's not to say the reddit stance is wrong, but it's highly exaggerated and meant to manufacture outrage. Basically, ""the benefit of [political stance] is such an outright truth that anyone opposing it is an incorrigible demon. You should be outraged at anyone who opposes it because they are akin to mass murderers working for corporate benefit.""

It's a nasty manipulation tactic, and it's led to a lot of downvotes even from extremely measured/sensible comments.

**Study Title:** COVID-19 MMR Titer Study

**Study Description:** If you have had COVID-19 confirmed through testing either while you had it or later through an antibody test — whether or not you ever had actual symptoms — you may apply to join this study. If you are chosen, you will be asked to go to the nearest Quest Diagnostics lab (usually within a 15 to 30 minute drive of most locations). No compensation for mileage or transportation will be provided. You will be given an MMR Titer test at no charge; this is a simple blood test. This study involves the research of MMR titer levels to determine if the level of measles, mumps, and/or rubella titers of COVID-19 patients may correlate with the severity of their COVID-19 cases.

**Study Title:** Center for Innovation COVID-19 Survey

**Study Description:** The Center for Innovation seeks to utilize this unique moment in history to study issues related to public information integrity and trust, along with access to medical needs and opportunistic industry behaviors in a pandemic. This research is designed to analyze the events and ultimately provide lessons that can strengthen both governmental responses and the institutions responsible for public health and safety. In particular, commentators are suggesting that economic, social, and political characteristics of the nation may change substantially as a result of Covid-19. This study seeks to create effective recommendations for policymakers as these changes occur. Previous studies have documented the important role of trust in institutions when attempting to translate institutional policy into ground level action, and this study seeks to expand and build on this work through surveys examining micro levels of trust in various institutions and public health responses. This research will then seek to place this micro data into the context of institutional responses to the pandemic. **Anyone living in the United States who has reached the age of majority can participate in this study.

It also sort of... doesn't do that, at least probably not in the sense you're thinking. Chances are everytime you've had the flu since childhood your body has had some idea of how to fight it. When H1N1 popped up in 2009 most older people were relatively immune from previous flu shots or illness with similar influenza strains. Obviously it didn't prevent all older people from getting it, but they had enough immunity that it wasn't a huge deal.

Same with COVID/variants. You might still get COVID at some point, and there might be variants that some vaccines don't prevent at all. However, chances are the actual infection will be blunted compared to getting COVID this year while completely naive.

It's also a good reason to get a flu shot every year. Think of building immunity as building a repertoire of tools against similar infections, not a 1 to 1 correlation with that exact bug. Getting your flu shot consistently will build a diverse set of T cell responses against common influenza antigens. Your flu shot from last year probably won't prevent you from getting flu this year, but if they misjudge the strain for the current year, a previous injection might blunt the worst effects of your illness.",,,1617639926,{},gtgvli8,False,t3_mkc866,False,True,t1_gtgqgt9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mkc866/dont_believe_the_hype_about_covid_super_strains/gtgvli8/,1617640577,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_akx98w06,False,False,,

""the way we've always done"" is not really that great to begin with. America is a very unhealthy society, health care was gobbling 17% of GDP even before the pandemic, access to that healthcare is inequitable, and it's too easy for anyone to externalize the cost of their bad health decisions.

A COVID hospitalization costs on average $70,000. That's 5 years pay at a federal minimum wage job. What about a person with long-term lung and heart damage, how much does that cost? Now factor in lost productivity, etc. How do we ""we as a society"" pay for all this? There's a great economic case for trying to keep COVID infections as low as possible until we reach herd immunity, or we can just decide to play now and (make someone else) pay later.

As an aside, this is the first year in a while I haven't got the flu. That's a week out of my year I wasn't miserably sick, didn't miss several days of work. Also, 50,000 people didn't die of the flu after weeks of hospitalization, many more didn't need intensive care to recover, and I'm not going to have to pay for that with health insurance premiums or taxes for Medicare. Is there any change to our ""normal"" lives that justifies keeping things this way?

It is not discrimination against someone based on ideology because members of the ideology will be both vaccinated and unvaccinated. Plus, it is not whether businesses should be able to ""do whatever they want"" to certain customers. It's the opposite, whether businesses should be able to refuse certain would-be customers, choosing to do nothing to them.

But I get your point and have questions for you. 

* Do you think that businesses should ever be able to refuse customers that are able to pay when goods/services are available? 

* If yes, under what circumstances can they be refused (eg if you think people with pets, lit cigarettes, or no shirt can be prohibited, what makes them prohibitable)?

* Does a business' rights change when the interaction with customers takes place on/in property that is owned by the business (ie what is different between a business and a homeowner when defining trespassers)?

You took an ""I don't know"" and erroneously made a conclusive statement in the opposite direction when you said ""The vaccine still only helps YOU. No one else."" If we don't know if it prevents transmission, that does not mean it DOESN'T. It also doesn't mean that it's equally likely that it does or doesn't.

* Extroverts
* Social Introverts
* Anti-Social People (whether this is caused by social anxiety, general dickishness, etc)

I'm definitely in the Social Introverts category, and I have missed activities but found the pandemic to be relatively bearable.  The pandemic itself, like the disease, is not something I can find any good in.  The response to the pandemic though has had lots of terrible aspects, but there are a few good things.

We found out that many of the jobs that just ""had to be done in office"" could actually be done remotely with no negative impact on productivity.  For myself that means that I can work from home and avoid commuting, have more time with my family, etc.  For others it means that they can work for companies without having to move to where they are physically located, and for companies it means expanding their talent pool to anyone with an internet connection.  

&gt;Talking about the pandemic in positive terms just doesn’t make sense to me

The pandemic is not positive, but it was a forcing function.  Forcing functions, whether they are deadlines, or personal goals, or pandemics, often unearth positive and negative things.  Before I went to college I wouldn't have imagined learning all the cool stuff I learned about mathematics, but to get the degree I wanted, I was forced to take a bunch of classes and learned that some things I'm awful at, looking at you differential equations, and some things I wouldn't have every considered studying were deeply fascinating and rewarding, looking at you abstract algebra.  

I think trying to find the good in bad situations is a normal part of human life.  That divorce was terrible, but it led me to my soul mate.  I never would have learned how much I love punk rock if it weren't for that flat tire.  Third example. 

&gt;Being socially anxious isn’t the same thing as being introverted, and I think people with social anxiety should take steps to cure that anxiety.

I completely agree with this, feeling drained from social experiences and needing to recharge is super different from wanting to avoid them altogether because of anxiety and those suffering from social anxiety should seek treatment, not isolation.

This is true, and it is what a lot of introverts do, decline invitations and stay home.  That doesn't erase the social expectations and obligations, there are many events and situations where declining an invitation is frowned upon.  There are often social obligations that can't be declined, I can't very well decline going into the office, I mean I can, but then the boss will decline paying me, and I require money for food and shelter and medicine, you know, luxuries.

I think that there is a wide swath of introverts that were pleased to see the rules change in a way that they need not feel ashamed or judged for their preferences that still care about their extroverted friends and family and feel bad that they have suffered so much during this pandemic.

I'm not arguing for some sort of permanent lockdown or even looking down at extroverts for struggling during this time.

In another reply /u/tythousand rightly pointed out that introverts do enjoy social activities, and I agree with that, it's just what proportion.  I find that society has placed the ""normal"" amount of socializing higher than I prefer, whether that's professional obligations, family obligations, friendly invites etc.  I can decline these, but there is a cost associated, there is a stigma attached to never socializing or not liking to socialize, and that weighs on some people.  That was the weight that was removed, not that I was being forced at gun point to go to a loud party I didn't care for or a BBQ I had no interest in being at, but that if I declined to go I would hurt someone's feelings and as a caring human being I didn't want to do that.

""Set up damn boundaries"" sounds like a really reasonable thing to do as long as the place you want to set them is a place society agrees with.  If you want to place them further or closer than society is comfortable with, you pay some social penalty.  Some people are fine with that, there are creepy hermits on one end of the spectrum that set that boundary way too high and there are the Logan Pauls of the world that are more than happy to shove a camera in your face, throw an arm around you, and shout their opinions loudly that have set their boundaries far too low, and everything in between.

The point of my original post is that as a society we could expand the range of acceptable boundaries a bit further for some introverts seeing as so many of them found this time to have positive aspects and that introverts should also want the extroverts of the world to be happy too and understand why this time was so difficult for them.

[],,NotTheEconAdamSmith,,,,,,[],"I can see why you feel that way, but I would like to respond here. First, the ""media"" is made up of countless news outlets, including television news shows, startup websites and traditional ones, bloggers, old journalists who go on their own on new media, fading newspapers, and so on. The level of quality varies with each and with the reporters working for the various outlets. Some of them are young and will learn, some are older and will make mistakes, some are just sloppy always and don't care, but I think and hope the latter is in the minority.

Second, most journalists are not scientists or doctors (why would they be? you can make much more as a scientist or doctor). So, they, the legitimate media outlets, report on what they are told, which is why much of the back and forth your refer to exists.

Third, the information in this pandemic, as one epidemiologist told me early on, is constantly changing. ([https://www.thestreet.com/latest-news/questions-about-coronavirus-still-baffle-experts-after-wild-week-of-headlines](https://www.thestreet.com/latest-news/questions-about-coronavirus-still-baffle-experts-after-wild-week-of-headlines))

And finally, there's an unfortunate trend in media, which most journalists have to follow to some degree or another, and that's writing for hits. The worst part of that is it means simply rewriting another story that's ""trending"" so that your news outlet has it. This is quick and dirty work in which getting original commentary is not rewarded, and in many places is not expected. You can see that if there was a problem in the original story, it could be magnified by other voices, or, if a reporter was in a hurry with a full plate, might insert an error. Making matters worse is that editors and copy editors are fewer and fewer these days, deadlines are minutes and not full days, and no one really has the luxury of looking back.

Fortunately, because the web is not print -- in which errors could only be remedied by letters to the editor or a day-late correction -- readers have the ability now to contact a writer or publication and point out an error, perceived or real, and the story could be updated or modified.",,,1617655658,{},gthu6ol,False,t3_mkc866,False,True,t1_gthira8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mkc866/dont_believe_the_hype_about_covid_super_strains/gthu6ol/,1617658101,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_arpi82qy,False,False,,

If you're losing sleep over it, go ahead and get tested and be cautious until you get your results, but I would bet you're fine.

The typical advice is to wait to get tested until 6-7 days after a suspected exposure to reduce false negatives, but assuming you do have it and are showing symptoms, I think the risk of a false negative is pretty low.  The CDC just has a blanket statement that [anyone with symptoms should get tested](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#Testing), without any caveats about time since exposure.

It is more about how the virus just naturally spreads. If you look at the graphs of infections from previous breakouts they look remarkably similar to Covid, you get a curve with 2-4 increasingly tall peaks, and then finally it drops sharply off at the end. For example here it is for SARS:

https://www.goldsteinepi.com/blog/an-update-on-coronavirus-disease/index.html

For Ebola:

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6850a3.htm

You can see the exact same pattern.

I am no expert in this (but I would love to be) but the virus comes in increasing waves probably because of the exponential nature of the spread. But then at some point, enough people have been exposed that the virus can't spread as easily.

It doesn't take complete ""herd immunity"". The virus probably spreads at certain parts of the community with a lot of human traffic like grocery stores and stores and restaurants. You don't need herd immunity everywhere in the area to slow the spread, you just need it at these choke points. So when the entire state is at say 40-50% immunity the choke points are probably at 60-70% or more and that is enough to slow the spread.

People will do what they want and motivation only works up to a point and NOT on everyone. Pushing the vaccine on people has the opposite effect and only causes more people to choose NOT to get vaccinated. 

Whether you like it or not, this has to be a choice. People are going to choose what they want in their body.

In fact: Japan is basically doing fuck all to stop the virus and they're doing much better than the most successful countries in Europe.

Australia shows that a lockdown works as long as you have proper border control (something which Europe lacks internally). It's likely impossible for Europe to have that kind of lockdown required to handle the virus once it gets into Europe.

Well this is a leap in logic. The original two comments were about what they *can* do. ""Should"" is suggestion. There's a big difference between what you ""can"" and ""should"" do. You should keep that in mind because that's significant here.

For example, some people say Biden **should** institute a nation-wide mask mandate. However, given how our laws and constitution are set up, he **can** not.  ""Can"" describes the ability to do something, ""should"" describes whether or not doing that thing is a good idea.

Now that the language lesson is out of the way.

&gt; It should be up to the employees discretion what they want to wear, yes?

No, it should not be up to the employees' discretion on what to wear, in a general sense. We allow businesses to have dress codes that don't infringe on people's personal freedoms to an extent. They **can** mandate you wear a suit and tie.

Your claim is weird. Private businesses **cannot** do whatever they please. There are a variety of rules and regulations that our country imposes on businesses.

Regardless, the image you posted does not suggest that covid is not a risk to children. It suggests that if you have 100 kids with flu and 100 kids with covid, more kids will die from flu. I will grant you that. The problem is that flu in a normal year does not spread like covid is right now. Way, way more people are getting infected with covid this winter than get infected with flu in a normal year. That’s why the number of kids who died of covid this year was higher than the number who normally die of flu. Hopefully once the vaccines give us herd immunity, that won’t be the case. Once covid rates are low, I agree that we don’t need to worry much about kids. But we aren’t there yet, and I don’t think we will be until kids have a vaccine.

Each virus that your body encounters requires a novel response. Being exposed to meningitis will not make your body more capable of dealing with the annual flu. Being exposed to HPV will not make you more resilient to varicella.

Since each virus that your body encounters requires a novel response, you cannot simply strengthen your immunity by electing to expose yourself to a variety of different viruses.

Getting vaccinated trains your immune system on how to respond to a novel pathogen *before* it encounters it. Your immune system still has to do the work, it is just able to do it in a controlled environment. When you do encounter that pathogen, your immune system will know exactly what to do and mount an incredibly effective and rapid response. 

Regarding annual vaccines, the reason we have them is because of virus variants. Viruses are constantly changing over time and the more successful versions of them are much more likely to continue to spread. In the course of a year, a variant of a virus may be biologically different enough form the previous years version that your immune system won't know how to deal with it.

In hotspots, the answer from March-May 2020 was lockdowns. No doubt. Locking down *early* was key, and the data bares that out more than any other metric. The one unifying thing among places that did well was early intervention.

Then, the emphasis needed to be on sustainable measures, like testing and contact tracing. We barely took advantage of the summer, and we failed to even try to develop robust testing programs, even in non-US, western nations.

Basic principles of public health tell you that the best interventions are automatic or enforceable. Social distancing is not enforceable and defies human nature. It was bound to be a failure.

We could have implemented far fewer measures with similar results from limited social distancing (e.g. Florida/Texas or even South Dakota, if you really look at the numbers) while moving mountains for testing/contact tracing, using methods like pooled testing for PCR or developing antigen tests (hundreds of designs were proposed/demonstrated by academic labs) to get volume up. That would have gotten us fewer deaths and cases while costing far, far less.

Earlier lockdown followed by a better emphasis on enforceable measures would have been a much better approach than shaming people for activities they were always going to do anyway (or couldn't avoid at all). Ultimately, our approach was horrendous, and we need to take a good look at why instead of blaming the other side and then closing a playground as a political move.",,,1617637157,{},gtgpggo,False,t3_mkbp7c,False,True,t1_gtfswlf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mkbp7c/cdc_suicides_decreased_in_2020/gtgpggo/,1617637461,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_akx98w06,False,False,,

Exposed household contacts (EHC) are people who live with someone with COVID-19  and therefore have an increased chance of contracting the virus. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, meaning subjects will be randomly assigned to receive LGG or a placebo (an inactive substance given in the same form as the active substance) and will not know which product they are receiving. Participation in this study entails taking LGG/placebo for 28 days, responding to questionnaires, and providing stool and nasal swab samples. 

**To participate, individuals must be asymptomatic, at least 1 year old, live with a household contact who has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the previous 3 days, and be willing to stop taking any current probiotics/not take any other probiotics while on the study.**

**Study Title:** Working in times of crisis

**Study Description:** In many professions, such as nursing and medical care, as well as work at the supermarket, the work loads are increasing drastically. In other professions, daily work routines have to be reorganized in the home office while simultaneously taking care of children. Our research project intends to investigate these radical changes and their effects on workers over time. The results will be used to develop recommendations for companies and employees on how to deal with situations of crisis. We will provide participants with personal feedback on their well-being as they progress through this crisis, confidentially and automatically, after data collection finished.

Woke up again around 4:30am burning hot, then laid around on the couch alternating between streaming TV shows and taking naps for most of the day. The fever cycle mostly quit by about 6pm, but I felt pretty beat up the rest of the evening.

Woke up Sunday feeling a bit fatigued still, but well enough to take a day-trip out of town with my GF. 

All said, from Friday afternoon to Monday morning I'm feeling back to 100%. Didn't inconvenience my life much at all.

## Highlights

* Pseudoviral SARS-CoV-2 induces the acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide system
* Inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase prevents cellular infection with SARS-CoV-2
* Neutralization of ceramide *in vitro* blocks infection with pseudoviral SARS-CoV-2

## Summary

The acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide system plays an important role in bacterial and viral infections. Here, we report that either pharmacological inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase with amitriptyline, imipramine, fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, or maprotiline or genetic downregulation of the enzyme prevents infection of cultured cells or freshy isolated human nasal epithelial cells with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudoviral particles (pp-VSV) presenting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike), a bona fide system mimicking SARS-CoV-2 infection. Infection activates acid sphingomyelinase and triggers a release of ceramide on the cell surface. Neutralization or consumption of surface ceramide reduces infection with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. Treating volunteers with a low dose of amitriptyline prevents infection of freshly isolated nasal epithelial cells with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. The data justify clinical studies investigating whether amitriptyline, a safe drug used clinically for almost 60 years, or other antidepressants that functionally block acid sphingomyelinase prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.",,,1617635372,{},gtglhpq,True,t3_mkmvzv,False,True,t3_mkmvzv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mkmvzv/pharmacological_inhibition_of_acid/gtglhpq/,1617635479,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,

&gt; Most native Chinese people have no idea it happened or don't believe that it did

... But it is not of the same scale.  Covid impacts everyone, if personal friends and relatives start dying from covid, wouldn't enough people start working around the online censorship on Chinese social media and talk about it?  Take a look at this https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-55355401 - the Chinese citizens seem to have managed to form a movement to voice out their concerns on CCP downplaying the heroism of the doctor who broke out the news of the initial outbreak but was slicenced by local authorities.  If there is a much more serious issue of people mysteriously dying all over the place, do you think none of their friends and relatives would take to platforms like weibo (the Chinese instagram) and share what's happening (and these messages subsequently getting picked up by BBC for example?)

&gt; Members of the international press were recalled when the lockdowns began. There is very little coverage and requests to get more from the Chinese government are more difficult to be granted than pre-pandemic. 

... I just don't think this is true.  Especially with covid being something that happens ""out in the field"" and with the press still having strong presence in major Chinese cities (honestly I haven't heard of any reporters / journalists leaving China, not over covid concerns anyway), it just seems absurd to me that any negative news on Covid from China wouldn't be reported like a million times by now (I mean by western media knowing full well these reports are what people want to read amid all the asian hate).  Again just take a look at the BBC report above.  

&gt; That doesn't sound off to you?

Actually no.  Partially because of the Chinese government.  Love it or hate it, they do have the power to order an entire county / district / even city of people to totally isolate for a period of time to starve off the virus.  This in addition to the Chinese people having the experience to wear masks from the SARS pendemic just a decade or so ago.  Self-disiplince.

&gt; Not even a little bit?

Really no.  Many asian countries have conspicuously lower numbers of infections and deaths.  China isn't the only one.  Taiwan has had like close to zero cases for the past 6 months or so for example.  People in these Asian countries focus on wearing their masks instead of crying out for freedom.

&gt;  Chinese citizens are discouraged from talking about the pandemic 

Again take a look at that BBC article.  I am sure u can find similar reports from say CNN also.  Suppression can be done only to a certain extent... Not if many people all over the country have friends and family all dying from covid.  

I mean it will certainly be more than the 80,000 cases of reported deaths in China, but nowhere like the scale of places like Brazil or even the US if u ask me.

Again I have no problem saying ""fuck CCP"", but I do believe they have covid pretty much under control, judging by some of the things I mentioned above plus a lot of other objective factors such as economic figures (investors all over the world aren't stupid)",,,1617635283,{},gtglb1h,False,t3_mkbe0d,False,True,t1_gtgdako,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mkbe0d/china_reports_biggest_daily_covid19_case_jump_in/gtglb1h/,1617635382,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_wcejz,False,False,,

Viruses evolve regardless of our preventative measures and understanding of how they work. We don't know the efficacy of the vaccine against the current new strains being found seemingly every day. We don't know how long the vaccination lasts. 

Threatening to force others to take the vaccine could lead to more conspiracy theories, even greater push back, and possibly more of those who have yet to be vaccinated choosing not to get the vaccine.

In this case educating people and giving them time to see it's ok to get the vaccine will encourage many on the fence.

For most purposes, we are both Goodyear Melt. I'll get my 2nd dose of vaccine on Wednesday and for reasons I'd rather not discuss, he's not at all vaccinated. What is stopping me from giving him, or him taking from me, my vaccine card to register his passport? Or even registering my own passport and giving him access? Even pressed for further identification, he would be able to prove that legally he is in fact, Goodyear Melt, even if he's not the one that is vaccinated. You don't think there will be a black market for super common names like John Brown or Bob Smith? 

And that's not even getting into the fact that the CDC cards themselves, that will presumably be what is used to link and register the passport, is also easily faked. I'm not telling you to look but you can print them off online and write whatever you want on them.

&gt; We show that most of the high among-county variance is explained by four factors (R2 = 0.70): the timing of outbreak, population size, population density, and spatial location.

&gt; For predictions of future spread, population density and spatial location are important, and for the latter we show that SARS-CoV-2 strains containing the G614 mutation to the spike gene are associated with higher rates of spread. 

&gt; Finally, the high predictability of R0 allows extending estimates to all 3109 counties in the conterminous 48 states. The high variation of R0 argues for public health policies enacted at the county level for controlling COVID-19.

&gt; As a new, apparently more transmissible version of the virus that causes COVID-19 has appeared in several countries, new research finds that the transmissibility of viral strains and the population density of a region will play big roles in how vaccination campaigns can help towns and cities return to more normal activities. The findings suggest that directing vaccines toward densely populated counties would help to interrupt transmission of the disease.

&gt; Beyond the contact and respiratory transmission of the COVID-19 virus, it has recently been reported in the literature that humidity, temperature, and air pollution may be effective in spreading the virus. However, taking the measurements regionally suspects the accuracy or validity of the data. In this research, climate values (temperature, humidity, number of sunny days, wind intensity) of 81 provinces in Turkey were collected in March 2020. Also, the population, population density of the provinces, and average air pollution data were taken.

|AstraZeneca|7.5|12.4 - 15.4|

 Moderna released on modernatx :

This Phase 2/3 two-part, open label, dose-escalation, age  de-escalation (Part 1) and randomized, observer-blind,  placebo-controlled expansion study (Part 2) will evaluate the safety,  tolerability, reactogenicity and effectiveness of two doses of mRNA-1273  given 28 days apart. The Company intends to enroll approximately 6,750  pediatric participants in the U.S. and Canada ages 6 months to less than 12 years.

In Part 1, each participant ages two years to less than 12 years may  receive one of two dose levels (50 μg or 100 μg). Also in Part 1, each  participant ages six months to less than 2 years may receive one of  three dose levels (25 μg, 50 μg and 100 μg). An interim analysis will be  conducted to determine which dose will be used in Part 2, the  placebo-controlled expansion portion of the study. Participants will be  followed through 12 months after the second vaccination. Vaccine  effectiveness will either be inferred through achieving a correlate of  protection, if established, or through immunobridging to the young adult  (ages 18-25) population.

I doubt we get much more than that to actually show up, so through mid June we'll be trailing off as people are just coming in for their second shots.

These things while enjoyable are draining to most introverts, that's more or less the key difference between extroverts and introverts.  Broadly speaking, extroverts find social activities recharging and restorative, introverts find them more draining, both types of people find them enjoyable. 

By way of analogy, I like ice cream, but if society had decided that the ""normal"" thing to do is eat a big bowl of ice cream every day I wouldn't like that even though I like ice cream.  I prefer to eat ice cream at most once a week or even less often than that.  If someone like to have a bowl of ice cream every day, more power to them, enjoy that ice cream, it's quite good, that's just too much ice cream for me.  

&gt;Even if you don't enjoy doing those things, I can't imagine why you would be unhappy seeing other people do those things.

I'm not unhappy seeing other people do these things, in fact the core thrust of what I was saying is that we should work towards a society where all people can pursue the things that make them happy.  

This last bit is possibly where we are at misunderstanding

&gt;Again, you can read and watch Netflix all day during normal times just fine, don't understand why the pandemic makes it easier to do it. The pandemic just removed the option not to.

There is a social pressure placed on introverts to engage in social activities even when they may feel drained, even if they find them enjoyable.  

&gt;\[I\] don't understand why the pandemic makes it easier to do it.

And herein lies the potential misunderstanding, the pandemic made it easier to do this because it simultaneously removed any social stigma around not wanting to go out and even made doing the activity an introvert might prefer (staying in) virtuous, which some introverts relished taking advantage of.  

\---

Overall, I don't hate people, I don't hate social activities, and I'm no hermit, I enjoy taking my dogs for walks, going for hikes, and even getting together with friends.  I also don't hate extroverts or want to see them miserable, **I want everyone to be happy.**

And I don't think anyone is actually in the wrong, when my extroverted friends invite me to go do things it's not a diabolical plan to sap me of all my energy, they just want to have fun and they don't see a need to recharge.  Having the societal expectations of pressure of having to disappoint friends, decline invitations, or in the worst cases being seen as someone that doesn't like fun because they want to stay in and recharge lifted made life a bit easier.  

Do I miss many of the things I could do pre-pandemic, of course.  Do I miss getting together with my friends, yes.  Do I miss seeing people that aren't my dogs or wife, absolutely.  Do I miss feeling bad that I'd rather not go out again this week even though my friends want me to, not really.  Do I miss mandatory fun social times at the office, no.  Do I miss the commute, the constant stream of people wanting to chat while I'm working, no, but that's also more of a work-from-home vs work-in-office thing which is a little bit sideways from the extrovert / introvert thing.",,,1617642241,{},gth0qe5,False,t3_mkbp7c,False,True,t1_gtgx0e5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mkbp7c/cdc_suicides_decreased_in_2020/gth0qe5/,1617643212,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_4lx15,False,False,,

This is the opposite of fear-mongering, friend. 

&gt; With nearly a third of the country having already received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and more than 2 million vaccinations occurring every day, the cloud of anxiety that has plagued the nation for the past year is finally beginning to lift. The end of the pandemic is in sight. Attaining herd immunity—the point at which transmission stops because the virus doesn’t have enough susceptible hosts to infect—now feels like a real possibility. But there’s a catch: The children must be vaccinated.

&gt; “We’ll never get to that population level of herd immunity until we vaccinate kids,” says Jennifer Nayak, division chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. **She was also “incredibly excited” by the Pfizer/BioNTech results.**

...

&gt; “The fact that children are mounting a robust response to the vaccine is very positive and really bodes well that hopefully we’ll see the same thing as we move into the lower age groups in testing vaccines,” Nayak says.

&gt; With kids making up about 22 percent of the population in the United States, their immunity is crucial to reaching a national threshold of immunity, which experts estimate to range from 70 up to 90 percent, explains Tara C. Smith, an epidemiologist at Kent State University in Ohio.

&gt; **Even if the U.S. reached that range without children, the disease would continue spreading because it’s herd immunity at the local, not national, level that matters, says Dominique Heinke, a postdoctoral researcher and epidemiologist in North Carolina. Even in a highly vaccinated population, unvaccinated people clustering together and interacting allows the virus to continue circulating, especially if they congregate indoors without masks and social distancing.**

&gt; “That’s exactly what we see with kids’ social structures,” Heinke says. “Even if you’re at ‘herd immunity’ levels for adults, if the kids aren’t immune, either through natural immunity or through vaccination, then those chains of transmission aren’t getting broken and you’ve got a whole group of susceptible individuals where the virus can continue to transmit.”

...

&gt; An estimated 3.4 million infections have occurred in children, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, accounting for more than 13 percent of all U.S. cases. Children’s risk of death from COVID-19 is extraordinarily low—under 0.03 percent—and the most common complication, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children is also rare, with just over 2,600 cases and 33 deaths through the end of February. But those numbers will increase as children make up an increasing proportion of infections.",,,1617642134,{},gth0hv0,False,t3_mknsuj,False,True,t1_gtgw3ej,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mknsuj/what_we_know_so_far_about_the_effort_to_vaccinate/gth0hv0/,1617643091,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_9nj96ndu,False,False,,

[],,Dakke97,,,,,,[],"Full text: The Navajo Nation, which once had one of the worst coronavirus case [rates](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/18/us/navajo-nation-infection-rate-trnd/index.html) in the United States, recently reached an extraordinary milestone: [zero cases](https://www.navajo-nsn.gov/News%20Releases/OPVP/2021/Mar/FOR%20IMMEDIATE%20RELEASE%20-%200%20new%20cases%20and%20no%20recent%20deaths%20related%20to%20COVID-19%20as%20Navajo%20Area%20IHS%20reports%20over%20191000%20vaccine%20doses%20administered.pdf) and zero deaths in a 24-hour period.

The nation, which has over 300,000 enrolled members, is averaging about 11 new cases a day, far below its peak of 250 in late November, according to [the latest data](https://www.ndoh.navajo-nsn.gov/COVID-19/Data) from the Navajo Department of Health.

And it has vaccinated more of its population than any state, with more than half of its 170,000 residents living on tribal lands fully vaccinated.

But there are some alarming signs. With [infections rising again nationally](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/28/world/covid-cases-surge-variants-restrictions.html) and dangerous [variants](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/health/coronavirus-variants-vaccines.html) circulating, U.S. health officials are warning of another surge. And the first confirmed case of the more contagious and possibly more lethal [variant first found in Britain](https://www.navajo-nsn.gov/News%20Releases/OPVP/2021/Mar/FOR%20IMMEDIATE%20RELEASE%20-%20First%20case%20of%20COVID-19%20UK%20variant%20confirmed%20on%20the%20Navajo%20Nation_HAN_UKvar.pdf) has been confirmed on Navajo territory, which stretches across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.

The Navajo, the second-largest U.S. tribe, aren’t alone in their struggle against the virus. Indigenous Americans have had Covid-19 death [rates](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6949a3.htm) nearly twice those of white populations in the United States, amid high rates of comorbidities like diabetes and obesity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Jonathan Nez, the president of the Navajo Nation, said the tribe was able to tame the virus because members had followed strict lockdown orders and a mask [mandate](https://www.navajo-nsn.gov/News%20Releases/NNDOH/2020/Apr/NDOH%20Public%20Health%20Emergency%20Order%202020-007%20Dikos%20Ntsaaigii-19.pdf), which was imposed nearly a year ago.

“It wasn’t about restricting people’s freedoms when we told people to wear a mask or to stay home. It was looking at the greater good,” Mr. Nez said on the CBS program “Face the Nation” on Sunday.

Vaccination efforts have also been a big success, Mr. Nez said, with about [218,190 shots](https://www.ndoh.navajo-nsn.gov/COVID-19/COVID-19-Vaccine) administered (nearly 90 percent of the doses allocated) and 88,513 people fully vaccinated.

“I think just because of how hard hit the Navajo Nation was, we’ve seen a big increase in participation in taking the vaccine,” Mr. Nez said, adding that officials have been holding town hall meetings to build trust and answer questions about the virus.

Tribal health officials have also credited the nation’s decision to coordinate closely between the federal Indian Health Service, which oversees care for the more than 500 tribes throughout the country, and [Navajo health organizations](https://navajotimes.com/reznews/navajo-leads-the-country-in-vaccine-rollout-heres-what-went-right/), a much more streamlined operation than the patchwork approach across the country.

Other tribes have also had successful pandemic responses. Reported cases in the Cherokee Nation, the largest U.S. tribe, [dropped sharply](https://public.tableau.com/profile/cherokee.nation#!/vizhome/CherokeeNationCOVID-19Dashboard/CNHSDashboard) in mid-March, when Oklahoma stopped reporting daily virus data. The tribe also quickly administered [thousands of vaccine shots](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/us/vaccines-covid-cherokee-native-americans.html) but is now facing the problem of getting hesitant people vaccinated.

In the pandemic’s early days, the Navajo Nation [struggled to contain the virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/us/coronavirus-navajo-nation.html). Mr. Nez attributed the difficulties to resource inequities, an underfunded health care system and limited federal help.

The Indian Health Service “has been underfunded since its inception,” he said. A New York Times investigation last year found that the agency struggled to respond to the pandemic because it has long been [plagued by shortages](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/us/politics/coronavirus-indian-health-service.html) of funding, supplies and health care workers.

A more recent [NPR analysis](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/19/969046248/why-native-americans-are-getting-the-covid-19-vaccines-faster), however, found that tribes that decided to receive vaccines through the Indian Health Service — including the White Mountain Apache of Arizona and the Rosebud Sioux of South Dakota — were far ahead of those that went through state systems.

[Tribal elders’ deaths](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/us/tribal-elders-native-americans-coronavirus.html) have devastated their communities. The lack of local data has further complicated the challenge of controlling outbreaks.

President Biden’s $1.9 trillion [pandemic relief package](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/us/politics/tribal-communities-stimulus-coronavirus.html), which he signed last month, provides $31 billion for tribal nations and Indigenous people to address persistent problems like poor health care.

And Mr. Biden appointed former Representative Deb Haaland of New Mexico as secretary of the interior, making her the first Native American to lead a cabinet agency and responsible for the well-being of the nation’s 1.9 million Native people.

“We finally have a seat at the table in getting our information and our advocacy addressed,” Mr. Nez said, referring to collaboration with the White House and the acting director of the Indian Health Service. “With the funds that are coming to the citizens of this country in terms of recovery and rescue, this time around it’s finally helping our nation grow.”",,,1617630121,{},gtgazom,False,t3_mkbm9p,False,True,t3_mkbm9p,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mkbm9p/with_lockdowns_masks_and_vaccines_the/gtgazom/,1617630132,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_16a0fd,False,False,,
