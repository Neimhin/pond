But! It may not be that simple. I just did a little poking around out of curiosity, and it looks like the current COVID vaccination rates across states actually more or less track the flu vaccination rates in the years leading up to the pandemic, with several states (including states that are having surges, like Texas and Florida actually being much *more* vaccinated against COVID than against flu in a typical season.

He announced his Covid-19 diagnosis on July 11 and pledged to return to his show within a day or two.  
  
“Unfortunately for the haters out there, it looks like I’m going to make it,” he wrote. “Interesting experience. I’ll have to fill you in when I come back on the air. I’m hoping that will be tomorrow, but I may take a day off just as a precaution.”  
  
Less than two weeks later, his radio station, 99.7 WTN, announced that the Nashville host was hospitalized “in very serious condition, suffering from Covid pneumonia.” The statement said Mr. Valentine had had a change of heart and urged others to get a vaccine.  
  
“Phil would like for his listeners to know that while he has never been an ‘anti-vaxer’ he regrets not being more vehemently ‘pro-vaccine,’ and looks forward to being able to more vigorously advocate that position as soon as he is back on the air, which we all hope will be soon,” the station said.

I did put this argument to her today, that the vaccine is the most beneficial, least harmful treatment they have to offer for Covid, which is why it's being pushed. Her response: 

""I don't really care who gets vaccinated. I do have a level of distrust because there are effective methods for covid that are not widespread knowledge across the board, why is that after over a year? I do have mistrust because they are focused on methods to try to extinct instead of treat, when long term immunity isn't possible, I have distrust when they use force. 
But at the end of the day, this is what it comes to in my mind. We are talking about a disease I have less than 1% chance of having major issues with, versus a brand new type of vaccination that has an unknown % of long term effects. I cannot possibly make a science based decision right now."" 

I am going to reply tomorrow something along the lines of - treatment methods of Covid would likely be expected to be disbursed by doctors treating individual people with covid. *(She has mentioned things like not taking cough medicine, and changing your position every two hours to avoid lung build up. I have no idea if these are medical recommendations or facebook recommendations)* I have already gone over, multiple times, the differences in risk between actual covid versus the vaccine side effects. I sent the statistics regarding hospitalization rates, she is mid thirties so her hospitalization risk is certainly not less than 1%. You'd better believe if she had to be hospitalized she'd want the newest, most current treatments. She has said she wants a five year study of the vaccine's long term effects. The good news is, she doesn't have to make a science based decision, she's not a scientist. It's not her job to determine what the effective medical or scientific actions are. Which I've already reminded her of. We do not know more than medical professionals, and nearly every medical professional on the globe knowing anything about infectious disease would advise you to get this vaccine. The science has been done for you. 

Sigh. SHe and her husband have both had cancer at young ages. They are alive due to some of the best medical care available on earth. They were happy to follow every recommendation made by doctors with those health issues. There's something different about vaccines, and I just don't know why that is. The antivax component of my family is decades old and heavily ingrained. I argue so pointlessly with this relative, because she is connected to my parents, who are in their 60's and not only unvaccinated, but do not wear masks. It is hard for me to even talk to them right now, because I am so frustrated they are politicizing health decisions that could get them killed or suffering long term health effects. They will not even discuss the vaccine with me. She will engage so I engage with her, hoping to make some small dent in their anti vax identity collective. 

The big revelation for me is her statement ""We are talking about a disease I have less than 1% chance of having major issues with..."" key word here is *I*. Like you said, they see no social collective. They can only see this in terms of their own personal decision.

But, to comment on the matter, I am actually fairly impressed with the masking. They actually actively enforce it and I think at least most people wear it properly. I've only seen one mesh mask so far. Now, there are some people who take it off and a good number who stick their nose out, but I've also seen them getting yelled at whenever a staff member sees it. Most people take it off when outside, but a good few keep it on even then. Seems better than they enforced it at my high school in NC iirc at least. 

As for distancing, while I don't think it's required, classrooms aren't crazy tight at least. Not distanced (at least not when full as you don't have the space), but not packed like sardines thankfully. The nice thing is that dorms are suite style so you get a bit more space there too. 

Now, it's not like covid won't spread at all and isn't something I'm concerned about, but I'm hoping it won't be too bad. Better than a lot of places I've seen. They're also giving free vaccines to everyone (even non students). They have also had classes recorded, so if (realistically when) we need to lock down, there are plans to keep it from being *too* chaotic. It'll still be frustrating, but hopefully not too bad. 

Basically while they aren't doing all the precautions, they are doing some good things like doing a fairly good job of enforcing masks.

[],,helembad,,,[],,,,text,t2_s0xb5,False,False,[],"NEW ZEALAND CONCEDED its ambitious “Covid zero” elimination strategy may no longer be viable today as an outbreak of the virulent Delta variant spread further.

Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins reported a further 21 cases in a virus cluster that emerged in Auckland last week, ending a six-month run of no local cases and sparking a national lockdown.

Hipkins said Delta’s highly transmissible nature was making this outbreak more difficult to contain than others, raising “big questions” about the elimination strategy.

“The scale of infectiousness and the speed at which the virus has spread is something that, despite all the best preparations in the world, has put our system under strain,” he told TVNZ.

New Zealand’s widely praised Covid-19 response – which has resulted in just 26 deaths in a population of five million – centres on eliminating the virus from the community.

It has relied on strict border controls backed by hard lockdowns when any cases do slip through, but Hipkins said Delta may force a rethink.

“(Delta’s) like nothing we’ve dealt with before in this pandemic,” he said. It does change everything, it means that all of our existing preparations begin to look less adequate and raises some pretty big questions about the future of our long-term plans.""

Neighbouring Australia has also pursued a “Covid zero” strategy and been similarly frustrated as its Delta cases continue to spike.

The New Zealand outbreak has underlined the country’s slow vaccination rollout and prompted accusations the government became lax after its early success dealing with the pandemic.

Only about 20% of the population is fully inoculated, one of the lowest rates in the developed world.

Opposition National Party spokesman Chris Bishop said the outbreak had exposed a lack of urgency in Wellington’s vaccine plans.

“The government’s complacency and inability to ensure supply and delivery of the vaccine has made us all sitting ducks, completely vulnerable to the Delta variant when it inevitably got into the community,” he said.

Another opposition figure, ACT Party leader David Seymour, said Hipkins could not use the Delta variant as an excuse for current failures.

Starts with the Israeli government figure that 60% of Covid hospitalisations in Israel are vaccinated people. Sounds bad. Until the Simpson Paradox is factored in. 

The essence is that in Israel, 90.4% of over 50's have been vaccinated. So while it looks like more vaccinated people are in hospital (60% of Covid hospitalisations are vaccinated people) in reality 90% of people have received the vaccine in the over 50's. So it is skewing the data. 

A simpler breakdown for the Simpson Paradox I have seen is:

Take 100 people

90 are vaccinated 10 are not vaccinated.

Say 15 of the vaccinated people and 8 of the non-vaccinated people end up in hospital with covid. 

More vaccinated people ended up in hospital. But that is just because 90 people out of the 100 guys were vaccinated to begin with so the pool of people is larger.

Later, more data showed that [spreading your second vaccination apart even further than 3 weeks](https://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oxijyr/increasing_the_time_gap_between_covid19_vaccine/) like they did in Israel and the US causes a much stronger antibody response. The UK (and Canada) spread their vaccination doses out from the start, so it's fair to say their trials are going to show a stronger vaccine effectiveness by at least some points than here in the US.  
And, more data shows that over time antibodies from the vaccine do wane, and this study was from over 2 months ago, antibodies have waned at least some since.  
And finally let's just throw in the fact that not everyone vaccinated has 2-doses of Pfizer or Moderna. About 1/5 of ""vaccinated"" Americans are only 1-dose, which is almost garbage against Delta at 33% effectiveness. And some are only J&amp;J which is also not as effective against Delta by a mile.

They secrete compounds that help modulate your immune system as they don't want to be attacked and eradicated.  It is postulated that due to this symbiosis, their abrupt absence in people in developed nations has helped fuel auto-immune epidemics.  Since they dampened parts of the immune system, their absence can push some people to have uncontrolled immune responses.

When they deworm people in developing nations the notice their auto-immune conditions increase.  

There's been studies that show people with celiac and crohns disease may benefit from hosting certain worms.  

Some people with covid die from cytokine storm (basically your immune system going apeshit and damaging organs).  

So certain worms could actually be beneficial to at least some people against covid.

Yes. 

Because actually looking them, comprehending them, would lead to the absolutely inescapable conclusion that we have to lock down again. Because of Delta, it's even more necessary now than it was back in March of 2020. But you know, as long as you don't look directly at a thing, you can pretend it doesn't exist. 

Even most of those who are willing to acknowledge that the numbers are as bad as they are start going on about how ""the public has no appetite for another lockdown"" as if that makes the slightest bit of difference in terms of what must be done. 

And yet, it seems that we are simply not going to do it. The only explanation for this is that at some level, perhaps even only unconsciously, there has been a collective decision made that we're just going to absorb the continuous, and continuously escalating, losses, the deaths, the disability brought on by long COVID, the collapse of our healthcare system's ability to reliably provide care, whether one is sick with COVID or something else. 

Some of us, of course, will make it to the other side relatively unscathed, but at this point I could not even hazard a guess as to what society will look like by then.

If the amount is low enough, your compliment system can deal with it before you notice anything (which is how most pathogens entering your body every day are dealt with).

Which Chinese people?

&gt; Which is why many of them are starting to reconsider the covid zero strategy

There are 1.4 billion people in China. I obviously haven't asked all of them what their opinions are, but the overwhelming impression that I get is that there is very strong, broad support for the zero-CoVID strategy.

There's one well known doctor, Zhang Wenhong, who wrote an essay vaguely implying that China should move away from its zero-CoVID strategy. There was a huge, negative reaction from the public to his essay, and he then wrote an update saying that he still thought zero CoVID was the best strategy for China at the moment. There are clearly some people who are toying with the idea of letting the virus spread in the country, but it's a very unpopular suggestion (rightly so, in my opinion).

&gt; It's not only about border controls (which are having very significant impacts btw), but general insecurity about when the next outbreak will hit and how long and widespread the lockdowns will need to be.

Lockdowns have been very limited since mid-2020 - far more limited than in most of the developed world. The control strategy has shifted towards mass testing and contact tracing, with only localized lockdowns of specific areas where there are particularly high numbers of cases (in the Chinese context, this might mean a dozen cases a day in a city of a few million people). Just over the last month, China succeeded in ending its most serious outbreak since the original one in Wuhan, and only a few cities ended up being locked down - a tiny fraction of the country.",,,,1629642123,{},h9wu9w4,False,t3_p85x1l,False,True,t1_h9w4t6b,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p85x1l/analysis_china_insists_its_zerocovid_strategy_is/h9wu9w4/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,f189641a24a9b16f00a0d3680a749fa8117d2064,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1629642138.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Sure, which can then be further reduced by masking and social distancing. Furthermore, more data is still needed to determine if boosters are necessary. From what I've read from Pfizer, data seems to suggest that a third booster shot can boost vaccine efficacy against Delta and other variants up to the high 80s-low 90s. See [this](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-submission-initial-data-us-fda) press release.

&gt;The booster dose elicited significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers against the initial SARS-CoV-2 virus (wild type), and the Beta and Delta variants, compared to the levels observed after the two-dose primary series

&gt;After the booster dose, neutralizing titers for variants were similar to wild type

&gt; “The data we’ve seen to date suggest a third dose of our vaccine elicits antibody levels that significantly exceed those seen after the two-dose primary schedule. We are pleased to submit these data to the FDA as we continue working together to address the evolving challenges of this pandemic.”

&gt;They are not buying into this idea that it helps them stay out of the hospital. Not in the way this is being communicated.

This might vary by locale, of course, but here in the States, people aren't buying the self-preservation or socially conscious arguments either. Hospitals in the South are getting flooded with patients, the overwhelming majority of which are unvaccinated, so clearly neither ""get the vaccine to protect yourself"" nor ""get the vaccine so you don't overwhelm the hospital systems"" are working.

Incorrect (barring a few weird edge cases). Arriving ship crews have to quarantine, being at sea and out of contact with any other person counts as quarantining but they still have to get tested and isolate on arrival if there are any potential issues.

&gt; Key elements of the Maritime Border Order
&gt; 
&gt; Bans foreign ships from arriving in New Zealand, with a range of exceptions, including:
&gt; fishing ships and cargo ships
&gt; those that have been granted permission if there is a humanitarian reason or a compelling need for the ship to be delivered to a NZ business.
&gt; 
&gt; Requires the **testing, isolation and quarantine of arriving crew**. 

&gt; Requires the majority of arrivals by sea to isolate or quarantine on board their ship or at a MIQF for at least 14 days since the last port of call or since it last took crew, and requires every person on board the ship to meet the low-risk indicators (including a negative COVID-19 test) before any person may enter the New Zealand community.

&gt; If persons arriving by sea cannot appropriately isolate or quarantine on board their ship, they will be transferred to a MIQ facility.

But for mono, almost every adult has had it at some point, and people rarely get it twice. It's also not as contagious as the cold or COVID.

[There was a measles epidemic](https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/graph-us-measles-cases) before the measles vaccine was invented. The modern MMR vaccine is very effective and appears to protects people for a long time.

[Almost every US adult had chicken pox at some point before the chicken pox vaccine was made. ](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html). [The chicken pox vaccine appears to have long lasting effectiveness, making a booster unnecessary.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/varicella/hcp/about-vaccine.html)

So the reason why there is no measles or chicken pox pandemic is because of long lasting and effective vaccines. Examples of diseases that requires regular boosters are the flu and tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (TDAP). Adults are recommended to get TDAP boosters every 10 years.

You might be wondering why there's talk about COVID 19 boosters so soon. There's actually some controversy over whether they're even necessary.  [Some scientists disagree with Biden's decision to roll out boosters right now, saying there's not enough evidence to support the need for them.](https://www.statnews.com/2021/08/18/u-s-decision-on-covid-19-booster-shots-baffles-and-upsets-some-scientists/). Are they right? Who knows. The covid vaccine is so new that it's hard to study its long term effectiveness.

The bottom line is, COVID is a new and rapidly changing disease. It's only existed for about 1 and a half years. There's still a lot we don't know about it, unlike the diseases you listed. So if booster shots later become necessary, it's not some conspiracy or because scientists just like fucking with people. It's because they've done carefully controlled studies which resulted in data strongly suggesting that the vaccine loses effectiveness over time.",,,,1629659965,{},h9xzaow,False,t3_p97wn3,False,False,t1_h9xq50m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p97wn3/daily_discussion_thread_august_22_2021/h9xzaow/,1629723226.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

If workers are performing their duties efficiently while not having someone standing over them why do companies need to pay the people standing over the workers?  If everyone working from home is more productive without managerial interruptions and issues then really a company just needs someone to ensure the jobs are being done and employees are kept in the loop with any issues, updates, or training requirements.  That can be done by far fewer people than are currently in place as middle management.

I had a manager who would read everyone's emails, browse their computer data, and then spend an hour every evening before we were leaving detailing why we were all lazy and not doing enough for the company.  When she went on vacation all of our goals were met more quickly and efficiently and we had time to fix some issues she had created.  The higher ups loved that change.  When she came back the productivity level plummeted again.  She got rid of the improvements that let us work better and then put reprimand in our files for ""slacking off"" while she was away.

One of my coworkers took the documentation of what had been done while she was away to HR and the VP of the company.  She got moved to a different department at a different branch (I assume they plummeted as well) and we got a manager who let us do our kojob.  First day he was there we all started filing into the conference room ou of habit.  When told why he came in and said simply, ""look you all are adults.  You know what you are supposed to be doing.  You don't need me to hold your hands.  If you have a problem my door is open.  Otherwise I'd like each of you to teach me what you do so I can help support you better.  Over the next few weeks we'll set up time for me to spend with all of you, but for now go home and have a great evening.  See you tomorrow"".  And so we left about an hour early that day feeling like we had gotten away with something.  He was a good boss and worth keeping as a manager.  He would have been able to run a few departments like ours honestly.  She wasn't capable of running 1.  I'm sure she is somewhere out there complaining about how bad it would be to let employees stay home.  She had no point in her role other than to berate everyone who worked for her.

Mask filtration efficacies:

TLDR;

When tightly-fitting, most masks filter more than 90% of particles that are larger than 300 nanometers in diameter, and quite a few filter more than 80% of particles that are smaller.

For **particles over 300 nanometers, 99.9% get blocked by N95, and 99.6% get blocked by a surgical mask** (assuming perfect fits). Standardish, 600 threads-per-inch cotton mask block 98.4%.

&amp;#x200B;

Droplet/Aerosol size:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7579175/figure/ijerph-17-06960-f001/?report=objectonly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7579175/figure/ijerph-17-06960-f001/?report=objectonly)

TLDR;

A single coronavirus is about 90 nanometers in diameter.(we don't sneeze, cough, or exhale dry, perfectly separated viruses)

Generally, exhaled or coughed or sneezed viral particles are suspended in liquids from our bodies; mostly, these **droplets range in size from 400 nanometers to 42,000 nanometers**.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Combined TLDR;

Most masks that are worn correctly will keep 90% or more of viral particles out (or in, as the case may be).

When both parties are masked, even just 90% efficacy becomes 99%...

90% of exhaled particles get blocked on the way out, leaving 10% in the air; briefly.

90% of that 10% would be blocked, allowing only 1% of an exhale in.

[],,TheSaxonPlan,,,[],,,,text,t2_9hnec7bv,False,False,[],"There are other genes of the virus which could be targeted by the vaccine, but there's a good reason why the spike protein is the main choice: until the virus infects your cells, the only viral protein ""seen"" by the immune system is the spike protein. 

Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses, which means they use the lipid bilayer of your own cells as their outer coating, with just the spike proteins poking through. They do this to hide from the immune system since it's harder for antibodies or immune cells to find the spike proteins among the thousands of other proteins that are normally on your cell surface. There are other types of viruses that have no lipid coating (such as adenoviruses) so this strategy is not universal among viruses.

The reason for targeting spike protein with the vaccines is to make antibodies against spike and train immune cells to recognize the spike of a viral particle in your lungs or blood floating around and trying to infect your cells. Stopping the virus before it can get inside a cell is by far the most effective way to stop the virus entirely. 

Now, if the virus does get in and starts undergoing its replication cycle, those other genes will be transcribed and other proteins produced. However, they will be kept almost entirely within the cell, so there isn't a chance for the adaptive immune system (mostly T and B cells) to see them and react. 

There is a process by which cells can chop up proteins and present the bits to immune cells to check for weird things happening inside the cell like infection (called the MHC complex). However, most viruses have a way to shut this down as another sneaking method. I'm not sure if SARS-CoV-2 has such a mechanism but I wouldn't be surprised if it does. 

Bottom line, yes, having more antibodies against different viral targets is useful, but if you're at the point of depending on non-spike antibodies, it's already too late.

It's kind of true that actively choose to go out in public but the part where I ""expose people to my non-vaccinated self"" is not an actual deliberate action, it's simply a byproduct of the absence of having committed a prior action. It makes as much sense as saying ""you chose to go out in public and expose people to your un-pierced ears"". The latter part of the statement doesn't really apply; I simply chose to go out in public while not having gotten my ears pierced. Again, there's a conceivably infinite number of states that I'm not in when I choose to leave the house, I don't need an excuse for every one of them.

Furthermore, ""going out in public"" is kind of a bogus designation as well. If I'm alive, I have to exist *somewhere* at any given time, and being in the presence of other people is just as arbitrary a place of existence as staying locked up inside of my home. Actually, some people physically don't have a home in which to be at all and can *only* exist ""out in public""; they don't ""go"" there so much as they simply exist there. In this sense, *not* being in public is both a man-made contrivance and a luxury; you're treating the absence of this like some kind of calculated invasion when it's actually one's natural state as a human animal. In that sense, other people are choosing to be where I am just as much as I'm choosing to be where they are. Being in separate spaces from each other works both ways.

So yeah, not comparable to getting drunk and piloting a machine.

&gt;Let me change the example if that’s too hard for you; going out nude in public should be fine as well

The UK study I linked above did make an attempt to distinguish symptoms that interfere with daily life vs a scratchy throat for two weeks: ""When considering only debilitating symptoms, estimates at 12 weeks post infection ranged from
1.2% of 20 year old cases to 4.8% of 60 year old cases (CONVALESCENCE [4]) [High Confidence].""

And agreed, those numbers have been seen in other viruses as well with similar rates. The issue is the current rate of transmission of things like the Delta variant on a naive population. In a normal year, I have a 10% chance of catching the regular flu, without any mitigations. However, with Delta, if there were no restrictions nor vaccines, I'm guessing my chances of infection rise to close to 100%, no? So comparing the long-term sequalae of covid to other viral infections isn't fair IMO, until my chances of yearly infection drop to flu-like levels.

Also, it's unclear to me if the dehabilitating symptoms of long covid happen from a more dangerous underlying mechanism involving microclotting and coagulation in general: https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/p7ei9h/blood_clotting_may_be_the_root_cause_of_long_covid/ If this is different than the flu, EBV, etc., I think it shouldn't be lumped in with these other viruses.",,,,1629601798,{},h9v7vhq,False,t3_p92tgm,False,False,t1_h9v6m7v,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p92tgm/the_vaccinated_are_worried_and_scientists_dont/h9v7vhq/,1629672059.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

A good scientist isn't biased and doesn't hold data on a high pedestal just because of its results. I think you're thinking of a politician or someone else with an agenda...

A study is a study -- assuming it was conducted in good faith with good methodology, being ""trustworthy"" isn't relevant. You're thinking politics again. I'm simply saying, as a scientist, this study doesn't generalize well to the current situation of Delta in the US for non-full-PPE wearing randos on the street. The numbers speak exactly for what they say: the risk of breakthrough infection in a high-PPE population with a vaccine with 95% efficacy against the Alpha strain prevalent at the time. That cannot be applied directly to a different population (who doesn't wear PPE like that) with a different efficacy for a different strain with a different prevalence at the time...

Right, no peer reviewed evidence for anything to do with long covid and vaccines yet -- wasn't this study accepted to the NEJM? Anyway, we have people over and over again in this thread and elsewhere repeating that the chance of long covid with the vaccine is negligible. In the rare case where they even attempt to support that statement, they mistakenly cite this study as ""proof."" That reflects a misunderstanding of science and how these results do or do not generalize outside what was presented in the paper.

**""A review of nasal sprays and gargles with antiviral properties suggests that a number of commonly used antiseptics including povidone-iodine""**

**""the use of nasal and oral antisepsis has the potential to be useful for combating SARS-CoV-2.""**  

**""In addition, hypertonic saline targets viral replication by increasing hypochlorous acid inside the cell.""**

A review of nasal sprays and gargles with antiviral properties suggests that a number of commonly used antiseptics including povidone-iodine, Listerine®, iota-carrageenan and chlorhexidine should be studied in clinical trials to mitigate both the progression and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Several of these antiseptics have demonstrated the ability to cut the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 by 3–4 log10 in 15–30 s in vitro. In addition, hypertonic saline targets viral replication by increasing hypochlorous acid inside the cell. A number of clinical trials are in process to study these interventions both for prevention of transmission, prophylaxis after exposure, and to diminish progression by reduction of viral load in the early stages of infection.


Conclusion
While nasal sprays and gargles cannot replace the use of traditional personal protective equipment (i.e., gowns, masks, protective eyewear and gloves), **the use of nasal and oral antisepsis has the potential to be useful for combating SARS-CoV-2.** Clinical trials currently underway will be the best mechanism to determine the true benefit of these compounds and their role in mitigating disease progress and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Is two months enough to reformulate the mRNA vaccine, produce, and distribute it domestically, even in a scenario where it can be treated just like the flu vaccine each year that operates on new strains (i.e. skip clinical trials)? I don't know, but I am going to guess that's perhaps not going to be realistic, ever? Hopefully I am wrong about that.

It's been suggested that SARS2 is experiencing convergent evolution, so I am hopeful that given how well the Wuhan-strain vaccine works against Delta still, a Delta-strain vaccine might work even better against future Greek letters of the alphabet, as long as we find a way to keep antibody titers up. The latter may not be practical/feasible, but investigating nasal-spray style vaccines that protect via the mucousa may be where we end up in the future (people are working on this).

I agree.  I'm vaccinated and so are most people I know.  I know SIX people who've already been vaccinated for at least a few months with Pfizer (same flavor I got) who all contracted COVID in the last month and a half...but *probably* not the Delta variant.

Here is my point, though:  The local health authorities (this is in Oregon) did not press for those SIX people to get tested, they told them to assume they had COVID and quarantine for 11 days or whatever.  Three of them insisted on getting tested and all came back positive.  Those 3 ""count"".  **The other three don't show up anywhere, numbers-wise, because they never got tested.**

I spoke with Contact Tracing because one of the infected had given my name as a potential-exposure.  After hearing that I was vaccinated, the person on the other end of the line kind of blew off the idea of me getting a test if I got symptoms (which I never did) but I pressed and they eventually said if I contacted them directly after getting symptoms, they'd arrange one for me.

FWIW.  IMO, there's some bullshit going on out there and it seems like the State might want to keep fully vaccinated but-later-infected folks ""off the books"" as much as possible.

If 90 percent of the population is vaccinated most cases will be from the vaccinated population as almost everyone is vaccinated as opposed to unvaccinated. It’s the actual case numbers that matter not percentages. However since you like percentages I’ll give you the following example. 

You have a total of 1000 people in your own little country. We will call it idiotville. 

900 are vaccinated 100 are unvaccinated.

Over the course of one month there are 50 infections resulting in hospitalization. 

Of those 50 infections, 30 are vaccinated breakthroughs and 20 are unvaccinated.

Percentage wise that translates to: 

20 percent of the unvaccinated population were hospitalized

3 percent of the vaccinated population were hospitalized

In the example above more vaccinated people  end up in the hospital than unvaccinated but it’s meaningless considering how few people are unvaccinated.

So it does look grim...the vaccines don't even seem to last 6 months. 

Official data also says the vaccine is good for about 5 months:

Breakthrough COVID-19 more likely months after vaccination

**People who received their second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine five or more months ago are more likely to test positive for COVID-19** than people who were fully vaccinated less than five months ago, new data suggest. Researchers studied nearly 34,000 fully vaccinated adults in Israel who were tested to see if they had a breakthrough case of COVID-19. Overall, 1.8% tested positive. **At all ages, the odds of testing positive were higher when the last vaccine dose was received at least 146 days earlier**, the research team reported Thursday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. Among patients older than 60, the odds of a positive test were almost three times higher when at least 146 days had passed since the second dose. Most of the new infections were observed recently, said coauthor Dr. Eugene Merzon of Leumit Health Services in Israel. ""Very few patients had required hospitalization, and it is too early to assess the severity of these new infections in terms of hospital admission, need for mechanical ventilation or mortality,"" he added.

That's the line of reasoning we need to be approaching. The ""hur dur horse medicine"" approach only strengthens people's belief that The Science is hiding the truth.  The Science lost a lot of credibility with the Anti Vax crowd when it said not to wear masks (March 2020), COVID isnt airborn and only spreads through droplets (March 2020 - May 2021), COVID vaccines stop people from catching and spreading COVID (December 2020 - August 2021).  I've been defending Science throughout the pandemic because Science is a learning process, not a one-time answer.  It's very hard to stay credible with the anti-vaxers, so I have to focus only on the logic behind what is happening. There is a lightbulb moment when they realize where their reasoning is flawed.

Beyond that, there's not much one can do but hope.  It's possible to be optimistic or pessimistic about this.  In the beginning, there was the suggestion that masks only protected others, not the wearer. That turns out not to be true.

The focus is mostly on UK and US and any countries that are in particularly bad shape or trending badly at the moment, and I don't think I've seen Japan mentioned very often specifically, but you can still find value in the studies.

Like this one from a few days ago about Vaccine effectiveness in UK:
https://youtu.be/qsq9C-p7rwU

And in this one he goes over the Israel data about waning protection over time:

https://youtu.be/rAqVAiPXbJc

Generally from what I've seen from him is that the studies from Israel suggest that levels of protection from infection for Delta is a bit less than from Alpha (original) but still pretty high, however over time that percent drops and you become less protected from infection, especially after 6 months (which is part of why you're seeing some lower numbers, because we now have people who have been vaccinated for over 6 months). However, even if you do get infected, the protection against hospitalization and death is still very high, even after six months.

And even if it's high protection from infection, it's not 100%. The more you put yourself in risky situations the more likely you are to get the infection. But it's still high enough that you should be able to mostly resume regular activities with confidence, just maybe wear a mask on those crowded trains still to give yourself just a little bit of added protection and/or reduce transmission to others if you do end up with it.",,,,1629637430,{},h9wl6i2,False,t3_p92tgm,False,True,t1_h9vqpku,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p92tgm/the_vaccinated_are_worried_and_scientists_dont/h9wl6i2/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,c94e8f4108c33482cd702f6e5b8cd1eafd12f334,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1629637444.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Your argument is terribly flawed and based on outdated information.  We need to be better at advocating for the vaccine if we are going to convince people to vaccinate.  

It's not 15 minutes.  It's one dose, with a 2-3 week pause, and then a second dose with another 2-week pause. It's at least a month before full vaccination.  You are also ignoring the 1-3 days of temporary side effects where some vaccine recipients are mostly staying in bed. It's better to compare this downtime to the moderate COVID cases, where people have something worse than the flu but are not hospitalized for up to two weeks. 

It's not totally free. You're paying for it through insurance and taxes. If your insurance paid for the vaccine, you will also be paying taxes to cover shots for the uninsured and the people who lied about their identity to get their third shot.  It's better to compare the indirect cost of the shot to the direct cost of the hospital stay and over the counter medicines for treating the extreme flu-like symptoms of a moderate case.  

It's not equivalent to compare the vaccine to something that prevents heart attacks.  The vaccine largely prevents hospitalization from COVID, but vaccinated people catch and spread COVID.  Your example should be a vaccine that prevents hospitalization from heart attacks, but acknowledges that the heart attacks still happen.  

Thank you for hearing me out on this.  The low hanging fruit of unvaccinated people were convinced by your original statement, but we need to use a different technique for the next round.

At the beginning of the pandemic I felt scared for myself and my family, but also extremely sad for those who caught it...especially those who died, and for their families.

Now, I feel sad for their families. I know I shouldn't feel this way but I have withdrawn my sympathy for the antivaxxers and antimaskers. Think about this: someone, let's call them Person A, inadvertently passed Delta to many others, one of which may have been someone's child, one child who got really sick and died.

Let me reemphasize this: one child, at least ONE child, MAY have died because of Person A's selfish anti-vax / anti-mask decision. So how and why can I use some of my dwindling amount of compassion toward Person A? 

I'm not.

I'm holding onto it and giving it out to their families, their kids, and those who got sick for no reason of their own.

Is the main purpose of these vaccines to lessen the chance and severity of COVID-19?  

This is done my creating antibodies.  They can be naturally occurring by getting COVID and recovering. They can also be from a vaccine. There is disagreement over which antibodies are more effective. 

Now does it make sense that getting a vaccine first helps protect from severe COVID complications and so if and when you do get COVID and recover you’ll then have the benefit of having both vaccine and recovery COVID antibodies? 

Why isn’t the benefit of being protected from the first severe bout of COVID sickness being promoted so that when this seemingly unstoppable disease does enter your body and you recover you’ll be doubly protected?  

I hope antibody levels of “breakthrough” sicknesses after recovery are being monitored so this seemingly important info will be known and therefore the debate over which antibodies are best can be re-focused into which course of action makes COVID 19 less dangerous.

[],,newkiwiguy,,,[],,,,text,t2_y78jf,False,False,[],"My understanding is the presymptomatic spread is not any longer with Delta than previous strains.  It just happens much faster after infection, giving contact tracers much less time to find and isolate a case before they become infectious.  In earlier strains it was a median of 6 days to symptoms and there fore 4-5 days before they were infectious.  Delta it is median 3.7 days to symptoms and therefore only 1-2 days after exposure before infectious.  

The shorter incubation period creates a very steep exponential curve, but at the same time it means an outbreak appears much faster.  People are less likely to be incubating it without us knowing now.  Since we have been in lockdown for over 4 days now, it is likely anyone infected before the lockdown will be known by now. 

&gt;A Guardian article from someone living in NZ just recounted how everyone is so used to a normal daily routine that even hours before the lockdown, the run on stores occurred maskless.

It did, because we have never worn masks in NZ.  We got our first ever mask mandate on the second day of this lockdown.  But since it was introduced I have seen 100% compliance everywhere.  Since we have never had them, they've also never been politicised here. 

&gt;I was going with the comment from the OP that asymptomatic people are not tested (perhaps this is not true, as you mention mass testing)

We ask anyone who is a close contact to be tested regardless of symptoms.  They must isolate, including from household members, stay inside completely, check in regularly with healthline and get tests immediately and at days 5 and 12 after exposure.  Close contacts include every student and staff member and parent of any school that had a single case.  Anyone who was in a mall where a single case visited with a one hour window.  As a result 72 cases have produced around 10,000 close contacts.  On top of that all contacts of close contacts must also self-isolate and get a test if they have any symptoms.  

All locations that positive cases visited are listed, push notifications sent to the app we are now required to use to scan into any public place (it also has bluetooth) and they even comb through CCTV footage to identify any links between cases.  

I am American too, though I've lived in NZ for over 15 years.  Kiwis are much more rule following and accepting of authority than Americans.  People actually drive the speed limit.

However I'm not sure this fact has much bearing on the point I was making, which was that prior covid infection has a different ***relative*** effect on vaxxed vs unvaxxed populations.  Since efficacy is itself an assessment of relative effect (how fewer cases happen with the vaccine vs without), this difference in relative effect of prior covid or not skews the efficacy calculation in an uncontrolled way.

Thinking about it further, I guess your point could be seen as confirming mine.  To wit (all numbers guesstimates): unvaccinated covid naive people have approx 0% protection, while unvaccinated people who've had covid have 80% protection. So a relative +80% protection in the unvaccinated population for having had covid.  Vaccinated covid naive people have some high level of protection, lets say 90%.  We don't know how protected vaccinated people are if they've also had covid, but logically protection can't go above 100%.  So the relative protection in the vaccinated population for having had covid can't be more +10%.  Therefore, the relative benefit from having had covid is not the same between the vaxxed and unvaxxed groups, and this skews the efficacy calculation.

That web server runs a similar application that then converts the XML into SQL statements and pushes them into the database.

The entire thing was incredibly buggy. It runs as a Windows service, and if the service is running and you launch a second window while the service is already running, the new Window ""takes over"" and all the data already in queue to be converted or uploaded is lost.

I think many managers are probably astounded when they find out that workers value their personal lives more than the company. And frankly, if management is this naive to think otherwise, I'm almost wondering where are they finding these people. 

Someone is going to jump ship if they are given better hours, more money, more freedom. If you're the company that seems to feel like the only way you're going to keep an employee is by forcing them into a cubicle farm or an open plan hell, breaking their spirit in the pre-pandemic corporate life, then be prepared to lose a lot more people. That, or pray for another big economic downturn where everybody ends up desperate for income and thus are willing to take the abuse.

The reality is that COVID is gradually becoming an endemic illness and that means that cases may come and cases may go at different points in time.

Jesse Jackson, 79, is vaccinated against the virus and received his first dose in January during a publicized event as he urged others to receive the inoculation as soon as possible. He and his wife, 77, are being treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago.  
“Doctors are currently monitoring the condition of both,” according to the statement from Jesse Jackson’s nonprofit, the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.  
“There are no further updates at this time,” the statement said. “We will provide updates as they become available.”  
A protégé of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jesse Jackson was key in guiding the modern civil rights movement on numerous issues, including voting rights.

Let's look at the blue lines, which are fully vaxxed people, and stick to the left most graph (all ages) for simplicity.

For the top three items, Hospitalization, &gt;5 reported symptoms, and symptoms lasting &gt; 28 days, the closer the blue line is to 0, the better. If the vaccine had no effect at all, the odds ratio for each of those metrics would be 1 (the green vertical line), meaning you have the same odds of hospitalization regardless if you were vaxxed or not. So, if we look at the blue lines for these three metrics, we can see that the vaccines reduces the odds of these bad outcomes. We can also see it is much better at reducing chance of hospitalization than reducing the chances of symptoms.

For the last metrics, chances of asymptomatic infection, the further away from 0, the better. This is showing that the blue line (vaccinated) is twice as likely to have an asymptomatic case than an unvaxxed.

Not enough people were vaccinated with the mix-and-match for it to significantly affect the rates - it might make a 5% difference, but even that seems very unlikely.

Nearly all of us waited 4 months between doses, however, and IIRC there were some studies done that indicated this resulted in better overall protection down the line.

ETA: While catching covid presents risks like long covid, organ damage, and the like, and we don't know how well the vaccines protect against that, we are seeing that vaccinated people are ~1/100 as likely to wind up in the hospital if they catch covid, and ~1/1000 as likely to wind up in the ICU.

So there's good reason to hope that the vaccines will be similarly helpful against long covid and organ damage as well, and if so, the main concern with the low efficacy is that it's not high enough to arrest the spread of covid, but you yourself have good odds of coming through the infection without much ado.",,,,1629604612,{},h9vd68d,False,t3_p92tgm,False,False,t1_h9vcakd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p92tgm/the_vaccinated_are_worried_and_scientists_dont/h9vd68d/,1629674888.0,25,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The world needs a proper investigation into how covid-19 started

China, though, is not keen

Aug 21st 2021

“THE VIRUS MYSTERY”, broadcast on August 12th, drew uncommonly wide attention for a Danish television documentary. That was because it featured Peter Ben Embarek, an expert on food security and zoonotic diseases, casting doubt on the conclusions of a “joint study” on the origins of the covid-19 pandemic carried out earlier this year under the auspices of the World Health Organisation (WHO). Dr Ben Embarek was the senior WHO figure who went to China as part of that study.

In March the joint study reported that it was “extremely unlikely” that the virus had been released in a laboratory accident. Dr Ben Embarek revealed that this conclusion did not come from a balanced assessment of all the relevant evidence but from a steadfast refusal by the Chinese members of the joint study to support anything stronger. Indeed they only allowed even that minimal assessment on the condition that the report did not call for further investigation into the question. He also pointed out that the idea that the point of spillover was someone collecting bat samples for research purposes belongs in the “likely” basket, along with other human interactions with wild bats.

Problems in the joint study had long been clear. Within the WHO one source describes it as “riddled with compromises and sloppiness”. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director-general, was uneasy about the way it was carried out. He pushed back at the marginalisation of the lab-leak hypothesis, particularly when the final report was released in March. He has since called for further investigations into it, as well as into other possibilities.

The further unravelling of the joint study matters because, more than a year and a half after the covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan, a city in Hubei, was first recognised as the work of a new pathogen, there has been nothing like a thorough international investigation of how that pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, got into humans and spread round the world. The pandemic’s death toll stands at 9m-18m, according to a model which The Economist has built on the basis of excess-mortality reports and other indicators. The question of how it started matters both for the relatives of the dead and for those who wish to prevent such an outbreak happening again. China’s efforts to stop the world from answering it are both shabby and, to an extent, self-defeating. The more the truth seems hidden, the more it seems suspicious.

Earnest calls for an international investigation into the origins of covid-19 began in April 2020, voiced most clearly by Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia. The next month the World Health Assembly, the gathering of government representatives which serves as the WHO’s decision-making body, passed a motion calling for a study into the origins of the pandemic. But in order to be acceptable to China—which had reacted furiously to Mr Morrison’s original suggestion—the work was set up as a joint research project between two teams of scientists, one Chinese, one international. And it was to be based on “scientific and collaborative field missions”, rather than a targeted and forensic inquiry into all the relevant circumstances.

The terms of reference, which were subsequently negotiated behind closed doors, allowed the Chinese hosts to frame the joint study’s work in the way which best suited them. The study was set up to build on pre-existing Chinese research, not to delve into unvetted data. Investigating the laboratories that had been working with coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan was not part of its terms of reference.

After a lot of wrangling, the international team got to China in January this year. Data about the first reported covid-19 cases, those from December 2019, were one subject of friction with their hosts. The Chinese had reported 174 such cases, but would not share the underlying data on which those reports were based. Hearing that these vital data were not being made available worried Dr Tedros enough that he lobbied the Chinese government for access. The authorities declined, citing concerns over citizens’ privacy. It could have been anonymised.

Elsewhere the team appears to have been knowingly misled. Take, for example, the live-animal trade at the Huanan seafood and wildlife market, a site associated with a number of Wuhan’s earliest recorded cases of covid-19. In its final report, the study group took at face value claims there was no credible evidence that live mammals were sold there in 2019. A lot of eyewitness accounts gainsay that; so does a study published in Scientific Reports, a journal, this summer.

One report and no more

The Scientific Reports paper found that 18 species of mammal had been for sale in Wuhan between May 2017 and November 2019; gunshot wounds and trapping injuries suggested that almost a third of them were taken from the wild. Although the paper was published only recently, it was submitted to the journal in October 2020. Chinese law requires that all covid-19 research be reviewed by the government before it is sent to a journal. Some Chinese authorities would have known of its contents before the team arrived.

The market is not the only way for animals and the pathogens they carry to get into Wuhan. The horseshoe bats in which the closest wild relatives to SARS-CoV-2 have been found do not live anywhere near the city, but the two laboratories there that were known to have engaged in coronavirus research received samples from bat caves around the country. The joint-study team was not allowed to investigate the procedures around, or documentation of, this research; when it visited the laboratories the team was shown presentations on safety procedures but no more.


When the researchers left Wuhan the WHO’s Geneva headquarters told them that their report needed to be laid out scientifically and could express dissenting opinions; the international members and the Chinese members did not have to reach a consensus. However, according to sources within the WHO, the team felt committed to producing a joint report with their Chinese counterparts. Dr Tedros was so unhappy with what finally emerged from the processes that he nobbled the report as it left the starting blocks, rejecting its contention that the possibility of a lab leak needed no further investigation.

On May 26th President Joe Biden ordered America’s intelligence services to report on the pandemic’s origins in 90 days (time will be up on August 24th). When he and his fellow G7 leaders met in June they joined in calling for a timely, transparent and science-based follow-up study. On July 16th Dr Tedros laid out the next steps which the WHO wants to see taken. They include further work on the Wuhan animal markets, studies of early cases and audits of local laboratories.

The Chinese government has reacted angrily to the idea of further studies on its territory. Zeng Yixin, the vice-minister of China’s National Health Commission, said he was “shocked” by the plan to investigate a lab leak, saying it was “impossible” to accept. According to the Global Times, a tub-thumping tabloid run by the Communist Party, 55 countries have sent written complaints about the proposal for further investigations to the WHO. Dr Tedros, elected director-general with China’s support in 2017 and derided by President Donald Trump as China’s puppet, may now face a Chinese-backed candidate when he looks for reappointment later this year.

In the absence of any hope that China will co-operate, sources of data beyond its control have become increasingly important. One area of interest is genetic sequence data. Another is early cases exported from China.

See what you did there

An online open-source-intelligence group which calls itself DRASTIC has been scouring sequencing data to get insight into activities at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). When researchers publish sequences they typically post the raw data from which those sequences are assembled to public databases such as the sequence-read archive at America’s National Centre for Biotechnology Information. Contamination events in the laboratory, or within sequencing machines themselves, mean these data sometimes contain sequences not meant to be there. In theory such evidence could reveal nefarious goings-on.",,,,1629603588,{},h9vbaef,False,t3_p9538l,False,True,t1_h9v9u8h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p9538l/the_world_needs_a_proper_investigation_into_how/h9vbaef/,1629673859.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

He had to learn to walk again and dealt with some paralysis all his life.  He’s elderly now and has post polio syndrome along with peripheral neuropathy.  He’s in constant pain and he’s always tired.

Scientists and doctors don’t know the long-term effects because the virus is novel.  It hasn’t been around long enough for longitudinal studies across decades.  When I was a kid, I caught chicken pox because it was expected to be a regular childhood illness - mild in the scheme of things.  I remember hating it.  Everything itched.  I, like many in my generation, have a pock mark as a reminder.  The connection between chicken pox and shingles was made in the 1950s…but kids my neighborhood were still sent to chickenpox parties to “get it over with.”

Long story short:  I don’t want to expose my kids to a virus that we know so little about - not if I can help it.  I’m also still waiting for the approval to vaccinate the younger ones so they have some level of protection.

I’m just glad I can read these comments in Reddit.  It’s helpful.  This pandemic has been isolating and sometimes I feel like I’m crazy.  There are so many hostile anti-mask/anti-vaxx people in my area.  It’s alarming.

**Findings:** People who had recovered from COVID-19, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits versus controls when controlling for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group, pre-existing medical disorders, tiredness, depression and anxiety. The deficits were of substantial effect size for people who had been hospitalized (N = 192), but also for non-hospitalized cases who had biological confirmation of COVID-19 infection (N = 326). Analyzing markers of premorbid intelligence did not support these differences being present prior to infection.

But as for me, I'd really like to see data that better establishes there's substantial risks long-COVID in vaccinated people before making substantial changes to my lifestyle.

Thus far, the risks seem too...speculative? We really have hardly any studies on it; the one I know of (the Israeli health care study) only had a sample of only 39 breakthrough cases; and studies of long-COVID in general seem to use an incredibly broad array of symptoms to identify it (some serious, some not).

That said, Anosmia is not unique to Covid, it's always been around. It certainly seems like it's more frequent with Covid and in unvaccinated it certainly is, but I've been unable to find any stats for vaccinated Anosmia percentages, and the length of time that it lasts. 

Right now every story about Covid symptoms is amplified in a way these things never were previously. It's always been difficult, prior to Covid (2017) the NIH estimated that between 3-20% of the population has suffered from it. 

It's really tough, but the percentage chance has never been 0, so you always have had to make a risk assessment with the information you have.

If you're a physician with access to uptodate, look up the covid-19: diagnosis page to confirm what I said, here is a snippet on serologic testing:

&gt;Serology to identify prior/late infection — Serologic tests detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the blood, and those that have been adequately validated can help identify patients who previously had SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as patients with current infection who have had symptoms for three to four weeks (table 3). Because serologic tests are less likely to be reactive in the first several days to weeks of infection, they have very limited utility for diagnosis in the acute setting [34,89,90]. Checking serology three to four weeks after the onset of symptoms optimizes the accuracy of testing, since test sensitivity beyond five weeks is uncertain [28].",,,,1629583242,{},h9u6bsv,False,t3_p8mvo0,False,True,t1_h9u5kdl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p8mvo0/daily_discussion_thread_august_21_2021/h9u6bsv/,1629650958.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,harbison215,,,[],,,,text,t2_a0vo0,False,False,[],"There’s also a complexity of defining “works” when trying to figure out if masks “work.”

For example, my anecdotal experience:  my girlfriend works in a bar, in December she came down with a vicious case of Covid.  Hospitalized for 10 days, double pneumonia etc.

Anyway,  in her bar at the time, nobody is as actually wearing masks.  No one.  Once we realized she had a fever, I put the mask on in my house and kept it on.  I even drove to get her tested and waited in the car with her hacking her lungs up for 2 hours.  

Anyway, I did end up getting infected, but I had an extremely mild case.  I lost some sense of taste and smell and that’s as far as my symptoms went.  Maybe the mask had nothing to do with it, but I’m fairly certain that even know the masks didn’t keep me from becoming infected, I personally believe the masks reduced my exposure enough that my case was generally mild.

Now I’m not telling anyone to take my word for it as some medical proof.  My point is, although the masks may not prevent infection, it’s very possible that they can minimize the severity.

[],,slappymcnutface,,,[],,,,text,t2_3fxp3,False,False,[],"People are really misunderstanding the situation here. The vaccine's effectiveness **mostly** comes from avoiding transmission. However, if you are a breakthrough case, your chances of dying are reduced by ~2/3 or even ~half. Even among vaccinated people this variant is certainly more harmful than the seasonal flu. 
  
But the most important thing is that Delta seems to be able to permeate through even fully vaccinated populations. Of course the spread among vaccinated populations isn't half as steep as the huge **spike** we've seen lately among the unvaccinated - the vaccine does surely *slow* transmission - but the slope is still in an upward direction. This means the virus is not only *not going away*, it's *getting worse*. It's not an imminent threat like all the other suges we've experienced so far, but it is a looming problem for which we seem to have no pharmaceutical solution.  
  
Fortunately because the slope is so shallow, we should be able to push the rate of transmission &lt;1 with some generic social distancing like mandatory masking and indoor capacity restrictions or whatever. But people are not going to like this, and I personally don't have confidence there will be sufficient compliance among the population. 
   
----- 
 
 The key takeaway here is that just because you are vaccinated, doesn't mean you'll never take a whiff of Delta. Yeah the curve is shallow now so it may not get you today or even in a few months. But this thing now has endurance since we've shot nearly all our pharmaceutical ammo (in the medium-term anyway), and it will likely blow past your face in the foreseeable future. And from the data we have, you're only ~&gt;half as likely to avoid death or long-haul once you do contract it.

They are keeping troops healthy in clinics and hospitals around the world, fighting covid in their own hospitals, serving on their own deployments.

Mind you bases have shut down most of the recreational activities that cause spread, the military has to get vaccinated, and masks are required throughout military installations because the DoD knows just how little healthcare it has and military bases are largely in areas that currently have high community spread (the base hospitals also see a great deal of family members and retirees, so that community spread is a double whammy).

As I pointed out elsewhere in this thread, computing an efficacy rate in the general population using breakthrough cases vs cases in unvaxxed people is confounded by the fact that we don't know how many people in both groups have had covid before. If you consider the possible effect that previous covid infection has on the efficacy computation, you see that the error introduced likely makes efficacy appear worse than it actually is.

Right now, its just not practical to assess (in a statistically rigorous way) who in each group has been previously infected.  And as we see in this thread, people are very quick to try and estimate efficacy without realizing this complication. (No aspersions intended towards other posters; its a complicated subject).

So I theorize that the CDC realized that this information (breakthrough case rates) wasn't meaningful without the missing information of prior infection rates, and that it could very easily be misused (intentionally or otherwise) to paint vaccines in a negative light.

My point being is that while vaccinated individuals who are infected are just as contagious as unvaccinated individuals who are infected, to say that the vaccine does nothing to prevent the spread of illness is still wrong. The vaccine can outright stop infection, thereby preventing spread entirely in the first place. Delta is more likely to cause breakthrough cases than ancestral COVID or other variants, but it is still being curbed by vaccination. 

The best message to put out isn't ""get the vaccine to just keep yourself out of the hospital because you're guaranteed to get COVID no matter what.""

If our immune systems have a more complete profile of coronavirus, my guess would be on average the immune response would be swift and severity would be lower due to viral load not being able to establish hold in vital organs.  Since vaccinations provide a better profile out of the gate, this is likely why previously infected are encouraged to still get vaccinated.

In that regard, I don’t think that my assumptions are too hyperbolic in nature because of what the current research is showing for post COVID damage. While I hate the sensational newsreels and shit, I’m also worried that we are focusing on some of the wrong stats. COVID has demonstrated itself to be quite insidious. The death toll may not be enough to “scare” people into believing it’s serious. But there are very real long term issues that we can see emerging, that will have a considerable effect on people’s quality of life. If we can already see how these things are effecting adults, and we have no good reason to assume that it won’t have the same effect in kids, I would feel better about taking something too seriously than kicking back with a laissez-faire approach.

[],,zelticgar,,,[],,,,text,t2_129sl7,False,False,[],"There is a shift in this mask discussion that has resulted in people starting to sanctifying masks. I think one reason for this is the small but vocal people who are anti-mask. They have given people an oppressor to focus on and the mask discussion has become something akin to a moral (or religious) identity.   One of the resulting issues that is starting to emerge is with this is we have lost the ability to assess risk and the discussion around children getting sick with Covid is no longer about managing the inevitable of them getting sick but has moved onto this unrealistic idea of no child should ever be exposed to Covid. It has become the orthodoxy of progressive parents.  The long term impact of this on parents and more importantly children is to be determined but i predict there will be many scenarios in this coming school year where parents will find conflict over the risks their children will need to face related to Covid. My fear is that these people who are sanctifying masks and thinking they can live in a world of zero tolerance are going to be much more disruptive than what we are currently seeing with anti-vaxxers going to school committee meetings. Imagine a kid testing positive and a parent tracking it back to a teacher who may have been seen outside without a mask, or imagine a child testing positive and they perceive it was due to another childs family not being safe - like going to a sports tournament. You'll see parents demanding the schools to take action against those children and parents. There will be an insistence that they need to be kept safe at all times.  Eventually the demands for safety will turn to anyone who is perceived to threaten their children through not adhering to their orthodoxy around masks and covid safety demands punishment.

Interesting -- I had heard they chose the 3-4 week window just to get quicker results. Oh, you mean why make it two doses instead of one, where that dose would mature over time? Yes, you're right, that's probably why they chose the two doses.

I'm unable to view the graph, but are you asking about antibody waning being exponential decay? Oh, you mean why have a second dose so quickly when antibodies don't wane quickly enough between doses to justify it? I believe the answer is that antibodies are just one part of the immune system, while another goal of the vaccine is to build long-lasting durable immune memory (T cells, etc): this can better be accomplished with two doses, rather than one, due to how the immune system works.

As far as covid goes... I think they are getting it right. Are people testing positive on board? Sure. But it's at a much lower rate than in their respective communities. From what I have seen they have a pretty solid plan in place if you do test positive. Quarantine areas are in a separate section with it's own ventilation system. They have extensive contact tracing on board once someone tests positive. The Carnival Vista made news a couple of weeks ago for 27 positives (26 crew &amp; 1 passenger.) They did over *900* teats once they had the first positives. Honestly, I wish my community took it as seriously as the cruise industry does. They have plans in place to debark a sick passenger if their needs are greater than the ship medical center can supply (at additional cost or travel insurance.)

I'm not saying there is no risk. There certainly is. And it should not be entered into lightly. I have given so much thought to all the ""what if's"" and basically have a game plan already thought out for foreseeable scenarios. If someone has done their personal risk assessment, thought through what could go wrong &amp; and decided to sail...wish them a good trip.

&gt; The state of São Paulo recorded, this Saturday (21), occupancy of 40.3% in ICU beds for Covid. According to the State Secretariat of Health, for the first time since April 2020, no municipality had ICU for Covid filled in the state.

&gt; The occupancy of ICUs for Covid has been falling in São Paulo since June, when, on the 1st of that month, it was 81.3%.

&gt; On August 1, ICU occupancy was below 50% for the first time since November last year, when, on the 24th, it was 49.4%. From that moment on, a growth in occupation began, reaching over 92% in April this year.


&gt; The secretariat also points out that, at the moment, there are 7,495 people hospitalized with Covid, of which 3,842 in ICU and 3,653 in wards. The figures once reached more than 31 thousand hospitalized patients.

&gt; With the improvement of indices in recent months, restrictive measures to prevent further circulation of Sars-CoV-2 have been relaxed. The governor João Doria (PSDB) even reduced the Covid Contingency Center, composed of specialists.

&gt; Bars, restaurants, businesses and services can now serve with 100% of capacity and without a time limit for operation. In addition, Doria announced that the São Paulo F1 stage, in November, will be held with the Interlagos circuit full.

&gt; The broad relaxation comes at a time when the delta variant is showing signs of advancing in Brazil, particularly in Rio de Janeiro so far. The strain is more transmissible and has vaccine escape, which has caused significant increases in cases in other countries. Israel, for example, where the percentage of the population with a complete vaccination schedule is higher than in Sao Paulo, had to resume restrictive measures to prevent an even greater advance of the delta.

&gt; Meanwhile, in Rio de Janeiro, cases and hospitalizations have increased.

&gt; Specialists have shown concern with the flexibilization in São Paulo and warned that the situation is cautious, exactly because of the community transmission in Brazil of the delta variant.",,,,1629596353,{},h9ux0bo,True,t3_p93khb,False,False,t3_p93khb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p93khb/brazilian_state_são_paulo_has_40_icus_capacity/h9ux0bo/,1629666047.0,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

It doesn't totally wear off (at least not yet, and I think the consensus is that it's unlikely to do so in the future) - even if you were the very first person to get the vaccine, you're a lot more protected today than an unvaccinated person.

Yes this is a big issue. The efficacy of the vaccines against delta has been oversold for to long. Not only in the media but also in comments and upvotes on social media. Only now this is slowly starting to turn around (mostly because the reality that people see around them can no longer be ignored) while the first signals of reduced efficacy against delta , coming from the delta wave in India , are months old.

Its a complicated issue and lots of important data is still missing. Delta consists of several sub variants and the efficacy of the vaccines also depends on which sub variant is going around in a certain area. 

The pandemic is a marathon and maintaining public trust for the long run is more important then trying to convice a small amount of aditional people to now take a vaccine which in the end is not as effective as promised. 

Most people who have trust in science would take the vaccine anyway regardless if it was highly effective or a bit less effective. This is the vast majority of people and maintaining the trust of this part of the population is the important thing. Overselling the efficacy risks undermining this trust. 

People who dont trust in science will not take the vaccine regardless of what is promised,they will now (wrongly,as a vaccine is still far better then no vaccine) feel they where right all along and people who had doubts but where convinced will have doubts again and will be more difficult to convince in the next round. 

A vaccine is still far better then no vaccine also against delta but the efficacy is not high enough to end all the problems coming from the pandemic. 

Staying optimistic is obviously very important but stability is also very more important. Reality sets certain bounderies to optimism.

[],,Ema_non,,,[],,,,text,t2_194s0r,False,False,[],"&gt;A confidential report into Russia’s Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine prepared by its developers to support its authorization around the world, has “severe inconsistencies” and differs from data previously published by Russia on Sputnik V’s clinical trials, a group of independent experts told The Moscow Times.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The report does not question the overall safety or efficacy of the vaccine. But the inconsistencies come at a time of renewed scrutiny into Sputnik V clinical trials, as Russia seeks to secure emergency authorization from the WHO and EMA, and its export drive falters amid multiple reports of production delays and late deliveries.  
Scientists who reviewed the document found a number of discrepancies between the information it contains and what has previously been disclosed by Sputnik V’s developers, including in a landmark Feb. 2 peer-reviewed report in leading medical journal The Lancet, which found the vaccine to have 91.6% efficacy.  
Flaws in the newly-obtained report range from apparent typos and basic numerical errors — such as mislabelled statistics and table headings — to more serious concerns, including unexplained changes in the number of patients in the study.  
“Some of this is probably accidental — things which aren’t very severe but are just poor reporting,” said André Gillibert, a biostatistician at university hospital CHU Rouen in France.  
**“But there are also irregularities and problems that are too severe to be explained away. I think there were problems with the trial that are being hidden,” he added.**  
His concerns were shared by other scientists who reviewed the report, including Vasiliy Vlassov, an epidemiologist at Moscow’s Higher School of Economics and biologist Konstantin Andreev at Northwestern University. Both have previously highlighted flaws in the reported results of Sputnik V’s clinical trials, and said the new document adds more areas of concern.  
**“Overall, there are lots of flaws, discrepancies and numerical errors in the report body,” said Andreev. “It is difficult to say whether these indicate a careless proof check or actual data ‘smoothing.’”**   
  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Despite the independent scientists being able to track and spot such inconsistencies in the new report — which formed the basis of Russia’s submissions to regulatory bodies around the world for the vaccine’s approval at the start of 2021 — some believe the developers have tried to downplay or “hide” possible weaknesses in the study.  
“Such reports are usually prepared with a thorough hiding of any problems — and without fear of diligent reading,” said HSE’s Vlassov. “It’s intended for an external reader and everything that can be hidden is being hidden.”  
“There may have been problems in the conduct of the trial, but it’s very hard to know exactly what was wrong,” said Gillibert. “I can see the inconsistencies, but I cannot explain them.”",,,,1629652736,{},h9xikbc,True,t3_p9gehn,False,False,t3_p9gehn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p9gehn/leaked_sputnik_v_report_shows_more/h9xikbc/,1629714415.0,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike influenza, coronaviruses have a good error correction. When copies are made, there are fewer mistakes in the proteins. Influenza changes like crazy. Most changes don’t benefit either virus and they are all just completely random. Natural selection decides which mistake is beneficial. 

So, the hope is that sars-cov2 is more like most other viruses that have been controlled with vaccination. They likely mutate until they reach peak fitness. Measles being the top of what has been seen for transmissibility.  Then they stabilize which allows vaccination to eradicate them. 

Here is a nice read talking about that idea.

My traveling party and I are all fully vaccinated and are willing to get a booster shot if they are approved and necessary. We will also be wearing masks and social distancing as much as possible if we see that COVID spread is not minimal. However we will be visiting higher-risk tourist places like New York, Philadelphia, Washington DC, Boston, and Orlando for Disney World Resort.

I have a few questions:

- Do you think it is safe to start planning and booking the trip yet? I don’t want to sink time, money, and excitement into planning something and have it go down the drain like our 2020 travel plans due to COVID. If I plan and book, I better be 95% sure it’s actually going to happen, I hate getting super excited for a trip and put time into planning it and be let down by COVID, or anything really.
- Do you all think we will even enjoy our trip? I mean we are pretty comfortable going out to local places right now (with vaccine, distancing, masking when not eating/drinking, dining outdoors, sanitation, etc.) We are pretty comfortable going to theme parks, stores, malls, restaurants, arcades, outdoor sports games, movie theaters, etc. in the local area, but I want to know if COVID restrictions in summer 2022 will make it hard to enjoy the trip (haven’t traveled since summer 2019 so don’t really have experience with that).
- Will Florida be THAT bad in summer 2022? The Disney World part of the trip will be the highlight of it for us, as we have never been there. Being a huge Disney Parks fan (been to Disneyland in CA dozens of times), this is the one part I am really looking forward to, more than anything else, so I am very concerned about it not being safe/being guilt-tripped by Reddit into not going to a “COVID breeding ground” and missing out on the one place I have been intensely wanting to go to for over 2 years now. Will the case counts be as bad as now, or you think they will calm down by then?

We conducted a test-negative case-­control study to explore the vaccine efficacy (VE) in real-world settings. We recruited participants aged 18-59 years who consisted of SARS-CoV-2 test-positive cases (n=74) and test-negative controls (n=292) during the outbreak of the Delta variant in May 2021 in Guangzhou city, China. Vaccination status was compared to estimate the VE of SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccines. A single dose of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine yielded the VE of only 13.8%. After adjusting for age and sex, the overall VE for two-dose vaccination was 59.0% (95% confidence interval: 16.0% to 81.6%) against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 70.2% (95% confidence interval: 29.6% to 89.3%) against moderate COVID-19 and 100% against severe COVID-19 which might overestimate due to the small sample size. The VE of two-dose vaccination against COVID-19 reached 72.5% among participants aged 40-59 years, and was higher in females than in males against COVID-19 and moderate diseases. While single dose vaccination was not sufficiently protective, the two-dose dosing scheme of the inactivated vaccines was effective against the Delta variant infection in real-world settings, with the estimated efficacy exceeding the World Health Organization minimal threshold of 50%.

After managing onsite teams for about 15 before that.  It is, IMHO, night and day more difficult to manage the remote team. And, IMHO, most of the issues solved by remote work are actually issues with horrible open offices and long commutes- not anything specifically to do with remote vs onsite work.

Some thoughts from doing this for over a decade:

* 25% of people will be productive no matter where they are. 25% will be problematic no matter where they are. 50% of people work better with some form of office infrastructure. Everyone thinks they are in that first 25%

* Dealing with HR issues is much much more problematic with remote employees. Try dealing with terming someone with a substance abuse problem when you never get to see them in person and don't have an attendance record to support your HR case

* People's home environments are often horribly full of distractions. People put up with this during Covid because there were no other alternatives- but having someone's toddler running around screaming during meetings is an issue. A good WFH environment will have a dedicated home office and a good WFH employee will have uninterrupted time in that office- but most don't have their home workspaces set up properly

* People's WFH performance deteriorates over time- especially over many years. Especially with employees with kids who only one parent is WFH. Suddenly you realize that you are working around an employee who has to pick up the kids from school every day during work hours- folks start building lives/schedules around being able to disappear for a couple hours a day.

* There are simply no good current tech substitutes for a classic conference room whiteboard session. Doing this remotely sucks.

All of that can be managed with appropriate focus/tools/etc. But it adds substantially to the managerial effort required. I think it seemed to work during Covid better than it would have because many tech firms paused or slowed down their project work during that period. (I know all of my clients basically shelved most of the project deliverables last/this year and we are just now getting back to regular project planning cycles)

We'll see, maybe I'll be wrong and the tech has progressed to the point where this will work. I think the norm is going to become hybrid plans where folks are in the office a couple days a week but can't fully live anywhere they want",,,,1629646193,{'gid_2': 2},h9x38c3,False,t3_p9dd93,False,False,t3_p9dd93,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p9dd93/remote_work_may_now_last_for_two_years_worrying/h9x38c3/,1629706810.0,34,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,2,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

You were the one that went to a shitty open office plan that forced everyone to wear noise canceling headphones to concentrate.

I've been with my current employer 18 years and I'll be talking to recruiters the day I hear we might be going back.

As if most managers can tell what software people (at least) are doing by actually seeing them.  You could run a Matrix screensaver and some would think you are being super-productive.   I think a lot of this is that they like to have their manager meetings with other depts and show off their fiefdoms.

Driving into an office in order to sit crammed in tiny stalls with headphones on, remoting to servers nowhere physically close to you--that make sense to anyone?  


If actually walking behind people is your way to know they are productive--I'd say it's time to work on your business processes and get better at project management.

It's to the benefit of everyone. When you work for a business, you're technically a part of a team or organization or some group with a collective goal. Meeting in-person, sociologically speaking, has huge benefits to these goals. You could've done college projects via email, but you still met up in the student union. The local book club could organize entirely through Facebook, but they go to the library. It's less moving parts, more interactive, and will always work in real time, but most importantly those interpersonal interactions themselves are very important for the individual as well. That's why in-office *should* be expected outside of certain careers. 

Only certain people thrive in WFH environments, but those same people would thrive in an office environment as well, and it's far more efficient to have everyone on the same platform.

What you will probably see in the future is a mixed model.

Baseline background: immunity (whether via past infection or vax) has never meant that a person is impervious to infection; it has always meant that they're more likely to beat any infection they do get... so don't let infection stats throw you off.

General stats: \~2% of hospitalizations are among the vaxxed, and \~1% of those who die are vaxxed... so you're like 100 times less likely to die even if you get a breakthrough infection.

Behaviorally, nothing has changed: outdoor is safer than in, less exposure time is safer than more, distance is better than close, mask is better than no mask.

&amp;#x200B;

On how breakthrough infections happen: lots and lots of people have stopped acting as though we're in the middle of a pandemic, and most restrictions have been lifted in most places... so there are more chances for spread than there were in pre-vax times.

I'm in a similar range and though I didn't have any reaction, I hope they solve this issue for the next round. From what I understand myocarditis is actually pretty common in athletes, so good shape isn't a deterrent there.

I am male, yes. I didn't know it was that common, I thought there were only a few hundred cases out of the millions of administered doses. Any idea why it is pretty common in athletes?

&gt;Nice! I wish we had the same health system you guys do. I'm on the hook for a few thousand dollars if something like that happens to me (and I have a ""good"" health plan!) but here in the US we have to budget for it happening once every few years.

Our health system has its pros and cons too. I've waited 4+ months just to see a dermatologist as an example. I thankful for not having to pay anything though. I'm a dual citizen of Canada and the US so I know sometimes budgeting for things like that can be stressful (especially if you don't have insurance). 

&gt;They say here that if you had a non-typical reaction to an mRNA vaccine you shouldn't get another dose, but it's up to the doctors to decide whether that's relevant anymore. Sorry you had to go through all this.

It is very clear, and has been for awhile, that many people will no longer mask in any situation (c.f. Florida and Texas), and that others will no longer mask in situations where they do not perceive a believable risk to themselves (outdoors, already vaxxed, around friends, etc.).  Given this, the CDC may have reasonably assessed that taking a hard-line approach to masking for everyone would have little effect, while at the same time losing an opportunity to incentivize vaccine uptake.

With hindsight, one might conclude that this approach didn't goad as much vaccination as the CDC would have liked.  However, despite it being a common narrative, there is no evidence that, by itself, the CDC's messaging regarding masking for unvaxxed people contributed meaningfully to the spread of covid.  Indeed, there are recent studies showing little to no positive effect from mask mandates.

So the CDC's approach might have been ineffectual, and with hindsight may have represented a missed opportunity to take a different approach that we now know would have produced better results.

[],,productivitydev,,,[],,,,text,t2_b7ekyf5f,False,False,[],"And I think there's valid concerns in general to doubt any information received from official sources. Since the beginning of this virus. First official messaging was that the virus is not a big deal even thought seeing how fast it spread, and initial amount of deaths, I don't see how it could've been containable at all. It should've been obvious. Second official message was that masks won't protect against Covid. Okay, maybe there was an underlying reason that they didn't want people to hoard the masks. That's totally understandable, if I was a government I'd probably do the same. But the catch is, whatever information official sources release after that, or censor for that matter, all of it could be ""white lies"" stemming from very, very many different motivations, the white lie may even be that they want purposely sound more confident than they really are to convince masses to go through with the plan. All of this involves politics, money, and so many other motivations at play. It's just impossible for me to tell what information I can trust essentially.

Then some time passed, with masks, officials were confident that they are effective in reducing Covid spread. They maybe, they may not, but I don't think there was any actual clarity in that. Even Redditors themselves were so confident that masks work, they compiled a list of 60+ studies supposed to definitively and once and for all prove to nay sayers that masks are definitely effective. Looking closer, I didn't find a single study that reached this conclusion for covid specifically. Most of the results directed at covid were inconclusive. So at this point in time (there may be now evidence for masks), there didn't seem to be a single legitimate evidence that masks are effective.

All the sites across NY and even the suburbs going out to Albany were completely booked up except for the Bronx. I ended up driving her there so she could get her shot in a reasonable timeframe.

We got there and almost everyone else waiting to get a shot were Manhattanites who had taken the subway up there.

I doubt I'll get very far in the interview, not sure I want to tbh.

But I am looking forward to taking about remote monitoring, virtualisation, fail-over hardware (if not cloud), remote rebooting and the fact that the fastest way for an infrastructure person to get on task is to start from home, no matter how short the commute.

It's a ""family business"" though, so I suspect there's a decent amount of thought that if folks are not in they're not working.

&gt; There are simply no good current tech substitutes for a classic conference room whiteboard session. Doing this remotely sucks

For a little background, I started my first programming job in 1981, so I cut my teeth on the whiteboard meeting. I was a big advocate of the practice, but I think it has been superceded by screen sharing. The use cases for this are varied:

* Share a screen mockup, for discussion
* Share a particularly problematic code segment
* Share an actual software bug by running the software
* Share a Stack Overflow answer you found
* Share a portion of a proposed entity relationship diagram
* Walk through a markup a Word requirements document

etc, etc. It's not just one presenter doing these things, it can be very dynamic and collaborative. Joe can be googling an answer while Ron is roughing out the data model.

Before WFH, my typical whiteboard meeting room had a conference phone, a computer with projection capability, and a whiteboard. The closest you could come to the sort of collaboration of screen sharing would be to bundle up a bunch of artifacts and send them to the meeting room computer. But that is far less fluid and spontaneous. I genuinely don't see how I'd go back.

I'm not discounting your experience of course, but I did want to chime in with a counter-example.

[],,IronDoges,,,[],,,,text,t2_amhzm3h2,False,False,[],"&gt;Canadians died because of the export ban on vaccines we paid for


Canada has no vaccine production capacity which is result of Canadian political choices.  The ""ban"" was a piece of theatre to show the US government was doing something. Manufacturers signed a contract providing the USA with first refusal. Canada signed their contracts knowing full well the entirety of US orders had to be fulfilled before they could export. When contracts where being drawn up the situation was clear, no one was under any allusions what the facts where. The political situation was even clearer with the former presidents America first 24/7 mantra. 


AStrazeneca is an outlier in this situation large amounts of it was exported to the EU for fill and finish. Arguably because the EU was allowing J&amp;j to be exported to the US while production ramped up. Astrazeneca failed to submit an emergency use authorization request in the hope of continuing to export doses to the EU to make up the shortfall. They kept saying ""soon"" so unsurprisingly the USA held onto their supplies to use. It only became clear later that Astrazeneca had no plan to submit the required paperwork when expiration dates neared. 



&gt; go to waste because of their mindless sloth.

Canada was receiving their contracted dosages well before wastage was an issue. 



Finally the United States suffered medication shortages because supplies where redirected to vaccine production. The only way to shield the manufacturers was invoking the defense production act which let them breach other contracts. Here in the UK we signed some brutally selfish vaccine contracts with Astrazeneca. Which resulted in the EU leadership throwing a fit, as AZ production is woefully behind schedule.

My traveling party and I are all fully vaccinated and are willing to get a booster shot if they are approved and necessary. We will also be wearing masks and social distancing as much as possible if we see that COVID spread is not minimal. However we will be visiting higher-risk tourist places like New York, Philadelphia, Washington DC, Boston, and Orlando for Disney World Resort.

I have a few questions:
- Do you think it is safe to start planning and booking the trip yet? I don’t want to sink time, money, and excitement into planning something and have it go down the drain like our 2020 travel plans due to COVID. If I plan and book, I better be 95% sure it’s actually going to happen, I hate getting super excited for a trip and put time into planning it and be let down by COVID, or anything really.
- Do you all think we will even enjoy our trip? I mean we are pretty comfortable going out to local places right now (with vaccine, distancing, masking when not eating/drinking, dining outdoors, sanitation, etc.) We are pretty comfortable going to theme parks, stores, malls, restaurants, arcades, outdoor sports games, movie theaters, etc. in the local area, but I want to know if COVID restrictions in summer 2022 will make it hard to enjoy the trip (haven’t traveled since summer 2019 so don’t really have experience with that).
- Will Florida be THAT bad in summer 2022? The Disney World part of the trip will be the highlight of it for us, as we have never been there. Being a huge Disney Parks fan (been to Disneyland in CA dozens of times), this is the one part I am really looking forward to, more than anything else, so I am very concerned about it not being safe/being guilt-tripped into not going to a COVID breeding ground and missing out on the one thing I really wanted to do.

I do have one more question, hope you could answer it, as it is a point of debate in my community for some time.

With every new variant, we see changes in the spike protein. Over time it changes enough that it starts to circumvent some antibodies produced by the vaccine that targets the protein, leading to decreased effectiveness.

Theoretically, does the decision to use the whole virus in the vaccine help Sinopharm in the fight against variants? As there are other parts of the virus, that get smaller changes while mutating, could that mean that antibodies would have an easier time fighting off different strains?

The reason is pretty simple most people in our team have a spouse and kids and those take time out of work day every single day then since these same people are stuck home over the rest of the time with just their spouse and kids they have no one to talk hobbies with so many team's internal meetings turn into hobby chats at the end.

If you walk across the office and chat for cars for 1-2 hours people will notice, but you can do that easily on a call.

Maybe. You have not showed evidence for this and I doubt it. I doubt it because symptomatic carriers are likely to be at home, sick. Whereas asymptomatic carriers - WHO PRODUCE JUST AS MUCH VIRAL LOAD WHETHER VACCINATED OR NOT - are likely to be outside, going to work. 

The point is the same. The vaccine does not really protect OTHER people. It will not lead to the end of the epidemic on its own; not without masking and eventual herd immunity.

1. Danger to children
2. Resources taken

I mean the fact that we have so many unvaccinated adults in the ICU kinda tells us we don't need another vector, aka children. But to also be fair, the amount of children, percentage-wise is still low. So in regards to resources taken, it's still so low that it's kind of reactionary right now with regards to children in context.

The death rate is low, but I think the more concerning thing is long term effects. Biological and social. Home schooling is already tough on kids and not very viable.

you don't need high antibody titers to protect the body. i think both the medical community and media misunderstand how the immune system works. there isn't like an large amount of antibodies to diseases in general, like i mentioned half life are in days. the immune system is very complex (duh, lol) but like you said antibody is just one but what offers long term protection is memory t and b cells. they act as early warning systems that if they see a foreign body they say, oh, s\*\*t, someone is trying to get in sound the alarm. then the body goes into overdrive and starts to produce antibodies. the virus then has a ""target on its back"" and now the killer cells can attack. like when the soldier paints the target up a laser and the cruise missile gets a lock.",,,,1629648947,{},h9x9n8w,False,t3_p92tgm,False,True,t1_h9x6za3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p92tgm/the_vaccinated_are_worried_and_scientists_dont/h9x9n8w/,1629709940.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Canadian Consensus Criteria is regarded as the best and most accurate criteria worldwide for ME/CFS. You can compare your symptoms against the diagnostic criteria (starting on page 8, IIRC): http://sacfs.asn.au/download/consensus_overview_me_cfs.pdf

I would recommend moving from assumptions and accusations to asking questions.

One great example would have been asking me if I interacted with anyone after travel or events, prior to testing. 

If you had asked that, I'd have been able to tell you that I work from home, do not have children, and have remained in my own home with no guests each time I've traveled until I've received results from my tests.

For example, I attended the Hella Mega tour three days ago in Pittsburgh. My rt-PCR NAAT test is today at 2:20PM, so upon returning home, I've not gone to the grocery store or the bar or my neighbor's small gathering to which I was invited, because I will not receive the results of my drive-through test for a day or two.

I'm sure you realize that a person does not immediately begin spreading the virus directly after exposure, so I've drastically limited any opportunity of contributing to asymptomatic spread by literally encountering zero people during what could be the contagious period.

These tests are free, quick, accurate, and for many people they are very close to home. 

It is very possible to take a little time to mitigate risk to others, and testing is a very large part of that.

There are several papers that showed this in vitro, and in autopsy. There was a concern that the vaccine can therefore induce myocarditis due to the same mechanism as covid induces myocarditis, but of course if you do the math about viral/spike protein load (and studies also show), the vaccine is still going to be less risk of myocarditis than if you get covid.

Yesterday a paper came out suggesting higher rates of myocarditis for Moderna vs Pfizer; the former used three times the dose, so that would support this theory about spike protein irritation? My guess (again, not a cardiologist) is that dosing interval here would only make a difference if we were seeing lots of myocarditis after the second dose, as opposed to the first, due to some cumulative effects of short-term cardiac irritation by the vaccine. I don't think I have seen this, but I could be wrong. Maybe spacing out doses could only help?

A Guardian article from someone living in NZ just recounted how everyone is so used to a normal daily routine that even hours before the lockdown, the run on stores occurred maskless.

So given the longer presymptomatic contagiousness for Delta, it is possible that hundreds are infected at the moment, and won't know for several days.

It doesn't slow the spread of Delta. I doesn't prevent getting the virus. It prevents getting the disease caused by the virus. So why shouldn't we just decide on our own if we, as individuals, want to protect ourselves from the disease?

The answer is that no matter if we think it's a hoax or overblown or a plot to put magnets in our bodies, once an individual get's sick enough, they WILL go to the hospital. And hospitals are a limited resource in our society that needs to be preserved.

So the pattern being described here is people doing unhealthy things that the medical industry doesn't recommend and we prioritize them lower on the list.

It's definitely a good point of question on where we draw the line. I don't have a definitive answer for that. But in regards to food and alcohol, I don't think you can prove it. A patient can lie about both. You can provide proof of vaccination 

In addition, we only have one life. Unhealthy food and alcohol is a vastly important factor in the enjoyment of life. So it's a bit tangled with that. I don't think it's misinformation causing this. For example, I know I should eat more veggies and less red meat, but I'm balancing the tradeoff of longevity and enjoyment. Whereas vaccines are not. In fact public schools mandate vaccines.

How much of the cognitive issues that have come up have been because of severe disease, or mechanical ventilation? What's the rate of cognitive issues associated with mild illness?

Unfortunately it's really hard to say ""yeah we will lock down again"" because at this point, noone wants that, and the lockdowns have had mixed results. The 75-fold reduction in ICU cases when vaccinated is more than enough to satisfy me personally.

A nasal attenuated vaccine is ideal because it would build the type of antibodies associated more often with the respiratory system, providing that shield we need against illness. They're trialing those now and I suspect it'll be a yearly vaccine for forever. The only issue is whether a live attenuated vaccine will have the same issue as CHADOX where there was thromboses created by the vaccine interacting with the body. Noone will accept a vaccine with a 1/100000 blood clot rate.

But COVID is going to be here forever. Most mammals have ACE2 spike-attachment sites so there will always be an animal reservoir (they found antibodies in white tailed deer, a species whose only interaction with humans is getting shot). The only hope is it doesnt mutate in the animals to be far deadlier, like SARS Classic with its 10% CFR.

[],,orangeoliviero,,,[],,,,text,t2_hrgdk,False,False,[],"&gt; Long covid is mainly why I got my two doses.

Unfortunately, it's looking like long covid isn't much affected by whether you're vaccinated or not - if you catch covid, you're almost as likely as an unvaxxed person to get long covid.

But of course, you're less likely to catch covid, so you do have some protection there - it's just not as strong as the protection against getting into the ICU.

&gt; A high number of unvaccinated adults would logically mean a high number of children in ICU logical even with lower chances of developing severe cases

I think you misunderstood my point. My point is that the rate of severe outcomes in children is high enough that the children's hospitals are becoming overwhelmed.

&gt; I would like more information before mandating our next generation to be vaccinated with a vaccine we don't know the long term effects. 

I too would love more information, but... we won't have it until it's too late. It's simple risk management - small risk from the vaccine vs. large risk from covid.

But, you are correct that when it comes to *mandating* this, there are valid arguments on both sides. I take the view of what's better for society at large is what we should do.

Which is to say, if mandating vaccinations will harm N people whereas not mandating vaccinations will see M people harmed, and M &gt;&gt; N, then we should mandate vaccinations.

I agree in principle and I fully support remote work where the job and the employee are a good fit for remote work. The two lessons we learned the hard way are 1)  jobs that are full time remote-work candidates are not the majority (speaking for my company) and 2) it requires a discipline on the employee side matched with the right supervisor.  We sent everyone home last Spring and have been trying for a balance that seems impossible to pin down ever since.

Sometimes the employees consider work from home to be a reason not to come on site even when needed (putting their new at home schedule before the needs of the job). We were very clear that on site requirements weren’t gone and people wold have to recognize that physical presence may be needed for some tasks so this shouldn’t be a surprise, but the pushback was big. We had a paradigm shift in management and not everyone was ready (not the majority in my experience). Some supervisors cannot manage remote workers effectively (the remote folks either get ignored and  left on their own or micromanaged). Also sadly, lazy employees viewed work as a secondary task and were basically simply watching email. In Spring 2020 everyone was giving the benefit of the doubt to these folks but not now - now it’s a few rotten apples ruining it for the rest.",,,,1629660702,{},h9y0zsv,False,t3_p9dd93,False,False,t1_h9xtw0x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p9dd93/remote_work_may_now_last_for_two_years_worrying/h9y0zsv/,1629724128.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

My hourly rate is $200-250 depending on how long ago I signed up the client (rates increase over time as experience and skill grows, but legacy clients get the early bird discount to some extent).

I had an excellent 2020 in all respects and my work has exploded as a result. I think a lot of that had to do with being able to focus on brief-writing and pursuing some very specific issues that paid off with a new kind of niche expertise (defending cases involving medical funding).  

Someone with a more piecemeal work flow or multi-disciplinary practice of law might not benefit as much as I did, but most lawyers aren’t able to be as efficient as I am either, because they have to bounce from subject to subject more than I do. I billed 2300 hours in 2020. Some of that was being totally unable to take any vacation, so I definitely worked more days. (On the other hand I had a toddler in my lap for a good chunk of the year).",,,,1629660456,{},h9y0fr8,False,t3_p9dd93,False,True,t1_h9xu81a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p9dd93/remote_work_may_now_last_for_two_years_worrying/h9y0fr8/,1629723833.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current surge is pushing ICUs beyond their baseline capacity and into surge mode. The Texas Medical Center exceeded its phase one ICU capacity of 1,330 ICU beds and is now in phase two, which offers an additional 373 beds. Of those beds, 114 are occupied. UTMB Health ICUs are also full, Sharma said.

Inside the Jennie Sealy ICU, nurses scan monitors with vital signs and check an array of IV bags hanging outside COVID patient rooms, identified by a yellow paper taped to each door that reminds all who enter to take “extended respiratory precautions.” Beeps pierce the sound of muffled chatter among the staff.

COVID-19 patients once again fill beds at UTMB Galveston's ICU, except this time they are younger and sicker on Wednesday, Aug. 11, 2021.

Some nurses feel a greater emotional weight from younger patients who need the highest levels of care.

“Just from a psychological standpoint, it’s hard because we identify with people that are our own age that are dying from this,” said ICU nurse Scott Woodby, who lost his father to the virus. “When we’re taking care of patients that are our own age with similar family situations, it’s just hard. It’s hard on the staff.”

Burchardt’s family also feels the toll of the virus. His wife, Sarah, and his two children miss him at home.

“His daughter randomly yells his name,” Sarah said. “She’ll scream for Daddy, and Daddy’s not around. So trying to keep them calm is another thing.”

His condition had improved over the last two weeks, enough to keep him on the ECMO machine. Burchardt will remain connected for as long as medical staff feel he has a chance of survival.

“Hopefully, he can have lung recovery and make it off ECMO or for a bridge for transplant,” nurse Kristine Galang said. “But it’s so difficult to say, because this course is a long course.”

Jacob Burchardt was among the sickest patients inside the eighth-floor intensive care unit at the University of Texas Medical Branch’s Jennie Sealy Hospital. Unvaccinated, he entered the hospital last month struggling to breathe. He has been fighting for his life since.

On his 33rd day in the ICU, where he lay paralyzed and sedated in a cramped room overlooking the ocean, medical staff prepared to wash phlegm and blood clots from the porous interior of his lungs. The doctor plunged the tube down his trachea, shooting water into the pink tunnels once healthy and flowing with oxygen. A cadre of nurses wearing gowns, gloves and goggles watched the process via a video monitor.

Burchardt, a father of two who did not have any major health conditions before his infection, reflects the changing face of the pandemic.

“A lot of young people are thinking they’re invincible, but we do not have immunity with this virus, ” said Dr. Gulshan Sharma, the hospital’s chief medical officer. “A lot of (young) people keep looking at how the mortality rate is 1 percent or 2 percent, but for them the mortality rate is either 100 percent or 0. ... Either he is going to walk out or he is going to die.”

A young, healthy population once thought to be more equipped to handle the coronavirus has been hit with a reality check by the significantly more contagious delta variant. Medical experts say lagging vaccine rates among young adults have fueled another surge that is sending them to hospitals in greater numbers, once again stretching the health care capacity throughout Texas

Previously in the pandemic, people age 65 and above made up the majority of hospitalizations nationwide, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. That trend began to shift in April, after vaccines became widely available. As of Aug. 7, most people hospitalized fall within the 18 to 49 age range, the CDC reports.

In Texas, COVID is infecting more people in their 30s than any other age group, with about 17,400 cases. People in their 20s are a close second, with about 15,900 cases.

Meanwhile, the average of daily COVID hospitalizations in the Texas Medical Center — now 369 — surpassed the all-time high of 360 set in July 2020.

For exhausted medical personnel on the front lines, the availability of vaccines makes the current trend both frustrating and disturbing.

“They don’t want to get the vaccine, and then we’re here trying to save them,” said UTMB nurse Marre Dang, who has been working two straight weeks at the hospital. “And they get younger and younger.”

Unvaccinated surge
While health officials consider the need for additional vaccine doses in vulnerable groups, the shots have proven highly effective throughout the current surge. Both Moderna and Pfizer are said to be about 90 percent effective at preventing symptomatic illness, while the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is roughly 73 percent effective.

Breakthrough infections are possible but rare, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study published July 30. The study found that breakthrough infections represent “well below” 1 percent of all COVID cases. The overwhelming majority of hospitalizations — about 97 percent — are among the unvaccinated.

Even so, only about 59 percent of the eligible population is fully vaccinated nationwide, compared with about 54 percent of eligible Texans. Nationally, 45 percent of people in the 18 to 24 age group are fully vaccinated, compared with 82 percent of those 65 to 74, according to the CDC.

Those statistics are playing out in the Houston region.

A walk down the Jennie Sealy ICU unit reveals a 19-year-old man and 20-year-old woman lying on their stomachs — a common treatment called “proning” — so their lungs have more room to expand. A 31-year-old man with no underlying health conditions needs a ventilator and an ECMO machine, a last-ditch life saving tool that delivers oxygen-rich blood into a main artery to give the heart and lungs a chance to rest.

Burchardt also needs the machine. A third man on ECMO died at the hospital last week, said UTMB nurse Yolanda Leyva, who leads the ECMO program there.


Made with Flourish
“We are giving them a chance that they wouldn’t have had,” she said.

ECMO is an aggressive treatment primarily used in younger patients, she said. The survival rate for the machine is roughly 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association. Using three ECMO machines at one time was “unheard of for our program,” Leyva said.

Young patients who need critical care at the UTMB hospital also rarely have any underlying health problems, ICU nurse Audriana Suhey said.

“Before, we were seeing older patients, and you had a lot of heart disease, diabetes, all of these things,” she said. “And now our patients don’t have those things. These are 20- and 30-year-olds coming in here and fighting for their lives.”

‘Really sick, really fast’
Young people are dropping the average age of COVID patients in general hospital beds and ICUs. Houston Methodist said the average age of its ICU patients dipped from 64 in the last surge to 54, with about 12 percent of those patients now in their 20s and 30s. UTMB Health also said its average COVID patient is now 10 years younger.

Out of approximately 40 COVID patients in the ICU at United Memorial Medical Center hospitals, more than 60 percent were 30 to 45 years old, said Dr. Joseph Varon, the hospital’s chief of critical care.

In the Memorial Hermann system, people between 20 and 50 years old now make up roughly 65 percent of all COVID hospitalizations, said system CEO and President Dr. David Callender. CHI St. Luke’s Health-The Woodlands Hospital recently had 79 COVID patients, 17 of whom were below age 45, said Dr. Syed Raza, the hospital’s vice president of medical operations.

“That was not something we were seeing before,” Raza said. “Before delta, a lot of that age group would get cold and flulike symptoms, and most of the time they were able to take care of it at home.”

There is no firm evidence that points to more severe illness in younger patients who contract delta. Anecdotally, medical professionals give mixed answers.

Raza said younger patients now experience more coughing, shortness of breath and abdominal pain associated with diarrhea. In some cases, their condition appears to deteriorate more rapidly than earlier in the pandemic, he said. Nurses at UTMB share that sentiment.

“With delta, it seems like they get really sick, really fast — faster than last summer,” UTMB nurse Claire Whited said.

In Callender’s experience, the delta variant is making the young just as sick as the older patients earlier in the pandemic, with a similar percentage requiring critical care at Memorial Hermann. A change in severity is also difficult to determine among children, said Dr. Michael Chang, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at UTHealth and Children’s Memorial Hermann Hospital.

He said some of the conflicting evidence might be explained by the sheer number of infections. More COVID cases in young people will naturally cause a greater chance of severe cases in that population, he said.

“It sounds like the stories are that the kids are getting sicker — that’s the impression you would get,” he said. “But at the same time it’s difficult to know, because delta is different than the other variants because it’s more contagious.”",,,,1629664392,{'gid_1': 1},h9y9b3s,False,t3_p9jcz8,False,False,t3_p9jcz8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p9jcz8/inside_a_galveston_icu_young_patients_once/h9y9b3s/,1629728786.0,112,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,3,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;Why are black people sicker, and why do they die earlier, than other racial groups? Many factors likely contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality among black people. It is undeniable, though, that one of those factors is the care that they receive from their providers. Black people simply are not receiving the same quality of health care that their white counterparts receive, and this second-rate health care is shortening their lives.

https://www.ajmc.com/view/racial-disparities-persist-in-maternal-morbidity-mortality-and-infant-health

&gt;American women die in childbirth at a higher rate than in any other developed country, while non-Hispanic Black women are more than 3 times more likely to have a maternal death than white women in the United States.

I wasn’t fully vaccinated at the time (had 0 doses on the first trip and had my 1st dose on the 2nd and 3rd trips), but I felt safe with the precautions we took. But then again, we have way fewer cases over here than Florida or even Texas, since our state actually cares about mask mandates. California requires indoor masking and masking in schools, so that lowers the case count. Even though both Disneyland and Walt Disney World have similar COVID safety policies, you have to look at what’s happening in the entire region as a whole, since people from each region visit the resorts and bring COVID with them, and Florida is doing a lot worse than California at the moment. I personally would avoid Florida theme parks right now since we do have people coming with us that are moderately high-risk for severe COVID.

In a year though, I think Delta combined with the next holiday gathering/winter surge, along with all the people heading to Disney World and Universal for Christmas and New Years is going to get a lot of people in Florida sick (so they get some antibodies to COVID) and convince a lot of the locals and regular Disney World visitors to voluntarily get vaccinated since they want to reduce the chances of getting sick.

Title:
Mayo Clinic Grand Rounds: 
""The Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic: The Most Dangerous Phase of the Pandemic""

It's a very informative Grand Rounds by Dr. Poland, the director of the Mayo Clinic Vaccine Research Group.


Following summary courtesy of Dr. JP Santiago:

1/ We have given up as a nation and as a world in this pandemic. Human behavior remains his biggest concern in this pandemic. We are now at one out of every 512 Americans has died of COVID. Exponential spread of the Delta variant is continuing unabated due to behavioral factors. Our behavior is costing us the battle in this pandemic. It will get worse.

2/ ""WE WILL NOT GET TO HERD IMMUNITY.""

3/ ""WE WILL NOT PREVENT EMERGENCE OF FURTHER VARIANTS.""

4/ No previous vaccine has been studied to the same degree and scrutinized to the same degree prior to release as the COVID vaccines. The risks and benefits of vaccination are clear and they heavily favor the benefits based on millions and millions of doses administered worldwide.

5/ Overall, if you are unvaccinated, you have a 3X greater chance of getting infected than someone who is vaccinated. If you are unvaccinated, you have an 8X greater chance of having symptoms than someone who is vaccinated. If you are unvaccinated, you hae a 25X greater chance of being hospitalized for COVID than someone who is vaccinated.

6/ With the Delta variant, if you had COVID before and are unvaccinated, you have a 2.34X greater chance of getting reinfected and the symptoms may be worse.

7/ Kids infected with the Delta variant get sick quickly. Data from Canada shows kids infected with Delta have a 2.75X risk of hospitalization compared to if they had been infected with the virus from last year.

8/ At the time of diagnosis, those vaccinated and those unvaccinated HAVE THE SAME VIRAL LOADS. This why we must mask up even if vaccinated. But in those vaccinated, the viral loads drop faster as the immune system kicks in. The Delta variant causes viral loads 1000 to 1200X higher than last year's virus.

9/ “We are doing a huge experiment with our youth. We are taking the most contagious viral variant, not letting them use masks and crowding them together to see what happens.”

“Not one single expert thinks this is a good idea.”

While there are benefits to in-person learning, it can ONLY take place with two simple measures- vaccinate all the teachers and staff and mandate masks.

10/ Very good data from the UK shows a 9X increase in infection and transmission in school age children with the Delta variant compared to last year's virus.

11/ Most medications in widespread use today have had far fewer study participants as part of their approval process than the COVID vaccines. Full approval is coming soon, but it will not change vaccine-hesitant behaviors.

12/ The mutation rate of the virus is inversely proportional to the vaccination rate. The more we vaccinate, the less likely we will have new variants. But because people will not vaccinate, we get variants and the variants are why we need vaccination mandates.

13/ The pandemic will not end given the way the American public is behaving. We are on the verge of the emergence of a variant that will set us back at square one all over again.

14/ We do not yet know what level of antibodies are protective. We call this ""correlates of protection"". We were starting to get early data on this, but then the emergence of the variants set us back in determining correlates of protection.

15/ The incubation period of most infectious diseases is long enough to spool up and activate our long term immunity. The original SARS-CoV-2 virus and to an extent the Alpha variant had a long enough incubation period (7-10 days from exposure to development of symptoms) to allow for long term immunity to be activated. The Delta variant has a much shorter incubation period (only 3 days, 4 days max from exposure to development of symptoms) with very high viral loads that may be overwhelming the activation of long term immunity.

16/ We have had prior warnings of coronaviruses with SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2012. There will be future coronaviruses that will constitute a threat to all of us.",,,,1629651406,{},h9xfg0f,True,t3_p9g47h,False,True,t3_p9g47h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p9g47h/mayo_clinic_grand_rounds_the_ongoing_covid19/h9xfg0f/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,d89a0a2863120f02e6e5d5ffb9b5433aba3b95b0,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1629651421.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Example, 20 unvaccinated and 10 vaccinated. 10 unvaccinated got sick would mean 50% of unvaccinated got infected. 5 vaccinated got sick, that’s also 50% of vaccinated.

I live in Ontario, Canada. In Toronto and some of the surrounding area, we were in lockdown from March to June, and then again from November to June. (Some things were open slightly in February, but it was only really malls at 15% capacity IIRC). Because of the mass disruptions to peoples lives across the country (curfews in Quebec, lockdowns in many provinces, travel restrictions in and out of Atlantic provinces), i think people had much more reason so get up and go get vaccinated because that was the only way to have restrictions lifted. The lockdowns and restrictions we had (that were more strict than almost everywhere in the US) were basically acting as a ‘stick’ to get shots into arms.

In the US, while yes conspiracy theorists drive a lot of the hesitancy, most people just didn’t care to get vaccinated because they either caught COVID or didn’t view it as a threat to them, and they already had most of their lives back. They could go out to eat, they could see their friends, they could go to the mall, etc. Especially since, at the time (and now as well) we told people they still had to mask up, so nothing really would have changed post-vaccination.

I would imagine in a country like New Zealand, that has been basically living like it’s 2019 within their borders, many people wouldn’t really care to get up and go get their shots because COVID wasn’t really something that was impacting their daily lives.

I guess what I’m trying to say is, when something is seriously impeding on your daily life, social life, and livelihood, you’re much more likely to set aside the laziness or hesitancy and just get the vaccine.

The most concerning thing is that in some situations, having low levels of antibodies relative to exposure load can actually theoretically increase virulence because the few antibodies present will attach to the virus, fail to kill it, and make it easier for the virus to interface with your cells.

Depending on how old you are, I would agree. But this entirely depends on your age and risk profile.

You’re assuming too much here. I believe there is cause for concern in both situations, and agree the known risks of COVID absolutely merit vaccines. Keep in mind that there is nothing wrong with holding this position and also questioning the details of these relatively under-researched mRNA techniques in the mass application of vaccines.

Again, it depends on age and risk profile.
