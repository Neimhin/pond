My school district provided Chromebooks to any student who registered for one and WiFi hot spots to any student who reported not having Internet access. They also got waivers to allow our special needs students to return earlier. I would argue that they have done an excellent job providing the students with the materials required to succeed in this situation. 

My attendance has been on par with what it would normally be; however, I have three kids who routinely don’t show. Two, I had last year. Both boys missed class frequently last year. Both work to help support their families. This has been the case for a number of kids. 

The other kid, when I was taking attendance the other day, wasn’t responding to his name being called. Another kid sent me a private chat in Zoom that said, “I didn’t want to be rude, but that kid is pretty sketchy.” The kid who sent me the message was right. The absent student was telling his parents that he was attending classes when, in fact, he was not. Of course, when the school tried to contact the father multiple times (no mother listed as a contact) they couldn’t. They could only reach the aunt, who had to call the dad “to trick him into picking up the phone.” My absent kid comes from a broken home and is acting exactly how many kids from broken homes behave. That’s not a condemnation of the kid, but it’s pretty standard behavior. 

My question is, how is this the schools’/school districts’ fault? 

The students absent from my classes would likely be missing school regardless of the pandemic. Their living situations are not unique. Kids all across the country miss school to help provide for their families, and while the pandemic has certainly exacerbated these situations, poverty isn’t new. 

Kids come from broken homes. To quote my student, some kids are “sketchy.” Where did my student learn to cheat and lie? Did his elementary school teacher teach him lessons on how to cheat the system, or did he learn that from his dad who was dodging the school’s phone calls? 

People think schools are here to solve everyone’s problems. People are eager to hold schools and teachers accountable, but there is little to no accountability for parents or students behavior. 

And to address the dead-horse argument that “this wouldn’t happen if all schools were private,” yes, it would, and the disparity would be even worse. 

My daughter was in private preschool last year. When schools were dismissed last March, they continued to charge full tuition for Zoom classes for a four-year-old. I was sending her because I needed daycare, not because I’m incapable of reading to her or teaching her to count. I was still being paid, so I paid my tuition. But what about the other families whose parents were out of work? If every school were private it would be like that line in Good Fellas, “Fuck you; pay me.” 

Schools, like every other service/business, are doing the best with what’s available. Everyone is going to have to step up to the plate and try harder.

I’m telling this story so you all remember this next time you hear Trump brag about how much ‘worse’ the pandemic would have been except for his ‘excellent’ response in closing people coming in from China.  Well, in regards to that; 

https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/the-facts-on-trumps-travel-restrictions/

-	he only banned Chinese people from travelling, not everyone so his ‘ban’ was utter bullshit, did nothing to stop the virus getting in. There were thousands of Americans who travelled from Wuhan back to America during his ‘ban’
-	he didn’t ban travel from other hotspots, such as Italy who also had one of the worst early outbreaks, he only banned Chinese citizens which is why many Democrats called him racist at the time
-	during the panic his ban caused where hundreds of thousands of people suddenly had to rush to get back home through packed airports, they had zero testing, zero temperature checks, zero contact tracing for those people re-entering the country. 

Make no doubt, Trump’s utter incompetence is exactly why the US has the world’s worst epidemic.",,,1601452625,{},g75j0wv,False,t3_j2bxt0,False,True,t3_j2bxt0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j2bxt0/white_house_overrules_cdc_on_banning_cruise_ships/g75j0wv/,1601453804,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1601453784.0,,

Ministerial governance is not complete bullshit. Here is a quote If you dont feel  like googling it.

Ministerial rule (Swedish: ministerstyre) is the informal term for when a public authority in Sweden — including the Riksdag, or a decision-making body of a municipality — tries to influence how an administrative authority (Swedish: förvaltningsmyndighet) decides in a particular case relating to the exercise of public authority vis-à-vis an individual or a local authority, or the application of legislation. This is a violation against the Instrument of Government,[1][2] the main part of the constitution of Sweden.

Nope, he's the one who mentioned the qualification of finding a restaurant that never had a shutdown.

Let me walk you through the conversation. Here's the original comment:

&gt;Anti shut down people can't seem to comprehend that **even if stuffs open people like myself won't go to any bars or restaurants until it's safe again and running a restaurant with slow business is more expensive than being closed**

This comment is saying even if restaurants are fully opened up, people like him won't go until it's safe. And the implicit assumption is that there's enough people like him to make business slow enough that it'll bleed the restaurants.

No mention of restaurants never having a shut down.

A response mocked his view:

&gt;If that’s actually the case, and if you people represent more than a minute proportion of the population, then you have nothing to worry about; the businesses will immediately come to the same realization and close down. After all, running a restaurant with slow business is more expensive than being closed, right?

He's trying to diminish how many people would actually avoid restaurants because of the  uncontrolled covid spread. He's saying all the restaurants in places without a current shutdown would close if the original commenter were right:

This is my response:

&gt;That's... exactly what's happening. Why are you talking as if restaurants aren't closing down in huge numbers all across the country even in places with no shut down?

I am addressing the fact that even in places that currently have no shutdowns, restaurants are still closing down. The point is that even if we pretend the virus doesn't exist and open everything up, restaurants will still be closing.

Then, the guy we are currently addressing came in with this comment:

&gt;Link? Most restaurants I know of are closing because operating at 25% capacity with 100% rent and 100% payroll isn’t financially feasible.

He didn't even say anything about places that never had shutdowns. He's describing places that have limited capacity rules.

After a back and forth, he shifted the goal post to saying:

&gt;I haven’t heard of any restaurants closing directly due to lowered traffic alone. Only ones that did close at one point before re-opening, in which case that was the actual nail in the coffin. 

Well, that's the first time anyone (he) brought in the qualification that you're referring to below:

&gt;Why are you mentioning other countries? He simply asked for any areas with no lockdowns that were undergoing a lot of restaurants going out of business. **You're the one that mentioned the 'qualifications' lol.**

So no, you're wrong. He's the one that mentioned it. I hope this clears everything up for you.

One plausible theory (because the mechanism is proven) is that tempertature (of surface respiratory tissues) can induce a biochemical change in a virus's spike protein that makes it more infectious.

The reason for this is is thought to be to take advantage of year-round flu in tropical reservoirs, allowing for seasonally raised infectivity. If a virus mutates to be too infectious, it could burn itself out (herd immunity). Having a tropical resevoir means a virus can have the best of both worlds. It can have a period of high infectivity to spread far and wide, but it has an area of the world with permanently lowered infectivity to replenish from if it over infects during winter.

SARS-CoV-2 does demonstrate biochemical changes due to temperature. Summer severity is much lower than the first wave, and although many things could explain this, simple improvements in treatment doesn't completely. Argentina and Australia both showed at least some signs that their winter seasons corresponded to more aggressive waves.

I think the question is: what exactly IS a company liable for when it comes to their employees' health? 

Two things I think are important here. First, under worker’s compensation law in the USA, if the employee was injured or BECAME ILL as a result of a workplace exposure, damages are automatic, but they are capped by statute.

The Occupational Safety and Health Act has a general duty clause, which says that employers are required to “furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees.”

Consider what workman's comp laws are, I'm gonna say that contracting an illness at work that causes death or physical harm probably counts. 
 
What TYPE of illness influenza vs. covid are is meaningless here. The main difference is that Influenza is a disease that has existed for at least 500 years. It is endemic, so people are exposed to it in every place, in every city in the world. There's nearly no way in the world to prove that one caught the flu at work vs. out in the community, because that stuff is everywhere. 

Although in some countries, companies DO view it as their job to protect workers from the flu, because if you keep your employees healthier, then you have more days of work from them, so it's actually both stupid AND callous to not provide paid sick days to help your employees stay healthy.

Compare the flu situation with that of covid. Covid-19 is a brand new disease that hasn't even existed for 1 year. It is not endemic, so people are not exposed to it in every city in the world. Which means that when it shows up somewhere, that particular place - which CAN be a workplace - it is a risk that becomes specific to that particular place, at least how I read it. 

And it becomes a LOT easier to show that the most likely place one caught covid was the workplace, IF that workplace had no safety precautions in place, or worse, known unsafe conditions for transmission of a new, spreading disease during a pandemic.

So, again - the type of disease is irrelevant. The situation the disease is contracted in, and whether it involved deliberate actions by a company that put their workers at greater risk than they would outside the company.",,,1601427852,{},g74jmpk,False,t3_j1y9n6,False,True,t1_g748xh8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j1y9n6/meatpackers_deny_workers_benefits_for_covid19/g74jmpk/,1601436139,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Sweden and The Netherlands for example doesnt count and report deaths the same way, you need to look at excess deaths. Netherlands has a lot more deaths than they report. Sweden has LESS excess deaths than reported Coronadeaths. 

Excess deaths per capita (per 100 000)

Regarding ministerial governance, you never heard of Konstitutionsutskottet? Thats the agency looking in to that type of issues its not the normal courts. Its not illegal to do specific things, like doing a strict er lockdown. Its illegal ( against the konstitution) for politicians to influence different agancies. It happends all the time that politicians are charge by konstitutionsutskottet. 

No not all countries have that, in the Nordic countries only Finland has it so you are wrong.

From Wikipedia:

Ministerial rule (Swedish: ministerstyre) is the informal term for when a public authority in Sweden — including the Riksdag, or a decision-making body of a municipality — tries to influence how an administrative authority (Swedish: förvaltningsmyndighet) decides in a particular case relating to the exercise of public authority vis-à-vis an individual or a local authority, or the application of legislation. This is a violation against the Instrument of Government,[1][2] the main part of the constitution of Sweden.

I worked as a recruiter for some studies at my university hospital and I had to do some independent research on diseases and present my findings publicly. Funnily enough, one of them was on the disparity of treatment for prostate cancer in relation to race, geography and age. Anyone can gain access to cancer data by sending a request to SEER. The thing about prostate cancer is that most males do develop prostate cancer, but it is not significant enough to cause harm to their lives. A lot of doctors decide to not inform male patients that they have prostate cancer because treating the cancer has more cons than pros since it is highly likely that the cancer will not effect their lives in any major way. The most common treatment for prostate cancer is ""watchful waiting"", which is when they just take a wait and see approach. Anyways, I wanted to see if there was a difference between how patients were treated. I do not necessarily remember my findings, but I there were some significant differences between the races. I had to add geography as a factor due to confounders. Most African-Americans live in the South. I would assume that Black-Americans in other states could possibly be recent immigrants. 

There are other issues as well. Such as socio or economic issues. Systematic racism plays a part (doctors are less likely to screen or prescribe medications to POC--but this is done unintentionally since when polled, doctors assume Black patients can handle more pain). Then we have the paranoia in the Black community (IDK if I mentioned this, but I am half-African-American) rooted in past experiments done on us. We are also highly religious and are more likely to turn to the church or prayer than go to the hospital. There are several things at work here that are getting in the way of proper care for Black people.

We have systematic racism stopping physicians from properly treating AA. We have paranoia rooted in previous governmental experiments (which are all quite recent, see Nixon's ""War on Drugs""--the government purposefully creating drug addictions in Black communities in the 80s), religious beliefs (pray the pain away), lack of insurance (they wait until the very last minute to get help--so maybe the cancer or whatever is now severe and harder to treat), access to care (there is a physician storage) and so much more.

Health experts warn that the measures agreed to by the ministry and the Madrid region are insufficient and come too late to control community transmission
-

If Madrid were a house and the coronavirus were the fire, the entire region would be in flames right now. Javier del Águila, a specialist in preventive medicine and public health, uses this simile to illustrate that the contagion levels being discussed by politicians as the threshold to introduce mobility restrictions “is like discussing whether to act when the fire has already reached the foundations of the building, or a little earlier.”


“It is already late,” he adds.

The Spanish Health Ministry and the Madrid region have agreed to introduce restrictions in areas with a population of 100,000 and over with a 14-day cumulative incidence of 500 cases for every 100,000 people, where 10% of tests are coming back positive, and where more than 35% of intensive care beds are taken up by Covid-19 patients.
-

But these thresholds are far looser than those recommended by relevant international organizations. The Harvard Global Health Institute says that stay-at-home orders should be issued when the incidence rate reaches 350 cases per 100,000 people. Madrid has a figure twice as high, but is not contemplating any form of home confinement.
-
Meanwhile, Germany has agreed to take measures in areas with a cumulative incidence rate of 100 cases per 100,000, the same metric used by Belgium to activate its most restrictive scenario. And Britain has been introducing confinements with a rate of 225 cases per 100,000. In France, the toughest measures are rolled out when the rate reaches 150 cases per 100,000.
-

Other indicators

Experts agree, however, that the incidence rate by itself is not enough to warrant measures. The two other indicators adopted by the central and Madrid governments contribute to a more complete picture, they say.

But again, the limits are too loose. The World Health Organization (WHO) notes that when over 5% of PCR tests come back positive, this can be considered to reflect community transmission. Yet in Spain, the positivity rate at which restrictions are required has been set at 10%. Right now the national average is 11.2% according to the latest report by the Spanish Health Ministry. In Madrid, over 20% of PCR tests are coming back positive.

Daniel López Acuña, a former WHO official, welcomes the adoption of specific limits in Spain, something that he and other colleagues had been requesting since April. But he says that three metrics are not enough. and that the primary care system’s ability to deal with Covid-19 cases should be considered as well. To these variables, Del Águila adds contact tracing capacity.

Too late for Madrid

The problem, according to a dozen specialists consulted for this story, is that it’s already late for Madrid. The region this week adopted new protocols to do PCR tests only on the closest contacts of positive cases and on vulnerable individuals.

“This is tantamount to admitting that the epidemic is out of control and that there’s been a failure. And it happened because they allowed it to happen,” says Del Águila.

Although there is no such thing as a scientifically indisputable metric to know exactly when to adopt looser or stricter restrictions, the problem with waiting until a location has the kind of levels seen in Madrid is that, at that point, it is no longer possible to keep transmission in check.

Now that new restrictions are about to go into place, the big question is whether they will be enough to make a significant difference. The figures will be reviewed every week in order to adapt the response, but many experts are already asking for stricter, and above all different, types of measures.

“We’re running late for mild measures such as reducing capacity at bars and restaurants,” notes Del Águila. “On one hand you’re allowing indoor dining, which is where the greatest risks lie, and on the other you’re shutting down children’s playgrounds, which are a lot safer. Maybe that would have made sense a month ago, when it could be controlled, but right now we are in a situation where you need to ask or force people to stay home.”

On the one hand, Rt is probably the fastest, most leading indicator for spread of the virus.  So it can potentially make sense to have a sub-1 Rt during a time when your area is peaking.  This would be because transmission rates could potentially be much lower as people begin following guidelines, limiting mobility, etc. but your state is still identifying and logging cases that were transmitted a couple weeks ago, or more.  Because cases are a slower indicator than Rt.

On the other hand, it's really just not that accurate in my opinion.  It's FAR from an exact science - almost too far to be very useful, it seems.  It appears to be heavily dependent on your state's daily reporting, which can fluctuate a lot for no real ""virus-related"" reason.  And at least on this site, a single day totally warps your state's entire graph.  So for example you might look on there one day and you're at a .97 and have been there since August, but then your state dumps a bunch of tests built up over the last 3 days and suddenly your state is a 1.1 and the graph shows it's been there for 2 weeks.

The new diseases doesn't start by killing everyone or killing young healthy individuals. It starts by killing the elderly, the weak, then it starts killing those who work as healthcare personnel in the culture, then it works its way all the way through the culture to killing the young and healthy. 

The chinese government let loose a force of nature and realising that it would cost them a huge amount of money, they failed to prevent it from costing everybody else,a huge amount of money as well. 

What we are facing now, is a virus that made young and healthy people drop unconscious without actual respiratory symptoms, in Wuhan, that is yet to cause the same symptoms in young and healthy people in our own countries. 

Regardless if you want to face it or not, you didn't get to live through peaceful times. We came to be at war with nature and nature isn't gonna be, *humane*, to us.

The only thing we can do as civilians, is limit the amount of spread as much as possible, while allowing the health industry, to develop vaccines and adjust those vaccines accordingly, as the virus mutates to evade our immunity.  

But what you cannot do, is pretend like you aren't in risk here. The virus doesn't care if you are healthy or young, it only cares about spreading itself and taking over cells to use for that purpose. 

As the virus spreads, you, and everybody else, is going to be subjected to higher and higher concentrations of the virus, and if you keep allowing that to happen, nothing is going to stop the virus from destroying your cells and your health along with them. 

Your attitude isn't gonna help you. Your disregard of other human beings isn't gonna help you. Your body haven't been through the natural selection of this virus, so you don't have any inherent resistance against it and you will *never* have, any inherent resistance against it. All you can do, is muster whatever humanity you have in your current communities, wrap your mind around what it means to work together, and use that, to prevent the depopulation, of our species.

&gt;Deaths per million population:

You may not be wrong here. The official Swedish government approach may actually **STILL** be veiled herd immunity. The leaked emails between Tegnell and others strongly indicate this, and the fact that no one in Sweden's public health administration has had the integrity to own up to their colossal decision making blunder shows no real course change has been made since. In fact, a former Swedish health official has recently been trying to convince Ireland to follow their wrong-headed herd immunity lead. Ireland, to their credit, rejected such foolishness outright. The milquetoast measures the Swedish government continues to make with regards to public health are simply window dressing for their closet strategy.  

Let's not forget that Tegnell was publicly proud of this herd immunity strategy before he saw the global backlash that the UK received for being first in pursuing herd immunity. Since then, they've played it on the down low.

We would have gotten a balcony room but we decided to get passes to the separate adults-only pool area instead. No fighting for pool chairs, no waiting for drinks at the bar, no kids in the hot tubs, platters of fresh fruit brought to us every afternoon. 

Plus it’s a cool way to see some new places and do some fun activities. I usually skip the overpriced cruise excursions and just do my own thing, whether it’s walking around town or finding a cool restaurant to try some local food or whatever. I do generally travel on a budget and it’s easy enough to find stuff to do for under $20. 

It’s not for everyone but I honestly *love* cruising. I’ve been to a number of all inclusives in Mexico, Turks and caicos, and Jamaica and I prefer cruises. I also find the gentle rocking of the ship really soothing, I sleep so well. Plus the stars in the middle of the ocean are magical.

2) good support for companies, so bar-owners don't feel a need to pack their bars to put food on the table or pay rent.

and 3) labor laws. You don't have a limited number of sick days to spend for the year, or any risk of losing your job because you are sick a lot.

[],,Mister_Met,,,[],,,,text,t2_3clhd3st,False,False,[],"There *needs* to be a **federal** law mandating masks **right fucking now**. Hopefully Biden/Harris will make it happen.

In many ways this doesn’t go far enough however, because often even people who wear masks do so wrongly. By no fault of their own. It just happens. For this reason there should be a task force of specialists who can monitor that these masks are being worn correctly. They can spread out into the communities and do this work.

As part of that, people who have willfully put their fellow citizens in danger need to be identified. This obviously includes anybody who voted for Trump. These people should have a special insignia on their masks so they can be identified by authorities for the sake of the public good.

Their children should perhaps have a slightly less conspicuous symbol on their masks — something to identify the very real risk they are in as a result of being raised by such enemies of society and of science.

As part of a new nationwide emphasis on public health, citizens should be encouraged to identify people who are “enemies” of this progress. Once identified, these individuals should be given a chance to repent and change their ways. But this progress will of course need to be monitored by the government, so they should have a third type of insignia on their masks, to ease identification.

To facilitate compliance with the new public health measures, a new agency of the government should be created. The task force I mentioned above can easily be adopted to this work. These individuals will be employed by the federal government but not identified as such. This is to help gain a measure of trust from the population. Their jobs will be to keep files on individuals within their purview, and update these files regularly to track progress.

Obviously people who willingly violate the new mask law will have to be separated from society — for the good of society, as well as for their own good. This will be dealt with humanely and fairly. Not at all like Nazis. These individuals will simply be separated from their families and society and moved to a safe place for a time being. All perfectly humane and fair. These safe places will seek to educate them to the evil of their ways and the harm they are doing to the world. Once re-educated they can be returned to society. Of course repeat offenders will have to be dealt with a little more harshly. 

But this will be for their own benefit. Eventually individuals who have proven to be a menace to society and a danger to the security of the state, will have to be permanently removed. This too will be done humanely, but the key is that it will be done for the good of the collective whole. Because in such a system there will really be no space for individualism. This selfish attitude is exactly what got us into such trouble in the first place.

So selfish activity will have to be controlled in all aspects of society, especially the economic realm. Individuals will not be allowed to hoard cash. A progressive tax policy will of course help this to be redistributed, to aid the less fortunate. With cash hoarding outlawed, banks will not have any reason to exist. So they can probably be done away with first. People who run these banks will have to be identified as enemies of the state and placed in camps until they see the error of their ways and can be returned to society. But of course they will not be allowed to enter in an advantageous position, but somewhere near the base, where they will be reduced to doing manual tasks that help the greater good. Needless to say they will also have a special insignia on their masks that identifies them as a part of this dangerous class of individuals.

Business owners of all stripes will have to receive the same treatment as the managers of banks. Of course they will be understanding and will welcome an opportunity to make amends to society. However those that do not will, for their own protection, have to be removed from society.",,,1601427252,{},g74ilmi,False,t3_j1yrz2,False,True,t3_j1yrz2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j1yrz2/coronavirus_face_coverings_under_the_nose/g74ilmi/,1601435567,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

My dad is definitely a “me, me, me” boomer.  He had me pretty late, and then had my little brothers in his 50s.

He didn’t pay child support for me, but he raised my little brothers in a pretty nice house... until he decided he wanted to enjoy his retirement and moved to another country. He sold the house before they were even out of high school and left them living with their mother (who he never married, specifically so she couldn’t get at his money) in an apartment.

Now he’s married a woman 25-35 years younger in said country and is going on constant trips and vacations and just dropped a few hundred thousand in cash for a nice house in said country. House will obviously go to new wife, so in his 80s he just transferred the majority of his liquid wealth away from the sons he arguably abandoned before they were actually adults.

He’s never really put anyone but himself first.

Now, his parents were no better to him, and he grew up dirt, dirt poor. Ketchup sandwich poor.

But he STILL had a leg up over millennials without ever getting parental assistance because things were AFFORDABLE when he was young.

He went to college in the 60s and he was able to pay for school and all of his living expenses for the year by working full-time over the summer and part time over the school year. I’m sure he worked hard, but it’s not comparable.

I did the math once and back then he could literally pay for college and room and board by working 20 hours per week at the federal minimum wage. He wouldn’t be living it up, but he’d be fine.

I looked up average rents then and now and compared cost of attendance then and now.

What he could pay for by working 20 hours a week would now require someone to work almost 90
hours per week at the federal minimum wage.

I’m quoting the peer reviewed CDC studies, you are quoting nothing.

Then I provide CDC numbers saying people have greater than 99% chance of survival if you contract COVID when under 70 years old. Even if you are older than 70 and contract it, you have 94.5% chance of surviving. Again, you deny the data from the CDC. I get it. It might seem scary out there, but the science says it isn’t.

Ok here’s another study from the CDC that studied the efficacy of masks.

“Disposable medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are loose-fitting devices that were designed to be worn by medical personnel to protect accidental contamination of patient wounds, and to protect the wearer against splashes or sprays of bodily fluids (36). There is limited evidence for their effectiveness in preventing influenza virus transmission either when worn by the infected person for source control or when worn by uninfected persons to reduce exposure. Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.”

That's not an idea that I have seen backed up a shred of evidence. So link to a peer reviewed study backing that statement up please.

&gt;Australia and NZ are not in anyway comparable to landlocked countries.

Australia had a major outbreak in Victoria, but stopped it spreading to any other states despite having massive land borders.  

NZ had an outbreak in Auckland and sealed the border to the region for 3 weeks, using the military and police.  That stopped the virus spreading beyond the city and the rest of the country never had to lockdown again.  

There is no reason a non-island country cannot stop the virus entering if they commit to completely closing their borders.  

&gt;But thanks for admitting that if you don’t stop it immediately, lockdowns have no chance of even pretending to do a damn thing.

That's not accurate either.  Lockdowns definitely slowed down the exponential growth in all those countries, it just came too late for those already exposed.  

Melbourne only brought in a lockdown when there was massive uncontrolled growth with 700 new cases a day. After 10 weeks of extremely severe lockdown they are down to single digit cases and the virus will soon be eliminated there.

I then took one of those bread tie-like things (I don't know what the proper term is) that you find on foil coffee packages (the ones that usually have the one way valve in the middle) and spent about 5 minutes with a needle and thread attaching it to my mask. My mask now has what equates to a coked-out version of the nose-bridge wire that you see on surgical masks, except its longer and much more resistant to deforming. 
It takes a few seconds to adjust before I leave for work every day, but it just works all day; there is no fiddling, and thankfully no fogging up my glasses.

I did also get 100ct of cheap adhesive aluminum nose bridge pieces off of Amazon for less than $10.

Be it people out protesting, be it people ignoring mask laws, be it people acting like it will go away after the election, or be it people calling into question the potential legitimacy of an FDA approval for a vaccine, even including one of the people running for my state’s senate seat, who said he would not take a vaccine approved by the FDA, or people I know, who know my situation, who say they will never take a coronavirus vaccine while Trump is in office. 

I have been locked up, quarantined, for 6 months, only having interacted with less than a handful of people. I have gotten tired of people throwing away critical science, especially preemptively, and especially science that will help lift this horrific situation from me, and lower the risk to my life, simply because of which sports team they support. I am angry that there is anyone who would consider  the FDA as compromised. I am angry that there is anyone who would consider a vaccine approved by the FDA to be suspicious. I am angry that people are being fear-mongered and misinformed by the media into taking, or supporting actions, that would put my life at further risk. 

I’m tired of this shit. 

Everyone is acting like selfish children, and everyone is treating millions of lives, including my own, as well as the entirely of our modern society, as nothing more than political pieces with which to get the upper hand in a political debate, and can be ignored when they are inconvenient to themselves. This isn’t just Trump, this is an issue across all of modern political discourse. 

Hell, look at reddit, hell even look at this subreddit, and it’s posts and comments, where politics is supposed to be banned. Far too many of the ones that reach higher level popularity are treating all of this as another regular political issue, and often use this to push their political beliefs. 

I honestly do not care if I alienate people anymore. I just really, do not care anymore. Nobody’s mind is going to be changed regardless, and I doubt, that had i not been honest, and forthcoming even if a bit hostile, you likely never would have responded, debated, or taken into consideration anything to actually challenge your beliefs. 

Though, at the same time. Practice what you preach. When you say “other people called me ridiculous for [insert ridiculous opinion]” don’t be surprised when people call you ridiculous in response. Your reply wasn’t any better, and was much worse in my mind with hostility: “I don’t think I can even engage with you”, “You are in denial (about things I never stated)”, and responded with “I mean, what are you even saying? Lol”. 

To end off this rant, I have to say the following: spreading misinformation, or unsubstantiated concern about vaccinations or health policies is spreading and encouraging anti-vaxxing, and is a risk to my own life. I still stand by my original point, and every point I have made throughout this. 

If you read this rant, thank you. I would be surprised if you made it this far, but I need a place to vent and explain my problems, especially with comments such as yours. Keep in mind, every comment you make can potentially influence the minds of hundreds of others, yours, was at least 300. I wouldn’t be surprised if your comment helped to reinforce a least a single person’s paranoia and fear around the vaccinations of coronavirus. That is my ultimate concern. 

I would like to note, through all my comments, none of this is intended to be any ill will towards you, but simply towards the dangers and risks posed by your comment, and the people who it has reached.",,,1601457738,{},g75n76f,False,t3_j1d9xb,False,True,t1_g74hlyq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j1d9xb/not_trusting_the_fda_black_doctors_group_creates/g75n76f/,1601457748,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Boulder County had it under control until they started classes at CU. All the younger people, freshmen, sophomores, etc... went out and partied non-stop. The hill was a goddamn shitshow. Now, the overwhelming majority of cases in the county are at the school and as a spread mitigation attempt the city passed this ordinance through a clause(?) that allows for it during a public health emergency. 

Pretty much all the younger people have been pissed about it. Some rightfully so. But they were all warned, get it together and be responsible for a month so officals can manage, and they didn't. Actions have consequences, and this is something that many of these students are in the process of realizing. 

I know that plenty of people are trying to argue that it's discrimination, but legally it isn't. The 10th amendment argument doesn't hold up, as it was enacted through previously standing legislation. 

This has the potential to rip through town, the county, and surrounding areas at an unprecedented rate and the notion is frightening. While the younger folks aren't the ones dying, transmission to older people can be lethal. This is well known, but still news to many, apparently. I think it kinda sucks, it's funny, and also necessary. 

Police aren't really enforcing it though, from what I've read online. Though town is empty as could be right now, which is freaky. Reminds me of April alot. Parties are still happening, people are still bitching about their ""right"" to ignore a health crisis. Nothing has changed. 8 students have been suspended though, and the school is taking action. Sadly the school also decided to open and then basically fucked the student body out of $50m in tuition before switching to online classes the day, or day after the refund window closed.

BACKGROUND: Testing of vaccine candidates to prevent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in an older population is important, since increased incidences of illness and death from coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have been associated with an older age.

METHODS We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial of a messenger RNA vaccine, mRNA-1273, which encodes the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-2P) in healthy adults. The trial was expanded to include 40 older adults, who were stratified according to age (56 to 70 years or ≥71 years). All the participants were assigned sequentially to receive two doses of either 25 μg or 100 μg of vaccine administered 28 days apart.

RESULTS: Solicited **adverse events were predominantly mild or moderate** in severity and most frequently included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Such adverse events were dose-dependent and were more common after the second immunization. **Binding-antibody responses increased rapidly after the first immunization.** By day 57, among the participants who received the 25-μg dose, the anti–S-2P geometric mean titer (GMT) was 323,945 among those between the ages of 56 and 70 years and 1,128,391 among those who were 71 years of age or older; among the participants who received the 100-μg dose, the GMT in the two age subgroups was 1,183,066 and 3,638,522, respectively. After the second immunization, serum neutralizing activity was detected in all the participants by multiple methods. Binding- and neutralizing-antibody responses appeared to be similar to those previously reported among vaccine recipients between the ages of 18 and 55 years and were above the median of a panel of controls who had donated convalescent serum. **The vaccine elicited a strong CD4 cytokine response involving type 1 helper T cells.**

CONCLUSIONS: In this small study involving older adults, adverse events associated with the mRNA-1273 vaccine were mainly mild or moderate. The 100-μg dose induced higher binding- and neutralizing-antibody titers than the 25-μg dose, which supports the use of the 100-μg dose in a phase 3 vaccine trial. 

&amp;#x200B;

(My two cents:  This is really important from a pandemic planning perspective. Currently, every nation's guideline have older adults lined up in the first group to receive the vaccine (possibly behind front line healthcare workers) but that is assuming that the vaccine works well to protect them. If the vaccine cannot offer older adults adequate protection, then the younger population would need to continue masking and distancing until they themselves are vaccinated, a process that would likely take many months, and judging by the past few months, it is highly questionable whether the population is willing to do this once healthcare systems are protected. We really, really need an early-release vaccine that works for the elderly. )",,,1601423708,{},g74cjq3,False,t3_j28f09,False,True,t3_j28f09,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j28f09/small_study_finds_modernas_covid19_vaccine_may/g74cjq3/,1601432153,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

People just aren't afraid of covid.  It's like an abstract notion.  A political one even.  So they get really fucking lazy about pulling up a mask over their nose.  The discomfort of inhaling warm air just makes them freak out.  They think they're drowning.  They rip the mask off or at least pull it down and let their nose out.

Most people breathe through the nose and will shed virus particles as they do, potentially infecting others if they don't cover it up.

But what about talking?  Talking involves both the nose and the mouth (unless you want to sound funny).  Talking produces significantly more droplets than breathing and propels them more, and most of them come from the mouth.  A mask that covers only the mouth should block the particles that come out of your mouth.

Coughing is an even better example.  You don't usually cough through your nose, and coughing produces a lot of droplets and propels them a long way.  A mask that doesn't cover the nose should still help reduce the spread from someone coughing.

So, yeah, as long as all people do is breathe, an exposed nose is the same as no mask.

First, there was more time to prepare. Genomic evidence suggests that Europe was the source of most infections that became evident in New York in early March. The US administration had three weeks’ more warning given the lag between initial rises in excess mortality in Italy and Spain versus the US Northeast. For the South, West and Midwest (accounting for 83% of the US population), the delayed spread of the virus should have provided an even greater advantage.
Second, the US has a younger population4 and COVID-19 mortality is significantly correlated with age.
Third,  the US has a lower population density than Europe as a whole and for large conurbations within, and viral spread is greater in more dense populations.5  
Fourth, the later onset should have enabled US authorities to take advantage of rapidly improving medical knowledge and capacity (the nature of the disease, treatment regimes, testing capacity, and the effectiveness of policies such as social distancing and masks).
These multiple advantages should have reduced US excess mortality rates relative to Europe, but instead rates far exceed those of Europe and its countries”

the world was black and white in so many more ways than one and you stayed on your side of the rail road tracks, quietly.

because after all, it could be worse. a plague consumed millions during the birth of their era. You could be dead.. or worse.. black.

They would have remained that way, torn, tattered, and silenced by the withering of the fields, of wealth, of human decency caused by the stock market crash, dust bowl, and depression that consumed the silent generation in their youth, as the 2009 recession and caronavirus does to us.

a certain orange plutocrat and those who follow his ""me first"" creed would have you to believe we should take a page from the era of silence. and remain silent.

and we've tried.

Most of us know we will die employed or because of a lack of employment. We have no savings, no hope, and many of us are so far in debt from just trying to survive or because we dared attempt to better ourselves through education.

We know that we cant even fall back on the hope that the government has the intelligence needed to pass a New Green Deal, the likes of which help bring the silent generation out of poverty and back into civility (for white folks, at least.)

We cant even rely on a World War 3 and a reconstruction period (which was the other thing that ended the depression.) because if it happens, it wont be ended with Nukes, it will simply be fought with them.

We're done being told that our intellect is no better than the ignorance of those above us.

We're done having our futures traded away, listed as failed assets, repackaged and resold as debt, and then stuck with the consequences while reaping none of the benefit of having our futures sold.

We're done being told we are not worth a living wage but we are essential at the same time. 

We're done with telling our children, the younger Zs, that they still have to watch where they go or what they say, or who they say it to. because they are black..latino..knows they are not a boy.. not white... they could be killed for it. 

Like they before us, we too would die for our children, and we are done burying them because they were too good for the system that destroyed them, just as it did us.

We're done being pigeonholed into ghettos, and then told that we created the ghettos.

Were done with our brothers being sent to jail and having their lives stolen over possession of a flower.

The god of the silent era said it best in his film, *The Dictator:*

***I’m sorry but I don’t want to be an Emperor – that’s not my business – I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone.\****

***I should like to help everyone if possible, Jew, gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another, human beings are like that.***

***We all want to live by each other’s happiness, not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone.***

***The way of life can be free and beautiful.***

***But we have lost the way.***

***Greed has poisoned men’s souls – has barricaded the world with hate; has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.***

***We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in: machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.***

***Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind.***

***We think too much and feel too little: More than machinery we need humanity; More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.***

***Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.***

***The aeroplane and the radio (and cell phones and cars and the internet..) have brought us closer together.***

***The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all.***

***Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.***

***To those who can hear me I say “Do not despair”.***

***The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress: the hate of men will pass and dictators die and the power they took from the people, will return to the people and so long as men die, liberty will never perish…***

***Soldiers – don’t give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you and enslave you – who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel, who drill you, diet you, treat you as cattle, as cannon fodder.***

***Don’t give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts.***

***You are not machines!***

***You are not cattle!***

***You are men!***

***You have the love of humanity in your hearts.***

***You don’t hate – only the unloved hate.***

***Only the unloved and the unnatural.***

***Soldiers – don’t fight for slavery, fight for liberty.***

***In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written ” the kingdom of God is within man ”***

***not one man, nor a group of men***

***but in all men!***

***in you, the people!***

***You the people have the power,***

***the power to create machines,***

***the power to create happiness.***

***You the people have the power to make life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.***

***Then in the name of democracy let’s use that power – let us all unite.***

***Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give you the future and old age and security.***

***By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie.***

***They do not fulfil their promise, they never will.***

***Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people.***

***Now let us fight to fulfil that promise.***

***Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers,***

***do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.***

***Let us fight for a world of reason!***

***a world where science and progress will lead to all men’s happiness.***

***Soldiers – in the name of democracy, let us all unite!***

The stats from everywhere back this up. If you want to have a look at the UK as an example the government showcased a shed load of stats today and older people are the ones full steam ahead into hospital. A fortnight ago it was mostly youngsters. 

As for this 'new strain' let's not forget Israel was a success story less than 6 months ago so the first wave didn't get as big of a foothold. Such a success the leadership was holding Corona conferences with New Zealand and Norway. Covid now has a foothold, most likely with the youngsters carrying the majority of the virus. That's why you are seeing young people primarily loaded into hospitals. The elderly will follow on an even bigger scale. 

I'm not saying covid isn't a risk to the young btw. But this reporting feeds into the narrative that everyone should lockdown and be panicking when in most cases healthy people under 40 have a 1 in 200 chance of developing an issue or worse in the short term. 

Again in the UK only 2 out of every 100 people who have died are under 50. Of those they are predominantly in their 40s. 

As for a new strain which is more vicious. A big alteration to its make up.  Maybe a cross contamination from pet cats who have caught it then passed it back to humans.

Their organisation immediately said they wanted the government to drop that demand. It was apparently way too much to ask of them. 

Now that the infection spread to 33 farms, they want the government to have predators shot and tested for sars2.

I just mentioned eagles and wolves because farmers in Denmark have been known to shoot wolves rather than just getting some dogs, a bullet is cheaper than a dog obviously and recently, a bunch of protected eagles in a nature reserve have been found dead. Presumably someone is poisoning them. 

It is always the same with some people, if they are told that they can't buy or cultivate a certain strip of land because an endangered species live there, they start killing the protected species that is preventing them from buying and cultivating the land. The mink farmers have had a disproportionate spread of sars2 compared to the rest of Denmark and it most likely have root in what their organisation said with not wanting to wear masks.

But now they want more wildlife shot, so it can get tested for sars2. 

Seriously, somebody should as the danish government *why* it isn't animal cruelty to allow the mink to be infected with sars2. I know they are just animals and not as important as human beings, but allowing them be infected and do nothing, *is* animal cruelty.

Everyone being isolated gets tested a few times, if they fail, they get sent home. 

But then, everyone gets loaded onto the ship, and it is an isolated bubble. The NHL made their bubbles in Toronto and Edmonton, in hotels and arenas, and had no positive tests. So it should be possible to have 4,000 people on the ship, with no covid. 

So then it just sails around to interesting places. But no shore days, if you leave the ship, you can't get back on. Supplies get brought on with cranes, no people contact.

And it just sails around until the pandemic is over. No masks, no distancing, just partying. You can leave if you want, but you can't reboard. It would need to be wealthy retired people, but there are lots of those that like cruises, and would like to cruise and not have to be isolated.

As a cruise company, that would be better than just having the ships sit and do nothing, you would think.",,,1601438739,{},g7539xb,False,t3_j2bxt0,False,False,t3_j2bxt0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j2bxt0/white_house_overrules_cdc_on_banning_cruise_ships/g7539xb/,1601446269,18,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Edit: even if I did catch COVID, like you hoped I would, based on the CDC’s IFR estimation I would have greater than 99.5% chance of surviving it lol.
 
0-19 years old - 99.997% chance of survival 
20-49 years old - 99.98% chance of survival
50-69 years old - 99.5% chance of survival
70 years old and up - 94.5% chance of survival

The data is in the table in the following link. Look at Scenario 5 and multiply those numbers by 100 to get the percentage of people in that age bracket who die from COVID. I’ll take my chances lol

No, you're lying. Yes, Sweden's trend is shit. ""No actually it's not *that* bad, got you!"" is not an argument. You realize this right? Now answer the question. What's the new excuse gonna be when Sweden's trend is no longer positive? We both know he's gonna make up something new now.


No, ""it can't happen in Sweden"" is the fallacy. If you see the pattern of corruption in Sweden, it is probably because corruption exists. There is no better explanation for why a government bureaucrat just keeps lying when it's politically gainful to do so. Tegnell is our Bagdad Bob. If doctors keep falling out of windows in Russia, it's because someone is chucking them. If Tegnell keeps making up excuses to not follow recommendations from the rest of the world, it's because of an ulterior motive and not because of his superior ""evidence"" or ""expertise"". 

If the Swedish government keeps letting Tegnell lie and force a quixotic, unique and deadly strategy on the Swedish population, it is because Tegnell's lies are useful to the Swedish government, not because of ""my ministerial governance and unique Swedish constitutional law and wise politicians that despite having no higher education respect science unlike the rest of the world"".

It will go into effect Friday at 5 p.m. and will remain in place through Oct. 23 at 5 p.m. Phase 2.5, which began Sept. 4, was set to expire Friday.

The change offers some relief to businesses that have said they have been treated unfairly.

Movie theaters, entertainment spaces and amusement parks can also reopen under the order.

Cooper said officials are cautiously encouraged by COVID-19 metrics, but there are warning signs for both North Carolina and the rest of the country.

“Our stability is fragile,” he said at a news conference Wednesday. “I believe that North Carolina can do this safely. But so I am clear, every gathering carries the risk of spreading this disease. Being safe means being smart and making sure others around you are doing the same.”

Here is a look at some of the new guidelines under Phase 3:

▪ Movie theater and conference occupancy is set at 30% capacity, or 100 people, whichever is less. In movie theaters, the capacity limit applies to each screen.

▪ Bars can open outdoors only at 30% of outdoor capacity, or 100 guests, whichever is less. Bars that don’t have outdoor seating can open indoor spaces to no more than seven people for every 1,000 square feet of outdoor area. The 11 p.m. alcohol curfew for on-site consumption stays in place.

▪ Outdoor amusement parks may open at 30% capacity. Indoor amusement park rides must remain closed.

▪ Large outdoor venues with more than 10,000 can open at 7% capacity.

▪ Smaller outdoor entertainment venues may operate outdoors at 30% of outdoor capacity or 100 guests, whichever is less.

Actually not much slower at all if the [mobility data](https://www.teliacompany.com/sv/om-foretaget/uppdatering/mobility-analysis/) is anything to go by.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You may not be wrong here. The official Swedish government approach may actually **STILL** be veiled herd immunity.

I'm sorry but I have to disappoint you again. The plan was never herd immunity, veiled or otherwise. The plan has been established for decades and does not  suddenly change when a pandemic comes along. Authorities have been trained to respond according [to this plan](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/contentassets/b6cce03c4d0e4e7ca3c9841bd96e6b3a/pandemiberedskap-hur-vi-forbereder-oss-19074-1.pdf) and to diverge from it would be counter productive. The plan states its goals:

&gt;**Society's goals in the event of a pandemic**  
&gt;  
&gt;The overall goals of the pandemic response are to  
&gt;  
&gt;• minimize mortality and morbidity in the population  
• minimize other negative consequences for the individual and society.  
&gt;  
&gt;Different strategies to achieve these goals are medical and non-medical measures and communication efforts.  
&gt;  
&gt;By trying to **reduce the spread of infection** and delay the course of the pandemic, there is a possibility that the top of the **transmission curve is** **displaced and flattened**. In this way, the burden on healthcare and society can be reduced as the proportion sick at a given time (the top of the curve) decreases, the time for preparation increases and **vaccines have time to become available**. Such an effect can be achieved with the help of medical measures (including antiviral therapy and vaccinations) and non-medical measures (including social distancing).

Whatever evidence you think you have uncovered (the emails were released, not leaked) and that Giesecke and Tegnell at times speculated a bit about herd immunity does not change the fundamental planning that has already been drilled into the minds of those in charge of the pandemic response in the regions (counties and municipalities).

The confusion about herd immunity stems from the former State Epidemiologist Annika Linde who wrote a piece where she speculated that the FHM strategy was to reach heard immunity as quickly as possible. This got picked up by international media, but Anders Tegnell [refuted that already on March 15](https://www.svd.se/tegnell-flockimmunitet-inte-huvudtaktiken) stating that ""Herd Immunity is great in concept, but that is not our main tactic. It is to keep the spread low and allow the hospitals to work without becoming overwhelmed. Experimenting with viral transmission is a dubious method."" Basically repeating what the plan states as its goals. Annika Linde later apologized for her claims to Tegnell but it had already become a meme by then.",,,1601496827,{},g77p5u3,False,t3_iy63hs,False,True,t1_g774cvy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iy63hs/swedish_expert_backs_controlled_covid19_spread/g77p5u3/,1601505068,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

In my highschool and early college days I used to be full of angst, anger, and depression due to outside circumstances and effectively watching my funds that would cover me through college collapse in front of me and my family become divided. This then followed by years of attorneys, court, family court forced counseling sessions, helping my mom cover her bills on occasion. This lead to antidepressants, which did not do anything frankly. 

After all of this, and years after coming off of antidepressants, I came to the realization that I wasn't angry about my up-bringing or the circumstances stemming from said up-bringing. I was angry, confused, frustrated about never feeling comfortable. Never feeling secure and confident about tomorrow 

It has been over a decade now since I could feel like I've been able to just simply ""breathe"". That said it's not all doom and gloom. I don't mention all of this because of a woe is me mentality. 

In reality this struggle to feel security in any sort of life became my core pursuit. My ""why"". The foundation of my drive. My only objective in life is to have built enough stable financial security to support a stable family life. 

Most importantly if kids were to come down the road, and I should preface this with this is the actual ""why"" that I don't openly talk about; that those future children do not know how to even ask the questions of security in which I've faced every day since the age of 13/14.

If that were the case the age distribution of all the covid patients wouldn't have changed. More cases in general would increase the amount of older cases too and kept the distribution similar.

40% of patients being young is extremely high. The risk of complications in young people is actually very low relative to older people. The numbers keep changing, but according to cdc rates of hospitalization we're talking 4x (age 50-64), 5x (65 to 74) and 8x (75 to 84) times chance of hospitalization in comparison to the 18 to 29 age group. The rates for death are far more extreme (30x to 220x for the older age groups compared to 18 to 29), so the article stating they are actually ventilating them is concerning, ventilating young patients should be relatively rare.

The only way you could argue your point is if the virus was just spreading among young people without overlapping with the older groups a lot more than it was before.

When you are exposed to a virus, it doesn't roll dice to decide if you get sick or not, but we use probability and models to represent the chances of getting sick nonetheless.

You keep doing this ""deaths/cases"" which is premised on faulty and incomplete data. It's not correct. First of all, there are so many more people that have had covid than show up on John Hopkins/ worldometers/whatever. Second of all obviously there's a stronger correlation between people who go to the hospital, or get a test because they are very sick, for an illness and and end up dying from it than the general population. So the data is skewed. Also, if you looked into a lot of the data sources, you'd see that ""outcomes"" is totally meaningless, as many places in the United States do not ever close cases, except when the patient dies.

All that said, it is not a ""pretty deadly virus"". It's similar in it's fatality to the flu, but seems to be more contagious. Try to view the facts from a fresh and objective point of view.

This is an illness that can present as asymptomatic, or mild symptoms commonly.  Wuhan was just an event where enough people showed major symptoms, that differed enough from existing viruses that it was investigated.

An increase in viruses from animals has long been a prediction of climate change. As humans cause things like deforestation we are reducing habitation for animals, and changing their behaviors. This causes them to come out to areas where humans are at a much more frequent rate.  You don't know what I'm talking about, as you said, so instead of dismissing new information, research it.

Yes, reports are showing more severe outcomes in obese people who are infected with COVID, but consider delving past superficial knowledge and fat shaming and take an extra minute to educate yourself. 

Maybe you’ve heard of Social determinants of health. These are factors associated with where one lives and the every day interactions around them which greatly contribute to their health outcomes. Now, think about obesity when you consider a children from the same city, but in two different zip codes or zoning districts. 

One zip code has a great education outcomes, there’s access to fresh groceries, such as a Whole Foods, Kroger, farmers market, or maybe even a community garden. Gyms, bike paths, and parks are nearby, and there’s a great walkability score- sidewalks available so kids are safe in the street. There’s a local community center and library too. 

The other zip code just within five miles or so away is in much rougher conditions. There’s industrial plants nearby, the county prison sits between the housing projects and the only public school which just defunded federally for not opening on time because their lack of access to electronic devices for their students. The boys and girls club was also defunded by the governor and the library was never rebuilt after a fire. On top of that, the only available access to food is the gas station connected to a McDonald’s. There’s no local health clinic not access to fresh food. On top of that, the only doctors available are not representative of the population there. 

Imagine the reality that those living in the first zip code are living 10-15 years longer than people living just 10 miles away. This is actually the case for many places in the USA which have been historically neglected, places where many minorities were born, raised, and die.  

There are so many more barriers to health, but housing, safe environment, access to healthy food and medical services are just a few to name. All these contribute to obesity today. 

Many people of privilege will quickly jump to simple minded conclusions that people make unhealthy choices leading to obesity and other comorbidities, but I beg you to consider these health and social disparities that make such a huge impact on people’s health.

After we got past the stock market crashing in March and things settled down a bit, it seemed to me like many politicians quickly became interested in reopening the economy as quickly as possible despite the many warning signs so they no longer receive as much pressure to increase spending on social safety net programs  (ex. guaranteed paid sick days, a better public health system,more direct payments to taxpayers to stimulate the economy, etc.).

 I feel a major reason why so many politicians (especially in GOP-led states) rushed to reopen was partially because they were afraid people would be asking for the government to actually do more for them for once after they were pressured into giving people a few extra months of decent unemployment benefits and a measly $1,200 check. 

They felt it was essential to get those people back to work regardless of the costs to human health since a bunch of people being at home for a prolonged period of time might start really expecting the government to do things for them they never had time worry or complain about before (which probably played into the momentum with BLM gaining alot of support earlier in the year).",,,1601439736,{},g754r1j,False,t3_j28dy0,False,True,t1_g74v0kw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j28dy0/disney_parks_to_layoff_28000_employees_cites/g754r1j/,1601446989,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

This is true, but you are drawing the wrong conclusion. You want those chains to burn through slower, not faster, so hospitals don't don't get too full at once. It does not mean more infected at-risk people, it's the same chains whether they burn through faster or slower, barring spill over because health services break down.

What would be better would be to break the chains of transmission, not facilitate them. 

herd immunity is generally the immunity that comes from being surrounded by immune individuals. The threshold you mentioned would be the point of complete herd immunity.

I'll admit I'm not an epidemiologist, but I did take a class on infectious disease modeling in grad school and what you are saying doesn't even fit into the framework of what I learned about transmission dynamics. The general form of transmission models is (number of infected individuals x number of susceptible individuals x transmission coefficient). I'm not super well versed in agent based models, but my understanding leads me to believe that speeding up transmission within a more social sub-group would only lead to infecting the nodes that connect with less social groups that much faster.

If you’re going to be in a mosh pit, yeah mask up, but passing someone on a 4’ wide trail is an absurdly low point of contact.

Same with beaches, maybe wear a mask on the board walk going to/from the beach if you want to be exceedingly cautious, but if you can’t be 100% on it at all times it’s pretty low risk.

Just go though the odds with me.

In 7 months only 10% of America has been infected. You’re contagious for roughly a week total, a few days before symptoms, a few days after, but let’s make it a full 10 days.

Let’s also say we have always only captured 10% of the cases.

So at the absolute peak in America we had 7,000,000 people infected at once. We know that asymptomatic spread is thought to be minimal and makes up 40% of cases, so that’s 4,200,000 actively shedding cases in the peak 10 days of the infection, and let’s say 1/3 of those people felt bad enough to stay home.

Now you’re at 1% of the total population of the country having an active infection and out in the world spreading it.

But even if you live with someone snd are in constant contact transmission is not 100%, so even if you come across a person on a trail who is sick and shedding virus (I don’t come into close contact with 100 people on my hikes, maybe you do), your odds of transmission in a few seconds of being close to them are exceedingly low.",,,1601501745,{},g780u8o,False,t3_j2qsbn,False,True,t1_g77w89s,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j2qsbn/yes_you_should_be_wearing_a_mask_outside/g780u8o/,1601511031,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

(23,823) / (8,399,000 * 0.27) = 1.05%

Reality, that number overstates current CFR because treatment methods have improved, but also understates it b/c we know excess deaths during this period were higher than the confirmed+probable death count.

So CFR likely somewhere 0.5% to 0.75% range.  Sure as shit not 0.02%... utter nonsense.

Invasion of Grenada was the last battle considered part of the cold war, supposedly, which was in 83. The Cold war itself was never declared, AFAIK, so it's kinda defined by the armed conflicts around it. As are all of our wars since IDK when the last time the USA was technically ""at war"" from a legal standpoint...just involved in lots of armed conflicts.

If you want to count the other [potential] proxy wars in Libya and what not [that are arguably ongoing today], then there still wasn't another event from Grenada until 86 when stuff started happening in/around Libya.

The cold war is weird, it depends what you consider part of it since the ""cold war"" is defining the overarching  proxy conflicts that  compose it. Generally it's seen as ending in '91 with the Soviet Union disolving...but we went back into war at the same time. But there were no armed conflicts, at the very least, in the aforementioned years. kinda like the ""war on terror"" encompases multiple wars/battles/conflicts.

Edit: If you consider us at war from 1947-1991 as part of the cold war the US has been at war pretty consistently since 1824,I think. With 1996 being the possible exception depending how you count the no fly zone enforcement.

""Happy"" to admit I may have missed a proxy war that we weren't ""officially"" involved in, though.

Turns out people care about what others think. A lot. There's a few sociopaths who really don't, but overall, people don't like being told they suck. If only one person tell them they suck, they can brush it off. When a crowd tells them they suck, they feel shame, and do something about it. Anyone who's been a teenager in their lives remembers the painful memories of trying to fit in. That doesn't go away.

Unfortunately, America's individualism makes it REALLY hard. The ""let everyone do whatever they please"" sentiment is VERY strong. It's really hard to get people to band together unless a couple of the topics I mentioned before are involved (in which case it becomes very very easy).   


It's unfortunate. Kind of a game theory problem. If everyone who feels the way you do would get together, it would work. But we're all alone individually, not saying anything because the others are not saying anything.

(And don't get me wrong: I feel the same way you do).

And that's why this country sucks. Literally, the same culture that prevents you from doing anything about your neighbor blasting their music at 2am or hushing people at the movie theater or in the quiet train car, is why people are dying left and right for lack of mask wearing.

Throughout the fall, Donald Trump has frequently intimated that a vaccine might be approved before the election. The President may turn out to be correct, although the product that’s most likely to beat November 3rd is called Xinxing Guanzhuang Bingdu Miehuo Yimiao (Vero Xibao).

&gt;”Chinese officials are thinking that Donald Trump might approve a U.S. vaccine before the election,” Yiwu He, the chief innovation officer at the University of Hong Kong, who has many years of experience in vaccine development in China, told me recently. “So their goal is to have a vaccine approved before that.” He expects that China National Biotec Group, or C.N.B.G., a Beijing-based pharmaceutical company that is the country’s largest vaccine manufacturer, will announce some level of approval for a coronavirus vaccine in October. A Beijing-based biotech investor told me that C.N.B.G., having neared the end of Phase III trials with two different versions of its vaccine, is currently filing application materials with China’s regulatory commission. In normal times, approval could take between six months and a year, but people in the industry told me that the process will be accelerated because of pressures related to both the pandemic and politics. (C.N.B.G. did not respond to a request for comment.)

&gt;In the meantime, many Chinese citizens haven’t waited for full approval before getting injected. The state press has reported that hundreds of thousands have already been vaccinated by C.N.B.G., under an emergency-use approval granted by the government. The volunteers include many government officials and pharmaceutical executives who received the two-stage vaccination. “I know a few government officials personally, and they told me that they took the vaccine,” Yiwu He said. “It’s middle-level officials—vice-ministers, mayors, vice-mayors.” He estimated that more than a hundred Communist Party cadres roughly at the level of juzhang, or director, have been vaccinated, along with many executives at C.N.B.G. and its parent company, Sinopharm, which is the largest pharmaceutical firm in China. “Every senior executive in Sinopharm and C.N.B.G. has been vaccinated,” He said, “including the C.E.O. of Sinopharm, the chairman of the board, every vice-president—everyone.",,,1601421820,{},g749akq,False,t3_j2a3kc,False,True,t3_j2a3kc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j2a3kc/chinese_citizens_are_already_receiving_a/g749akq/,1601430191,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Hence the targeting of the spike protein of COVID-19. How the virus actually infects various cells isn't necessarily relevant to the process of teaching our bodies how to identify the virus and target it with antibodies and other immune cells.

If you think about it many vaccines have been created in the past with no deep knowledge of how the virus caused the symptoms that were observed. We simply did things like introduced a weakened virus to induce immunity.  Similarly now we know the exact genetic code and as such can create fragments of the virus perfectly and introduce them to the body to allow it to learn to attack it. And we clearly know now that these new vaccines induce an immune response. 

Though we still don't know enough about immunity to discern if we are inducing the correct immune response or how protective it is. But the good news is the response looks similar to recovered patients. The only rub again is immune responses are not uniform so we don't necessarily know all the key immune markers to look for in the best possible immune response.

&gt; Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants, also known as the McDonald's coffee case and the hot coffee lawsuit, was a 1994 product liability lawsuit that became a flashpoint in the debate in the United States over tort reform. Although a New Mexico civil jury awarded $2.86 million to plaintiff Stella Liebeck, a 79-year-old woman who suffered third-degree burns in her pelvic region when she accidentally spilled hot coffee in her lap after purchasing it from a McDonald's restaurant, ultimately Liebeck was only awarded $640,000. Liebeck was hospitalized for eight days while she underwent skin grafting, followed by two years of medical treatment.

&gt; Liebeck's attorneys argued that, at 180–190 °F (82–88 °C), McDonald's coffee was defective, claiming it was too hot and more likely to cause serious injury than coffee served at any other establishment. McDonald's had refused several prior opportunities to settle for less than what the jury ultimately awarded. The jury damages included $160,000[citation needed] to cover medical expenses and compensatory damages and $2.7 million in punitive damages. The trial judge reduced the final verdict to $640,000, and the parties settled for a confidential amount before an appeal was decided.

&gt; Since Liebeck, McDonald's did not reduce the service temperature of its coffee. McDonald's current policy is to serve coffee at 176–194 °F (80–90 °C), relying on more sternly worded warnings on cups made of rigid foam to avoid future liability, though it continues to face lawsuits over hot coffee. The Specialty Coffee Association of America supports improved packaging methods rather than lowering the temperature at which coffee is served. The association has successfully aided the defense of subsequent coffee burn cases. Similarly, as of 2004, Starbucks sells coffee at 175–185 °F (79–85 °C), and the executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America reported that the standard serving temperature is 160–185 °F (71–85 °C).",,,1601433282,{},g74tv61,False,t3_j1yrz2,False,True,t3_j1yrz2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j1yrz2/coronavirus_face_coverings_under_the_nose/g74tv61/,1601441537,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I think the lack of sunlight in regions of Europe is pretty infamous, so...

Also, I think that the aggressive push for immunization as well as a more robust offering of immunizations for things that are less prevalent in Europe may have given them a bit of a boost too.

Keep in mind there are quite a few poor countries in the African continent, and I remember one of the presidents of one country being asked why they had no infections and what they were doing to stop it, and he replied 'we don't have any test kits, so we have no confirmed cases.'  Sometimes they just can engage in the same record keeping as others. If most of their cases are mild, and they don't engage in posthumous testing then their numbers will be lower. South Africa has more money and standardized care, which resulted in higher reported numbers. 

If you are poor and don't have access to a safety net you just wait it out and hope you survive and nothing gets reported.

I had another X-er coworker (from a gap year before college - 2000/2001) who built our whole product at the dot-com I was working at.  Then the market crashed, the company burned, and he ended up getting out of tech entirely and moving to Brazil to do international development work.

America has *never* been kind to people who don't roll with the punches and take advantage of whatever opportunities happen to be in front of them.

I've been reading a lot of fitness blogs lately, and [Mythical Strength](http://mythicalstrength.blogspot.com/2020/06/the-nutrition-post-weight-gain-loss.html) had a good one on his weight management strategy. Now, he likes simplicity, I like complexity, but I liked his approach to hunger management. ""What if you get hungry?"" ""That's fine, be hungry.""

Perhaps the study and methodology are sound, or perhaps the results are not representative. Either way, it's beside the point. If the study is correct, it just means that social distancing (especially in Sweden, a country that is not among the most crowded and that tends to naturally social distance a bit) makes not as much difference in pandemic results as other measures, such as enforcing or at least strongly encouraging mask wearing in public areas (and particularly indoor public spaces).  

Either way, Sweden did not take enough action, or they would not have nearly 10x the per capita death numbers of Finland and Norway (more than 10x in the case of Norway).  

&gt; Some wear them, but it is was not really recommended anywhere in the Nordic countries until recently.  

Exactly my point. The important measures were not taken early enough, and as a result Sweden has had inordinately high preventable death numbers.  

&gt; I don't doubt they considered if herd immunity was possible early on but that idea was quickly rejected...  

I don't agree. I simply don't see how you can come to such a conclusion when all indications point to the opposite.  

If you think Sweden's plan was at all similar to New Zealand's, then the fault simply lies in Sweden's execution. New Zealand's pandemic results are worlds different from Sweden's.  

I have no doubt that Sweden's actual plan was very similar to the UK's, as both have had nearly world worst pandemic results (for developed countries).

&gt;ISCHGL, Austria — They came from across the world to ski in the most famous resorts of the Austrian alps.

&gt;Jacob Homiller and his college friends flew in from the United States. Jane Witt, a retired lecturer, arrived from London for a family reunion. Annette Garten, the youth director at a tennis club in Hamburg, was celebrating her birthday with her husband and two grown children.

&gt;They knew in late February and early March that the coronavirus was spreading in nearby northern Italy, and across the other border in Germany, but no one was alarmed. Austrian officials downplayed concerns as tourists crowded into cable cars by day, and après-ski bars at night.

&gt;”The whole world meets in Ischgl,” said Ms. Garten.

&gt;Then they all went home, unwittingly taking the virus with them. Infected in Ischgl (pronounced “ISH-gul”) or in surrounding villages, thousands of skiers carried the coronavirus to more than 40 countries on five continents. Many of Iceland’s first known cases were traced to Ischgl.

If it were true that it is just lockdowns, and not the pandemic itself driving unemployment, we'd be so packed we could absorb the CA employees.  Quite the opposite, we keep letting them go in waves despite what are now entirely voluntary health ""suggestions.""

That is, of course, just Disney.  Similar story for Universal, etc here as well.

Those in CA have an actual UI system.  FL's is the worst in the nation, pays $275 for 12 weeks, has no money to match funds with any national program, and a large number of residents unable to apply for ANY federal assistance because the FL portal to do so has been largely non-functional, is designed to toss out any gig, self-employed, or other types of workers who should have qualified under federal guidelines, and our own governor said the system was intentionally designed to put up endless pointless roadblocks with the goal of making it impossible to collect.

The point from a public health perspective is that despite all of that, and every possible financial incentive to return to work, FL unemployment with barely any safety measures at all is significantly higher than many states with lockdowns... except we also have hundreds dying daily.

I'm all for ending lockdowns, but the very notion is nonsense without honest government reporting, TRUE sience-based guidance, and actual public health regulations being enforced.  There IS no economic recovery without a coherent Covid plan.  It's a fantasy.

Maybe things are different in CA, but we have none of that, and it shows in the stats.

The method is very clear: 

&gt;In this data, a journey is counted as a movement from one place to another where the phone has not had a stationary signaling pattern for more than 50 minutes. The distance of the movement varies depending on how many cell towers there are in an area, in e.g. in densely populated areas it is at least about 500 meters, in sparsely populated areas it can be several kilometers.

Telia is one of the largest operators in the Nordic countries and the data is of high quality as well as representative for the general population. It can be trusted.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Moreover, what about other crucial measures, such as mask wearing in public?

Some wear them, but it is was not really recommended anywhere in the Nordic countries until recently.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You flatly contradict yourself. If this is true, why are Giesecke and Tegnell bothering to speculate about herd immunity at all?

I don't really. I don't doubt they considered if herd immunity was possible early on but that idea was quickly rejected and they went with was already planned. What I'm trying to get through is that the measures clearly reflect the planned strategy, not a herd immunity strategy. The measures are very much the same that all the other Nordic countries put in place except for the short lockdown that Denmark did early on. You do not restrict public gatherings if you want to quickly reach herd immunity. 

But I will probably not be able to convince you that is not a herd immunity strategy in disguise. But it is in fact the same strategy that many other countries employed (or would). Here is [New Zealand's plan](https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/influenza-pandemic-plan-framework-action-2nd-edn-aug17.pdf). And here is the [UK's plan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pandemic-influenza-response-plan). They are all the same (at the core) and they follow the [WHO guidance](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331511/Critical%20preparedness%20readiness%20and%20response%20actions%20COVID-10%202020-03-22_FINAL-eng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Also, if Giesecke is just speculating, what business does he have trying to get others to follow his inane ""speculation""?

&gt;USA: Corona is 16 times more dangerous than the flu

&gt;In addition, the current podcast episode is about new findings on infection mortality - i.e. the question of what proportion of those infected with coronavirus die from the disease. A new meta-analysis from the USA, which is now available as a pre-publication, provides valuable insights, according to Drosten, because it excludes many sources of error. According to this, an infection mortality of 0.8 percent can be assumed in the USA.

&gt;If you use the mortality of people infected with the flu as a comparison, it becomes clear that the probability of dying from Covid-19 is 16 times higher in the USA than with the flu. In the early stages of the corona epidemic, many politicians - including US President Donald Trump - said that the corona virus was about as dangerous as a flu virus.

&gt;Mortality: Age matters

&gt;According to Drosten, the infection mortality rate in Germany is slightly higher than in the USA, because the average population in this country is somewhat older. The virologist considers a value of 1.0 percent or a little more plausible for Germany.

&gt;According to the meta-study, the differences in infection mortality between the individual countries are determined by the mean age of the population group examined. Drosten: ""Age matters and practically nothing else."" The younger a society, the lower the mortality.

&gt; As 2020 slides into and probably infects 2021, try to take heart in one discomfiting fact: Things are most likely never going ""back to normal.""

&gt; It has become a well-worn phrase our politicians, officials, experts, even family, like to lean on — an ultimate, elusive prize.

&gt; Perhaps it's nostalgia for the world of January, a place where daily life more closely resembled our past decades. Perhaps it's a bid to show control, to revert to a time when change was not so universally imposed upon us.
But January is long gone, and it's not coming back. And, psychologists will tell you, that's only bad if you can't come to terms with it.

&gt; ...

&gt; Yet permanently severing ties with January is not necessarily a bad thing, psychologists say. The danger comes from hankering for normalcy again, rather than getting on with working out how to deal with whatever is ahead.

&gt; ""Politicians who pretend that 'normal' is just around the corner are fooling themselves or their followers, or perhaps both,"" said Thomas Davenport, the president's distinguished professor of information technology and management at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts.

&gt; ""People who suffer tragedies eventually return to their previous happiness level,"" Davenport said via email. ""But I think that COVID-19 is a little different, because we keep expecting it will end soon. So there is no need to permanently change your attitudes about it.""

&gt; The human tendency to believe change is temporary and that the future will again resemble the past is often called ""normalcy bias.""
People who don't adapt to change believe what they remember as ""normal"" will return, and delay modifying their daily routines or outlook. Those who refuse to wear masks may be guilty of normalcy bias, Davenport said, since they perceive this intrusion into lives as a passing fad they don't need to embrace.

&gt; ...

&gt; Life is essentially a series of changes and adaptation, she said, and the latter is something humans do well. People tend to place more weight on whatever they are feeling in the moment, Lyubomirsky said.

&gt; Our circuitry tends to override our doomscrolling. ""We're actually more resilient than we think.""

&gt; As with everything, we will find out just how resilient we are, and the future may seem normal again, however different it is.

See? This is what I've been trying to warn all of you about! *We are NEVER going back to normal, no matter how much you wish you were!* The government probably won't let us, and the health experts unanimously caution against it. 

Stop thinking dangerous things like ""oh, I'll just go back to brunch the day after I get the vaccine in January"". You're *not* going back to brunch. Even after the threat of COVID is contained (which, btw, the vaccine alone will *not* let us accomplish fully), we are still going to have to make many permanent changes to our lifestyles. These can range from more online work, school, and shopping, to normalizing mask usage internationally, to completely changing the way nightclubs work.

We are all guilty of normalcy bias. ""Old normal"" is just a carrot on a stick. There is *no* ""old normal"" henceforth. That's why it's important to follow *science*, not *politics*, because governments often delude you into thinking that old normal is possible.

Guess what—when something threatens a large group of people, the governing body of those people usually don’t leave it up to individual choice as to where people can go. The governing body will make curfews, will enforce closures of various kinds...because a large group of people are directly threatened.

I wonder what the psychological impact for those 200,000+ families in the US are. Probably they’re more upset that they couldn’t go to Applebee’s for a bit. Yeah, that makes sense.  

Again, I don’t blame people for needing to work to live. Hell, I’m even sympathetic to the frustration that comes with the disruption of normal lives because of abnormal circumstances.

Honestly I looked up Colorado after your post and thought it was an ""ok"" example since it seems to have had something roughly approximating 3 waves now (late April peak, then late July peak, and now a late September peak), but it looks like even that can be largely attributed to testing.  The last time the state bottomed out was late August/early September, and at that time testing was about [8k a day](https://covidtracking.com/data/state/colorado/tests-viral).  Today, the 7 day average in the state is 15k a day.  Doubling cases over the same time period that you're roughly doubling testing is not really that concerning.  Percent positive did increase by about half a percent, but that hardly qualifies as a surge, and certainly doesn't validate some doomsday fall prediction.

&gt;
Coronavirus super-spreaders were behind the explosion of Covid-19 in India, the country with the most cases after the U.S., researchers said.
&gt;
A group of patients that included about 8% of India’s confirmed cases later led to almost two-thirds of its total infections, scientists said Wednesday in a study published in the journal Science. The research, based on tracing more than 3 million contacts in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu through Aug. 1, is the first major study of transmission in a developing country.
&gt;
While most research on the pandemic has come from China, Europe and North America, cases are now burgeoning in India and other developing countries, according to researchers led by Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics &amp; Policy who wrote the study. Barriers to health care are greater in these nations, and the risk of getting severely ill and dying from Covid is higher, they said.
&gt;
“We’ve never had this degree of information to say, hey, some people are really transmitting the virus in a massive way,” Laxminarayan said in an interview. In contrast with the super-spreader minority, 71% of confirmed cases whose contacts were traced weren’t found to have spread the virus to anyone.
&gt;
A nationwide serological survey showed that one in 15 Indians have been exposed to the coronavirus. Hospitals in several states are now struggling to secure medical oxygen, needed to assist patients with trouble breathing on their own.
&gt;
Data for the Science study were gathered by thousands of contact-tracers during India’s lockdown, when mass gatherings were banned, schools were closed and people were ordered to wear face masks in public. Almost 130 million people live in the two Indian states, accounting for about 10% of the country’s population. India has recorded more than 6.2 million Covid-19 cases.
&gt;
&gt;**Prolonged Close Contact**
&gt;
Both states reported their first SARS-CoV-2 infections on March 5. Health workers traced as many as 80 contacts per confirmed case, using skills and resources honed from routinely tracking potential transmitters of HIV and tuberculosis, Laxminarayan said.
&gt;
Prolific SARS-CoV-2 transmitters tended to spread the virus during prolonged close contact on buses and other forms of transportation, according to the researchers, who were also from Princeton University, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Indian state governments. In such settings, there was a 79% chance of an infection occurring.
&gt;
That compares with only a 1 in 40 chance of catching the virus from someone in the community who wasn’t a household member, Laxminarayan said. Children under 14, though, were found to be frequent “silent” spreaders of the virus, especially to their parents and peers.
&gt;
“This shows that even without schools being functional, children-to-children transmission seems to be quite important,” he said. “As terrible as it is to say -- with two kids at home myself -- it’s actually important to keep the kids home.”",,,1601494646,{},g77jav5,True,t3_j2szww,False,False,t3_j2szww,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j2szww/coronavirus_superspreaders_drove_explosive/g77jav5/,1601502115,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

After 6 months it’s been non stop talk about wearing masks, which is important, but I haven’t seen any of the leaders push for an exercise mandate or a discussion on enabling healthier foods. There’s been several papers that have come out saying that severe obesity is the key deciding factor of covid kills you or not. 

What's sad is it that in the year 2020, you have a 12 year old with severe obesity, and this should not be a problem. I feel bad for the parents that she died, but they got her to that point themselves because a child doesn’t know any better or have the self control in most cases. Imagine if the government subsidized healthy food during the shutdown, or tied stimulus to workout routines/reductions in BMI. Instead, we have people just sitting in their homes day in and day out ordering take out and getting scared from all the terrible news in the world.

The evidence is overwhelming, we have known that the USA has had an obesity problem, and it’s being highlighted by COVID-19.

We can easily afford to do a bulk purchase of Apple Watches or similar fitness trackers and start to turn around our countries underlying health.

&gt;Since the most recent nadir on Sept. 9, when the national rate was at 34,300 cases a day—still a notch above the April peak—cases have risen to 45,300 a day, a 32% increase. 

September 9 was the exact moment of a huge testing-related dip in national cases. It's literally the most misleading possible moment you could start from if you're looking at daily cases only, which they are. Testing dropped MASSIVELY exactly around that date. Look the [Covid Tracking Project data](https://covidtracking.com/data/national/tests). On September 6, the 7 day average of the prior 7 days was roughly 800k per day. For the period of September 7 to September 10, we did barely more than 600k per day. In the 7 days immediately following that, the testing average immediately climbed back up to 750k per day.  That's not a real decrease in coronavirus, nor a real increase afterwards.  It's completely irrelevant.

By the way, national testing for the past 7 days is all the way up to nearly 950k per day. I wonder why every time cases decrease anywhere in the country, all the top posts on this sub are screaming about how it's because of a decrease in testing, but here we have a ""big case increase"" starting September 9, and over that  same period of time 9/9-current, testing went from 600k to almost 1 million per day and nobody has a word to say about it?

This means we never had a full lockdown with curfews, just the strong recommendation to stay home when possible with emphasis on the personal responsibility of the public, closing certain categories of businesses and prohibiting large gatherings. It worked, although one could argue similar countries did better with full lockdowns. 

I guess I'm lucky we never had one and Germany was kind enough to take some of our patients. Halfway through our first wave masks became mandatory on public transport, but that used to be it.

At no point were people in the US unable to leave their houses during lockdown. If you’re imagining a lockdown where people weren’t able to do that, you’re not thinking of one in the US.

Unemployment was nice but my work is seasonal and I make way more during the time when I was completely off work than the rest of the year.
So while the unemployment and one trump bux check was nice I lost a lot of money on all of this and any work I get the rest of the year is going to be much lower paying.  I am working now but its hit or miss and I cant collect unemployment obviously at this time.

IM late 30s now and my savings was just under 10K so not huge.
Its been a rough couple of years due to the break up of my family so I've been paying most everything myself plus child support and have been unable to save anything other than retirement.  Basically I've been digging out of that hole that was dealt there even before this hit.  When my kid goes back to school I will hopefully be able to pick up another job and I should be able to work 2 (well 3 if you include my small business) and make things work.  Im hesitant to lose the house because its difficult for someone in my industry to get a home loan in the first place even when I had great credit but now my credit is really awful since she split and I had to scramble to make ends meet for a while.


One positive is *next* year should be really packed with work but you still miss out because there are only so many dates you can book and you cant compress two years of income into one year when you only have so many dates that are possible.  So people can reschedule to next year but I would have booked most of those dates anyway so its not like I can double book them to recoup the money.

I dont count on social security being a thing by the time I retire.    



One good thing about this is the government has made it less of a penalty to take your retirement/savings out because a lot of people are having trouble making it.

I dont consider my situation to be typical due to my industry basically being having a bunch of people in a large room together and my personal setbacks that happened in the years just before all of this occured.

[],,StandAloneComplexed,,,[],,,,text,t2_6fl0a,False,False,[],"&gt; Because it's the exact same political party still in power since 1949. The ordinary Chinese people have not been given a choice. No democracy.It's difficult to accept them as the legitimate rulers of their country when they give their people no say in the matter and they have no accountability.

This is a *very* simplistic view on a much complex matter.

In reality, the CPC might actually be the government that changed the most among its peers. You don't exactly go from being über poor (from being colonized left and right by Western powers, two wars of Japanese aggression, and a decades-long civil war) to an economic behemoth by functioning the same during 60 years.

You're also confusing legitimacy with direct elections. China [has elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_China) on a local level, but they have a different mechanism to select *competent* officials on the higher levels, pretty much based on results and performance, rather than voting the most charismatic leader.

Some people that are used to elect their head of state directly might pretend that not doing so makes it illegitimate anyway, and I'd argue you need to look at the global picture of the whole system to really understand why that's not necessarily the case (f.e. I can't choose my executive officials either, doesn't mean the country isn't democratic, or you could say the US president is illegitimate due to the EC, but it still recognized as legitimate worldwide).

Also, while the Chinese don't exactly vote to make their voice heard, it doesn't mean their isn't *any* other channel in place to voice their need, notably in the form of public opinion surveys.

As for accountability, I'd argue democratic systems allow any elected official to pretty much do whatever he wants once elected, just with the ""threat"" of not being reelected in a few years, but it literally doesn't even matter if the leader at that time took deliberate and disastrous action, like blowing up foreign countries at the other end of the globe, destroying multiple generations of people. Also, having election isn't a guarantee that policies will widely reflects the wishes of the majority of people, see f.e. this [study by Princeton University](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592714001595) (this is for the US, which is kind of an extreme case of corporation-led system but you get the idea).
And as someone pointed it out already, having a single responsible entity prevents the ""ping pong"" blame shifting game at each election cycle which is especially prevalent in 2-party systems, and which is honestly almost comical for anyone living in a real multi-party democracy.

So yes, *election = legitimacy* is a very, very simplistic or even naïve way of judging the Chinese system.

For those interested in learning more, I can recommend these short explanations to give a better overview:
* [A tale of two political systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0YjL9rZyR0) by Eric Li. It's 20 min short and also quite funny.

&gt; Over 70% of those who contract covid-19 do not pass it any further, while a minority act as superspreaders, the first detailed study of SARS-CoV2 transmission patterns in India has shown.

&gt; The study, which used the largest dataset of contacts of any global study, also shows that **children play a bigger role in spreading the virus than earlier believed**, and that **sustained shared travel is the most high-risk behaviour** one could indulge in.

&gt; fewer than 10% of index cases were responsible for nearly 60% of further infections

&gt; Superspreading as an event is a common misconception, Laxminarayan said. “Superspreading refers to the fact that some proportion of people transmit much more than other people. It doesn’t require an event.""

&gt; By far the most high risk interaction was being in close proximity to an index case in shared transport for **six hours or longer** - **nearly eight out of ten contacts** in such cases tested positive. 

&gt; Living in a shared household carried the next highest risk. But the risk of infection was much lower than in the case of co-travellers. **Less than 10% of contacts in shared households tested positive**, the study showed.

&gt; while in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, incidence peaks at an earlier age, and then drops off continuously.

&gt; In half of the cases involving a death in which the person tested positive before dying, **just six or fewer days elapsed between testing and the person’s death.**

haven't found the original study, looks very interesting: 

&gt; Researchers led by Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Washington-based Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, were given access to the full contact tracing dataset of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh states from the beginning of the pandemic, until 1 August

So, I've been on about 10 cruises in the Caribbean, all on Royal Caribbean.  

Granted, my last one was about 12 years ago, so I'm not sure if things have changed.  

I learned a lot though on all of them, experienced cultures, customs, etc.  

RC use to have some really great shore excursions available to take.  

I visited local museums, greenhouses, farms, historical sites, conservation sites, etc.  

Even simple excursions like snorkeling usually included the guides teaching about the marine life you see, or a couple times the history of some shipwrecks we saw.  

On a lot of the islands, we could go wherever we wanted as long as we were back in time.  


Is it not the same now?


I know there are some pretty bad environmental effects from cruise ships, but personally I'd like to see a future where more eco-friendly ships can exist, rather than just an end to cruiselines.

The difference between COVID-19 and other common respiratory illnesses is that, because it’s new to human beings, particularly virulent, and  easy to spread, it currently has the capacity to grow exponentially if left unmitigated. The flu doesn’t quickly spread through the entire population every year because of a combination of vaccines and natural immunities. This also means that those who are infected are less likely to have a severe case.

Wearing masks allows us to keep the spread of COVID at a manageable level while still engaging in many activities where the virus would otherwise get out of control. A scenario in which 20% of your community has COVID-19 within a couple months is a nightmare and far beyond the number of deaths, hospitalizations, and social distribution than what ever happens in a typical flu season.

[],,almaghest,,,[],,,,text,t2_h34a5,False,False,[],"I'm not arguing that Mulan was good and that Disney would have recouped all their money in normal times. What I AM arguing is that Disney felt like they needed to charge $30 (on top of the normal cost of Disney+) in order to have releasing it as VOD make sense for them, and customers balked at that A LOT, before reviews even came in (which then I am sure caused anyone who was on the fence to decide not to spend $30 to watch it.) 

For studios who have already spent $200,000,000+ producing a movie, it financially makes sense for them to at least TRY to hold out until next summer to see if they can get the same returns on their blockbuster films that they would've expected in 2019 and earlier.

My personal opinion is that we will see the 'blockbuster film' format die out in the next 5-10 years and we will see studios spending less on films because they will expect to make less money in theaters, and instead shifting their focus towards big budget episodic series that will drive people to existing (or new) streaming platforms (a la The Mandalorian, Witcher, etc)

Anyway totally not arguing that Mulan was good, or that this plan is good on part of the film studios, or that movie theaters in their current format deserve to keep existing, or any of that, just that I think the studios are experiencing 'sunk cost fallacy' on their finished (but unreleased) movies and that's causing them to resist releasing them for on-demand or streaming viewing right now.",,,1601475122,{},g76879f,False,t3_j2hvvq,False,True,t1_g765u9x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j2hvvq/movie_theaters_in_jeopardy_as_studios_move/g76879f/,1601475149,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Under each report on deaths, the government makes a disclaimer that not all deaths are from that day, because the reports are delayed and whatnot so we actually never know the exact figure per day. The data on the official sites and the one that the specialist quote are different and/or delayed. Explanation - ""I took the data directly form the hospitals"".  

This is in a country where they automated traffic fine collection - from registration, sending the bill, through the 3 reminders (if you don't pay), up to court proceeding. 

I can see the exact mm of rain on every street and house roof, but actual deaths - no.

Covid-19 management in NL is a total (criminal even) clusterfuck. E.g. there is not enough testing capacity - they expanded to 30k/day in May and did NOTHING to expand further. So now they send samples to - you won't believe it! - Abu Dhabi lab for testing. They stopped testing kids under 13years to spare capacity. They stopped contact tracing for general population and now inform only those in the high-risk groups.

Ok so I need to chime in here. I can't speak for this kids dad and for the sake of argument I will assume you are correct and he's just a deadbeat.

I work in a location where phones are not an option. Many people do. One problem I have and many of my friends have is that cultural expectation that we will answer our cell phones. We literally can't as we all leave our phones in our cars or at home. Phones in work would result in being fired.

Because of this, I am frequently assumed to be sketchy or dodging phone calls or ignoring important business (I have an important role in some volunteer work). This has been an issue for me for over 10 years. I tell schools constantly to use my work number to reach me and they always default to the cell number on file, then they have the gall to say shit like ""We called you multiple times but you refused to answer."" I stress to the volunteer organization that I am happy to do the work but they must call me after business hours and I can not answer my cell phone during business hours at all. I don't even know when it's being called!

Now I keep my phone near the premises so I can get my phone and make a call if necessary. This is rare but not unheard of. So, theoretically, if a school was calling my cell but not reaching me a relative could give me some bullshit excuse for why I need to get on my cell. ""Hey so and so is sick, can you get away from the office for a few minutes to talk?"" Yes I can this sounds like an emergency.

Basically I'm so tired of this assumption that not answering a cell phone is the persons fault. Maybe it's the callers fault for not following instructions. I'm so sick of people assuming the worst about others just because they don't keep their phone on them 24/7.",,,1601463701,{},g75sdi7,False,t3_j2grxe,False,True,t1_g75jk2p,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j2grxe/americas_missing_kids_amid_covid19_and_online/g75sdi7/,1601463712,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

What. The. Fuck?

They handed me my food and I parked, then went to the window and asked for a refund. I wasn't going to eat that shit.

I got my refund after telling the manager I was not eating food prepared by people not wearing their masks properly. Then I called the corporate office and told them what I saw.

Don't tell me you can't breathe in it. Health care workers do incredibly long shifts with masks on, and they breathe just fine. If your breathing is so troubled that a mask is a problem, then you shouldn't be working in retail or food service. 

COVER YOUR GODAMNED NOSE YOU SELFISH, STUPID MOTHERFUCKERS!

Plus, you can extent your stay at the hotel at a special rate at the end.

And I certainly would not support nationwide measure that would put California's response everywhere in the nation. Nor would most people. There would be violence if it was tried.

Like it or not, the way this nation is built... people need to work. Businesses need to open, and bills need to be paid, and there isn't a god damn thing our government is going to do to help the people otherwise. 

There are no safety nets (not capable of supporting this level of collapse).

**October 15**: Workers infected while prepping the ships begin dying, but don't worry, their cases won't be reported as US numbers.  The reporting will be left to their country of origin.

**October 31**: Ships set sail!  Look, it's back to normal everyone!!!

**November 3**: Don't forget to vote!

**November 6**: Arrive at your first destination, back home to Florida!  No other countries would allow you to disembark.  No worries, you had a good time partying with the crowds at the onboard casino, dance clubs, karaoke, and eating all you can eat peel-n-eat shrimp.

In small sample studies, about a third of SARS and MERS patients have had ongoing lung damage, in the case of SARS over a period of 15 years. 

And that's just lung damage. There's also long-term issues stemming from other health issues caused by COVID-19. Blood clots, heart damage, lung damage, neurological damage, even infertility and baldness. Even if each of these above symptoms are low risk of occurring (which some of them absolutely are high risk) the cumulative risk of persisting post-treatment issues is not insignificant, even if it cannot be said that a ""majority"" of people will have long-term damage. To me, even a 5% risk of permanent damage is an insane risk, let alone one in three people having lung damage for 15 years (and still going probably).

In the initial outbreak, high schools and up went to distance learning, but that's no longer generally the case. Limits were placed on public events, and the social assistance for taking off from work if you're sick got beefed up so you don't lose as much pay. Visits to elder care homes were also banned (until tomorrow, I think?). There are some other regulations that have been placed on restaurants and bars (tables need to be spaced out, can't order at the bar), and you get in at the back of buses instead of the front and can't go near the driver.

The intent has always been to flatten the curve so hospitals don't get overwhelmed, and to keep a consistent set of recommendations if possible so there's no confusion related to what the recommendations are - for years if necessary.

Impact-wise, a lot of people died in the beginning when it got into the nursing homes. Swedish elder care homes are more like hospice to begin with - in the best of times the life expectancy in them isn't great, and they honestly fucked up pretty bad. Things were improving since the peak in April until relatively recently, cases and deaths are starting to creep back up again now.

They've also instituted a bunch of programs to help business that were harmed by the reduction in people being out doing things.

What makes people flip their shit here on reddit is that there hasn't been a full lockdown, and the people in charge believe that social distancing is more important to reduce the r value than masks. The decision makers think - from looking at the behavior in other countries - that improper use of masks or from a false sense of security, people may pay less attention to proper social distancing.

They've also said that as long as things remain stable they don't plan on introducing new recommendations, but if things get worse they'll consider them.

Because most of Europe is not claiming that lockdowns do nothing to reduce the numbers of cases and deaths and thus are unnecessary.

Because the claims being made in these threads are demonstrably false - Sweden is not ""doing great"" it has not ""avoided"" anything. Its ongoing case load proves that.

And now certain actors are trying to use Sweden's current numbers as an excuse not to take the actions that prevented other nations from suffering the same horrible numbers Sweden suffered in the past.

But for the millions of Americans not working/invested in tech at the time, it wasn't nearly as serious. Roughly 2.2 million jobs were lost and unemployment reached a peak of 6.3%, and only after both the dot-com *and* 9/11 downturns.

They have socialization with other pod kids and keep up with their work. 

But here’s an example of a low income kid that I know of at our school- my friend is his teacher. His single mom works all day and gets off work at 5 pm. So, all day, he plays video games and watches movies. The teacher knows this because while he does sign into the Zooms, he plays video games or watches movies in the background-she can see it reflected. She literally BEGS him to do his work, and to pay attention, but he ignores her. She’s written the parent who ignores her pleas. 

The student has been offered in-school (our school is offering it for a limited number) but guess what? Any kid can start in-person next week, but there’s no after school care whatsoever. So he can’t go to school because his mom doesn’t get off work until 5 pm. 

This is just one kid who is not going to learn AT ALL this school year. And he’s already far behind. There are reportedly hundreds of these kids at the poorer schools in my area. I can’t even imagine how many all across the country. 

We need to figure out what to do to help these kids, stop wringing our hands and blaming our President or parents who can’t or won’t help, and soon. We are going to see huge problems in the future if we don’t.

One of the scariest articles about the virus now in what he is seeing at least. I only pasted some of it. 

&gt; Prof. Eliyahu Sorkin, the head of the ICU at Mayanei HaYeshua Hospital in Bnei Brak said that 40% of the seriously ill coronavirus patients in the hospital are young people – aged 19-50.

&gt; “This is a completely new phenomenon,” Prof. Sorkin said. “The virus is completely different than the first wave. Young people are becoming seriously ill enough to be ventilated.”

&gt; “We’re encountering situations that we don’t recognize from the first wave. Patients arrive from home, they’re still speaking on their cell phones, and then within a day they’re sedated and ventilated. All the prior classifications [of the virus] aren’t holding true anymore.”

&gt; “We’re seeing now what Europe experienced with the virus during the first wave. I don’t know if it’s the same coronavirus or if it mutated but there’s no doubt that it’s far more harmful. We’re seeing severe damage that we didn’t see during the first wave.”",,,1601485524,{},g76vnvz,False,t3_j2m8kf,False,True,t1_g76vavi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j2m8kf/covid19_patients_are_far_more_ill_during_current/g76vnvz/,1601488888,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

With coronavirus, over 200,000 have died in just over 6 months, and that's with all of the precautions we've been taking (lockdowns, events canceled, social distancing, masks etc.). [Epidemiologists have estimated that if we didn't take any precautions at all then eventually we would have had 1.7 million dead Americans.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/03/13/905318/worst-case-coronavirus-scenario-214-million-americans-infected-17-million-dead/)

Besides being significantly more deadly, covid-19 is also more contagious than the flu. On average, one person with the coronavirus transmits it to 2 to 2.5 other people, compared with 0.9 to 2.1 other people for the flu.

Covid-19 is also 30 times more likely to result in hospitalization, and the people that recover are more likely to have symptoms that linger for months or longer. You can read about some more of the differences between covid-19 and the flu here. https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-covid-19-isnt-the-flu

One more reason that people don't panic about the flu is because we have a vaccine for it, and we also have antiviral treatments that can lessen its severity. We are still 6 months to a year out from a covid-19 vaccine, and we are still learning about treatments, though some steroids have shown promise.

Having said all of that, you're right that if you're young and you have no underlying conditions then you don't really need to worry about it killing you, though you could get very sick for several weeks. [There are some signs that covid-19 could cause permanent heart damage even for those who are asymptomatic](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-19-can-wreck-your-heart-even-if-you-havent-had-any-symptoms/#:~:text=A%20German%20study%20found%20that,to%20have%20persistent%20myocardial%20inflammation.), but we still don't know much about that. A lot of viruses can cause inflammation of the heart and the effects typically are not permanent.

I'm healthy and I'm in my 30's, and my biggest fear is getting it and accidentally passing it on to others. If I get it and pass it onto 2 other people, and they pass it on to 4 other people, and they pass it onto 8 people, etc., then it's only a few more steps before over 100 people are sick because of me. Even though I would never step foot into a nursing home, maybe some of those people down the line work in a nursing home, or they live with an elderly or immune-compromised person. I don't want those deaths on my hands.

It sounds like you're already taking precautions though and that's great. I just think it's important to dispel the myth that covid-19 is no worse than the flu.",,,1601485408,{},g76vd79,False,t3_j1yrz2,False,True,t1_g76msso,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j1yrz2/coronavirus_face_coverings_under_the_nose/g76vd79/,1601488722,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1601485930.0,,

While doing so, she maintained a part time job at a cosmetics counter to supplement getting a place before we were married.  

Her friend, attended college for one semester and then dropped out.  She became heavily involved in the ""service industry specialist scene"", an attempt at a witty euphemism which means she's a waitress.  Her life became one of revelry.   Waitressing all day and evening, bitching about customers on social media.  But once they closed, everyone abused the in-house bar.  Falling down getting drunk, beer blasts on the weekends, being ""anti-Bush"", finding cause-celebras to act superior about.  Would call and want my wife to hang out and when she found out she couldn't because of class, she'd mock her about ""studying too much"". 

Today, my wife is a professor at a university at the age of 33. She's been looking at new cars recently, booked us a tour of New England next month, ordered us some recent cigar luxury boxes to try along with some new wines.  She even purchased a full length mink coat.  

By comparison, her friend lives with a man (not boyfriend) who is ten years younger than she is.  Because of COVID, she lost her job at the local pubhouse when it closed back in February.  She cried recently on social media because in attempting to try college again she claims ""it's too hard to understand now"".  She has no car and for the moment no job, living off unemployment scraps or selling homemade tarot card candles/necklaces on Etsy.

&gt;Vaccine scandal and confidence crisis in China

&gt;In July, China experienced its “worst public health crisis in years” as stated by South China Morning Post. Chinese vaccine maker Changsheng Biotechnology was found to have fabricated production and inspection records and to have arbitrarily changed process parameters and equipment during its production of freeze-dried human rabies vaccines. Furthermore, substandard diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT) vaccines produced by Changsheng Biotechnology were administered to 215 184 Chinese children; and 400 520 substandard DPT vaccines produced by Wuhan Institute of Biological Products were sold in Hebei and Chongqing. On July 25, China's drug regulator launched an investigation into all vaccine producers across the country. 15 people from Changsheng Biotechnology, including the chairman, have been detained by Chinese authorities. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31695-7/fulltext",,,1601430129,{},g74nnm9,False,t3_j2a3kc,False,True,t1_g74duls,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j2a3kc/chinese_citizens_are_already_receiving_a/g74nnm9/,1601438302,-2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

&gt;  
&gt;*Chad Dorrill, a 19-year-old at Appalachian State, recovered from flulike symptoms but then developed neurological problems.*  
&gt;  
&gt;By Shawn Hubler  
&gt;  
&gt;Chad Dorrill was in “tremendous shape.” Tall and slender. Played basketball. Ran long distances. But the 19-year-old college student died on Monday night, apparently of neurological complications related to Covid-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Dorrill, a sophomore at Appalachian State University in Boone, N.C., had been living off campus and taking classes online when he became ill with flulike symptoms, the school’s chancellor, Sheri Everts, [wrote on Tuesday in a statement to students](https://chancellor.appstate.edu/messages/id/208) confirming his death. “His mother encouraged him to come home, quarantine and be tested,” Dr. Everts said.  
&gt;  
&gt;He tested positive for the coronavirus on Sept. 7 and quarantined for 10 days before returning to Boone, according to his uncle David Dorrill, who said he lives seven houses away from the family in Wallburg, N.C., near Winston-Salem. He said that after his nephew returned to college, he almost immediately began experiencing serious neurological problems.  
&gt;  
&gt;“When he tried to get out of bed,” Mr. Dorrill said, “his legs were not working, and my brother had to carry him to the car and take him to the emergency room. The doctor said it was a one-in-a-million case — that they’d never seen something progress the way it did. It was a Covid complication that rather than attacking his respiratory system attacked his brain.”  
&gt;  
&gt; Although the coronavirus targets the lungs foremost, it also attacks the kidneys, liver and blood vessels, and a significant number of patients [report neurological symptoms](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/28/health/coronavirus-delirium-hallucinations.html), including headaches, confusion and delirium.  
&gt;  
&gt;Although colleges and universities have become [hot spots in the pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/11/us/college-campus-outbreak-covid.html), young, healthy people generally have been at lower risk for developing severe forms of Covid-19. Only a few deaths among American college students have been linked to the virus, [including a football player](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/sports/ncaafootball/college-football-death-jamain-stephens.html) at California University of Pennsylvania.  
&gt;  
&gt;A New York Times database [tracking the virus on college campuses](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-college-cases-tracker.html) has recorded at least 130,000 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic, mostly this fall, and about 70 confirmed deaths, mostly in the spring among college employees.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tonia Maxcy, a family friend who taught Chad Dorrill in high school, said doctors told the family that they suspected he had a previously undetected case of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare neurological disorder in which the body’s immune system attacks nerves. Many viruses can trigger the syndrome, and there have been [cases linked to Covid-19](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/opinion/coronavirus-brain-damage-dementia.html).  
&gt;  
&gt;“Chad was so kind,” Ms. Maxcy said. “Always a smile. Always a dance. He was that kid that everybody loved.”  
&gt;  
&gt;David Dorrill said an autopsy was being conducted. “He was healthy,” Mr. Dorrill said of his nephew. “He was in tremendous shape. Skinny. Could run six miles without any issue. He ran with us less than three weeks ago, in fact. He was healthy — until this hit.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Dorrill said it was not clear how his nephew had contracted the virus. “He told us he was always careful to wear a mask.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Colin McDonald, chair of neurology at Forsyth Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C., where Chad Dorrill’s parents removed him from life support at 8 p.m. on Monday, said that the hospital and the staff members who cared for him were “devastated” by his death.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We are doing everything we can to figure out why this happened,” Dr. McDonald said.  
&gt;  
&gt;An Appalachian State spokeswoman said the Dorrill family had informed the university of his condition last week. She would not say what, if any, steps the school had taken as a result, but she said the university had tested 7,569 students on campus as of Sunday, and 334 were positive, for a test positivity rate of 4.4 percent.  
&gt;  
&gt;In a now private Facebook post on the page of the Piedmont Pacers, a travel basketball team that Chad Dorrill had played with, a friend of his mother, Susan Dorrill, quoted her saying that “if it can happen to a super healthy 19-year-old boy who doesn’t smoke, vape or do drugs, it can happen to anyone.” The family confirmed that his mother had made the statement.  
&gt;  
&gt;“As our family suffers this incredible loss,” his mother wrote, “we want to remind people to wear a mask and quarantine if you test positive, even without symptoms. You have no idea who you can come into contact with that the virus affects differently.”",,,1601429565,{},g74mlp3,True,t3_j2cfvp,False,False,t3_j2cfvp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/j2cfvp/super_healthy_college_student_dies_of_rare/g74mlp3/,1601437743,31,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Once their reserves run out, they need to start selling their assets to have the cash to pay. What would you suggest they lose? The Star Wars franchise? Or maybe MCU instead? Or sell off some park land?

Mind you, I'm not taking their side. I fully support lockdowns and social distancing. But we should also look at both sides of the story.

The humane thing to do would indeed be to start selling so they can continue to retain employees. But since when is it a corporation's job to be a charity? If they start selling critical assets now, they would be in a weaker position to recover later once the pandemic is over.

Even more so in the middle of a pandemic when not all regions (in sweden and worldwide) have even had outbreaks?

Saying unfortunate things have happened because we've 'not done well' sounds like you think everything is something caused by human neglect or accident, that we were actually in control in the pandemic. I would argue there was little of that anywhere in the start and Stockholm was one of the early and hard hit, likely having a large unknown spread before it was declared a pandemic. Luck and very uneven spread has kept regions and whole parts of the world pretty much without outbreaks, or at least given them weeks more to prepare and start mitigations. At least I feel and think we've done darn well in many regards, like getting a large initial community spread down to managable levels, so I cant just agree with you.

I think the all nordic contries have done well, and are probably all in the top quarter with regards to how little impact the responses have had on our daily lives. I know it's true in sweden at least. About all save the crowd biz. continue to operate; not as normal mind you, but at perhaps the 'new normal'.

I'm more concerned with trends rather than absolute numbers (the latter depends more on circumstances), we've had declining numbers since early april, but with cases seeing rises now as well all over EU now we might actually be heading into trouble.

I'm sorry but your reading comprehension is not my responsibility u/mugi12.

 - I specifically wrote that I wear two layers of masks always, one cloth masks and one splash mask. 

I have been doing so since february, the first reported case of infection in my country was in march.

The health officials here **claimed that masks didn't work** and the government put a double fine on wearing masks unless for ""good reason"". Meaning that I risked being fined for wearing masks but still did it anyway. 

 - I also wrote specifically that I tend a person with chronic lung infection and therefore I had medical grade masks already which was bought before the pandemic. 

Before the pandemic, china made 80% of all medical grade masks. At that time, there was only 4 factories in Xinjiang that made PPE. 

After the pandemic china stepped up the production of PPE and now there are 51 factories in Xinjiang that makes PPE. 

Out of those 51 factories, there are already 17 that have been found to be using slavelabour. 

I also specifically mentioned that my country imports masks from china directly, which is due to the close contact that there is between the two countries. 

Perhaps you are the type of creature that is just looking for something to take your aggression out on. 

&gt;In that case then you must not be buying like 90% of all the products in the market since most things are produced in China. 

It is really not hard to google where something is made, perhaps you should try it sometime. I wouldn't be surprised if **you** have a hard time figuring it out but some people don't find geography &amp; geopolitics to be confusing.

I've always worked hard. Even when going to school. So my debts stayed relatively low. So that was quite easy to pay off. 30 hour work weeks on top of 28 hour school week. Never complained. My social life was none existent, but I didn't have many friends to begin with.


My father had his own company. I have seen it destroy him. Customers that wouldn't pay, increasing debts. We went from a 7 bedroom house, to a 5 bedroom house, to a 2 bedroom apartment. I don't want that. I don't want the stress that comes with my own company. I don't want to deal with the tax that comes with it. I'm perfectly happy making someone else rich. I'll work my ass off and I'll be happy about it, just compensate me in such a way that I can live. I don't need much, I just want to be able to do my hobbies.


I have a couple of alternatives. First one is very difficult to gain entry. I don't even know who to contact. I'll have some time to figure that out. It's working for the government. But there are only a few people in my country who do it. The alternative would be difficult as well. But it is closer to what I'm currently doing. They need people but they have a harsh recruitment policy. And I would have to buy myself into the company. The last one would be air traffic controller. Difficult to get in as well, but I already have a radio certificate and I respond well under stress. After that, I'm not sure.

It's really not.  A lot of boomers had to vote for the people completely dismantling the safety nets their parents put in.  See literally any R president over the last 8 decades.

&gt;  it's like saying it's the millennial's fault trump is president because he was elected during the millennial generation. 

Except we know that more millennials voted for Hillary, or not at all, than did for Trump, and we do know that older Gen X and Boomers were the main voting block who supported and *still* support the President now.  We have numbers to directly indicate that exact trend.  

&gt; to hate a whole generation, many of whom struggled and failed to achieve  the myth of  ""the Great American Dream"", and still are struggling is  hateful and sad.  

They really didn't suffer.  College was cheaper, all of their lives on average they have been covered by exceptionally generous insurance options mandated to their employers to be given to them as a result of government strength.  Right now the two youngest generations don't own entire homes like they did, can't afford families like they did, can't afford a basic medical emergency like they could, have no savings like they did, can't afford to open businesses like they could and lack even the most bare social nets that they had.  

&gt; it's absolutely a class thing and always has been..   low income senior housing is basically non-existent. 

A problem they elected people to cause.  Similar to but not limited too the insane amount of bloat of the DOD, the lack of Women's rights in several states, the complete lack of decent SS funding, a for profit healthcare and prison system, the lack of regulations on guns, etc.  A large majority of boomers got a massive layup in young age as a result of their parent's hard work and determination alongside their parents taking massive risks, where as in old age they have effectively kept cutting themselves with their own votes every step of the way, for the last decade Boomers have been a bigger voting block against initatives that would directly benefit them based solely on single issues.

&gt; not all born in ""boomer"" years had equal opportunities. 

A majority absolutely did have greater opportunities, even the oppressed, than the kids of today do.  This is including that despite the 1950s being heavily racist, blacks actually had a decent source of income, where as no 20 to 30 year old today is making even a fraction of what a Boomer made in a part time job working 3 part time jobs.

&gt; who will today's kids blame in twenty years? 

Putting it as a ""Blame game"" is more showing your actual ignorance than it is showing the kid's of today's attitude.  In the most literal sense they will have no one to blame in 20 years because they'll be under the constant thumb of nonstop climate change problems caused by, you guessed it, Boomers forcing through anticlimate politicians since at least the 30s, and especially post 80s.  An old boomer today was given literally endless potentials and opportunities that the kids of today can't even think of getting:  I can't get a full time job in my area that will actually pay well *and* cover my most basic meds because Boomers have voted to gut that as a protection, I can't afford housing due to most Boomers also being generational land owners often times owning many pieces of land to lease out and acting as a way to hand wealth down to their kids.

Boomers went to the far right because they were at the stage of benefiting off  of all the social advances of their parents without ever having to actively work.  For many Boomers they died LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG before they even began to see that their single issue bullshit would unravel America at it's core.

These are the two key assumptions. Current data is showing them to be questionable at best, wrong at worst. 

The key factor to the best of my understanding is the assumption of Homogeneity in the population. Each individual is equally likely to be infected, equally likely to die. Equally likely to have R(x) contacts with other people.  That simply does not seem to be true. Transmission quotient is not a constant.  It's a variable depending on most other factors.

I will be wearing my lab-grade PPE with my mad scientist costume. OR, pass out candy with a grabber, with the kids hanging out outside the barrier.

Combine that with the fact that most brokerages got rid of their trading fees and many are now allowing you to buy fractional shares, and I'd be willing to say it's probably easier for the average person to get involved in investing now than it ever has been.

That said, the old rule needs to be followed: Never invest anything you can't afford to lose.

Investments are still risky and take more effort than just using a savings account. But your reward for that is a historically high likelihood of generating passive income.

Open a Roth IRA and throw in $20 a month into an S&amp;P 500 index fund. That's a pretty modest savings rate. Do that from age 25 to age 65.

At 65, you'll have contributed $9,600, but you'll have $121,000 in the account. That's means you'll have $111,400 you didn't have to work for and is available to you tax free.

If you can manage to save $166 a month over those 40 years, you'll be a millionaire at 65 and only $80,000 of that would be money you had to work for.

Same exact thing as wearing a mask and practicing social distancing. Yes, most people will be fine.

Most people were fine when the first year of the original flu pandemic occurred, except for the weak, old and sick. But because enough people didn't take it seriously alongside the massive movement of people after WWI the second year it came back was the year it devastated the world.

The second year it decimated specifically those with strong immune systems because it had evolved and changed enough due to it being spread far and wide by people who were not ""getting that sick"".

They use the fact previous pandemics have changed things, pretty substantially in some cases. As evidence that we will never go back to how we where.

Which to be fair is true. Where I diverge from alot of them is I don't think the changes will be negative.

Social distancing will end, lockdowns will be consigned to the trash heap. But we will see an acceleration in alot of areas. Hygiene reasons has meant contactless and card payments have been boosted over cash.

Restaurants and supermarkets have ramped up kerbside pickup, mobile orders. Uber eats type delivery services. All of which were rising anyway but the pandemic has forced more established businesses to engage with apps and online systems like this.

The lockdowns may hopefully have put an end to the argument from middle managers that WFH is for the lazy shirkers. This could be a game changer, especially for young families. Being able to work from home makes childcare easier. 

Similarly the disruption may also help boost sick pay, as companies may cotton onto the fact paying sick pay for one employee is cheaper then that employee coming in and making the whole office sick. 

Is it optimistic? Absolutely. But I would rather focus on the positive changes. Plus its not without precedence.

The studies showing that universal mask usage is effective came out around August, and he accordingly changed his views on them in light of the new evidence. Those studies are nowhere near as conclusive as you think, which you would know if you actually bothered to read any of them. Anyway, FHM has clearly stated that it doesn’t rule out mask mandates in certain areas if the trend of low transmission changes. This is where you, yet again, come up with statements that are blatantly untrue:

&gt;...our trend is shit.

is simply false. There has been a small rise of cases in *some* places, but the rise isn’t nearly what you would call uncontrolled, and is still among the lowest transmission rates in Europe. As of today there are only a handful of countries in Europe with fewer daily cases per capita.

This is speculative nonsense.

 Sweden don't have them because we suck at stockpiling, manufacturing and make up our own speculations why they are bad. One social democrat top politician said, ""masks are not in our culture"". Nobody accused her of ""ministerial governance"", strange! I think this is the truth, top bureaucrats don't want masks for one reason or the other.

There were never any studies that proved ""masks might give people a false sense of security"". It was pure speculation and a left field excuse that Tegnell used to refuse doing right. Then when this was become completely untenable even inside Sweden, he had to admit he was wrong, but came up with the next irrelevant excuse. ""We have such a good trend, we should not risk it"". Risk what, doing the right thing! That turned out to be bullshit just one month later. What's the next excuse?

Of course you start to wonder why someone keeps lying and comes up with one irrelevant excuse after the next. What's the real reason.

Yeah I think seasonability is having an effect yes, because unlike you I look at data and don't rely on anecdotal evidence and make shitty assumptions from incomplete data. The facts are: countries that are culturally and geographically to Sweden have a death rate that is *5x lower than Sweden*. Sorry facts are inconvenient. Actually no I'm not. 

Notice here how I'm not using absolute numbers (which would obviously make Sweden look bad because they are much larger than Norway, Denmark etc) but rather proportionality. And in a proportional sense Sweden absolutely failed.

That child did not choose his situation. He’s only 8 years old. 

Teachers of low income parents who actually are good at their jobs quickly stop blaming parents and start trying to find solutions, with empathy. Many low income families are struggling day to day during normal times, many working more than one job for little pay. Many don’t speak English or have enough of an education to help their child themselves. I won’t even go into the problems with kids with special needs. 

And you know what? Most parents do better at parenting with help. The problem is that there’s little help for them right now. 

Again, those rich families are NOT doing this on their own. 

This is a huge societal problem and the virus has only made it worse. People may say “they’re not my kids” and “if I can do it, why can’t they?” but that does not show empathy at all or come close to solving the problems.

There is a wide generational gap: millennials (those who reached adulthood in the current millennium) have a lot of catching up to do in the wealth stakes. Americans currently aged between 30 and 39 years of age are calculated to have amassed 46% less wealth on average in 2017 than the equivalent cohort had gathered in 2007.


Those born in the early 1980s have an average wealth of $32,000 each, against the $69,000 those born in the 1970s had by the same age, said the IFS.

British millennials are £2.7 trillion poorer because of deliberate decisions taken by their parents' generation

Economists at the Federal Reserve have found that lifetime earnings tend to hinge on an individual’s first decade in the workforce, with those who earn less as they begin their careers never catching up.
The Economic Policy Institute tracked lifetime pay for employees who started work in previous recessions and found that as a group, they experienced lower wages and fewer opportunities.
And real estate company Zillow’s research concludes that graduating into the recession has an “immediate and lasting effect on young adults’ homeownership rate.”

The idea behind the Swedish strategy is that it is better to have sustainable restrictions in place for a long time, rather than constantly changing policies and switching between lockdowns and opening up. Covid is a marathon, not a sprint.

I do howevee agree that New Zealand did great, and they used lockdowns effectively. But you have to keep in mind that New Zealand is an island country out in the pacific, and Sweden is a country in the the EU and Schengen area.

Trying to eradicate the virus from Sweden without a vaccine is rather pointless, as even if it succeeded it would just be brought back in sooner or later.

From skimming it and looking over the charts, on most metrics those born in the early 1980's look to be doing better than previous generations, i.e. by age 25 the median household income is at the level that those born in the 1960's only reached by age 40 (Figure 1). I searched for the 32 &amp; 69 numbers you mentioned and they don't appear in the text anywhere.

The one concerning trend I do see here is that homeownership rates are definitely lagging compared to older generations (Figure 7).

This fits with other research I have seen that general wage stagnation is not actually as bad as most people think when you look at real dollars across the majority of the economy. But there are a couple of very important areas - housing, college costs, and healthcare - that are causing the entire problem.

IMO focusing in these key areas is critically important. Things like raising the minimum wage and getting marginal wage improvements for median income workers are great. But ultimately if your strategy is to try to raise salaries enough to outpace these key costs that are just growing like a cancer, you'll never be able to keep up.

A second note is that Trump said ""affect"" which can be taken as hospitalization or death. I wanted to provide hospitalization as well but I could't find the dataset I needed (plus, I spent more time than I should've on this), so we're stuck with deaths.

Choosing to sort by state and filtering for minors, the data is actually really in favor for Trump (if he means deaths) to the point that he'd be wrong.

The US has had 190 deaths of minors associated with COVID-19 with 21 coming from Texas and all the other states coming in clean. Minor deaths associated with COVID-19 is nonexistent in the majority of the US.

Now, even though Trump is technically correct, his logic is faulty (and there's more to just being factually correct like making logical assumptions).

Trump likes to link the low minor deaths to danger of the virus. This is shown by him saying to open up schools and not closing the country. But the numbers can't be used as evidence.

There are a lot of variables that play into minor deaths (and deaths in general) like, access to medical care, number of cases needing hospitalizations in the area, health precautions taken, medical supplies available, etc.

The virus can appear to be safe by the numbers, but it doesn't show how the actual virus behaves.

&gt; My city of Portland has had religious mask-wearing for months now, but cases have sort of plateaued/upticked in the last 2 months or so.  

Hmm I wonder if that has anything to do with the protests and rioting? Wear masks all you want, but if you're not socially distancing then it's meaningless as said by multiple sources far more reputable.  

&gt; Floridians and Arizonans are just that much more hygienic and diligent about wearing masks that Los Angelians and Portlanders?  

Are you kidding me? Florida is not doing well by any metric *especially when you factor in how their state government is lying about the data being presented*.

I'm literally not. I used the word indefinite, not permanent. 

&gt; And why do you think we can tell a virus exactly when to go away, because we need to know the exact date that we can open businesses again?

I'm not. We don't know when it will 'go away', or more accurately be under control and/or a vaccine rolled out. Which is why I use the phrase indefinite. Because it means we don't know. 

Business have been shuttered to some degree, and it varies depending on the state, county, and sometimes city. Its been that way for half a year now. There is no public safety net capable of withstanding that strain. Millions are out of work. Its going to get increasingly difficult for them to pay rent/mortgage and keep food on the table.

Which is why I say we cannot keep things shut down the way they are in some places. If we had Congress guaranteeing pay and unemployment benefits indefinitely (yes I'm using this word again), then we could shut down indefinitely. But Congress refuses to act... so like it or not, people NEED to go to work because they NEED to pay bills.

We've hung up a lot on masks, and they definitely help, but they aren't the heavy lifters here: staying home and staying away from other people is.

I’m saying this as a 6’2 230lb person who pre-pandemic was lifting 3 times a week and playing sports/running the other days.

Now I’m doing fine 1-2 lifts and cardio/basketball/frisbee 4 days a week.  And I’ve lost 10lbs at least since the pandemic started.

The reason I’m saying this is bc im a number of things:

- without children
- tech worker (well compensated + flexibility of time)
- young and no chronic problems.

The # of people in my situation is relatively small compared to the rest of the country.  You change even a few variables and suddenly it gets more complicated

When you have kids, they become your first priority and you need to do things for them first.  If you work in service or other non-flexible jobs, you don’t have the flexibility to cook a midday lunch like I can of healthy things.  If you’re not young and have joint/other health conditions (and let’s add in the fact that health insurance is either skipped altogether or extremely expensive for a ton of folks), your decision making gets more complicated.

EVEN IN MY SITUATION, it can be hard.  I’m already burning the candle at both ends between work, keeping up a house, and exercise and meals.
