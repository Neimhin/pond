Couple of questions; 1. do we actually know how natural immunity compares to the vaccines over time? I keep seeing studies and reports saying that both natural immunity and vaccine immunity wane over time, but I'm not sure how it's comparable (for the under 65's at least, I think there is universal consensus that, if you're old, you need to get vaccinated no question.)

2. I feel like the headline is misleading because we know that you can also get reinfected after getting vaccinated so my second questions Is, how does the reinfection rate compare between vaccinated and unvaccinated who she been previously exposed (have covid antibodies) people? This ties into the first question.

3. I literally see contradictory papers written by what I take to be reputable sources all the time either touting vaccine immunity as better or natural immunity as better.

**What we know about AY.4.2, a delta subvariant that's spiking cases in the U.K.**  
Matt Dunham/Associated Press  
The delta variant is still the overwhelmingly dominant coronavirus strain in California and the U.S., but one of its descendants is starting to gain traction overseas.  
Known as AY.4.2, it’s on the rise in the United Kingdom. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner, in a tweet Sunday noted that it now accounts for 8% of sequenced coronavirus cases in that country and said “urgent research” is needed.  
“There’s no clear indication that it’s considerably more transmissible, but we should work to more quickly characterize these and other new variants,” he said.  
He and other experts, including in the Bay Area, are keeping an eye on AY.4.2 — an offshoot of AY.4, which itself is an offshoot of the main “parent” delta variant.  
As the virus makes copies of itself, some small mistakes happen that lead to slight variations, which result in sublineages, said UCSF infectious disease expert Peter Chin-Hong. According to variant tracker outbreak.info, the delta variant now has 55 sublineages, including AY.4.2.  
In recent days, AY.4.2 has been “almost coming up from nowhere,” said Chin-Hong in an email. While only a handful of cases have occurred in the U.S. so far, it is something to watch, he said.  
Coronavirus Variants  
Is the R.1 variant in the Bay Area? What to know about the highly mutated COVID strain  
Is the mu variant in California? What to know about the new WHO 'variant of interest'  
“The tempo is the only thing we have going for AY.4.2 at this moment,”’ he said. “We don’t have as much biological plausibility that it will do much damage.”  
According to outbreak.info, seven AY.4.2 cases have been sequenced in the U.S. — one of them in California, in San Diego County. The others have occurred in Washington, D.C., Oregon, North Carolina and Washington state.  
While AY.4.2 isn't a concern yet in the U.S., Chin-Hong said that “as long as there are unvaccinated people, the virus will evolve and we need to be vigilant and track all of these variants and sublineages.”  
The delta sublineage is expanding in the U.K., according to the country’s Health Security Agency, accounting for 14,705 sequences — about 7% to 8% of new sequenced cases there. It contains two major mutations, A222V and Y145H, in the spike protein, and is among the variants being monitored by the agency.  
In a series of tweets Friday, Francois Balloux, director of the UCL Genetics Institute in London, said that the most common delta sublineage is now AY.4, accounting for approximately 70% of all COVID-19 genomes sequenced across the globe. He said the AY.4.2 sublineage currently appears mostly confined to the U.K. and “remains exceptionally rare anywhere else.”  
While it’s not an “obvious” candidate for the designation variant of concern, indicating greater transmissibility or the ability to escape the immune system, he said “it feels worthwhile keeping an eye on it.”  
Chin-Hong also said that experts don’t think AY.4.2 “will be stickier and more transmissible, make vaccines or monoclonal antibodies work less well, or cause people to become more sick.”  
That’s because of the way spike proteins work, he said. They enable a virus to latch onto a human cell and gain entry — but AY.4.2’s two major spike protein mutations aren’t in the place where the virus binds to the receptor, he said.  
Chin-Hong said no other variants are currently causing particular concern, but added, “There is a new variant being created every two weeks” and time will tell if another delta-like variant emerges. And the U.S. opening travel to vaccinated foreign travelers starting Nov. 8 can bring the risk of new variants and sublineages, as fully vaccinated people are still able to harbor the coronavirus, he said.  
“The virus continues to shape-shift,” Chin-Hong said. “The virus variants that seem to have an advantage are those that prize increased transmissibility over vaccine evasion. They seem to be fitter on the battleground.”  
He said the Bay Area’s high vaccination rates have helped keep the recent surge of cases lower, and we have a “large immunity force field that will at least keep us at bay for a few months, if not longer.”

I hear this question a lot. I think about it like this - imagine that a group of cavemen begin to realize that sabertooth tigers have entered their isolated valley and taken up residence. Every week another member of the tribe is ripped apart and eaten by the tigers.

The decision is made by the cavemen to always carry spears, always travel in war parties, and that children should never leave the safety of the caves and close by them. Everyone has to be on alert for tigers. Nobody likes this - they want to go frolic in the jungle like they used to, swim in the river, and pick berries and gather fruits on their own freely.

Some do, and some of them get ripped apart screaming and then they get eaten.

The cavemen obey the new rules, but they are angry at having to.

""How long to you keep this up for?"" many of the tribespeople argue.

The answer, of course, is until the sabertooth tigers leave, die out, are killed off, or can be driven away. The answer is: as long as it takes.

Because it is stupid to try to pretend the tigers aren't out there.

Because it is stupid to try to pretend covid won't kill people - maybe even you someday, after perhaps your fifth or sixth reinfection.

You keep it all up - the distancing, the masks, the vaccinations and boosters, until covid is somehow ended and is no longer a threat.

""But I can't live like that!""

Covid is more than willing to oblige that sentiment. Just dare it to. If you are serious. But a gun to the head would be quicker and less horrible.

Who are these people you might ask? Well this is a quote from their own website 

&gt;“**Homosexual conduct can result in significant damage to those involved who engage in such conduct**. There is no evidence that a person is born homosexual. And there is evidence that people can change. Our culture is being pressured with demands that our homes welcome, our daycares embrace, our schools indoctrinate, our businesses promote, and our laws reward this harmful sexual behavior.” – Liberty Counsel website, “Resources on the Family,” 2015.

The founder of Liberty Counsel also 

&gt;He has also **supported the criminalization of homosexuality both in the U.S. and in other countries**, stating in one instance that Malawi’s anti-homosexuality laws were in its “own best interests” after the U.S. reportedly withheld monetary aid to the country because of its efforts to outlaw homosexuality.

Immunocompromised implies that someone suffers from a condition that in some way reduces their immune response. Immunosuppressed refers to those (such as myself) that are receiving immunosuppressive therapies. It's clear that one of these is more permanent than the other, but keep in mind that many (if not *most*) people who are immunosuppressed will continue to be immunosuppressed for the rest of their lives. For instance, I will be on immunosuppressants for the rest of my life, as my condition is chronic and requires constant immunosuppression for treatment. Now, if there comes a point that all the treatments available to me no longer work, I'll need a surgery that will completely remove part of my large intestine, and at that point, I *may* no longer require immunosuppressants. This surgery is a last resort though, and chances are that I'll just be on immunosuppressants for the remainder of my life, as with many others who are immunosuppressed.

Regardless, this is an important distinction that should be made for your comment. As for your comment about organ transplants, you should read [this article](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/organ-transplants-without-life-long-drugs) to better understand the methods that reduce the longevity of the immunosuppressive therapy that you'd go through after receiving a new organ. Otherwise, you *would* be on immunosuppressive therapy for the rest of your life.

You're right that those receiving chemotherapy are ""transitory"", as you said, but I'm unsure what the proportion of those receiving chemotherapy vs. lifetime immunosuppressive therapy is. I certainly wouldn't say that the majority of *immunosuppressed* individuals are transitory, and I definitely wouldn't say that the majority of *immunocompromised* individuals are.",,,,1634695771,{},hhb9l9c,False,t3_qb8yap,False,True,t1_hh8ex1v,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qb8yap/vaccines_cant_fully_protect_the_immunocompromised/hhb9l9c/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,4a7bb5925320449ee124eb57de5a5298af31387d,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1634695786.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Covid is never going away, it will always be with us in one form or other.  Current vaccines don't completely stop infection, just reduce it, and protect against the worst effects.  Even if we manage to stamp it out then it will stay active in a pool somewhere and spread back as soon as people move around.

&gt; To solve this problem, the BNT162b2 mRNA has a modified nucleotide building block that doesn’t affect its ability to function as an mRNA, but instead makes it less of a target for our immune systems. It also turns out that this modification makes the mRNA easier to be deciphered into proteins by ribosomes, so they can make more of the spike protein faster. This means that the spike protein mRNA remains in our cells longer before it’s broken down, and at the same time allows more spike protein to be made at a faster rate.

&gt; So we’re almost there – only one more step from all that spike protein to a protective immune response – getting the protein out of the cell to where our immune systems can recognise it. This is where another feature of the vaccine mRNA comes in. At the beginning of the RNA code for the spike protein, there’s a special sequence that encodes something called a signal peptide. This sequence tells the cell that the protein the signal is attached to should be shuttled out of the cell. Once it’s out there, our immune cells recognise the secreted spike protein as foreign, and the immune response begins.",,,,1634710002,{},hhbxx16,False,t3_qax5p2,False,True,t1_hhay6xx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qax5p2/fda_to_allow_mix_and_match_approach_for_covid/hhbxx16/,1634849014.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;  
&gt;White House officials, anticipating the approval of coronavirus shots for 5- to 11-year-olds within weeks, will rely on doctors, clinics and pharmacies instead of mass inoculation sites.  
&gt;  
&gt;WASHINGTON — The campaign to vaccinate young children in the United States against the coronavirus will not look like it did for adults. There will be no mass inoculation sites. Pediatricians will be enlisted to help work with parents. Even the vials — and the needles to administer doses — will be smaller.  
&gt;  
&gt;Biden administration officials, anticipating that regulators will make the vaccines available to 5- to 11-year-olds in the coming weeks, are laying out plans to ensure that some 25,000 pediatric or primary care offices, thousands of pharmacies, and hundreds of school and rural health clinics will be ready to administer shots if the vaccine receives federal authorization.  
&gt;  
&gt;The campaign aims to fulfill the unique needs of patients largely still in elementary school, while absorbing the lessons from the rollout of vaccines to other age groups.  
&gt;  
&gt;This month, Pfizer and BioNTech asked the Food and Drug Administration to authorize emergency use of their vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds, a move that could help protect more than 28 million people in the United States. A meeting to discuss the authorization is set for Oct. 26, and an F.D.A. ruling could come in the days after, possibly clearing a path for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to make recommendations on a pediatric dose in early November.  
&gt;  
&gt;If that happens, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will provide reimbursement for “full funding to states to support vaccinations and outreach,” said Sonya Bernstein, a senior policy adviser for the White House Covid-19 Response Team. That support would involve site setup as well as logistical help like providing transportation to and from vaccine sites.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We know that access is going to be critical here,” Ms. Bernstein said, adding that the administration has in recent weeks looked at ways to provide a “kid-friendly experience that makes sure that we’re getting shots in arms with trusted providers in ways that makes parents feel comfortable.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The process will not look or feel the way it did when other groups in the United States were first authorized to receive vaccines. The 5-to-11 age group, with 28 million children, is far larger than the 12-to-15 group, with 17 million, who became eligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in May. But the younger group will not be expected to line up at mass vaccination sites: “We don’t want lines of kids,” said Ms. Bernstein, who pointed out that children tend to be more sensitive patients. (Read: They cry.) Pediatrician’s offices, children’s hospitals and pharmacies with in-store clinics will be the preferred options.  
&gt;  
&gt;The needles that administer the vaccine and the vials that hold it will need to be smaller to be more easily stored. (The Pfizer dose for children ages 5 to 11 is expected to contain 10 micrograms, rather than the 30-microgram dose used for ages 12 and up.) To keep doses from spoiling, the child-size vials can be stored for up to 10 weeks at standard refrigeration temperatures, and six months at colder temperatures, according to a memo administration officials plan to make public on Wednesday.  
&gt;  
&gt;Taking cues from what worked when shots were opened to teenagers, whose vaccinations generally require parental consent, officials are also leaning heavily on local health experts, who they believe are more trusted in their communities and can help reach high-risk children. “Children’s hospitals and health systems will be a critical part of our efforts to advance equity and ensure access for our nation’s highest-risk kids, including those with obesity, diabetes, asthma or immunosuppression,” the memo said.  
&gt;  
&gt;But while the administration aims to eliminate the types of availability and efficiency problems that plagued the initial vaccine process, reluctance has persisted among parents.  
&gt;  
&gt;[According to polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-trends-among-children-school/) published in late September, only about one in three parents of 5- to 11-year-olds planned to get their children inoculated “right away” once a vaccine is authorized. Another third said they wanted to “wait and see” how the vaccine affected children. But that same polling showed that reluctance among parents of teenagers had dropped in the months since vaccines had become available, and nearly half of parents of those ages 12 to 17 said their teenagers had received at least one dose.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19 are uncommon in children, [according to data](https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/) collected by the American Academy of Pediatrics, but experts point out that children are still susceptible to serious or long-haul versions of the illness.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Of course, adults are going to have much more severe diseases, but that doesn’t mean that children are not affected as well,” said Dr. Flor Munoz-Rivas, an associate professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine. “Children are typically ones that are vectors of transmitting the virus,” she said, and preventing them from getting infected “could potentially also have some effect” in slowing the spread of the virus.

It is not correct to say “vaccines don’t work”, or “vaccines work”. It is correct to say something like “vaccines cut your risk of infection by 80% and your risk of severe effects of Covid by over 90%”. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7037e1.htm

So if you have a 1% chance per day of getting infected without vaccine, then with vaccine that drops to 0.2% per day. 

Masks also help. Masks reduce the spread of viruses FROM an infected person TO I infected people, and well fitting masks reduce the number of viruses inhaled by people as well. Depending on the masks you’re wearing, the reduction could be 70%. https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776536

So when you have someone vaccinated with a 0.2% chance of getting infected each day based on their behavior without masks, then with masks that should be 0.06% chance of being infected per day. 

All these things multiply together. Vaccines, masking, distancing, ventilation, air filtration, etc. 

What happened with vaccines and public messaging is unfortunate. It looked like vaccines were going to be our ticket to not needing any other measures, because vaccines alone were going to sufficiently reduce spread and harm.  Then Delta happened, which is much more infectious. So we had to bring back some other measures. 

The big unknown right now is what are we going to do once we reach a stable number of vaccinations and recovered people. Will the disease at that point be mild enough that we don’t need other measures? Maybe we’ll still have other measures on public transit? Who knows.

This is not an issue of: ""i wont vaccinate so i dont have the tiny risk of mild myocarditis"", no, the issue is with missing your 2nd shot you increase your risk of severe myocarditis and other severe illnesses from covid infection. For the record im also young, male and with some heart issues. I encouraged my mums boss to get the shot as he also has a heart condition, bypass etc. After i told him to get a docotors opinion, who confirmed my encouragement of vaccination he got the shot.

&gt; Should I Still Get Myself or My Child Vaccinated?

&gt; Yes. CDC continues to recommend that everyone aged 12 years and older get vaccinated for COVID-19. The known risks of COVID-19 illness and its related, possibly severe complications, such as long-term health problems, hospitalization, and even death, far outweigh the potential risks of having a rare adverse reaction to vaccination, including the possible risk of myocarditis or pericarditis.

&gt; If you or your child has already gotten the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, it’s important to get the second dose unless a vaccination provider or your doctor tells you not to get it.

&gt;It was the first time the Supreme Court weighed in on a statewide vaccine mandate. It previously rejected challenges of vaccine requirements for New York City teachers and Indiana University staff and students.

&gt;Justice Stephen Breyer rejected the emergency appeal but left the door open to try again as the clock ticks on Maine's mandate. The state will begin enforcing it Oct. 29.

&gt;The Maine vaccine requirement that was put in place by Democratic Gov. Janet Mills requires hospital workers and nursing home workers to get vaccinated or risk losing their jobs.

&gt;Opponents tried to block the mandate, but a federal judge rejected the request on Oct. 20. The judge said the record indicated regular testing alone wasn't sufficient to stop the spread of the delta variant.

&gt;A three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals let the ruling stand in a one-sentence statement two days later.

&gt;The Liberty Counsel, which filed the lawsuit in federal court in Maine in August, claimed to be representing more than 2,000 health care workers who don't want to be forced to be vaccinated.

&gt;Dozens of health care workers have opted to quit, and Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston already curtailed some admissions because of an ""acute shortage"" of nurses.

&gt;But most health workers largely have complied with the requirement.

&gt;State agencies vowed to work with individual hospitals and nursing homes to address individual workforce issues.",,,,1634681362,{},hhaelky,False,t3_qbkgij,False,False,t3_qbkgij,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qbkgij/us_supreme_court_wont_stop_covid_vaccine_mandate/hhaelky/,1634816782.0,170,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As soon as they started administering the booster and VE against infection was restored, you see a crazy drop in cases and RT.  This is obviously multifaceted (it could have coincided with a lot of freshly acquired natural immunity), but it's pretty straightforward that VE against infection drops, and continues to drop with time.

There are no new side effects from a booster so it's low risk, but there's obviously no data on whether you can take a 4th dose at 12 months if that is found to be substantially better.. and given it already works well for severe disease, benefits are not huge either.

White House officials indicated that enough Pfizer doses have been secured to inoculate the 28million children in that age group in the US.

‘Today the Biden Administration is announcing a plan to ensure that, if a vaccine is authorized for children ages 5-11, it is quickly distributed and made conveniently and equitably available to families across the country,’ the White House stated on Wednesday morning.

The rollout is pending the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granting approval to the Pfizer jab for children five to 11 years old. The Biden administration anticipates the approval could come in a matter of weeks.

An FDA expert advisory group is set to meet on October 26 to review data on the efficacy and safety of Pfizer’s pediatric vaccine. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccine advisory panel is set to consider a recommendation for the vaccine use on November 2 and 3.

Pfizer’s pediatric jab will be cleared for use on children if the CDC director signs the recommendation.

In its plan, the White House stated that it would rapidly distribute the vaccines across the country to 25,000 pediatricians’ offices and other primary care sites.

‘These providers will play a critical role in the nationwide effort to get children vaccinated,’ the White House stated.

However, there are comparisons that *are* valid; such as seasonal changes in human behavior that increase infection rates of viruses that have similar modes of infecting people.

Due to more people staying indoors during winter months, flu infection rates increase. The same can be said for SAR-COV-2.

Persons aged 12–18 years are eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Currently, data are lacking on real-world vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalization in adolescents.  
  
What is added by this report?  
  
Among hospitalized U.S. patients aged 12–18 years, vaccine effectiveness of 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against COVID-19 hospitalization during June–September 2021, was 93% (95% confidence interval = 83%–97%).  
  
What are the implications for public health practice?

I think sooner or later there won't be a way to spin this other than we either have to come up with a better way to stop infections (vaccines 2.0), or use existing vaccines (boosters) to keep antibody levels sky high.

I think it's not healthy to keep antibodies ""sky high"" all the time to ward against infections. We don't do it with any other disease, because our immune system knows how to make those antibodies. It may be a stopgap solution while we develop better vaccines. 

I have a feeling here that - again - experts have a blind spot. Because SARS and MERS infect almost uniquely the lower respiratory tract, they thought that a vaccine generating enough antibodies there would be enough to stop transmissions. It turns out that SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect the upper respiratory tract too quite efficiently and the protection induced by vaccines is not that great, hence the high viral loads measured by PCRs.

I have come to accept that even when the world gains sufficient immunity to end all COVID rules for good, it will never be 2019 ever again.

Work has changed.  The economy changed.  Our relationships changed.  We enter a new stage in history as we forever leave the 20th century behind and embrace the new, either reluctantly or enthusiasticly so.

The good news?  This isn't it.  The masks, fighting, fatigue, shortages?  These are just the bumpy transition road -- which is longer than we anticipated.  It may be another year.  Another three?  Most the decade?

But we will come out the other side better prepared to live as 21st century tenants.  Not unlike our predecessors did post WW2, when they said goodbye to the 19th and embraced the 20th.

I wish I could give you a horizon to look forward to, but nobody can.  I'm hoping by 2023.  But I'll accept it if it's longer (because we'll have to accept it).

This is not like other vaccines, which are meant to prevent you from getting sick at all, or to kill the virus altogether. This vaccine does neither of those things, it's only meant to *lessen your symptoms* and even if it reduces your chances of getting sick or spreading the virus, it does not stop it, and you can very much still get sick after being vaccinated, even severely so.

Also, generally speaking, natural immunity is preferred because your body builds up an immunity that is *appropriate to your body*. There is concern that this particular vaccine, not being a traditional one (that works with your bodies natural immune response) might be less effective *because it is so targeted*.

Man there is so much to unpack here and so much is unknown to us.  Are you saying that it'll be normal for the US to have lets say 100K cases per day for extended periods of time into the future, year in and year out?  I sure hope you're very very wrong on that.  I don't see how allowing transmission to go completely uncontrolled is a good idea.  Cases equal hospitalizations, deaths, long term implications.  A large number multiplied by fantastic VE is still a significant number.

&gt; because the mortality rate drops.


Mortality is of course lower than prior to vaccines.  But a lot of people getting sick, even with high VE against death, still means a lot of deaths.  Lets assume current mortality rates remain perpetually and we are unable to control cases counts into the future as you're predicting.  This means a metric shit ton of people dying over time.  A curve doesn't have to have high peaks, it's all about area under the curve.

Personally I feel we're coming up on some sort of crossroads in regard to case counts.  We need to see how this Delta wave plays out, but a lot of people with power are now one foot in and one foot out in regard to significance of cases.  Medical advancements not withstanding, a decision will need to be made.

WASHINGTON (AP) — ""U.S. regulators expect to rule Wednesday on authorizing booster doses of the Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccines, a Food and Drug Administration official said at a government meeting.  
The FDA's Doran Fink previewed “some announcements later today,” which were expected to include allowing the mixing and matching of COVID-19 booster doses among the three U.S. manufacturers — Pfizer, Moderna and J&amp;J. Fink appeared at a meeting of vaccine experts convened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who are expected to take up the FDA decisions and make their own recommendations on Thursday.  
Several million Americans already have gotten a third shot to boost Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine.  
Last week, the FDA's panel of independent experts unanimously recommended broadening the booster campaign to include recipients of the two-dose Moderna vaccine and J&amp;J's one-shot vaccine. Most experts also agreed that using a different booster brand appeared safe and effective for revving up protection. The FDA is not required to follow the group's advice, though it generally does.  
“FDA has been very busy since last Friday wrapping up our review and working toward authorization” of the vaccine applications, said Fink, a deputy director in the FDA’s vaccine division.  
The booster recommendations won't become official until after the CDC's director affirms who should get them and when.""

Vaccines tend to mitigate the peak, but only a bit. With vaccines preventing ~60% of infections, were still going to see up to like 40% of the vaccinated get infected sooner or later + nearly 100% of the unvaccinated.

There is only so much what we can do against it. Locking down and distancing will only slow the spread, but it is inevitable at this point that this thing will go around for ever.

Their deaths used to average like 1,200 7DA with similar case rates and for the past 3 or so months its been much lower with the 7DA being at its highest point in September at 143 7DA.

In August I went on a girls trip with 5 girls staying in the same Airbnb, sleeping in 2 rooms. We are all healthy, active, thin, mid-late 20s. 

2 of us are vaccinated 
2 of us have natural immunity from previous COVID 
1 girl unvaccinated, never had COVID 

We did normal tourist activities each day. By Day 3, the unvaxxed/never-COVID girl was SICK af. She got progressively worse until she could barely walk 10 feet without struggling for breath. (She is also the most fit of all of us and is a health freak, eats all her veggies daily, drinks green juice, etc). 

Low and behold, she had COVID. The rest of us were freaking out despite being vaxxed and having previous infection. 

We still stayed in the same Airbnb with her for the remainder of trip (but let her have her own room instead of sharing). 

We all tested and re-tested for covid and none of us ever got sick. We were totally fine. She ended up staying in the Airbnb for another 2 weeks until she tested negative. (She didn’t want to travel sick). 

The rest of us stayed a few more days to make sure and we never got sick either. Our vaccines and previous infection clearly worked and our immune systems were prepared. 

So that’s my anecdote and why I made the conclusion that your healthy friend must not have a great immune system if she was vaxxed + previous infection.

190 million Americans have received the covid vaccine. Serious side effects are *astonishingly* rare.

On the other hand, the World Health Organization estimates that [between 10% and 20%](https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2021/10/06/default-calendar/expanding-our-understanding-of-post-covid-19-condition-web-series-rehabilitation-care) of people who are infected with covid will experience persistent symptoms ""irrespective of initial disease severity"" -- what people informally call ""long-covid"".

It's OK to be anxious about the vaccine. It's OK to be anxious about the risk of side effects, even if they're incredibly rare and unlikely to happen to you. But you need to recognize that you're not choosing between a scary thing and a safe thing -- you're choosing between a very slightly scary thing (the risk of covid vaccine side effects) and a much, much scarier thing (the risk of getting covid, and either ending up in hospital, or having persistent, potentially life-altering symptoms).

&gt;While the disproportionate impact of this pandemic on men has already been recorded, this study released Tuesday uses the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to quantify that gap, which it said was most pronounced among middle-aged adults. It finds that, while age remains the main risk factor for covid-19 mortality, the gender gap is important and caused by “a combination of factors, which may differ by race, class, geography and other variables.”

&gt;Men overall were 1.6 times likelier to die of the disease caused by the coronavirus than women, the study said. Since March however, when vaccination became widespread in the United States, the gap in deaths between men and women has narrowed in some age groups, it said. The CDC recorded 362,187 male deaths and 296,567 female deaths between Feb. 2020 and end of August this year.

&gt;Race was an important risk factor, with the study authors citing a previous finding that “Black and Hispanic or Latino death rates are six times higher than those for white people.”

&gt;They call on policymakers to focus on inoculating “the most vulnerable groups,” including “men, and especially Black men” — a recommendation that is not without its challenges, given socio-economic factors including barriers to health care access for many people of color.

Sometimes using actual numbers is more useful, because percentages can be misleading. An increase from 1 to 8 is an 800% increase, but isn't something to worry about. 

In this case, the hospitalisation 7 day rolling figure for the UK started at 109.9 on the 1st, and ended at 126.9 on the 31st, and varied around that level, never dipping below 100, for the duration of the month. Numbers taken from the UK Gov dashboard. 

The latest 7 day average for hospitalisation is 848.1. You're correct about this being an \~800% increase, but it isn't an increase to a level of ""oh my god, red alert, we're about to collapse"". And given that the 7 day average has been hovering around this sort of level (with blips up and down) since mid July, there's no reason to think its going to suddenly explode higher. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This time last year there was no vaccine. So you're doing just as poorly as you were totally unvaccinated.

Secondly, this was a recall election during an off year.  Both of these types of elections usually don't have high turnout.  

Thirdly, most voters weren't aware of the recall election until a few weeks before the actual election.

Fourthly, the way the ballot was set up was a little confusing.  There were two questions ""Shall the governor be recalled?  Yes/No""  ""If the governor is recalled who shall replace him?"" 

To retain the governor you need to vote ""No"" but then what do you do about the second question?  Gov. Newsom wasn't in the field of replacement candidates. Would voting for a replacement candidate supersede your ""No"" vote?  That wasn't the case but I and many others didn't know that at first.  

It can break down into three scenarios, vote ""Yes"" pick a candidate, vote ""No"" pick a candidate and the ""No"" vote still counts, vote ""No"" and don't pick a candidate.

I read that Taiwan has slightly more covid deaths from the vaccine than covid since well COVID barely spread there with only around 16000 documented cases total while somewhere around 22 million jabs.   Not sure if the cases were pre or post vaccination but it appears mostly prevaccination.

If you take these numbers it would make around 1300 jabs riskier than a covid case (likely worse than this for youngsters).  

I mean even with the few restrictions of USA's covid prevention only around 1 in 8 have got COVID over 2 years (the amount of time 4 covid boosters would cover).  To do 33 times better than the USA in preventing the spread of covid is not unrealistic especially since such measures work with an order of magnitude.

&gt; * Wear a mask indoors in public if they are in an area of substantial or high transmission.
&gt;   * Fully vaccinated people might choose to mask regardless of the level of community transmission, particularly if they or someone in their household is immunocompromised or at increased risk for severe disease, or if someone in their household is unvaccinated.
&gt; * Get tested if experiencing COVID-19 symptoms.
&gt; * Get tested 5-7 days after close contact with someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
&gt; * Wear a mask indoors in public for 14 days after exposure or until a negative test result.
&gt; * Isolate if they have tested positive for COVID-19 in the prior 10 days or are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms.

It sounds to me that the CDC recommendation for your situation is (1) wait until 5-7 days after your close contact to get a test (I think there's a concern of a false negative if you test too soon) and (2) they do not recommend isolating while waiting for results, just wearing a mask... which they already recommend for everyone because (almost?) everyone is ""[in an area of substantial or high transmission](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view)"" right now.",,,,1634758872,{},hhegeg3,False,t3_qbuz03,False,True,t1_hhdxxjd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qbuz03/daily_discussion_thread_october_20_2021/hhegeg3/,1634897036.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This statement is at best a HUGE over-simplification of the actual picture. Most people stating natural immunity point to this [pre-print paper from Israel](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1) touting that previously infected are less likely to encounter a reinfection than the vaccinated. Overall the paper is decent but it has a few NOTABLE issues that almost certainly impacted the results (reducing the numbers of reinfections):

1. While they attempted to standardize for age, health factors, sex, etc. there are still notable problems with the cohorts. For example, people that die from their first infection (such as the immunocompromised) are often those the most likely to experience a breakthrough infection with a vaccine. This selection-bias of the populations studied inherently biases against the vaccinated group when it comes to breakthrough infections. 

2. Anyone who was vaccinated at ANY point in the study were dropped from the trial cohorts. This is a notable issue because it reduces the number of infections in the unvaccinated cohort. For example, someone who got infected twice and changed their mind about vaccination are no longer are counted.

3. Most importantly, the likelihood to get tested (and as a result get counted as a positive) when showing symptoms is significantly higher amongst those who get vaccinated. Those who have already had it are seldom likely to get tested again.

Quite simply, more controlled studies (such as this one:[Nature, October 14, 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01548-7)) which utilize mandatory periodic COVID testing on large cohorts show ""The effectiveness of two doses remains **at least** as great as protection afforded by prior natural infection.""",,,,1634758442,{},hhefawo,False,t3_qbuz03,False,True,t1_hhdz1qg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qbuz03/daily_discussion_thread_october_20_2021/hhefawo/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,2409d7a11ab5451b221fdd6f7681bdc5e174920d,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1634758460.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

People don't get the proper time to quarantine, and if you're roommates with another associate who has Covid, you still have to come in as long as long as their records show you didn't work the same shift. 

Managers leave employees to check their own temperatures so there's no accountability if someone decides to work with a fever. 

My gf had to quit In-N-Out this year because going in every day felt like you were gambling with your life. One of her co-workers was caughing up a storm while assembling burgers and she notified management but they couldn't be bothered to do anything about it. He tested positive the next day and was back in the stands one week later laughing his ass off about how he had Covid. 

I don't understand how one could possibly work in making food for other people and deny the vaccine. They're risking hundreds of people's lives every day while thinking masks are a fucking joke.  

Corporate never took covid seriously. And it took great effort to be able to talk to HR just for them to make a note and do nothing about it. They won't even tell you who exposed you so you can do your own contact tracing. 

I would definitely avoid In-N-Out while they have this position on masks and vaccines. It's not safe and it's honestly cruel how they've been treating their associates during this pandemic. They honestly don't care who they're compromising unless it hurts their numbers. 

**Bonus Content** Every year In-N-Out gives their employees a Christmas present. Last year, they decided to give them all In-N-Out themed airpod cases, but no airpods.

I'm in the Bay Area and go to San Francisco often.  Yes, you can get a QR code for your phone, (I use Apple Wallet), but you can also show a photo of your card, photocopy or the original card (all of which are incredibly easy to forge/photoshop).

For some situations, you'd be taking a high risk of getting caught (like schools, large companies, etc...), since the card (or replication) has the location, date, and batch number.  If these aren't valid, or if numbers start showing up in a system exceeding actual values, they could be tracked down.

Also, borrowing someone else's won't work where ID is also required.

However, for ""entry"" purposes to a restaurant or venue, it's really just a flash whatever and you're free to go in.

So to some degree, it's just safety theater.  I'm just guessing, not even anecdotally, but it seems to me that they are going to catch a lot of people unprepared to show something fake and turn others away who don't want to support a business requiring proof.

This is why I think it's effective.  Sure, in some places you're going to have a few people getting through, but you're still filtering a much larger number.  I think this works even more so for a city like San Francisco which has a high rate of tourism and a larger regional area of people who have options to go elsewhere if ""they don't want to hassle with vaccine requirements"".",,,,1634762891,{},hheqmt6,False,t3_qc0r89,False,False,t1_hhee1ke,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qc0r89/innout_burger_clashes_with_san_francisco_over/hheqmt6/,1634902372.0,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So I totally disagree with the whole ""enlightened centrist"" approach, and the idea that covid vaccines is something you can just be ""hands-off"" about.

I do agree with the concept that we shouldn't be putting the ""vaccine police"" responsibility onto low-wage workers and service workers. Especially when the *actual* police, who's job it is to enforce laws and ordinances, largely refuse to enforce vaccine mandates or even comply with them.

So then society passes that responsibility to somebody working at a burger place, or a grocery store, who doesn't make enough to deal with it, who has no security backup, and who are frequently accosted, or assaulted, and occasionally hurt or killed for doing their job. People have been shot over this, and killed.

So In-N-Out taking this two-face low key anti-vaxx approach is shitty, but it is true that service workers aren't paid enough to deal with shit like this, and it's not their responsibility to be the vaccination police and get hurt in the process.
