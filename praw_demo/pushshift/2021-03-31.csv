if anything other than the ones on the list get ""popular"" we could have a bad flu season.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/lot-release/influenza-vaccine-2020-2021-season](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/lot-release/influenza-vaccine-2020-2021-season)

The committee recommended that the quadrivalent formulation of egg-based influenza vaccines for the U.S. 2020-2021 influenza season contain the following:

* an A/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus;
* an A/HongKong/2671/2019 (H3N2)-like virus;
* a B/Washington/02/2019- like virus (B/Victoria lineage);
* a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata lineage).

&amp;#x200B;

we could be in for a bad flu season since we didn't have one this year.

hard to guess what's coming.

&amp;#x200B;

**This year's flu season was virtually nonexistent. That could be bad news for next year.**

You don't want to protect us by getting yourself vaccinated? Then excuse my French, but you can take a hike. Can't interact in society? Then we don't want you. Consider yourself exiled.

&gt; You're trying to argue that the government should be able to restrict what someone does and where they go based on some digital document

The government isn't restricting anyone. The passport will almost certainly give businesses the data, upon which they can make decisions about what customers to allow in.

Per a Biden administration senior advisor:

&gt; ""Unlike other parts of the world, the government here is not viewing its role as the place to create a passport, nor a place to hold the data of citizens,"" Slavitt said during a March 29 press briefing. ""We view this as something that the private sector is doing and will do.""

https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/mar/31/how-vaccine-passports-might-work-us/

&gt; Explain to me how that is not an extremely slippery slope toward the social credit scores Chinese people have to deal with?

China doesn't have social credit scores, not really (they do have a name and shame list of people who have lawsuit judgments against them). Western media keeps reporting on this idea, but I'm dating a Chinese girl (and have been for 4-5 years). I have learned a non-trivial amount of Chinese (我可以说一点点中文), I have been to China. I keep asking Chinese people about social credit scores (because I keep seeing articles about it all the time) - both when I was in China and Chinese people who are living in the US, and literally nobody even knows wtf I am talking about.

There's certainly surveillance in China (I've done tests on censorship in WeChat, the main Chinese chat app, and they will just make sensitive messages invisible based on keywords, for the most part), and a fuckton of cameras everywhere, but social credit scores are a fake idea. Maybe the Chinese government will go in that direction eventually, but if you're envisioning some Black Mirroresque app that everybody rates everybody with or which the government gives you a score - it doesn't exist.

&gt; Second of all, who the fuck are you protecting by banning vaccinated people from society?

Er what? I intend to exclude **un**vaccinated people from society.

&gt; Do you understand that if we do that, unvaccinated people will be forced to only interact with other unvaccinated people?

I mean you would still be able to see unvaccinated people as a vaccinated person, or vice versa if you wanted to, it would literally just be a business thing.

- Quarantine compensation money.
- Forbidding activities which drive R disproportionally.
- Mandatory rapid tests, when they can be mass produced.

The other thing people overlook is the MRNA vaccines requires storage at a much, much lower temperature than the AZ ones. Logistically this makes them harder to deploy in third world countries. Combined with the cheaper cost and easier storage requirements, the AZ vaccine is a noble effort to provide protection for less well healed nations.

Whatever is going on with the clotting, the risk of Covid infection to health is much greater.

Recent studies have provided insights into the pathology and immune response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1–8. However, thorough interrogation of the interplay between infected cells and the immune system at sites of infection is lacking. We use high parameter imaging mass cytometry9 targeting the expression of 36 proteins, to investigate at single cell resolution, the cellular composition and spatial architecture of human acute lung injury including SARS-CoV-2. This spatially resolved, single-cell data unravels the disordered structure of the infected and injured lung alongside the distribution of extensive immune infiltration. Neutrophil and macrophage infiltration are hallmarks of bacterial pneumonia and COVID-19, respectively. We provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infects predominantly alveolar epithelial cells and induces a localized hyper-inflammatory cell state associated with lung damage. By leveraging the temporal range of COVID-19 severe fatal disease in relation to the time of symptom onset, we observe increased macrophage extravasation, mesenchymal cells, and fibroblasts abundance concomitant with increased proximity between these cell types as the disease progresses, possibly as an attempt to repair the damaged lung tissue. This spatially resolved single-cell data allowed us to develop a biologically interpretable landscape of lung pathology from a structural, immunological and clinical standpoint. This spatial single-cell landscape enabled the pathophysiological characterization of the human lung from its macroscopic presentation to the single-cell, providing an important basis for the understanding of COVID-19, and lung pathology in general",,,1617304544,{},gt2anyg,True,t3_mi2omy,False,True,t3_mi2omy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mi2omy/the_spatial_landscape_of_lung_pathology_during/gt2anyg/,1617306908,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

If 100 of the unvaccinated are found to contract the virus (or become hospitalized, or whatever is being tested for) while only 10 of the vaccinated do, the vaccine would be considered to have 90% efficacy (against the tested outcome).

Japan and South Korea have succeeded at keeping transmission at a low and steady level, but I don’t think any country has had a severe and widespread outbreak, contained it, and kept the virus under control until vaccination. Many people have often thought that would be the case though, such as in Europe last summer and then in India until recently.

The lesson we can learn from the successful countries is you need to keep a virus OUT or act as quickly as possible if it does get in rather than let it spread widely within your borders and hope to control it later like the US and Europe did.

While the virus would provide a more ""well rounded"" response, there is no reason to think yet that that response will be necessary since the vaccine induced response is enough to prevent against infection. In addition based on the new CDC data, people that were vaccinated were protected from infection not just symptoms meaning the virus was cleared by antibodies before any true activation of the immune response. This is the best case for vaccines but it means there is no additional response to the complete virus.

There's no reason to think that you would have a more severe illness after serum antibodies wane, and it would likely be the opposite. Even after serum titers drop some of your memory cells should remain to respond rapidly after infection and limit viral replication

Does that also mean that people who are presently completely naive to SARS-CoV-2 and are just receiving a vaccine will likely be setting themselves up for a bout of more severe illness if they encounter the virus a long while after their antibody titers are below a certain level?

15 million doses contaminated (article initially stated ""ruined""), several weeks ago, and was undiscovered for ""days"".  This means that the problem was probably known over a month ago.

* The investigation ""delayed the authorization of that plant’s production lines"". This is needed in order to ship vaccines made from that plant.
* ""In a statement late Wednesday, the company said it expected \[...\] to deliver 24 million doses by the end of April \[...\]. But that depends on whether Johnson &amp; Johnson satisfies Food and Drug Administration regulators.""
* From the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/bc05beba-ef13-4db6-8bb0-ffc4ed94df29) (Paywall): ""\[T\]he company said it still expected to deliver 100m doses for use in the US during the first half of the year, and that it aimed to hit that target by the end of May.""

Reading this, it seems that the recent projections were based upon knowledge of this contamination, and that if FDA approval is given, J&amp;J still expects to be able to ship 24 million doses in April and another 50 million or so by around the end of May.

I'll note that the NY Times report suggests it's not entirely J&amp;J's fault.

Showing that even if you are unlucky and get symptoms these vaccines should still save your life and mean a much more mild case of covid than without the vaccine. And ultimately thats the key bit here. Vaccines isn't just about stopping you from getting covid but also meaning even if you do get it it's hopefully alot milder.

Pfizer has also been out several months now and given t9 far more people hence we will be getting alot of real world data about it. Be patient but soon enough once J&amp;J is used more across the world and the US we'll have good real world data coming out about J&amp;J soon enough

So you can have a virus or pathogen replicating in the body and spreading, but that person will not get sick because they have the vaccine.

'Just when you've solved one obstacle, another pops up.' A look behind the scenes of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, with two key Belgian figures.

'The biggest challenge? Scaling up our production at lightning speed. Before the pandemic, no mRNA vaccine had ever been made on an industrial scale.'

In an exclusive briefing by the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer for seven domestic and foreign journalists, Luc Van Steenwinkel, the managing director of the production and packaging site in Puurs, gives more details about the production of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

The essentials
Pfizer produces 100 million corona vaccines per month in Puurs-Sint-Amands.
One dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has 280 components, from 86 suppliers in 19 countries.
European export controls mean an additional administrative burden.
'We got our first call in March 2020 and shipped our first vaccines on December 23, a record pace. To do that, we had to scale up the lines for filling the vaccine vials and set up a 'freezer farm' in the summer to store the vaccines at -80 degrees Celsius. At the same time, our suppliers had to increase their capacity too.'

In order to get the raw materials to Puurs, a widely branched chain was set up, in which components were supplied from other Pfizer sites - the group has more than 40 worldwide - and from external companies.

You can see bottlenecks in the supply of glass for the production of vaccine vials, but also in the raw materials.

LUC VAN STEENWINKEL
MANAGING DIRECTOR PFIZER PURES
'That chain is particularly complex,' says Belgian Danny Hendrikse, vice president of global supply at Pfizer. 'The components come not only from Europe, but from all over the world.' One dose requires 280, which come from 86 suppliers in 19 countries.

For example, lipids, a crucial raw material of the mRNA vaccine, are made at the chemical company Croda International in Yorkshire, England, among other places. These minuscule 'fat globules' wrap the RNA, the unstable genetic material of a piece of the coronavirus that forms the basis of the vaccine.

In Puurs, the mRNA material, supplied from US Pfizer sites in Chesterfield and Andover and BioNTech facilities, is wrapped with those lipids. The final vaccines are filled into glass vials, which are automatically and manually checked for defects, such as cracks. Until they go out the door, the vials are kept packed in special freezers. In total, more than 40 quality controls are carried out.   

In practice, bottle necks pop up regularly, according to Van Steenwinkel. The entire pharmaceutical industry is under pressure. Because billions of doses of corona vaccines are needed worldwide. You see bottlenecks in the supply of glass for the production of vaccine vials, but also in the raw materials.

'European export controls are an additional administrative burden, because we have to get approval for every shipment.

DANNY HENDRIKSE
VICE PRESIDENT GLOBAL SUPPLY PFIZER

'Just when you've solved one obstacle, another pops up. But so far we can manage everything. If there's a problem with a supplier, we can deal with it, just because we have alternatives in our network.'

Production cycle accelerated considerably
Pfizer managed to shorten the production cycle - from mRNA production to shipping - from 110 days, which was already very fast, to 60.

At the same time, Hendrikse points out that European export controls on vaccines do not make things easier. 'It is an additional administrative burden, because we have to get an export approval for every shipment. But our deliveries are not compromised.'

So far, 232 million vaccine doses have left for 84 countries worldwide. We now produce 100 million vaccines per month in Puurs,' says Van Steenwinkel. 'As of May, that will be even more.'

For some background, I work in a hospital full time, qualifying me as healthcare, and I'm 28 with no comorbidities.

I started signing up late February via my county, my work, and every wait list I could find.

All the rite aid stores around had the vaccine, but none of them had available appointment times.  It seemed like they overbooked for their boosters, or just didnt have enough staff qualified to give vaccine.  The ones right across the border in ohio had same day appointments, and were popping up in the list it gave me for a michigan resident.

Pfizer started testing the vaccine in children aged between six months and 11 years last week. Other developers, including the Oxford team, are also planning trials involving children.

Half the participants in the trial were given the vaccination and the other half a placebo shot. There were no Covid-19 cases detected in the group who received the vaccine and 18 infections among those who did not.

The vaccine had produced “robust immune responses” and there were no reports of serious side-effects, Pfizer said. At present, the vaccine is approved in the UK for people aged 16 years and over. It is not yet clear whether the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, the independent panel of experts that advises the government on immunisation strategy, will back the vaccination of children, who only rarely fall seriously ill with Covid-19.
Experts have said that more needs to be known about whether the vaccines will prevent people from transmitting the virus.
Professor Saul Faust, director of the NIHR Southampton Clinical Research Facility, who was not involved in the Pfizer trial, said that the results looked “generally encouraging”.

However, he added that more data would be needed on whether the vaccine prevented asymptomatic carriage and therefore transmission of the virus.
These factors would be important to weigh when considering whether teenagers and children should be vaccinated, he said, because the main rationale would probably be to prevent the disease from spreading to vulnerable adults.
Data from the Office for National Statistics shows that Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificates of nine children last year.

“We are a global manufacturing company with a very sophisticated global supply chain . . . Every one of those suppliers is important to our supply chain and every one of them plays a role,” a spokeswoman for Pfizer said.
Yesterday the EU’s medical regulator said there was no evidence to support the decision of several member states, including Germany and France, to stop using the AstraZeneca vaccine on younger adults because of concerns about a rare blood disease.

European leaders backed down from threats to block vaccine exports to the UK last week but also demanded that AstraZeneca increase supplies to Europe. Thierry Breton, the internal market commissioner, said yesterday that “zero” jabs would be shipped across the Channel if AstraZeneca failed to meet its commitments to the bloc.
Daily second doses of vaccine in Britain have outnumbered first doses for the first time. A total of 270,526 second doses were registered on March 30, compared with 224,590 first doses.

New trial data suggests that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is safe and offers strong levels of protection against Covid-19 in children as young as 12, potentially setting the stage for adolescents to be immunised later this year.
In a trial that involved about 2,250 children in the United States aged between 12 and 15 the jab was entirely effective in preventing symptoms of Covid-19.
Albert Bourla, the Pfizer chairman and chief executive, said that having the vaccine approved for use for children was a matter of “urgency”.
He added: “We plan to submit these data to [the US medical regulator] as a proposed amendment to our emergency use authorisation in the coming weeks and to other regulators around the world, with the hope of starting to vaccinate this age group before the start of the next school year.”",,,1617277767,{},gt0sey4,True,t3_mhtkuw,False,True,t1_gt0seij,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mhtkuw/pfizer_accuses_brussels_of_holding_back_covid/gt0sey4/,1617277778,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

EU export controls have become a burden for Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine production, the drugmaker has said.
The free movement of goods across borders is “absolutely critical” to the operation of its plant in Belgium, which supplies Britain and more than 70 other countries with jabs, the US company said.
Danny Hendrikse, its vice-president for global supply, said that regulations introduced in February put new pressures on the supply chain. The company is now required to notify the Belgian government in advance about every parcel of vaccines it plans to export. Approval must then be granted by the European Commission.

“It has caused a significant administrative burden and some uncertainty,” he said. “Ultimately what we would like our colleagues to do is to focus on making and distributing the vaccine.”
Pfizer explained yesterday that its vaccine, which it developed in partnership with Germany’s Biontech, requires some 280 components which are sourced from 86 suppliers in 19 countries, including Britain.

Increasing the number of suppliers has been key to dramatically increasing production levels at its plant in Puurs in Belgium, where the batch sizes of vaccine have doubled. The time it takes to make the vaccine has been cut nearly in half, from 110 days to 60.

Here are some quotes from that

&gt; Angela Merkel is starting to crack under the pressure of Germany's faltering coronavirus vaccine program. With the chancellor under fire publicly for a lack of Covid-19 shots and her strategy of delegating responsibility to the European Union looking misguided, she snapped when pressed for answers by German state premiers

&gt; Getting angrier than those involved had ever seen, she threatened to retaliate and make the officials’ mistakes public, shocking the participants into silence. On other occasions, she’s come close to tears in public in recent weeks**

&gt; When asked recently whether she would be willing to apologize for the missteps, she deflected and instead responded with a lecture about the complex production process, including the role of saline solution.

Please look at those paragraphs slowly and think if you simply would expect to see this type of writing in Reuters?

“But Andrew Pollard, the head of the Oxford Vaccine Group and chief investigator into the trial of this vaccine, said that extending the gap between vaccines made biological sense. “Generally, a longer gap between vaccine doses leads to a better immune response, with the second dose causing a better boost. (With HPV vaccine for girls, for example, the gap is a year and gives better responses than a one month gap.) From the Oxford vaccine trials, there is 70% protection after the first dose up to the second dose, and the immune response was about three times greater after the second dose when the second dose was delayed, comparing second dose after four weeks versus second dose after 2-3 months,” he told The BMJ, referring to the MHRA’s summary of product characteristics.11

“With the Pfizer vaccine, there are no published data comparing shorter and longer gaps between doses because all participants had the second dose at 3-4 weeks. However, the biology is straightforward and will be the same as with all vaccines . . . The immune system remembers the first dose and will respond whether the later dose is at three weeks or three months.”

In a statement the British Society for Immunology said, “Most immunologists would agree that delaying a second ‘booster’ dose of a protein antigen vaccine (such as the two approved covid-19 vaccines) by eight weeks would be unlikely to have a negative effect on the overall immune response post-boost. We also would not expect any specific safety issues to arise for the individual due to delaying the second dose, other than an increased potential risk of disease during the extended period due to lowered protection.”

It also says:

A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care for England said, “As agreed by all four UK chief medical officers and the medical experts at the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, the data provided by the manufacturers demonstrated that both vaccines offer considerable protection for patients after the first dose.

“This measure will have the greatest impact on reducing mortality, severe disease, and hospitalisations, helping to protect the NHS and save lives.”

Honestly, I think it was a very well-calculated decision to maximise protection and currently the data shows they were right.

Maybe.  But I also think it's true that this whole pandemic and the response to it, from the very beginning, has been one giant human experiment running in real time that we're all trying to figure out as we go - including ""governments and experts"".

We're talking about a brand new virus nobody has ever seen before and new vaccines that have never been used in humans before.  I understand we all want instant, perfect information - but we just don't have it and are instead learning as we go.

Why won't somebody like Fauci say ""it's all over""?  Because up until a month or two ago, nobody knew whether getting vaccinated meant that you just won't get sick or if you won't even have transmissible virus.  And you can't just make a statement like that after a handful of reports or studies. These types of statements usually require *years* of scientific study and research.   Is this news so far good? Absolutely!  But making potentially life-or--death statements that impact the behavior of hundreds of millions of people *should* require more evidence than a handful of studies.

As an example of how abnormal this all is w/r/t scientific process, these vaccines aren't even FDA approved yet.  They're only released pursuant to an Emergency Use Authorization.  Full FDA approval for a vaccine can take *decades*.

So yeah, I understand why Fauci doesn't want to say ""it's all over"" based on a handful of early studies.

If that were true we would see significant excess deaths in places that had severe lockdowns, but not severe COVID outbreaks, like Hawaii, vermont, etc. Spoiler: we don’t. 

And no, the deaths weren’t caused by “deaths of despair” like suicides, etc from stay at home orders—another disingenuous talking point.

[The conservative assumption that all pending investigations for March to May (when lockdowns were happening) were suicides yielded an incident rate of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.77-1.03) deaths per 100 000 person-months for 2020 and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.83-1.10) deaths per 100 000 person-months for 2019 (incident rate ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.76-1.15).](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2775359)

MMR requires a series of boosters throughout childhood, with a follow up for teens.  Adults can get a titer done to make sure their immunity has held up, but there's nothing inherently bad about getting a booster if you don't have your vaccine records from childhood.

You are correct that these mutated B cells are a part of auto-immune disorders. Making self-reactive B cells during affinity maturation is usually the easy part. B cell self-tolerance works by checking if the initial B-cell binds to self-protein. Once it mutates, this is no longer keeping B cells in check. However, these B cells need to receive T cell help in the germinal center.  It's possible that their receptor binds to the virus and some other self-protein and so it can still get T cell help by capturing virus. So these can easily be produced in small, insignificant numbers.

What we do not quite understand is why these B cells get expanded to significant numbers later. We know they must be getting some T-cell help outside of the germinal center, and expanding rapidly.  It probably has something to do with self-reactive helper T cells, but how these self-reactive helper T cells slip through the self-tolerance checks in substantial enough numbers is unknown.",,,1617299620,{},gt204la,False,t3_mhg9lf,False,True,t1_gt05s48,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mhg9lf/your_immune_system_evolves_to_fight_coronavirus/gt204la/,1617301481,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

And like... I guess I kind of understand that? Personally I would like everyone to get vaccinated and think it's shitty and selfish not to get vaccinated, but if in some alternate universe I genuinely felt like I was making a health care decision that was best for my own health but other people might disagree with, I would be upset if I was forced to reveal that or if I had activities restricted by it.

As for the remaining people who *do* want to get vaccinated and *also* think this is a huge burden or a major violation of privacy, I kind of suspect a lot of it is just some combination of the actual term ""vaccine passport"" - which evokes some sort of permanent universal ID that can be used to restrict travel and business - and the fact that there isn't *actually* any specific policy proposal on the table so we don't have any indication of the limits of how it would be used or for how long, so some people are worrying that it's going to end up being some sort of government or corporate ID that will become an additional permanent fixture of all our daily activities on top of what already exists.

I think it would help if people talked about this in more concrete terms. If the Knicks required that you either show proof of vaccination (CDC vaccine card or a digital representation) or a negative rapid test result to get into a MSG for a game until COVID case counts fell below some threshold, I think most people who actually get vaccinated wouldn't really be seen as a huge burden by the majority of people who aren't opposed to getting vaccinated, and it could lead to larger indoor events reopening more quickly which would be kind of nice.

It's likely more complicated than just mixing the two and there are probably multiple different companies involved which would make it complicated.

Transmissible viral loads seem to occur on a bell curve with the biggest peak being the day before symptom onset through a number of days after that.  Overall the tests had (if I remember correctly) something under 80 accuracy which kicked them out of contention.   Yet during that peak they were over 80% accurate.  Check Dr. Mina’s appearances on podcasts fir the exact numbers. 

Basically the philosophy is that if you could get the people who are more likely to “go wild” to not go wild for the 5 days it turns a dark color you could nullify a TON of spread.  Also if you are skeptical of the result they are cheap enough where you could take one every 24 hours (or sooner) and that will cut down false negatives.  

Having them on hand would be helpful because they can change behavior without any need to send anything to the government.  I think even the most skeptical people don’t really want to show up somewhere and knowingly spread Covid. 

There are other applications as well. 

This could have been an interesting part of a school opening honor system testing protocol that would probably help ripple out to cutting down community spread.  

Example: Have grade cohorts (example: 8 grade a&amp;b) have a sample pool test on Friday mornings.  Cohort 8b throws a positive pool test... by Saturday they are contacted via automated system.  They have 7 rapid tests on hand ahead of time per student as part of the return plan for schools.   Have them on their own lick the strip every morning.  It’s clear get on the bus.  It’s not stay home no questions asked.  With possibly some incentive for doing so (no clue what carrot to offer here as opposed to a stick).

I know that sounds idealistic but I think it would work in more compliant places like the North East or the Pacific NW.  

Its pretty interesting to think through these things but in reality we have such a hodgepodge of state systems and various philosophical approaches to Covid.",,,1617291463,{},gt1hqlv,False,t3_mhs4cz,False,True,t1_gt1dyl4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mhs4cz/fda_approves_2_rapid_athome_covid_tests/gt1hqlv/,1617292084,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Point I find highly questionable is that these vaccines are still being researched, trials are not finished, anyone who takes it effectively takes part in a trial and to push them onto (or into rather) people is a violation of the Nuremberg Code.

I despise the idea of this kind of class divide. It's worse than a class divide in fact. It's based on people's health. Can't get any more discriminatory than that.  

The vaccines might all be great and safe and all the rest of it but they may well turn out to be the worst agenda humanity ever managed to push. We simply do not know because we do not have the data.

What Mr. Bourla said is completely consistent with my point.

This trial demonstrates that immune response is still very high after 6 months, making it more likely that it will be good or adequate at 12 months.

The complaints from people who have had appointments there recently say that none of the staff are wearing them, but I did assume that for certain procedures they still did.  Maybe not, though.

The sad thing is that the main dentist retired right before covid and his protégé took the practice over.  4 generations of my family have gone to the guy who retired and he was a very careful, very nice dentist.  It was very cool for my son to go to the same dentist that his great-grandma went to when she was alive.   
 But, sadly, apparently the protégé could care less about patients now that he's no longer answerable to a boss.

Since dentistry requires an unmasked patient and drilling creates a significant amount of aerosols, dentists of all people need to be taking this extremely seriously.

For example:

"" They found that using air turbine drill types, which are the most common type of dental drill, creates dense clouds of aerosol droplets that spread as fast as 12 metres per second and can quickly contaminate an entire treatment room. Just one milliliter of saliva from infected patients contains up to 120 million copies of the virus, each having the capacity to infect. ""

He has to know that.  He can't have missed that his profession needs to be particularly careful, right?  He is vocally uber conservative, which has never been an issue before, but I guess that's how the world is now... you have to wonder whether your medical professional's political views are going to compromise your care.

It's a numbers game.

When you're exposed, you get only a tiny fraction of viruses on/in you compared to what the sick person has. A sick person might have a billion virus particles in/on/around them (all numbers are invented for illustrative purposes), and after contact, you might end up with 0.001% of their viruses, so immediately after exposure you have acquired 10,000 virus particles. Viruses are really dumb, so most of those virus particles will just sort of end up in useless places until they ""die"", but some percentage will end up being able to get into your cells and then multiply, making something like thousands or millions of copies for each cell they infect. At that point your immune system notices and starts killing them, and it *is* generally pretty effective at killing viruses, but there's just so many of the damn things that it takes a while (e.g. 2 weeks), and if there are enough viruses, you show symptoms.

So let's take 2 scenarios of where Alice (who's sick) contacts Bob, and then Bob contacts Charlie a little while later later.

Scenario 1: Bob isn't vaccinated. Viruses have done a few rounds of reproduction and there are millions of them in his system. Charlie gets 0.001% of Bob's viruses, which means that he gets thousands, enough to take hold and get him sick.

Scenario 2: Bob is vaccinated. The viruses can't get a foothold in Bob's body, so when he contacts Charlie, he still has the same 10,000 virus particles on him that he originally got from Alice. Charlie gets 0.01% of those, that is, a single virus particle, which is overwhelmingly likely to die without taking hold of any cells.",,,1617240403,{},gszcl4k,False,t3_mhcmbn,False,False,t1_gsyxhou,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mhcmbn/data_suggests_vaccinated_individuals_dont_carry/gszcl4k/,1617243719,15,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,True

In Hong Kong where I live, everyone who gets off a plane gets tested in the airport and held until the result comes back. There's quite a few flights coming in each day(but nothing like before of course) and we only nab a handful of cases per day.

The big crux is all those people who are infected but test negative as the virus hasn't inoculated yet. We have some people testing positive on day 19(!!!) of their mandatory arrival quarantine(locked up 21 days baby).

I was just driving through a part of Tennessee over the weekend. I stopped in a gas station and nobody except me was wearing a mask. When I asked the (unmasked) employee at the register whether or not there was a mask mandate, she said there was but that the store didn't enforce it.

I don't know if it's the case with Michigan, but what good are the restrictions if they aren't actually being enforced?",,,1617231877,{},gsywj7k,False,t3_mhcmbn,False,True,t1_gsygrsq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mhcmbn/data_suggests_vaccinated_individuals_dont_carry/gsywj7k/,1617235909,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

So, where in the Constitution or Bill of Rights does it specify Sex Offender registration? It doesn’t. It’s ruled under the double jeopardy ruling. No one can be punished for the same crime twice. First they are convicted and then after conviction, they have to register. That’s being punished twice for the same crime. And some cities make them go door to door telling their immediate neighbors who they are like in California. 

Registration is a public safety issue and the ruling was in context and conjunction to double jeopardy. No where does the Constitution state that a sex offender have to register. The Justices that ruled on it stated that public safety over rules a sex offenders rights. It was brought in front of the Supreme Court, for Constitutionality. 

The point to all of this was about the wisdom of Wisconsin’s Supreme Court striking down the mask mandate. It was clear they didn’t side with wisdom like the sex offender registration laws, which are written by individual states, not the Feds. Wisdom dictates that the public’s safety is of most importance. So where was the wisdom of the court protecting the people? If we can protect children or adults for that matter from offenders, then why can’t lives be protected? That’s the point I’m making.

Which is when everyone has started wearing masks and social distancing.

So if you were social distancing and wearing a mask last year when unvaccinated, you should still be doing those same things right now even if fully vaccinated.

This period begins before you start showing symptoms, once the agent has replicated and infected enough cells.

If you're vaccinated, this virus isn't able to replicate during the incubation period, and then doesn't reach the stage where you actively shed the virus and can spread it.  Or at the very least, it replicates just a tiny bit and doesn't cause enough to infect someone, or greatly reduces the chances (like reduced viral load).

It's possible someone could breath covid on you and all your clothing, then you can go and give an unvaccinated person a hug and then it gets dispersed that way, but I'd have to imagine that's pretty rare.

So eli5, virus needs to replicate inside body to infect person and then get shedded.  If person is vaccinated, the virus can't replicate and can't be spread from person to person.

People need to stop acting like this was recent. It was 50 years ago. 

You should not be forced into a space that is too small just because you aren't rich. Basic comfort is not an unrealistic expectation. 

&gt;When all the seats were not tight or cramped a lot of people would not be able to afford air travel like they do today. Greyhound it was or car.

Again, FIFTY YEARS AGO. Furthermore, they've been making seats narrower and legroom smaller every few years despite fares being accessible to lower-income people. They didn't make fares cheaper when they got rid of being able to choose your seat, they just added another fee. 

&gt;Airlines did find the sliver between not worth it and bearable! It’s also why airlines stopped going bankrupt and out of business like they all have in the past! 

They didn't stop going bankrupt. Why are you throwing out such easily disproven lies?

&gt;Airlines historically have always lost money until very recently....which also coincides with the cheaper no frills airfares that only include the seat and nothing else.

I would like to see some actual proof of this. Show me your evidence that airlines always lost money until those very cheap seat-only tickets became available. 

I look forward to you never addressing this question. 

&gt;..and what has happened to the number of people traveling in the United States and world wide? They’ve increased to the highest levels ever. Air travel has never been more accessible to everyone worldwide than it currently is....

Post hoc ergo propter hoc is not a valid argument. 

&gt;aka they gave the passengers (customers) what they wanted and everyone could afford.

No, they didn't. They gave people the most expensive possible fare before people would say ""this is not worth the price"". 

&gt;Why are you making the “absurd” assumption I meant lie flat seats.......premiums seats now are what you’d consider standard size seats.... you pay extra for them.

You said first class. First class seats lie flat. 

I am aware you pay extra for them. Why do you keep repeating obvious shit as though it's new information? Oh, right, because you're trying to make me sound uninformed and stupid. 

Premium seats are NOT what I'd consider standard size seats, stop lying about my argument. 

&gt;I’m honestly interested in what airline you as a 5’5” person were having leg issues... I’m 5’8” and never had an issue flying coach....I’ve also never flown a budget or ultra low cost carrier...please answer this one.

Oh wow I have an experience that is different from yours, I must be a lazy, dumb poor person. 

Jackass. 

Delta offers the only non-stop flight from where I currently live to where most of my family lives, so I've primarily flown Delta the past 5 years. About 40% in steerage, 40% in steerage with a tiny smidge extra leg room, 10% in business class.

The steerage with slightly more leg room is bearable for leg room but still too narrow. 

Business class is phenomenal but is far past what I'd like to see in coach. 

Other than Delta I fly Jet Blue whenever possible, primarily because they have slightly more legroom. 

Other than that it's whoever is cheapest and has the fewest layovers. 

I have never flown on Spirit or any of the other budget airlines. 

&gt;Yes, you are right. Airlines charge for every little thing because it gives the customer the choice of what they want to pay for and what they don’t.....

Bull shit. It gives them the opportunity to charge EXTRA fees for things that you're already paying for. They didn't drop prices when they decided to charge extra for picking seats. 

&gt;....this is what has made air travel cheaper and more accessible than ever before. Airlines wouldn’t eat the cost of these amenities before they would just include them in all the seat prices and everyone would pay for these things. Even if the used/wanted/enjoyed them or not.

Stop lying. 

The thing that made air travel cheaper is more efficient aircraft and shoving more seats into the planes. Charging people for the LUXURY of spending $60 to ensure you are seated next to your child is not what drove down the cost of airfare. This is an impossibility as the cost of airfare was declining for decades before that fee was introduced. 

If you weren't lying, every airline would charge for a carry-on and personal item.

If you weren't lying, every airline would actually try to optimize the boarding and de-boarding.

A better community would handle this in a way included people rather than excluding them.  There were multiple other options.   In order of which I’d have employed them:

a) express discontent in that original admin post, give it time to see if the bosses respond.

b) sticky posts about the topic so regular uses are aware

c) go to the media (I think “Reddit protects a pedo supporting employee” was enough of a story (without blackouts) to get media traction and shame them into firing her.)

d) pick a “don’t log on to Reddit day”, encourage users to participate (but let it be voluntary.

e) quit in protest

I don’t think I’d have ever shut down a sub in protest.  I wouldn’t feel like I have any right to do that. I’m not a fan of any kind of protest that negatively impacts others.   Peaceful marches along organised routes, definite yes.   Impacting others (e.g., by chaining yourself to stuff), no.

The antibodies that the vaccine create within the human body eventually dwindle and booster shots will be needed.

I had covid-19 in March 2020 and had antibodies after, however the last blood test in January 2021 showed negligible trace antibodies.  Doctors said I, and others that had it early on could contract it again and recommended getting vaccinated which would last another 9-12 months.

Unless herd immunity is done (at a rate that's not possible currently) it will mutate again thus requiring boosters for the future strains.

* [Choice-supportive bias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice-supportive_bias) occurs when people distort their memories of chosen and rejected options to make the chosen options seem more attractive.

* [Prospect theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory) involves the idea that when faced with a decision-making event, an individual is more likely to take on a risk when evaluating potential losses, and are more likely to avoid risks when evaluating potential gains. This can influence one's decision-making depending if the situation entails a threat, or opportunity.

* [Optimism bias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias) is a tendency to overestimate the likelihood of positive events occurring in the future and underestimate the likelihood of negative life events.

&gt;**the vaccine is not associated with an increase in the overall risk of blood clots (thromboembolic events) in those who receive it;**
 
&gt;there is no evidence of a problem related to specific batches of the vaccine or to particular manufacturing sites;
 
&gt;however, the vaccine **may** be associated with very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia, i.e. low levels of blood platelets (elements in the blood that help it to clot) with or without bleeding, including rare cases of clots in the vessels draining blood from the brain (CVST).

&gt;These are rare cases – around 20 million people in the UK and EEA had received the vaccine as of March 16 and EMA had reviewed only 7 cases of blood clots in multiple blood vessels (disseminated intravascular coagulation, DIC) and 18 cases of CVST. **A causal link with the vaccine is not proven**, but is possible and deserves further analysis.

&gt;given the rarity of the events, and the difficulty of establishing baseline incidence since COVID-19 itself is resulting in hospitalisations with thromboembolic complications, the strength of any association is uncertain.

This is written extremely conservatively, such that if by some remote possibility there later turns out to be a link, the EMA won't take any flak for having excluded it. This is normal and to be expected for the EMA to avoid the risk of losing confidence the same way the CDC did over its bold pronouncements around masks and such at the beginning of the pandemic.

It is not necessarily more severe than the other strains, but it has a propensity to spread asymptomatically in such a way as to avoid detection through regular testing, and it relentlessly overpowered the original strain of COVID in SA. 

Unlike most countries currently experiencing cases with different underlying variants, the SA variant retains control in South Africa. IIRC, we have seen only one reported case of each of the UK and Brazilian variants. It presently accounts for about 99% of recorded cases.

[],,Lefty_22,,,[],,,,text,t2_vhjz9,False,False,[],"When people first started talking about virus immunity periods last year, I was the first to be on the bandwagon of saying that the “3 month” immunity was almost certainly permanent. The main “catch” is mutations. For example, if you get and recover from the flu, your body becomes immune to that specific strain and that configuration. However, the flu has many strains and mutates fairly quickly. Therefore, you can get the flu each year or two because the next years flu is probably a different strain or mutation. 

With COVID, it is likely the same. If you recover from sars-COV2, you likely have lifetime immunity to that particular strain. However, different strains may be different from an immune reaction standpoint. We just don’t know yet. However, if the mutation rate of COVID and the extent of those mutations are not significant enough, then it is likely that humans can achieve permanent herd immunity to the current COVID variants in the near future. 

The other factor at play in the “3 month immuity” figure was data limitations. Just like how your medicine only has a 12 month expiry, that doesn’t necessarily mean it actually loses potently, identify, efficacy, etc after 12 months. The 12 months is how long the manufacturer was required to study those parameters. If the manufacturer studied them longer, the expiry would likely be longer. However, drug companies have no incentive to do so. On the contrary, shorter expirations mean you have to buy more drug!

In the context of COVID, the original 3 month immunity figure was therefore limited by the available data. From the data, they could only say with confidence that patients appeared to be immune for at least 3 months. Now that additional data is being published, I imagine that figure will be revised to much longer than 3 months.",,,1617297410,{},gt1uz4b,False,t3_mhg9lf,False,True,t3_mhg9lf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mhg9lf/your_immune_system_evolves_to_fight_coronavirus/gt1uz4b/,1617298882,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Two points you could make one in either direction.

2) Many of the people who died of covid-19 had severe heart disease and cancer both of which frequently give people very low survivals.

[],,mrcatboy,,,[],,,,text,t2_n06ju,False,False,[],"When we say that a vaccine ""works,"" we're actually talking about two different but related ways the immune system can defend against pathogens.

The first and most fundamental result is teaching the immune system to recognize a pathogen as foreign, so our immune cells can more rapidly mobilize a defense against it.

The second result that builds on top of this immunological training is developing **neutralizing antibodies**... molecules that float around in your bloodstream constantly and will bind to the pathogen and prevent it from infecting your cells at all.

The former is like having a trained military to fight off an enemy in case a war starts.  The latter is like having your trained military develop and operate a missile defense system to take out any ICBMs or enemy warplanes before they can bomb your cities.

While both aspects of this defense strategy are important, the latter is a front-line defense that prevents any damage from happening whatsoever.  The former is having a more mainline defense that will end the war sooner to minimize the damage that will occur.

The vaccine for the wild type (original) covid virus was engineered to help the body develop both immunological training as well as neutralizing antibodies.  The thing is, neutralizing antibodies can't adapt to new strains that are too different, while immune cells that have been trained to recognize covid can.  A new covid strain that neturalizing antibodies can no longer bind to can still make a vaccinated person sick, but since their immune system got a head start in recognizing the original virus, it will be able to mount an immune response days or even weeks faster and reduce the amount of damage that's been done, leading to what should be a much less severe bout of illness.

So vaccine manufacturers are doing what's essentially patch updates to the vaccine which will hopefully train a patient's immune system to develop new and improved neutralizing antibodies as a front-line defense.",,,1617301580,{},gt24cc5,False,t3_mhg9lf,False,True,t1_gt1w5jy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mhg9lf/your_immune_system_evolves_to_fight_coronavirus/gt24cc5/,1617303651,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I'd argue this line of thinking could lead to a very self-centered way of viewing vaccines. Not saying that's how _you_ feel specifically, but ""risk/reward"", ""cost/benefit"", etc. are typically used in situations like when dealing with money or personal endeavors where it only affects the person making the decision or their family, and that's totally fine and good. BUT... vaccines are different. They don't just protect the person receiving the vaccine, but they often also protect the many people that person comes in contact with, especially vulnerable people.

So... for example: to a selfish, healthy, and young person who only thinks about themselves, the ""risk"" of taking the covid vaccine might be a strong, uncomfortable reaction to it at worst. The ""reward"" would be not getting sick with covid, which may or may not be worse than getting infected with actual covid. That risk/reward equation seems kinda bad, maybe even favoring not getting the vaccine.

The above, I'd argue, is of course the wrong way to think about it. The risks, as we all know, are very minimal and a small price to pay for immunity from covid. The rewards, **especially when approached with a collective mindset**, are immense: herd immunity from covid and preventing thousand and thousands more from dying from the disease.

It should be a simple decision to make: get the vaccine, and actually be a part of the solution and help save lives.",,,1617301267,{},gt23oif,False,t3_mhq40z,False,True,t1_gt1mmsw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mhq40z/nursing_students_who_refuse_covid19_vaccine/gt23oif/,1617303309,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Additionally, globally, the UK variant is out competing the SA variant at least 2 to 1 for cases. It should stand to reason if the UK variant was in existence in SA it would automatically become more dominant based on worldwide trends.

Thankfully not many people from other more connected parts of the world even go to Sub Saharan Africa. Doubly so now.

Also, the mRNA vaccines in use in much of the 1st world will be effective against the variant currently circulating in Africa.

The issue I took with your comment is the suggestion that you should ignore the CDC's hesitance to say how long the vaccine will last because it will last forever. Both of those are dangerous statements. You are right, best guess is it will last a reasonably long time, and maybe that could be conveyed more, but perpetuating this idea that the CDC knows and is lying about how long it will last is not true and dangerous. We truly are not certain how long it will last, immunity does not last forever in all cases, and we should act in a cautious manner until we have further data so we don't get surprised and lose immunity if it doesn't turn out like we expect.

[],,DeepIntermission,,,[],,,,text,t2_ravwlwd,False,False,[],"So with the flu, the vaccines they make are mostly based on educated guesses about what will be the predominant subtypes and lineages and they just combine those into one vaccine. With the mRNA platform, I imagine they’ll get better at flu vaccines too. But also with sars-cov-2, there is a LOT more sequencing going on, so we have a better idea of what to do with the vaccine. 

With flu, (to my knowledge) the reason the vaccines aren’t as effective is usually because there’s either a different subtype or wildly different variant with important mutations (sometimes from genetic drift and shift) that make the immune response from a vaccine less effective (since they’re not as accurate for the specific flu that might end up circulating). Like, for example, one year I got the trivalent flu vaccine (2 Flu A subtypes, and 1 flu B lineage) and ended up getting Flu B — I wasn’t even vaccinated against that strain, probably. Or maybe it was the Flu B I was vaccinated against, but it conferred so many important mutations that it didn’t matter, because it couldn’t stop the virus from replicating in my cells. 

Meanwhile, with SARS-CoV-2, pfizer has determined that their vaccine is (as far as I’ve read) equally as effective against the South African variant, and we’re over a year since the start of this thing. So likely, these variants aren’t super meaningful the way they are with flu, since it hasn’t mutated in a way that makes the vaccines we have ineffective. A good reason might be that we haven’t established that any common animal is a massive reservoir the way we have with flu. 

With flu, the virus can go back into animals (say birds; like chickens for example) and recombine, giving it significantly more genetic diversity when it goes to infect its next host — plus a lot more access to a human population (also why most countries surveil their poultry farms, I assume the US does, but I know Asia did when I was there). As it’s likely sars-cov-2 started in bats, and we haven’t seen masses of animals infected as reservoirs with sars-cov-2, it also reduces the chance that we’re going to end up with some vaccine evading variant, because less people interact with bats than say, farm animals.

Within humans, we don't have any scary subtypes/strains of coronaviruses in us constantly circulating (like the way that highly pathogenic avian influenza, for example, can circulate in birds). So then the probability is lower that we would end up with something way off from what we're dealing with currently.

- washing your hands is enough

- masks are useless or even dangerous

- transmission by aerosols is insignificant

- the virus won't mutate

- if it mutates it will become less dangerous

- children don't transmit the virus

- the mutations won't evade vaccines ...

Always lack of scientific evidence to prove the contrary was cited as an excuse for inaction. 

Anybody warning about the danger was denigrated as being alarmist. 

In the end, action always was taken too late. With a virus as contagious as this one a proactive approach is needed and not a reactive approach. Failure to act early imposes a heavy price later, both in human lives and economic cost.

This is why a cautious factor is not the same as an antivaxer. An antivaxer is anti-science and thinks vaccines are bad for you.

The cautious vaxers are cautious because there's a lot of political and financial pressure to get these vaccines out as quickly as possible.  Everything that's manufactured has bugs in version 1.0 and some people just prefer to wait for a version 2.0.

Somehow a federal institution has managed to strike a deal with AstraZeneca to locally manufacture their vaccines, but it won't start until June \~ July.

The reason for this is most likely because on the early days of the pandemic he had an army factory manufacture an absurd amount of chloroquine and declared the pandemic over. Now there's a stock of 15 years worth of chloroquine and there's no way he can explain the expenses.

Worse yet, he's trying to play the people's saviour by doing everything to prevent lockdowns.

No, the quote doesn’t invalidate the title. 

I’m a university professor and having chatted with one of our room sterilization staff by chance just a few hours ago, I have at least a little voice to speak to your question. 

1.	**I know for a fact that several of my students are immune-compromised.** I teach and research in a department that must hold some classes in-person for reasons of kinesthetic &amp; proprioceptive learning (“muscle memory” skills if you like). The stats for transmissibility on COVID skew hard against immune-compromised students surrounded by fellow students.  This is the demo targeted by the post-Spring-Break rise we’re seeing lately.  The IC students through no fault of their own are between a rock and a hard place for these in-person classes. Conclusion: to treat my fellow humans with dignity and the precautionary principle, we’re gonna nuke those rooms virucidally after every single class session.
2.	**Visible sterilizing crews really do reassure students struggling with anxiety, depression, borderline p. disorder, etc.** These young folk are already stretched pretty thin by loans, online class fatigue, eroded earning potential vs. previous generations, etc.  Mental health problems (here in the USA at least with our expensive for-profit medical system) are the real deal.  Distress’s interactions with Covid have meaningful effects on health. Conclusion: even if you believe that virucide application is safety theater, remember that other folks have equally valid and different perspectives on that.
3.	**We can put more students into a paycheck with light work like this, since all other normal campus ops are still underway in our self-contained small city.**  Helping more student workers make ends meet elevates our entire region beyond the direct economic benefit to them. For more information, search on direct vs. indirect economic impact and how many times a dollar circulated through a community before exiting. 
4.	**Perceived limited benefit getting equated to “we shouldn’t do this” runs afoul of a couple reasoning [fallacies](https://www.logicalfallacies.org).** For example, brushing your teeth once very very slightly lowers your risk of dying from an oral abscess secondary to a dead tooth root.  Should we therefore not brush our teeth?  Anyway, take a look through that loins if you like.  It’s a fascinating tour through logic and a lot of fun IMO.

White House officials said that the push for vaccine passports should come from the private sector and that the federal government won’t take the lead in creating a centralized document proving vaccination.

The U.S. government “is not viewing its role as the place to create a passport, nor a place to hold the data of citizens,” Andy Slavitt, a White House Covid-19 adviser, said Monday in a briefing.

The whole thing just seems like a sunk-cost-fallacy nightmare. The fear was that the Fort Dix outbreak was the start of a new 1918-style flu pandemic. The WHO took a watch and wait stance while the US went gung ho. In fact, no deadly pandemic developed. 

At the beginning, technical requirements involving poultry made it desirable to proceed with vaccine production without delay. Fair enough. But the decision to roll it out to the entire population eight months later, when there was clearly no imminent threat from H1N1 anywhere in the world was ... inexplicable. 

As for long term effects, as per the CDC website regarding Guillain-Barré Syndrome:

“ In 1976, there was a small increased risk of GBS after swine flu vaccination, which was a special flu vaccine for a potential pandemic strain of flu virus. The National Academy of Medicine, formerly known as Institute of Medicine, conducted a scientific review of this issue in 2003 and found that people who received the 1976 swine flu vaccine had an increased risk for developing GBS. The increased risk was approximately one additional case of GBS for every 100,000 people who got the swine flu vaccine.”

So it’s not like the vaccinated were dropping like flies. But, apparently, injury was caused. It would have been a drop in the bucket in the face of a clear and present danger, but was that the case? It seems not. 

So, not a good comparison with 2021. But I still think it’s worthwhile to know the history.",,,1617232911,{},gsyyg9z,False,t3_mgeq6m,False,True,t1_gsw3pa4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mgeq6m/covid_vaccine_hesitancy_drops_among_all_americans/gsyyg9z/,1617236859,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Or look to my home state of New York even.  Nearly half the population lives in NYC and the rest is spread out among an area that can take seven or more hours to get to by car.  Putting a percentage goal on the state as a whole could still leave you with a huge discrepancy between cities.

Not all laws are laid out in the Constitution. The Constitution simply lays out the powers of government and the rights of the people upon which the government cannot infringe. The vast majority of our laws cannot be found in the US Constitution. That includes the laws that create the sex offender registry. It also includes the laws that outlaw sex offenses. 

All laws, however, must stand up against judicial review if challenged in a court of law. Ultimately, if a court believes that a law violates the Constitution, it has a legal obligation to strike the law (or the unconstitutional portion of the law) down. A law doesn’t have to be mentioned in the Constitution for it to exist—it just cannot violate the Constitution according to the courts.

Now let’s get back to the sex offender registry. It is purely your opinion that the sex offender registry violates double jeopardy. The courts do not agree. In fact, one of the cases mentioned in my previous link—I think it was the ex post facto challenge—the court ruled that the sex offender registry is not punitive. In the eyes of SCOTUS, it is not viewed as a punishment. You can disagree with that—some of the dissenting justices did—but the court did not rule that it is unconstitutional.

So no, you are completely wrong. The sex offender registry is not an example of the courts throwing out the Constitution because of some vague “wisdom” standard of protecting the public.

I wouldn’t call it moving the goalposts, at most I would say it’s making excuses, but those people aren’t fully wrong. The only truly effective thing to do at this point is to keep vaccinating people to the point that community transmission is affected more, and things will get better. I get the comparison, but the whole moving goalpost thing in terms of restrictions and what we need to get back to normal has been much worse than many think. Like we started out wanting to avoid overloading hospitals. We’ve done that completely. Then over time the idea was to keep it going to “slow the spread” which I guess makes sense but a lot of/most of the measures taken really don’t have as much of an affect as others. Then the idea was to wait until vaccines are available, then the next one that’s sprouting now is to wait until we’ve vaccinated every person who wants one. But the issue is that there haven’t been any concrete pints where an official says “once we meet this realistic measure, we are done with Covid.” There have been a lot of colleges and events saying that they’ll require both vaccination and social distancing, which is the stupidest bullshit I’ve ever heard. There have been a lot of people in general who refuse to believe and/or act like vaccines reduce transmission the way they do, mostly because of the feeling that everyone is always contagious being put into people minds.

There is no evidence of ""sweeping under the rug"" that I'm aware of, but government and corruption are not exactly strangers, and it's naive to think that there isn't billions or trillions of dollars at stake for these vaccines to work and people to accept them.  Also, though this vaccine is highly effective and highly safe, it's not 100% effective nor 100% safe.  The good outweighs the bad, these vaccines are authorized for emergency use (i.e. experimental) and the study isn't even over yet - the clinical trial goes on for another year.  The data looks good ""so far"" and is highly believed to provide way more benefit than harm, so that's why it's been authorized for emergency use.

Again, I'm all for the vaccine, and have already received my first dose.  But I'm not going pressures or criticize someone else for not wanting to do something with their body they don't want to do.

But to say that lockdowns or masks aren’t effective is bullshit. 

As a Michigander, I’d point to how many people didn’t follow the mask mandates to begin with. Our mobility returned back to pre-pandemic numbers within a few months after the start; people may be staying home more but they are not “locking down”.

My daughters school, which she has only attended virtually, has new cases reported like every day. Those people are not locked down.

In-person dining started up again 2/1. Cases went up right after that. Surprised? I got curbside pickup at a place a week ago and looking inside it was full capacity, probably 100+ people, and no one was wearing a mask because they were seated and “eating”.

When all the seats were not tight or cramped a lot of people would not be able to afford air travel like they do today. Greyhound it was or car.

Airlines historically have always lost money until very recently....which also coincides with the cheaper no frills airfares that only include the seat and nothing else...and what has happened to the number of people traveling in the United States and world wide? They’ve increased to the highest levels ever. Air travel has never been more accessible to everyone worldwide than it currently is.....aka they gave the passengers (customers) what they wanted and everyone could afford. 

Why are you making the “absurd” assumption I meant lie flat seats.......premiums seats now are what you’d consider standard size seats.... you pay extra for them. 

I’m honestly interested in what airline you as a 5’5” person were having leg issues... I’m 5’8” and never had an issue flying coach....I’ve also never flown a budget or ultra low cost carrier...please answer this one. 

Yes, you are right. Airlines charge for every little thing because it gives the customer the choice of what they want to pay for and what they don’t.....this is what has made air travel cheaper and more accessible than ever before. Airlines wouldn’t eat the cost of these amenities before they would just include them in all the seat prices and everyone would pay for these things.

The next is the usual “well fuck em then” sentiment.

The one you replied to correctly says that if we leave them to get infected, they can be a vector for new mutations.

You then bring up mink mutation as if that has anything to do with trying to ensure maximum vaccination rates in humans.

Of course this would have no effect on possible mutation rates in other animals. Well, aside from the fact that reducing the spread through humans will also by definition reduce the chances to spread it to animals.

&gt;	I was dealing head on with the idea that unvaccinated people are lepers.

No you weren’t. And the only comment in the above chain that comes anywhere near that sentiment is the third comment - and bringing up potential mutation through anti-vax  populations is in fact a counter-argument to the “well fuck em, let them just get infected.",,,1617248268,{},gszqoe7,False,t3_mhcmbn,False,True,t1_gszprcb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mhcmbn/data_suggests_vaccinated_individuals_dont_carry/gszqoe7/,1617250420,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Whaaat....? Can you please source that one for me? The US isn't supplying most of the vaccines in European Union countries (Pfizer and J&amp;J have been relatively quiet on this per the article above, but I suspect they are keeping supplies mostly domestic until the government gives them the okay). Additionally as well, the EU has been far more heavily reliant on the Astra Zeneca vaccine, which has had more than its fair share of issues and bad press. 

I'm not defending what the US is doing actually, and I do agree they shouldn't stop any doses of vaccine being sent anywhere, but I also think it is fair to be somewhat skeptical as to Russian motivations here. The point above is to say this is an actual drop in the bucket for the vaccines actually on order in Brazil, and the Russians are only publicizing this to make the US out to be the big bad boogie man. 

If you want to criticize the US, you need to be more informed and specific. Let me give you some examples. The US and specifically the Biden administration have refused to take action under previously granted authorities to lift intellectual property protections on the existing vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna foremost, among others). Because they are protected by patents, it's not like some factory in India can just start pumping out the formula to recreate one of these RNA vaccines, such as Pfizer's one. They instead have to be licensed by Pfizer, and it all has to be done by Pfizer; Pfizer can also ask whatever they want in price terms from the receiving countries (such as Brazil). If you are lucky to live in an advanced enough country where your government can afford to pay Pfizer's asking price, then great-- your tax dollars (or insert currency) are being put to work. If not? Too bad-- you are playing by the rules of capitalism as far as the vaccine developing companies are concerned. This is why the world won't be fully vaccinated until sometime late next year or in 2023.

Here are some sources that support this, but not in as direct as a way as I remember reading.

&lt;&lt;A vaccinated person is very likely to get a negative result from a serology test, even if the vaccine was successful and protective. That’s because different serology tests detect antibodies to different parts of the virus.

Some tests detect antibodies to the spike protein of the virus, which are produced in response to viral infection or the vaccine. Others detect antibodies to a different part of the virus called the nucleocapsid protein, which are produced in response to infection, but not by the current vaccines.&gt;&gt;

So that is the first 2.5 months after second dose.

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577

The press release then reports data through March 13, 2021. Do that is about an additional 5 months. Now there were 77 in vaccinated vs 850 in placebo, once again with approximately equal group sizes.

That means 2.5-7.5 months after second dose they saw 68 casrs in vaccinated vs 681 in placebo. I read that as efficacy dropped from 95% in the first 2.5 months to 90% in months 2.5-7.5.

Here's from the CDC themselves: 

**People with prior or current SARS-CoV-2 infection**

Data from clinical trials indicate that the currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines can be given safely to people with evidence of a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. People should be offered vaccination regardless of history of prior symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral testing to assess for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection or serologic testing to assess for prior infection is not recommended for the purposes of vaccine decision-making.

Vaccination of people with known current SARS-CoV-2 infection should be deferred until the person has recovered from the acute illness (if the person had symptoms) and they have met criteria to discontinue isolation. This recommendation applies to people who experience SARS-CoV-2 infection before receiving any vaccine dose and those who experience SARS-CoV-2 infection after the first dose of an mRNA vaccine but before receipt of the second dose.

**While there is no recommended minimum interval between infection and vaccination**, current evidence suggests that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is low in the months after initial infection but may increase with time due to waning immunity. Thus, while vaccine supply remains limited, people with recent documented acute SARS-CoV-2 infection may choose to temporarily delay vaccination, if desired, recognizing that the risk of reinfection and, therefore, the need for vaccination, might increase with time following initial infection.

The government couldn't have done any better on vaccine recruitment, and the US literally would not allow us to have more MRNA. The contracts the US sign don't simply ban exports, but they massively limit the ability for Moderna and Pfizer to spread their resources across the pond, especially Moderna. 

It's not a question of competence or effort, it's simply US policy which we have no power to change. Biden has no interest in helping the UK. He doesn't like Johnson, has a strong Irish identity, and is desperate to prove he is stronger on China than Trump. US foreign policy will be less eurocentric in the next few years. It's a golden opportunity for the US to increase their influence in the developing world through the currency of vaccines. 

The roadmap will certainly be extended if we don't give out AZ, if we give out AZ then the probability for the roadmap being extended significantly decreases. Based on probabilities, it makes far more sense to vaccinate with AZ now. The roadmap factors in the need for a booster. Whitty said today that the probability of us going back into lockdown even if cases rose significantly is very low.

Had the EU kept all those doses, it'd have a very similar level of doses used as the US, meaning slightly lower per capita but still an improvement. It has sufficiently shown it's able to have a 80% vaccine usage rate, similar to that of the US, which is even more impressive given it's a multitude of nations and the horrific unreliability of AZ that changes delivery amounts days before delivery. This leads to a higher stockpile to account for suddenly receiving millions fewer doses that may have already been scheduled.

But no, keep calling me some blind nationalist, whilst almost certainly in a country currently benefiting from vaccine nationalism and the EU's goodwill.",,,1617298529,{},gt1xjop,False,t3_mhsu7b,False,True,t1_gt1pgom,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mhsu7b/who_says_europes_vaccine_rollout_unacceptably_slow/gt1xjop/,1617300184,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; One of this study’s strengths is its design: participants self-collected nasal swabs each week for RT-PCR laboratory testing, regardless of whether they had developed symptoms of illness.  Researchers were able to look for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection irrespective of symptoms. A small number (10.7 percent) of infections in this study were asymptomatic (i.e., did not result in symptoms). However, the majority of infections (58 percent) occurred among people whose infections were identified by testing before they developed symptoms or knew they were infected. The study demonstrates that these two mRNA vaccines can reduce the risk of all SARS-CoV-2 infections, not just symptomatic infections.

&gt;**This is important because preventing both asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections among health care workers and other essential workers through vaccination can help prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to those they care for or serve**.Findings from this study complement earlier reports that these two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines can reduce both asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.",,,1617284729,{},gt13m4j,False,t3_mhv4aj,False,True,t1_gt11hqd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mhv4aj/vaccinated_heres_how_your_life_may_change_after/gt13m4j/,1617284754,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It goes from impossible to find an appointment, then about a week or two of ""oh wow it's getting easier to book an appointment"" to ""wow, every place has vaccines."" 

While it's not binary (like vaccinations will stop right away), there are many states that have leveled out or declining vaccination rates despite continuously increasing supply. 

Mississippi has gone nowhere from early March (in fact it has gone down) despite being open to all. At their 20K/day rate of administration, their presently delivered vaccine supply lasts 28 days - far more than the justifiable two week administration lag. And the days of supply are growing daily. Alabama is even worse (although they ""technically"" don't have general availability yet, but based on definitions 90%+ of the population is covered). They have 39 days of supply. Compare that to California who is doing okay but not amazing - they have 14 days of supply. Massachusetts? 8 days. 

Very roughly, I categorize states into the following buckets:

Lockdowns are unlikely to be needed again as Britain learns to treat coronavirus like flu, Prof Chris Whitty has said.

The  chief medical officer said that up to 25,000 people die in a bad flu  year without anyone noticing and that accepting some Covid deaths would  be the price of keeping schools and business open and allowing people to  live a ""whole life"".

Prof Whitty,  speaking on a Royal School of Medicine webinar, said the Government  would only be forced to ""pull the alarm cord"" if a dangerous variant  arrived, against which people had no immunity and which sparked  exponential growth.

""Covid is not  going to go away,"" he said. ""You've got to work out what's a rational  policy to this and here I would differentiate quite a lot between a  pandemic environment and what you get with seasonal flu.

""Every  year, somewhere between 7,000 and 9,000 citizens die of flu, most of  them very elderly, and every few years you get a bad flu year where  20,000 to 25,000 die of it. The last time we had that was three years  ago and no one noticed it.

""So it  is clear we are going to have to manage it, at some point, rather like  we manage the flu. Here is a seasonal, very dangerous disease that kills  thousands of people and society has chosen a particular way round it.""

Prof  Whitty said it was important to bring Covid deaths as low as possible,  but warned that society would not tolerate being locked down to prevent  similar numbers of deaths to those from flu.

""We  want to get as close as we can \[to zero\] but the question is how do you  balance that against other priorities?"" he said. ""What are people  prepared to put up with? What we've demonstrated in the last year is we  don't have to have flu at all if we don't want to, because the things  we’ve done against Covid have led to virtually no influenza.

""If  next year we say 'we can deal with flu, everyone lock down over the  winter' I think the medical profession would not make itself popular  with the general public.

""We need  to work out some balance which actually keeps it at a low level,  minimises deaths as best we can, but in a way that the population  tolerates, through medical countermeasures like vaccines and in due  course drugs, which mean you can minimise mortality while not maximising  the economic and social impacts on our fellow citizens.""

Prof  Whitty said although there would always be more measures that could be  put in place to save lives, such as shutting schools and universities or  preventing relatives visiting the elderly in care homes, such  restrictions prevented people from living a ""whole life"".

Asked  by Sir Simon Wessely, professor of psychological medicine at the  Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, whether lockdowns would  be reimposed if cases rose, even in local areas, Prof Whitty said: ""No, I  don't think so.""

However, he  added: ""Society will not tolerate more than a certain number of people  being ill, even if they know it's going to go away come the spring, and  the area where we're going to have to pull the alarm cord is if a  variant of concern comes in that we can see is now back to a situation  of unconstrained growth because the immunological response to it is just  not there.""

Boris Johnson has  previously vowed that the current unlocking of restrictions is  irreversible, and next week the Government will determine whether shops  can reopen on April 12 as planned.

The  latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that  infections in the community are continuing to fall, dropping eight per  cent in a week.

However, Mr  Johnson warned last week that cases were rising in Europe and a third  wave may spread to Britain from the continent. Latest data from the  King's College ZOE symptom tracker app also suggests the 'R' number may  now be at one, or even above in some areas. The ONS warned that cases  may be rising in the East of England.

Prof  Whitty said that it was impossible to prevent variants from coming into  the UK, and argued that shutting the borders would be unlikely to  prevent new infections.

The  Government has been strongly criticised for keeping the borders open  during both lockdowns, even though studies have shown that the vast  majority of Britain’s cases were imported from countries like Spain and  Italy.

""We have to accept the idea  that stopping variants coming to the UK is not a realistic starting  point, but you can slow it down,"" he said. ""Anyone who believes you can  put up some border policy that stops it is misunderstanding the problem  completely.

""While the 'R' is less  than one, which it has been for two or three months, then new variants  don't have much of a foothold.

### Background

A new variant of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7, emerged as the dominant cause of COVID-19 disease in the UK from November, 2020. We report a post-hoc analysis of the efficacy of the adenoviral vector vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), against this variant.

### Methods

Volunteers (aged ≥18 years) who were enrolled in phase 2/3 vaccine efficacy studies in the UK, and who were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or a meningococcal conjugate control (MenACWY) vaccine, provided upper airway swabs on a weekly basis and also if they developed symptoms of COVID-19 disease (a cough, a fever of 37·8°C or higher, shortness of breath, anosmia, or ageusia). Swabs were tested by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for SARS-CoV-2 and positive samples were sequenced through the COVID-19 Genomics UK consortium. Neutralising antibody responses were measured using a live-virus microneutralisation assay against the B.1.1.7 lineage and a canonical non-B.1.1.7 lineage (Victoria). The efficacy analysis included symptomatic COVID-19 in seronegative participants with a NAAT positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine. Participants were analysed according to vaccine received. Vaccine efficacy was calculated as 1 − relative risk (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 *vs*MenACWY groups) derived from a robust Poisson regression model. This study is continuing and is registered with [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov/), [NCT04400838](http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04400838), and ISRCTN, 15281137.

### Findings

Participants in efficacy cohorts were recruited between May 31 and Nov 13, 2020, and received booster doses between Aug 3 and Dec 30, 2020. Of 8534 participants in the primary efficacy cohort, 6636 (78%) were aged 18–55 years and 5065 (59%) were female. Between Oct 1, 2020, and Jan 14, 2021, 520 participants developed SARS-CoV-2 infection. 1466 NAAT positive nose and throat swabs were collected from these participants during the trial. Of these, 401 swabs from 311 participants were successfully sequenced. Laboratory virus neutralisation activity by vaccine-induced antibodies was lower against the B.1.1.7 variant than against the Victoria lineage (geometric mean ratio 8·9, 95% CI 7·2–11·0). Clinical vaccine efficacy against symptomatic NAAT positive infection was 70·4% (95% CI 43·6–84·5) for B.1.1.7 and 81·5% (67·9–89·4) for non-B.1.1.7 lineages.

### Interpretation

ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 showed reduced neutralisation activity against the B.1.1.7 variant compared with a non-B.1.1.7 variant in vitro, but the vaccine showed efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2.

Any answer you get that is either ""yes"" or ""no"" is wrong, for now. We have only ""maybe, probably not"", and it's going to be that way for a long time.

Challenge studies with monkeys look [*really good.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03041-6) They show strong immunity, or [sterilizing immunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/la4fud/immunogenic_bnt162b_vaccines_protect_rhesus/) from multiple vaccine types.  We're still figuring out if and how much sterilizing immunity can be expected from the current vaccines, though it's starting to look really good.

Also, you'll notice that any reputable person talking about this subject always says ""may be able to spread"", or ""maybe"", or ""we don't know if"". And that's because there is a small chance that vaccinated people will be able to spread the virus. But it's not a big chance. Doctors, scientists, and regulators are being very careful with their language on this subject, some would argue they're being too careful. That said, if they were to say that ""vaccinated people cannot spread the virus"", and then we find out that in some situations that vaccinated people have spread the virus, [that would end up worse for them than if they hedge for a while.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/los8r9/daily_discussion_thread_february_21_2021/goa8cu0/) So at least to me, the way they're framing it seems pretty reasonable, you just have to put yourself in their shoes.

That said, they seem to be [saying what I've been saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s).

**Additional Thoughts/Cool Stuff**

Even the shittiest masks do seem to work, [but why?](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/md436k/another_explanation_for_why_cloth_masks_reduce/)

Testing and the Positivity Rate: It's been said a lot in other subs that the positivity rate should go up over time as more people are vaccinated and don't require testing. Last year, it was *the* metric to watch, but it will likely wane quickly in importance as overall testing drops.  Don't necessarily worry about sudden high positivity rates, as mass testing will likely drop off pretty quickly, particularly as testing sites are converted to vaccination sites. 

We may want to use our newly found testing and sequencing capacity to test and sequence a higher proportion of flu samples.  This might give us a head start on which flu genetics are circulating, and help eliminate a flu or two.  We're in the single digits of flu cases most places, which is awesome!

The problem is that you have to wait longer for the second dose, and therefore, full protection.

Just because [mRNA vaccines aren't 100% effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/)  against the SA variant, *doesn't* [mean that we'll definitely need boosters](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gmu581s/).

I like [thegracefuldork's prediction about vaccine availability](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lcatpp/daily_discussion_thread_february_04_2021/gm0bwc8/) more than my own previous prediction.  Not because it's ""rosier"", but because it's just better.

**Which vaccine should I get?**

When someone asks me what my favorite beer is, the answer is always the same.

It's the one in front of me.

So get the first vaccine you can, the differences are pretty minor.


[**Conclusions**](https://gfycat.com/cleantalkativedassie)

Okay, so the vaccines reduce infections, and if someone gets an infection after getting vaccinated, they have fewer and reduced symptoms.  This currently seems to also be true with post vaccination infection with any of the known variants. We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with mild symptoms spread only slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well. 

In other words: A reduction in symptoms is at least correlated with a reduction in the ability to spread the virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections and symptoms in those who do get infected. Therefore, vaccines should reduce spread.

Regarding side effects of the vaccine:

Nobody is saying there aren't side effects. There are clearly side effects. I'm not even saying there aren't side effects from the vaccine that could last for years. The effects of an infection may not show up for a while, [and we know they can last a long time](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m4jhpf/rapid_implementation_of_a_cohort_for_the_study_of/), most notably a loss of sense of smell.

I'm saying that we'd find out about all the side effects within a few months. There won't be side effects that suddenly show up six months after vaccination that haven't already shown up in some people.

If you have an example of a side effect from any vaccine where side effects not seen within the first four months were suddenly found over four months post-vaccination, I'd change the wording in my post.

I'll tell you though, I've still not gotten an example of a vaccine side effect that didn't show up in at least some people until way after the vaccine was administered.

I read up this morning. In the CDC study she was referring to, it concluded ""Under real-world conditions, mRNA vaccine effectiveness of full immunization (≥14 days after second dose) was 90% against SARS-CoV-2 infections regardless of symptom status"" 

If this headline were to be true on an individual basis you would expect to see a zero covid mortality and hospitalization in full immunized individuals on account of covid infection being impossible. This is not what has occurred in any region. Israel reports cases of hospitalizations in the vaccinated population.  

Overall the likelihood of infection detection is massively lower (and a reduction in viral load and shedding has been demonstrated.) They will certainly help bring an end to this pandemic with compounding effects of wide rollout.

I'm in defense contracting, and my program's job is to warn soldiers when a short range rocket or mortar is going to land in their base, so they can take cover. When we first rolled it out, our warning threshold was set to 1 in 1000- that is if there was a 0.1% chance the rocket or mortar would land in the base, we sent up the alert. We thought that this was being safe, but actually- it wasn't. 

It didn't take long for soldiers to not take the warning seriously. There were too many false alarms. So, when the alarm went off, most of the time, nothing happened, so the soldiers stopped taking cover. But then, when a rocket did hit, none of them took cover, and people died. 

So, we raised the threshold. Now, there may be some ""leakage"" where a rocket lands that we don't warn on, but it's very rare, and every time the alarm goes off, people take cover. So, even with missing a shot or two, we're better off being less cautious, because human nature cannot be defeated. 

So, while I don't blame the messaging from the CDC and Fauci, it's such a human mistake to make, I feel like they've been too conservative, a little too worst case scenario, in their messaging, where eventually, people tune them out.

&gt;Regarding the second vaccine dose for younger persons who have already received a first dose of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, there is no scientific evidence yet on the safety and efficacy of a heterologous vaccination series. Until appropriate data are available, STIKO recommends administering one dose of mRNA vaccine 12 weeks after the initial vaccination in place of the second AstraZeneca vaccine dose in persons aged &lt;60 years

&gt;Based on current knowledge, basic immunization that has been started must be completed with the same product. An exception is made for persons aged &lt;60 years who have already received an initial vaccination with AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. For these individuals, it is recommended that a dose of mRNA vaccine be administered 12 weeks after the initial vaccination in lieu of the second AstraZeneca vaccine dose. The rationale for this is that the protection elicited by a single AstraZeneca vaccination begins to decline after 12 weeks. STIKO recommends a study investigating immunological effects following the heterologous vaccination schedule.

If you were me, would you take the unproven second mRNA shot? My biggest worry is that this is only approved on a national level. I don't doubt safety or immunization levels at all.

Pfizer is better than AZ as stopping transmission, but I doubt it's as good as these studies suggest. We will inevitably need boosters anyway, as the virus will mutate as we will never get the vaccine coverage required globally to stop transmission. India have a population of over 1 billion, and they've barely started their rollout. The US will not get anywhere near the vaccination rates we get, and the virus will still spread and mutate. I think we just have to accept the reality of boosters rather than aiming for an end to variants.

If the ZA variant evades all protection from the AZ vaccine (severe illness etc), then we'll have to slow down the roadmap and probably implement a short term New Zealand style border closure. We're tracking the spread of the ZA variant and I think we can be confident that we can act quickly if the data suggests the ZA variant is starting to grow. Currently it's still having a miniscule impact on our total case number. Ironically, the AZ jab's inability to stop transmission might be a silver lining, as it will ensure the UK variant continues to circulate and outflank new variants. 

Pfizer have shown no indication they have the capabilities to produce their vaccine enough for us to rely on MRNA like the US. If the EU implement an export ban, Pfizer will moan but will take the EU's money (especially given Germany are the biggest funder, alongside the US, for the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine). Moderna are still setting up their EU facility in Switzerland and are very vague about their rollout in Europe.

The US have immense control over Pfizer and Moderna. They have very strong contracts, and unashamedly implemented the toughest export ban in the world. Pfizer and Moderna are getting to much money from the US to moan about export restrictions.

I managed to find the Lancet article more easily than I expected. Turns out it's from late Feb not early March. You can see it here: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7906658/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7906658/)  


Their concern seems to be twofold, firstly that the assumption underpinning the decision to follow a 3 month strategy is not based on evidence. Essentially that *"" However, the biology is straightforward and will be the same as with all vaccines . . . The immune system remembers the first dose and will respond whether the later dose is at three weeks or three months""* was not underpinned by any scientific evidence. Secondly that a large number of people with partial Pfizer protection risks the emergence of variants immune to that vaccine.   


To my mind, planing your vaccine strategy around an assumption with no evidence to back it up is a gamble. Even if it is a sensible one because the potential consequences are dire.
