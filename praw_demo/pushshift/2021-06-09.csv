I think the US has done many good and many bad things. I did mention some of the bad things to prove a point, that the US is not necessarily better than the allies you feel have failed you, but what I meant was that I am not criticizing the US over this issue.

What I meant earlier was that your sentiment, as well as other Americans sharing the same sentiment, does damage foreigners view of the country and cements the view of Americans ""only caring about themselves"". Still I understand that your views does not represent Americans as a whole, and that was why I was only criticizing you and your sentiment and not the entire population of the US.

&gt; Right or wrong, I‚Äôve drawn the opinion of you that all you want to do is give away American taxpayer money so that it appears altruistic on the world stage.

Well, yes, I do think that richer countries should help poorer countries. Not necessarily to appear altruistic, but because it would actually make a difference and help humanity.

And if you don't care about altruism there are still selfish, strategical reasons to do this. Vaccine diplomacy is a very cost-effective form of power projection since only a few places hold the means of production and time is of the essence. There are few chances like this to project so much soft power for so little money.

The motives don't matter much to me, what matters is the actions.

Koca's speech is as follows:  
""I am here to inform you about the last meeting of our Science Board, where we discussed our vaccination program and local vaccination studies. As you can see, I am now coming before you to give you information about how we will ensure normalization faster and safer, not suggestions about what restrictions will be applied and what measures to take.  
For a long time, we have been fighting a struggle that has encompassed all areas of life. Now, our agenda is how to get immunity with the vaccine program and return to our old normals as soon as possible. These difficult days are now behind us. We will continue our work from where we left off.  
The days when we will kiss the hands of our elders, hug with our loved ones and shake hands without hesitation are near. We are on the eve of the days when we will walk hand in hand in the parks, make the holiday like a vacation, and set our agenda, not the epidemic. To return safely to our old days, I would like to draw your attention to three important issues.  
VACCINATION OVER 40 YEARS OLD  
The first is that our citizens, whose turn it is, are vaccinated without delay. This is the first condition for us to gain herd immunity as soon as possible. Whether it's your turn due to age or occupational group, please get your vaccine without wasting time. As of tomorrow, our citizens over the age of 45 are also starting to be vaccinated. On the next Monday, all our citizens over the age of 40 will be included in the vaccination program.  
Secondly, let's continue to follow our personal measures without compromise until we achieve social immunity with vaccination. Our citizens who have been vaccinated should also comply with the measures until social immunity is obtained. Let's not forget, it takes a certain time for the vaccine to protect us.  
""TURKISH VACCINE HAS COME TO THE FINAL STAGE""  
The third is to ensure the sustainability of epidemic control. For this, our own vaccine should be used instead of the vaccines we have supplied from outside until now. As you know, many vaccine development projects are ongoing and we have reached the final stage in one of them. Next week we will vaccinate our volunteers for Phase III human studies, the final phase of our domestic vaccine. The Turkish vaccine has reached the final stage. Together, we will experience this important development that will end the continuity of epidemic control and foreign dependency in vaccines.  
Scientific studies continue on the subject that vaccines provide immunity for a certain period of time and that people who receive two doses of vaccine should receive a third dose of vaccine. A clinical study on this subject has also been planned by our ministry, which vaccines can be used crosswise and the use of our domestic vaccine as the third dose is being evaluated.  
I hope you will see the Minister of Health less and hear his voice less. I see that the most important news I will give you from now on will be the success of our domestic vaccine and the statement that the epidemic is over, and I look forward to that day.

&gt;
&gt;The problem, however, is that in the study only 1130 children were vaccinated and observed for two months. According to Mertens, this does not allow any reliable conclusions to be drawn about less common side effects. If the data situation changes in such a way that this risk can be excluded with sufficient certainty, the STIKO will re-examine the data and, if necessary, adjust the recommendation.
&gt;
&gt;Mertens also pointed out that serious illnesses are very rare in the age group in question. It does happen again and again. ""Overall, however, the burden of disease among children is actually very low."" This can also be seen in the fact that there were only two deaths in the age group in the course of the entire pandemic in Germany. These were children with serious previous illnesses.

That last paragraph is also one of the main reason why they did not recommend it. But still:

&gt;Vaccination for children without previous illnesses is currently not generally recommended. However, it is possible ""after medical advice and with individual wishes and risk acceptance"".

I don't think you understood the article correctly. The article says it's from their own vaccine studies.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In this approach, an immune response biomarker(s) elicited by the vaccine in a pediatric age group is compared to the same immune response biomarker(s) elicited by the same vaccine in a relevant adult age group, with formal statistical hypothesis testing to demonstrate that the measured immune response in the pediatric age group is non-inferior to that in adults.

This is the reason why I say a live attenuated vaccine provides a natural immune response.

However, another difference from a natural infection and the current mRNA vaccines is that the vaccines are injected intramuscularly, versus infection in the respiratory system (and perhaps the intestines) in the case of a natural infection.

I would say that my arguments are backed up by simple observations for which I have yet to receive satisfactory explanations. As with most medical science it's based on an incomplete understanding of how the body works and a lot of empirical data to fill in the holes.

Think of it this way. Making a vaccine is not like building a bridge. You don't have to build 40,000 bridges in order to certify a particular bridge design as safe. Why?

First, the national CDC variant data is out https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions, and you can see that P1 is doing pretty well, growing from 4.8% week ended 4/24 to 6.3% week ended 5/8 to 8.1% week ended 5/22. However, overall cases are going down faster than that nationally, so nationally, P1 is growing as a percentage even while the total number of cases is likely dropping.  


Delta, the India variant, B.1.617.2, grew from 0.6% to 1.3% to 2.5%. The error bars are large on this, but it looks like it's doubling as a percent of total every two weeks. For comparison, nationally cases went from 7 day average 55,194 to 40,236 to 24904. So, extrapolating (with wide error bars), that means an estimated 331 cases to 523 cases to 622 cases. In other words, delta is growing, doubling about every 4 weeks, with wide error bars. Given increases in vaccination nationally over the past four weeks, nationally delta is likely growing very slow or flat now, but places with low vaccination are likely seeing growth.  


In addition, the Washington state variant report is out, https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/data-tables/420-316-SequencingAndVariantsReport.pdf  
P.1 is up to 13.6% for week ended 5/22, from 9.1% week ended May 8. That's comparable to the pace at which Washington state is trending down, so overall P.1 is probably roughly constant based on the Washington State dashboard 7 day average epidemiologic curves - both weeks would have about 110 cases of P1, so P1 is basically flat in Washington state. Elsewhere in that report is the only data I've been able to find on vaccine escapes in WA or elsewhere. 20% of escapes are P1, compared to 7% P1 overall. P1 does seem a bit scary in that regard. 2% of escapes are Delta, compared to 1% overall, but those numbers are too small to draw any conclusions.",,,1623277927,{},h17mczd,True,t3_nw87na,False,True,t3_nw87na,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nw87na/cdc_covid_data_tracker/h17mczd/,1623488120,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Thank you for exposing your lack of understanding of the scientific process.

Science is evidence based, because no evidence exists for increased severity we default, based on all relevant data that there is no increase in disease severity. However, because the data is limited we can‚Äôt say that conclusively. However, thank you once again for proving my point. You‚Äôve named 3 mutations, who‚Äôs effects are understood to a degree. Do you know what they all have in common? None of them effect disease progression, and we have ample evidence of this.

So let me spell it out for you 

No evidence that delta variant increases disease severity - limited data on delta variant specifically + individual effect of delta variant mutations + physiological effect of other variants carrying these mutations = no reason to believe the delta variant has any effect on disease severity.

Now, I implore you to stop before you embarrass yourself further. Although il admit it is sometimes entertaining to have random redditors who clearly have very limited knowledge try and educate me on what I both studied and work in.

The capitol city has around 8,000 people and is the only state capitol without a McDonalds (it's a couple miles away in the next town). There are tons of ski areas, and tourists also love to come during fall foliage season (we call them leaf-peepers). Other than tourism, the job market here has historically not been great, and pay isn't great compared to the cost of living. Heating is expensive and cars get rusted with road salt. Vermont produces more maple syrup than any other state and also has more craft beer per capita than any other state. As far as politics go, we're one of the bluest states in the country for general elections, but there's a reasonable amount of bipartisanship for state offices. There are a LOT of gun people here and gun laws are pretty lax for a blue state (I'm personally not a fan, but c'est la vie). There's lots of hunting and fishing. Winters are long and cold and we have mud season in the spring where all the dirt roads get wrecked. Summer (my favorite season) is mostly comfy with the occasional heat wave. A/C isn't super prevalent here. I like swimming in Lake Champlain, which is the 6th-largest freshwater lake in the country.

&gt;State media coverage of the visit Tuesday came as China struggles to vaccinate its population and a major city near Hong Kong battles the Delta COVID variant.   
          
&gt;Beijing previously claimed victory over the coronavirus and has publicly championed the Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines.

&gt;China's new COVID epicenter is Guangzhou, Guangdong Province. According to the Times, the city has ordered its population of 18.7 million to undergo tests between Sunday and Tuesday, after each infected person spread the virus to more people than in past outbreaks.  
    
&gt;Entire neighborhoods are in complete lockdown, with no people allowed outside unless they are being tested, the report said.

Think of B.1.351 as the floor, or ""worst case scenario"" for efficacy.

We know that J&amp;J has an efficacy of 64% against B.1.351. That means that efficacy against the Indian variants is likely AT LEAST 64% and probably higher. There is no reason or mechanism that would cause it to be lower than 64%, since B.1.351 has greater immune escape capabilities.

Yes, we want to see data on the Delta variant, but we can make good educated guesses. A variant with less immune escape than B.1.351 has no logical reason to confer a lower efficacy.

Because no one should be forced to get a vaccine under EUA.

That‚Äôs it.

I got the vaccine, earlier than most my age because there was a spare dose left at my wife‚Äôs hospital early in the roll out, my was one of the first in the country to get her first dose, we have lived the nightmare of Covid since March 2020.

We had to separate after a very early exposure, we had to park an RV out front just incase she got sick at work as they had so little PPE that they were re-using N95‚Äôs for days but couldn‚Äôt bring in their own, I had to transition to WFH to teach the kids while my wife‚Äôs hours doubled and her salary stayed the same (something that lasted just about 10 months, 10 months of two full time jobs and a day off a week), and I had to support a wife as wave after wave of whole families got admitted to the hospital in mid January 2021, most far too sick for my wife‚Äôs hospitals acuity, but there was no where even an air ambulance to get them that had open beds, so they did what they could with the gear they had.

I watched as my military doctor buddies got deployed all over the country to no press, just moving from failed hospital to failed hospital across rural CA and the Midwest, and they faced a steady stream of patients who straight up denied they had covid even as they were getting out on bipap and being shown the positive test result.

And now with the vaccine that‚Äôs all a memory, we are making summer vacation plans, my wife has ZERO covid in her hospital, and most of my buddies are home with their families (some are doing vaccine distribution).

But as much as I believe in the vaccines, AND an politically neutral, check my posts I‚Äôm very anti-CoVID-19 and anti-misinformation, I can‚Äôt support people being forced to take a vaccine that‚Äôs not fully approved.

Taipei, June 10 (CNA) Taiwan on Thursday reported 266 new COVID-19 cases -- 263 domestic, three imported -- and 28 deaths from the disease, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).

Thursday was also the fourth consecutive day case totals have been in the 200s, which Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (Èô≥ÊôÇ‰∏≠) said indicates case numbers are on a downtrend.

However, whether that trend continues remains to be seen, Chen said.

New Taipei reported 112 of the new domestic cases, the highest number, followed by Taipei with 58 and Miaoli County with 43.

Taoyuan reported 14, Keelung 12, Changhua County 10, Hualien County seven, while two each were reported in Nantou and Hsinchu counties. Tainan City, Yilan and Taitung counties reported one case each.

The CECC said that five of the cases had an unknown source of infection, while four were under investigation.

The three imported cases, meanwhile, involved Taiwanese nationals who returned from India, Nigeria and the United States.

According to the CECC, the woman in her 40s who returned from the U.S. received two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in April and arrived in Taiwan on June 3.

On June 7, the woman started to cough and had a runny nose. A relative she was staying with developed a fever a few days later and tested positive for COVID-19, as a result of which she was tested. The results came back positive on Thursday, the CECC said.

Commenting on the case, CECC official Lo Yi-chun (ÁæÖ‰∏ÄÈàû) said that COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe cases of the disease and death. They also help prevent asymptomatic and mild infections though to a lesser extent.

It is still possible for vaccinated people to become infected, though they tend to be less infectious and have less viral load than unvaccinated patients, Lo said.

The 28 deaths reported Thursday were 21 men and seven women, aged 50 to 100, who passed away between June 1 and June 9, according to the CECC.

To date, Taiwan has confirmed a total of 12,222 COVID-19 cases, over 10,500 of which are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded more than 100 cases in a single day.

The number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths in the country has risen to 361, including 349 recorded since May 15, CECC data shows.

Coronavirus is endemic among wildlife in the Wuhan region. The lab studying coronavirus was of course located there. There was a Zika lab only miles from the Zika outbreak a few years ago, that doesn't mean it came from a lab, it doesn't even suggest it. That's like arguing that hospitals make people sick because of all the sick people in them.

I feel the same about not making such a big deal about getting the 2nd shot of Pfizer and Moderna. With these nutters, you have to get to them early, make them feel like they're somehow in an exclusive group that does not yet include others less fortunate than them, and then jab them wherever they stand. Make it easy. And when they start hearing stories about how the 2nd shot is laying people out for a day or two, at least they're already jabbed and one less person to spread to. By the time they're sticking metal objects to their body, they're hopefully at least at 50% effectiveness with the one shot. 

It's basically a calculus of, ""let's just strike and jab the people we KNOW are gonna say things like, 'the shot magnetizes you and makes you communicable with 5g antennas"" and just do what we can to get as many of those idiots as possible while its still possible to make them feel like they're special. Cause they're special all right...

But no... a big problem in the U.S. and this is now being extensively covered as we begin to ever-so-slowly reach a stage where we can assess the pandemic from a historical perspective, is that when certain measures would have helped, the scientific community, the media, and often the government as well all took an almost too-cautious approach or would say, ""the evidence for aerosols isn't there (it was, just read the Linsey Marr AMA on the sidebar)"", ""the evidence for masks is very circumspect"", the shot ONLY works if you get two doses. And then when they gave into the actual data and what was already being done in other countries, they still stuck too close to the script and found NEW things to be alarmist about. 

It's such a cycle of absurdity and I'm not saying that someone like this lady is right or that we need to kow-tow to the lunatics. I'm saying that there's a psychological angle to everything, and the U.S. fails the psychological angle in so many regards that it's laughable.

So two minutes into the podcast, Dr Griffin goes into the pessimistic modeling published in JAMA that did not pan out. Cases are actually dropping exponentially while mask mandates were lifted before a highly vaccinated society was achieved. Then you have his anecdote about lifting mask mandates leading to increased vaccinations. I‚Äôm sure the truth will be teased out over time as to whether which type of messaging is more effective, but so far the data is supporting that lifting mask mandates did not cause increases in cases, in America.

Not only America but for so much of the world, the collectivist ideal in how we can tackle pandemics seem like such a pipe dream due to the tribal divide within nations.

[https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2021/05/covid-19-vaccine-trials-for-children-under-12.html](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2021/05/covid-19-vaccine-trials-for-children-under-12.html)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Phase 2-3 trial will enroll as many as 200 children ages 5 through 11 at Stanford and a total of 4,600 children at 40 sites nationwide. The study is placebo-controlled, so some participants will be randomly assigned to receive placebo while others will receive the vaccine.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to evolve around the world, generating new variants that are of concern based on their potential for altered transmissibility, pathogenicity, and coverage by vaccines and therapeutics1‚Äì5.

Geometric mean plaque reduction neutralization titers against the variant viruses, particularly the B.1.617.1 variant, appear lower than the titer against USA-WA1/2020 virus, but all sera tested neutralize the variant viruses at titers of at least 40.

I mentioned what would be significantly more impactful - the sick wearing masks to stop the spread. This isn't talking down to you, I hope.

I gave my two cents (worth about as much on an online forum anyways) on my personal desire to wear masks still.

I clearly said you should do what you want to do. ***You*** should do whatever makes ***you*** feel comfortable. It has ***no impact*** on my life if ***you*** wear a mask.  


&gt;Relevant quote from CDC: During a pandemic, cloth masks may be the only option available; however, they should be used as a last resort when medical masks and respirators are not available (3). Cloth mask use should not be mandated for healthcare workers, but some may choose to use them if there are no alternatives (30). Protection is affected by proper mask use as well as by selection of fabric and design of the masks for water resistance, filtration, and fit. Current evidence suggests that multilayered masks with water-resistant fabric, high number of threads, and finer weave may be more protective (3,10). Several studies have examined filtration, but fewer have examined fit or water resistance. Surgical masks are normally rated for fluid resistance, and cloth masks should be too. Masks should be able to prevent a stream of fluid flowing at a pressure of up to 160 mm Hg from seeping through the mask and potentially into the mouth. Furthermore, the degree of fit affects effectiveness because air flows in the direction of least resistance; if gaps are present on the sides of the mask, air will flow through those gaps instead of through the mask.

If you are using the correct type of fabrics and have a good seal on your face you could be protecting yourself, but probably not that much. To really protect yourself from viruses from others you would need at least an N95 mask (N100 preferred).

At a very young age infants rely on their mothers antibodies. After this stops, they‚Äôre adaptative immune systems (like the humoral immune system), produces a repertoire of immature B cells that will undergo clonal expansion when exposed to a pathogen that the B cell receptor recognizes. This expansion process can take a while when you‚Äôre first exposed to a novel pathogen. Overtime, selection occurs for B plasma cells that produce antibodies with greater avidity (binding tightness to an epitope).

If you don‚Äôt get exposed to those pathogens, many common childhood illnesses can be contracted later on, but you‚Äôre immune system hasn‚Äôt had the time to refine that response (like selecting for greater avidity). The result is those common childhood infections, or some that may not even produce symptoms, can be contracted and be much more severe and cause more serious complications.

In other words, yes-social distancing is not good for young children.

The thing is though, it sort of does - precisely because ""they"" think it does.

I've always stated lab leak was a plausible theory, and I even will go so far as to say it's a coin flip for me either way.  I will also state I really don't care other than in a scientific ""how do we prevent it in the future"" sense.

Politically speaking it's a different story.

I still thought anyone in a remote position of power giving credence to this theory a year ago was at the utter peak of irresponsibility though.  Let's say the CIA knows 100% that it's a lab leak and did fairly early on.

The end result is at minimum a full out trade war and millions more dead, if not a full blown escalation to an all-out shooting war.

In the end you can't really sanction or go to war with a country you rely 100% on for your own recovery - so if you had such information you simply sit on it as you divest your dependence.  Then you go public when you can survive.

And why is it said that ""Currently described lineages B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3 have distinct mutation profiles and warrant individual assessment. Given the still very limited available data with respect to their transmissibility, disease severity and immune escape potential relative to other co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants in the EU/EEA, the full impact of these lineages on public health is not yet possible to assess.""

The variant is ""*made of*"" RNA.  Just like the other variants.  

If you meant to ask what the differences are in this variant:

It has 13 mutations from the original virus.

One of those mutations is E484Q.  Some other variants have a mutation at position 484, but those ones have E484K.  There is some evidence of E484Q contributing to immune escape.

One of those mutations is L452R.  There is evidence that this mutation causes decreased neutralization from monoclonal antibodies. 

One of those mutations is P681R, which could contribute to increased transmissibility due to it's position adjacent to the furin cleavage site of the spike protein.

I could keep going, but the end result is that more research is needed to understand if the full combination of mutations causes changes in transmissibility, disease virulence, disease presentation, or immune escape.",,,1623290235,{},h18bhr2,False,t3_nw2yii,False,False,t1_h189eh0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nw2yii/gangrene_hearing_loss_show_delta_variant_may_be/h18bhr2/,1623502915,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,jfklein,,,[],,,,text,t2_59kyk,False,False,[],"The problem is that even though it has been a long, long time since we were hunter-gatherers, it has only been a blink of the eye on an evolutionary time scale. Essentially we are genetically the same as our hunter-gatherer ancestors.

Preservatives have been a useful tool to keep food from spoiling. But that doesn't make the preservative healthy to eat.

Added salt isn't essential for the human body. There are primitive tribes in the Amazon jungle who don't eat any added salt and don't even have a word for it. Basically all of the fossil remains of ancient humans are inland. So, they didn't have any added salt in their diets either. But it's likely that ancient humans who lived on the coast of the seas did use seawater to flavour their food. So we probably have the ability to consume a certain amount of salt. Then the composition of table salt is an issue because it an issue because it is pure NaCl, whereas sea salt has a bunch of other minerals including K. If you're going to use some salt on your food, make it sea salt.

Added sugar - not good, we eat way more than ancient people, diabetes. You don't need any more than what you will get from fruit and vegetables, which are already cultivated to be sweeter than their wild forms.

Grain foods - the theory is that hunter-gatherers didn't eat any because the energy expended to collect little grass seeds is more than you gain from eating them. Grain foods rot teeth too. Skeletal remains from farming societies show major tooth rot. I haven't eaten any grain foods in a few years now, no cavities and haven't seen a dentist since 2015.

Dairy - Our evolutionary ancestors most definitely did not consume cow's milk. Cow's milk contains enzymes and other stuff to promote growth and pass on immunity to baby cows.

Legumes - These are a bit controversial. Legumes can be poisonous if eaten raw. So the theory is that our primitive ancestors did not eat them. But sometime I will eat cooked legumes at a restaurant.

The Paleo diet is still an evolving thing. The basic premise is to eat foods that our evolutionary ancestors ate because our bodies are most likely adapted to those foods. But it isn't entirely know what foods these are. So a lot of it is based on some assumptions and reasoning. But there are certainly some things that can be ruled out like modern preservatives, dairy and table salt, added sugar and grains too.",,,1623280709,{},h17s6lf,True,t3_ntcp34,False,True,t1_h166a83,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ntcp34/covid19_codagenix_currently_the_only_live/h17s6lf/,1623491411,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I don't doubt people with great diets, healthy bodies and a powerful and responsive immune system can handle COVID.    

It is analogous to training.    You might be really really strong and confident that you can handle that big thing in the future.   You'll be able to handle that big thing when the time comes.  It may even take your body fewer days to fight off the virus in its rapidly replicating state.   Maybe a 5 days instead of 10.    With a vaccine, maybe your body can be exposed to COVID and fight it off in 1 day.  That is still 4 days that your body will be sloughing off the virus - even if you are asymptomatic.  Not training for - or being ready to deal with it quickly doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you consider the common good. 

Avoiding training your immune system to handle the virus pre-emptively is a choice you are making.   Fact is, there are others that are not as healthy, strong willed or hosting a strong responsive immune system.    The virus makes immune systems stronger than they are.

If you are tying to find magnetism, autism - that hasn't been found yet.   

If you are worried about long term hazards, that is a fair uncertainty.  People with the AZ vaccine balanced the risk of blood clots with the risk of negative impacts of getting COVID.  Risk of COVID is pretty high. 

Getting the poke takes like 15 minutes and strengthens your immune system even more.  It reduces the risk to other.

What you said above, that it could at any time change and render the vaccine completely ineffective, sounds fast. Although it is a year old, here's a reputable article about how slowly it mutates and it seems to sum up what I've been trying to say, that it will mutate slowly enough to have an effective vaccine for awhile.

[https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/06/10/sars-cov-2-dna-suggests-single-vaccine-will-be-effective/](https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/06/10/sars-cov-2-dna-suggests-single-vaccine-will-be-effective/)

Some notable quotes:

&gt;Coronaviruses typically mutate more slowly than many other viruses. Influenza, for example, mutates quickly, which is why people must be inoculated annually against changing flu strains.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The low mutation rate of the virus means it should be possible to generate a successful vaccine,""

I found this one particularly interesting:

&gt;When a virus replicates‚Äîmakes copies of its genome within a cell‚Äîit uses an enzyme called a polymerase. Some viruses have very accurate versions of these, while others, such as HIV or influenza, do not, Thielen says. ""Coronavirus polymerases have something we call 'proofreading activity,' which is exactly like it sounds,"" he says. ""Once a genome is replicated, the enzyme will identify mistakes it has made and correct them. Sometimes it still gets things wrong, however, and small changes can occur.""

It worked, but just [for a little while](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/slovakia/).  Unless population-wide testing is paired with total border shutdown and a ""real"" lockdown-to-elimination, you just push the spread off a couple of weeks.  And if you do a real lockdown-to-elimination, you might as well not bother with testing everyone since everyone's theoretically home anyway.

I do think if rapid tests were available on-demand from the beginning, we could have saved a lot of lives.  In addition to regulatory delays, which probably do have some room for improvement, you have to remember that the testing supply chain for chemicals, test tubes, etc. was overstretched immediately.  

The only thing we could have done about that was kickstart those supply chains much earlier, as soon as we heard *rumours* of something brewing in China.  And as much as the previous administration clearly did wrong, I honestly don't know if any administration would have taken specific concrete actions any sooner than late February / early March.

Biden has also now successfully lifted the export embargo and allows Canada to have our Moderna orders filled from US factories.

I‚Äôm glad the US has recently allowed this, but IMO they are getting far too much praise for opening up this late in the game. Canada has vaccinated 63% (first dose) and 9% (second dose) on the generosity and good will from the European Union.

This isn't a magical virus and the Delta variant isn't a magical variant.

For all the vaccines, ""vanilla"" (D614G) has the highest efficacy and the lowest immune escape. Then B.1.1.7, then P.1, then B.1.351. B.1.617 is somewhere between B.1.351 and P.1 when it comes to immune escape/antibody neutralization, and so far efficacy against it is in between B.1.351 and P.1 as well.

Mass vaccination has the potential to curb the current COVID-19 pandemic by protecting individuals who have been vaccinated against the disease and possibly lowering the likelihood of transmission to individuals who have not been vaccinated. The high effectiveness of the widely administered BNT162b vaccine from Pfizer‚ÄìBioNTech in preventing not only the disease but also infection with SARS-CoV-2 suggests a potential for a population-level effect, which is critical for disease eradication. However, this putative effect is difficult to observe, especially in light of highly fluctuating spatiotemporal epidemic dynamics. Here, by analyzing vaccination records and test results collected during the rapid vaccine rollout in a large population from 177 geographically defined communities, we find that the rates of vaccination in each community are associated with a substantial later decline in infections among a cohort of individuals aged under 16‚Äâyears, who are unvaccinated. On average, for each 20‚Äâpercentage points of individuals who are vaccinated in a given population, the positive test fraction for the unvaccinated population decreased approximately twofold. These results provide observational evidence that vaccination not only protects individuals who have been vaccinated but also provides cross-protection to unvaccinated individuals in the community.",,,1623341013,{},h1alkhl,True,t3_nwr95e,False,False,t3_nwr95e,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nwr95e/communitylevel_evidence_for_sarscov2_vaccine/h1alkhl/,1623556203,13,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Still totally worth checking out if you haven't already. Hasn't gone out of date yet. 

[Original Comment 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mnzwri/daily_discussion_thread_april_10_2021/gu200jr/) - Additional stuff, thoughts. Much less worth checking out, but there are a few things in there that are still good.

If you have any food that you bought last year for Covid lockdown/emergencies/etc., now is the time to eat it or donate it to a food pantry. If it's expired, eat it or toss it instead of donating it please.  If you want to be prepared for future emergencies, go ahead and buy more to replace it, I guess.

If you're an American and you've been waiting for your turn to get vaccinated, it's your turn.

If you are vaccinated, it's your turn to help other people get vaccinated. 

If you have a strategy to get older Americans vaccinated, please spread the word. 

The vaccines are FREE in the US.  FREE FREE, not like ""Copay free"", like fuckin FREE. You don't need insurance. Go get one. Now.  Is there something stopping you from going to get one today? Talk to me about it, we'll get it worked out.  

If your doctor offers to give you the vaccine, take it, right away. It *will be absolutely free*. If you get a bill for the vaccine, call the cops or something, [it's *ILLEGAL* to charge you for the vaccine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nvzofq/government_warns_doctors_and_insurers_dont_bill/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

[Dose intervals might increase efficacy if extended past 3 or 4 weeks,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/mudvjd/questin_about_vaccine_intervals/gv58byt/) CDC says you have up to 42 days between doses (but that may be extended at some point).

Okay, more good news:

The J&amp;J ""Pause"" shows that [the CDC is doing a good job](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mpx0sk/daily_discussion_thread_april_13_2021/gufofqg/?sort=confidence) at being a watchdog over the vaccines.

**More variant stuff:**

Please don't say ""strain"" when you mean ""variant"". 

There [might not be much room left for SARS-CoV-2 to mutate](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/mpcc5k/weekly_question_thread_april_12_2021/gui5xn3/) into.

CDC [doesn't think](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n94zxm/no_evidence_that_pfizer_vaccine_needs_updating/) we'll need boosters/updates/etc for the mRNA vaccines.

Pfizer/Moderna work on the [Double/Triple/Indian Variant](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/n9q3q8/infection_and_vaccineinduced_neutralizing/).

Pfizer (and Moderna, probably) [works on B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 Variants](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/n5r2ry/effectiveness_of_the_bnt162b2_covid19_vaccine/)

And [B.1.617, the Indian/""double/triple mutant"" variant.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nit1sr/covid19_pfizer_vaccine_nearly_90_effective/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

REMINDER: Every time we do a neutralization assay on a variant vs Pfizer/Moderna, we get the same result. [The vaccine wins.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mwpijo/daily_discussion_thread_april_23_2021/gvkm64h/)

T-Cells are really important.  Probably [more important than antibodies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/n5015i/highly_functional_cellular_immunity_in_sarscov2/)

Moderna works great against variants, even [seven months out from the second dose.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ne0wx8/durability_of_mrna1273induced_antibodies_against/)

**The vaccine is better than the disease:**

[Penis issues from Covid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nbh3ez/covid19_endothelial_dysfunction_can_cause/) (but [not the vaccine\).](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/narbhn/researchers_report_covid19_found_in_penile_tissue/)

[Neurological problems](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/na1eri/82_of_people_hospitalized_with_covid19_develop/) from Covid Infection (but not the vaccine).

[Loss of smell](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n88qwv/daily_discussion_thread_may_09_2021/gxiiusd/) is both [common](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6sj6g/daily_discussion_thread_may_07_2021/gxb6wah/) and way [more devastating](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n1efrf/joe_rogan_walks_back_antivaccination_comments/gwcvd0m/) than you'd think.  This does not occur with the vaccines.

Loss of smell [really sucks.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nqkiz5/cdc_touts_smell_training_after_covid19_but_it/) There's a whole subreddit about it ([anosmia](https://www.reddit.com/r/anosmia/comments/nkcta1/3_months_and_minimal_recovery/)), and the people who didn't lose their sense of smell from Covid are tired of everyone asking Covid-loss-of-smell questions.  

[Fewer symptoms = less spread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6sj6g/daily_discussion_thread_may_07_2021/gxbfbt1/)  Vaccines make you have fewer symptoms (*if* you get an infection after vaccination).

From the [NYT:](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/health/cdc-masks-vaccines-variants.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article) 
&gt;Introducing the new recommendations on Thursday, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the C.D.C. director, cited two recent scientific findings as significant factors: Few vaccinated people become infected with the virus, and transmission seems rarer still; and the vaccines appear to be effective against all known variants of the coronavirus. 

Remember, if you got infected, recovered, and then got at least one dose of Pfizer, you have immunity not only to multiple variants, but also SARS-CoV-1, the virus for which we named SARS in 2003.  Turns out much of [the ""breadth"" of that immunity is from the vaccine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/net65c/sarscov2_mrna_vaccines_induce_a_greater_array_of/)

[Truly asymptomatic people don't spread the virus much.  People who are pre-symptomatic, and do go on to have symptoms, can be really good spreaders.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ncsstr/daily_discussion_thread_may_15_2021/gy7idau/)

If I place a blindfold on a person and they try to press two non-magnetic bars into each other, and if I place a rubber ball between the two rods they will perceive that resistance.

It is so noticeable that because they are blindfolded they will not be able to differentiate between an actual rubber ball and the same feeling that a pair of magnets produces. 

That puzzles me. Can you explain that? How can switching the bars from non-magnetic ones with actual magnets produce such a convincing feeling of solidity? What is happening that explains their experience?

&gt; I think it‚Äôs shameful for Biden to interject himself into the debate.

Yeah! How dare Joe Biden, president of the United States of America, interject himself into a debate about global spending on coronavirus vaccination by investing US taxes into 3rd world vaccination efforts. How shameful of him to ""protect Americans against the possibility of a vaccine resistant variant of COVID-19"".

Your objection seems to be about language. ""Biden spends"". But this is how our language works. For every president and every leader in every country.

There's no, absolutely no way to predict what will emerge from this third group. It could be a version of the virus that is far less deadly, but far more transmittable that has the same spike pattern and so generates a good immune response: this kind of mutation could effectively end the pandemic if it occurs and spreads. And likewise it is possible but it is unknown how likely it is that, just as you said, a variant could be discovered tomorrow that has 0% reactivity to the vaccines that we currently have and has a high R factor. This would trigger a second pandemic, effectively. It would be inaccurate to assert any confidence that these kinds of mutations will not occur and that they can't happen at any time.

At a very young age infants rely on their mothers antibodies. After this stops, they‚Äôre adaptative immune systems (like the humoral immune system), produces a repertoire of immature B cells that will undergo clonal expansion when exposed to a pathogen that the B cell receptor recognizes. This expansion process can take a while when you‚Äôre first exposed to a novel pathogen. Overtime, selection occurs for B plasma cells that produce antibodies with greater avidity (binding tightness to an epitope).

If you don‚Äôt get exposed to those pathogens, many common childhood illnesses can be contracted later on, but you‚Äôre immune system hasn‚Äôt had the time to refine that response (like selecting for greater avidity). The result is those common childhood infections, or some that may not even produce symptoms, can be contracted and be much more severe and cause more serious complications.

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

Hey. No. That's not the whole story. 

Last spring/summer, hospitals and clinics cancelled everything that was elective, and prior to that, I had been under the impression that ""elective"" meant ""boob jobs,""'but it just means ""Well, you're not dying at this exact moment.""

I had a family member with a chronic condition whose appointments, diagnostic tests and routine preventative care were all cancelled. When their condition worsened (and like, who could have seen that coming?), they ended up needing to have major surgery.

It was also super hard to get treatment for certain conditions if the symptoms were also on the covid list. 

In my area, one hospital/clinic group determined that some facilities were No Covid and some were Covid. Primary care was generally classified as No Covid, which meant if you had any ""covid symptoms,"" you were not even allowed into the building where your primary care doctor practiced. You were yeeted directly to the Covid facility to be seen in urgent care. 

On the one hand, that completely makes sense, but since headache can be a symptom of high blood pressure, this meant that a patient with a documented history of high blood pressure whose BP was up and was experiencing headaches would be kicked to urgent care for Covid testing instead of being seen by a primary care doctor that is equipped to manage high blood pressure. 

Something similar to that happened to my spouse. They had a flare up of a well documented chronic condition that had *one* symptom that matched the covid list. They couldn't see their primary care provider in person because they couldn't enter the building, so they tried to set up a video visit. Nope. Because they had that *one* matching system, they were barred from video visits until the Covid facility cleared them. 

This resulted in the following delightful exchange: 

Dr: ""Your covid result was negative.""
Spouse: ""Yeah, I figured."" 
Dr: ""This appears to be a flare up of your chronic condition."" 
Spouse: ""Yeah, I figured.""
Dr. ""...Oh. Well, I can give you a week's worth of meds, but urgent care really isn't the best option for dealing with this. Why didn't you see your primary care?""
Spouse: ""They wouldn't let me in the door and sent me here. Because of the one covid symptom."" 
Dr: ""Oh. Well, that's...huh.""
Spouse: ""Yeah.""

So, again, I understand WHY the system was set up like that. It had some logical aspects, but I do feel like there's going to be a flood of worsening untreated chronic conditions and/or new late diagnoses as hospitals get back to normal.",,,1623357120,{},h1bo9wx,False,t3_nwtqgt,False,True,t3_nwtqgt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nwtqgt/us_deaths_from_heart_disease_and_diabetes_climbed/h1bo9wx/,1623578643,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; But you're saying that allowing more people to make X, would NOT increase the amount of X? Not sure that follows. I mean, your argument would make sense for iPhones, PlayStations, everything that requires raw materials, which is...(checks notes)...everything!

Actually this is very much the same as what is going on with electronics currently. They also suffer from a shortage of raw materials (semiconductors). That's why it has been so hard to get your hands on a new GPU or Playstation. Just allowing more companies to make GPUs wouldn't help, as the lack of semiconductors would still limit manufacturies.

Sure, the raw material shortage will *eventually* get fixed for both vaccines and electronics. The problem is just that it takes too long and doses are needed now, and just allowing more companies to fight for the limited resources does nothing for the immediate issues.

Not to mention the time it takes to set up these facilities. Even with huge resources it took experienced companies almost a year to set up the manufactory capacity we have today.

---

This pandemic is special as time is so important. Allowing more companies to produce the vaccines would eventually lead to more doses, but by that time there is likely no shortage of vaccines any more. Therefore it is better to focus on the more pressing issues.

Do you realize that determining a lack of increase in disease severity here is extremely important? Your baby the nature paper simply found an increase in mortality. They then used this as a basis for speculating that the variant could cause more severe illness. 

What the Lancet paper does is specifically refute that, and find that *no*, those hospitalized are not more sick than before. All we have to do is take a little moment to realize that if the hospital cohort is not becoming more ill (at all!), and that this is the cohort that would experience mortality, there is in-fact no increase in diseases severity or mortality. As such, we need to search for other reasons that the Nature article found what it did (spoilers, things like access to care can make a big difference). The lancet paper very robustly spells that out. 

You know how I know this is relevant? After those lancets papers (and a couple of others) the PHE stop considering B.1.1.7 to play
 a role in disease severity and progression.

I have no idea what your last paragraph is saying, why would the Nature authors refute their own findings lol.

If your immune system hasn't let you down, and you have drawn the conclusion that this somehow indicates invulnerability to viral illness, then why have you received other vaccinations?

You don't even need to plan! You can (or will soon be able to) just walk over to the pharmacy on your weekly shopping trip.

My main concern is with the CDC's timing on this. Here in California, *no one* 12-15 had time to get fully vaxxed - since they had only just become eligible, very few had a chance to get their first one. They do get COVID - and they also spread it.

Most of Sweden's 21 regions are currently vaccinating around ages 40+ or 50+, together with 18+ with comorbities and medical staff. The nationwide age distribution is currently

Age | First dose coverage | Full vaccination
---|---|----
18-29 | 10.51% | 4.73%
30-39 | 13.42% | 6.1%
40-49 | 29.02% | 7.64%
50-59 | 65.21% | 11.18%
60-69 | 86.14% | 35.57%
70-79 | 92.3% | 61.13%
80-89 | 93.23% | 85.86%
90+ | 90.63% | 84.19%

The national goal is that all adults should have been offered a first dose by Sep 5. The past 7 days a total of 637 107 doses have been administered, which is an average of 91 015 per day. Adjusted to US population this corresponds to 2.9m doses/day. Most vaccinations recently seem to be 2nd doses rather than 1st doses.

Around 600k doses of Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are currently being delivered weekly. A bit more than 16m doses is required to fully vaccinate all adults, i.e. around 10m additional doses are needed for that.
