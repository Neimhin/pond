It's not 100% clear from the press release, but as I read it, that entire 30k group (not just the vaccinated 15k) had 900 cases since then, including 100 severe cases.  That's further muddied by the fact that since then the placebo group was also offered shots and 98% got them, so at this point basically the whole 30k are vaccinated, but it's not clear what portion of those 900/100 cases happened before vaccination, after only 1 shot, or immediately after the second shot before the full effect was reached.

The way I read it is that most of these cases were in the unvaccinated participants, which is how they get their ~90% effectiveness numbers.

The study, led by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that in over 1,000 cases in which information about whether they got sick from their initial Covid-19 illness was available, 75 percent of the patients did not experience such symptoms. But two to five weeks later, they became sick enough to be hospitalized for the condition, called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), which can affect multiple organs, especially the heart.

Published Tuesday in JAMA Pediatrics, the study said that “most MIS-C illnesses are believed to result from asymptomatic or mild Covid-19” followed by a hyper-inflammatory response that appears to occur when the patients’ bodies have produced their maximum level of antibodies to the virus. Experts do not yet know why some young people, and a smaller number of [adults](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6940e1.htm), respond this way.

“It means primary-care pediatricians need to have a high index of suspicion for this because Covid is so prevalent in the society and children often have asymptomatic disease as their initial Covid infection,” said Dr. Jennifer Blumenthal, a pediatric intensivist and pediatric infectious disease specialist at Boston Children’s Hospital, who was not involved in the study.

 The researchers evaluated 1,733 of the 2,090 cases of the syndrome in people age 20 and younger that had been reported to the C.D.C. as of January. 

The findings show that although the syndrome is rare, it can be [serious](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/health/covid-children-inflammatory-syndrome.html). The C.D.C’s data only included patients who were hospitalized. Over 90 percent of those young people experienced symptoms involving at least four organ systems and 58 percent needed treatment in intensive care units.

Many experienced significant heart issues: over half developed low blood pressure, 37 percent developed cardiogenic shock and 31 percent experienced cardiac dysfunction involving their heart’s inability to pump adequately. The study said that a significantly higher percentage of patients who had not had Covid-19 symptoms experienced those heart problems, compared with those who had initial coronavirus symptoms. A greater percentage of initially asymptomatic patients also ended up in intensive care.

“Even the kids with severe MIS-C, who were in the I.C.U. — the vast majority of them did not have a preceding illness that they recognized,” said Dr. Roberta DeBiasi, chief of infectious diseases at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., who was not involved in the research.

The study provided the most detailed demographic and geographic picture of the syndrome to date. About 34 percent of the patients were Black and 37 percent were Hispanic, reflecting the way that the coronavirus has disproportionately affected members of those communities. As the pandemic went on, the authors wrote, the proportion of patients who were white increased, comprising 20 percent of all cases. People of Asian heritage comprised just over 1 percent of patients.

 Overall, nearly 58 percent of the patients were male, but the proportion was not the same across all ages. The youngest group — newborn to age 4 — had roughly equal numbers of boys and girls, and the male-to-female ratio increased in the older groups until it was more than two-to-one male to female in the 18-to-20 group. 

The vast majority of patients (nearly 86 percent) were younger than 15. The study found that those under 5 had the lowest risk of serious heart complications and were less likely to need intensive care. Patients 10 and older were significantly more likely to develop issues like shock, low blood pressure and myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle).

“I think that’s similar to what we saw with Covid, that the older kids seemed to have more severe disease,” Dr. DeBiasi said. “And that’s because what makes people really sick from the Covid is the inflammatory aspect of it, so maybe these older kids, for whatever reasons, make more inflammation, whether that’s in primary Covid or MIS-C.”

Still, significant numbers of the youngest patients developed heart problems. In the newborn-to-4 age group, 36 percent had low blood pressure, 25 percent had shock and 44 percent were treated in the I.C.U.

Patients of all ages in the study had about the same occurrence of some of the less-common heart issues linked to the syndrome, including coronary aneurysms and fluid buildup. Children 14 and under were more likely to have rash and red eyes, while those older than 14 were more likely to have chest pain, shortness of breath and cough. Abdominal pain and vomiting afflicted about two-thirds of all patients.

There were 24 deaths recorded, spread across all age groups. There was no information in the study about whether patients had underlying medical conditions, but doctors and researchers have reported that young people with MIS-C were often [previously healthy](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/health/covid-kids-severe-inflammatory-syndrome.html) and significantly more likely to be healthy than the relatively small number of young people who become seriously ill from initial Covid infections.

Of the 1,075 patients for whom information about initial Covid illness was available, only 265 had symptoms at that time. They were more likely to be older — their median age was 11, while the median age of those with asymptomatic Covid infections was 8. But that could be because “younger children can’t express their concerns as well,” said Dr. Blumenthal, who co-wrote [an editorial about the study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2778429?guestAccessKey=145e1ae6-2d09-4378-897a-90dc868ec13e&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=040621#editorial-comment-tab).",,,1618384498,{},gugos18,True,t3_mqldpf,False,True,t3_mqldpf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mqldpf/many_children_with_serious_inflammatory_syndrome/gugos18/,1618384509,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

However, I think using clots to compare risks certainly causes a lot of confusion among readers. For putting risk into perspective it might be better to choose a completely different ailment. 

Thanks for the data on the birth control risks. Indeed from reading the links, I see that the risk is either comparable, or slightly higher for birth control. That definitely depends a lot on how the 25% fatality rate value remains stable.  Alarming that if we fill a large baseball stadium with women taking birth control, we essentially kill one individual per year. Hopefully some progress is made on that issue! 

I think there is a disconnect from risks calculated by policy makers, and the risks from an individual perspective. As an individual, I understand the risk from the adenovirus vaccines is still low, but I also have alternatives that will be available without that known risk if I wait a little bit. The personal calculation is comparing to the risk of catching and dying from Covid. Firstly, as a young person the risk of dying is low, or somewhat comparable to the risks from the JJ or AZ vaccines. When multiplies by the risk of catching the virus the risk from Covid is then much lower. Then, I can have the power control by personal behaviour to lower my risk of contracting covid even more than the statistical average. Its the same with driving. There are freak accidents, but I can also control my driving behaviour to make my risk of crashing or dieing lower than the statistical average.  So in considering risks from a personal perspective it seems logical to wait for a safer alternative in my position. 

However, I also understand we as a society need to end the pandemic as soon as possible. So if I wait two more months for an mRNA vaccine, how many lives do I personally save? I could also achieve the same result by monitoring my personal behaviour to not catch and spread the virus over the next two months. If we all run ahead and all get the vaccine, essentially \~ 1 in 600 000 young people will end up being martyrs for society.  Maybe from a public policy perspective that makes sense, but from an individual perspective where I can modify my personal behaviour and get another vaccine in a few short months, it doesn't.

and here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21070/

A commonly known example of adaptive immunity is with pregnancy of mothers with Rhesus negative blood type and children with Rhesus positive blood type. The mother's blood only came into contact with the child's blood during birth. The IgM antibodies immediately produced could not cross the placenta barrier to attack the child, so the first child is OK. But the B cells of the mother has remembered the antigen of the Rhesus positive child's blood. As a result, the next time the mother is pregnant with a Rhesus positive child, the B cells memory will activate the IgG antibody and attack the child. In other immune responses, the second exposure will trigger higher level of immune responses through the adaptive immunity response.

In science, nothing is proven.  You make a falsifiable hypothesis, and you either prove it false or you gain confidence in your hypothesis.

&gt;Not gonna be able to do that with a tiny ass sample size, and over the next couple weeks you're gonna get that data whether you like it or not.

I'm not like... against gather data, and as soon as a single man dies the hypothesis is dead.  That's literally what I'm advocating.

&gt;You cant say the risk is 0 just because your questionable as fuck hypothesis says so. 

You can only say what the data tells you.  If there exists data that shows there is a risk to men, then we go by that.  If no data yet exists, then you assume no risk until there is evidence that says otherwise.

&gt;Thats how people die.

Not giving people the vaccine because of a perceived risk without any evidence is also how people die... of covid.  You know people are LITERALLY dying of covid?  That is fact.  

&gt;Potentially killing men who could have taken an alternative vaccine because the risk wasnt yet falsifiable enough for you is idiotic.

Based on how you used the word here, I don't think you understand what falsifiable means.

&gt;Your falsifiable hypothesis is relies on an assumption you cannot make with any sort of confidence, the assumption that the individuals being women was an exclusive cause for the side effect

I really feel like you don't understand what a hypothesis is either...

&gt;'Men are not affected because so far only women have been' is not science.

Yes it is.  It is making observations and creating falsifiable models on those observations that either improve in confidence or are proven wrong.

&gt;Youre attempting to base some 'scientific fact' on nothing but correlation. If the first 10 people to die of covid complications all happened to be women (maybe all women with severe prexisting conditions you cant see) and you said ""well you cant say that men need to worry about that because that isnt falsifiable"", do you think you sound Intelligent?

&gt;	CDC will convene a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on Wednesday to further review these cases and assess their potential significance. FDA will review that analysis as it also investigates these cases. Until that process is complete, we are recommending a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution. This is important, in part, to ensure that the health care provider community is aware of the potential for these adverse events and can plan for proper recognition and management due to the unique treatment required with this type of blood clot.

&gt;Right now, these adverse events appear to be extremely rare. COVID-19 vaccine safety is a top priority for the federal government, and we take all reports of health problems following COVID-19 vaccination very seriously. People who have received the J&amp;J vaccine who develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath within three weeks after vaccination should contact their health care provider. 


I feel like it reflects my general opinion in this thread. It’s enough of an occurrence to warrant a proper review. A short halt while they review the issue will do plenty of good for public perception. A short halt will not make a considerable impact on vaccination rates as we are already ahead of the expected schedule.

My understanding is that the best course of action if you think you are having a true adverse reaction to a vaccine to go to primary physician (if you have one) or find a doctor to evaluate you.

Ultimately the reason that phase 3 trials are so large is because a) you typically need a large group to evaluate efficacy and b) outside the trial where there is a control group and non control group *it is *really* hard to link ""reactions"" you might have to the vaccine. Not saying they don't happen because they absolutely do (look at the J&amp;J vaccine - ironically one that I trialed). And actually our mass vaccination is acting as a type of trial since everyone being vaccinated all at once makes it easier to make connections (ie. if those 8 women had gotten the vaccines a year apart it would be harder to make the connection that it came from J&amp;J)

But to answer your question - if you are showing typical symptoms - rash/hurt arm/fever/headache... etc... no it likely won't or doesn't need to be reported - these are expected. Outside typical symptoms you would likely need a medical professional to ""vouch"" that they believe whatever reaction you are having is due to the vaccine.

Once you narrow it down to the subset of the population who seems to be most at risk, i.e. women under 40. And even then J&amp;J just started the rollout, so the actual number might still rise in the upcoming days - similar to AZ which also started with a ""one in a million"" probability and after a few days the numbers showed a different picture - [Norway had five cases amongst 130000 AZ vaccines \(1:25000\), three of whom died, in Germany it was 1:100000](https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/coronavirus_vipitguidance.pdf) - and that's amongst a group that has negligible risk to die from Covid. &gt; In the UK alone, COVID-19 has killed hundreds of people under 30.

There have been 27 women younger than 30 years (77 &lt;40 years) in total who died of covid in Germany so far.

There have been ~510000 confirmed infections of women &lt; 35 years in Germany. 

Unfortunately I can't quickly find a dataset with matching age groups, but even with the conservative estimate (deaths amongst women &lt;40yo, infections &lt;35 yo) you only get to 

77/510000=.00015

And that's not even considering the undiagnosed Covid cases. Looking at that those numbers makes the choice between ""AZ vaccine"" and ""no vaccine"" not as obvious on an individual level - and that's not even the choice that needs to be made: there are other vaccines available, so a viable solution (if the current numbers are correct) could be to vaccinate men and older people with AZ/J&amp;J and reserve Biontech-Pfizer for women &lt; 40",,,1618381633,{},gugli1z,False,t3_mpzwzj,False,True,t1_gug69ji,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mpzwzj/us_calls_for_pause_on_johnson_johnson_vaccine/gugli1z/,1618381643,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

[],,jdorje,,,,[],,,,text,t2_ii7rl,False,False,[],"The currently used mRNA vaccines are functionally identical.  They just have simple mRNA code to build a protein: the classic prefusion-locked spike protein.  Moderna's is a 100𝜇g dose while BNT is only 30 𝜇g, and they also use different lipid shells for the mRNA, both of which require freezing at slightly different temperatures.

Moderna is working on several different ""upgrades"" in parallel. They have a new lipid shell that would be refrigerator-stable, a B.1.351 spike, a multivalent spike (I think this just is a mix of both vaccines basically, but it could be a slightly more complex piece of code to make both proteins), and a RBD+NTD-only spike.  These are all in various levels of trial, but sadly not hugely big ones as we really should be doing.  BNT hasn't made similar announcements but it's a safe bet they're working on the same things.

A central question should be dosage.  The 30 and 100 𝜇g doses were chosen to really make sure they work, and clearly they do.  But if we could do 10 𝜇g doses we'd instantly jump from hundreds of millions of doses a month to quite a few billions.  Again, we should be doing large trials of this, but it appears we aren't.

There's also a CureVac mRNA vaccine currently in trials that is a bit different: it has both spike and nucleocapsid proteins.  It'll be interesting to see the results of this - it could be either the best vaccine we have or the worst.

I assume this ARCoV vaccine is simply a copy of the so-called open source mRNA code used by BNT and Moderna, but I haven't seen confirmation.  Hopefully it uses the locked prefusion spike.

mRNA coding is entirely in its infancy, and the only program we currently know how to write is ""make this protein"".

I enjoy taking the pill. I feel low-risk for unwanted pregnancy, I am less burdened by my periods and can use the pill to skip my periods if they come at an inconvenient time, and I can still get my periods because I feel less anxious when I have monthly validation that my birth control methods are working!

I do worry sometimes about long-term side effects of being on the pill, but at this point I cannot know the future, all I know is the cost-benefits of what I am experiencing now, and I’m really enjoying the control I feel that I have.

I hope to be married in the next few years and ready to come off the birth control, to start trying for kids. Once I’m done having kids, I’ll see where my body is at, if my periods are manageable, I’ll probably ask my husband to get a vasectomy, or explore other options of birth control.

One reason the heterelogous prime boost combination of adenoviral vaccine with an mRNA may be especially well suited

The results demonstrated here correlates with the previously realized large-scale real world data in similar age groups showing that AZ seemed to induce  higher protection against hospitilization than Pfizer/BionTech ( both are compared at one dose) 

Four weeks after a person had the first dose of the Oxford jab, scientists in Scotland found it reduced hospital admissions by 94 per cent.  Those who received the Pfizer jab were 85 per cent less likely to be admitted to hospital (sample size 1.14 million vaccinees)

We arrive with this at quite an interesting junction, whereas on the one hand currently  AZ or adenovirus vaccines in general are represented as second rate or subpar and restricted to be administered to some countries across all age groups on a population scale because of individual-level signals of heightened risk in certain age groups;  however in terms of net reduction in illness in high spread environment (at least against ancestral/b117 lineage)

 country-scale the real world data might actually play out that AZ vaccinated cohort may be *less* likely overall to be hospitilized, even if they're more likely to become infected, confounding the  cost-benefit-analyis somewhat.

From the study:

&gt; Epidemics generally spread through a succession of waves that reflect factors on multiple timescales. 

&gt; On short timescales, superspreading events lead to burstiness and overdispersion, whereas long-term persistent heterogeneity in susceptibility is expected to lead to a reduction in both the infection peak and the herd immunity threshold (HIT). 

&gt; Here, we develop a general approach to encompass both timescales, including time variations in individual social activity, and demonstrate how to incorporate them phenomenologically into a wide class of epidemiological models through reparameterization. We derive a nonlinear dependence of the effective reproduction number Re on the susceptible population fraction S. 

&gt; We show that a state of transient collective immunity (TCI) emerges well below the HIT during early, high-paced stages of the epidemic. 


&gt; However, this is a fragile state that wanes over time due to changing levels of social activity, and so the infection peak is not an indication of long-lasting herd immunity: Subsequent waves may emerge due to behavioral changes in the population, driven by, for example, seasonal factors. 

&gt; Transient and long-term levels of heterogeneity are estimated using empirical data from the COVID-19 epidemic and from real-life face-to-face contact networks. These results suggest that the hardest hit areas, such as New York City, have achieved TCI following the first wave of the epidemic, but likely remain below the long-term HIT. Thus, in contrast to some previous claims, these regions can still experience subsequent waves.",,,1618405786,{},guheupc,False,t3_mqptsg,False,True,t3_mqptsg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mqptsg/suppression_of_covid19_waves_reflects/guheupc/,1618405830,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

Katalin Karikó &amp; Drew Weissman published research around a key mRNA breakthrough around 2005 while at University of Pennsylvania. Their work was a new bioengineering method that made mRNA delivery at all possible. Years before this pandemic, 2 companies licensed that work, one is Moderna (US) and the other is BioNTech (DE), with the purpose of using it in practical medical applications. mRNA could theoretically be used for a slew of purposes &amp; vaccines were far from the only option (e.g. BioNTech hired Karikó &amp; was aiming, for years, at cancer therapy).  

When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, BioNTech &amp; Moderna were in pole position to attempt developing a mRNA vaccine and that is exactly what they did, independent from each other, one in US &amp; the other in DE.  

BioNTech made their vaccine in a matter of weeks but they are an inventor of new bioengineering products and not a mass manufacturer. This is where Pfizer comes in.  

Pfizer handled global trials for the BioNTech vaccine, something that the latter has no experience with at a global level &amp; at neck breaking speeds, and then Pfizer also handled mass manufacturing, something that's again an immense undertaking far FAR outside of what BioNTech does.

### Half of people in England likely to have Covid antibodies - ONS

An  estimated one in two people in England have antibodies to the  coronavirus, according to a sample of the population in the week ending  28 March.

This figure is largely unchanged from the previous two weeks.

Antibodies  against Covid can be found in the body after either a past infection or  somebody had been vaccinated. They are proteins in the blood that  recognise specific infections and fight them off.

According to the Office for National Statistics, in England an estimated 54.9% of the population would have tested positive for      antibodies in a blood test in the week ending 28 March,

This number was 49.1% in Wales, 54.5% in Northern Ireland and 46% in Scotland.

The ONS said the figures varied across regions, with the West Midlands having the highest percentage of antibody      positivity in England, and the North East had the lowest.

“There is a clear pattern between vaccination and testing positive for antibodies, however the detection of antibodies alone is not a precise measure of protection granted by vaccines,"" said the ONS.

“It is possible that antibody levels in some people are now too low to be detected by our tests but still high enough to grant a level of protection.""",,,1618395890,{},guh0gn5,True,t3_mqnonk,False,True,t3_mqnonk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mqnonk/infection_survey_antibody_and_vaccination_data/guh0gn5/,1618395901,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

Cases?  Why would you use the word cases?  That has a pretty specific meaning and for anyone not clicking through, it's going to be confusing as hell.

How many deaths out of the other 3.5M+ *cases*[sic] in Oregon in that same time period?  Maybe 200?  Pretty hard to actually form up an accurate comparison because I don't feel like doing calculus on the vaccinated persons curve.

So, we'll just go with 200.  That's the number of deaths from the March 1st to April 8th.  Vaccinations completed prior to Jan 18th/Jan 25th (42/35 days prior to March 1st) were basically negligible.

So that puts the equivalent unvaccinated number at 0.0057%.  So, 2 orders of magnitude bigger, but still also basically nothing?

A number that if you substituted into your post and pretended it was the accurate number, would elicit an identical response from people as your number. 


But that numbers apples and oranges because we are assuming that 700k Oregonians received their first dose by Feb 18th.   Which, obviously, didn't happen.

Let's look at a different number:  14500.  It's not a huge number.  But it's not nothing.  That's what I get when I take your 4.3 x 10^-6 and multiply by 12 (months of the year), the US population, and 0.85 (amount of people who will get vaccinated).

That's the number of vaccinated people who will die in this country using your calculated number.  It's not a perfect number, but I think it makes the point that this ""stop worrying about your neighbor"" thing has it's flaws.

This disease will still spread without hard pushes from the government, private businesses, and individuals across this country.  It will still kill vaccinated people, so, yeah, I'm going to ""worry about my neighbor,"" because if he gets vaccinated, it's going to create better outcomes for all of us.",,,1618423147,{},guihl7v,False,t3_mqc1y8,False,True,t1_guid5gt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mqc1y8/nfl_to_bar_unvaccinated_coaches_from_working_with/guihl7v/,1618428181,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

The highest dose hormonal IUD is called Mirena and it is actually an FDA approved treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding. My doctor recommended it to me specifically BECAUSE I had bad periods. The reduced cramping and bleeding benefits with a hormonal IUD can be stronger than with other types of hormonal birth control because the hormones are released directly into uterine tissue.

I totally agree with your point that women shouldn’t tout the benefits of their birth control without acknowledging that other women have different experiences though. For instance I have had friends who described their IUD insertion as a piece of cake and claim it’s all overhyped, but mine was horrible and the pain lasted for 48 hours afterwards.

To mirror what zeeke said, the tests in New York in April 2020 vs. 2021 is staggering. I think there's a few points to keep in mind.

Despite vaccines being pumped out, it doesn't mean we're just gonna STOP seeing cases. Young people are the last to get vaccinated. It was a successful roll-out plan, as those who were immunocompromised or older (and the most at risk) got the shots first. It helped weather the storm, but doesn't mean young people CAN'T get seriously sick or catch the virus.

Think of those who aren't vaccinated yet. Young people, those who can't get appointments, and anti-vaxxers/those who don't want the vaccine. Young people are in college or high school, going to parties (at least around me) and returning to their normal lives—even without the vaccine. The overall consensus amongst people I know is that ""my parent(s) and grandparent(s) are vaccinated - so I don't feel so guilty going out with friends...""

Anti-vaxxers or those who don't want the vaccine or trust it yet—yes, they're different groups of people—have the viewpoint as ""I'm ready to go back to normal life."" They're not getting the vaccine, so there's no finish line. They've returned to normal life.

These are the people still catching the virus or still at risk. Now, just because you're 28 and healthy doesn't mean you can't get a serious case of COVID. I know an otherwise healthy 40-something year old who couldn't get an appointment yet. He used to smoke, caught COVID, and is now in ICU.

Conversely, let's say you're a healthy 20-something year old. You catch COVID and get a bad fever... or you get bad anxiety and have trouble breathing. You go to the hospital. Now, you can literally check out an hour later after getting an IV or calming down... but they're still recording it as a COVID hospitalization.

So I guess my overall point is that COVID is still a thing... there's people still catching it... young people **are** still at risk and there will still be cases. But the numbers don't always tell the entire story and there is a good degree of sensationalism by the media. Michigan - very much in a bad place right now. NY a month or so ago?

Great point. I didn't specifically mention this but it is one of the things that I used to justify lowering my estimate range (500k to 1M) rather than keep the 1M at the middle of the range. 

&gt;a larger percentage of younger people who have been vaccinated already will be people who were priority for things like their job (healthcare workers, etc). As they were also first in line for vaccination, a lot of them will have been vaccinated with the mRNA vaccines before J&amp;J was available.

Correct. This is why I didn't go with the another way of estimating the vaccination numbers which would have involved getting numbers for total female teachers and health care workers first. This other method would have been more susceptible to the dates of vaccine approval. Overall, however, I agree that young women would be more likely to get J&amp;J than older women. 

&gt;Bottom line: we are making a lot of assumptions, even if they seem like reasonable ones. It would be nice to have official numbers.

Yes, but Fermi approximations (the estimation method we are discussing) are shockingly accurate despite a lack of precision. We will be getting official numbers soon but, for now, it's fair to say that the 6 pathological cases are from no less than 500,000 total cases in the relevant age group. 1 in 83,000 young women are potentially vulnerable. It could be less and, given the small number of cases (6 isn't significantly different from 8 or 4), it could be more.

However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

I would also expect that when data is aggregated, the researchers also compare the incidence of a specific event occurring in patients to the incidence in the general population.

And no, doctors don’t know what to look for and how to treat it for this specifically.

200k doses of AZ/month doesn’t really make a difference. Pfizer is nearly replacing the AZ supply with additional supply (Should be an additional ~500k to Norway in Q2 on top of the original order). 

No point in taking the risk when the overall impact on the vaccination schedule is low and the remaining unvaccinated population is young. I think it is a better idea to share it with EU nations who wants them and will use them, but due to the low volume it won’t make much of a difference.

The first appointments were minutes away. Then, at 7:23 a.m. on Tuesday, news of the pause in Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccinations reached Youngstown State University.

&gt;”We were ready to go,” said Shannon Tirone, an associate vice president at the university, in eastern Ohio, who instead started calling students to tell them they would not be able to get the vaccine after all.

&gt;Similar scenes played out across the country as the abrupt halt in the use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine because of concerns about potential blood clots upended plans to vaccinate some of the country’s hardest-to-reach populations.

&gt;In California, mobile vaccine clinics in rural areas were canceled. In Chicago, vaccination events for restaurant employees and aviation workers were postponed indefinitely. And at colleges in Ohio, New York and Tennessee, where the one-dose vaccine offered a chance to quickly inoculate students before they left campus for the summer, appointments were called off en masse.

it seems you have cherrypicked some statistics a little to highlight the narrarive  maternal death statistics you shared for example  must not be used as direct evidence of medical racism. The same pattern is observed in other countries and multiple explanations have been offered that don't implicate racism as being the explanation : We can see for example Chinese in US or UK (where most healthcare staff are 'minority)  have lowest maternal death rate per 100,000, almost half the rate of white.

There are a number of conditions, e.g types of cancer where black people have much better diagnosis and survival rates vs others (e.g white) 

I know you are speaking of America only-- but respectfully and without trying to be patronizing  want to remind that there are  ~200 other countries in the world. in my country many of the doctors and healthcare workers are Black, senior positions at facilities and hospitals some of the same mortality patterns exist, so it becomes a little more awkward to blame racist only for healthcare disparities and for vaccine uptake

&gt; ""Essentially, these are cases that you see amongst vaccinated individuals during a period in which you expect the vaccines to work,"" says Dr. Saad Omer, a vaccine researcher at Yale University. This incomplete protection that some people experience occurs to some extent with a vaccine against any disease.

&gt; The three vaccines authorized for use against COVID-19 in the United States appear to be at least 94% effective at preventing severe disease and death (starting about two weeks after a person is fully vaccinated), according to data reported so far, and about 80% effective at preventing infection. But that's not 100%, Omer notes, so a relatively small number of infections despite immunization with these very effective vaccines is to be expected.

&gt; ""So the bottom line is: It's expected. No need to freak out,"" Omer says.

...

&gt; ""There's nothing there yet that's a red flag. We obviously are going to keep an eye on that very, very carefully. But I don't see anything that changes our concept of the vaccine and its efficacy,"" Fauci says.

&gt; And it's definitely no reason for anyone not to get vaccinated. The opposite is true.

&gt; ""It would also appear the rare infections that occur are less severe, so it would also protect us against severe disease, which is great,"" says Dr. Francesca Torriani, an infectious disease researcher at the University of California San Diego, who has studied breakthrough infections among health care workers.

&gt; But such cases are a reminder of why it's important for people to continue being vigilant after getting vaccinated, infectious disease experts say.

&gt; ""I would encourage people to continue, once they're vaccinated, to use all the prevention measures that we've been talking about when they're outside their home, including masking and distancing and whatnot. And all of that should be active in the workplace,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, said during a briefing for the press on Monday.",,,1618405265,{},guhdwil,False,t3_mqpuj8,False,True,t3_mqpuj8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mqpuj8/cdc_studies_breakthrough_covid_cases_among_people/guhdwil/,1618405281,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

""Pfizer and Moderna are new techs, JnJ is old tech"" (wrong - viral vector vaccines are practically as new as mRNA). ""All vaccines are 100% effective against severe disease, hospitalization, and death."" - wrong, and an artifact the small case numbers (and Moderna had two hospitalizations in its trial group). 

Someone in another thread was trying to argue that Sinovac (which is *probably* the least effective vaccine currently being used globally) was 100% effective against severe disease because of a trial that had a 56-100% confidence interval. 

It's disappointing as these vaccines - especially the mRNA ones - are so effective that there's no need to lie about efficacy. They're anywhere from 87%-99% (unlikely to be 99%; that is from an Israel MoH study that has a confounding variable of risk exposure differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations) protective against severe disease and hospitalization in real world use. That's crazy good, especially when pared with high effectiveness against asymptomatic spread and even mild symptomatic disease. 

Saying they're 100% effective is counterproductive for two key reasons: 
1) It gives anti-vaxxers an excuse not to get vaccinated. ""Well, if it's 100% effective against hospitalization and death, then I have no obligation to get it."" When it is less than 100% effective, it emphasizes the importance of achieving herd immunity to reduce harm - even in those who are vaccinated.  
and then seeing the headlines that someone died from COVID after having the vaccine will just enforce 
2) When the inevitable headlines arrive of the tragedy of someone dying from COVID after getting vaccinated, it leads to a mindset of ""they lied about vaccine effectiveness! what else are they lying about?""

That's why they said ""it may"".

B117 and B1351 are both variants that natural immunity probably protects against. Natural immunity very likely does not work against P1 to a significant degree, considering a recent study showed that it very likely reinfected a large portion of people who had recently been infected.

Also..

[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.26.21252554v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.26.21252554v1)

&gt;Using a two-category dynamical model that integrates genomic and mortality data, we estimate that P.1 may be 1.4–2.2 times more transmissible and 25-61% more likely to evade protective immunity elicited by previous infection with non-P.1 lineages. 

AND

[https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2102017](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2102017) 

&gt;**Thus, as compared with neutralization of USA-WA1/2020, neutralization of B.1.1.7-spike and P.1-spike viruses was roughly equivalent, and neutralization of B.1.351-spike virus was robust but lower.** Our data are also consistent with lower neutralization titers against the virus with the full set of B.1.351-spike mutations than against virus with either subset of mutations. Our findings also suggest that mutations that result in amino acid substitutions K417N, E484K, and N501Y in the receptor-binding site have a greater effect on neutralization than the 242–244 deletion affecting the N-terminal domain of the spike protein. 

So yes, P1 does avoid some natural immunity based on the evidence that we have, and based on the tests that we've seen, P1 is neutralized enough by the current vaccines to warrant it's usage. It's a major reason why the CDC is encouraging everyone to vaccinate even if you were previously infected.

It’s not “might have worked” they absolutely did work. If they didn’t work we would have a higher death rate than Texas but we don’t. We have a lower death rate with a higher population, one state had mask mandates and lockdowns, the other didn’t as much as the other state. Again 10% is huge you know why? Because every single life is valuable and the science absolutely is the way to follow just because you don’t like saying doesn’t make it not true. You’re right I don’t have a degree in science but the medical advisors for California do and often multiple PHD’s so I’ll listen to them over a random person. Thank you very much. No changing the subject right? So you admit that the lockdowns and mask mandates do work you yourself just said they lowered the death rate by 10%. It’s not “might” there is no other factor. Obesity is a rampant issue in the entire country not just Texas, you can shout into the void all you want but that doesn’t change the fact that lockdowns and mask mandates saved lives. That will have been always worth it. Nearly  7,000 more lives compared to Texas approach. Texas has a shit government, wanna know why? When the state that is the most populous in the union with 10 million more people has less deaths per capita than one state with 10 million less people that’s how you know Texas has a shit government.

The lockdowns and mask mandates ""worked"" as in they *might* have lowered the deaths/population by 10%.

The reason I ask is that this seems to be arguing that the vaccine should not be given if there is any risk at all from it. But that is irrational. This not a world where there is no downside to not having the vaccine. The risk is that you get a Covid infection, and in the UK that risk is generally higher than the risk from the vaccine.

The UK regulators decided to continue to recommend the AZ vaccine to people over 30 because - given the current situation with regard to the prevalence of the virus, and the current vaccine supply situation - having the vaccine was safer than not having it. 

In the countries you mentioned, the prevalence of new Covid cases is much higher than the UK. Per million population, the new case numbers are roughly 5x higher in Norway and 10x higher in Germany and Austria. So the risk of not having the vaccine is 5x or 10x higher than in the UK, whereas the risk from the vaccine is of course the same.

Of course, if these countries have such huge supplies of other vaccines that they don't need to use AZ at all, and can do so without delaying the vaccination programme, then of course they should. In that case the risk of not having the AZ vaccine is zero. (This may approximate the situation in some parts of the USA.)

&gt;	Researchers are ramping up efforts to figure out why some vaccines protect for mere weeks but others work for life. “We simply don’t know what the rules are to inducing long-lasting immunity,” says Plotkin, who began to research vaccines in 1957. “For years, we were making vaccines without a really deep knowledge of immunology. Everything of course depends on immunologic memory, and we have not systematically measured it.”
&gt;
&gt;Bali Pulendran, an immunologist at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, has reached the same frustrating conclusion about vaccine durability. “I keep saying, ‘It’s not well understood, it’s not well understood.’ This is one of the major issues in vaccines.”

Taipei, April 14 (CNA) Taiwan on Wednesday reported five new imported cases of COVID-19 and revoked Cambodia's designation as being a country of low-to-moderate risk from the disease.

Two of the cases involved migrant workers from the Philippines, one of whom is a woman in her 20s and the other man in his 30s. They tested positive for COVID-19 during or just after finishing quarantine, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said.

Two other cases, a British man in his 40s and a Taiwanese man in his 70s, also tested positive during quarantine, the CECC said.

The final case reported Wednesday involved a Russian man in his 40s, who was infected with COVID-19 when he was still in Russia in December, but arrived in Taiwan with a negative test taken three days before departure, according to the CECC.

The man traveled to Taiwan in late January and began working on a ship on Feb. 4. He was at sea until April 11 and did not stop at any other ports before returning to Taiwan, the CECC said.

On April 12, he took a self-paid COVID-19 test at a hospital, and the result came back positive on Wednesday.

To date, Taiwan has recorded 1,067 cases of COVID-19, 951 of which have been classified as imported. Of the total, 1,029 have recovered, 11 have died and 27 are in hospital, according to CECC statistics as of Wednesday.

Globally, COVID-19 has infected over 137 million people in 193 countries and regions, with more than 2.9 million fatalities, CECC data shows.

Also on Wednesday, Chen said the CECC has revoked Cambodia's status as being of low-to-moderate risk for COVID-19 because the country has recently seen an increase in case numbers.

In Taiwan, business travelers from countries deemed to be at low-to-moderate or low-risk for COVID-19 can apply to be quarantined for fewer than the normal 14 days, as long as they take a self-paid COVID-19 test at the end of the quarantine period and it comes back negative.

Those from low-risk countries can apply to have their quarantine lifted on the fifth day after their arrival, while those from low-to-moderate risk countries can do so after seven days.

The current list of countries and regions the CECC deems to be at low risk of COVID-19 are New Zealand, Macau, Palau, Fiji, Brunei, Laos, Nauru, the Marshall Islands, Bhutan, Australia, Singapore and Vietnam.

Hong Kong is listed as being of low-to-moderate risk.",,,1618429326,{},guivhhv,True,t3_mqy8s2,False,True,t3_mqy8s2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mqy8s2/taiwan_confirms_five_new_imported_covid19_cases/guivhhv/,1618436169,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

In other words, we'll have annual COVID waves, possibly indefinitely, and vaccinated people will get sick because they would be forced to roll the dice by being exposed to unvaccinated people all the time.

If we get closer to 75-80% vaccination, most epidemiologists seem to think we'll avoid this fate altogether. It's the difference between annual COVID for all of society and herd immunity.

And before you say ""it's no big deal, it'll just be the sniffles for the vaccinated people"", in the 50% scenario we are creating a perpetual petri dish for new mutations that escape the vaccines (and not by like 10% like the South African variant, but much more than that). It would be a matter of ***when, not if, the vaccines stop working***.

I'm not saying it's a justification for perpetual closure of society. I'm saying that there's a huge difference between 50% and 80%.

There are plenty of RNases and DNases floating around in cells and in the cell-free fraction of the plasma, so all the RNA and DNA will be degraded pretty rapidly -- we're talking hours to days at *most*. Any of the small bits of RNA or any DNA just won't do anything -- the body and the cell has more than enough defense mechanisms to prevent random pieces of RNA or DNA from being able to cause any trouble. And again, they get degraded so rapidly that they wouldn't have a chance to have any impact.

So in that case, what we're really thinking about is an autoimmune reaction -- but there's a few points to be made there. First, autoimmune reactions don't present way after the initial trigger; they virtually always present within 2-6 weeks of the inciting event. The reason for that is simple -- the autoimmune reaction is going to be strongest (if it happens at all) early in the immune response because that's when the immune response is going to be strongest. It's not as if the immune response is suddenly going to increase itself without a reason in the future; that would be incredibly inefficient for the body, so that's pretty strongly regulated by the immune system.

Basically, as someone that actually studies both medicine and molecular biology, I have not seen a *single* plausible explanation as to how mRNA vaccines could cause effects way down the line. The molecular biology of mRNA is a very mature field -- literally close to 60 years old at this point -- and we have a really good understanding of how the mRNA is going to be handled by the cells and how it's going to be degraded quickly. Similarly, we have a very good understanding of temporal dynamics of autoimmune triggers, and the notion that mRNA vaccines will trigger something way down the line simply is neither compatible with the data or with the basics of cell biology and medicine.

That doesn’t mean expertise doesn’t matter. It just means it has its limitations and sometimes the experts are only looking at it from one perspective. 

If covid was 100x deadlier than it is, I think we can all agree that a pause for such a vanishingly rare side effect would be ridiculous. So any suggestion that we have to pause because that’s the process and not doing so is anti-science is wrong on the face of it. This is a political decision and we absolutely have to weigh the alternative: that more people will die from covid because of this decision. 

I also reject the idea that there were only 2 approaches: pause the vaccine or do no investigation. A middle ground was possible here: say there is an extremely rare but dangerous  side effect that we are investigating, but given the severity of the pandemic and the rarity of this side effect, we are continuing to vaccinate while we conduct our investigation. That path would admit to the public  that there is a potential problem but also note that we are in a pandemic and so we need to keep vaccinating. 

This actually reminds me a lot of the different decisions the US and UK made about whether to wait on second doses. People on this sub were VEHEMENT that following the stage 3 trial protocols exactly was the only way, and that anything else was anti science. But the UK’s approach has turned out to be far better. They made an educated guess based on everything they knew about immunology and were right. I would suggest that given the millions of people who have received the J&amp;J vaccine, that we can make an educated guess that continuing to vaccinate will save many more lives than a pause will, and we can do so in a transparent way that lets people opt out of receiving that particular vaccine while the investigation is done.",,,1618371828,{},gug846x,False,t3_mq2cwz,False,True,t1_gudjhr9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mq2cwz/johnson_johnson_statement_on_covid19_vaccine/gug846x/,1618372011,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

The ""header"" of the mRNA code also falsely indicates the mRNA is from the nucleus and is of high importance, triggering the ribosomes to really crank out the spike proteins and at top priority. 

Moderna may have done these tricks as well, but I haven't seen confirmation of that.

The population of the UK is about 67.9 million and that of Norway is about 5.4 million \[[source](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/)\]. So the UK has about 12.5x as many people as Norway.

All the following figures are the latest available rolling 7-day averages.

* Daily new cases, April 13th \[[source](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases)\]: UK 1681, Norway 694. UK 2.4x.
* Daily new tests, April 11th \[[source](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=40..latest&amp;pickerSort=asc&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;Metric=Tests&amp;Interval=7-day+rolling+average&amp;Relative+to+Population=false&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=GBR~NOR)\]: UK 892,540; Norway 20,642. UK 42x.

I don't know where you get your ideas for the numbers of new cases, but they are very, very wrong. Norway is about 7x the number you said; the UK is about 1/2 the number you said.

Obviously it's impossible to know how many infections are not being recorded (e.g. because they are asymptomatic). But the more tests a country does, the fewer cases slip through the testing. The UK is doing 42x as many tests as Norway, with only 12.5x as many people. Per million people, we are doing over 13,000 each day and Norway is doing less than 4,000 each day. It's not quite 4x as many but it's about 3½ times as many. That means that the lower case numbers in the UK are not caused by a lack of testing. 

Figures for deaths are not relevant to this discussion, because they are determined by how many people were getting infected 4 weeks ago or more. In the UK it was very bad in January and February, and so there are still a lot of people dying compared to Norway.

I've been waiting for a autoimmune effect to happen though.

Mostly because the very very basics are that the vaccine carries RNA which will get absorbed by a cell, then the cells ribosomes read the RNA, and make coronavirus' spike protein. This will cause an autoimmune response, and the white blood cells will generate an antibody against the spike protein without coronavirus actually being present.

This of course causes at least three major concerns. 1. While your white blood cells are still working on the antibody, your other cells are cranking out spike proteins that will be binding to any membrane they can find. I fear this will cause unwanted autoimmune effects, similar to how urushiol works. 2. Horizontal gene transfer with our bacterial microbiome, at which point fear is just useless because we've entered a nightmare senario. If this happens you could wind up with new disease. It could be benign. Or you could get super TB that manfactures spike proteins that bind to the membranes of your lungs, and has your white blood cells attack your own lung tissue. 3.

“What we have shown is that muscle cells take up this synthetic mRNA and will express almost any protein quickly. The technology will allow an intense, focused, one‐time application to drive a therapeutic effect that might have a long‐lasting effect by affecting, expanding and redirecting the fate of rare native tissue progenitors that are normally mobilized during injury and usually contribute to scar tissue.” [15] At Karolinska, the Chien lab documented the ability to generate large numbers of human Islet heart progenitor cells from human embryonic stem cells, which resulted in a partnership with Astrazeneca to move the project toward clinical application.[21][22]

In February 2019, AstraZeneca and the Chien lab reported the first in human study of an mRNA therapeutic, noting reversal of vascular dysfunction in diabetic patients by VEGF mRNA.[23]

Yet I’m the one who “doesn’t care” just because I question the validity of a vaccine (where you can’t hold the company distributing it liable and WE STILL don’t know the possible long term effects). I mean forgive me for not blindly following whatever the government says and what some celebrity tells me is right. If something goes wrong with my health, I’m the one who suffers...not them.

The first 2 months, March + April and maybe even May, I took the virus serious. But after seeing the protests/riots all summer. I basically was like “hold on...so that’s fine..but I can’t goto the gym?”. And say what you want but I saw A LOT of people there without mask.

I had to fly twice for job reasons...never got infected. Been going to the gym...never got infected. Before the gyms, I worked out at the park IN NYC and never wore a mask or gloves (neither did anyone else) and we’re fine. I’m just saying..if it was as contagious as people said, we’d be dead. It’s just using my brain is all (I’m not trying to come off as condescending or as a dick). Just saying..if it was as deadly as the media makes us believe, me and all those people and families at parks would’ve gotten it and been dead.

It's not an issue of bad coverage in specific areas, because the urban areas with higher amount of Black groups are better covered and have better accessibility for vaccinations than rural areas. 

So what is the explanation in my example low uptake in the black community? Given we cannot do the usual pointing at Tuskegee ?

  From what I understand this observation had been noted from quite a few independent countries also . I am not trying to be controversial or come across insensitive here I'm mixed race black myself; but i personally posit that there is a huge antivax problem in our community that stems beyond the reasonable concern from historical mistreatment. And I think non-black community are collectively walking on eggshells not to appear to use those words for obvious reasons.  But how do we fix it? 

you may be surprised at just how prevalent patently incorrect stories about the vaccine ""being designed to control black people"" ""being made by bill gates with chips inside "" etc etc are spread amongst facebook, whatsapp etc in black families.

This is not the case.  The 10% infection rate is over months, and presumably many incidences of exposure to the virus.  If you could break it down to individual events, the protection would look much closer to 99.5%.  
  
The other thing is that the distribution of ""true"" protection is not even distributed person to person.  There is some likelihood that a significant portion of that 10% failure population is concentrated around a small number of people for whom the vaccine didn't ""take"" properly for whatever reason - could be improper jabbing technique, or an underlying health condition suppressing the immune system, or even just binge drinking or drug interactions.  So for this small number of people, the effective protection is effectively zero, or close to it.  
  
So to vastly oversimplify the picture, if one out of ten vaccines are a dud, and the other 9 are 100% effective, that means that for the whole population, that vaccine is 90% effective - but that means the actual probability of individual protection is a conditional distribution with 100% protection ""given"" a good shot, and 0% protection ""given"" a dud.

There are a few nuances to this:

1) the rate of J&amp;J blood clots in young women seems to be much larger than the headline rate for all people.   It seems to primarily affect reproductive-age women, and most of the J&amp;J vaccines have not been administered to people in that specific demographic. So for young women, the risk is higher than this headline suggests. 

2) the blood clots caused by the vaccine are more dangerous than the ones caused by COVID. they are of a different type that is less treatable and more deadly. 

3) the proper comparison isn't to risks from COVID, but rather a comparison to other vaccines that don't cause this problem + the few weeks or months extra wait to get them.

[],,lifeinaglasshouse,,,,[],,,,text,t2_5fuud,False,False,[],"Not too long ago I made a super-rough estimate as to the number of Americans with immunity to COVID-19, by estimating that 1/3rd of the population had at least 1 dose, 1/3rd of the population had a prior infection, and that there was even crossover between these two groups. Below is my attempt at a  more accurate, though still rough, picture at where the US stands with regard to immunity:

1. There have been 560K deaths from COVID-19 in the US.

2. The most agreed upon IFR for COVID-19 is 0.6%.

3. This means that there have been 93.3 million cases of COVID-19 in the US (three times the number of reported cases).

4. Let's assume that 80% of these cases still carry sufficient immunity to ward off the virus. So 93.3M (.8) = 74.6M.

5. There are 328 million Americans. So 22.7% of Americans have sufficient immunity from infection.

6. According to the CDC, 36.1% of Americans have at least 1 shot of a COVID-19 vaccine.

7. Assuming a completely even distribution between these two groups (those with a prior infection and those who have been vaccinated), this means that the crossover between these groups is equal to (.361) (.226) = .082, or 8.2% of the population.

8. So this means that the number of people with a prior infection who have not been vaccinated is equal to 22.6% - 8.2% = 14.4% of the population.

9. So by adding the percent of the population who have been vaccinated (36.1%) to the percent of the population who have not been vaccinated, but have enough prior immunity to ward off an infection (14.4%), this gets you 50.5% of the population with immunity to COVID-19.

10. This is almost exactly in line with my super-rough estimate (55% of the population immune).

11. I've made some pretty big assumptions in this post, most notably that 80% of those infected are still sufficiently immune, and that the distribution between those immune from infection and those immune from vaccination is even. I've also assumed that anyone with an infection is immune, even when to the best of our knowledge, sufficient immunity to COVID-19 doesn't actually kick in until 2 weeks after your first dose of the vaccine. Because of this, it might be best to treat this estimate of where we will be 2 weeks from today, and not an accurate reflection of our levels of immunity today.

12. If I've made any mistakes in my math or in my assumptions, please let me know.

However now they can't break out of the pattern, even when evidence backs up the fact that vaccines are really effective at reducing both illness and, now with more data backing this up, transmission.

The problem, as I see it, is the educated classes of society have associated pessimism about the pandemic, vaccines,  etc.  as the only valid scientific viewpoint, when really based on evidence it is not really a valid outlook.  This really stems from the fact that education in true scientific analysis and thinking is so poor in this country.  It's not just anti-vaxers.  Even the otherwise educated classes of society who are ""taking COVID seriously"" and ""trusting the science"" have trouble really thinking and adjusting their opinions in a scientific manner as evidence builds and changes. 

Most people care more about being seen as a ""scientifically minded individual"" than actually doing the hard work of basing their opinions on data.

You're backing up a guy who very clearly doesn't want businesses to have the right to choose.  Maybe pick who you're supporting a little better?

&gt;Your argument that vaccinated people can die from covid is completely unfounded.

You linked a CDC study on anaphylaxis from the COVID shot.  What exactly do you think that study is proving?  Because it isn't looking at the likelihood of death from COVID after getting the vaccine.  You use the term ""right now"" like this is some updated tracking thing.  It's not.  It followed the first 1.8M people who received the vaccine for 2 weeks.  [Yes, fully vaccinated people die from COVID](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/ORDHS/bulletins/2cbf6cf)

&gt;Logically? Sticking chemicals into your arm to fight a natural virus that can cause mild or asymptomatic symptoms isn't logic. (I can picture many of you being triggered by this statement but you know it's true.

5700 people between the age of 30 and 39 died from COVID-19.  2000 people between 18 and 29.  Yes, it is logical to inject chemicals into your arm in order to avoid even that small chance of death.  Never mind, all the other benefits.

And like I said to the other guy, you're really hanging your hat on this being some totalitarian regime level thing as being the difference between an EUA and full approval?  We get full approval and it's cool?  But under an EUA, that's somehow N4zi Germany shit?  Really?  Not being a little melodramatic?

&gt;In a [systematic review](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/223/4/550/6009483?login=true) of published studies on transmission of the novel coronavirus and other respiratory viruses, Razani and colleagues found that less than 10 percent of cases described were spread outdoors. But they also found frustratingly few papers that detailed the settings or clearly compared indoor and outdoor situations.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Our takeaway from this is that it’s not impossible to get an infection outdoors, even though from what is published, clearly the proportion of when that happens is much lower,” Razani said. She added: “If you are going to a beach — which is a beautiful thing — you should avoid times when it’s crowded, and have your mask, and have a Plan B.”

&amp;#x200B;

Less than 10 percent of cases being from outdoors transmission is still a lot of cases.

Where did you get this from? There are other vaccines available in the UK, and based on the results of a recent risk assessment, people in the UK under 30 will be offered a different vaccine where one is available. If no other vaccine is available, it's still recommended that people get the AZ vaccine regardless of age.

The risk assessment showed that due to current Covid rates being so low, [the risk of harm from the vaccine is greater than the risk of Covid for young people](https://wintoncentre.maths.cam.ac.uk/media/images/AZ_harms-benefits_low_exposure_8-4-21.width-800.png). If rates increase, [the risk of Covid would outweigh the risk of vaccination](https://wintoncentre.maths.cam.ac.uk/media/images/AZ_harms-benefits_medium_exposure_8-4-21.width-800.png) and the decision by the government to restrict the AZ vaccine for under-30s would be reviewed.

Many vulnerable groups have been vaccinated, and we have relatively few - about 12 - new inpatients in the intensive care unit each week.
By dropping the use of AstraZeneca, the vaccination of the 65- to 69-year-olds will be postponed by two weeks, says the director.
- In the two weeks we delay the vaccination rollout for them, we may be able to prevent one case of admissions to the intensive care unit, Søren Brostrøm estimates.
Conversely, we can expect five people to get severe blood clots if we use the 200,000 AstraZeneca doses that the Statens Serum Institut currently has on hold.
- There we assess that it can not be answered - that it can not be justified to continue using AstraZeneca, he says.""

No the 80% is a reduction in probability compared to not being vaccinated. 

So if 100 people were not vaccinated and 25 become infected. Under the same behavior and exposure only 5 /100 of them would have been infected. 

&gt;If I'm right here (and please educate me if I'm wrong), what factors decide whether or not a vaccine will work on one individual and not the other? And the 80 people on whom the vaccine did its intended job, will they be saved even after repeated exposure to the disease?


There are two extremes here. The vaccine works 100% of the time in 80% of people and 0% of the time in the remaining 20% or the vaccines only works 80% of the time in 100% of people.

Reality is probably somewhere in between. That is to say no matter who you are there is still a slim chance of being vaccinated.

The CDC has already researched this.

""From January 26, 2020, through October 3, 2020, an estimated 299,028 more persons than expected have died in the United States. Excess deaths reached their highest points to date during the weeks ending April 11 (40.4% excess) and August 8, 2020 (23.5% excess) (Figure 1). **Two thirds of excess deaths during the analysis period (66.2%; 198,081) were attributed to COVID-19 and the remaining third to other causes** (Figure 1).

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778234

Causes of deaths that increased: 

**Heart disease: +31,000**

https://www.heart.org/en/news/2020/12/16/covid-19-is-the-big-story-in-mortality-statistics-but-not-the-only-one

""Either it's causing problems with the treatment of other conditions because hospitals are overwhelmed, **or people are staying home and aren't coming in when they have heart attacks and strokes and other emergencies**,"" said Elkind, who also is president of the American Heart Association.

https://khn.org/news/eerie-emptiness-of-er-worries-doctors-as-heart-attack-and-stroke-patients-delay-care/

**Unintentional injury: +19,000**

These are drug overdoses or misclassified suicides.  Definitely not Covid.

**Stroke: +9,000**

See above

**Alzheimer's: +12,000**

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/21/alzheimers-patients-dying-during-covid-19-pandemic/4218661001/

""Perhaps the biggest factor in the increase of deaths of dementia patients is the protocols to keep the coronavirus from spreading and the changes in routine – including a lack of visitors and the isolation. 

Dementia patients do best when they have a set routine and social interaction.""

**Diabetes: +14,000**

This is the only one where it's possible the majority are misattributed to Covid, although this could be a similar situation to heart disease and stroke where people aren't getting the treatment they need due to fear.

It's silly to assume that completely shutting down and altering life for over a year while the media constantly crams fear down everyone's throats would not have negative deadly consequences.  Just because there are excess deaths does not mean they are misattributed to Covid, *especially* since hospitals are financially incentivized to mark something as a Covid.

Note: The following is very simplified and I will avoid scientific jargon.

Vaccines simply inform your immune system of a potential threat ahead of the actual threat so that it can prepare for it. Its much like training at the gym before a weight lifting competition. The vaccine trains your immune system to literally recognize C19 before ever being exposed to it in the real world.

Which means, If you were to be exposed to C19, odds are your immune system is going to see it within hours of exposure depending on the quantity of the virus you were exposed to. It will then go to work very quickly to irradicate it from your system. The thing to note here is your immune system is doing the work - not the vaccine. The vaccine is most likely out of your system by this point.

If exposed to C19 you ""could"" be a danger to others especially if you still develop any symptoms. Your just way more prepared to get over it faster and in some cases not even show symptoms at all.

In reality, most people do recover and don't have significant 'long COVID' effects.  I've not heard of it increasing the risk of stroke, once the main disease passes. Do you have any data on that?  If there are 'long' effects they are more similar to ME/CFS, which is possibly post-viral as well.

Notes:

* Data from [CDC vaccination demographic trends page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends) and exact totals for every age group can be downloaded as a CSV.  The site provides a graph of this data over time.  While the graph title says it is by ""Date Administered"", the data more closely represents doses by ""Date Reported"".
* Deltas are based on changes in the actual number of people from CDC source data and may not match differences in rounded percentages.
* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC source due to lack of age-related vaccination data, so data may not match national totals.
* Currently, no vaccines are approved for use in ages 0-15. The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group. The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates for the US that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, and assumes that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17.
* 16+ and 0+ age groups include doses administered to those of unknown ages.

Notes:

* Data from [CDC vaccination demographic trends page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends) and exact totals for every age group can be downloaded as a CSV.  The site provides a graph of this data over time.  While the graph title says it is by ""Date Administered"", the data more closely represents doses by ""Date Reported"".
* Deltas are based on changes in the actual number of people from CDC source data and may not match differences in rounded percentages.
* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC source due to lack of age-related vaccination data, so data may not match national totals.
* Currently, no vaccines are approved for use in ages 0-15. The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group. The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates for the US that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, and assumes that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17.
* 16+ and 0+ age groups include doses administered to those of unknown ages. This is usually less than 0.02% of the total doses administered.",,,1618428310,{},guit5ym,False,t3_mql75w,False,True,t1_guin9vp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mql75w/daily_discussion_thread_april_14_2021/guit5ym/,1618434839,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

This pandemic will be studied for years to come.  Books will be written about it.  Future policy makers, scientists, etc. will be studying this at school.

The argument that the positive effects of vaccinating with AZ outweighs the risk of some people dying is being upvoted and parroted throughout the thread.

Uk just counts it as a covid death if someone who dies had a positive covid test in the past 28 days. It doesn't matter how they die or if it was respiratory related or blood clots or any of that.

The only way to get actually accurate figures is to compare 2020 deaths with 2019 deaths.

Not laughing, just horrified at what you’ve become. 

&gt;and now we’re on top of our game a year later

That’s why Michigan is locking down again, right? You’ve JUST brought your per capita numbers in line with ours this month and we don’t have nearly the number of people vaccinated as you do...because, ya know, export restrictions. 

&gt; and people all of sudden are acting like it’s the US’s duty to help everyone out.

Help? We made those contracts with private companies—not your government—and paid for them with our money, not your tax dollars, and you’re acting like we’re asking you for an aid package from the US taxpayers. GTFO, this isn’t some 80s action flick where the world is waiting on the US to come up with some cunning plan to save our asses. 

Step back from the situation and internalize the fact that after a year of fucking around and flouting the rules, with the numbers to show for it, you’re the ones who are actively withholding the medicine that we already bought.  

&gt;Fuck outta here lol. You can’t cherry pick when you like the US or not. You either do or don’t.

Wtf? Easy there, Bush. After this past year, don’t be surprised at some of the trends you see with respect to your standing continue to nosedive. 

&gt;The US is already sending an insane amount of leftover supplies to our neighbors.

And restricting an even higher amount.

&gt;Hopefully after this, Canada will smarten up and decide to build vaccine plants in house to avoid a mess like this in the future.

currently in my country they are pressuring older people to take the vaccine despite of the EMA saying there is a risk which is neither age nor sex specific with the argument that they will die of covid otherwise.

it comes after younger people who got offeredAZ earlier didn’t accept it because they have no high risk of dying from covid.

what I fear, they will only offer AZ to older people and if they don’t want it, they say they are vaccine deniers and move on to younger folks without having vaccinated the older people who are anxious about AZ. at some point soon there will be unvaccinated people but nobody over 60 anymore who wants the vaccine and the stockpile will get bigger again. then they will surely lift the rules.

from an ethical stand point I think giving it to 60+ only is highly problematic and many people over 60 feel like the government wants to clean their image of failing to get us vaccines by forcing older people to take a risky vaccine which probably wouldn’t be used at all if we had a choice. Countries who have a choice like the US and Switzerland have already excluded AZ from their vaccine program.  /:",,,1618421126,{},guicudv,False,t3_mqnod6,False,False,t1_guhiazv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mqnod6/astrazeneca_vaccine_permanently_stopped_in/guicudv/,1618425466,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

When we only had 5 or 6 new infections (not cases) per day in the US, there was a much lower risk of any one person spreading this disease than there currently exists for a vaccinated person to spread it.

I know that sounds surprising, but it's true.  And this isn't me relying on the whole ""We don't know if it slows/stops spread.""  This is just realizing that if it isn't 100.0% at stopping symptomatic COVID, it's not going to be 100.0% at stopping spread either.

My point is, you would have put masks on people when the benefit was lower than the benefit you're calling insignificantly small.

The problem is those consequences can extend to those who did everything right.

More cynically, giving vaccine skeptics hope that they can just wait until restrictions are lifted may discourage some from getting vaccinated.

Absolutely. A very slightly flawed vaccine is enormously better than no vaccine.

Both France, Italy and others are vaccinating with AZ as there are still large numbers of people over 55(?) and 60 to vaccinate. Denmark and Norway, who are refusing AZ altogether, have lower death rates than the UK which is why they can consider such a step. 

In Italy, specifically, 95% of all deaths have been people over 60 so the deaths will be behind us when the question comes up of what to do with any remaining AZ.

Regarding the question where exactly the spike protein is expressed:
That depends mainly on the mRNA sequence. A so called ""signal peptide"" at the start of the protein coding sequence acts like an address for where to put that newly synthesized protein. 

Then, a second determinant is whether the protein contains a ""membrane anchor"", which is a region of hydrophobic/lipophilic amino acids, that want to be in a lipid membrane, not free floating in water. 

BioNTech/Pfizer have released their mRNA sequence, and it has been nicely analysed here: https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/

To 1) they use the same signal peptide as is in the virus, so the initial expression of the protein should be in the same localisation as is in the real infection. That is, in the endoplasmic reticulum, and it can then be found in the secretory pathway all the way to the cell surface (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15831954/).

To 2) the spike protein naturally contains a membrane anchor (""transmembrane domain"") at the C-terminus (the ""last"" part). This means the protein will be anchored in a lipid membrane (e.g. The lipid membrane of the ER, which is then the one that ends up being the viral membrane). (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466921/)

Thus, if antibodies against spike are already there, they can bind to this protein and mark these cells for destruction (""opsonization""). However, the primary mechanism on how this induces immunity goes a step further:

Cells have continuous turnover of proteins, through degradation pathways that include proteinases (proteins that cut other proteins). These can produce smaller fragments (""peptides"") that the cell then presents to professional immune cells on its surface (via MHC1), kind of like a checksum/overview on which proteins have recently been in the cell. 

The peptides in MHC1 are detected by T cells and if found on a normal cell may lead to the T cell killing the infected cell. 

Optimally for a vaccine you wouldn't express the protein in any random cell, but in ""professional antigen presenting cells"", e.g. dendritic cells (DCs). Their job is essentially to closely interact with B and T cells, showing them all the proteins they're making (MHC1) and that they have picked up from outside or their surface (MHC2). Former will prime T cells, the latter B cells. 

And indeed, the mRNA vaccines are targeting DCs for the expression of spike:

Your FAQ says rightly that:

&gt;To that end, if this vaccine causes a widespread problem in the future  (which, again, is very unlikely), it would be reasonable to suspect this  hypothetical adverse event would occur from natural infection as well.

But what about broken RNA and DNA coming from the process of production? (I did read somewhere that Biontech vaccines were 70-75% pure, not 100 or 99.x%). I assume that small bits or RNA should be destroyed by the body, what about some DNA from the production process that could have made it through?

Okay, so we're in full agreement that the vaccine being this massively deployed is because of Pfizer. What are you even trying to argue? Whatever company Pfizer would have chosen to partner with would be the vaccine that is the most used in the US. Pfizer obviously tried to pick one of the best companies that was available in BioNTech, but their choice didn't change how they tested or mass produced the vaccine. 


BioNTech's production will be impressive in the future but it will be completely irrelevant to the US, which is who we are currently discussing. Andres57 implied that German funding is the reason Americans are getting vaccinated, but this couldn't be further from the truth.

In addition, the very mRNA technology used was developed and funded by the US.

[],,t_hab,,,,[],,,,text,t2_6g8dx,False,False,[],"Where am I getting that broad ballpark range that I never claimed was a fact (read the word ""likely"")? It's a mix of sources and commonly accepted estimation techniques. You can get to the same or similar range in many ways. This is how I did it:

Approximately 6.8 million Americans have been vaccinated with J&amp;J. I'm excluding all other countries because the data surrounding the 6 cases are all from the USA. 

Roughly half of the recipients can be assumed to be women. That means that approximately 3.4 have been given to women of all ages. It's likely [higher than this](https://khn.org/news/article/gender-vaccine-gap-more-women-than-men-vaccinated-against-covid/) because women tend to live longer and older people are vaccinated first, but since we are interested in ""young"" women we don't have to adjust our estimate for this fact. Over the age groups we care about men and women are almost exactly 50% of the population. The vaccine gap may continue at younger ages but I don't feel comfortable assuming that. If you assume that it does, adjust my estimate up by roughly 20%.

Next, we define ""young women"" which, in this case, seems to be pre-menopausal women. We only have 6 data points so I'm projecting the range to be 16 (minimum age to be vaccinated) to 50 (close to the average age for menopause). If you adjust that range then you will adjust my estimate. 

In many states, women in that age group have been opened up for vaccinations and many women qualified immediately either by having pre-conditions, working in health care, or working in education. But we don't need to guess their ages. [We can use real data](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/) The lower three buckets in this website cover the ages 18 to 49. That's close enough to my age range that I made no adjustment. If you used 45 as the top of your age range then you have to adjust down slightly. This gives us approximately 20.8M fully vaccinated young people out of 68.2M fully vaccinated people overall, or **30.5% of fully vaccinated people being in this range.** (Since J&amp;J is a one shot vaccination we have to ignore the partially vaccinated people or we mix in data from Pfizer and Moderna). 

We now take the approximately 3.4M doses applied to women and multiply it by the 30.5% and we find an estimate of **1 million young women being vaccinated**. 

If you want to be more conservative, however, you can use 44 or 45 as your top range. It's also worth being conservative. The real number may be well above 1M but it is certainly above 500k. This overly cautious approach is what led me to say 500k to 1M, but it would probably be more accurate to give a range of 800k to 1.2M.",,,1618410693,{},guhowt0,False,t3_mq7xwa,False,True,t1_guga4g6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mq7xwa/blood_clots_more_likely_from_covid_than_jj_shot/guhowt0/,1618411603,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

[],,T-Tyrant,,,,[],,,,text,t2_1edrm7rh,False,False,[],"My last impassioned response was removed for being uncivil. Which, fair, I felt very strongly about what I was saying. Let me try again more calmly.

I think the asker's phrasing only comes across as fear-mongering to someone who is on the defensive. I get it, there are a lot of anti-vaxxers who speak in bad faith. However, I don't think this post can be read as being in bad faith until the poster makes a pattern of rejecting pro-vaccine replies or stirring up arguments about vaccine data. Which hasn't happened. The poster began this particular post with ""Yay!"" which reads to me as someone who is showing their positive feelings toward the vaccine news before moving on to their simple question.

I don't believe it's fair to expect everyone to hedge their vaccine-related questions with ""I'm not an anti-vaxxer BUT"" to have their questions respected. And I don't think it's fair or wise to shame people for expressing their concerns. ""Fear-mongering""? What if the asker *is* afraid? People should be allowed to search for answers and explanations to their points of concern. In this situation, another two vaccines *have* been found to cause blood clots. Someone who doesn't know the difference between how those vaccines work versus mRNA vaccines has reason to wonder how we can be sure that the same won't happen with Moderna or Pfizer. 

Heck, if nobody asked if Johnson and Johnson's or AstraZeneca's vaccines were the cause of the blood clots, we wouldn't have that answer either.

Good, true science should be able to face questions. And people who are looking for answers, whether it be due to fear or not, should have their questions respected. If I was shamed for asking questions, and told I was part of the problem for asking questions, whether it be about a religion, or a political leader, or a drug I was getting injected into my arm, I'd probably be an anti-vaxxer myself.",,,1618429787,{},guiwkf8,False,t3_mqaxv0,False,True,t1_guhpyn4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mqaxv0/moderna_says_new_data_shows_its_covid_vaccine_is/guiwkf8/,1618436774,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],
