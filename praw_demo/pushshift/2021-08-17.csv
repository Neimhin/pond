By mid-April, 86 percent of those vaccinated with AstraZeneca were under 60 years old.  
According to the Vaccination Ordinance, however, younger people were only vaccinated if they fell into a prioritization group for health or professional reasons - for example because they work in the health care system or childcare: occupations with a high proportion of women.

There's been a fair number of press releases, and not always with preprints. In general industry did a decent job publishing and academia and small clinics, not so much. 

And yeah, something with at least a methods section is always nice.

Science is always repeatable,
With steps clear and completable,
The rest is a trick,
That might look real slick,
But smells like something excretable. 

For far too many treatments (e.g., doxycycline) there were a handful of trials that didn't seem to share anything. Not even a press release. 

Which is troubling as doxycycline seems to have been both ineffective and to have put patients at risk of a serious adverse event, esophageal ulcers. 

I mean it's not as bad as oleander, but that's on the short list of stuff that can kill a goat. 

We could certainly use some affordable and effective treatments for COVID-19 that could be used in places still struggling to get enough vaccines. 

But somethings as simple as picking 28 days as a standard mortality endpoint and agreeing that death is the biggest number on the scale, not the smallest, would go a long way to making everything comparable.

It is open to 40 year olds tomorrow, 30 year olds in a week and all ages 16 plus from 1 September.  

We bought our vaccines late because we waited to see which vaccine was best, then went with a single vaccine strategy, all Pfizer. As a result we were the back of the line for shipments and most of our vaccines only began to arrive at the end of July.  We should be finished vaccinating by November or December.  

For ICU beds we have 4.6 per 100,000, which is very low compared to the US and Germany, though not massively lower than a number of EU countries.  

The economy has been booming in NZ, growing faster than the US, UK or EU. Our unemployment is lower (4%), wage growth is higher than in a decade and a house price explosion has created a lot of wealth.  

In terms of working remotely, no we haven't done that outside of a few short lockdowns.  For the vast majority of the last 18 months things have been totally normal here.  We don't wear masks (aside from on public transport), don't have social distancing or capacity limits.

It's way for the government to be money grubbing. It's a way to deter people from buying as much weed by using finance as a soft gate.

Sure, it's smaller, but they bothered to post their results.

Peer review is a completely separate process that always takes time. 

Posting results is fast. There is some data review, but it's done by paid professionals and not volunteer ones.  So, posting can be a much faster turnaround.

But far too many sponsors are just doing press releases and publications without bothering to post their results on the clinical trials databases first.

And I know posting sounds time consuming, it's not. You just have to send an email. Like the one that got the trial listed. Only with the results filled in this time.  

It hasn't made it out into press yet, but I proposed sponsors being debarred from future funding as the punishment for presenting results without posting them.

When I compared the proportion of people I know in India that had suffered a bereavement and the proportion of people in the UK who had suffered a bereavement there seemed to be way more in India but yet the official deaths per capita figures were not even comparable. The UK's was way higher.

[],,Partha4us,,,[],,,,text,t2_4dv3w4se,False,False,,"Hundreds of thousands of people in the Netherlands whose immune systems do not work properly do not benefit, or benefit only slightly, from vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2. Part of this large group does not produce antibodies and immune cells. The rest produce too little of them. Other vaccinations cause similar problems in these patients.

In some patients the vaccinations work better than expected. This applies, for example, to dialysis patients and to patients with certain congenital disorders of the immune system. They produce about as many antibodies as healthy people.

People who do not respond well to the vaccines are patients who take immunosuppressive drugs, transplant patients, (blood) cancer patients and people with congenital disorders of the immune system. People with HIV and people with Down syndrome are also at risk.

Immune-suppressing drugs are taken, for example, by patients with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. The extent to which the effect of vaccinations is diminished by the immunosuppressive drugs depends on the dosage, on any use of combinations of drugs and on the severity of the condition. In total, 820,000 Dutch people took an immune check in 2020, according to the Foundation for Pharmaceutical Statistics. In the first six months of 2021, 520,000 people did so.
Since the beginning of this year, eight studies have been running in the Netherlands on different subgroups of patients who suffer from impaired immunity. ZonMw, the main financier of medical-scientific research, has allocated 15.5 million for the studies.

In a webinar organized by ZonMw today, the first results of four studies were announced. These have not yet been published or peer reviewed.

Collaboration

The studies are being conducted in close collaboration between the Dutch UMCs. RIVM and ZonMw have ensured that the studies use a standardized method to measure the immune response of the participants, so that the results are mutually comparable.

Severe kidney disease patients have a three to five times higher risk of dying from covid-19 than average. The study on vaccination of kidney patients yielded relatively favorable outcomes for patients with renal failure and dialysis patients. Over 80 percent of those patients produced sufficient antibodies after complete vaccination.

Of those who have undergone kidney transplantation, two-thirds did not respond or responded inadequately to vaccination. They do not build up protection, or not enough.

Survivors

In patients who have undergone lung transplantation, the picture is more complicated. If those contract covid-19, their transplanted lungs are affected.

Patients who have undergone lung transplantation and have survived covid-19 build up a good defence against the virus after vaccination. One vaccine is then sufficient as a booster for the natural defenses. Patients on the waiting list for a lung transplant also benefit from vaccination.

The situation is very different for transplanted patients who have not yet received covid-19. Of the more than 100 patients who took part in the study, only 13 percent produced sufficient antibodies.

Blood cancer

Every year there are about ten thousand diagnoses with a form of blood cancer or lymphoma in the Netherlands. All those patients have various disorders of the immune system. For the study, 850 patients were selected with 17 different forms of blood or lymph node cancer and all at risk of severe course of covid-19.

In all patients, the functioning of the immune system is disturbed. This may be because they are undergoing chemotherapy, immunotherapy or cell therapy or because their tumor is paralyzing the immune system. There are also patients who are receiving immunosuppressive drugs or whose immune system is recovering after a stem cell transplant.

According to guidelines, patients in this group should not receive vaccination during treatment for their hematological condition. During the study, the patients did get vaccinated. Some of them reacted better than expected and produced sufficient antibodies, while others did not.

Variation

A similar difference in reactions to vaccination occurs in patients with congenital disorders of the immune system. While some do not produce antibodies at all, others do and to a sufficient degree.

The patients with the most severe forms of immunodeficiency - the lack of certain substances crucial to the immune system - did not benefit from vaccination.

A third or possibly even a fourth shot could improve protection for some of the people with immune problems. Further research is being done into this. For another group of patients, even third or even fourth shots will not elicit protection, the researchers expect.

The 345k number of deaths are deaths that a medical examiner/doctor had made a call that Covid19 is the underlying cause in a chain of events that led to the immediate cause of death. An obese person who is not in the best of health, but who were not likely to die in the next few years, catches Covid19 which led to pneumonia and ARDS and dies would have Covid19 as the underlying cause. The obesity could be listed as conditions contributing to death. 

You can also look at the number of 'excess deaths' in 2020 to quantify the impact covid19 on deaths. CDC found that an estimated 545k to 660k more persons died in the US from all causes between 1/26/20 to 2/27/21 than expected of a typical year.

Many of these countries used vaccines like Sinovax and Sinopharm, neither of which have a great track record.

\&gt;The effects of the P681R mutation in the context of B.1.617.2 were understood in late April 2021, and the situation in India had fully unfolded to biblical disaster proportions already by May 1st 2021.

May was right around the time cases started declining in the US and Delta had not begun to spread here yet. This is about when the CDC changed their mask guidance as well. Our goal was supposed to be reaching herd immunity, which supposedly could be reached at 70% and where were we in May? Less than 50% but the case decline made it appear that the amount was enough to deal with the regular strains, which seemed to be the case at the time. So, obviously, the best time for vaccinated people to remove their masks was when the nation wasn't highly vaccinated! /s

The problem really isn't less outright lying and more obfuscation of information. The CDC has still never come outright and said, ""We need vaccination rates to be at 85%-90% nationwide in order to move pass this"" or set any real vaccination goals for that matter. Did they know Delta could possibly settle here?

In Canada we value social healthcare. No matter who you are, what you've done, you deserve the basic right of healthcare. Its a slippery slope we start ourselves down being judge and jury of who does and doesn't deserve healthcare based on their lifestyle and/or pre-existing conditions.

On the other hand COVID isn't like other diseases or conditions. Most other conditions only affect the individual, the ramifications of poor personal health don't usually extend beyond the user and don't typically overburden the system. I feel no issue with helping individuals in their time of need under these circumstances, regardless of what led them to that end. But COVID is a different beast, the consequences of their selfishness spill over to others whether its directly giving them COVID or delaying other's access to healthcare as a consequence of an overburdened system. My sympathies for this crowd are practically non-existent at this point in time. I don't blame others for suggesting that we do be judge and jury and reconsider what we owe these people for breaking their end of our social contract.

Operational beds are defined in Project IMPACT as ‚Äúthe total number of licensed ICU beds in your unit for which you maintain nursing staff and which are considered operational.‚Äù

This is what a lot of people, including reporters, gloss over. It‚Äôs expensive for a hospital to staff a bed with nobody in it, but to be included as an available bed you must have that. So, hospitals will shut down areas of their hospital when they have lower occupancy purposely so they can reduce staffing requirements and save money. Nothing wrong with it but it‚Äôs why you see a lot of hospitals hitting 80% occupancy regularly. It‚Äôs by their own design. Now, this is fine when you‚Äôre comparing normal situations, but when you‚Äôre comparing to a time when hospitals are dealing in surge capacity where they stretch the limits of their resources, throw beds in tents, hire traveling nurses, send elective surgery patients home, etc, etc. well then this sort of % capacity is very different and shouldn‚Äôt be compared to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù times.",,,,1629257026,{},h9dby53,False,t3_p6c2li,False,False,t1_h9co8xe,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p6c2li/five_states_have_intensive_care_units_over_90/h9dby53/,1629333744.0,29,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

I did an at home Covid test yesterday, and it was negative. But his cough grew progressively worse. So he went to urgent care today because he could not be fit in to be seen with his pediatrician because there were no openings. I had him tested today officially for Covid in the urgent care clinic  . 

Even though he did not officially have a result yet, I reached out to his what would have been his  ‚Äúfirst ever teacher‚Äù yesterday via text that he has been sick and I felt it better to not risk it‚Ä¶.this all before the doctor visit today and official testing today. 

And it literally was SO hard because the struggle of having to let go of what was to be this amazing beautiful milestone of a week for my son, I had to let go of my own selfish desires , and put the teacher first, and other kids‚Ä¶.as hard as that was‚Ä¶ and I did cry a lot of tears of mourning that at Target today (while masked) buying cold humidifiers and other items to help him breathe more comfortably‚Ä¶ I know not going and attending was and is the right thing. And he won‚Äôt be attending school this week. (And maybe not at all this semester at the look of things)‚Ä¶.

Now, I‚Äôm waiting for his Covid results.

Cold coffee, cold pizza, barely a lunch break. The level of illness for these patients, we‚Äôre seeing them far sicker for far longer. They‚Äôre requiring more resources.*

*Medical centers around the country, from North Carolina to Texas to Nevada, are reporting full ICUs as severe illness from the pandemic ramps up again, this time in unvaccinated populations.*

*Seattle hospitals are so full it‚Äôs preventing Alaska hospitals in Southeast from transferring patients there, providers here say. The national COVID-19 surge makes it harder to get traveling, fill-in nurses to Alaska.*

*The ICU crunch comes with another new challenge here:* ***few restrictions in place at the municipal or state level to try to stall the spread of the virus****.*

*Last year, state and municipal officials enacted strict COVID-19 mandates such as travel restrictions and, in Anchorage, a mask mandate and capacity restrictions, to safeguard the state‚Äôs fragile hospital capacity.*

***Now Gov. Mike Dunleavy and Anchorage Mayor Dave Bronson say the decision to wear masks, much less get vaccinated, is up to individual Alaskans. (ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)***

*Hospital officials say they don‚Äôt see a quick end to capacity problems without a change in behavior like broad vaccination or masking.""*

What a depressing read. Poor medical staff are being left high and dry by unvaccinated citizens and their enabling lawmakers with no end in sight.

&gt;Nationwide reports from nursing homes show about 4,900 new resident cases over the four weeks that ended Aug. 1, up from 1,570 in the prior four weeks, federal data show. Staff cases have also more than tripled to 8,300 in the same period, the data show.

&gt;In Florida, the most recent week‚Äôs resident and staff cases‚Äî568 and 727, respectively‚Äîare at the highest levels since January, federal data show. Deaths remain more muted but also appear to be on the rise, with 78 among Florida nursing-home residents in the last two weeks, eclipsing the total from the prior 14 weeks.

&gt;Deaths at long-term-care facilities in Florida have dropped sharply since vaccinations became available in December and the state has coordinated with facilities to provide shots for residents and staff, said a spokeswoman for Florida‚Äôs Agency for Health Care Administration.

NZ's economy has been in vastly better shape than the US or the UK over the past year, it bounced back just fine after the original lockdown period when this all first started. We have very low unemployment, wages are rising, interest rates are low, the private and national debt is a fraction of comparable countries, the only major day to day economic issues are NZ systemic ones (like the supermarket monopolies and distorted housing market) which would exist with or without Covid. A lot of businesses took a temporary hit, but then made a massive profit later as everything bounced back and all the pent up demand surged up again (which made them look bad when it came to examining who got subsidies on the basis of making a loss, so there are plenty of recorded examples in the media).

Also, we have proper wage subsidies, so while people may lose out on some money, they don't have to choose between starving and breaking lockdown. Ordering people to stay home without supporting them to do so *would* be crazy.

All the data shows at this point that lives v.s. the economy is a ridiculous false equivalence.

Posted on August 17, 2021
The UMCG is conducting research into the effect of COVID-19 vaccines in kidney patients, lung transplant patients and patients with cancer. On Tuesday, August 17, the first two studies presented their results. Vaccinations do not work sufficiently in several patient groups.
 
Family in lockdown

During an information session for interested media, a kidney transplant patient explained the impact of corona on her life. She received a kidney transplant in 2007 and takes medication to ensure that her immune system does not reject the new kidney. For patients like her, the corona virus is especially dangerous: she can become seriously ill from the virus and the risk of death for her is considerably greater than for others.

She and her family have been in lockdown since the beginning of the pandemic. For example, her son is not going to school. Although she says she is used to it, it is clear that the situation is taking its toll on her and her family. And there are many like this patient: an estimated 500,000 people in the Netherlands with weakened immune systems are at extra risk during the pandemic and are therefore severely restricted in what they can and cannot do.

Importance of an effective vaccine

A vaccine that works well and is safe is especially important for these vulnerable people. However, the currently available vaccines have mainly been studied in relatively healthy adults. Specific risk groups are not included in these studies, or only to a very limited extent. As a result, there is insufficient knowledge about the immune response of the vaccine in patients who are known to have a less well-functioning immune system, as a result of a congenital disorder, from medication after a transplant or from chemotherapy or immunotherapy for cancer.

From ZonMw, eight studies have been started into the effect of COVID-19 vaccines in vulnerable groups. Three of these are coordinated in the UMCG. These are studies into the effect of COVID-19 vaccines in kidney patients, lung transplant patients and patients with cancer. The first two presented their first results on Tuesday, August 17.

Effectiveness in lung transplant patients

Corona vaccines are safe for lung transplant patients, but in a good proportion of patients who have undergone lung transplantation, the corona vaccination is not or hardly effective, because virtually no antibodies are produced. This is evident from the initial results of the study led by lung transplant specialist Erik Verschuuren and virologist Coretta van Leer of the UMCG.

Many of these patients still fear infection with the coronavirus on a daily basis, and many of them live in constant quarantine. They may benefit from a third or even fourth shot, but until then they are mostly dependent on vaccination coverage in their immediate environment and in society.

Patients who have had lung transplants are given medications to keep their bodies from rejecting the new lungs. These drugs suppress the immune system, but this also makes these patients more susceptible to viral infections, such as the coronavirus. The coronavirus is even more dangerous for them because the virus infects the transplanted organ, the lungs. In addition, an infection lasts longer because the immune response is suppressed.

A corona infection is a lot more dangerous for lung transplant patients than for healthy people. They have a greater chance of ending up in the ICU and of dying from corona.

Effect of the vaccine on kidney patients

In the Netherlands there are about 12,000 kidney transplant patients who use immunosuppressive drugs, about 60,000 patients with kidney failure and 6,000 dialysis patients. A research group led by internist-nephrologist Jan-Stephan Sanders of the UMCG is investigating the immune system response to a COVID-19 vaccination in these three patient groups.

The good news: the first results show that vaccination with a corona vaccine is safe for all kidney patients. Also good news: the first results show that the immune response in patients with kidney failure and dialysis patients is good: after two vaccinations they have produced sufficient antibodies. Whether this remains so needs further investigation. However, this does not apply to kidney transplant patients: 43% of this group have no antibodies.

Amount of antibodies

The researchers also looked at the amount of antibodies that people produce and to what extent they can inhibit the virus. Here too, kidney transplant patients do not score well: in 67% no or insufficient antibodies are produced. These are usually patients who have recently received a transplant, patients with lower kidney function, patients taking multiple immunosuppressive drugs, and patients taking immunosuppressive drugs containing the substance MMF.

Booster

A solution for these patients could be a booster: one or more extra vaccinations that would enable them to produce sufficient antibodies. The researchers are going to investigate effective applications of this. Perhaps it will help - if it is safe - to (temporarily) stop taking certain immunosuppressive drugs and then to vaccinate.

More information

More information about the study into the effects of the corona vaccine in people with cancer, the third study the UMCG is leading, will follow shortly. On the ZonMw website you can find all the information about the eight studies. You can also read their news item about the knowledge session here.

Lack of freedom underexposed

Because all the studies are structured in the same way, the researchers and ZonMw hope to eventually be able to draw comparisons between the various patient groups. What applies to all of them in any case is that they stand to benefit most from a high vaccination rate among people in their immediate vicinity and in society as a whole. Lung transplant specialist Erik Verschuuren: ""Ultimately there will remain a large group of patients that we won't be able to protect against corona. In the discussion about the freedom that everyone in the Netherlands has to decide whether or not to be vaccinated, this remains underexposed. These patients are often desperate, and the freedom they are giving up is permanent.

""Unfortunately, many have declined to take the vaccine, and some end up severely ill or dead. I cannot and will not force anyone to take the vaccine, but I also cannot continue to watch my patients suffer and die from an eminently preventable disease.""

Valentine reportedly added that patients who wish to continue seeing him may submit proof of vaccination, and the office ""will happily transfer"" documentation of patients choosing to seek the care of a different physician.¬†
Alabama reported 2,466 new cases and one death in the past day, according to the¬†Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. Nearly 36 percent of the state's population are fully vaccinated with more than 3.8 million doses administered.¬†

Alabama Gov.¬†Kay Ivey (R) announced Friday¬†a ""narrowly focused state of emergency"" to strategically cut ""red tape wherever we can to allow our doctors, nurses and hospital staff to treat patients that come through their doors.""
""Alabama remains open for business,""¬†Ivey said in a statement. ""Alabamians do not need government telling us what to do or how to do it. Unlike last year when we were hoping for a miracle, our greatest weapon against covid-19 today is the vaccine, so, if you can, roll up your sleeve and get the shot.""",,,,1629283110,{},h9e83le,True,t3_p6ojpk,False,True,t3_p6ojpk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p6ojpk/alabama_doctor_refuses_to_treat_his_unvaccinated/h9e83le/,1629350354.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;The latest restrictions often fall short of those implemented earlier in the pandemic, which barred almost all visitation and left residents communicating through windows and cellphone screens. But the restrictions are a setback for families who hoped the worst was behind them after a mass-vaccination campaign sent cases plummeting earlier this year, and many rules were relaxed.

&gt;Mary Ellen Dayan-Varnum had been taking her 85-year-old mother, Jody Dayan, to a salon to get her hair done twice a week, but new restrictions at Ms. Dayan‚Äôs nursing home in Blountstown, Fla., have ended those outings.

&gt;Most visitation is canceled, and group activities like bingo, movies and communal dining have been suspended, leaving residents largely confined to their rooms. Ms. Dayan-Varnum can still visit her mother, who has dementia, under what is known as an essential-caregiver exemption. But she worries about the high case counts and low vaccination rates in the area.

&gt;Every day I have to explain to my mom why she can‚Äôt leave her room, why nobody is visiting her, why she can‚Äôt visit her friend across the hall,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere is no light at the end of the tunnel right now.‚Äù

&gt;Senior facilities in other states with Covid-19 surges‚Äîlike Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas‚Äîhave also had to bring back some visitation limits, industry groups say. Nursing-home officials say they are trying to employ restrictions selectively after blanket lockdowns last year compounded the pandemic‚Äôs strain for residents and their loved ones.

&gt;Nursing-home cases and deaths remain far below peaks reached last year, when long-term-care facilities represented more than a third of known Covid-19 deaths in the U.S. Hospitalizations are reaching pandemic highs in some hard-hit states, but the beds are often filling with younger people in this surge, and most are unvaccinated, health officials say.

&gt;However, the Delta variant-driven wave is putting fresh pressure on senior facilities, where many workers are hesitant to get vaccinated. While more than 82% of nursing-home residents throughout the U.S. were vaccinated by Aug. 1, the rate was 60% for nursing-home workers, federal data show.

&gt;I'd argue right now you're one of the 'people on reddit' generalizing scientific data by asserting you don't believe in a difference even though the scientific paper is literally asserting exactly that to be the case

I think what I said is in full agreement with the paper - I'm copying the relevant sections below. 

&gt;And to be clear I didn't post a 'news  piece' talking about the paper, I specifically posted the scientific journal itself for this reason.

Sorry, I didn't mean you - lots of redditors have been posting they are disappointed with Pfizer ""not working"" and such.

&gt;""Never read too much from one data set, peer reviewed or not."" so just ignore scientific data? Just go by gut instinct? We can only glean what is true or not true scientifically by studies like this.

Wait for more data and independent replications of the results. It's a bit of a cliche that scientists always say more data is needed but unfortunately it is also true. 

&gt; 50,000 is not a small data set. That's many multiples bigger than you want when looking for trends. 

I tried pointing out that in the 50k people, there were 15 vs 38 breakthrough infections. The data set is big overall, but the direct comparison is based on fairly small numbers. 

&gt;I could not begin to disagree with you more so I'll just leave by saying: I trust the Mayo Clinic over 'people on reddit'.

I'll reiterate my points once more by directly copy pasting from the actual paper. 

I said more data is needed, because the actual number of cases is fairly small. The paper says:

&gt;Similar real world clinical studies on larger and more diverse 
populations from various health systems are needed to more robustly compare the effectiveness 
of mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2.

I said the matching might not be exact. The paper says:

&gt;it is possible that our vaccine 
effectiveness estimates are impacted by unknown exposure risk variables which were missed in 
the matching procedure

I warned against concluding too much from one study. The paper puts this like this:

&gt;Our observational study suggests that while both mRNA COVID-19 vaccines strongly 
protect against infection and severe disease, there are differences in their real-world effectiveness 
relative to each other and relative to prior months of the pandemic. Larger studies with more 
diverse populations are warranted to guide critical pending public and global health decisions, 
such as the optimal timing for booster doses and which vaccines should be administered to 
individuals who have not yet received one dose. 

This study suggests something, and larger studies are needed. 

I 100% agree with what the paper says. I'm just saying that the paper doesn't actually say we now know for certain what the percentages and timelines are.

In particular, vaccinated over-50s are a bit over half of the total.  94.4% of over-50s are vaccinated, and those account for 56.6% of the over-50 hospitalizations.  This implies a (43.4/5.6)/( 56.6%/94.4) = 12.9x risk ratio = 92.2% efficacy against hospitalization with delta.   There are several confounding factors making this a bit inaccurate, but it's quite obvious that vaccines are highly effective.

That said, the over-50 fully-vaccinated CFR is over 1% (unvaccinated is 6%).  Breakthrough cases, when they happen in vulnerable people, need to be taken seriously.

That might be an aspect of cluster busting.

Tracing backwards to figure out how the student was infected will more likely hit a cluster of cases (which will also result in a high case positivity), and may be a better use of limited contact tracing resources.

Methods  
In June 2020, HWs in the Johns Hopkins Health System provided oral informed consent to participate in a longitudinal study of S1 spike antibodies in which serum samples and survey responses were collected every 3 to 4 months. Ethical approval was obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Review Board. The HWs who participated for a study visit between March 10 and April 8, 2021, were included in this analysis if their serum sample was collected 14 or more days after receiving dose 2 of either mRNA vaccine. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Euroimmun), IgG antibody measurements were determined based on optical density ratios with an upper threshold of 11 based on assay saturation.1 Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as having (1) a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test result prior to 14 days after dose 2 or (2) S1 spike IgG measurement greater than 1.23 prior to vaccination.5 Participants self-reported symptoms following vaccination as none, mild (injection site pain, mild fatigue, headache), or clinically significant (fatigue, fever, chills). Logistic regression models were used to explore the association of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine type with symptoms following each dose, adjusting for sex and age. A linear regression model was used to explore the association between magnitude of antibody response (log-transformed) and age, sex, prior infection, vaccine type, symptoms, and time after 2 doses of vaccine. Analyses were performed in R, version 4.0.2 (R Foundation).

A questionnaire and serum sample were collected 14 or more days following dose 2 for 954 HWs. Clinically significant symptoms were reported by 52 of the 954 (5%) after dose 1 and 407 (43%) after dose 2. After adjusting for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, age, and sex, the odds of clinically significant symptoms following either dose were higher among participants who received the Moderna vs the Pfizer vaccine (dose 1: odds ratio \[OR\], 1.83; 95% CI, 0.96-3.50; dose 2: OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.73-3.40) (Table). Prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure was associated with increased odds of clinically significant symptoms following dose 1 (OR, 4.38; 95% CI, 2.25-8.55) but not dose 2 (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.36-0.99), after controlling for vaccine type, age, and sex.  
  
Regardless of symptoms, the vast majority of participants (953 of 954, greater than 99.9%) developed spike IgG antibodies 14 or more days following dose 2; 1 participant who was taking immunosuppressant medication did not develop IgG antibodies (Figure). Reporting clinically significant symptoms, age younger than 60 years, female sex, receipt of Moderna vaccine, and prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure were independently associated with higher median IgG measurements, after adjusting for time after dose 2.  
  
Discussion  
Nearly 100% of HWs in this study mounted a strong antibody response to the spike protein after dose 2 of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine independent of vaccine-induced reactions. Clinically significant symptoms following dose 1 were associated with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirming prior reports.4 Clinically significant symptoms following vaccination were more frequent following dose 2 and receipt of the Moderna vaccine.3  
  
This study included participants within a longitudinal cohort study, leading to 2 potential limitations. First, the timing of survey collection may have led to recall bias and affected symptom reporting. Second, immune response was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and not neutralizing antibody titers.  
  
Spike IgG antibody measurements were higher in HWs who received the Moderna vaccine, had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, and reported clinically significant reactions. The role of higher antibody levels in preventing COVID-19 and providing lasting immunity remains unknown, however. Overall, the findings suggest that regardless of vaccine reactions or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, either spike mRNA vaccine will provide a robust spike antibody response.",,,,1629295655,{},h9esf9r,True,t3_p6ruqz,False,False,t3_p6ruqz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p6ruqz/association_of_vaccine_type_and_prior_sarscov2/h9esf9r/,1629360240.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have done EVERYTHING we can do.  My wife and I both work - exhausting, hard jobs.  She's in the clinic and MUST be there from 8am to 4pm every day.  Without exception.  I have a ton going on with my career as well.  

This is what we tried.

1)  No nanny, do virtual schooling.  Reality:  I work 6 out of 8 hours, my kid is on screens 6-10 hours a day, and does 5 minutes of work (and even that is torture). 

2)  Nanny, virtual schooling.  Reality:   Eldest refuses to do schooling.  Youngest sees eldest ""getting away with it"" and decides she too will not do schooling.   Take away screens etc - now everyone is miserable, all day long. We've done that too.

3)  Summer camps - they hate camps but it's better than being bored.  If she decides she does not want to go to camp, she will run away from the camp.  

4)  In person school - this is the best option.  They don't tolerate her bullshit behavior.  She's with her friends so her actions really matter.   Unfortunately with her mental health issues (oppositional defiant) she NEEDS to be in a school.

Unfortunately in America many parents work for a living and this is the result.  Without my wife working we wouldn't have health insurance.  And she doesn't have any desire to be a SAHM and entertain the kids all day (this is what they want and crave - Mom's attention 24/7).

No offense but I am betting either you don't have kids, you have amazing kids, or are a SAHP.  As NOBODY I have talked to thought that virtual school was a good idea, at all.

Slightly more nuanced than that. There is some right to self-determination. Choosing not to vaccinate however, in my mind, comes with giving up access to public places (schools, groceries, other stores, government buildings). The current US administration refusal to support RealID style vaccine certification is a problem. We also need professional enforcement. Police and other law enforcement should not be allowed to decide what laws to enforce - we need a way to send law enforcement who won't do their jobs home without pay, complicated by election of sheriffs for example in some jurisdictions.

The issue isn't that there are a small number of sick children, it's that the numbers of sick children are *rising rapidly*. Additionally, they cannot be protected currently.

Taken together, the studies show that although the vaccines remain highly effective against hospitalizations, the bulwark they provide against infection with the virus has weakened in the past few months.

It‚Äôs unclear whether the decline in protection against infection is the result of waning immunity, a drop in precautions like wearing masks, or the rise of the highly contagious Delta variant ‚Äî or a combination of all three.

‚ÄúWe are concerned that this pattern of decline we are seeing will continue in the months ahead, which could lead to reduced protection against severe disease hospitalization and death,‚Äù Dr. Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general, said at a White House news briefing on Wednesday.

Citing the data, federal health officials outlined a plan for Americans who received the two vaccines to get booster shots eight months after receiving their second doses, starting Sept. 20.

Some scientists were deeply skeptical of the new plan.

‚ÄúThese data support giving additional doses of vaccine to highly immunocompromised persons and nursing home residents, not to the general public,‚Äù said Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center and a former adviser on the pandemic to the administration.

Boosters would only be warranted if the vaccines were failing to prevent people from ending up hospitalized with Covid-19, she said.

‚ÄúFeeling sick like a dog and laid up in bed, but not in the hospital with severe Covid, is not a good enough reason,‚Äù Dr. Gounder said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be better protected by vaccinating the unvaccinated here and around the world.‚Äù

It‚Äôs unclear whether a third dose would help people who did not produce a robust response to the first two doses, said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

The recommendation for boosters may also end up undermining confidence in vaccines, he warned: ‚ÄúA third shot will add to skepticism among people yet to receive one dose that the vaccines help them.‚Äù

Together, the new studies indicate overall that vaccines have an effectiveness of roughly 55 percent against infections, 80 percent against symptomatic infection, and 90 percent or higher against hospitalization, noted Ellie Murray, an epidemiologist at Boston University.

‚ÄúThose numbers are actually very good,‚Äù Dr. Murray said. ‚ÄúThe only group that these data would suggest boosters for, to me, is the immunocompromised.‚Äù

The drop in protection against infection could be the result of increased exposure to a highly contagious variant during a period of unfettered social interactions, she added: ‚ÄúThis seems to me like a real possibility, since many early vaccinated were motivated by a desire to see friends and family and get back to normal.‚Äù

Dr. Murray said boosters would undoubtedly boost immunity in an individual, but the benefit may be minimal ‚Äî and obtained just as easily by wearing a mask, or avoiding indoor dining and crowded bars.

The administration‚Äôs emphasis on vaccines has undermined the importance of building other precautions into people‚Äôs lives in ways that are comfortable and sustainable, and on building capacity for testing, she and other experts said.

‚ÄúThis is part of why I think the administration‚Äôs focus on vaccines is so damaging to morale,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúWe probably won‚Äôt be going back to normal anytime soon.‚Äù

Before people can begin to receive boosters, the Food and Drug Administration must first authorize a third dose of the mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, and an advisory committee of the C.D.C. must review the evidence and make recommendations.

One of the new C.D.C. studies analyzed the effectiveness of vaccines among residents of nearly 4,000 nursing homes from March 1 to May 9, before the Delta variant‚Äôs emergence, and nearly 15,000 nursing homes from June 21 to Aug. 1, when the variant dominated new infections in the country.

The vaccines‚Äô effectiveness at preventing infections dropped from about 75 percent to 53 percent between those dates, the study found. It did not evaluate the vaccines‚Äô protection against severe illness.

Nursing homes were required to report the number of immunized residents only after June 6, which ‚Äúmakes comparisons over time very challenging,‚Äù Dr. Murray said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fully possible that the vaccine effectiveness reported here hasn‚Äôt actually declined over time.‚Äù

The decline in effectiveness also could have resulted from the spread of the Delta variant, Dr. Gounder said.

‚ÄúIt makes sense to give an extra dose of vaccine to vaccinated nursing home residents, but what will have an even bigger impact on protecting those nursing home residents is to vaccinate their caregivers,‚Äù she said. Many heath aides in long-term care facilities remain unvaccinated.

A second study evaluated data from New York State from May 3 to July 25, when the Delta variant grew to represent more than 80 percent of new cases. The effectiveness of vaccines in preventing cases in adults declined from 91.7 percent to 79.8 percent during that time, the study found. But the vaccines remained just as effective at preventing hospitalizations.

During those weeks, New York recorded 9,675 breakthrough infections ‚Äî roughly 20 percent of total cases in the state ‚Äî and 1,271 hospitalizations in vaccinated people, which accounted for 15 percent of all Covid-19 hospitalizations.

Although fully immunized people of all ages got infected with the virus, vaccine effectiveness showed the sharpest drop, from 90.6 percent to 74.6 percent, in people aged 18 through 49 years ‚Äî who are often the least likely to take precautions and the most likely to socialize.

Data from Israel has suggested that immunity against infection has waned among in vaccinated adults who are 65 or older. But in the New York data, the effectiveness of the vaccines in that group barely budged.

Adults ages 65 or older were more likely to be hospitalized than other age groups, regardless of vaccination status. But the vaccines did not show a decline in effectiveness against hospitalizations in any of the age groups.

The third study from the C.D.C. found that the vaccines showed 90 percent effectiveness against hospitalizations in the country, ‚Äúwhich is excellent,‚Äù Dr. Gounder noted.

The vaccines were less protective against hospitalization in immunocompromised people. ‚ÄúBut not all immunocompromised persons will respond to an additional dose of vaccine,‚Äù Dr. Gounder noted.

To protect these vulnerable individuals, everyone around them should be vaccinated and should continue to wear masks, she added.

The vaccines may appear to be less effective than they did in the clinical trials because the trials were conducted before the emergence of the highly contagious Delta variant. The vaccines can also seem to lose effectiveness as more unvaccinated people become infected with the virus and gain natural immunity.

If preventing infection is the goal, it would be wiser to offer a booster of a nasal spray vaccine, which is better at inducing immunity in the nose and throat, where the virus enters, Dr. Gounder said.

It really boils down to the concept of sterilizing immunity versus immunity from illness. Sterilizing immunity is when your immune response is strong enough to stop an infection from even taking hold. For a viral infection this would be mediated by your circulating serum and mucosal antibody levels. If they remain high enough the virus can be neutralized by those antibodies without ever taking hold. This means that you could be exposed to the virus without the rest of the immune system being activated again. The virus would enter, be bound by the antibodies that are already made, and there would be nothing left to stimulate an additional response. These antibodies are maintained by cells called long-lived plasma cells that sit in your bone marrow and act as antibody producing machines against whatever pathogen they were generated to fight. As their name suggests they are very long lived (on the order of decades to lifetimes typically though that can vary) and they are also very efficient at producing high antibody titers.

Now these cells may not always be enough. Either due to the amount of virus in the initial exposure, death of plasma cells over time, or just them not producing quite high enough titers to stop the infection. If this happens the virus would get past the initial response and actually infect you. This would trigger the rest of the immune response, and in this case since you were already vaccinated, mainly your memory T and B cells that would do their job again to restart antibody production and clear the infection. This would then act as a booster and generate a strong response again.

In your case since you are testing negative that likely means one of two things. 1. Your child isn't secreting enough virus and you haven't been truly exposed. 2. Your titers are high enough for sterilizing immunity and you aren't getting infected at all. So that likely means you are not getting a ""booster"" but it could mean the vaccine worked very well on you from the start.

Employees of those venues are also required to be vaccinated. Following a few weeks to transition, enforcement is slated to start Sept. 13.

&gt; Levels of antibodies as well as protection against infection are clearly shown to be waning after 6 months, this is not disputed, but it is not uniform across all populations.

I agree to a certain extent. I believe Delta has thrown a wrench in how we can analyze what level of antibodies are needed to prevent infection. I think this is moreso a case of lacking data.

&gt; This is why 8 months is very likely still on the early side of the window for the general population.

That's a fair assessment, especially given that vaccines have never been to prevent infection but to prevent serious illness.

It started with young kids but is non self sustained among the vaccinated population. Most cases of Covid in Israel are currently vaccinated individuals.  I tried linking an Israeli article detailing the numbers but the auto mod doesn't like the source.

Here's what it said:
COVID-19 cases have begun to rise in Israel over the last few weeks, reported Reuters. The outbreaks started in schools among unvaccinated children then began spreading to vaccinated adults.

Last week, Israel recorded an average of¬†[775 new daily cases](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/living-with-covid-19-israel-changes-strategy-delta-variant-hits-2021-07-13/)¬†last week, according to data from Reuters.

This is Israel‚Äôs highest number of daily new infections since March,¬†[Reuters](https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/israel/)¬†reported.

The average number of weekly hospital admissions is currently¬†[120 people](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/07/19/vaccine-skeptics-zero-israel-again-some-reason/), according to The Washington Post.

The country has reimposed mask mandates, social distancing requirements and quarantines for everyone arriving in Israel.

Just like in many other countries, the recent outbreak has been driven by the more contagious and ‚Äú[more vaccine-resistant](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/07/19/vaccine-skeptics-zero-israel-again-some-reason/)‚Äù delta variant, reported The Washington Post.

&gt;While the state is facing another surge rivaling January, Gov. Kay Ivey issued an emergency order Friday intending to help hospitals and health care workers respond to the pandemic, including allowing out-of-state doctors to practice in Alabama with expedited licensing or temporary permits.

&gt;About 90% of pregnant people in the study reported injection-site pain after the first and second dose of the vaccine, about the same percentage as non-pregnant people in the study, while 30% indicated they experienced fatigue after the first dose and 61% did so following the second, the data showed.   
          
&gt;Pregnant participants, overall, were half as likely to suffer serious symptoms of these side effects after either dose of the vaccine than those who were not pregnant, the researchers said.  
             
&gt;A report issued by agency researchers found that there are ""no safety concerns"" for any of the COVID-19 vaccines -- the two-dose Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech and the one-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson -- in pregnant people or those who are breastfeeding.   
           
&gt;Because of this data, the agency [revised its guidance](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2021/08/11/CDC-COVID-19-vaccines-safe-in-pregnant-people-those-who-breastfeed/2811628706522/) Aug. 11 to recommend that all pregnant people and those breastfeeding get vaccinated against the virus.  
         
&gt;For this study, Kachikis and her colleagues compiled side effect reports among roughly 7,800 people who were pregnant, 6,800 who were breastfeeding and 2,900 who were neither pregnant nor breastfeeding, but planned to become pregnant.

Unprecedented speed? Only because they're being compared to the FDA. Emergency use authorization for 5+ should have been out before the start of the school year. If the FDA had **any** legitimate worries about the vaccine then they should surface them. But there's no legitimate reason for this current delay. That's why the American Pediatrics Society has been [begging the FDA](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/pediatricians-plead-fda-move-quickly-covid-vaccine-kids-n1276191) to do their f***ing job. Back in November of last year, Pfizer was ready to go about a [week before Thanksgiving](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-submit-emergency-use-authorization) and because of Warp Speed the FDA had received ongoing updates and data from the studies material to approval as they became available. The FDA waited 3 full weeks to grant EUA. 3 critical weeks that delayed us getting shots into the arms into medical professionals until the January spike was in full effect. If we sort out our supply chain issues in early December, we get our Medical staff vaccinated in late December and elderly vaccinated in early January and we save thousands of lives. And in the end the FDA approved as quickly as they did because the Whitehouse [threatened to fire people](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-business-mark-meadows-coronavirus-pandemic-0902fbb041b0459e55da86be75b1457a). Without that pressure we likely wouldn't have seen vaccines until after Christmas.

The tougher stuff is when you think about other, harder to measure confounders: do vaxxed 40somethings look the same as unvaxxed 40somethings? Or are we missing other confounders...maybe people with pre existing conditions were more likely to vaxx up out of caution? Maybe unhealthy people were actually less likely to get vaxxed since they are less health conscious in general? Maybe, as Dvir Aran pointed out on Twitter, Delta his vaxxed folks in Israel faster because they live in areas exposed to more international travel? Maybe vaxxed people are less cautious since they feel more protected? Or more cautious because they are cautious types in general?

[],,ThrewTheDoor,,,[],,,,text,t2_cxksqcem,False,False,[],"I'm not sure where else to post this, as there is an element in the reporting on breakthrough cases of COVID that is driving me nuts because of how misleading the statement is.    
  
""Breakthrough infections in vaccinated people accounted for 20% of newly diagnosed cases.""  
  
Most people who read this will think:  ""Holy shit, even if I'm vaccinated, I have a 20% chance of getting COVID! 1 out of every 5 COVID cases is someone who is vaccinated!""  
  
No!    
  
Imagine two states, let's call them Fullvaxifornia and Halfvaxifornia. They each have a population of 100 people.     
  
In Vaxifornia, everyone is vaccinated.  Unfortunately, over the past year, there were 5 infections. And since everyone is vaccinated, all the infections are breakthrough infections.    
  
In Novaxifornia, only 50 people are vaccinated; the other 50 are not.  Unfortunately, over the past year, there were 30 infections.  3 of them were among vaccinated people, and 27 among unvaccinated.  
  
Now, from this data, it's obvious that the vaccine works very, very well -- only 5 people infected in a place where everyone is vaccinated, and 30 infections in a place where only half are vaccinated.  
  
But let's say we reported on these places using the same wording as the NYTimes article:  
  
""In Vaxifornia, breakthrough infections in vaccinated people accounted for 100% of all newly diagnosed cases.""  
  
""In Novaxifornia, breakthrough infections accounted for 10% of all newly diagnosed cases.""  
  
As you can see, the % of breakthrough infections in newly diagnosed cases is a completely meaningless statistic if you do not know what % of the population is vaccinated in the first place!  
  
So what should be reported instead?  
  
Instead, they should just report the raw ratios in comparison e.g. ""During COVID alpha, only 1 in 100 vaccinated people got COVID, while 30 in 100 unvaccinated people got COVID.  During COVID Delta, 10 in 100 vaccinated people got COVID, while 50 in 100 unvaccinated people got COVID.""  Reporting this way would simultaneously show that the vaccine is both less effective against Delta while ALSO showing that it is still extremely protective relative to not getting vaccinated at all.

COVID19 antibodies aren't ""attracted"" to their binding sites on a spike protein like magnets. An antibody passing by a spike protein will not be pulled from its trajectory to attach to it. If the antibody happens to be floating toward the protein and runs into it, it will bind it. So they're more like sticky notes than magnets. 

Wouldn't a drug like DRACO only be effective within a certain window of infection, where only a small number of cells are infected, so only those cells will undergo apoptosis (the technical term for a cell self-destructing) and the majority of cells (uninfected) are left alone. But what if the infection progresses to a large number of infected cells? Would DRACO induce cell death on such a massive scale that it destroys tissue?

The original paper even mentions this:

I went into my GP with classic lyme symptoms - joint pain, severe swelling in one leg, constantly tired, foggy and recalled pulling deer ticks off my dog 10 weeks prior.

""Tell me I'm an idiot that should stay off the internet, but I think I need a lyme test.  BTW - I've had both my covid shots.""

Round of antibiotics and yay - swelling and symptoms going down fast!  Yay!

Finished the antibiotics - and still feel crappy.  No huge swollen leg, but just drained.  Just wiped the heck out.

Also worth noting - my dog developed symptoms within a week of me.  Vet diagnosed lyme without even drawing blood based on where/when we were hiking and my obvious symptoms as I brought him in.  Dog recovered from a round of antibiotics, then also seems to be easily exhausted for a few weeks.  He's doing much better now.  

""Well that's not supposed to happen"" - doc about me feeling worse again.

Queue the next shit storm of billing, testing, 'we have no idea, might be cancer.   But I don't thnk it was lyme.'

So I'm not trying to get into any hotly contested ebate.  

My initial tick exposure about 20 weeks ago.  The ID specialist's position is he thinks I had lyme at least a year ago, and this is 'something else, but I have no idea what.  Probably not A or B, Maybe C or D.  But it could be A or B.  Or C (cancer).'

Thanks doc.  That's really helpful.

My point is that doctors aren't perfect geniuses.

I've learned more about which symptoms point to which types of cancer and a which point symptoms become diagnostically useful.  

I'd like to thank the UK's NHS system for determining when things should be referred to specialists for a wonderful troubleshooting guide. 

I recognize that I'm a barely educated moron.  I have to google the terms in the diagnostic criteria and am not reading advanced webMD for fun.  I'll be going back to my doc for another round of 'I still feel like crap.'  I won't appreciate 'could be cancer, but nothing big enough to look at.'

But believe me when I tell you I'm not spending hundreds of dollars out of pocket to be poked and prodded for psychosomatic problems.

I'd say we're a long ways from 'chronic lyme.'  I think we're still at the 'sucks you had it for 10 weeks before treatment and it sucks its taking a while for full recovery.'

I went right to the CDC - https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/signs_symptoms/index.html

I never had the rash.  2 days after tick bite and 23 days later I had my covid shots, so I thought headache / tired was just covid shot side effects and brushed it off.  Kept getting more tired, was sleeping 10-15 hours/day.  Sore all over, sometimes hot.  

Joints were getting sore.  Not bad when I first woke up, but worse with use.  Go hiking for 2.5 miles and my legs were creaky, everything sore - getting worse over the weeks.

(rheumatoid arthritis is usually worse when you wake up, loosening up with use - and both sides of the body - I used this to to suggest ruling it out to my primary care doc)

Then my right ankle started swelling - like I'd really hit it on something, but I hadn't.  Didn't really hurt, but sore.  Not hurt like sprained - just sore.  Then my knee.  

Biggest symptom that gave it away for me was the swelling on one side of my body.

I wish I'd caught it earlier - if you've got the tired / headachey crap and were in a deer tick area, I'd recommend asking for the blood test.

We have tickets to a December NFL game and he texted me yesterday saying he hopes the Raiders vaccine requirement doesn't become a league-wide policy.  I replied that *I* have nothing to worry about (been fully vaccinated for months, will get the booster when/if it comes around).  Sad and rather pathetic that he would rather be bullheaded than join the crowd and get to see his beloved team play (when all the coaches and most of the players are themselves vaccinated).

What makes all of this even more confounding is that back in February of 2020, just as shit was starting to hit the fan here in the US, he had a mysterious illness that caused a number of Covid-like symptoms and actually spent a couple days in the hospital despite being an otherwise healthy thirtysomething.  At that time, they weren't testing for Covid and his flu and pneumonia tests came back negative.  He never took an antibody test, but he was convinced at the time that he was an early Covid case.  I assume he thinks that this gives him immunity, but we know that it doesn't necessarily work like that with Delta.  But I guess, for him, getting the shots is beyond the pale because \*insert some mental gymnastics-derived contrarian excuses\*.

It seems like the endgame is ""when enough people get vaccinated"" (which apparently could be upwards of 90% of the population).  This isn't going to happen.  Not that I'm actively wishing for people to get sick and die, I genuinely wish we could avoid so much suffering, but plenty of people aren't going to be convinced to vaccinate unless they see some nightmare Covid outcomes truly hit home (family or neighbors or co-workers who thought they were also immune from becoming seriously ill).

The majority of people currently dying have been vaccinated. So all these posts saying ""no sympathy for the dead"" are pretty horrible. 

Vaccines reduce the spread, but the problem is they require a strong immune system to work properly. Lots of old people don't have strong immune systems, as these age just like every other system in the body. 

Would you expect a 75 year old to have the cardiovascular system of a 25 year old? 

It's the same with the immune system. 

Old people have less effective t cells, which means a delayed or reduced antibody response to infection. 

Taking vaccines does protect the vulnerable, but it doesn't make them invulnerable to infection/ death.

Example: You statistically expect 100 cases of infection in a specific situation.  
- if activity ‚Äúa‚Äú gives 50% protection you will have only 50 cases.   
- if adding activity ‚Äúb‚Äù gives 100% more protection *than activity ‚Äúa‚Äù alone* it _doubles_ the protection of activity ‚Äúa‚Äù, so you will only have 25 cases.  
- if adding activity ‚Äúc‚Äù gives an additional 900% protection *than activity a and activity b* you will only have 2.5 cases.  

If you have 250% more protection you divide the number of expected cases by (1+2.5) which is (3.5). The 1 on the left is representing all cases (100%) you expect without the activity, the number on the right is the improvement.

If the activity gives no additional protection (0%), the number of cases would just stay the same, so it would be numberOfCases / (1+0).

[],,jsinkwitz,,,[],,,,text,t2_rdw7k,False,True,[],"""Masked and ready to start the new academic year, students in Austin‚Äôs Eanes Independent School District returned to campuses excited to reunite with friends and meet their new teachers.  
‚ÄúCampus principals report several ‚Äòmagical moments,‚Äô"" Tom Leonard, the superintendent, said in a note to parents and staff on Tuesday, one day before the district‚Äôs first day of school.  
But there were also ‚Äúa few sad moments‚Äù at recent school events, he qualified.  
Some parents physically and verbally assaulted teachers because of masks. One parent ripped a teacher‚Äôs mask off her face, Leonard said. Others yelled at another teacher to remove her mask because they claimed it made it difficult to understand what she was saying.  
‚ÄúThis type of behavior will not be tolerated in Eanes ISD,‚Äù Leonard wrote Tuesday. ‚ÄúOur staff are on the front lines of this pandemic; let‚Äôs give them some space and grace. Please, I am asking everyone to be kind ‚Ä¶ do not fight mask wars in our schools.‚Äù

The incidents reflect the growing tensions around mask mandates in schools as students return for the new academic year while coronavirus cases surge. Last week, a parent in California allegedly yelled at a school principal over mask requirements and then struck a teacher. The parent is now banned from school grounds.

Covid cases in Texas continue to rise, driven by the highly contagious delta variant. In the past week, cases rose 11 percent and hospitalizations increased by 21 percent, according to The Washington Post‚Äôs coronavirus tracker. Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who has pushed to ban mask mandates in schools, announced Tuesday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus.  
  
Earlier this month, the state requested five mortuary trailers as hospitals anticipate a dramatic spike in covid-related deaths. As of Monday, the Austin area had only three available intensive care unit beds, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services covid dashboard. Deaths in the state have jumped by more than 64 percent in the last week, data from The Post‚Äôs covid-19 tracker shows.

Despite the dramatic increase and evidence showing that children are now more likely to contract the virus because of the more contagious delta variant, executive orders from Republican governors banning mask mandates have restricted some schools‚Äô protective measures. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends students, teachers and staff at K-12 schools wear masks indoors.  
  
Some counties in Texas, including Travis County ‚Äî the home of Eanes ISD ‚Äî have defied the governor‚Äôs order. Earlier this week, the Dallas Independent School District superintendent said schools would require students and staff to wear face coverings despite the Texas Supreme Court siding with the governor in a battle over mask mandates. Similarly, Bexar County in San Antonio will also require masks in public and private schools after a judge there granted a temporary injunction on Abbott‚Äôs executive order.  
  
Stephanie Elizalde, the superintendent of Austin Independent School District wrote in an essay for Time that she was mandating masks because the situation in the city is ‚Äúdire.‚Äù

‚ÄúI cannot live with a tragedy occurring because I was afraid of the possible consequences of defying part of the governor‚Äôs order,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúI realize, of course, that the governor‚Äôs executive order may mean that we will be fined for requiring masks. I‚Äôd rather pay money than risk a child‚Äôs life.‚Äù

At least four school districts in the state have closed over covid outbreaks.  
  
Gorman Independent School District, about 100 miles southwest of Fort Worth, was supposed to resume school on Wednesday, but the superintendent announced Monday the district was pushing the start date to Aug. 25. The Bloomburg school district in East Texas also announced Monday it was closing for a week after several teachers tested positive for the coronavirus just eight days into the academic year. An elementary school in Waskom, Tex., a town of almost 2,000 people about 60 miles south of Bloomburg, also temporarily shut down this week, along with Iraan-Sheffield Independent School District in the western part of the state.

In his note to the Eanes ISD community, superintendent Leonard noted that wearing masks in schools is vital to preventing hospitalizations since ‚Äúmedical personnel are under extreme pressure,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚ÄúWe are doing our part to help.‚Äù  
  
Leonard went on to applaud the ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù of students and staff who have been wearing masks on school grounds.  
  
‚ÄúMandate or no mandate ‚Ä¶ children and adults in our schools are doing what they believe is best for themselves and our community,‚Äù he said.  
  
Leonard implored community members to refrain from violence, regardless of whether they agree with mask policies.  
  
‚ÄúThe children are watching and learning how we behave,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúso let‚Äôs make the time our students spend in school a joyful and positive experience.‚Äù",,,,1629295237,{},h9erk3r,True,t3_p6rp5p,False,True,t3_p6rp5p,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p6rp5p/after_texas_parent_rips_mask_off_teachers_face/h9erk3r/,1629359829.0,38,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

She could hear every haunted exhalation he made, a sound halfway between a snore and a scream of pain.

&gt;It was not her first such vigil. But the knowledge that the patient was unvaccinated made it, somehow, bleaker than the rest.

&gt;As part of an emergency response team maintained by the federal government, the 59-year-old nurse has deployed more than a dozen times during the Covid-19 pandemic, to hospitals, clinics, and even cruise ships. It seemed impossible that the death rituals that have defined her nightmarish 18-month world tour could become more grim. But the current wave, and the utter needlessness of the patient suffering Ingle bears witness to each day, are more devastating than ever.

&gt;Now, she is unhooking IV drips from the body of a patient who could have lived. As she removes his catheter, slips off his blood-oxygen sensor, and switches off the monitor that had displayed his heart rate and blood pressure, she admits to experiencing a new level of trauma. Treating coronavirus patients in a post-vaccine world, she says, has added an entirely new layer of despair.

&gt;‚ÄùNinety-nine percent of the patients being admitted are unvaccinated,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre sicker when they get here. They require more acute care while they‚Äôre here. And unfortunately, many of them are not surviving.‚Äù

&gt;STAT‚Äôs rare access to a Covid-19 intensive care ward, a glimpse inside a hospital under siege, highlights the devastation being wrought not only on patients, but also on health workers. Throughout two days spent shadowing Ingle and her colleagues ‚Äî a unit within the National Disaster Medical System, effectively a National Guard for health care and emergency response ‚Äî it became readily apparent that she and her colleagues had received perhaps their toughest deployment yet.

There was definitely a concern ADE could happen, as it was observed with other beta coronaviruses like SARS and MERS, and with other viruses like dengue and FIPV.

If it was actually happening, or if the virus mutated to be able to employ ADE for entry, you'd see a huge spike in cases in people who are vaccinated or have had the virus before. We're not seeing that, so safe to say that the current strains of SARS-CoV-2 cannot use ADE.

2. Remote learning in the district. Painful, with kids on their Chromebooks most of the day and needing to be monitored. Especially our youngest, who needs more work on reading. But we'd have access to the school services, including speech therapy and whatnot, and the curriculum and grading would be handled for us. Painful, but doable. 
3. Ditch the district, home-school. Requires a massive time investment. Ultimately not reasonable right now. 

Given the options, we went with option 2. We made it work last year - it was painful, but we made it work.

Again, these numbers are higher now because this is 9 days ago. That's the bad news. 

The good news in that this is a tiny fraction of people when you consider that 166,000,000 people have been fully vaccinated. They are still all people, and it is still tragic, but when you look at the numbers the actual danger to vaccinated people of ending up in hospital or worse, dead, is still ridiculously low.

There's a mapping from the raw scores on the test (i.e. the number of questions right) to IQ scores, so that the average raw score is associated to an IQ of 100.

[],,Feralogic,,,[],,,,text,t2_1dalrk72,False,False,,"Not an expert, but from what I understand, the mRNA vaccines train the body to recognize the spike protein on the outside of the Covid virus. More infectious versions had more spikes, so were more ""sticky"" but the *shape* of the spikes can't change too much, otherwise it won't fit our human receptor cells. Kind of like a key to a lock. This key fits primates, as well as cats and ferrets and bats. (That's why snow leopards at the San Diego Zoo got infected, but so far, no elephants that I have heard of?) Covid-19 is interesting in that it seems to ""fit"" a lot of animal species, but it obviously grows especially well in humans.

The current vaccine works against Delta, because the vaccine still recognizes the outer spikes. The Delta strain fought back by releasing MASSIVE amounts of virus up front. Your vaccinated body holds antibodies for a while after a shot (*or booster.) Then they fade. But the vaccine gives your body the memory of how to make more, when needed. The previous strains invaded more gradually, allowing our vaccine to perform beautifully, which is why things were looking rosy back in May.

Delta slams into the body so fast and so hard, that if you don't have enough antibodies on hand, ready to use, that even vaccinated people can end up sick. Some vaccinated even get admitted to the hospital, but with enough support that usually buys enough time for the body to fight back.

Delta makes sick people spew out way, way more virus particles out of their lungs than previous versions, which means one day at work or school with an infected person in more likely to cause spread than before. Original Covid-19 wasn't all that infectious, which is probably why it floated around Italy and a few US states undetected for a while at the start of the pandemic. 

Sadly, the unvaccinated don't have antibodies on hand,, and they also don't have the ""recipe"" given by the vaccine that instructs the body on how to fight. Delta overwhelms even strong, healthy bodies, with heavy viral load, right from the start, which is why younger people are struggling with it.

This is why masks help, even in vaccinated, because if we can get less Delta particles physically shoved in our nose/lungs up front, it may result in more mild cases. It's so infectious that probably you will still get it, if exposed, even if you're vaccinated. However, I already know of two vaccinated folks who tested positive, but have zero symptoms. (They only got tested because they were around an unvaccinated person who got sick and was showing symptoms.) 

Delta is going to be raging for a while, especially with kids going back to school. Until more people get infected and recover, or get vaccinated, and especially until KIDS can get vaccinated, it's just gonna be rough out there.

We are not getting stronger and stronger flu's because thats not really how the flu virus works. With the flu virus you have 8 genes. Two of the genes are key for determining disease. The ""H"" component which allows the virus to enter the cell and the ""N"" component which allows the virus to leave the cell, e.g. H1N1, H3N2). Each year different H's and N's combine to form different types of flu's. Some combinations work better together to allow the virus to enter the cell, replicate, and cause disease others not so much. Sometimes we get a novel combination that hasn't really been seen before and the population is more vulnerable. This usually happens when the virus or a component of the virus makes a species jump, from birds to people or pigs to people (hence the terms Avian flu, or Swine flu). Still we are offered some protection. Even if the virus makes the species jump it must mutate within us to be able to spread from person-to-person. On top of all this is the flu vaccine whose effectiveness partially depends on how well we predict the dominant strain of flu virus will be that year. Sometimes we get it right, sometimes we get it wrong. Vaccines doesn't really drive the selection of the type of flu strain we get. Its more about random combination, influence from the environment (e.g. exposure to domestic animals like poultry and swine), and spread amongst the population. Thats why some years we have a flu virus that is relatively mild and other years a flu virus that can be more deadly. You have different combinations of H's and N's, the novelty of those combinations, and their origins. 

Coronaviruses are very different types of viruses. They work in different ways. We don't have effective treatments or vaccines against them (or at least, not really prior to 2019). I don't pretend to know as much about Coronaviruses as I do about the Influenza virus but I can assure you their comparison really starts and ends with the word 'virus'.",,,,1629311615,{},h9fry4w,False,t3_p6g9k4,False,False,t1_h9egkjd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p6g9k4/unvaccinated_meet_the_unsympathetic_most/h9fry4w/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,1eeb553404d942a9ac35e4fcee0cb730b4a97546,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1629311626.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Is there an end at all at this point? (Specifically for the US for now but I'm definitely also curious about worldwide.) Is there any scientific consensus around that? 

I'm an optimist by nature so I'm hoping still that the answer is yes. A little search seems to indicate herd immunity takes hold when 70-90% of a population are protected. 

Currently 51% of US population is vaccinated. 

It also appears approximately 10% of the US population has had the disease. Can I add those two numbers together to say 61% are protected from the disease and therefore we're only as little as 9% away from herd immunity? 

Similarly, it seems like New Zealand has all but ""beaten"" COVID. Just 1 case now and it's the first in months? Well done! Are there any other countries that are doing that well?

Second, about 93% of adults are vaccinated. This means there are over 10x more vaccinated people than unvaccinated people.

Meaning that 7% of the country is making up more that 33% of cases. This demonstrates CLEARLY that as an individual you are far less likely to get it if you are vaccinated. 

For example, taking the data you posted, let's look at the most recent peak day for infections. About 95 cases in vaccinated people occurred that day. 95 infections for (about) 95% of the country's vaccinated adults. That's about 1 infection for every 1% of the adult population. Now, same day, there were about 45 cases amongst unvaccinated people. 45 cases in about 7% of the population means about 6.24 infections per every 1% of the population. 

If you are unvaccinated, per the data you suggest, you are about 6.24x more likely to get COVID in Iceland right now.

It confuses me that the administration is claiming that this had no basis on their decision, since this is the timing which Pfizer is submitting to the FDA for approval. It was my mistake to conflate the Pfizer submission of this booster schedule as the reason that the US chose this timing. So they are saying it's purely coincidental? I will edit to clarify that I am not making claims about the administration's logic, only observing what Pfizer is submitting.

In regards to whether or not you consider this timing conservative, I suppose that's a matter of opinion. Levels of antibodies as well as protection against infection are clearly shown to be waning after 6 months, this is not disputed, but it is not uniform across all populations. This is very likely why Israel is boosting those over 60, and why the USA is ready to boost the immunocompromised, as this is the beginning of their window of waning protection. The only way that this may also be the beginning of the window of waning for the population at large is if people outside these categories see the same loss of protection, and the same levels of antibodies after the same time. This is not what we observe, which means the beginning of the general populations window of waning protection is necessarily after this point, on average. This is why 8 months is very likely still on the early side of the window for the general population.

That being said, in such a fast moving situation, I am fully willing to retract this position in light of evidence which shows that there is not a difference in outcomes across cohorts, implying a convergence of waning protection times.",,,,1629321336,{},h9gdlbo,False,t3_p6sfsy,False,False,t1_h9g7r77,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p6sfsy/us_announces_plan_to_offer_boosters_to_all/h9gdlbo/,1629390242.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

That is not what people mean when they say ""outsourcing"". And again, if they want to move to contractors they already can, but doing that has a cost. Contractors already have insanely high turnover. You yourself are also not vetting the contractors but relying on an outside agency to do the vetting. 

I work with contractors daily. A lot of them are great, but there's damn near an equal number that should never have been hired. They also bounce around A LOT more than normal employees. 

&gt;It is not really about sucking at your job, it is more a value proposition to the company that hires.

It is about not sucking at your job. Most places will be looking to replace you after 5-10 years regardless, and you should be looking to move on within that frame anyway unless you really like your job. If you do a good enough job your employer will usually not bother looking for replacements. 

You're also neglecting that as more employers pick up remote work, the employees also have more options.  It doesn't only work one way, and again, employers that refuse to offer remote are going to be getting left behind as the more talented people have more options and choose places that offer remote.

If there's nothing stopping these people from going about their lives, why should they get vaccinated? If we want to stop the virus, we have to coerce more of these people, regardless of whether it's through business regulations, vaccine mandates, or other restrictions. Plus, our official messaging has been placing far too much emphasis on the personal need for vaccination and not enough on what vaccination means for the community. The whole community gets vaccinated should mean that life can go back to normal: hospitals will be fine, people can go to fairs and concerts and backyard BBQs and bars.

The trouble is, if those people have been doing all of that all this time, what does being vaccinated give them? Nothing that they care about.

Some people would call him selfish, but on the grand scale of things, his motives do not matter. What matters is that he's going to be vaccinated and that's one less person who won't be taking up healthcare resources and that he is still helping his community.

Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas tested positive for the coronavirus on Tuesday, though he has no symptoms, the governor‚Äôs office announced.

An ardent opponent of mask and vaccine mandates, Mr. Abbott, a Republican, has taken his opposition to such requirements all the way to the state Supreme Court. Mr. Abbott, who is fully vaccinated, will now be isolated in the Governor‚Äôs Mansion while receiving monoclonal antibody treatment, which can help Covid-19 patients who are at risk of getting very sick.

‚ÄúThe governor has been testing daily, and today was the first positive test result,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúGovernor Abbott is in constant communication with his staff, agency heads, and government.‚Äù

At least 10 other sitting governors ‚Äî four Democrats and six Republicans ‚Äî have tested positive for the coronavirus since the pandemic began, according to reports compiled by Ballotpedia; so have four lieutenant governors, all Republicans.

Vaccinations in Texas lag behind those of many other states, and coronavirus deaths are rising, though far more slowly than in prior waves, given that a majority of the state‚Äôs oldest and most vulnerable residents are now vaccinated. The state has averaged more than 14,700 new cases a day as of Monday, an increase of 53 percent from two weeks earlier, according to a New York Times database.

Mr. Abbott, 63, has faced withering criticism as coronavirus cases have increased sharply in Texas and available intensive-care beds have dwindled in Austin and other cities. But he maintained his ban on mask mandates, which prohibits local officials from imposing restrictions in their communities.

Fear and frustration over the course of the pandemic in Texas, the nation‚Äôs second most populous state, come as schools are preparing to reopen, raising worries about further spread of the virus.

Last month, responding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issuing new guidance recommending that fully vaccinated people need to wear a mask indoors in high-risk areas, Mr. Abbott doubled down in the opposite direction. He issued an executive order that prohibited local governments and state agencies from mandating vaccines, and reaffirmed previous decisions to prohibit local officials from mandating masks.


The governor also affirmed that schools could not impose mask mandates for students; some public health experts warned that the ban could lead to another surge in cases.

Late on Friday, after Mr. Abbott‚Äôs ban suffered at least three legal setbacks, the state attorney general, Ken Paxton, said he was taking the issue to the State Supreme Court. The setbacks were in areas with Democratic leaders, rampant coronavirus cases and rising hospitalizations.

The State Supreme Court then sided with the state on Sunday, granting a request for an emergency stay of an appellate court ruling that would have allowed schools to make face coverings mandatory.

As the virus surged, the Texas Department of State Health Services requested five mortuary trailers from the federal government on Aug. 4 ‚Äúas a precaution,‚Äù Douglas Loveday, a spokesman for the state health department, said in an emailed statement. The mortuary trailers will be kept in San Antonio, though none have been requested by cities or counties as of Tuesday, he said.

The five trailers are scheduled to arrive in Texas beginning on Friday, according to a spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",,,,1629237471,{},h9c9brx,False,t3_p6dfm2,False,True,t3_p6dfm2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p6dfm2/gov_greg_abbott_of_texas_tested_positive_for_the/h9c9brx/,1629312857.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;Pentagon spokesman [John Kirby told reporters](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/2734898/pentagon-press-secretary-john-f-kirby-holds-a-press-briefing/) Tuesday the teams will include about 20 medical personnel, including doctors, nurses and respiratory therapists.  
      
&gt;The first medical assistance team will be deployed to Lafayette, Louisiana, a state which has the highest recent COVID-19 death rate and one of the lowest recent vaccination rates nationwide, [The New York Times database shows](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html).    
          
&gt;The Federal Emergency Management Agency and the state of Louisiana requested the response amid the recent COVID-19 surge.   
          
&gt;""We expect that there could be additional requests from other states for other teams,"" Kirby said. ""And so that's why we're being prepared to stand up five teams.""  
      
&gt;Along with Louisiana, other southern states -- including Florida, Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas -- have ranked among the five highest rates of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations per 100,000 people across the country in the last seven days, according to the Times database.

[],,M4X7MU5,,,[],,,,text,t2_13qjmh,False,False,,"A few weeks ago, Lydia Rodriguez thought her body was strong enough to fight the coronavirus without the vaccine.But after a week-long church camp, she and other members of her family tested positive for the coronavirus. By the time Rodriguez, 42, changed her mind and asked for the shot, it was too late, her doctor said. A ventilator awaited her, her cousin Dottie Jones told The Washington Post.Out of options, the Galveston, Tex., mother of four, asked her family to make a promise: ‚ÄúPlease make sure my kids get vaccinated,‚Äù Rodriguez, a piano teacher, told her sister during their last phone call.Rodriguez died Monday ‚Äî two weeks after her husband, Lawrence Rodriguez, 49, also died after coronavirus complications. The couple fought the virus from hospital beds just a few feet from one another in a Texas intensive care unit, Jones said.Lydia and Lawrence Rodriguez, who were married for 21 years, were among the tens of millions of Americans who have not yet received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine, which is available free to anyone over age 12. Health officials have stressed that the vaccine significantly lowers one‚Äôs chance of becoming severely ill or dying of the virus. The now-orphaned children of the Rodriguez family join the millions tragically affected by the sometimes deadly illness.The case of the Rodriguez family echoes that of other unvaccinated patients who have begged their doctors for vaccine doses before being intubated.‚ÄòI should have gotten the damn vaccine,‚Äô woman says fiance texted before he died of covid-19‚ÄúLydia has never really believed in vaccines,‚Äù Jones, 55, told The Post. ‚ÄúShe believed that she could handle everything on her own, that you didn‚Äôt really need medicine.‚ÄùA neonatal nurse, Jones was familiar with the serious effects covid-19 had on mothers and babies she treated at the Sugarland, Tex., hospital where she worked. She shared with Rodriguez how she had watched patient after patient be connected to a ventilator for weeks without much improvement.Jones could have gone on and on. But her cousin‚Äôs silence spoke for itself, she said.‚ÄúI knew she would never get vaccinated,‚Äù Jones told The Post. ‚ÄúI was very concerned.‚ÄùRodriguez‚Äôs husband, who shared her anti-vaccine beliefs, also declined to get the shot. Three of their four children are eligible but have not yet received the vaccine, Jones said.In early July, days after Rodriguez and the children returned from a Christian church camp, Jones‚Äôs worst fears became true. One by one, each member of the family ‚Äî including Rodriguez‚Äôs husband, who did not attend camp because of work ‚Äî tested positive for the coronavirus.The family didn‚Äôt tell anyone they were sick until Rodriguez‚Äôs husband drove her to the hospital on July 12 after she began experiencing shortness of breath. Rodriguez was admitted to the ICU, and her husband was admitted to another ward, Jones said.By then, the rest of the family stepped in to bring groceries and medicine to the couple‚Äôs four children, who were all infected and quarantining at home. The youngest child was the only one to experience mild symptoms, Jones said. The rest were asymptomatic.At one point, Lawrence Rodriguez‚Äôs condition appeared to be improving, but a couple of days after he was admitted, he was rushed to the ICU. He requested a coronavirus vaccine shortly before being put on a ventilator, Jones said, but it was also too late for him. He died Aug. 2.By then, Lydia Rodriguez was fully dependent on an oxygen mask that prevented her from talking to her children, who called to check in and sing Christian hymns to lift her spirits.‚ÄúWe are praying for you and taking care of the kids,‚Äù Jones recounted telling her cousin during her last days. Hospital staff called the family on Aug. 16 to report that Rodriguez had died.The family has relayed her last wishes about the vaccine to the couple‚Äôs 18-year-old twins, Jones said. The plan is to schedule an appointment for the 11-year-old daughter as soon as she qualifies, and the couple‚Äôs 16-year-old son is expected to get the shot soon.The family has created an online fundraiser to help the Rodriguez children while the courts figure out who will become the guardian of the minors.Wednesday is expected to be a difficult day for the four siblings, Jones said.

Now moving on to Israel and Gibraltar; first of all the news source you cited seems to be a ridiculous anti-vax conspiracy site. Good start. Second, it talks about a percent increase to ignore the fact that in gibraltar, this wave peaked at 33 new cases per day and already crashed back down. Third, ""if you didn't know"" is moot because we do know. We can see the data that per capita, severe infection and death are far more likely in unvaccinated populations.

Pfizer's first treatment has to be IV administered, so hospital settings only. It is a derivative of a protease inhibitor developed as a result of research on the original SARS-CoV-1 virus.

its like, ""dude, you guys are the ones making it hard for us to get enough vaccines, we had no choice but to aim for zero covid until we get enough vaccines, yet you are here mocking us, wth""

our country already spent a couple decades worth of tax dollars in the past year, its irresponsible to continue to throw more money just because a few individual cant be bothered to put on a mask

just wear the mask a while longer and save a bunch of cash

theres also a moral matter which the UN chief kept highlighting (and getting ignored over) that the hoarding of vaccines by rich nations are making the matter worse for poorer nations",,,,1629257540,{},h9dcu81,False,t3_p5yj23,False,False,t1_h9blg3w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p5yj23/new_zealand_to_enter_nationwide_lockdown_after_1/h9dcu81/,1629334196.0,17,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of UK deaths were vaccinated to delta. This is because 94% of the most vulnerable, elderly population was fully vaccinated. It's higher now, but I'm averaging over the time period. The 6% that weren't vaccinated  contributed over a third of all the deaths. Mostly old people die to this disease, by orders of magnitude.

If you have a larger amount of that vulnerable population unvaccinated, they instead will dominate deaths. With 22 percent unvaccinated vs 6 percent in the uk, you end up with over 4 times the deaths in general, and instead of 6 percent giving you a disproportionate  33 percent of deaths 22 percent yields 80 percent.

I know what the American Academy of pediatrics said and I agree that everyone being in-person is the most ideal in a *normal world* however the reality is that a lot of school districts are not doing what needs to be done to make in-person learning safe for kids, teachers, and the community at large. Parents shouldn‚Äôt have to throw their kids into the grinder just because there are no alternatives. Teachers shouldn‚Äôt be forced to put their lives and/or health at risk either. 

Obviously,  keeping kids home is not ideal for social development but we are living through a historic moment and things are going to have to be different if we‚Äôre going to survive as a nation, and for many, as individuals.

However, I also know that because of the way our society is set up there are many parents who cannot reasonably afford to do virtual schooling without appropriate supports from work and the government (unemployment payments, stimulus checks, etc.) 

A remote option benefits parents who want to keep their kids home and those who cannot; the less kids in school right now the better. It will be easier to social distance the kids who have to be in-school and can therefore only help mitigation. 

(And it doesn‚Äôt have to be the in-school teacher doing both. Our district has a digital Academy and has for several years that we are doing this year.)

Maybe it was just wishful thinking that things would be better by now but I don‚Äôt understand why districts didn‚Äôt prioritize improving digital options just in case. The way things are looking now it looks like a lot of schools are going to have to be digital for some of the year anyway.

My dog was diagnosed with cancer and eventually died, and I wasn't allowed to be with him at the vet appointments.   The stress of not being able to be with him when he was euthanized was something that wore on me for a long time, but I was able to find someone who was willing to do it outside, in December.   I bought a bunch of portable heaters and setup a canopy medical tent.   I spend a ton of energy that last week trying to arrange that when I should have been in the moment with my dog.

Technically I could have secretly met with large groups at a private residences and not gotten in trouble or anything, but, I followed the rules and my friends followed the rules.   My social life was trivia night zooms every so often, and one neighbor friend whose yard I'd have some beers in.

And it kind of just disrupted everything I found comfort in, that gave me those boosts that help you work past life stress.  Movies, dog parks, gatherings, traveling, volunteering, parties, breweries, group camping trips, park outings, restararunats, happy hours with co-workers.  All gone for a long time, still haven't fully returned.  There are many things and people that used to be a part of my life that still haven't really returned.  One of my best friends who moved away just cancelled her flight back to visit, and a group camping trip I was really looking forward to got cancelled, both because of the rise of cases and people's reluctance to be in groups.  The happy hours with co-workers haven't returned.   I'm still a lot more isolated than I was last March.

I don't mind masks for things like shopping and traveling, but I do think they hugely impact how we relate to people when we can't see each other's faces, smiles, conversation cues, etc.   Everything is more distant.

We had the same restrictions most cities did.   And my friends are all regular people who took COVID very seriously, and many still do.   I don't anymore.  I have been traveling and everything.

Here is what they would likely be charged with, if at all:

&gt;Class C misdemeanor

&gt;If the defendant threatens the victim with bodily harm or makes non-injurious physical contact in an offensive or provocative manner, assault is charged as a class C misdemeanor. This carries a fine of up to $500.

There's also this, provided the teacher was considered a public servant, but I doubt that the DA would pursue this charge:

&gt;Third degree felony

&gt;Assault may be charged as a third degree felony if:

&gt;The victim has a domestic relationship with the defendant and the defendant has previously been convicted of a similar crime.

&gt;The defendant knowingly assaults a security officer performing his or her duties.

&gt;The defendant knowingly assaults a public servant or family services contractor within the course of duty or in retaliation for performing his or her duty.

&gt;The defendant assaults an emergency services worker in the course of his or her duty.

&gt;This level of offense carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and fine of up to $10,000.

It feels like the pressure is being taken off of the government for approval because of our overestimation of the protective effects of masks in a long duration group setting with a mostly unvaccinated population. Political polarization has lionized the one most visible NPI at the expense of all the others. Retrospectively, the contribution to the cumulative effect of masks as part of a comprehensive NPI strategy has been estimated to be about 20%. Removing all of the other NPIs tested during the winter like hybrid learning, isolated student pods, and quarantine rules won't give us the result we want, especially in the face of a much more transmissible variant. Instead of spending our energies thinking about how we can most effectively educate kids remotely, or shift the educational calendar, we are choosing to fight over a single NPI strategy that, as pretty much all studies note, needs to be combined with other NPIs for full effectiveness.

Sure, we can bring everyone back and use masks to reduce the doubling time of the average transmission. The effect against the original strain reduced the doubling time of cases in the average American school from 2 to 14 hours. But with a more transmissible variant, this level of reduction probably means that we get a month of school before everyone is infected instead of a couple of days, masks vs no masks.

[],,CosmicCuttl3fish,,,[],,,,text,t2_93c75wbf,False,False,[],"If you look back before the mRNA vaccine results came out, the FDA set a threshold of only 50% to consider the vaccine ‚Äúeffective‚Äù, so if the first vaccines were for example 56% effective, they would have been approved. The efficacy we are seeing against delta still is above that original threshold.

We got very lucky and the mRNA vaccines way surpassed that 50%, but 2 unfortunate things happened. Because the vaccines were so effective against wild type, the federal government tried turning COVID into a personal responsibility issue instead of a public health issue. The vaccines were considered to be somewhat of a ‚Äúforcefield‚Äù against Covid so whether you were at risk of getting sick or not was considered to be determined by whether you ‚Äútook responsibility‚Äù for your health (they used that exact term) and got vaccinated. When the CDC removed the mask recommendation for vaccinated people, people asked ‚Äúwhat happens if unvaccinated people don‚Äôt wear masks and expose me as a vaccinated person‚Äù. The response at the time was along the lines of ‚Äúthe vaccine is so efficacious you‚Äôll be fine‚Äù. That no longer holds but people still have the expectation of that near sterilizing immunity. We unfortunately changed the pandemic response somewhat in the US to viewing the pandemic as a personal issue instead of a public one, we now need to switch back to viewing it as a public one. The second part of this is that a lot of people who want to cast doubt on the vaccine have thrown out the idea that the vaccine is only useful if it provides sterilizing immunity, which is a bit crazy. It‚Äôs a moving of the goal posts type deal, I personally believe that a lot of people that make that argument don‚Äôt actually believe it and are using it as a straw man. If they were consistent with that argument, they wouldn‚Äôt wear a seat belt for example because you can still get hurt in a car crash if you wear a seat belt, a seat belt won‚Äôt assure that you don‚Äôt get hurt it just minimizes the chances.

I totally agree with you that we need to reframe people‚Äôs expectations on the vaccine. Vaccinations are always most effective on a population level. No matter how much protection a vaccine provides the individual, you are always safer if the pathogen is just not circulating or circulating less and the best way to stop circulation is if as many people as possible are vaccinated.",,,,1629306236,{},h9fft89,False,t3_p6tj22,False,False,t1_h9f4z5d,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p6tj22/vaccines_show_declining_effectiveness_against/h9fft89/,1629371700.0,21,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the vaccines are probably more like 60% effective after \~5 months (and a lot of people got their doses in January-March), two doses simply is not enough to control the Delta alone. And many states are taking actions to prevent other measures from being taken (ie: schools not allowed to require masks). 

The vaccines do seem good at preventing death. Serious disease though? Not sure if that's true long-term.

Fever, loss of taste and cough are the common symptoms that the coronavirus brings with it.

This is confirmed by Michael Baumberger, chief physician at the Paraplegic Center Nottwil LU. Four of them are dealt with there.  
Head physician Xavier Jordan from the Clinique Romand de R√©adaption in Sion VS also treats two paralyzed patients. He says: ¬´After a thorough investigation, all possibilities were ruled out. The paralysis could only be explained by the virus ¬ª. But how is that possible?  
Corona can attack the nervous system  
Baumberger says: ‚ÄúThis can happen because of a circulatory disorder. Another possibility is when the virus affects the central nervous system directly. What exactly is going on is currently still the subject of research. ""  
Those affected have been in treatment for months, says Baumberger. There are patients who will recover and those who will remain paralyzed. It is different from patient to patient.

New Zealand has been widely lauded by organizations such as the WHO for extremely strong capabilities in both contact tracing and case modeling. Their contact tracing includes genetic sequencing that is largely unrivaled, allowing them to understand exactly where and from whom people got sick and see what clusters are and are not connected. They also can predict likely outbreaks down to a specific suburb due to a their modeling capabilities in conjunction with their contact tracing. So to really stick a pin in it, New Zealand is doing incredible work with contact tracing and their success in contact tracing goes well above and beyond the fact that they are a small island nation. The fact that they don‚Äôt have surges is in large part because of this which is why I brought that up. To again be very clear, New Zealand‚Äôs success in contact tracing is attributable to great management by their government and really great usage of technology and they are special in this regard even compared to other islands with small populations.

I don't see any temporary date that the mandates were extended to to look forward to. I don't see any criteria that's been put out there for when the mandates will end. 

It's not so easy for everyone to wear a mask. By extending it without an end you're basically telling an entire group of people, myself included, that they will have to have a reduced quality of life until they die.

I just want someone to confidently tell me that it will end and why. I got my shots. I know that masks work. I know that vaccines work and are as safe as any other vaccine. 

But there are tradeoffs to masking. It does affect childhood development to not see faces. It makes it difficult to recognize people, especially for neurodivergent people. It creates a mindset of fear. It reduces oxygen intake for exercise, particularly intense cardio. It's bad for your skin, so much so that even doctors are recommended to take breaks from wearing a mask by dermatologists. It's bad for your dental hygeine.

As the virus becomes less deadly as more and more people get vaccinated when can masks be optional again? what magic number(s) are we waiting for?

And especially once the CDC mask guidance was changed, many people's fears were assuaged and they thought finally I can go back to living my life freely. Especially with all the touting of the mRNA vaccines being at 92-95% effective. No, people did not think ""oh wait, that doesn't apply to transmission"", they thought I am free, I am safe. I've heard this from several people, some recently.

That it has been proven that this is not the case is an eye-opener and a dose of harsh, harsh reality. And I fully expect many, many people to forgo getting the booster.

Which is why luckily thus far ebola and marburg have been drastically more contained. They are nasty fuckers that kill you quickly, and the faster you‚Äôre catatonic the less spreading you‚Äôll do. 

Viruses tend to more contagious and less deadly due to natural selection - those are the ones that manage to keep going. That doesn‚Äôt mean more deadly variants won‚Äôt show up, but they‚Äôll often ‚Äúburn out‚Äù more quickly. 

How well the virus can evade the mRNA vaccines will depend on how different they are. I won‚Äôt go into super deep genetics here, but different types of mutations can have wildly different effects. A standard insertion or deletion would be a single nucleotide on that strand, or you could have multiple, or a translocation where a whole chunk gets swapped around. But those changes may or may not allow the virus to keep replicating. It could have no effect, have a minor one, or completely change it. Some changes are so drastic that they‚Äôll actually kill that virus line. The same principles apply to any other DNA as well - where a mutation could be transparent, a minor change, a disability, or render the fetus unviable. 

Short answer - the advantage is that the rate of change is currently slower with respect to creation of new variants.

Next, let me put something into perspective for you:

In ww2 we lost aprx 418k Americans. At the time that was 0.32% of the population. Korea was 0.0026% of the population. Vietnam was about the same. If you add all these together and average the population totals you‚Äôd get around 0.31% of the population died during these wars. So in reality Covid is LESS than that. 

And yes it‚Äôs important to contrast this to the leading cause of death in the US. Why? Because that leading cause is likely not going to get better. We lose this number of people annually and we don‚Äôt really think much about it. Covid is a particular focus point, but cases will go down as more people get vaccinated, as more people gain natural immunity, and as better treatments are found. The first two are literally not possible with  heart disease in this country. So acting like a second leading cause will stick around forever is useless when again, all the evidence shows that is likely not the case. 

Sure, the number of cases in kids will continue to rise if we do nothing. And there are things that can and should be done. We know the delta is spreading quickly amongst those with no immunity and children under 12 can‚Äôt get the vaccine so they are particularly targeted. But we also know with the current data available that even with delta children have low mortality rates and the numbers remain MUCH lower than other reasons why children are hospitalized or die. 

The hyperbolic reaction of covid is not supported by the data no matter what anyone thinks. Does that mean nothing should be done? Of course not, prevention is worthwhile.

And personally if you had the option to get vaccinated but refused to then I don't care if the proverbial you dies. We should just leave those idiots in a pile locked in a hermetically sealed room to all infect each other and die. I'm sorry but I can't care more about some stranger than they do.

None of my anger applies to Children who can't get the vaccine or the people who can't get the vaccine for medical reasons. But the number of children who have died from this is less than 1% of the number of people who have died from COVID. For children this is less bad than the flu. For children. I repeat, for CHILDREN. (Bad is in terms of deaths and hospitalizations) 

You say higher vaccination rates, GREAT! what is the rate we are waiting for? that's something at least. I can take current trends and extrapolate to give myself a rough estimate of how long it will take to reach various percentages.

However I do feel Biden made the right decision in May and the wrong decision in July with regards to masks. The vaccines do reduce transmission. We know they do because the minority of COVID infections are breakthrough infections. The delta variant is more transmissible than the alpha variant and the vaccines are less effective at stopping the delta variant transmission than the alpha variant. However the vaccines are not completely ineffective at preventing transmission. I will take the risk and I don't care about those who choose to take an increased risk.

There was so much talk about caring about neurodiversity and fighting ableism before the pandemic but when you are forcing a group of people to be afraid of everyone around them calling the cops on them for pulling their mask down to breath easier and being afraid to step outside for fear of arrest it really shows that all that was just talk.",,,,1629318693,{},h9g7qlg,False,t3_p5uxrj,False,True,t1_h9f625e,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p5uxrj/us_to_advise_boosters_for_most_americans_8_months/h9g7qlg/,1629386916.0,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We get through the day in 3-5 hours depending on what we are doing and they have the entire day to play or create whatever they want.  When their friends get home from school they all come over to our house to play for a little bit but then have to go inside to do homework - and I am wondering why a 4th grader needs to do homework after already being in school for 8 hours!

Incorrect, it was a deliberate lie.

1. It was perpetuated for many months after it was well known what happened in India (where there were many symptomatic breakthroughs already in April).

2. Only AZ actually PCR tested during Phase III and it showed very little protection against infection. The RNA vaccines only really scored on symptoms. That they reduce transmission was inferred from retrospective studies on real life data but it was never close to 100%

3. That antibodies wane fast was already known in March. Pfizer have never been very open about it, but Moderna put out multiple studies very clearly showing it. 

4. There were multiple countries that had their worst waves after they got to high levels of vaccination -- Chile, Bahrain, Seychelles, Maldives, Mongolia, etc. 

So to summarize:

1. It was known the vaccines are not sterilizing from real-life data from first principles (mucosal IgA vs. systemic IgG immunity, the former not being induced by IM injections)

2. By April 2021 the latest it was known that the main difference between vaccine is how high the initial nAb titers are, from then on they decline on the same trajectory

3. By early May 2021 the latest, after the effects of the P681R in the context of B.1.617.2 were understood, and after the situation in India had fully unfolded to biblical disaster proportions, it was known that at some point in the summer, the US would be in the situation it is right now.

Note that this was BEFORE the CDC removed all restriction and LONG BEFORE the current administration declared independence from the virus.

This prompted [the American Academy of Pediatrics to send them a letter telling them they needed to speed things up](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/09/opinion/covid-vaccine-children-fda.html?searchResultPosition=2).

Choice quotes from the article since I know it's behind a paywall:

&gt; ‚ÄúWhat has concerned us is there hasn‚Äôt seemed to be the same level of urgency in authorizing a vaccine for younger kids as there was for adults,‚Äù Dr. Lee Savio Beers, the president of the group, told me. Everyone believes that the F.D.A. should be prudent in evaluating vaccine safety. But at some point, too much institutional risk aversion is a risk itself.

&gt; ‚ÄúOur experts really actually feel very comfortable with the current size of the trial and with a two-month review period,‚Äù said Beers. This makes sense; Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told me he‚Äôs scoured the literature and hasn‚Äôt found any example of a vaccine whose side effects take more than two months to show up.

&gt; The problem is that the F.D.A. won‚Äôt be blamed for avoidable Covid cases the same way it would be blamed for unexpected vaccine side effects. All of its institutional incentives therefore point toward excessive wariness. What the F.D.A. does, said Jha, is ‚Äúmitigate the downside risk of drugs and vaccines. They are almost never asked to consider the downsides of delay.‚Äù Most of the time, he said, ‚Äúthat approach works, except if you‚Äôre in a global pandemic.‚Äù

So make no mistake, the vaccine could have been approved in time for kids to get at least the first shot by the time school started, but wasn't because bureaucrats got some egg on their face.",,,,1629301100,{},h9f45yd,False,t3_p6oszu,False,False,t1_h9f349c,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p6oszu/this_will_be_a_tough_year_thousands_of_kids_are/h9f45yd/,1629365952.0,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,
