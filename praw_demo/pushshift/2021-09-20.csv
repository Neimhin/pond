It's just not fair to them to face more than a couple years in prison or any long term consequences for their actions. 

FWIW I think the reason why people are so okay with the current system is because true crime isn't popular and people don't know how bad it is. Even in the US, criminal reform is almost always driven by public outrage after victims and their families speaking out. That's why a lot of the laws are named after people (Amber alert, Megan's law, Suzanne's law, etc.) If it's taboo for victims to speak out in the first place and no one really cares when they do...

&gt;Natalie Rise was a registered nurse in Idaho who loved her job as a home health care worker before she decided to stay at home with her special-needs twins, according to her brother, Daryl Rise.  
&gt;  
&gt;But her science-based training to become an RN was apparently no match for the disinformation about Covid-19 vaccines being shared across social media, according to her brother.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rise refused to be vaccinated, even as the virus surged in her city, Coeur d'Alene. And even as her mother lay in a coma in a hospital bed, fighting for life against Covid, Natalie advised her family against being vaccinated.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As for the Rise family, Natalie's death has upended the family. Daryl has given up his job as a truck driver to help care for the 10-year-old twins his sister left behind, he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;His and Natalie's mother, who is still recovering from Covid-19, remains on the fence about being vaccinated, he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;But Daryl got his first shot the day after his sister died.  
&gt;  
&gt;**""It was the hardest decision of my life, you know, am I doing right by God? Am I doing right by Natalie?"" he said. ""And I got it out of fear.""**

Although it's true this change has delayed vaccine approval/roll-out for children 5-11, the FDA did the right thing under the circumstances.    

Per The Washington Post:

&gt;Federal regulators have requested that vaccine companies expand their trials to test coronavirus shots in several thousand school-aged children before seeking authorization — a move intended to assess whether a rare inflammation of the heart muscle that has been seen in young adults shortly after vaccination is more common in younger age groups.

&gt;The FDA wants to be particularly careful about the possibility of children developing myocarditis, or heart inflammation, after receiving a coronavirus vaccine. Adolescents who receive the vaccines are more likely to develop myocarditis than adults — though the risk remains small — and **officials want to increase the chances that the trials will indicate whether there is increased incidence of heart inflammation in children.**",,,,1632225398,,{},hdphi1i,False,t3_prsbj3,False,True,t1_hdmg8bq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prsbj3/covid19_vaccine_for_5_to_11yearolds_is_safe_and/hdphi1i/,1632338894.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

Only in 1972 was the first countrywide law put into place. Anyone who owned illegal firearms before could register and keep them.

u/zorinlynx is absolutely correct about the meaning of herd immunity in this context - when enough people have some level of protection via past infection or (ideally) vaccination, the virus is going to struggle to spread efficiently because it'll be hard to find people without some level of immunity. It is this struggle that eventually will end the active part of the pandemic and also protect those groups you mentioned, though I am going to say that I care a LOT more about the protection of the immunocompromised, the young and those legitimately unable to be vaccinated than I do those who aren't vaccinated because they don't want to be.

Future exposures will not remain at the same lethality - for one thing, we already know a lot more about how to treat this than we did a year ago, and I expect that knowledge will only increase with even more time. We have the monoclonal antibody infusion, which seems to be remarkable if given early enough, and more treatments are on the way.

Wow, really? I think they do suck really that badly. They could've prepared for the pandemic, acquiring PPE, 1 to 2 months sooner than they did (it was clear a pandemic was coming by end of January); they even allowed carnaval to go ahead; after which they gave the wrong advice on wearing masks, simply because they were worried there wouldn't be enough masks for the healthcare workers and they continually flip-flopped on taking measures to contain the pandemic.

Pretty fucking horrible response in my opinion.

And if they had been honest about the masks people wouldn't have been so hesitant to wear them and we would've contained it much more than we did. We had awful numbers compared to many other EU countries.

[],,shadowofpurple,,,[],,,,text,t2_7dtkfmwy,False,False,[],"CHEYENNE – Kay Dersham says she no longer wants to put her nursing license or her ethics on the line after the recent decision made by the Laramie County School District 2 Board of Trustees.
The trustees voted unanimously Monday to make quarantining optional for students and faculty exposed to an individual who tested positive with COVID-19. Instead, against state and county health department recommendations, they may attend school for two weeks while wearing a mask with no required test.
Dersham resigned two days after the protocol was passed, and said the school board gave her no other choice.
“I just can’t look the other way anymore,” she said.
She is one of two nurses who serve the rural district and has been a health care provider for 40 years in Laramie County. In the early 1980s, she was the first school nurse to work in LCSD2, and helped build the program from the ground up. She also spent 25 years at the Cheyenne-Laramie County Health Department before returning to nursing.
She said she became a school nurse because it was as if she was serving her own family. She never thought she would have to walk away from the children and staff she loves.
But in all of those years providing care, she said this was the first time an employer asked her to do something that could potentially affect her license or was unethical.
“They’re just putting school nurses in such bad situations,” she said, “and no one will step up.”
In her letter of resignation to LCSD2 Superintendent Justin Pierantoni and the board members, she referred to the expectations set for her in her job description, as well as from federal, state and county health agencies.
She wrote, “I do not believe the school nurses are being treated like health professionals who have the education and background in communicable diseases, and who understand the implications of the pandemic. In my opinion, the COVID situation has become political, with poor decisions that adversely affect the health of my students and the role of a school nurse.”
She said she was asked to turn the other way when students and staff didn’t wear masks on the buses, which is federal law and was even required in LCSD1 before the Cheyenne district passed its overarching mask mandate.
The Wyoming State Board of Nursing administrative rules also state that a registered nurse is to “take preventative measures to protect the client, others and self.” It specifies promoting a safe and therapeutic environment by identifying unsafe care situations. Dersham said she is no longer adhering to those expectations, either.
In the grounds for discipline, it states her license can be removed due to performing unsafe care, which she said she was asked to do. She said this specifically relates to being asked not to follow the Wyoming Department of Health and county health recommendations regarding COVID-19 quarantining.
Kim Deti, a spokesperson for the state health department, confirmed the new protocol taken up by LCSD2 was inconsistent with current recommend-ations and guidelines.
The rules were made clear, she said.
“You isolate when you have been infected with the virus, even when you don’t have symptoms,” Deti said. “You quarantine when you might have been exposed to the virus, even when you don’t have symptoms.”
Kathy Emmons, director of the Cheyenne-Laramie County Health Department, also agreed with Dersham. She said Dersham was a phenomenal nurse, and she was going to miss the opportunity to work with her, but she had been put in a difficult situation.
Emmons said she is another casualty of the pandemic.
It was difficult for Dersham not only to ignore guidelines and rules set for her, but as one of two nurses in the district, she said she was also overwhelmed.
She understood why masking was a choice for parents, but said she disagreed because there were consequences associated with that freedom.
COVID cases and quarantines rising throughout the school district were impacting her ability to do her job. She said almost all of her time was dedicated to contact tracing and other COVID-19 responsibilities.
Even on weekends, Dersham and the other nurse were required to come in and filter through the recent COVID cases. She said over Labor Day weekend, there were no breaks, and call after call came in to add another student or faculty member who tested positive to the stack for tracing.
Although she was dedicated to helping provide this service to the school, she said it started to feel as though she was putting the other students’ safety in jeopardy.
With all of her time being dedicated to COVID, she didn’t have the opportunity to thoroughly address students, some of whom are diabetics or have seizures. She began having to train other employees in emergency care, just in case she was not able to respond.
“We don’t just put Band-Aids on,” she said. “There’s so much that goes into school nursing.”
Dersham said she didn’t want to completely abandon the students, though, and will work until Sept. 30. She is creating a transition plan and is continuing to get immunizations records, screenings and other necessary tasks done.
She said it was not her intention to put the district in a bind, or make the students suffer, she just doesn’t feel she is providing proper care anymore.
Dersham said she knows many nurses across the state who also feel this way, as school boards are making decisions with no medical background. She believes this could happen anywhere.
“This is not even about District No. 2,” she said, “this is statewide. We can’t have school boards making motions that go against county and state orders, or recommendations.”",,,,1632251552,,{},hdr4v4p,False,t3_ps4bpl,False,True,t1_hdnfmf9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ps4bpl/lcsd2_nurse_resigns_im_being_asked_not_to_follow/hdr4v4p/,1632381796.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

Why? Other diseases like polio or measles have been worldwide before being completely eradicated by vaccines. why should covid19's escape from wuhan rule out the same result by vaccine?

&gt;and that's what every expert has been saying since early 2020

well yes in early 2020 many experts thought it might be years before we saw a vaccine, if ever. but then in late 2020/early 2021, the vaccine was announced faster than was expected, and initial reports showed it very effective. media reports definitely talked about herd immunity being the goal, at least as I recall. I don't have those sources in front of me.

&gt;Vaccines can still be very helpful to reduce spread. And an endemic virus with a steady state of millions of cases per day is very different from an endemic virus with thousands of cases per day, and more vaccinations (and other mitigations during outbreaks) can push the case numbers down

&gt;Based on the number of breakthrough hospitalizations (hospitalizations among those who are fully vaccinated with a COVID-19 diagnosis) reported to the CDC, we estimate that 98.6% of people hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis between June and August 2021 were unvaccinated.

&gt;Based on a recent CDC study of 13 jurisdictions, we used a conservative estimate of 86% of COVID-19 hospitalizations were unvaccinated people.

The Kaiser Family Foundation report is good. Yahoo's summary is quite poor.

HELENA, Mont. (AP) — The public health officer in a politically conservative county in northwestern Montana has resigned his post to ease what his resignation letter called “the strife and conflict coming from a minority of people objecting” to his recommendations in responding to the coronavirus.

A member of the public blamed the health officer for his wife’s recent death due to COVID-19.

Nick Lawyer, a physician’s assistant at the hospital in Plains, said he submitted his letter of resignation on Friday at the request of Sanders County Commissioners. He released a copy of the letter on social media. Two commissioners said he offered to resign and they accepted it.
His resignation came two days after Gerald “Frenchy” Cuvillier called Lawyer a “petty tyrant,” during a meeting of the county commissioners and said Lawyer’s “rules of protocol just cost my wife her life.”

Cuvillier complained his wife was not given the anti-parasitic medication ivermectin, or the malaria treatment hydroxychloroquine and wasn’t treated with monoclonal antibodies. If she had, “she would be alive and well today,” Cuvillier said.

“I had to watch her die slowly and in agony,” he said.

When he finished, Cuvillier threw his letter on the floor and walked out, Commissioner Anthony Cox said Monday.",,,,1632260082,,{},hdrpb0b,True,t3_pssoo0,False,False,t3_pssoo0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pssoo0/man_blames_county_health_officer_for_his_wifes/hdrpb0b/,1632392927.0,18,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;The simplest calculation also relies on a major assumption: that being vaccinated confers perfect protection, meaning zero chance of getting infected and transmitting the virus, Lipsitch says. If this were true, then vaccinating 67% of the population would cut about two-thirds of transmission, meaning the typical infection would jump to one other person instead of three.

This model may apply to smallpox and polio, but is obviously ruled out for covid, which leads me to conclude no chance of herd immunity, which is the nexus of my question.

Like if you really wanted to know you'd get 10,000 people who were vaccinated 6 months ago and the same number freshly vaccinated, adjust for age and other conditions, and expose and/or track them.

But this isn't really practical because every society has a mix of unvaccinated and vaccinated at different times. So instead you track how often people get the virus and how sick they get and sort them by vaccination status.

But when you do this there are other variables, like 6 months ago the delta variant wasn't dominant, and many areas were still under at least partial lockdown. A full summer of no restrictions plus the delta variant meant a huge increase in cases and transmission.

So how much of the increase was due to delta and behavior and how much was due to vaccine protection ""waning""? It really is not obvious from the data.

So some places just assume the worst and assume the vaccine protection is waning. But that isn't really proven. There is evidence that ""antibodies decline"", but also a theory that there are two kinds of antibodies, the initial ones and later, stronger ones, and that vaccine protection [actually increases after 6 months](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/08/30/1032520934/immunity-to-covid-19-could-last-longer-than-youd-think).",,,,1632259763,,{},hdrokl1,False,t3_psdjg3,False,True,t1_hdr94ta,/r/Coronavirus/comments/psdjg3/daily_discussion_thread_september_21_2021/hdrokl1/,1632392508.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

Kids are at extremely low risk for getting sick or dying like literally 1 in a million. But the elderly with health conditions are at very high risk, and even if they are vaccinated, they're at considerable risk, like 1000's of times more.

So if you go through schools today and test you'll probably find a lot of cases but statistically almost none of them will get seriously ill whether they are vaccinated or not.

If you go through a nursing home and test and anyone is positive there is a pretty high chance that they won't make it.

This is similar to how the CDC coordinates studies by collecting and reporting seroprevalence data from hundreds of labs around the country.

Some of these side effects are probably a little bit underreported but not significant. Even with some cases at every hospital it would still a tiny tiny fraction of the millions vaccinated.

About 1% have short term adverse effects (headaches and nausea, mostly), though serious (life threatening) adverse effects are extremely rare.

The main issue with veterinary (horse paste) ivermectin isn't other ingredients (mostly inert gel), its that dosing is difficult. A typical tube has enough ivermectin to treat worms in a 1250 lb horse. To adjust that to get the doses used in trials (200-400 mcg/kg) requires knowing the dosing, the patient's weight, the total amount in a tube, doing some math, and carefully cutting off a small amount (less than a cm for children). It's easy to understand why some are ending up in hospitals: they weren't aware of expected adverse effects, and they aren't capable of correct dosing. Some parents trying this are giving children several times the dose used clinically (in either river blindness campaigns, or experimentally in antiviral trials), and their children are paying the price.

If there's ever a consensus that ivermectin has clinically useful antiviral effect at safe dosing, the human drug (3 mg tablets in the US and most countries) + clear instructions on dosing and possible side effects, would avoid these risks of overdosing.",,,,1632198324,,{},hdojv44,False,t3_ps6vlu,False,False,t1_hdo7gl7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ps6vlu/ivermectin_two_other_drugs_being_tested_in_musc/hdojv44/,1632317708.0,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,people40,,,[],,,,text,t2_57f9c,False,False,[],"I agree with you that masks wouldn't make much difference in this case because they would likely be unmasked to eat/drink for the majority of their time at the restaurant. However, you're misinterpreting that study. It does not imply a personal risk reduction of 11.2% (i.e., if you wear a mask during a given interaction you are 11.2% less likely to get COVID vs. if you don't wear one). 

The 11.2% is a reduction in number of cases between treatment and control \*villages\*, and the mask-encouraged villages had 42% observed masking in public vs. 13% in the control villages. So the study says 29% more masking across a village leads to 11% less COVID villagewide. If transmissions in public settings are relatively rare compared to transmissions in private settings, these results could be consistent with masks being 100% protective for the wearer. Alternatively, if the benefits of masking come from preventing the wearer from spreading to others rather than protecting the wearer from catching it, the results could be consistent with masks being 0% protective for the wearer. 

We simply don't know based on the study because it was not designed to detect effects on the individual level. But it is fair to assume that the effect for an individual is substantially greater than 11%, because that 11% benefit came from only 29% more people wearing masks. Furthermore, many COVID transmissions occur in private (within households) where people are almost certainly unmasked, which negatively biases the observed effect of masking.",,,,1632198234,,{},hdojps7,False,t3_prxrvj,False,True,t1_hdmwo8l,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prxrvj/texas_restaurant_owner_threw_out_a_family_wearing/hdojps7/,1632317622.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

I was never saying the parents are making the best decision ever, but I’m not going to jump on them for making that decision. They clearly care about their kids health, but it didn’t fall under enough safety guidelines to mitigate risk, etc. It’s a good point that you can’t take real good precautions dining inside unmasked to eat, etc, (although again, six foot distanced, masked when seating, and being vaccinated would minimize risk dramatically, and to your point, still not worth the risk for a compromised baby) so they would have been better off doing takeout or outdoor seating. Their media bubble likely isn’t doing them any favors since they’re in Texas, so they likely aren’t as informed as you about the actual risk factors, and are clearly trying their best by wearing masks in an area where people are regularly shunned, kicked out of places, and attacked for wearing them. They’re also four months in and learning about their new responsibilities that they likely hadn’t anticipated, they’re probably very stressed and trying to adapt to a lot. Maybe this whole experience will encourage them to not go out as much, which would keep their baby safer. I’m sure if you had a sit down with them and shared your knowledge, they wouldn’t have made that choice to go out (swinging back to the restaurant owner in the middle of this story being the actual villain…).

It seems like the perp acted out of emotion and this, by definition, cannot be upgraded to murder. This means he'll get a maximum of 15 years but realistically closer to 10. 

Fun fact: If you abuse your spouse until they die, it's manslaughter. If you kill your abusive spouse because they'd murder you if you tried to leave, this situation is by definition murder and comes with a mandatory life sentence. Killing your spouse because you don't want to get a divorce is also generally considered manslaughter and I don't understand why people go through the process of normal divorce when you can just off your spouse, spend \~10 years in prison, and then keep all the assets.

I have yet to teste positive for COVID but right about late May/early June I and 4 friends (all double Pfizer'd) traveled to Los Angeles for a short but responsible vacation. Couple of days. Right around that time, I can't recall before or after, I started dealing with a really nasty taste and smell - both the same - that was very prevalent in a lot of food. My general sense of smell was that nasty aroma and most, not all but most, of the food I consumed was also that aroma.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not know if I've had COVID or not but why else I'd be having these issues I dont know. I saw a doctor for a separate health issue recently and got an MRI and CT scan on my head and there was nothing wrong.

I see pros and cons with everything during this pandemic, and I do what I know I need to, to protect myself the best way I can. I do some risky things, but not to the extent some people are doing. I walk outside barefoot and eat herbs or veggies from the ground. I take supplements and eat healthy and organic most the time, i splurge once a week on dessert lol, and I don’t wear masks unless going to a doctors office, or places like that. The more we are exposed and build antibodies things should get better. 

And this was the third wave, and should be the last. It will probably disappear or get weaker, as more people with natural antibodies, and 💉 with natural antibodies, it should slow the spread down to nothing. If this is like previous viruses. If it isn’t then we have a new norm and they will need to find a better 💉 or medication to protect ppl before they get to the hospital. Like tamaflu but for this one. Because otherwise we have to accept ppl will die, 💉 or not because that is what will happen. Less will be dying as most will be 💉 but then the majority will eventually be 💉 by then as the rest will slowly die or build immunity. But that will be the sad reality if this virus differs from previous pandemics or even sars. 

I just don’t think most want to admit it. This is going to go one of a few ways, and admitting that it is never going to be the same again, is a lot for people to admit. And mental health is a big issue in this country, the pandemic created fear, which created depression and triggered ppls flight or fight response and now what we r seeing is just that. And they r going thru grief. The “5 stages” of grief, as if one could so easily say there r only 5 stages lol, but thats another topic for another day; denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Same thing we r witnessing now. Hopefully the acceptance thing comes, but the sad reality is we need to learn to stop hating each other so much over their choices, and do what is best for u and ur loved ones! Stop worrying what others are doing or not doing, and focus on protecting u. Life sucks for ppl like me, before the pandemic we had to do this during flu season, and now, all year. The sooner parents and kids accept that, the better life will be. Just wish more would figure this out. I don’t know why so many hate strangers and call them all names when the reality is ur bullying one another, and they could be doing whatever they can to protect themselves, meanwhile they group everyone into the category. 🤦‍♀️

At this point we assume that Covid is going to be endemic and everyone will get it sooner or later, and it's better to be vaccine protected when you get it. 

Covid myocarditis: ""For the 12-17-year-old male cohort, 6/6,846 (0.09%) patients developed myocarditis overall, with an adjusted rate per million of 876 cases (Wilson score interval 402 - 1,911).

So the risks of getting vaccine myocarditis is 37 - 263 out of a million, while getting Covid myocarditis is 561 out of a million for your age group.

We had our first case 18 months ago, but promptly closed our borders, letting people come in only with a first PCR test before boarding, then a 2 weeks quarantine at a local hotel, then another PCR test before leaving the hotel. And you can't get yourself a ticket to New Caledonia, you have to make a request to the government, so tourism is extremely limited (mostly relatives of people living in New Cal).

In 18 months, except for 2 lockdown, a 4 weeks, and a 3 weeks one about 1 year appart, it was business as usual, and we kept the 'covid free' status.

Then we started getting Pfizer vaccines, but people didn't really rushed in... a bit because of misinformations on social media, but also because people didn't see the point since we had the luxury to be covid free.

Then we got multiple breakthrough at once, on different locations, from people unrelated to each other. 1 month later and it's total chaos in our Health Care system, people were only vaccinated to 20% (we are now approaching 30%), and a big portion of the population suffers from obesity and diabetes. We were supposed to have only 30 IC beds for 300 000 people, we are now at almost 60 IC beds, only 1 month after the first case, and it will not stretch forever.

I got lucky and left the country 2 months for Europe with my partner in order to visit family members who suffered from isolation, we are now witnessing this disaster from far away.

We also get to watch a daily live video of the government on facebook, while having an absurd number of antivax, and all around stupid comments at the same time, it's surreal.

You may have picked up on some hesitancy in my post where I said ""assuming the research proves it to be safe and beneficial"".  I'm already thinking of some of the things that you're pointing out.  I'll be looking at data trying to determine the risk of not being vaccinate vs. being vaccinated.  One thing to keep in mind is that death is **not** the only negative outcome for people, kids included.

As to point number 2, the vaccine lowers the chance to catch and spread the disease.  It's just like how people still die in car accidents wearing seatbelts, but we still wear them because it improves our chances to have the positive outcome.  According to the CDC vaccinated folks are less likely to spread the virus than unvaccinated.

However, if the research shows limited benefits to children and even come risks, should I subject my kids to risk to reduce the spread of COVID to the unvaccinated adults that put their faith in Jesus and ignore medical science until their reading to take up a hospital bed so that medical science can try to save their life?

It was directly related to Germany's past. During the drafting process of the German constitution in 1949, a large majority of representatives agreed on including the sentence ""The death penalty has been abolished."" The parties on the left were in favor of abolishing the death penalty on ethical reasons and specifically due to the injustices carried out under the Nazi regime. The center right (CDU) was officially in favor of the death penalty but about half of them ended up voting to abolish it. The far right was opposed to the death penalty because they wanted executions of former Nazis to cease.

There is absolutely no way to disconnect the decision of putting that sentence in our constitution from the experience under Nazi rule.

&gt;it's to do with being a baseline civilized country.

Spain abolished the death penalty in 1978, France in 1981, and the UK in 1965 for capital crimes and 1998 for treason. There wasn't a clear consensus between Western countries to abolish the death penalty after WWII. In Germany and Austria (1950), it was a direct result of both countries' experienced under Nazi rule.

To go full circle and come back around to the US, I'll leave you with the following fact.

&gt;Dr Nicole Linder’s voice breaks as she tells the story of Kathy, a “vivacious and gregarious” patient who had to be sent home to die of Covid-19 because she refused to be vaccinated against it.

&gt;Kathy is one of millions of Americans who have decided, for an array of very different reasons, not to get the coronavirus vaccine. Linder, chief hospitalist at OSF Healthcare St Francis Hospital in Michigan’s remote Upper Peninsula, expressed her pain and frustration at the death toll when I spoke to her: “This time is much more challenging for me than the last go round. The suffering just seems so unnecessary. It’s like patients are tied to a train track and you can see the train coming and they can see it coming and . . . it just rolls over them. And all this could have been avoided.”

&gt;Some healthcare workers say they are struggling to cope with feelings of resentment and blame against unvaccinated patients who are driving the latest surge of Covid-19 in the US. 

&gt;President Joe Biden became the voice of national impatience over the issue when he demanded earlier this month that big US companies force their employees to be vaccinated, or submit to weekly Covid-19 testing. Only 65.2 per cent of US adults are fully vaccinated.

&gt;Hospital workers pay a high price for the unvaccinated. Some resent risking their lives, and putting relatives at risk, to care for those whose personal choices made them ill. “People who have liver disease from alcoholism or lung disease from smoking, the consequences of their choices really only impact them”, says Jeanne Wirpsa, medical ethicist at Chicago’s Northwestern Memorial Hospital. She adds that the choice to refuse a vaccine impacts healthcare workers in a much more direct way.

&gt;“They feel like, ‘there was something you could have done, why didn’t you do it? You say you don’t believe in science and vaccines but then you want us to fix it, but if you don’t believe in science what are you doing here?’”

&gt;Healthcare workers saw light at the end of the pandemic tunnel after vaccines were introduced, so it’s even more painful to see it being extinguished now, Wirpsa says. “It runs through people’s minds, understandably, that ‘you made your bed now lie in it’.”

&gt;But ethicists like Wirpsa are clear that all sufferers must be treated equally. “We give the same care to the guy who shot the five-year-old as to the five-year-old,” she stresses. And she cautions against lumping together all vaccine refusers since their motivations — and their politics — are very diverse.

&gt;“Not all the unvaccinated are aggressive, violent anti-vaxxers that spit in your face,” says Nina Redl, chaplain at Bryan Medical Centre in Lincoln, Nebraska. Redl has been ministering to Covid patients since the pandemic began. “They say, ‘I normally trust my pastor, my friends, they said it wasn’t a great idea . . . and I looked at the internet, there were 500 different opinions, I just didn’t know whom to trust. I was scared and I shut down’.” Redl runs support sessions for staff who are frustrated at vaccine resistance, to help them over their compassion fatigue. 

&gt;Some healthcare workers have themselves refused the Covid vaccine, and Redl notes that the reasons behind their resistance are often as complicated as those of unvaccinated patients. Simply condemning them does not help, she says.

&gt;Recommended

&gt;Both Redl and Wirpsa say that giving vaccinated patients priority over unvaccinated patients is an ethical non-starter. “People have a right to make their own very unhealthy decisions . . . that doesn’t mean we can’t treat them,” says Redl.

&gt;Treating vaccine resisters “affects us in a very different way than somebody dying because they smoke too much”, she says. She notes that after 18 months on mandatory overtime, the new wave of Covid has been the last straw for some staff. Many have quit, exacerbating an already severe shortage of healthcare workers. 

&gt;Linder says she is “sick and tired” of all the needless pain, but she’s not angry. “You can’t watch people suffer like that and be mad at them”. But such heroics of compassion take their toll on medical staff. We have asked the impossible of them for long enough.",,,,1632229547,,{},hdpov3b,False,t3_ps147x,False,False,t3_ps147x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ps147x/wave_of_avoidable_antivax_covid_deaths_takes_its/hdpov3b/,1632350999.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the start of the COVID-19 immunization program in Ontario, there have been 314 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis following receipt of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in Ontario. Of those, 204 reports of myocarditis/pericarditis met the Brighton Collaboration case definition levels of diagnostic certainty 1, 2 or 3 for myocarditis or pericarditis and are subsequently included in the remainder of the analysis.5,6  
  
Among the 204 reports, 79.9% occurred in males and 69.6% occurred following second dose.  
  
The reporting rate of myocarditis/pericarditis was higher following the second dose of mRNA vaccine than after the first dose, particularly for those receiving the Moderna vaccine as the second dose of the series (regardless of the product received for the first dose).  
  
The reporting rate for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 6.4 per million doses administered following first dose and 8.7 per million doses administered following second dose, for all age groups and genders combined.  
  
The reporting rate for the Moderna vaccine was 6.6 per million doses administered following first dose and 28.2 per million doses administered following second dose, for all age groups and genders combined.  
  
The highest reporting rate of myocarditis/pericarditis was observed in males aged 18-24 years following second dose. The reporting rate in this group following the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as second dose was 37.4 per million doses and was 263.2 per million following the Moderna vaccine as second dose.  
  
Similar patterns in reporting rates were observed when the analysis was restricted to individuals who received their first dose on or after June 1st, 2021, to account for enhanced awareness and surveillance of myocarditis/pericarditis that began in June and a number of other programmatic factors that occurred at that time.  
  
Myocarditis/pericarditis following COVID-19 mRNA vaccines remains a rare AEFI (defined by the Canadian Immunization Guide as occurring at frequency of 0.01% to less than 0.1%), even among the age groups where the highest rates of this event have been observed.

[],,prolixia,,,[],,,,text,t2_4gv9cfqt,False,False,,"I hate the term ""Freedom Day"" - it's something you only hear from the sort of people who make a point of not wearing masks, and the sort of press that panders to them.

However, yes - there are effectively no day-to-day restrictions at the moment for people within the UK, and that includes no mask mandate.

There was supposed to be a ""Vaccine Passport"" (I think it's now called a ""Covid Pass"") that you would need to show for things like nightclubs and events.  However, that wasn't ready to go when they lifted the restrictions and shortly before it was due to be implemented it was placed ""on hold"".  I think it still exists for international travel, but not having any plans to travel abroad the UK, I haven't' checked.

There was the sort of minor anti-vax resistance to the passport that you might expect, but the real problem was that places like bars and clubs weren't prepared to take responsibility for enforcing it.  Having a little experience in that general scene, I've got a lot of sympathy for that - it's like expecting shop workers to enforce the (previous) mask mandates.

There's still a degree of change in terms of how venues are set up - e.g. tables are still spaced apart in many restaurants, there's a lot more outdoor dining, etc.  However, I don't think that's mandated any more and yes - you can party like it's 2019 if you so wish.

As for the mask adoption rate, it's very mixed and depends a huge amount on the type of people present (most especially their age).  Massively generalising here, but the people who wear masks are predominantly the educated, the elderly, and the infirm.  In some shops everyone wears masks and in others no one does.  For example, I live near two large food shops: Marks &amp; Spencers (upmarket, a bit posh, and a favourite of well-off retirees) and Lidl (super-cheap own brands, with young working-class families being typical customers): Maybe 90% of people in M&amp;S are wearing masks, and maybe 10% in Lidl.

My wife works in our local hospital.  *All* the patients in their intensive care with Covid recently have been unvaccinated - there have been vaccinated Covid patients, but they are nothing like as seriously ill.  There is a lot of regret from unvaccinated patients before they die.   Some of the stories are very sad indeed.

When you look at the UK numbers, infections are high but deaths are low - and *very* low compared to the death rate from similar previous infection levels.

Testing is very prevalent - lateral flow tests are available free from pharmacies, libraries, etc. (you literally just walk in and say ""A pack of Covid tests please"").  Last school year there was an expectation that all parents and older children would test a couple of times a week.  However, now amongst a lot of people there's a feeling that once you're vaccinated then you don't need to test any more or take precautions (my optician told me, recently, before getting right in my fact to check my eyes ""We're both vaccinated, so let's take out masks off"").  So I'm not sure it's quite so widespread as it was before everywhere opened up.

However, a lot of people *are* testing all the time - it's an expectation in a lot of businesses that their staff are constantly testing, and the first thing that many will tell you (I had some builders round yesterday and the first thing they said was ""Do you want us to wear a mask in the house?  All out staff test every couple of days.""

I hope that's some context.

If we really wanted to know, we would probably have to do a random sampling of antibody tests, but that's not really feasible as asking random people for blood samples is unlikely to go over well.

3.  our bodies are not designed to keep antibody levels so high for so long.  That's why we have t cells, etc to re produce them as needed.

5. The 2 shot regiments currently in place are still 90 plus percent effective at what they were designed to do, even With Delta accounted for.

In phase 1 studies though this isn't an issue.  [Here's](https://investors.modernatx.com/static-files/c43de312-8273-4394-9a58-a7fc7d5ed098) moderna's data from a month ago.  On slide 30 you see antibody titers declining by a factor of 4-6.  We know that antibody titers are [highly predictive](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01377-8) of efficacy against infection, so this essentially proves there will be some decline in efficacy.

Now, I know you didn't mention booster shots at all, but  only time anyone talks about waning is in the context of boosters so let's go there.  And the data is equally clear that boosters are good whether or not there's any waning. The same moderna data can drop the waning measurement entirely and the data is still tremendously in favor of a 3-dose regimen.  The third dose (highly delayed at 6-8 months, but it's possible an even longer delay would be better) improves neutralization of wildtype 4-fold, gamma 6-fold, and beta 10-fold over the second-dose numbers.  We have no second-dose numbers of Delta, of course, so you do need the before-third-dose data there: neutralization of Delta is increased 42-fold, and is brought up higher than the level of neutralization that gave us 95% efficacy against wildtype after dose 2.  Being at 95% efficacy against Delta would end the Delta pandemic, just as the Alpha and wildtype pandemics ended months ago, regardless of whether the current efficacy is 70% or 88%.

The only arguments against this data at all is that it's too small a sample size.  These trials are being repeated at a larger scale, and if they give the same results we will then know that a third dose is going to tremendously increase protection against infection (and therefore both sterilizing and protective immunity).",,,,1632255356,,{},hdre5pb,False,t3_psdjg3,False,True,t1_hdr94ta,/r/Coronavirus/comments/psdjg3/daily_discussion_thread_september_21_2021/hdre5pb/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,883aa4207306f5910bfaee125e47df7518c2b207,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1632255368.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,True

[],,WackyBeachJustice,,,[],,,,text,t2_rhdlxun,False,False,[],"I don't think anyone with half a brain is questioning that part.  The questioning is in the attempt to parse the ""information"" fed to us by both the WHO and the administration.  Someone is feeding us bullshit, but it's hard to tell who.  The WHO is pounding the table that every single shot should be going abroad.  The US administration says we can do both.  The US already leads the world in vaccine donations, and Biden promised another 500 million by mind next year (200 million by year end).  Scott G mentioned that the US will always stockpile a bunch of vaccine as part of a ""oh shit"" scenario, in case something unforeseen happens.  Anecdotally there are shots expiring away everywhere in the US.  Plenty of information on why it's not possible to ship every single unused shot overseas, due to the logistics involved.  So the reality is quite possible that if boosters aren't approved because of WHO pressure, it wouldn't even change how much vaccine we're actually able to transport to the developing world.  However it would achieve a moral ""equity"".  In other words ""If they can't have it, then you can't have it"".  How many boosters are we even talking about?  There are 181 million fully vaccinated in the US, realistically only a fraction would even want a booster.  So we're maybe talking 100 million shots?  During the spring we were easily oversupplying for a 4 million shots per day vaccination pace.  This basically puts us at 25 days worth of manufacturing capacity to fulfill all the boosters we'd ever need.  And that's assuming our capacity hasn't increased over the last 6 months.

Ultimately there is just no way to know the real truths on all these fronts.  My personal opinion is that Biden is right, and ultimately boosters wouldn't change at all the amount of vaccine the US transports.  It's too small of a number to make a difference, in a process that isn't able to transport internationally every single shot anyway.",,,,1632258521,,{},hdrlp70,True,t3_psr2r0,False,False,t1_hdrjme5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/psr2r0/who_reiterates_warning_against_covid_boosters_for/hdrlp70/,1632390919.0,17,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

As for why new strains could be vaccine resistant, involves the spike protein it uses to bind to our cells. The mRNA vaccines taught our bodies how to recognize and defend against the spike proteins. If the way COVID invades our cells changes, the protection of the vaccine would need to change to teach our bodies the new spike proteins too.

[],,Mr-Hadoken,,,[],,,,text,t2_180rf2sc,False,False,,"I'm just curious why you want kids to get it? Here in the UK we've had sone of the highest numbers in the world. We have at the moment 33,000 cases a DAY in a population of 70 million and since march 2020 we have had close to 15 deaths for people under the age of 16 with no major health conditions. That is also the age group with the most cases by far from the start. (0-16 has over 400,000 recorded cases)

Now this is the important part. In 2016-2017 there were 20 deaths in 12 months (not 18 months) from the flu from ages 5-14 in the UK. I'll bet my life's savings you never got the flu vaccinen for your kids that year right?  It's been around about 20 deaths every year for that age group for the flu. All of this data is accessible on .gov stats. It sends you an excel sheet. 

So everyone that is all of a sudden rushing out to get this covid vaccine for their kids don't realise their kids have a higher chance of dying from the flu but don't vaccinate their kids against that. 

To your point number 2) You can still get the virus and still spread it whilst vaccinated just as easy, what difference would it make to giving the vaccine to kids? Unless of course they were extremely vulnerable. No vaccine is 100% safe so you probably have a higher chance of that age group having problems from the vaccine than covid. Is it worth the risk?

Covid is endemic - it is with us forever, like influenza. We aren't going to eradicate it; the goal is (and has been for some time) to relieve enough pressure on our emergency healthcare system that life can go back to normal without hospitals falling back on triage to manage patient loads.

Vaccinated people are less likely to contract Covid, and are less likely to have severe breakthrough cases on top of that. So while we won't reach herd immunity to the point of eradication, we should reach a point where the hospital system isn't under heavy strain, and where asymptomatic/mild cases function like boosters - the same way that getting the flu in flu season builds our immune system's response to other flu viruses.

[],,pinewind108,,,[],,,,text,t2_1mtphazn,False,False,,"Okay, there are some problems with what you said. People really want vaccines, but the government hasn't exactly been distinguishing themselves when it comes to vaccines.

 First, AZ: The Korean government had the option to buy the entire production of SK Bio's AZ facility. But they refused. SK Bio then sold their production to the Covax program, though the founder did require that a certain percentage (10 or 15%, irrc) remain in Korea for domestic use. 

When the Korean government finally decided they needed some vaccines (around December 2020) they couldn't buy SK Bio's production, and instead bought AZ from India. That was working okay, until India got so devastated they banned exports. So that delayed the AZ, but there were some poor decisions by the Korean government at the start.

Moderna: The Korean government apparently has a ""Last-in-line"" contract with Moderna. No delivery dates are specified. At all. The only deadline is ""sometime before December 31, 2020."" Korea got one of the worst level contracts because they were trying to be cheap, or because they were so late in trying to order vaccines. (Or maybe both.)

Pfizer: They've been making regular deliveries, and keeping to the schedule, so that contract may be more specific, or they are better about keeping the dates they say they will deliver on. 

Still the Korean government didn't have a (big?) contract with them until the day before Pfizer announced a contract to produce billions of vaccines for the EU. It smells like the government here dithered until Pfizer basically told them, ""Decide now. Do you want to be in line ahead of this EU contract, or behind it?""",,,,1632202449,,{},hdoq3cq,False,t3_prlq9n,False,False,t1_hdm03t7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prlq9n/s_korea_new_cases_slightly_over_1600_concerns/hdoq3cq/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,82828dc4ab821ba2ad28295d7b687bdf88af71d4,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1632202463.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Vaccinated people still have other medical emergencies. They are routinely failing to get timely emergency medical care, because of how overhwelmed the hospitals are with covid cases among the unvaccinated.

Vaccinated kids ---&gt; less covid circulating ---&gt; fewer unvaccinated people clogging up ICU beds. 

&gt;Coupled with the fact that numerous scientists and medical professionals are censored at the first instance of trying to discuss actual data that goes against the narrative that “vaccines are safe for everyone”

Because there isn't ""actual data"" supporting the idea that vaccines are dangerous (i.e. more dangerous than the viruses they protect people from).

&gt;where even the flu shot does not have such universal blessing and applicability to a general population

The flu shot has the same kind of blessing that the covid vaccine does. The flu shot is unecessary for the general population for the exact same reason that the scientific community is shooting down the idea of covid boosters for the general population - _if a virus doesn't present a meaningful risk of severe illness, then a vaccine is simply inefficient, and offers a miniscule increase in risk for an even more minescule chance of reward_. Flu shots are encouraged for people at high-risk for severe illness; covid vaccinations are encouraged for everyone because everyone is at a high-enough risk for severe illness that a vaccine mitigates risk rather than increases it.

&gt;But if we can’t even have open discussions as to the many contradictions regarding why the narrative of “what is safe” keeps changing

At a certain point, the logic does flip though.

While not the most scientific measurement, when my local county (population around 200,000) reported new daily cases in the single digits, we viewed things as fairly low risk.  With the delta surge, and new daily cases 100+ most days, we are limiting our activities as much as practical and using N95s when being indoors with other people outside our household can't be avoided.  It's not perfect, but it's seemed to work Ok so far.

The end to all this will come when cases drift back down, and they will.  More people are (slowly) getting vaccinated, others are getting infected and build some immunity that way, others who were infected are getting vaccinated and gaining even more immunity, and in the coming months more people who were vaccinated will also be getting boosters.

So many people never cared, and the government phase of pretending to care is long over. The virus will be endemic until 80-90% of people get the vaccine, and because that isn't going to happen unless the government forces people to get vaccinated we will never see an end to covid.

It will be another flu. A virus that sweeps through every year, but unfortunately kills 10 times as many people.

Because the government failed to eliminate it, and then fucked up every chance since then to contain it. And now it's a partisan political issue so you're never going to get half the people to budge at all on the question. And businesses want a return to normalcy so they can make money, and we know that the government only cares what the wealthy want. 

I live in NH. We hit a 56% rate of first dose recipients in late May. We are now at... 58.7%. Fully vaccinated hit 52% in late June (one month after that late May number) and is currently sitting at 53.5%. Despite Delta.

It just did not move. And it won't move unless we force people to get vaccinated. But *we* can't do that. The government has to. And the government won't. So it is a very difficult situation where the choice is either disconnect from the world entirely forever, or become part of the problem.

We have been abandoned in this. And it's impossible to fight as individuals. We now have to calculate the health risk of being socially disconnected and physically inactive for years. Both of which reduce lifespan and increase chronic and degenerative disease risks. 

At 18 months into this thing the advice cannot continue to be ""stay at home indefinitely."" Because that is a massive sacrifice to your well being, health, and happiness.

[],,robobeg,,,[],,,,text,t2_15zfag82,False,False,,"1. I begin to suspect whether you confuse SK with NK. The Board of Audit and Inspection is a constitutional, independent institute in SK. It is just ignorant of just calling it 'the government', like calling the Court or the National Assembly 'the government'. Just recall the relationship between the ex-chairman of BAI and the Blue House and what he is doing now. And you also had better recall what happened to the ex-President who abused her power. Unless SK is under emergency (was it?), a new legislation is required to guarantee release of liability to officials, which would require lengthy discussions with comprehensive, cooperarive oppositions under friently media environment. 

2. And yes, we keep ordering flu vaccines every year so were we able to order covid vaccines like that? There were no such things as covid vaccines last year! There were a handful of vaccine hopefuls and the government had to decide to gamble on which and when. I said GAMBLE. ( Then, goto item 1. ) And blaming the SK government for every single event so far such as India's covid crisis, AZ/Moderna's manufactural failures seems just silly. As far as I know, other governments also have suffered from Moderna's irregular supplies and didn't get written contracts specifying explicit delivery schedules from it except US. Very sorry that SK is not like the almighty US. 

But consequently, if the SK government had not been able to secure enough vaccines so SK had remained in covid pandemic while other countries with a vacccine success had returned to normalcy, we could blame the SK governmrnt for the consequence. But such fantasy has not became reality. So what's your point? Now vaccine is just one of many quarantine measures. By mass vaccination, we just expect that the R-value would be lowered and to control the pandemic would come a bit easier with mask wearing and social distancing.",,,,1632226200,,{},hdpit80,True,t3_prlq9n,False,True,t1_hdoyjid,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prlq9n/s_korea_new_cases_slightly_over_1600_concerns/hdpit80/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,4de0d4894a658a9554cd1b410f19e89f45e14be4,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1632226212.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

I get take out a lot, it sucks not going out anymore but regardless of 💉 status, I don’t know who is carrying the virus and who isn’t, unless u test before entering an area, most likely someone has it, and are asymptotic and spreading it! And this is more so because 💉 people are mostly asymptotic, and doctors gloss over this when discussing the 💉. Meanwhile a large amount of people are spreading it and do not know they have it.

The cruise ships are 100% 💉 and people r still testing positive on it! And then after they leave it. Needless to say that shows how many do have the virus and have 💉 and a study just released 25% of hospitalized are 💉. Ofc there r less hospitalized as the 💉 is keeping them from getting really sick or catching the disease side of the virus. (Long haul)

There r numerous studies proving that the particles smaller than the holes, so many still pass thru, with n95 or surgical, as for cloth it stops the majority of the coughs and sneeze sprays to stay in, but people pull down their masks to SNEEZE! 🤦‍♀️ again regardless of 💉 u can’t stop stupid! The logic is truly flawed. 

And to the man wearing a mask alone in ur car, pulling it down to pick ur nose, then lifting it back up does absolutely nothing in protecting u from spreading the virus! Do people truly think wearing the mask is protecting them alone in their car, but picking ur nose without the mask on and wiping it on ur shirt, does spread it quickly, then touching ur steering well and everything else after without sanitizing ur hand! And omg ur literally picking ur nose, ur 70 u know better! Get a tissue!

Sorry that is the one favorite i have in the last 2 years! Lol! Just dumbfounded! 

But there r countless things people do on a daily basis, and think they r fine and refuse to get tested, I’m vaccinated I’m fine! Like 🤦‍♀️ r u kidding me?

They emphasize fomite and droplet transmission as expected, but more interesting in hindsight is that they seem to assume that COVID-19 would spread **more slowly** than the flu:

&gt;The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19.

They acknowledge that the reproductive number for COVID-19 is considerably higher (actually it's more than enough to offset the longer serial interval), but ""estimates for both COVID-19 and influenza viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct comparisons more difficult"", so they seem to just run with the idea that COVID-19 will spread more slowly.

And here they assume that transmission by people without symptoms, while a factor in influenza, would ***not*** be a major factor with COVID-19, despite awareness that people could shed virus while not showing symptoms yet:

&gt;Further, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre-symptomatic transmission –transmission of the virus before the appearance of symptoms – is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, **while we are learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver of transmission.** \[emphasis added by redditor\]

NIH did a study that was published in science magazine saying infection was 98% effective in stopping future infection for one month, 92% effective in stopping it for six months, and an unspecified partial effectiveness after 8 months.

JAMA produced an article looking at people who were infected and then received the vaccine versus people who did not, and found 50x more effectiveness among those who had both versus just infection

Perelman school of medicine at UPenn showed 80% effectiveness in just infection and 95% in the vaccinated (but uninfected), with infection immunity waning after 3 months where vaccinated immunity wanes much later.

that's all of 5 second of googling. so hypothetically, and taking much of this information and synthesizing it, even by your definition of herd immunity all it would take is a shot every six months to knock out covid. yes people who refuse the shot will keep getting infected but that's true of all the other diseases you've mentioned before too. when there's a measles outbreak it's among those unvaccinated, or polio overseas.

From the article: 

“The researchers also found that while the vaccination offers significant protection against the Delta variant, the vaccines are less effective than against previous variants.”

“Vaccines are a key tool in the world’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While measures such as washing hands, social distancing, and wearing masks are still important, the effectiveness of the vaccines has been a success story of the pandemic.”

“Despite tremendous efforts by Member States to vaccinate people across the region, millions more remain unvaccinated and therefore at risk of ending up in [the] hospital.”

“The good news is that the data clearly shows that receiving a full vaccination series significantly reduces the risk of severe disease and death. When called to do so, people should get vaccinated,” says Dr. Kluge.”

From the reference study: 

“Effectiveness of two doses remains at least as great as protection afforded by prior natural infection. The dynamics of immunity following second doses differed significantly between BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, with greater initial effectiveness against new PCR-positives but faster declines in protection against high viral burden and symptomatic infection with BNT162b2. There was no evidence that effectiveness varied by dosing interval, but protection was higher among those vaccinated following a prior infection and younger adults. With Delta, infections occurring following two vaccinations had similar peak viral burden to those in unvaccinated individuals. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination still reduces new infections, but effectiveness and attenuation of peak viral burden are reduced with Delta.”",,,,1632239269,,{},hdqaxq6,False,t3_prsbj3,False,False,t1_hdq7vnr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prsbj3/covid19_vaccine_for_5_to_11yearolds_is_safe_and/hdqaxq6/,1632364352.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

You may have been to 3 hospitals with family members who had covid (which in itself is telling) but we came extremely close to total collapse of our healthcare system.  Hallways filled with dozens of patients, hospital parking garages converted into covid medical ward tents, and a single digit number of total ICU beds available across the ENTIRE STATE.  Don't know about you, but that seems pretty bad to me.

That's half the size of New Orleans, a quarter the size of Memphis, and a tiny fraction of the millions that live in places like Dallas or Houston.  And that's our LARGEST city by far.  

MS is a rural state, with a low population.  Beating covid should arguably be EASIER here.  We have less than 3 million people in total and they are spread out.  Yet we have the highest death rate per capita while extremely population dense California has almost 40 million people living on top of each other and has a death rate that's nearly HALF of ours.  

But that's OK, I'm sure there's nothing more the governor could possibly do other than remove mask mandates, fully open everything without restriction, push all the kids back to in person school, and leave vaccination as a political talking point.

They think of themselves much in the same manner as aristocrats in feudalism and emperors in hegemonic states like Rome. Superior in every way as a cope to stay put in a system they would otherwise reject out of concern for their fellow man and therefore leave or try to change the system for the better. And that's before your mind get's virused by corporate culture, to pervert your empathic, human instincts, and make you fall in line with your high-class cronies. And this inspite of the fact they're objectively more degenerate than the people they dehumanized. 

The owner class has more freedom in terms of material wealth, but in freedom of thought, that isn't the case. One small bit of resistance inside of the owner class, another meaningful disagreement about systemic change, and the game is up.

The Phizer and Moderna vaccines must be kept at sub-zero temperatures, and have considerably shorter expiration dates than the Janssen.

That was also part of the appeal of the single dose. Many people need to travel exceedingly far distances to get medical care, plus supply routes have been continuously strained. Having a single dose vector allows manufacturing to get resistance to more people, and prevents the need for follow-up visits, while also being incredibly effective at preventing death from the illness should the vaccinated individual become infected.

Viral Vaccines aren't a cure. They're body armor. It'll save your life, but getting shot sucks no matter how you shake a stick at it.

It feels like people have completely forgotten how different life was even at the start of this year. At this point people are living as if there is basically no pandemic. You can go to indoor sports events, concerts, anything you could do in February of 2020. In the states that are doing the worst, there are often no mask mandates, and low rates of vaccination. And even in places with high rates of vaccination, there’s usually still 20% or more of eligible people who aren’t vaccinated, and that’s not including people who aren’t eligible (such as kids).

I live in Los Angeles county, 67% of our county is fully vaccinated, that’s almost 6 million people. But there’s still almost 3 million people out there who are eligible that aren’t fully vaccinated, and around 2 million of them haven’t had one shot. We’re doing relatively okay because of mask mandates and vaccine mandates to attend events, but I can easily understand why it looks so bad in other places that don’t have those measures in place.

From a legal perspective they have a right to kick someone out if they dont like what they are doing. Wearing masks and being vaccinated are not protected classes, and ultimately both are a choice albeit a smart one. It would be hypocritical for people in here to say it's okay for Twitter to ban anyone they want because they are a private business and applaud when anti-mask people are kicked out of a business for not wearing their mask on the premise, but then say they can't kick someone out for wanting to wear a mask when it's not mandated by law.

I also don't think you can just easily chalk up your workplace being racist because upper management is from Calgary.  You're really grasping at straws and painting an entire province in a particular light to fit your framing when it isn't all like that.  Calgary has a lot of progressive people, Edmonton even more so.  I say this while recognizing that Alberta at large is way more conservative and reactionary than I'd prefer, and there's a lot that frustrates me about the province.  However, I'm not going to play into tired stereotypes and blame the province's populace for everything gone wrong in other places.  But also BC loves to point the finger and dunk on Alberta, if we're getting into stereotypes and despite BC's progressive image, it can often be anything but, and that's without Alberta's help.

British Columbians have this annoying tendency to feel superior to the rest of Canada and it's quite stupid.  Not everybody wants to live in Vancouver.  Many do, sure, but many also find it sterile, boring, and lacking.  It's certainly no Montreal, or even Seattle.

Regarding colonial violence, again, that is a bad way of thinking about it.  Just because every part of North America has experienced violence against Indigenous peoples does not discount or brush off what happens in BC.

No.

&gt; Polio was eliminated (meaning no ongoing spread of the disease for more than 12 months) in the United States in 1979. We continue to vaccinate our nation’s children knowing that the disease still occurs in other parts of the world and could easily be brought into the U.S. https://www.cdc.gov/dotw/polio/

Big difference between Covid and Measles is that Covids reservoir is not only in humans, but also on many animals. This is different to measles:

&gt; Animals do not get or spread measles. https://www.cdc.gov/measles/transmission.html

A better analogy would be other corona viruses, that are (also) endemic, and pretty much circulate in every population so rapidly half of the 3 to 5 year olds have caught it, and almost everyone till their 15th birthday:

&gt; https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6530/741
&gt; The rapid rise in both IgM and IgG seroprevalence indicates that primary infection with all four endemic HCoV strains happens early in life, and our analysis of these data gives us an estimate for the mean age of primary infection (MAPI) between 3.4 and 5.1 years, with almost everyone infected by age 15 (see SM section 1 for details). The absence of detectable IgM titers in any individual over the age of 15 years suggests that reinfection of adults causes a recall response, indicating that while HCoV-specific immunity may wane, it is not lost. Whether immunity would wane to naïve levels in the absence of high pathogen circulation remains an open question.

We have had the chance to contain Covid in early 2020, but now its off the table, havign spread everywhere.

Some ivermectin proponents are adamant that its a cure (which is nuts). Some ivermectin opponents are adamant that it has zero benefit (which is premature). So far, my reading of the better trials is that it may have a benefit, but if it does, any benefit is modest (think 10-15%). Certainly not a replacement for vaccination, respirator masks, and better ventilation. 

If that's the scale of benefit, it would be comparable to some of the expensive monoclonal antibody treatments in use now (which are also no replacement for vaccination, respirator masks, and better ventilation). But 10%-15%, given the low risks at correct dosing, would still be worthwhile, especially in the developing world where monoclonal antibody infusion clinics aren't an option.

To discern that sort of modest benefit with statistically significant results, one requires large (hundreds in each arm), well-conducted randomized trials in the hospitalized, or really large randomized trials (thousands in each arm) in prophylaxis.

&gt; Humans are the only natural hosts of the virus, and no other animal reservoirs are known to exist

That means that even if every single human were immune, that may not be enough to eradicate the virus.

And while the COVID-19 vaccines we have work quite well, they're nowhere near as effective as the measles vaccine which is 99%+ effective (from the same Wikipedia article on Measles):
&gt; The MMR vaccine is 95% effective for preventing measles after one dose if the vaccine is given to a child who is 12 months or older; if a second dose of the MMR vaccine is given, it will provide immunity in 99% of children.[74]

Future COVID-19 vaccines will likely improve on the effectiveness, of course.

But also, despite being easier, measles is nowhere near being eradicated and eradicating measles is at best a multi-decade project. Polio eradication is also at best several years away after several decades of work, and 1-2 decades is probably safer bet.

I'm looking at my city's data (New York) and am starting to wonder at what point it's not really useful. There are a few reasons:

* 81% of adults and 69% of all residents have had at least one vaccine dose.
* Cases during the current wave peaked at slightly below 2,000 (moving average) in mid-August, which is 68.9% below the winter peak.
* The hospitalization trendline is even more staggering. Hospital admissions peaked in mid-August, but were 71% below where they were in February and 93% below the first wave. They're steadily falling as well.
* We haven't had more than 20 deaths in a given day *at all* during this wave.
* This is all happening while the actual rate of transmission hovers between 130 and 140/100,000, even with schools back in session. 

So obviously vaccines have completely broken the chain, further aided by passports.

Yet when an alcoholic drinks or a drug addict smokes/shoots nicotine or their other drug of choice, they're denied transplants, because they're trashing their own bodies.

That's the proper application of medical ethics.

Reeves, the Mississippi governor, is presiding over one of the most devastating outbreaks not just in America, but the world. But in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday, he defended his response, making clear he would not do anything different.  
“Governor, if Mississippi were a country, you would have the second worst per capita death toll in the world,” a weary-looking Tapper told Reeves. “And I’m saying: Are you going to do anything to try to change that?”  
“The reality is the Delta variant is very transmissible and it is moving around the country,” Reeves replied after some gibberish about deaths being a “lagging indicator.” “If you want to talk about cases right now, talk about Kentucky or West Virginia or what’s happening in North Carolina or moving into southern Virginia.”

I'll use the Pfizer vaccine as an example, because that's the one that I got two doses of.  Short answer, it's 95% effective at preventing laboratory-confirmed infection.

Here is the source of my information, the CDC, which is the federal\\country-level health agency where I live in the USA.  The CDC article also cites sources, but those are beyond my technical ability to understand and interpret:  [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html)

&gt;Based on evidence from clinical trials in people 16 years and older, the Pfizer-BioNTech (COMIRNATY) vaccine was **95% effective at preventing laboratory-confirmed infection with the virus that causes COVID-19 in people who received two doses and had no evidence of being previously infected.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
In clinical trials, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was also highly effective at preventing laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection in adolescents 12–15 years old, and the immune response in people 12–15 years old was at least as strong as the immune response in people 16–25 years old.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
The vaccine was also highly effective in clinical trials at preventing COVID-19 among people of diverse age, sex, race, and ethnicity categories and among people with underlying medical conditions.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Evidence shows mRNA COVID-19 vaccines offer similar protection in real-world conditions as they have in clinical trial settings―reducing the risk of COVID-19, including severe illness by 90% or more, among people who are fully vaccinated.

But I don't know exactly what you're thinking here, however most flu deaths happen between November and March, that's when covid was the worst it has yet been and a lot more people were following the rules. Also, a huge number of adults worked from home rather than the office, and businesses and workplaces often didn't allow people to enter or clock in with a fever. The fact that US workers are often expected to come into work when sick is one of the main vectors of flu spread, and that was dramatically reduced.

While no one seems to care about masks anymore, they really did during flu season.

Regardless, even if your conspiratorial instincts were true and this would have been an extremely severe flu year, there were 500k excess deaths in 2020, we haven't seen a flu season like that since 1918. Covid was responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths, even if you take 64k off of it. Even if you double it and take 128k off of it because you think it would have been the worst flu season in a century.

Seems the headline from USA Today may be misleading also.

My reading of the WBIR article is that Tennessee Dept. of Health is recommending to prioritize non-vaccinated, when it comes to distribution of their limited monoclonal antibody treatment supply.

This is supposedly in-line with NIH recommendations, due to the fact that antibody treatment is intended to reduce severity of COVID-19 and vaccinated individuals already have such protection.

So, it's not TN DoH just going off and irrationally or unreasonably cutting off vaccinated people from monoclonal antibody treatment - as may be inferred from the USA Today headline.

[],,EmbarrassedPenalty,,,[],,,,text,t2_1worsu2j,False,False,[],"&gt;	u/zorinlynx is absolutely correct about the meaning of herd immunity in this context 

No Zorinlynx says we will achieve herd immunity when it becomes endemic. So either they misunderstood the meaning of “herd immunity” or they misunderstood the meaning of “endemic”

“Herd immunity” means not enough vulnerable hosts for the pathogen to propagate. “Endemic” means propagate indefinitely but manageable. They are mutually exclusive. 

Hence my question. If health experts are saying they predict coronavirus will become endemic is this a tacit admission that herd immunity is impossible?

&gt;	Providing “no hosts” for the disease is eradication, something that most countries (except for Australia and NZ) gave up on well over a year ago. That isn’t going to happen.

There are other diseases that went from worldwide to eradicated. Escape from wuhan was never a guarantee that the same couldn’t occur for COVID-19. 

But it sounds like you are now conceding that yes herd immunity is now an impossibility?

&gt;lethality … hospitalizations

Sure. I’m not disputing that reducing the lethality and hospitalization rates are worthy goals nor that the vaccines are the best tools for achieving those goals.

Death is not the only factor involved. Long Covid is a pretty major issue in kids, and kids spreading Covid to unvaccinated adults is a major strain on our healthcare system. 

&gt;Young kids getting a new vaccine, of which we do not know the long term side effects of is borderline child endangerment.

This is a process similar to every other vaccine we have ever given kids. We aren't gonna wait 50 years to see how kids in trials grow old and die. We can't trial run tests on ten million kids just to make sure we get solid data on all of the super-rare possibilities that might occur. All we do is use the best science available to make the best possible predictions, and go with those. As far as vaccines go, it's literally never let us down as a species.

Borderline child endangerment is having hospitals performing triage. Mortality among hospitalized covid patients [most recently has been pegged around 6.5%](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2777028). To put those figures into a triage perspective, a child hospitalized with _any_ illness or injury could be passed over for an ICU bed because their odds of survival were lower than 93.5%.

A gas station worker in the town of Idar-Oberstein, Rhineland-Palatinate, lost his life after a dispute with a customer over COVID-19 measures, police said Monday.

According to the police report, a 49-year-old man is suspected of having shot the gas station employee Saturday evening, over a mask-wearing requirement at the establishment.

What happened at the gas station?

The man is said to have entered the gas station to make a purchase without wearing a face mask and the 20-year-old employee asked him to comply with the regulation. The two allegedly got into an argument, which prompted the maskless man to leave.

But according to police, the man is said to have returned roughly an hour later. This time, he was wearing a mask but he took it off and the two men started another argument. The suspect then pulled a concealed revolver out of his pocket and shot the 20-year-old.  

Senior public prosecutor Kai Fuhrmann told DPA that the victim died after a fatal shot to the head. After the incident, the suspect is said to have fled on foot. 

What did the suspect say?

Authorities arrived at the scene and started a search for the man. But the following day, the 49-year-old walked into the police station and confessed to the crime.

The man allegedly told officers that he was against COVID-19 restrictive measures and that the coronavirus pandemic situation had greatly stressed him, Fuhrmann said.

He felt cornered and ""saw no other way out"" than to set an example. The suspect held the victim  ""responsible for the overall situation, because he enforced the rules,"" Fuhrmann added.

The police department of the city of Trier said the shooting was the first incident related to coronavirus measures in the area and in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

The mayor of Idar-Oberstein, Frank Frühauf, expressed his shock and dismay over the crime. ""This is a quite inconceivable, terrible act that has happened here in Idar-Oberstein,"" he said.

""Such a crime is unprecedented. It will take a while time to come to terms with it,"" he added.",,,,1632175491,,{},hdn8pk0,True,t3_ps4x9y,False,False,t3_ps4x9y,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ps4x9y/germany_gas_station_employee_killed_over_a_face/hdn8pk0/,1632293066.0,358,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm guessing what most people care about is the expected amount of harm, i.e. (risk of event) × (amount of harm if the event happens).

I'm somewhat optimistic about the rest of the pandemic in the US, although it is far from over.  Cases are going way down now in the deep south and also in many western states (California, Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico), and while they are starting to increase in the Midwest and Northeast, most of these states have good vaccination rates and shouldn't get as bad as it did in the south.  

I think that nationwide cases will continue dropping until around December 1st, where we will see a holiday/winter wave like we did last year, but with vaccines and natural immunity I don't think it will be nearly as bad as the current Delta wave we're seeing.

Paul Elliott, an epidemiologist at Imperial, says that these results differ from other Ct studies because this study sampled the population at random and included people who tested positive without showing symptoms.

Ok so the book is not closed on the question of vaxed having same viral load. And as others have pointed out, even with same viral load, there's a lower chance of infection.

So maybe there still is hope of herd immunity?

&gt;Eradication have never been in the books, to the best of my knowledge. Covid have too many animal hosts, ... it will find it's way back to humans when we stop.

Is this virus known to cross species? I thought they were undecided whether it had zoonotic origin, or escape from lab?

Anyway, you're saying now, no, we can never achieve herd immunity?

&gt;even if we had a 100% effective vaccine and vaccinated 100% of the population

What? with a 100% vaccine of 100% of the population, the virus will find no hosts, right? animals can keep it.

&gt;the hope is that Covid will be something like the common cold, with light burden on society. There is also the possibility that it will be something like the seasonal flu, with medium burden on society.

The point of herd immunity is that it protects the unvaccinated. Infants and immunocompromised. COVID will always present the same risk to that group.

When human populations increase the environment is harmed.  Yes, we're currently doing millions of things that are *also* harmful to the environment which aren't helping that, but removing all of them still won't solve the problem unless overpopulation is also addressed.

It's important to start thinking of this issue now because it's going to get much much worse in the coming decades. Climate change has already started a historic mass migration of human beings [whose numbers may be staggering](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/10/world/climate-global-displacement-report-intl-hnk-scli-scn/index.html) and the US should do everything we can to help take in climate refugees. At the same time, a huge percentage of our population lives along the costs and climate change is expected to force many of those people inland. Many of those large empty areas in the western US will be subject to drought and desertification and may not be able to support large populations either. The US is going to get a lot more crowded in the near future. Population (and population density) in the US and around the world will be increasing and the problem can't be ignored just because it makes us uncomfortable or because of fears it might threaten our financial or political goals. Finding solutions really is going to be a major problem on its own, but the science isn't talking about solutions, it's just demonstrating the reality of the problem and predicting the harms if it continues to be ignored.

Biden won in part ***because*** he campaigned against single payer (i.e. Bernie's idea of M4A). M4A implemented as a public option polls exceptionally well. M4A implemented as a nationalized healthcare plan (no private insurance) does not poll well.

You want to blame Biden and Pelosi? Biden is the guy who just takes the median Democrat position, which is why he's trying to push a $3.5 **trillion** plan. The problem is Democrats don't overwhelmingly support single payer -- [only 54%](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/29/increasing-share-of-americans-favor-a-single-government-program-to-provide-health-care-coverage/). Forget about Independents and Republicans.

At some point, the blame goes to the voters. Get more people on board with single payer (and I'm one of them, to be clear) and it'll get passed through. Move the Overton Window left. People are always so quick to blame politicians but the problem lies with the voters.

No I'm not. Distrust of bad evidence and conspiracy theories is one of the best ways to *not* ""contribute to the mess"". 
  
&gt; You immediately dismiss any information from REAL DOCTORS that doesn’t fit the narrative you been fed why?
  
No. I didn't say anything about narrative. You're really struggling to not put words in my mouth. I didn't say anything about narrative. I said ""i'm not basing my world view off of bad evidence or conspiracy theories"". This is regardless of narrative. If the thing I believe is wrong, *I want to know about it*. So if someone has evidence, I'll be likely to believe them. If someone has no evidence, or bad evidence, I won't.
  
&gt; Why in the world do you think social media CEOS have your best interests in mind?
  
*Again*, I didn't say that. 
  
&gt; That’s exactly what you mean because you’ve already dismissed the doctors that have concerns.
  
No, that's ***not*** what I mean. And I'm not dismissing any doctors or experts. I'm saying I'm dismissive of those who base their point on bad evidence or conspiracy theories. 
  
&gt; So yes, you only mean eery doctor and expert out there that has the same opinion, walks the line, and hasn’t been censored off the internet, yet.
  
No I don't. This has nothing to do with opinion. It's about *evidence*. Stop using simple minded straw men to misrepresent what I say. If you want to know what I ""mean"", then just ask.
