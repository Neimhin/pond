"" Eulerian–Lagrangian modeling of cough droplets irradiated by ultraviolet–C light in relation to SARS-CoV-2 transmission""

*Physics of Fluids* ***33***\*, 031905 (2021)\*

ABSTRACT

It is well known that several viruses, as well as SARS-CoV-2, can be transmitted through airborne diffusion of saliva micro-droplets. For this reason, many research groups have devoted their efforts in order to gain new insight into the transport of fluids and particles originated from human respiratory tracts. This paper aims to provide a contribution to the numerical modeling of saliva droplets' diffusion produced by coughing. It is worth noting that droplets' diameters of interest in this work are such that represent typical emission during a cough. Aerosolization effects are neglected since emitted droplets' diameters are greater than 10 *µ*m. In particular, the well-known problem around the safety distance to be held for avoiding virus transmission in the absence of external wind is further investigated. Thus, new indices capable of evaluating the contamination risk are introduced, and the possibility to inactivate virus particles by means of an external ultraviolet-C (UV-C) radiation source is studied. For this purpose, a new model which takes into account biological inactivation deriving from UV-C exposure in an Eulerian–Lagrangian framework is presented.**I.**",,,1615337547,{},gqe82d5,True,t3_m1l69q,False,True,t3_m1l69q,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m1l69q/ultraviolet_light_could_slow_the_spread_of/gqe82d5/,1615340901,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Now if say I was going to the dentist. Well then wearing a mask would restrict the services I could receive so therefore I would not have to wear a mask.

What the order says is no local orders can be put in place that restrict services. Which in a legal sense can be argued that as long as the mask does not need to be removed to recieve those services then a mask mandate is okay because access to those services is not restricted.

Additionally a private company can require you to wear a mask on the premises or ask you to leave. You see it all the time ""no shirt, no shoes, no service,"" ""we don't have to serve gay people here,"" ""you must wear a mask while shopping.""

In fact, it's the anti-ChAd immunity waning that makes the 12 week regimen more efficacious than the 4 week one. 

You can see JnJ opting for that (12 week interval) in their ongoing clinical trials of a 2 dose regimen, probably for the same reason. The reason it's probably for the same reason (aside from the Ramasamy et al paper literally talking about it) is the fact that Sputnik V is the only 2 dose viral vector vaccine that is being given in a 3 week regimen and it's also the only vaccine to be using two different vectors in their two doses.

You want significance to be attached to your accusation of murder, but your own logic dictates that the vast majority of people if not all are murderers because they merely allow others to do things that may lead to their deaths.

Your own definition of murderer entirely removes any significance to the claim. So why the fuck should I care if you say Greg Abbott is a murder if you think Habib who works at the local convenience store that sells cigarettes is also a murder? The accusation is utterly without meaning when you apply it so broadly.

And I only bring up ""some early 1900's Russian politician"" to highlight how utterly gullible you are in your use of COVID statistics. You wholly believe and cite Chinese COVID statistics (which have no chance of being close to accurate) because it fits your narrative that America is bad. This is why I call you a useful idiot. Because you use obviously fake statistics to prove your point. If only we had an authoritarian regime that doesn't give a fuck about civil liberties, human rights or freedom of the press like Ji Xinpeng's, America could boast the same falsely low COVID numbers as China.

It's not a matter of being right or wrong. I'm arguing a position, namely that state governments should not primarily rule with top-down dictates and should allow people and municipalities decide what they want to do with their lives. Just as I don't support a national mask mandate, I don't support state-wide mask mandates either. I think people should be free to choose their own course in life.

Personally, I wear a mask, just as I cover my mouth when I cough. It's a small courtesy that I can do to be polite to others. But I'm not going to tell someone who has either recovered from COVID or who has been vaccinated that they must wear a mask, despite no chance of spreading the disease. Nor am I going to demand that the government use the threat of force inherent in government to make people bend to my will. I'm not an authoritarian asshole who wants to dictate what other people can and can't do with their lives.

Let me ask one more question. My parents had COVID last November and have fully recovered. They've also, at the recommendation of their doctor, gotten the vaccination. Should they still be forced to wear masks in public? Considering there's zero chance they can' transmit COVID anymore, what is your rationale for forcing them to wear a mask?

13% of deaths are the result of cancer. 12% are heart failure. 11% are natural causes/uncategorized, 9% are accidents, 7% lung disease, etc. 

2% of the world dies every year. We can divvy that up however you like and call everyone murderers. 

As far as smoking - if I put a gun to your head and pull the trigger and you die immediately, I am a murderer. If I give you some poison in your food and you die 2 weeks later, I'm a murderer. If I sell you a pack of cigarettes and you keep coming back for them due to your addiction for 15,000 straight days - and every day, I tell you to stop buying these and offer products to help you stop buying them, I am a murderer.

How is it ""clearly obvious""? I'm just taking your logic about COVID and applying it to tobacco. If you think governors are murderers for lifting mask/lockdown orders, then why aren't they equally murderers for not banning all tobacco products? What is the significant difference? COVID has killed around 500,000 people in the past year. Tobacco has killed 480,000 people in the past year. In terms of mortality, they're pretty equivalent. So where is your condemnation of virtually every single politician failing to ban tobacco and calling them murderers for their failure? You sure had no problem calling politicians who are lifting statewide restrictions as responsible murdering anyone who succumbs to COVID. So why don't you equally call politicians who do not impose restrictions on tobacco as murderers?

&gt;As far as your other question - I definitely blame Biden for not implementing a federal mask mandate. I think that's just pathetic leadership. 

So Joe Biden is a murderer?

&gt;However, considering your previous president was telling people to drink bleach to stop the virus, (or whatever the fuck was coming out of that pathetic excuse for a man's mouth) - your current senile old man president just doing nothing is an improvement. 

This is little more than whataboutism. 

&gt;But like I said, you account for 25% of the death toll of a virus with 4% of the worlds' population.

I think you're trusting official statistics a little too much. Do you really believe that China has had only 4,848 deaths from COVID? But then again, you are a bit of an authoritarian who wants to impose your will on everyone around you, so of course you'd trust a Communist government who imprisons dissidents who contradict the official narrative. If you believe the official Chinese numbers, you're a bigger fool than you sound. Just look at the world map.

No, you were just not clear enough, I think. 

&gt;The booster lowering efficacy compared to letting a single dose play out makes perfect sense. That's why Sputnik V opted to use 2 different adenoviruses...to circumvent the vector immunity. 

The booster shot not increasing efficacy is what makes sense and why Sputnik V opted for 2 different vectors. You are the one strawmanning *me* now 😅😂. I said that efficacy *dropping* as a result of the second dose is what does *not* make sense and you said that it did, vaguely citing anti-vector immunity as the reason. 

&gt;Now, I agree 1 dose of J&amp;J could very well reach into the 80s if given enough time to reach peak antibody levels.

I never said that 😂😂 I said that it was imaginable that a second dose could push it to 80%. 

&gt;That would make it the best single dose we have so far.

As of right now, it's definitely not the best, be it overall or compared to other vaccines' one dose regimens. 

&gt;It could very well be the case that the booster modestly increases efficacy, but increases duration to a substantial degree.

That's the case. It's well established and researched. The second dose is definitely gonna increase the duration of the immunity. It's highly unlikely to have a significant impact on efficacy.

-if the same booster can be used as the beginning of a two dose regimen for someone who has not yet been vaccinated.

At roughly the time the J&amp;J study results were announced, the prevalence is estimated to only be 1-4% in the US depending on location.  

We've got decreased population density compared to the UK, have heavily restricted international travel, and we also never had a full reopening in 2020 on the scale of the UK's ""eat out to help out"" scheme (which likely played a large part in seeding the new variants there).

The variants are definitely here and will spread - they just haven't meaningfully yet.  There are lots of expectations for a fourth wave if we aren't able to deploy vaccines rapidly enough, which is why there's so much urgency.  In the last few weeks they've gone from 1-4% to 10% of cases, and that's expected to increase rapidly going forward...

Texas is low in per capita vaccination rates, but has consistently used a significant portion of its allotted doses.

States don't receive equal numbers of vaccine doses per capita from the Federal government, meaning states can do a fantastic job getting shots in arms but ultimately fail to vaccinate as many because they don't have the doses.

For example, Alaska has given 25% of its population at least a single dose, but has used 70% of its doses. Texas, meanwhile, has used 75% of its doses but has only given 16% of the population at least one dose.

Assuming Texas used 100% of its doses, it would be able to get around 21% of its population vaccinated with a single dose, assuming the same ratio of single doses to fully vaccinated. It would still lose to Alaska no matter how great a job it did.

It's unclear to me how the Feds are allocating doses. I'd bet median age is a factor, but not the only factor, as we'll see.

Texas has a low median age; it is one of the youngest states. Given how heavily age impacts death rates, it makes sense to me that Texas has a lower allocation of doses. Utah is also young, has high vaccine utilization, but a low allocation. Again, it makes sense to me.

It now makes me wonder why Alaska, which is just slightly younger than Texas, has such a high allocation of doses. Or why South Carolina, which is older, has a lower allocation, despite high utilization.",,,1615381592,{},gqfwel3,False,t3_m1h1xa,False,True,t1_gqf4ga6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m1h1xa/austin_texas_fourthlargest_city_keeping_mask/gqfwel3/,1615381603,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

now the county starts getting an allotment based on their population and an allotment based on the number of elderly, and the state maybe put a minimum on each order so every county always got at least 50 per day, etc etc

If it's safe, how is this a maybe, could you elaborate? There are half a million dead and many more who have suffered in this country alone. The vaccine causes some arm pain but that's about it for most people. I think it's a clear tradeoff. I mean I get a flu shot whenever offered and have a tone of other vaccines. Strong vaccination programs means we don't worry about thinks like polio and smallpox today, in fact we don't even need those vaccines anymore in the US.

&gt;You wish to boil things down to binary yes/no good/bad. Life is not binary and response to risk is not binary.

In this case it is very binary, if the vaccine is safe and prevents harm, what's the downside? I'm not seeing any concrete downsides. Arm pain? The fact it'll take a few hours of your time? Tax/insurance dollars? What is it?

&gt;For example, you think the only discussion relevant here is the vaccine. You do this because you think it gives you a superior argument, not because it's actually the only thing relevant.

No, I ignore the rest because I fully agree we shouldn't be locked down. Regardless of what you think of a vaccine and covid itself. Without any government mandates people WILL be afraid of eating indoors and going to gyms and etc... A vaccine fixes this and makes people start going to these things, more doctor visits, less afraid of socialising. This has nothing to do with mandates and just how people are reacting. If you want life to go back to normal mass vaccination is the best route EVEN IF you think covid isn't a big deal. The reason I don't want to talk about lockdown is because both of us agree, we shouldn't be locked down. And the easiest quickest way to renormalizing is mass vaccination. Just like you have people who refuse to wear masks despite government mandates, you'd have people refusing to dine indoors even if the government said it's safe - until we all have the vaccine and covid is no longer prevalent.

&gt;If I had a safe and effective vaccine to deaths by milk jug drownings, do you think it would be relevant to discuss the number of deaths and vulnerability to milk jug drownings? Of course it would, it would be asinine to put everyone through a vaccine for something that might happen to only 2 people a year, no matter how safe and effective it is.

Covid has killed 500,000 people in this country and harmed tens millions including my uncle who's not part of the dead but will never have a productive happy again. Are you saying dead americans aren't a big deal to you? We're not talking 2 people a year we're talking a disease that's hitting millions. 

My brother got sick and he's in his 20's you know what happened? He took 3 days off work, and stopped eating from restaurants for 2 weeks because he couldn't taste anything. Had he been vaccinated, he would have not missed any work, spent money supporting restaurants for those two weeks and have ""only"" wasted 3ish hours of his time getting vaccinated. You're right it's not binary but you're completely focused on death. He's completely fine because he's young and healthy but being sick still kinda sucks. A vaccine prevents even that relatively minor inconvenience. Just because he's not part of your 0.03% does that mean we shouldn't vaccinate? This is a disease that is affecting tens of millions of Americans whether major or minor, not milk jugs affecting 2 people or whatever.

&gt; If you are unwilling to discuss the role the covid response measures have had in comparison to the damage covid itself has done, then there is no discussion you be had. No matter how safe and effective the vaccine may be.

I am willing to discuss it and I just did, and we actually agree here on lockdowns. My actual thoughts were:

We all needed to do a much better job of wearing masks, and have had no lockdowns. If we could have excellent mask compliance and no lockdowns less people would have died overall and our economy wouldn't have been hurt. Japan is a prime example of this. Regardless of whether you're for or against lockdown, for or against masks, a vaccine is the best way to get things back to normal. Even if you thought covid was a complete non issue, how will you convince people who currently think covid is going to kill them to go eat at restaurants again? Vaccinate them.

I'm willing to discuss since you did answer the questions finally. Now we can have a frank discussion now knowing you're not one of these people saying the vaccine is going to kill us all or microchip us or whatever crazy stuff comes out. I get you have an ideological need to not get it, fine. But there are tons of people who will not go back to normal until covid numbers are no longer high. And vaccination combined with mask usage is the best way to reduce those numbers.

Now we need to wear two masks to protect against a disease that 99.5% of people survive. The average age of a person who dies from coronavirus is well into their 70s.  

For some reason, the United States, despite having a tiny fraction of the world's population and one of the most advanced health care systems in human history, is responsible for one out of every four coronavirus deaths worldwide. That number is statistically impossible.  

The United States is so advanced that tuberculosis, which is the leading infectious cause of death worldwide, is so rare here that in all the hysteria over the last year and a half, nobody has mentioned it even once. This despite the fact it is spread identically to coronavirus.  Was anyone wearing masks to prevent tuberculosis in 2018?  Of course not. Why? Because it's not dangerous. And neither is coronavirus.  

But it really wasn't until China announced they expected Americans to stick something up their own ass to test for the disease and that people could get ""re-infected"" after being vaccinated that the whole thing went off the rails. Assholes are always too clever by half. The CDC thing was just the most recent and most obvious confirmation.

A negligible number of cases were traced back to things like dining, entertainment, sports, etc.

The reality is, there is very little correlation between the severity of restrictions and the outcome of the pandemic (at least in the US, I don't really follow other countries that closely). And if there is a correlation, it is either very weak or doesn't take into account various other factors. The government never needed to get involved to this degree, they only need to provide information for people to be able to safely function in their daily lives and provide resources to those who are affected by the illness - i.e. harm reduction. It is no one individual's fault for catching or spreading this virus and we all need to realize that.

Restrictions that are as invasive as these typically only lead to more harmful behaviors in private, non-compliance, and just general mistrust.

I was very worried as we were going into March. I think I was concerned a bit earlier than most people because I was getting semiweekly briefings at the beginning of my globalization class that I was taking. The talks were getting more serious each time and she seemed to think it was going to get bad. I believed her. I had no reason not to as she presented very good information and was clearly an intelligent person. I was trying not to worry too much since there have been scares in the U.S. in the past (such as ebola, which was bad elsewhere but never got bad here), but this seemed different. I was really hoping it would just go away, but it was seeming less likely by the day. Come March, especially the second week, it was getting tough to focus on school. 

I remember when the NBA suspended the season. That was when I realized our lives were going to start getting affected in a big way. The first glimmer of this for me was when No Time To Die was delayed. It was supposed to come out in April, but was pushed back to November due to what was going on in China (huge movie market). I wondered if more movies would get delayed, but didn't realize that was the beginning of something bigger. The NBA being suspended was the ""oh, shit"" moment for me, when things started to feel really surreal. I had my last ever day of in-person college classes the next day. Most of the day was spent talking about the coronavirus and our fears. I asked for a girl's number who I sort of liked and was planning to get to know more during the rest of semester. The fact that I knew it was the last day pushed me to do it. I got rejected, but it felt good to at least do it, since I knew I probably wouldn't be coming back that semester. Most people thought we would be back within a few weeks, but shit just seemed to be bad to me. What I didn't realize is that the pandemic would last well into 2021. I still thought it would at least end in the summer or fall. Now I'm graduating in a couple months and I'm still doing online classes (my own choice to be extra careful).

I think what people fail to understand is that the number of people  protected via vaccination is still too low for broad-scale immunity and  moreover there are more infectious (and deadly) variants that are  becoming the predominant strains. Our current plateau is higher than the  summer peak, meaning reopening to this degree has us at a very high  baseline for a potential 4th peak. While the populations most vulnerable  to mortality (the elderly and healthcare workers) might be more  protected, that doesn't mean that the rest of us are safe to get COVID,  especially when one considers the protracted organ damage that can  result in moderate to severe infections. Keep in mind that COVID  aeresolizes, so there's no real practical safe level for indoor dining  since you can't wear a mask when you eat.

That’s 28.8M at a maximum, 27M on the lower bound. 36.5M guaranteed doses by June 21st apparently (cumulative from December till then), so if 90% of eligible Canadians take a shot, there will be supply to vaccinate approximately 7.8-9M of them with a 2nd dose by the end of June. Obviously, this doesn’t include any supply from J&amp;J, Novavax, or AZ, so that number could grow. 

4 months from today is July 9th, so I don’t think the 4 month limit will be hit in most cases. My larger worry is people getting 1 shot and seeing no need for the second shot because they’re fine. They won’t understand how much better their (longer-lasting) cellular immune response will be after the second.",,,1615352605,{},gqeyfpk,False,t3_m1li4c,False,True,t1_gqex016,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m1li4c/israel_as_transmission_rate_rises_above_1_virus/gqeyfpk/,1615353181,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

**Pollen exposure weakens innate defense against respiratory viruses**
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31512243/

&gt;Results: Pollen significantly diminished interferon-λ and pro-inflammatory chemokine responses of airway epithelia to rhinovirus and viral mimics and decreased nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factors. In mice infected with respiratory syncytial virus, co-exposure to pollen caused attenuated antiviral gene expression and increased pulmonary viral titers. In non-allergic human volunteers, nasal symptoms were positively correlated with airborne birch pollen abundance, and nasal birch pollen challenge led to downregulation of type I and -III interferons in nasal mucosa. In a large patient cohort, numbers of rhinoviruspositive cases were correlated with airborne birch pollen concentrations.

&gt;Conclusion: The ability of pollen to suppress innate antiviral immunity, independent of allergy, suggests that high-risk population groups should avoid extensive outdoor activities when pollen and respiratory virus seasons coincide.

The study here was to see if there was an increase in covid19 infections related to pollen as well.",,,1615367591,{},gqffvj2,False,t3_m0t8y9,False,True,t1_gq9rlud,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m0t8y9/higher_airborne_pollen_concentrations_correlated/gqffvj2/,1615367602,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; Even working from home has not protected the wealthiest, as many can afford outside childcare, which could also explain increased infection rates. 

The real difference is that the wealthiest have taken lockdowns as vacations and curfews as an opportunity to invite friends over for the night, and have not behaved as if there was a pandemic.

(I keep saying ""realistic"" because there are some people who want legitimate widespread police enforcement of strict social distancing and no one leaving their house unless absolutely necessary - regardless of opinions on that approach, there's no way it's realistic in the US)

In a hypothetical approach where the US did see an increase in mask wearing and social distancing, and a decrease in ""non-essential"" interactions, let's say cases would be 30% lower than what they have been in the US. 30% fewer cases and deaths would have been amazing, no doubt about it. But the thing with that is that we *still* would be following those restrictions around this time. As soon as people stopped being as diligent about masks and distancing, cases would immediately rise again. If cases were 30% lower than they ended up being, I still couldn't go to a concert in March 2021, because that would be the type of thing that doesn't happen in this hypothetical world. And that's my point - no one ""prolonged"" this pandemic. We could've taken more actions to prevent more deaths, but that inherently involves *more* restrictions, and as soon as we drop those restrictions, cases will shoot back up.

The EU has conceded that the UK did not ban vaccine exports, as Boris Johnson waded into a row with Brussels by publicly “correcting” the European council president over his claims about British policy.

The prime minister told MPs on Wednesday that Charles Michel, the council president and a former prime minister of Belgium, had been wrong to allege the UK had imposed a prohibition on vaccine exports.

Johnson said: “We can also be proud of the support the UK has given to the international Covid response, including the £548m we’ve donated to Covax. I, therefore, wish to correct the suggestion from the European council president that the UK has blocked vaccine exports. Let me be clear, we have not blocked the export of a single Covid-19 vaccine or vaccine components.

“This pandemic has put us all on the same side in the battle for global health. We oppose vaccine nationalism in all its forms. I trust all sides of the house will join me in rejecting this suggestion and call on our partners to work together to tackle this pandemic.”

On Tuesday, Michel, who chairs the summits of EU leaders and helps direct policy, provoked an angry reaction in Whitehall after stating in a newsletter that the UK had “imposed an outright ban on the export of vaccines or vaccine components produced on their territory”.

When asked about the claims, on Wednesday, a European commission spokesman confirmed there was no such ban. He declined to comment directly on the claims made by Michel.

“We know that different countries have got different measures in place – that doesn’t concern vaccines, as far as we understand, coming from the UK,” the spokesman said.

Officials nevertheless pointed to the lack of vaccine exports from the UK as compared to the EU as proof of the value of the European council president’s intervention. “We need some transparency on that,” one said.

In his contentious newsletter, Michel had sought to compare the EU’s exporting record to that of the UK and other countries, including the US, in response to suggestions that the bloc was verging on protectionism in barring a recent export of vaccines from Italy to Australia.

Two weeks ago Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, had also suggested that Britain and the US had blocked the export of Covid-19 vaccines. The EU has been seeking to defend its export authorisation mechanism – which forces companies to secure approval – against accusations that it is damaging vaccine supply chains.

The UK has regulations to stop profiteering on medicines and medical items such as masks but does not impose a ban on vaccine components or completed doses.

In a sign of the testy state of relations Michel’s claim about a British export ban was on Tuesday denounced by the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, as “completely false”.

The EU’s ambassador João Vale de Almeida was summoned to the Foreign Office but he was in Brussels. Instead, the EU’s charge d’affaires in London, Nicole Mannion, the Irish deputy head of the Brussels delegation to the UK, was received on Wednesday morning by Sir Philip Barton, the permanent under-secretary of the Foreign Office. Barton is understood to have conveyed the government’s irritation about the claims.

A UK government spokesman said: “This morning a senior representative of the EU’s delegation to the UK was summoned to a meeting with [Barton] to discuss the issue of incorrect assertions in recent EU communications.”

Michel tweeted on Tuesday night: “Glad if the UK reaction leads to more transparency and increased exports to EU and [other] countries. Different ways of imposing bans or restrictions on vaccines/medicines.”

EU officials declined to comment further on Michel’s tweet.

While there is no export ban or authorisation scheme in the UK, the government did ensure that vaccine doses produced by Oxford/AstraZeneca at the sites in Staffordshire and Oxford were directed in the first instance to residents in Britain. The EU has been angered by the refusal of the Anglo-Swedish firm to redirect doses in the light of production shortfalls from European facilities.

UK sources said the government had suffered supply shortfalls as heavy as those experienced by the EU, with AstraZeneca only delivering a third of what was anticipated by the end of the first quarter of 2021.

“The UK taxpayer paid for the development of this low-cost vaccine and has exported the knowhow, on a not-for-profit basis, to set up manufacturing capability all over the world,” a source added, referring to its contract with AstraZeneca.

Germany’s ambassador to Britain, Andreas Michaelis, called for an end to the sparring between the EU and UK. Michaelis, a former head of Germany’s diplomatic service, said the relationship had to improve in the wake of disputes over vaccines and the Brexit withdrawal agreement. “It should not continue like this,” he tweeted. “We have important things to do.

I will take any of the four; whatever they offer me, I have no doubt about their safety and that they will help reopen the country.

Why I think that mRNA is better than vector, you may ask. Well, the body builds up immunity against the vector unnecessarily, which for one strains my body's immune response resources additionally.

These are daily rates so the effect is exponential over time. There are other studies that show similar effects across a large number of jurisdictions over longer periods of time, so there is no need to look at Texas at this particular time point to learn about the mask mandate effect, it is pretty well-known.

Given the rate cases have been dropping in the US, if that holds up, removing the mask mandate would not be enough to make cases grow and spike in Texas. If cases are dropping at 2+% per day, even at it's maximum, the mask mandate effect of -1.8% is not enough to cancel that. So, a spike is not expected based on mask mandate removal. What is expected is that the drop would slow in Texas. Whether that's acceptable in other places will depend on current strain on health care system and other local context issues.

What federal authorities are worried about is the growth in share of variants. If that causes cases level off across the US, removal of the mask mandate could push the growth into positive, especially over time. Even then, the daily effect of the mask mandate is small enough that it takes time to grow into a spike, and given we have good estimates about what the mask mandates do, there is no need for states to wait to see if a spike happens in Texas around mid-April.

The problem with PA is they went from healthcare workers to 65+ and young 'high risk' people with zero proof of being high risk.

Add in how difficult some sites are to secure an appt\* and it has been open season for younger people while older people who aren't technologically adept struggle.

Would have been way better to open it to 65+ for a few weeks, then add some of the more very high-risk conditions w/doctor's note (can even be doctor's send out form letter to all their high risk patients), then add the other conditions + frontline workers.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;*The report estimated that the rally generated about $12.2 billion in public health costs, which is based on the statistical cost of a COVID-19 case.*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;THERE IS ""STRONG evidence"" that a motorcycle rally in Sturgis, South Dakota, that drew hundreds of thousands of people could have been a coronavirus superspreader event, according to a recent report.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Over 400,000 motorcycle enthusiasts gathered for the annual rally from Aug. 7-16, and it was reported that social distancing and mask wearing at some of the events was not observed.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The rally was officially linked to hundreds of coronavirus cases across more than 10 states and at least one death. But the study that relied on cell phone data to track movements estimates that over 250,000 reported coronavirus cases from August 2 to September 2 are due to the rally – nearly 20% of the national cases during that time period, according to Andrew Friedson, one of the authors of the report.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Counties with the highest numbers of rally attendees had roughly a 7-12% increase in cases when compared to counties without rally goers, according to the report from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics, an independent economic research group.[[1]](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2020-09-08/sturgis-motorcycle-rally-may-have-caused-over-250-000-coronavirus-cases-report)",,,1615373724,{},gqfm8u5,False,t3_m1uqie,False,True,t1_gqfl9ae,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m1uqie/around_300000_people_are_expected_at_a_florida/gqfm8u5/,1615373735,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,birdstyx,,,[],,,,text,t2_4ensqfy1,False,False,[],"Some anecdotal advice that may help others in states that are still only giving the vaccine to specific groups of people:

I am currently living in TX in a major city where even the eligible are having a nearly impossible time getting their well deserved doses, (whether it be lack of availability or poor management, I am not sure) but I heard many people in my area who did not meet the requirements had gotten their first shots. While Texas reopens dining to 100% capacity and removed the mask mandate, many of my coworkers and service industry friends are left looking for any way to get the vaccine so we can safely continue to work while being left to fend for our own health and safety. 

 With a little help from a friend, my boyfriend and I were able to schedule an appointment after days of checking back on various websites for availability. Some offered waiting lists and asked how you were eligible and to provide proof upon arrival once the appointment was secured. However, once available appointments opened up (mind you, we drove 2 hours away just to get there, so this was not something we were able to get locally in our city) we were able to schedule and receive the first shot no questions asked, no proof necessary. 

I advised my mother who lives in another state (CT) to do the same; just check back every website you can find that is offering appointments and wait for something to pop up, grab the first available appointment as soon as you can. If there are available appointments, available vaccines, and no questions asked about whether or not you meet requirements upon scheduling, I don't see why they would waste their time refusing you service when that vaccine could potentially go unused for no reason. 

Obviously some places will be more strict on following guidelines, only giving the vaccine to those who meet requirements, etc. But it is not completely impossible for others to find a way to get in line as well. So, fellow service industry, grocery store employees, ""essential"" workers who have been put on the front lines to keep our country running while making our ever stagnant minimum wages, don't stop *looking* for an appointment; at least there is a chance of finding one that will allow you to get the shot regardless of age or health or profession. An available vaccine is an available vaccine, and is best *used* rather than wasted because not enough eligible parties had been scheduled for those spots.",,,1615398085,{},gqgxns1,False,t3_m1wlpl,False,False,t1_gqfwc8w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m1wlpl/alaska_makes_vaccines_available_to_those_16_and/gqgxns1/,1615401269,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This is really just how viruses work. Basically, they spread more easily and become less deadly. That's because a virus that kills its host can't reproduce, so it dies off. Add in immunity acquired either through infection or vaccine, and the effects are even more muted.

The only reasonable risk-mitigation strategy here is avoiding superspreader events altogether.

This is a myth that was created by the fact the interim results of trials didn't *have* enough COVID cases in the vaccine arm (good!) to meaningfully determine the percentage that would end up in hospital or a grave.

Of course, they are still very effective, but making this kind of flawed argument isn't helping anyone, especially every time there is a new ""oh no, outbreak in a nursing home, including people who were vaccinated!"" headline (there was one just now). If you make people think the vaccine is 100% effective against hospitalization and death, then they'll think it has stopped working. Not a great idea.

Let's take a *big* study, now that we have data from actual populations that have taken the vaccine... [The study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2101765) is from Israel, the country that has vaccinated the highest percentage of its population (mostly if not fully with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine), and published in the New England Journal of Medicine:

&gt; In the follow-up period starting 7 days after the second dose, the vaccine effectiveness for documented infections, symptomatic illness, hospitalization, and severe disease was 92% (95% CI, 88 to 95), 94% (95% CI, 87 to 98), 87% (95% CI, 55 to 100), and 92% (95% CI, 75 to 100), respectively.

The follow-up after 7 days from the second dose is considered the ""final"" one. You can see that while those are good, high values, they are not 100%. It means people who got the vaccine have died, and people have been hospitalized. Seldom is anything ""100%"".

Otherwise, people like you, who are far too jumpy to toss their masks and stop washing hands and pretend like life has gone back to normal for lack of patience will keep this shit spreading and we will have to stay in quarantine and mask usage even longer, because, as it turns out, you dont have to actually *contract* the virus to spread it, all you have to do is shake two peoples hands, it's not rocket science, despite what a lot of people try to make it out as.",,,1615384834,{},gqg21j6,False,t3_m1r1f2,False,True,t1_gqg11kv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m1r1f2/infection_risk_remains_even_after_vaccination/gqg21j6/,1615384844,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The issues you are describing were gone by late January. You're talking about December/early Jan stuff.

We had a rolling 7 day average of 942k on Jan 21st.  We were right there at the edge of 1M.

Disney's fiscal year ends in September.  So while the company was growing in revenue (55B, 59B, 69B) and then dropped to 65B for 2020, almost half a year of that 65B was pre-pandemic, and the impact of the pandemic will be much more apparent on 2021 fiscal reporting.

Net Income  went from 11B in 2019 to -2.8B in 2020, again though the bigger impact from the pandemic will be in 2021 reporting.

Disney is a big corporation, but also has 59B in debt.  Its new subscription service and its future theater release revenue is highly dependent on production which has been shut down on some projects as well as delayed or made far more expensive on others.

Now certainly, none of this is to suggest that Disney couldn't finance 1B-2B more than the losses they're already expecting in order to pay employees that aren't working, but... isn't this what unemployment insurance is for?

Is this the expectation for all employers?  If Disney but not others, what's the criteria for determining when an employer should pay employees when there's no work for them to do?

So far, all that is being said is that there's a Phase 4 Trial that needs to be conducted to gain progress towards a FDA Approval. I asked for details about it and if there's anything else and there was no follow up to that.

Maybe by the time I'm eligible (I'm in the low risk pool), a vaccine will be FDA approved and I don't have to worry about it. That's what's I am hoping for, but I believe that won't be the case.

&gt;  
&gt;The Interior Health Authority said two staff members and 10 residents have tested positive for COVID-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;Contact tracing is underway and additional infection control  and prevention measures have been implemented at the facility to curb  the spread of the virus, Interior Health said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cottonwood Care Centre is a long-term care facility operated by Interior Health. It has 221 publicly funded long-term care beds.  
&gt;  
&gt;**As of Feb. 15, 82 per cent of residents at the facility had received  their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, or 220 of its 268 residents,  according to** [**data provided by the BC Centre of Disease Control (BCCDC).**](http://www.bccdc.ca/Health-Info-Site/PublishingImages/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/data/LTC-vaccine-coverage-by-Facility.pdf)  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Sue Pollock, an Interior Health medical health officer, said  Cottonwood Care Centre was one of the first long-term care facilities to  be offered the vaccine in December.  
&gt;  
&gt;Vaccination clinics were held at the facility, once in January and  once in February, and staff can also access a vaccine at the community  health clinic.  
&gt;  
&gt;In late January, B.C. health officials announced  that COVID-19 vaccines had been delivered in all long-term care homes in  British Columbia.  
&gt;  
&gt;Residents and staff at long-term care homes were the first to be vaccinated, and that program has been completed.  
&gt;  
&gt;**One week ago,** [**B.C. health officials announced that the gap**](https://globalnews.ca/news/7670004/bc-covid-19-vaccine-first-dose-july/) **between the first and second doses of the vaccine will be extended to 112 days.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Pfizer,  one of the manufacturers, has recommended a 21-day gap between doses  and the province previously was spacing them out by 42 days.**

Are you presenting a conspiracy theory about the determination to use 21 days?

Pfizer used scientific data collected from attempts to create a vaccine against SARS and MERS.

A single dose trial was attempted and run for 2 years.

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166354216304016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166354216304016)

There has existed an mRNA vaccine against MERS since 2017. Its confidence interval (CI) was just too unreliable.

Triple dose mRNA vaccine trials were being run in the US three years before the pandemic.

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30266-X/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30266-X/fulltext)

Only the pandemic provided serological insight into the need for the second dose to be administered before the ramp-up of the immune system to avoid the primed immune system from rejecting the vaccine.

After 21 days, the human immune system starts to ramp up and beyond 28 days the efficacy of a single dose is pretty solid.

You see, in 18 years of attempting to create a vaccine against SARS and  MERS, what we learned is immunity and cross-immunity is our greatest obstacle.

If a single-dose was provided to a candidate who had some form of immunity already from a recent cold, the vaccine produced zero reaction.

That window of opportunity for the second dose is short.  If the second dose is not done to the manufacturer's recommendations, it can be wasted.

Pfizer is currently attempting to determine the best window for a third dose to provide over 96% efficacy against variants.  The window for a third dose from the second dose is looking like 9 to 11 days.

All done with scientific evidence, not tinfoil hats.",,,1615335699,{},gqe4kp6,True,t3_m1k4dt,False,True,t1_gqe2w0y,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m1k4dt/covid19_outbreak_declared_at_kelowna_longterm/gqe4kp6/,1615339263,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It might help to explain how the vaccines are tested in a little more clear detail.  Vaccines are trials where they recruit a bunch of people with similar demographics (age, location, health history, etc.) and then split them into two equivalent groups.  

Group 1 gets a fake vaccine, and group 2 gets a real one.

At the end of the trial, they check to see how many people in each group got COVID.  They compare Group 1 to Group 2 to see what the difference is.

Let's say a trial recruits 30,000 people, and has 210 cases of COVID across all participants.  Of those, 200 of the cases were in Group 1 and 10 of the cases were in Group 2.

Because all the people were recruited the same way and randomly divided up, we'd expect roughly the same number to be exposed to COVID in both groups.  So if the vaccine didn't work at all, we would have expected another 200 cases in Group 2.  Instead, we saw only 10.  Looks like the vaccine is helping!

Because the vaccine has prevented 190 of the 200 cases we were expecting to see, we can say it showed 95% efficacy.

It's just as useful to look at what this doesn't tell us.  It doesn't tell us anything about your chances of catching COVID overall, and it doesn't tell us anything about masks/social distancing/etc.  What it says is that once you were going to get COVID anyway, for whatever reason, the vaccine had a 95% chance of stopping that from happening.

So if you have a 72% efficacy vaccine like J&amp;J, it means that out of 100 times you were already going to get a moderate case of COVID-19 because the rest of your defenses had failed, 72 of them will be prevented.",,,1615351966,{},gqexhy0,False,t3_m1ada1,False,True,t1_gqenxyq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m1ada1/take_whatever_covid_vaccine_you_can_get_all_of/gqexhy0/,1615352759,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

So our framing was fucked from the start and largely to blame for the shitshow.  
  
But also I just wish our vaccine people focused on transmission more than symptoms.

I'm glad you brought this up because hardly anyone mentions a resoundingly horrifying consideration about this: no, we have not been here before.  
 
When you had outbreaks in ancient civilizations, people could develop herd immunity (after such pains) because the populations were relatively minuscule back then. A city *and region* in ancient Greece at it's peak might host a few hundred thousand people. Now the metropolitan area of Athens alone has nearly 4 million people.  
Mutations happen as a percentage, i.e. maybe 1 out of 10,000 replications results in a new mutation (it's an example number, I don't know what the actual rate of mutation is on average). So in the region surrounding Athens (Attica), of the maybe 300,000 people, you'd be dealing with 30 mutations. And of course most mutations are harmless, like a person developing heterochromia (eyes with separate colors). So you'd say maybe 1 in 500 mutations actually make the virus more virulent or dangerous. Meaning an outbreak in ancient Attica was unlikely to produce a mutation that changed the game.  
  
Now of course our cities alone are so large that each urban region can host it's own mutations. But *worse* we live in an interconnected world with airplanes and ships where we effectively have one large region known as Earth. Where one virus can spread to every corner within weeks and months. As it did just one year ago.  
  
That means that we're going to see more mutations than we've **ever seen in human history**. It doesn't help that the coronavirus is particularly known for mutating. If these mutations keep popping up and developing features like more infectivity or vaccine resistancy, this virus **doesn't go away**. This is why public health officials are urging us to not only vaccinate and slow the spread in our own countries, but to get the rest of the world vaccinated ASAP too - for our own good.  
Even if everyone in the United States was vaccinated sufficiently against the current strains, if the virus is rampant in Malawi and breeds a strain that happens to be resistant to our vaccine, it's going to reset all of our efforts.  
  
We've got almost 8 billion people on this planet now. And projections expect it's going to take us several *years* of concerted effort and loads of money to get the world vaccinated. That means we're going to see new mutations pop up over and over. **Unlike anything we've ever seen in human history**. Natural herd immunity does not work here. Just look at Brazil and what P1 is doing to them.",,,1615351667,{},gqex21e,False,t3_m11jgz,False,True,t1_gqbrzph,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m11jgz/new_outbreak_of_covid19_in_bc_care_home_where/gqex21e/,1615352562,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That's not a rule. 4 weeks is when the efficacy after the first shot is plateuing. Pfizer data from Israel showed that. In any case, that's data we have, but as a general rule, it usually doesn't take more than 4 weeks for efficacy to approach its peak. That's definitely the impression that these viral vector vaccine publications give.

&gt;The 2-dose trial is also spacing out the shots 8 weeks, not 12 weeks. 

Didn't know that. I read somewhere that it was 12 weeks. Okay. They're still postponing the second dose and you only see that with viral vector vaccines.

&gt;giving a 2nd dose too early for the Oxford vaccine actually LOWERED efficacy (55%

That's actually really weird. AZ's results amd cohorts were broken by too many variables for any of them to be statistically significant enough. 

Given the results from AZ, where the second dose even after 12 weeks barely had any effect (76-&gt;81%), it's only right to *assume* or *expect* that the second dose of the JnJ one won't have much effect. Maybe even the reason they opted for a one dose regimen to begin with. After all, Sputnik V is being praised for its design for a reason.

And, no the right to liberty is not less important than the right to protest nor go to church. It is a fundamental right that when violated by the government, the court's view said violations under strict scrutiny.  Thus, when a court finds that a law infringes a fundamental constitutional right, it may apply the strict scrutiny standard to nevertheless hold the law or policy constitutionally valid if the government can demonstrate in court that the law or regulation is necessary to achieve a ""compelling state interest"". The government must also demonstrate that the law is ""narrowly tailored"" to achieve the compelling purpose, and uses the ""least restrictive means"" to achieve the purpose. Failure to show these conditions may result in a judge striking down a law as unconstitutional.*

As most law students know if a court uses strict scrutiny language in the decision, it almost assuredly means the court is about to strike down that law. Court's very rarely finds instances where the government has a compelling state interest and has narrow tailored the law to fit that state interest and that there is likely less restrictive means to achieve that purpose.

The EU signed the AZ contract a day before the UK did – the EU signed its APA on 27 August 2020, the UK signed its own Supply Agreement for AZD1222 on 28 August 2020. 

If you're going to argue that ""Sure, but the UK entered into negotiations earlier"" – maybe yes, maybe no. But the EU contract did not happen in a day either. And if you're going to go with ""but the UK funded AZ plants on its soil"" – yeah, sure. But AZ already had manufacturing capacity in the EU, and it's not like they are a start-up that requires funding, they're a multinational pharma company with billions of dollars in revenue – anyway, their contract with the EU pretty much says that all the doses are to be delivered at no loss to AZ, meaning that the EU was willing to cover unexpected additional costs.

If you're going to argue that the EU contract is based on ""best efforts"" – so is the UK contract. They both contain the same language.

The payment terms are redacted in the UK contract, but we know for a fact that the EU paid nearly $400 million for its doses, including 66% within the first 5 days from signing the contract to ensure stockpiling. We also know that AZ promised delivery of 80 million doses by the end of Q1, then applied late for approval, then just before the approval happened they cut down the initial delivery plan to 31 million, and they fail to deliver even that.

And yeah, the EU is a customer. AZ got money in advance for producing a vaccine to be delivered by a given date, and their ""best reasonable efforts"" clause says that they are supposed to do whatever a company their size, standing, position, and with similar assets would do in this situation. Meaning - they can buy it from SII or outsource production to deliver what they were paid for.

https://gestion.pe/peru/upch-sobre-ensayos-clinicos-de-sinopharm-la-informacion-difundida-es-preliminar-upch-coralith-garcia-nndc-noticia/

After that, Universidad Privada Cayetano Heredia, UPCH, showed results that the ""fake news"" politicians claimed, was in fact true:

And there's the bombshell that the people in charge of that study knew the low efficacy and had a third dose as early as the end of November:
https://convoca.pe/agenda-propia/vacunagate-quienes-son-las-40-personas-que-recibieron-tres-dosis-anticovid-19-fuera

Pretty much, the whole thing is corruption. Sinopharm's chinese embassador served as an agent to sell the vaccine to Peru and they hired media to prop up. Peru spent $40 per dose, while paying the peruvian gov't and people in charge of the trial to secure the contract:

Mid 70's is imaginable. 80% is as well. That's all I'm saying. 

4 weeks definitely is enough. 50 days is really excessive. JnJ opted for 4 weeks to be the read-out time for a reason. 

&gt;You can't say Pfizer plateaued at 4 weeks and apply that to J&amp;J

I cited it as an example. You stated that 4 weeks is not enough in general, not only for viral vector vaccines.

&gt;AZ lowering efficacy with the booster too early isn't weird at all. It makes total sense when you take into account vector resistance

It doesn't 😅😂. It really doesn't. Makes no immunological sense. Probably a CI thing. 

&gt;It seems like you're mixing up numbers from the initial AZ data with the recent, as well as numbers from J&amp;J and AZ.

I'm really not. 

&gt;90 days vs 28 days for J&amp;J

You're assuming that the efficacy for AZ improved in that period of time. No reason to assume that. The reason they waited 12 weeks wasn't so that the efficacy could improve, but rather to wait for the anti-ChAd immunity to subside, but even after 12 weeks it was still a major issue, obviously.

That's speculation. They are testing out a 12 week interval (within which no one in the real world will get the second dose.......).

That is very likely to happen to JnJ as well, because, just like AZ, their second dose would use the exact same vector as the first dose. We're lucky to have multiple vaccines to compare data and design. Sputnik V uses two different vectors and has efficacy of 92%. The doses are given 3 weeks apart.

I'd call that misinformation. The Executive Order doesn't say no vaccines can be exported, it says vaccines ordered by the US cannot be sold to other countries (to the highest bidder for example). This is a contractual obligation, not a ban. 

Nothing in that ED forbids, bans, or disallows Pfizer and Moderna to expand their capacities in the US and sell to other countries as long as they maintain their contractual obligations to the US. 

&gt;Would you say if the EU blocked all exports of vaccines until the EU was vacintatione wouldn't be a ban?

That's different than what the US has done. 

&gt;The way i see it is that the US is being selfish in a time when the world needs to come together as a hole to vacinate the country. If the northern us power grid was knocked off, should the Canadian provinces ban exports and make sure the other provinces have power regardless of contracts? During 9-11 Should Canada rejected all the flights blocked from landing in the US and have them all crash instead? I don't get the mentality here.

Canada has done the same exact thing you're accusing the US of with regards to vaccines, so guilt-tripping tactics won't work here. 

&gt;Canada to take COVAX vaccines, won't share doses until every Canadian is inoculated: Anand

Most countries have failed to deal with covid and if the US had a different president it would probably still not do so great. It's also not true to say that every country did equally bad and that government's or Trump's actions don't matter. There are huge differences between the countries and a lot of that comes down to the actions of the governments. The way Trump dealt (or rather didn't) with the problem is really reprehensible and certainly made the situation in US worse. The countries that did well with covid are countries that took it very seriously right from the beginning. They tested a lot, did an intensive tracing, mandated mask wearing or limited high risk activities. In contrast look at what Trump did. He said many times that it's not a problem at all and that it will just disappear. US had the luxury that the covid started spreading there later than in Asia or Europe but did not use this advantage at all. You were very slow with ramping up the testing, very slow with adapting mask wearing and overall very slow in reacting. The travel ban came at a point when it had little effect since at that point covid has been spreading a lot in US. What else has Trump done? The only reason why things did not end up much worse is the actions of state governments. 

Most European countries have also failed, although here I think the story here is a bit different. A big problem in Europe is that the countries are very interconnected, but governed separately. Since EU has very little powers in health care, the response to the pandemics has not been coordinated much across EU and each country has acted individually. This then makes it very difficult to contain the disease, although some countries have still succeeded.

Germany has in my opinion been one of the countries that dealt with the issue much better than others, but in the end they still failed to large extent. They did fare much better than US though.

# Vaccine row: EU has exported 34m doses – including 9m to the UK

 **Internal figures leaked amid tit-for-tat with Boris Johnson over claims UK had export ban in place** 

 A total of 34m doses of coronavirus vaccine have been exported from the EU despite shortages for people living in the bloc, including 9m sent to the UK and 1m to the US, which has a ban on sales abroad. 

...

But officials said Michel wanted to know how many exports had been made from the UK as they highlighted the role of EU-based production sites in the global effort.

“We know that different countries have got different measures in place – that doesn’t concern vaccines, as far as we understand, coming from the UK,” a commission spokesperson said. “But we know as well that we, the EU, are a very, very active exporter of vaccines and that this is not necessarily the case of all our partners.”

According to the latest figures seen by the Guardian and accurate as of 9 March, of the 34,090,287 doses exported from the EU to 31 countries, 9,106,162 went to the UK, 3,917,640 to Canada, 3,134,204 to Mexico, 2,720,210 to Japan and 1,368,900 to Saudi Arabia. Other beneficiaries of EU exports included Hong Kong (1.3m), Singapore (967,030), the US (953,723), Chile (942,825) and Malaysia (751,140).

The majority of vaccines exported from the EU to the UK were made by Pfizer, which distributes globally from its European production sites, it is understood. The EU has blocked only one export request under its controversial authorisation mechanism for vaccines, a shipment of 250,000 Oxford/AstraZeneca doses from Italy to Australia.

The US export ban (or inability to produce enough to export) as well as the EU's failure to also produce enough is giving both Russia and China a huge geopolitical victory. Chile (Chinese vaccine) and Serbia (SputnikV I think) are vaccinating at a much better pace than most of the EU countries. As Hungary and Slovakia are also buying SputnikV, they're also able to push ahead. This isn't great for the soft power of western nations.  
  
I don't fault Hungary and Slovakia for going outside the EU purchases to get SputnikV, both have massive outbreaks and the EU has failed to deliver on the vaccines so far.  
  
Without knowing enough, it seems to me like Russia sacrifices their citizens in order to get this win though. At what pace are they vaccinating and are they able to produce enough both for internal use and all the exports?

Isn't that what this super-spreader event is all about?  Forget about unvaccinated grandparents - what about the unvaccinated high-risk grocery store cashier?  The unvaccinated high-risk daycare worker?  There are plenty of unvaccinated high-risk folks around.  Should someone go to a rave and then infect them?

\&gt; What I *am*  saying is that people have been dealing with this for a year, and  they've lived the numbers. People have gotten this, seen others get it,  and they've determined there's more to life than just disease avoidance.  Like I said, we all make these calculations differently.

That's all fine and good, but do you have the right to make these calculations for someone else?  You've decided ""there's more to life than just disease avoidance"", go out to a super-spreader event, and then come back from it with asymptomatic COVID.  Then you go and infect the flight attendant in your airplane, who lives with a high-risk person.  You've made these calculations for the high-risk person by your action.

What really is true, scientifically (rather than psychologically) is that we are nowhere near herd immunity and there are still way too many unvaccinated folks around.  The pandemic is not over.  Nothing has changed.  I just have to SMH at the people who can't wait another couple of months until we do in fact reach herd immunity through vaccination.  
As for what is OK and what isn't - again, we are in a pandemic.  Anything that contributes to the death count is not OK.  Anything that does not is OK.

Most of us do. We should all try to have good hygiene all the time. I'm just saying there are limits to what we can control.

&gt;Now, COVID is (a) much deadlier than the flu, and (b) much more likely to spread asymptomatically. This is pretty settled science by now. So, I am much more likely to accidentally infect someone with COVID than I am to infect someone with the flu.

No arguments here.

&gt;The only reasonable risk-mitigation strategy here is avoiding superspreader events altogether. 

&gt;And why is this the ""social end"" of the pandemic? Only about 10% of the population is vaccinated, we're nowhere near herd immunity. What happened to mark this ""social end""? The fact that it's spring and everyone wants to go out and party?

This is where we have some disagreement. First off, I'm not saying someone should go to a rave and then go hang out with their unvaccinated grandparents. That's dumb, so let's get that out of the way.

What I *am* saying is that people have been dealing with this for a year, and they've lived the numbers. People have gotten this, seen others get it, and they've determined there's more to life than just disease avoidance. Like I said, we all make these calculations differently.

&gt;I'd expect this kind of reasoning from a toddler, not a grownup.

This is unnecessarily patronizing. Sure, we can make this comment about a biker rally, but what about other scenarios? Are get-togethers with groups of friends okay? What about large protests for important causes?

&gt;The perception that some vaccines may be better than others has to do with the topline numbers from efficacy studies. The mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna were both found to be about 95% effective against preventing symptomatic COVID-19 after the second dose. The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, by contrast, was found to be 66% protective against moderate and severe disease overall worldwide, and 72% protective against such cases in the U.S.

I think people say they will continue to wear masks and some will actually continue to wear masks for two reasons.

First, people have lost a lot of trust in the FDA and CDC.  The FDA has had trust problems for years, but the CDC was sacrosanct until Trump got a hold of it and the doctors in charge of it lied to people to either keep their jobs or for a political agenda.

I'm not saying the CDC never lied, withheld or skewed the truth before, but this time was exceptional in it's breadth and the harm it caused.

The second reason is people are scared.  Some of us have underlying conditions that mean we have to be more careful.  Until we are fully convinced the pandemic is actually over and there aren't variants out there that will refuel it in spite of the current vaccine, we can't afford to take any more chances than we have to.

I will be wearing a mask for quite a while.  Yes, it's inconvenient and I won't like it, but I'll do it.  In case you doubt me, I currently have not left my house for a full year except to go to the doctor and walk in an area where no one else goes.  When I do have to come in contact with another person, I wear a P100 chemical mask, which is far more uncomfortable than an surgical mask or N95 mask plus you get a number of people looking at you like you are crazy.

One day, the United Kingdom was very hungry and went to the butcher's.

There, it said ""Hello, I would like 100 million of the latest sausages please"".

""Sure"", said the butcher, ""but as these are the very latest sausages, nobody has 100 million yet. I can get you 100 million, but you'll need to pay for them as well as invest in creating a new farm to rear pigs, and a new factory to turn them in to sausages.""

But the butcher warned, ""It will take about six months before you receive your first sausages, and there could be a few hiccups along the way.""

He continued, ""However, in return for your investment I'll guarantee you get the first 100 million sausages that are produced"".

""Sounds great!"" Said the UK, who signed the contract and paid immediately. They understood that there may be delays, but had got this deal so early that there was plenty of time before the sausages would be approved for human consumption in around 8 months.

A few days later, the Inclusive Sausage Alliance ('ISA'), consisting of Italy, Germany, France, and the Netherlands, arrived at the same butcher's. They left with an offer on the same terms as the UK, but for 400 million sausages, to be shared among the whole European Union. They didn't sign right away.

After a short while passed, a very angry EU Commissioner appeared. ""How dare you negotiate sausages on the EU's behalf? You have no right!"", it screamed at the top of its lungs. ""From now on, I order the sausages around here!"".

Some more time passed. Lots of time, actually. Three whole months. That's a ridiculous amount of time.

""Hello butcher, I represent the EU Commission. Give me 400 million sausages in three months. I want mine at the same time as the UK!"", it demanded.

""W... w... well"". The butcher struggled with his words. Flabbergasted at the unreasonable demand placed before him. ""Well, as you know these are the latest sausages and it will take up to si...""

""Three months!"" barks a stroppy EU Commissioner.

""O...ok I'll do my best to get you them in three months, but realistically it will take six. I'm not guaranteeing anything. If you ordered three months ago you would have probably got them by your deadline.""

The EU signed the exact same deal it the ISA was offered three months ago, which included an agreement to fund upgrades at an existing farm and factory in Belgium.

Another three months pass. We're in the present day. Thirty percent of the UK has eaten a delicious sausage, but millions of EU citizens are starving.

""They promised us millions of sausages by now!"" scream the politicians, putting on a show for their home audience, while feigning surprise that a six month project really wasn't delivered in three. With German and French elections not far away, they don't dare to risk being seen as the cause of the failure. They can't admit they caused a three month delay. They can't bare the embarassment that Britain is one of the most fed and happy nations in the world, not after Brexit. Britain can't be allowed to succeed. It must be made an example of at every opportunity.

""Britain stole four million sausages!"", they cry!

""The British sausages we ordered are only 8% meat anyway and cause terrible diarrhoea!"", claims an unnamed German official.

""Take sausages from Britain's deliveries!"" insists the EU Commission!

""Ban the exports of bockwurst!"" demands Germany!

The reality is that if someone were to produce vaccines using a different production line in the UK they could export from the first dose, and if doses from the factories in question were to be exported there would be no legal method for the UK to prevent those doses from leaving the country.  The UK could sue for breach of contract afterwards though, and I imagine the penalties would be stiff.

[],,awoeoc,,,[],,,,text,t2_9iurf,False,False,[],"Let me start by saying I really do appreciate this discussion despite the fact we disagree on quite a few things. That said:

&gt;These types of comments and articles were buried in the media. They were met with derision and false accusations, especially on this coronavirus sub.

I agree the media is terrible at reporting and I personally try not to rely on the media to decide anything. There's the old saying about reading the news paper about the thing you're an expert in and you'll see that they have no idea. To cut down on the media I think we can simply look at the excess death rate over the past 52 weeks and see something's clearly killing a lot more people than normal [(Source)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm). The excess death count is actually higher than the covid death count. So clearly something is very wrong and people are dying in greater numbers. 

So even if someone had covid and was in a car accident and we called it a ""covid death"" we know for a fact over the past 12 months a ton of people have died. If it's not covid what is it? Did the lockdowns really kill 500,000 people and covid zero? I'm sure the lockdowns did in fact kill people but if it killed enough to affect the excess death count in this way then that would be instantly noticeable in a way the media could not hide. If Covid was a non issue it'd show in these numbers in a way the media couldn't lie about. ""Something"" is killing a lot of people and it started exactly when covid started. If it wasn't covid what is it? Secondary I know it's anecdotal but if we're not trusting the media I have to trust what I can assuredly trust and that's my friends who are nurses in several NYC hospitals. They went through hell in march. If nothing else, to me personally, I have an undeniable confidence that many many many people died in NYC due to covid who wouldn't have died. My friends saw dozens if not hundreds with their view own eyes. I've known them for over 20 years I know they're not lying. While it may not mean anything to you (after all, I'm just some guy on the internet, I could be lying), it means something to me personally. Unless covid deaths were 100% funneled only to my friends and the rest of the city/nation didn't really deal with it, I can make a leap to say what my friends saw at their hospitals was wide spread across the city, and as reported across the nation.

&gt;When my wife and I went to the doctor to discover if he needed surgery, I was prevented from going back with him because covid measures. Later this year, I will be the only one who can visit my son in the hospital after his surgery because of covid measures.

I get it it's very very hard. Almost a full year ago my father was in a serious accident, we didn't know if he would make it. This was just as the lockdowns started, getting anyone to talk to us from the hospital was very hard. He wasn't conscious for two weeks and it was basically a hell to go through. We weren't able to see him for THREE MONTHS due to a lengthy hospital stay followed by a rehab center - all closed to visits. Also due to covid several surgeries were ignored, his arm and leg will never be the same and that was preventable if the hospital staff wasn't completely inundated dealing with covid. He suffered a stroke as a result of the accident and hasn't been the same since. Absolutely shitty year.

What I don't see is how this affects the vaccine? I already think the lockdowns went too far. My friends who were nurses never caught covid, they literally wore fucking garbage bags to work due to a lack of PPE and reused ""one time use"" masks for WEEKS. And that was enough to protect them. So it's shitty my mom couldn't visit my father even though we owned serious masks with respirators and eye protection while nurses were literally finding things on the floor to use for PPE and managing to not get sick (also quite a few nurses did get sick, my friends did get lucky overall). 

But the vaccine should be spread far and wide and should be as encouraged as possible. It's how we get out of this. My family are immigrants - they all believe in all sorts of crap and many don't want the vaccine due to irrational fears (like covid came from space? Even if true wtf does that have to dow with a vaccine, but my Aunt won't take it since covid came from space). These same people will inject themselves with random stuff given by a literal witchdoctor (I wish I was joking).

&gt;Has it been held to the same rigorous evaluation of previous vaccines? No.

I mean I have a serious point here and it's that: By what mechanism could a vaccine do harm? What I mean from this is I really haven't heard of anything with as low quantity as a vaccine having a delayed effect. 

If it doesn't kill you fast, or hurt you fast, how would it have an effect 3 months later? A vaccine works by making your body create antibodies, but the vaccine itself is out of your system quickly. I'm not sure exact time but it's only days maybe 1-2 weeks before your body expels everything. What's left over are antibodies not ""vaccine"". So how could a vaccine harm you 3 months from now? We've also given the vaccines to hundreds of thousands of people and we're not seeing any issues 3 months down the line. I'm not depending on the news solely, I've sought out information on the vaccine to see possible harm it can do and I can't find anything. Only things i can find are potential immediate-effects, and maybe interactions with certain types of conditions (autoimmune disorders for example), but for a healthy person there is zero mechanism for delayed harm, and immediate harm we'd know about already due the millions of doses given. 

I think it's good to be skeptical of things, I got my first dose already and I sure as hell looked up information because I agree it seems rushed. But in my research I couldn't locate anything that said this could be harmful EXCEPT for immediate onset issues within days of taking the vaccine. Given the fact millions of others already got the vaccine before me, I felt okay knowing the only real risk is anaphylaxis - I have a deadly peanut allergy so I carry an epipen with me anyways. 

I would've hesitated to take in December, maybe even January, but by now i have confidence we'd know if it wasn't safe.",,,1615409142,{},gqhp7xp,False,t3_m0v0uf,False,True,t1_gqhenw6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m0v0uf/a_quarter_of_americans_plan_to_say_no_to_covid/gqhp7xp/,1615415225,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This is why Sputnik V uses 2 different adenoviruses, to circumvent this. This should also hopefully mean the 2 dose trial for J&amp;J shows a good increase. Not just because it'll have a booster, but because they're giving the first shot 8 weeks instead of 4.

Okay, most of what you said here makes no sense 😂. I swear to god I'm not trying to sound condenscending 😂😂 even though it probably sounds that way. Efficacy dropping after the second dose doesn't make any immunological sense. Just take my word for it haha. Your having antibodies to the vector will only help neutralize the vector from the second dose. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are not impacted at all. They cannot be. The most that anti-vector immunity can  do is make it so that anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity doesn't improve. It cannot hinder it. It's just mechanistically not possible. You just won't get additional Spike proteins in your circulation. Worst case scenario - it's as if you didn't get that second dose at all. In that scenario, anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity is not engaged in any way. 

Sputnik V then uses a different vector to prevent the vaccine from being neutralized, to allow the vector to infect our cells and to allow our cells to then produce the Spike protein. That spike protein then stimulates the anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity and intensifies proliferation of SARS-CoV-2-reactive B and T cells and ramps up germinal center reactions, allowing for prolonged immune memory and also higher affinity antibodies (more potent antibodies, not just increased number/titre).

Hopefully I explained it well.

Alaska is probably one of the more challenging states due to how remote people are, so usage statistics from first availability is probably not a very useful stat.  Likewise, regional shortages is more of a state issue than a federal one.

For Sinopharm, China’s biggest vaccine developer, coronavirus offers a shot at a future that had been out of reach.  The state-backed company is betting that the urgent need to inoculate billions of people across the world will finally allow it to establish its credentials as a global supplier.  

Its first Covid-19 vaccine was approved by Chinese authorities late last year, handing the company the lion’s share of a national immunisation programme that started in earnest in January. Its second was approved last month.  

Whether Sinopharm can use this as a springboard to roll the vaccine out beyond its vast domestic market, however, depends on a combustible mix of politics, trust and supply.  Thomas Bollyky, a senior fellow for global health, economics, and development at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, said the still-limited supply of vaccines based on the pioneering mRNA technology — used in the BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna jabs — is running in its favour. 

“I do think you’ll see many of the other regions of the world that have not secured early doses from more proven players turning to vaccines like the Sinopharm vaccine,” he said.  

A sprawling company that had revenues of more than Rmb500bn ($77.7bn) last year, Sinopharm’s operations span the development, sale and distribution of most major medicines, including traditional Chinese treatments. Its subsidiary, China National Biotec Group, has developed the vaccines. While the country’s biggest jab maker, CNBG still only accounts for a fraction of Sinopharm's revenues. 

&amp;#x200B;

# A handful of nations  

So far only a handful of nations including the UAE, Bahrain, Pakistan, Egypt, Serbia and Hungary have authorised Sinopharm’s first vaccine, which the company said had an efficacy rate of 79 per cent in phase 3 trials.  

The vaccines are made using a decades-old technique in which a virus is chemically inactivated and then injected into a patient to prime their immune system. The second uses a slightly different strain of the virus.  

According to Chinese state media, countries had placed orders for at least 140m doses of the two by the middle of January, far shy of the total for the likes of Oxford/AstraZeneca. However, if Sinopharm grows its order book substantially, it would vindicate Beijing’s ambition to develop state-backed companies with globally competitive technology.  

The reputation of Yang Xiaoming would also be burnished. The chairman of Sinopharm’s vaccine business since 2015, Yang is one of the public faces of China’s Covid-19 research. A doctor and immunologist, he spent five years in the late 1990s at the US National Institutes of Health and previously led national projects to develop rotavirus and Sars vaccines.  

The pandemic offers Sinopharm its best chance in decades to prise open the global market. The group’s efforts to do so date back to when Deng Xiaoping was in power.  

Sinopharm’s vaccine business was founded in 1989 to house a string of research institutes dotted across China. Its international ambitions reached a milestone in 2013 after the World Health Organization approved its jab for Japanese Encephalitis. 

Sinopharm holds a controlling stake in six publicly traded entities — two listed in Hong Kong, including Sinopharm Holdings, and four on the Chinese mainland.  

Despite limited uptake so far outside China, Sinopharm has wasted little time in expanding its ability to manufacture the Covid-19 vaccines. The company, which employs more than 150,000 people, expects to be able to produce 1bn doses this year, after investing Rmb2bn. 

&amp;#x200B;

# A question of trust  

But for the vaccine to become a serious contender on the international stage, scientists said Sinopharm needs to make a fundamental change: stop relying on Beijing to give its jabs credibility and instead be transparent about the trials and the data they generated. 

“It will be heavy lifting for \[Sinopharm\] to establish its brand and reputation overseas,” said Jin Dong-Yan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong. “It’s a question of trust, especially as China is starting from nothing, having never before exported vaccines.”  

Jin said Sinopharm should release an explanation of the efficacy rate while also sharing comprehensive data with international regulators as quickly as possible.  

Doing so would mark a radical departure for a company that remains the supplier of choice for China’s state-subsidised vaccination programmes. It is controlled by the Assets Supervision and Administration Commission which sits under the State Council, China’s cabinet.  Sinopharm directed requests to comment to the Communist party, which did not respond. 

With governments jostling for a finite supply of vaccines, the race to inoculate billions is a bruising and highly political one. Beijing has made little secret that Sinopharm’s jab doubles up as a foreign policy tool.  

In February, Sinopharm’s deliveries, some donated by Beijing, included 500,000 for Pakistan, 600,000 for Cambodia and 300,000 each for Peru and Laos. Late last month, Hungary became the first EU nation to start using the vaccine, with prime minister Viktor Orban declaring it was his preferred choice.  

That Sinopharm has been embraced by the likes of Hungary is stirring concern in Europe for those who see it “as a geopolitical contest”, said Anthony Dworkin, a senior research fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Others say we’re short of vaccines and any vaccine that is legitimate we should be interested in.”  

But with most western nations steering clear of its vaccines, Sinopharm’s best hope of adding to its list of buyers lies in Asia and Africa. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Covax hope  

The company in January submitted an application for one of its vaccines to be included in the WHO’s Covax scheme, which aims to ensure populations of low-income countries are inoculated by combining procurement efforts.  

China’s pledge of 10m jabs to Covax is a fraction of the 2bn doses the initiative, which has struggled to secure support from wealthy nations, hopes to distribute in 2021. Covax has signed deals with BioNTech/Pfizer, Oxford/AstraZeneca, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Novavax and Sanofi.  

The bulk of Sinopharm’s overseas orders have been negotiated directly with countries in the developing world, where its vaccines face intense competition from the likes of Russia’s Sputnik V and Oxford/AstraZeneca. 

Establishing its vaccines outside China would be a much-needed win for Sinopharm, whose domestic grip is under threat from privately owned competitors. The company only makes a quarter of vaccines in the private market, which accounted for 47 per cent of total sales in 2020, up from 23 per cent in 2013, according to the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control.  

The same rivals are also eating into Sinopharm’s lead on a Covid-19 vaccine. Last month, Sinovac’s two-shot vaccine received conditional approval in mainland China and emergency approval in Hong Kong. CanSino was granted conditional approval in China last month after interim phase 3 results put the efficacy of its jab at just over 65 per cent.  

Like Sinopharm, neither company has released detailed data from their trials. That absence is no deterrent to some. 

G42 Healthcare, Sinopharm’s distributor for the Middle East and north Africa, said the Chinese company had a record for developing inactivated vaccines and met requirements for timing and delivery to the UAE. 

Securing overseas orders, however, is merely the start for Sinopharm. The company needs to produce and deliver the jab — a process that has proved fraught for most pharma groups. 

It has been lauded in Pakistan for delivering 500,000 vaccines without charge, but senior government officials told the Financial Times that the number of jabs from Sinopharm actually administered is modest compared with rivals.  

“The bulk of the vaccines I think will come from other sources” such as Oxford/AstraZeneca and Russia’s Sputnik V, said one Pakistani official.  

And although Sinopharm has increased its production capacity, and vaccines from Sinovac and CanSino have also been approved, the rollout of its jab at home has lagged behind targets set by Beijing. If that persists, achieving its international ambitions is likely to become even harder.",,,1615388789,{},gqga63z,True,t3_m1zbag,False,False,t3_m1zbag,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m1zbag/sinopharm_faces_battle_to_turn_covid_vaccine_into/gqga63z/,1615389066,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The fact that 200 million have avoided catching it up until now, is a huge win.  It wasn’t “lucky” or by accident, it’s directly because of the mask mandates and staying home.

If we allow 200m to catch it now, that’s more than double who’ve had it here since the beginning that will cause a true second wave much worse than everything we’ve been through in 2020 and 2021 so far.

&gt; But once the at risk are vaccinated the low risk can safely get infected 

That’s wrong.  Low risk can still suffer severe disease.  It’s unpredictable who the virus will effect and who it won’t.  There would still be enough folks getting severely sick to overload hospitals, worse than what we saw at the peak of things this last winter.

Yes, we’re going to reopen, and yes everything is going to go back to normal, but we **must** wait until herd immunity.

So, Bertoletti’s team set out to gain a better understanding of T cell immunity against the novel coronavirus.

The researchers gathered blood samples from 36 people who’d recently recovered from mild to severe COVID-19. They focused their attention on T cells (including CD4 helper and CD8 cytotoxic, both of which can function as memory T cells). They identified T cells that respond to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, which is a structural protein inside the virus. They also detected T cell responses to two non-structural proteins that SARS-CoV-2 needs to make additional copies of its genome and spread. The team found that all those recently recovered from COVID-19 produced T cells that recognize multiple parts of SARS-CoV-2.

Next, they looked at blood samples from 23 people who’d survived SARS. Their studies showed that those individuals still had lasting memory T cells today, 17 years after the outbreak.

We haven't had solid data about that yet. For instance, in some of the trials, the control groups ALSO didn't have any deaths.

&gt;The two vaccine trials that did explicitly report hospitalizations as an efficacy outcome make this latter issue very clear. For the [AstraZeneca](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf) vaccine, one person in the control group had severe COVID-19, but eight people were hospitalized; for [Johnson &amp; Johnson](https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download), 34 people in the placebo group had severe COVID-19, but only five people were hospitalized. It’s true that zero vaccinated people were hospitalized in either study after the vaccines took effect. But with numbers that small, you can’t draw a reliable conclusion about how high efficacy may be for these outcomes.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
As Diana Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research [pointed out](https://www.center4research.org/testimony-of-dr-diana-zuckerman-of-nchr-before-the-fda-advisory-committee-on-j-j-covid-vaccine/) about the Johnson &amp; Johnson trial, “It’s misleading to tell the public that nobody who was vaccinated was hospitalized unless you also tell them that only 5 people in the placebo group were hospitalized.” She’s right. And you can’t be confident about predicting effectiveness precisely in a wider population outside the trial, either. For example, some of the vaccine trials included relatively few people older than 60 as participants.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
You can see how fragile these numbers are by looking at those compiled for severe disease. In the [Pfizer trial](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download), for example, just one vaccinated person developed severe COVID-19 versus three in the placebo group—**which meant that a single bout of disease made the difference between a calculated efficacy rate of 66 percent and one of 100 percent.** For the [Novavax](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3) and [Oxford-AstraZeneca](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf) trials, there were zero people with severe disease in the vaccinated group versus only one in the control group, so adding or subtracting one would have been even more dramatic. T**he problem is even greater for deaths. For that efficacy analysis, only two of the vaccine trials—for Moderna’s and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s—reported any COVID-19 deaths at all in the control groups.**",,,1615384577,{},gqg1kcj,False,t3_m1ada1,False,True,t1_gqd79bi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m1ada1/take_whatever_covid_vaccine_you_can_get_all_of/gqg1kcj/,1615384589,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

https://jocogov.org/covid-19-vaccine/who-is-getting-vaccinated-now is updated weekly with who within our current tier is being focused on.

Overall we're at 16% of Kansans vaccinated. In comparison, Missouri is right at 16% too (bit higher I think) with a much higher population. Since vaccine numbers are by population, this is pretty good especially given we are all pretty spread out.

As for the lack of moving through tiers, I know some areas are ready to go, and it's a tough decision but I understand why they don't want certain areas to move forward. In Missouri, people are chasing down vaccines in rural areas meant for the local population.

That being said, it seems like Missouri has had more politically based vaccine distribution with Parsons sending more to rural areas. Even Mayor Q called for FEMA to step in and make sure it's equitable. So maybe using them as a bellwether isn't the best idea.

One study suggested something on the order of 75% efficacy at around two weeks after the first shot, which would be on the same order of protection that you would get from a single J&amp;J dose. The original Moderna trial also showed vaccine recipients over 90% less likely to be infected than the control group between two weeks after the first dose and receiving the second dose. However, I would take this with a grain of salt - the sample sizes are *really* small here and the data gathering wasn't necessarily as rigorous as the post-second-dose Moderna trial that resulted in approval, so all I would personally take from this is ""it probably provides very good protection but we're not sure *exactly* how much or how long"".

&gt;Should I be concerned that I didn't have any reaction to the shot?

No. Lots of people do not have side effects, especially after the first shot.

&gt;Related to question 2: I've been taking ivermectin weekly since November, including a few hours after I was vaccinated (I took it because I was in the company of several dozen people at the vaccination site, with decent distancing *most* of the time but no noticeable ventilation).

You probably shouldn't be taking invermectin unless a doctor recommended it.

&gt;Would a serologic test reveal whether the vaccine has had an effect?

Serology test is [not a reliable way](https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/variants-vaccines-and-what-they-mean-for-covid19-testing.html) to tell if the vaccine is protective (""People who have been vaccinated may be interested in getting a serology test, to see if the vaccine “worked,” but a vaccinated person is very likely to get a negative result from a serology test, even if the vaccine was successful and protective."") so will not provide much value to you.",,,1615404828,{},gqhf3po,False,t3_m1sj8m,False,True,t1_gqhbltg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m1sj8m/daily_discussion_thread_march_10_2021/gqhf3po/,1615409970,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Read this article and notice the extreme attention it is paying to ensure people understand the deaths may not be attributed to the vaccine though they did have the vaccine.

The media has gone through hoops to ensure the vaccine is safe, to the point of obfuscating science and reports otherwise. I'm not saying it is unsafe, however it leads to conspiracies to form when you unabashedly hide the details of a Florida doctor who died after getting the vaccine.

Yet listed as covid and published in the paper. Where was the care to ensure the public knew they might not be attributed to covid. 

The circles I'm in noticed these types of stories. It led to conversations and jokes (gallows humor) that they died ""with covid"" and not ""caused by covid"".

The article I linked above with the details of people showing to emergency rooms with significant and late diagnosed problems is not new. These types of reports have been circulating since June of last year. In April of last year, when the pandemic was in full panic mode and everyone was staying home to keep hospitals safe, it was [reported that hospitals were furloughing staff](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/49-hospitals-furloughing-workers-in-response-to-covid-19.html). 

These types of comments and articles were buried in the media. They were met with derision and false accusations, especially on this coronavirus sub.

To be completely clear, I've worn my mask. I am working from home when possible. And all my friends live across country so I socially distance them with online games. However, when my grandfather was sick and died last year, I was prevented from seeing him due to covid measures. When my wife and I went to the doctor to discover if he needed surgery, I was prevented from going back with him because covid measures. Later this year, I will be the only one who can visit my son in the hospital after his surgery because of covid measures. 

So, you see, at this stage of the game, I don't believe the media. They only care about ratings and fear porn does that. This sub is all in on the fear porn. Only promote the negativity and obfuscate any news otherwise.

Will a vaccine bring an end to this? Hopefully. However, articles and comments like what started this whole discussion are not too that end. They are trying to demonize those who wish to not get vaccinated. I have more vaccines in my system then you do most likely. Happens when you serve in the US Military. My children are inoculated to polio, measles, and mumps, etc. I have no concerns with vaccines like polio that were created many years ago, have proven safe, and the creator forfeited the patent for the betterment of all. I do however have a problem with pharmaceutical companies who face no liability and tons of profit pushing one out this fast. 

At the end of the day, we need facts presented in fair and equitable means and we need to let people make their own responsible choices.

AZ lowering efficacy with the booster too early isn't weird at all. It makes total sense when you take into account vector resistance. This is why I say J&amp;J set their endpoint too early. Keep in mind, the numbers you're using for AZ are from new data. It seems like you're mixing up numbers from the initial AZ data with the recent, as well as numbers from J&amp;J and AZ. One dose of AZ didn't reach 70+% until about 90 days after inoculation. 90 days vs 28 days for J&amp;J. Not at all comparable.

Leaving efficacies at the door (because they are irrelevant to the point I'm making), you're not ""fully vaccinated"" with a single dose of Moderna so all guidelines and regulations regarding what ""fully vaccinated"" people can do are not applicable to you.

If they roll out vaccine passports three months from now and you're sporting a single Moderna shot for whatever reason, you're not getting on that plane unless the FDA approves a single dose regimen, which is unlikely as Moderna hasn't applied for it as far as I am aware.

I'd argue that since you have the ability to ""have fun"" or pursue happiness without gathering in large groups, that unalienable right isn't being infringed, especially in the context of a global pandemic.

Yes, everything is assumption until we have the data. You seem to be misreading what I'm saying. Let me be as specific as I can

1. IMO, J&amp;J tested efficacy prematurely. We actually saw efficacy against the variants increase between the time on phase 3 results and FDA approval. So even since then, we've already seen an increase in efficacy with more time given.

2. The Oxford vax losing efficacy when given the booster prematurely DOES make sense, given the effect of vector resistance. This is why Sputnik V uses 2 different adenoviruses, to circumvent this.

Your follow up comment states the vaccine should stop old people from collapsing and other comments suggest you think she was tested for covid after being administrated to the hospital. This is proof your entire argument is based on the title and you've not actually read the article as she was diagnosed with covid 6 days after the collapse which you'd know if you read the first paragraph of the article.   


It never states what the cause of collapse is so any comment you have on that is your opinion and not based in anything factual. It could of been covid related, it might not have been. We don't know as it's not stated. So the idea that the vaccine should of stopped this is just speculation based on nothing. So your second point is also mute.

ChAdOx1 (Oxford/Astrazeneca) may not be so great against the SA variant, and we have a lot to learn here.  Novavax's vaccine also may have issues with the SA variant, though it doesn't seem that they're as big as with ChAdOx1. [This was encouraging,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmp5doo/) regarding the efficacy of vaccines against variants.

Pfizer [seems fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lf7uph/neutralization_of_viruses_with_european_south/) against the troubling variants, at least in the lab. At the very least, the mRNA vaccines [*still* work](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfp89k/neutralization_of_sarscov2_spike_6970_deletion/) on the three most worrying variants.

Most variants aren't great at being viruses.  Some, including [that one mink variant,](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/19/danish-covid-mink-variant-very-likely-extinct-but-controversial-cull-continues) have already gone extinct. I think there are other Mink variants that have made it into wild Mink populations, but that doesn't mean that it's definitely going to stay in Mink forever (it might, though).

Antibodies from recovered people who then got an mRNA vaccine [work on variants *and* OG SARS?!](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfiypu/antibodies_elicited_by_sarscov2_infection_and/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) This should really put the variant fear behind us.

**Vaccines Seem to Reduce Spread**

Vaccination and previous infection[ reduce viral load, which reduces spread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s).

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) * article does a good job of explaining the likelihood of vaccines *at least* reducing spread.  [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lf744r/daily_discussion_thread_february_08_2021/gml0gyi/) may help if that article is too much. 

[""Moderna vaccine blocks &gt;90% (87-93%) of infections &amp; 91% (89-94%) of transmission.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmqfk4q/)

Milder cases, especially asymptomatic cases [are worse at spreading](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kcy2e0/weekly_question_thread_week_of_december_14/gg8tp7n/).  

[Pfizer's vaccine may prevent spread and disease.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/loljxz/effectiveness_results_of_the_pfizer_covid19/) Looks like the amount of virus in people who've gotten one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and then infected is [greatly reduced compared to those not vaccinated](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfiqma/decreased_sarscov2_viral_load_following/).  This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a great reduction in ability to spread the virus. [Maybe even with just one dose!](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242) 

Reinfections are rare, some studies show [less than 1 in 1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kyj0bx/sarscov2_reinfection_in_a_cohort_of_43000/) (maybe in the 1 in 10,000 range, you'll have to read the study, it's awesome).

Any answer you get that is either ""yes"" or ""no"" is wrong, for now. We have only ""maybe, probably not"", and it's going to be that way for a long time.

Challenge studies with monkeys and the results look [*really good.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03041-6) They show strong immunity, or [sterilizing immunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/la4fud/immunogenic_bnt162b_vaccines_protect_rhesus/) from multiple vaccine types.  We're still figuring out if and how much sterilizing immunity can be expected from the current vaccines, though it's starting to look really good.

Also, you'll notice that any reputable person talking about this subject always says ""may be able to spread"", or ""maybe"", or ""we don't know if"". And that's because there is a small chance that vaccinated people will be able to spread the virus. But it's not a big chance. Doctors, scientists, and regulators are being very careful with their language on this subject, some would argue they're being too careful. That said, if they were to say that ""vaccinated people cannot spread the virus"", and then we find out that in some situations that vaccinated people have spread the virus, [that would end up worse for them than if they hedge for a while.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/los8r9/daily_discussion_thread_february_21_2021/goa8cu0/) So at least to me, the way they're framing it seems pretty reasonable, you just have to put yourself in their shoes.

That said, they seem to be [saying what I've been saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s). 

**Additional Thoughts/Cool Stuff**

Testing and the Positivity Rate: It's been said a lot in other subs that the positivity rate should go up over time as more people are vaccinated and don't require testing. Last year, it was *the* metric to watch, but it will likely wane quickly in importance as overall testing drops.  Don't necessarily worry about sudden high positivity rates, as mass testing will likely drop off pretty quickly, particularly as testing sites are converted to vaccination sites. 

We may want to use our newly found testing and sequencing capacity to test and sequence a higher proportion of flu samples.  This might give us a head start on which flu genetics are circulating, and help eliminate a flu or two.  We're in the single digits of flu cases most places, which is awesome!  

[Vaccines](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-much-will-it-cost-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine#:~:text=The%20cost%20for%20each%20dose,to%20cost%20%2419.50%20a%20dose.) are likely cheaper than [tests.](https://www.advisory.com/en/daily-briefing/2020/06/17/covid-test-cost#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20New%20York,as%20%24100%20or%20less)

The problem is that you have to wait longer for the second dose, and therefore, full protection. [CDC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lbiqne/daily_discussion_thread_february_03_2021/glvp1nl?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) says there is no maximum interval between doses, but [Pfizer says not more than 6 weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/liakcb/covid19_vaccine_doses_shouldnt_be_more_than_six/).

Just because [mRNA vaccines aren't 100% effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/)  against the SA variant, *doesn't* [mean that we'll definitely need boosters](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gmu581s/).

I like [thegracefuldork's prediction about vaccine availability](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lcatpp/daily_discussion_thread_february_04_2021/gm0bwc8/) more than my own previous prediction.  Not because it's ""rosier"", but because it's just better.

**Which vaccine should I get?**

When someone asks me what my favorite beer is, the answer is always the same.

It's the one in front of me.

So get the first vaccine you can, the differences are pretty minor.


[**Conclusions**](https://gfycat.com/cleantalkativedassie)

Okay, so the vaccines reduce infections, and if someone gets an infection after getting vaccinated, they have fewer and reduced symptoms.  This currently seems to also be true with post vaccination infection with any of the known variants. We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with mild symptoms spread only slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well. 

In other words: A reduction in symptoms is at least correlated with a reduction in the ability to spread the virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections and symptoms in those who do get infected. Therefore, vaccines should reduce spread.

[When You’ve Been Fully Vaccinated | CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html) 

&gt;What’s Changed  
&gt;  
&gt;If you’ve been fully vaccinated:  
&gt;  
&gt;You can gather indoors with fully vaccinated people without wearing a mask.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can gather indoors with unvaccinated people from one other household (for example, visiting with relatives who all live together) without masks, unless **any** of **those people** **or anyone they live with** has an [increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html).  
&gt;  
&gt;If you’ve been around someone who has COVID-19, you do not need to stay away from others or get tested unless you have symptoms.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, if you live in a group setting (like a correctional or detention facility or group home) and are around someone who has COVID-19, you should still stay away from others for 14 days and get tested, even if you don’t have symptoms.

So again, I'm not an expert and I don't know the answer for sure, but I think the CDC is saying:

1. Your fully vaccinated husband can visit with fully vaccinated people, without precautions.
2. Your fully vaccinated husband can't visit with a single unvaccinated household with low risk members without precautions, because he lives with you, and you are not low risk (pregnancy).

So the UK for once thinks ahead to this likely outcome, pays a private company to setup vaccine production facilities and gets it in writing that the first 100m that go out of those facilities goes to the UK. The UK in all of this have not stopped pharma companies setting up production facilities in the UK, no export bans have been made (we even ship out some components for Pfizers vaccine to the EU) we are just getting what is contractually obligated to us from a private company.

The EU on the other hand set itself up as a vaccine hub that would be exporting globally, what it failed to do was look after its own citizens. Thats why you see Italy blocking exports of vaccines that other countries have paid for.

Contractually the UK is in the right, morally the UK has been one of the hardest hit countries in Europe and using the Italy argument that puts us in the right as well. Also we are actually using the vaccines being produced instead of storing them in a warehouse because of petty bureaucracy (Germany).

I don't think I am. I was talking about efficacy in preventing disease. Obviously. Nothing wrong with that. I never claimed or alluded to it being less.efficscious in preventing severe disease.

But fine, let's say they *are* equally efficacious in preventing severe disease. 

Everything I said stands. I was not being misleading in absolutely any way. I didn't gloss over anything. Everything I said was factual and fair and complete.

The trials for a 2 dose vaccine are ongoing and there is absolutely no guarantee as to what the outcome will be and whether people would.be getting the second shot. Even if they do, it won't be any time soon.

First, despite in-depth epidemiologic investigation, the findings represent an underestimate of the motorcycle rally’s impact in Minnesota and did not capture the impact within South Dakota or other states. Case interviews were voluntary, and patients could choose not to respond to certain questions. Ten patients reported having close contacts but refused to disclose additional details regarding these contacts. Therefore, it was not possible to identify all contacts of patients who attended the rally. Second, attendees and their contacts might not have been tested for SARS-CoV-2. Two rally attendees indicated that their contacts had COVID-19–like symptoms but did not plan to be tested. As such, the findings underrepresent the number of cases, close contacts, and secondary and tertiary cases. Finally, only 52 specimens were received at the MDH Public Health Laboratory because many testing laboratories do not retain or store specimens long-term. Among these specimens, only 38 were successfully sequenced.

Confidence is NOT the same thing as depending on something that is completely unknown. This is where you keep repeatedly getting it wrong. The state of CV today *will not* be the state of CV in 6 months. There are plenty of unknowns and several positive pieces of news, but every expert I've read and listened to says that this is absolutely NOT THE TIME to fuck around and find out.

Again, the link I posted would explain all of that to you if you chose to listen.

&gt; Further, I don't think zero COVID is or should be the goal.

Of course, that's the goal, but it's not attainable anytime soon. It may never be attainable because in all likelihood, CV19 will be around for a long time. We fucked up and let it spread far too much. There's no putting the genie back in the bottle with viruses. They either do or do not kill themselves off.

The goal is to get the infections down to a level where the vaccines are able to essentially stop community spread. We're extremely lucky to live in a time where we can actually vaccinate against an mRNA virus. That's huge and will probably save millions of lives.

But as the CDC director said in that interview and in other places, if we don't keep the rate of spread down (the R0 number) it *will* mutate. This is what viruses do. Every additional case that exists means a roll of the dice to see if a new mutation will happen.

Over time, viruses *tend* to become more contagious and less (directly) deadly as it does not behoove the virus to kill off its host until it can replicate. But the problem is that there's no negative to killing off the host *after* the fact, and lots of places the virus hides and can potentially resurface later.

This is why the ""99% of people survive!"" thing is absolute stupidity if you know anything about viruses. Google Post-polio syndrome if you are unaware. This is an extreme example, but what if CV19 mutates to become even more infectious, has more asymptomatic spread and then does long-term lung and organ damage to a large chunk of our otherwise healthy population?

THIS is why experts are telling people to be patient just a little longer. My goal is to get things under control and they are NOWHERE near that now. If nothing else, we need to give our already overworked healthcare professionals and first responders a break.

This is a great resource:
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html

[],,barchueetadonai,,,[],,,,text,t2_imac8,False,False,[],"I just don't think that'll be it at all (and June is way too early). I'm really thinking about people who are so incredibly anxious that they won't even feel comfortable right now seeing other people who are vaccinated even when they themselves are (and there are a lot of people like this).

I think a major issue is that when the CDC announces things that suggest we can lighten up in certain ways (such as cutting quarantine time from 2 weeks to 10 days or saying that vaccinated people can see each other without masks), there's always the thought that they're trying to make it so that at least we will still follow some basic principles. Basically, what I mean is that when Fauci says that over christmas, he highly recommends that people limit their gatherings and wear a mask when you can, he really means that of course no one should get together at all and you should never see you don't live with without a mask, but since way too many people are incapable of following basic science, he rather they do something rather than eschew all protections.

Essentially, there's been very good reason over the course of this pandemic to believe that the CDC's guidance has not been the objective best advice to follow if you're a capable, rational person. There's also the major, major concern that once mask guidance is lifted, that there will still be countless trumpies who never got vaccinated and will still be around to infect us.

I don't know, I'm probably predicting the worst, but I just really don't know what it'll take for the general consensus to be that of comfort if there's no full-on breaking point. Getting vaccinated yourself *should* be enough, but with the risk of variants, trumpies, and developing countries not being able to vaccinate everyone, it's going to be contentious for much longer than I think people realize.",,,1615391979,{},gqghmzb,False,t3_m1sj8m,False,True,t1_gqggccr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m1sj8m/daily_discussion_thread_march_10_2021/gqghmzb/,1615392873,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
