The control is top down and somewhat uniform. Contracts for equipment and services are generally tendered not by those who end up using them. For example a pilot can't ask for his plane to be serviced by anyone but who is contracted to do so. An army colonel doesn't get to choose what model of tank he'd like to equip his soldiers with. All those decisions are made by higher ups. This isn't absolute of course a soldier can buy his own boots and as long as they meet a spec or aren't expressly prohibited off they go.

It's not so much states vs federal government in having a military, an individual state could well provide public healthcare that would fit the bill of ""socialised healthcare"". No individual or private entity is allowed to raise a military force, bezos can't buy a fleet of tanks or fighter jets.

Even with free healthcare (no cost to patient when accessed) there is wide variation in service. In the UK there's a phenomenon known as postcode lottery, where available services may differ based on where you live (you are still welcome to have private insurance and avail yourself of whatever they provide). 

I'm probably not explaining it well, on mobile and busy. 

Let's compare buying a new phone to defending from a foreign aggressor. You are free to buy whichever phone you want you pay as much as you want.

Yeah, they don't like that, and they have Congress under control. The demonizing you're seeing is from exactly those middlemen using every dirty trick in the PR handbook to create demons. It's also a product of unstated racism from the masses. What you see in public is just the symptoms of their years of work to make the public opinion so. Public sentiment could probably be turned around without their constant and extremely well-funded interference. There is not an unethical but effective tactic they will not use.

The very, very large corporations that are ""the middlemen"" here managed to get themselves legally classified as people, which means they can affect politics as people do. Unlike actual people, they can spend millions to keep the billions coming. They can employ expensive armies of professionals to work full time keeping things the way they are, or making them worse. Their opposition has to try and fight back while also holding down a full-time job and raising children, or working three jobs just to support themselves. They send lobbyists directly into the halls of government to secure their interests with well-funded bribes. The opposition can only yell on the internet, where they're ignored.

That's the problem. But it's very easy to point at the problem, and nearly impossible to do anything meaningful about it. 

I'd appreciate it a lot if the general conversation would shift away from people wondering how Americans can bear to live like this.

Presumably western nations will get the bulk of doses first and try to heavily vaccinate populations,  if they’re willing.

The goal being herd immunity through vaccines.  The disease itself isn’t going anywhere.  Eventually it will be stamped out as a crippling pandemic (but still festering) in the west even in areas with a lower vaccine rate if we have a mix of vaccine and other easy measures like masks.  As long as the R0 drops below 1, the spread slows.

But the problem with going back to “normal” is that the virus will still be out there.  In pockets across the world.  People will still get sick here and there and local outbreaks will need to be contained *especially* when vaccine rates are high enough for people to think they’re returning to normal but not high enough to actually establish herd immunity.

At that point the key to making life as normal as possible will be aggressive contact tracing, so that small outbreaks can be limited.  You trace contacts and the contacts of those contacts to get them to stay home and nip minor outbreaks in the bud.  That will be a thing for a *while* after widespread vaccinations.

So there’s a “new normal” coming for a while, but it’s not living the life we are now.  It’s something in between 2019 and 2020.  Probably mostly, but not entirely, “normal”.  And it’ll take some time to get there.  Then when we have true herd immunity from these vaccines, it’s the old world we knew with one more endemic disease.",,,1605536153,{},gchvk2a,False,t3_jv5mem,False,False,t1_gchqqk8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jv5mem/modernas_coronavirus_vaccine_found_to_be_nearly/gchvk2a/,1605593689,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

We have been distancing and keeping all activities outdoors - masks in social settings - for the duration.

I don’t mind a lick wearing a mask, and I am not giving the mask or the restrictions the “power” over my life- like these people who claim that it’s about “control.” 

Anyway, for this entire time- we have not been “afraid of dying” (although, also, not flouting rules with hubris because my husband HAS see very ill among our age group... though they survive he said they do NOT look comfortable when they come in)... we are AFRAID OF SPREADING. And similar to you, I am just so DISAPPOINTED in the community and the BS and the spin that there were even “lockdowns” here (there weren’t - you could go to hobby lobby, Lowes, Harris teeter all in the same day - and even every single day - and no one was stopping you).... it’s just all for their political team.

Ummm fuck you???? Also, my husband has been accused of getting those “covid bucks” which was so effing dumb. If I’m mentally exhausted it’s because of the anti-mask STUPIDITY and the let down of the community who thinks they are special little snowflakes who are above public health. 

Anyway, convoluted response, sorry if this rant made no sense. I just wanted it off my chest and agree with you. 

I just say “it’s not about ‘me’ it’s also about those I could infect.” I have had many older ladies refuse to wear masks and tell me its “okay” for me to take mine off. I just pointedly say - “I think you would prefer I keep this on, my husband does high risk procedures regularly and although we have been blessed with PPE that has held thus far- 1700+ health care workers have gone down and if we are in the unlucky group somehow - would prefer to take down no one else with us.

$13k EOB. Insurance has a negotiated rate to a lower amount, say $10k. They have auditors on both ends to make sure all paperwork is proper.

You have a deductible, copay, and out of pocket max that factors in how much you pay. But that is between you and insurance. Insurance pays their part of the $10k bill. You pay your part. 

Larger companies are usually self insured but have an insurance company do the admin work. So you might have BCBS but those costs are all payed by your employer. 

Companies use insurance as a way to get and retain talent. They don’t want uncontrolled costs.

It’s the malpractice insurance that drives up costs. We do more testing because it reduces the liability if something does goes wrong. We also tend to replace equipment more often and with more bleeding edge that comes at a much higher cost, and have more private rooms than other countries. 

We also have higher mortality rates because people don’t do preventative care because they don’t have insurance or don’t know their insurance covers preventative at 100%. Maternity care is one of these areas, and why we have such a higher mortality rate. 

We have socialized healthcare for the elderly and poor. But you have to take action to enroll. Also some Americans make the choice to not buy insurance since they are young / healthy.

If it is the schedule, please know that I have never worked these many hours for teaching before. I was given two new preps right before school started, one in a field I know nothing about. I have no education, experience, or background in this class, and I have no curriculum or textbook for any of my classes (I teach STEM electives). So I spend my Saturday researching about manufacturing so I can learn it myself, then I decide what I’m going to teach and create all the slides/assignments/projects/rubrics/tests from scratch. Then I do the same thing for my other new prep, but it is easier because I do have a background in it. Then Sunday mornings I write full lesson plans for my 5 daily preps (new principal requires detailed lesson plans...) for the week. So 25 lesson plans each Sunday morning, then in the afternoons I record my lectures for the virtual students, because my school is teaching virtual and in person at the same time. 


I have children (including a special needs daughter), and that takes up a lot of time too. Especially because I kept them home; so I sit down and do my kids’ school work with them every day when I get home from teaching. We finish their work/dinner/baths etc around 9, and then I grade until I go to bed. In a normal year I wouldn’t be going through all their work at home, they would go to school in person. It’s hard to work full time and “home school” the kids. I promise, I am working nonstop. Every single day. 


If it is the pay you doubt, that is actually a raise. I live in Texas, and I made $41k two years ago. Texas voted to give teachers a raise in 2019, and my pay went up almost $7k.

Vaccine developers globally are scrambling to work out how to ship and store their vials, some of which must be kept in specialised freezers at extremely low temperatures. The logistical challenge was brought into sharp focus after promising interim trial data for the vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer, a major breakthrough in the race to curb the pandemic. This vaccine needs to be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, equivalent to an Antarctic winter, posing a challenge for even the most sophisticated hospitals in the United States.

Whether being trucked across Siberia or flown to the far reaches of the Arctic, its vials must be stored at minus 18 degrees Celsius or below, according to the Gamaleya Institute which developed the shot. But Russia has also been testing a version that has undergone lyophilisation, turning the liquid vaccine into a dry, white mass that can be stored at normal fridge temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius . Russia has not previously disclosed how many doses of freeze-dried vaccine it is planning to produce. But Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund , which is backing and marketing the vaccine, told Reuters it would soon be the main focus.

""""We have conducted trials that confirm that the immune response to the lyophilised form is the same as to the standard form of the vaccine. Interim results for the vaccine in liquid form showed the shot to be 92% effective. Lead scientist at the Gamaleya Institute, Alexander Gintsburg, said in an interview with Reuters earlier this year that freeze-drying was not yet a primary focus, as lyophilisate is more expensive and takes longer to produce. Russia plans to produce around 2 million doses of Sputnik V this year, ramping up to 15 million per month by the spring.

Contracts seen by Reuters in the state tender register show that the Gamaleya Institute placed an order for materials from laboratory supplier Dia-M to be used for packaging 2.9 million doses of the shot in liquid form, and 720,000 doses freeze-dried. The health ministry, which supervises the Gamaleya Institute, did not comment on the contracts. The health secretary of the Brazilian state of Bahia told Reuters he had ruled out buying the vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech as they required ultra-cold freezers for transportation. Bahia signed a deal with Russia for 50 million doses of Sputnik V in September.

Russia is not alone in looking at freeze-drying. In Japan, Daiichi Sankyo Co is making a so-called messenger RNA -based candidate which it hopes will give it an edge for storing at higher temperatures. In late September, Russian authorities ran a test of the supply chain, sending small quantities of the vaccine in liquid form to every region of the country.

I would just go straight to urgent care or the ER because talking to a doctor was pointless. I have stories...

So I move back to the Midwest and find myself a doctor and my first appointment I think she spent 45 minutes with me just talking. And she isn't an anomaly. My last doctor before I moved would take the time to explain things, give options, discuss each of our opinions about how to handle symptoms.

The difference in medical care between the Midwest and DC was stark and consistent from doctors to specialists to urgent care. ER I would say is similar for whatever reason.

So I feel the problem you're describing isn't actually a function of the doctors themselves, but rather the administrators and the financial pressures of living in a high-cost, high-density area where doctors and nurses and even janitors and the rent all cost more and insurance probably pays about the same as here.

While your post may not be misinformation per se since yes, it is true that elderly tend not to build as strong of an immune response as the young, it is dangerous thinking that the most vulnerable populations should not be the first to receive the vaccine. Even if the vaccine was only 70% effective in the elderly, those 30% who do get it are much more likely to mount a robust immune response and significantly decrease hospitalizations. These numbers are made up / speculation but we see the same effect in influenza vaccines - even those who ultimately catch the virus tend to have a much better prognosis than those who do not. 

The elderly (75+) and healthcare workers will be the first to receive the vaccine, as it should be.

*A [recent studyexternal icon](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1916433) analyzed samples from 51 EVALI cases from 16 states and a comparison group of samples from 99 comparison individuals without EVALI for vitamin E acetate, plant oils, medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, coconut oil, petroleum distillates, and diluent terpenes.*

*Vitamin E acetate was identified in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples (fluid samples collected from the lungs) from 48 of the 51 EVALI patients, but not in the BAL fluid from the healthy comparison group.*

*No other toxicants were found in BAL fluid from either group, except for coconut oil and limonene (1 EVALI patient each).*

*Due to continued declines in new EVALI cases since September 2019, and the identification of vitamin E acetate as a primary cause of EVALI, today’s release is the final CDC update on the number of hospitalized EVALI cases and deaths nationally.

&gt;As a Swede you have the best access to resources on this topic, but neglect to elaborate on these resources when communicating with the rest of the world. Instead you blame ""international press"" for tarnishing your country's reputation, and not the controversial actions/statements themselves for having taken place.
&gt;

Exactly! So you must understand how frustrating it is when the Swedish press manages to stay pretty objective. I have seen and heard articles supporting both crowds, without taking a stance themselves. It's obviously hard though, when it comes to subjects that are, for stupid reasons, so sensitive. I guess that, when I think about it, reddit acts like another filter in a sense. International media tends to have the ""SWEDEN USED HERD IMMUNITY"" approach. And so do the posters on here. How many articles on here have you seen that say the opposite? It is often the same posters every time as well.

I don't blame anyone for tarnishing anything though. I just think that people deserve to know the actual truth.

&gt;CDC is actively working to learn more about the whole range of short- and long-term health effects associated with COVID-19. As the pandemic unfolds, we are learning that many organs besides the lungs are affected by COVID-19 and there are many ways the infection can affect someone’s health.

&gt;While most persons with COVID-19 recover and return to normal health, some patients can have symptoms that can last for weeks or even months after recovery from acute illness. Even people who are not hospitalized and who have mild illness can experience persistent or late symptoms. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate. CDC continues to work to identify how common these symptoms are, who is most likely to get them, and whether these symptoms eventually resolve.

&gt;The most commonly reported long-term symptoms include:

&gt;- Fatigue

&gt;- Shortness of breath

&gt;- Cough

&gt;- Joint pain

&gt;- Chest pain

&gt;Other reported long-term symptoms include:

&gt;- Difficulty with thinking and concentration (sometimes referred to as “brain fog”)

&gt;- Depression

&gt;- Muscle pain

&gt;- Headache

&gt;- Intermittent fever

&gt;- Fast-beating or pounding heart (also known as heart palpitations)

&gt;More serious long-term complications appear to be less common but have been reported. These have been noted to affect different organ systems in the body. These include:

&gt;- Cardiovascular: inflammation of the heart muscle

&gt;- Respiratory: lung function abnormalities

&gt;- Renal: acute kidney injury

&gt;- Dermatologic: rash, hair loss

&gt;- Neurological: smell and taste problems, sleep issues, difficulty with concentration, memory problems

&gt;- Psychiatric: depression, anxiety, changes in mood

&gt;The long-term significance of these effects is not yet known. CDC will continue active investigation and provide updates as new data emerge, which can inform COVID-19 clinical care as well as the public health response to COVID-19.

Estimates right now are that ~10% of infected will experience longer term symptoms even after they stop testing positive.

In MI, daily cases are close to 9k a day, but death rate is way down. Way lower than what it was in April - June. However in April - June, our highest cases were coming in at around 2300-2500 a day. So, yes positive cases are substantially higher while death is significantly lower. which tells me that the mortality rate today is much lower (still high..) than what it appeared to be in the spring. So my thought is this. Because of more prevalent testing capabilities now, is it possible that in spring we had even MORE cases than what we are seeing now, just not reported? Meaning, If the death rate HASNT actually changed but with more testing it appears to be decreasing, wouldn’t that indicate that we were way under reporting in the spring?

America adopted these policies in the 80s.  At the time, a regular guy could get out of high school, go to work in a factory, support a stay-at-home wife and a family, send the kids to university, pay off his house, and retire.

Now two parents working won't get you that.

What happened?  Simple!  The 0.1% looted the US economy.  A  huge amount of extra value was created and thanks to Hayek and Friedman, they just put all that value in their pockets.

Worse, the poorest 80% of Americans lost something priceless - security.  Hayek and Friedman consider job security as having a very _negative_ value, even though for you, the person losing your job and perhaps then everything, job security has great value.

The rich have sloughed off a huge amount of the risk they used to bear - because they were easily able to bear it - onto the rest of us.  But when we get a $1,000,000 medical bill or lose our job as a doctor because treating a pandemic is not profitable, we as individuals find it crushing.

40 years of Hayek and Friedman have American on the ropes.  And if you think this is bad, it's going to be a lot worse two months from now.

I'm very much in the zero-risk camp, I don't go anywhere or do anything unless there will be no humans present at all. My parents still go out to stores and whatnot, but they don't do social functions. But a few months back (during a local lull in cases), after months of peer pressure from relatives, they were finally goaded into attending a dinner with extended family after receiving assurances that all sorts of safety protocols were going to be followed.

It was all lies. They showed up to the restaurant (which was supposed to be 100% just our own extended family) and there were all sorts of people there.

They were told each family unit would have separate socially distanced tables. Nope, one big table and people seated right next to each other and across from each other.

I would have noped out of there so fast, but my family very uncomfortably huddled in a corner away from everybody else, then left early.

Similarly, my grandmother has been very intensely socially distancing since this all began and is taking it very seriously. She's in her 80s, she can't get this thing. She's been very lonely, she would normally meet with family almost every day. But our family has been heinously irresponsible and lax; meanwhile they never stop trying to get her to meet up with them. They work her over every week.

She was finally guilt tripped into attending a cousin's dumb-ass engagement party for a wedding that's still years away. She was assured that everybody would be socially distanced, wearing masks, windows would be open, and that one person would serve the food. Nope. All lies. Almost nobody wore masks, everybody mobbed the hors d'oeuvre finger foods (!!) and buffet style dinner, and nobody was observing social distancing. My grandmother went by herself outdoors to be sad and ignored.

**TL;DR:**

I don't know WTF is wrong with people. I love my relatives, but my grandmother and immediate family aside, they've all just given up.

Starting on 16 March, all primary schools, daycare and similar places were also closed for two weeks.[7] Virtual (online) schooling was used to some degree.[99] The municipalities are establishing limited daycare for children where the parents could not stay home and take care of them. Because of the vulnerability of elderly to COVID-19, it was strongly recommended that grandparents should not take care of their grandchildren.[100]

&gt; Starting on 18 March at 10:00 AM, a number of further restrictions were activated: it became illegal to assemble more than ten people in public, all shopping centres and stores with close contact such as hairdressers and nightclubs must be closed, restaurants can only serve take-away, and other businesses must ensure that there is enough space between customers.[101] Unlike previous restrictions on the number of people allowed to assemble, the new restrictions are not merely a recommendation, and breaking the new restrictions is associated with fines of DKK1500.[101] On 23 March, it was announced that the above lockdown measures would be extended for a further 2 weeks, and be in place until 13 April.[102]

Basically it was a month of schools being closed, restaurants, bars, hair dressers closed. The borders closed. Here you can see how fast the numbers of patients went up in March.

Sweden had more of a advisory approach and kept everything running. The death rate went up pretty fast and kept climbing in that period.

Residents are also explicitly excepted from most labor laws, so shit tends to roll downhill onto them if the attendings demand better. Beyond that, there's also a culture of self-martyrdom in medicine that's really difficult to put into words if you haven't experienced it first hand. It's hammered into doctors throughout medical school and residency. They are expected to make the very core of their identity into helping the patient at all personal costs.

If you aren't willing to do that, maybe you should re-evaluate whether or not this is the right path for you.""

&gt; Of which there were a lot.

The point about initial deaths was that when the epidemic started, countries were not prepared and a lot of deaths can be attributed to simple mistakes protecting different populations. If you really want to do honest comparison of how different countries and their models of making the society to work in pandemic fare against each other, then it is good to chose a date after the first wave to do the real comparison.

&gt; My father worked as a medical consultant full time until 83. I have relatives still working in their 70s and 80s. So there's a lot of productive years post 65 which are being lost.

Even if you are +65 and get Corona diagnosis, it is not a death sentence. The point about deaths being mostly in +65 age group is that two fold: 

* Deaths are not happening in active age groups, this is important as with Spanish flue most deaths actually in age group between 15-40. That is why Spanish flue was to shocking to societies and when the Corona epidemy started, we were comparing Corona to Spanish flue, but as we have later seen, this is false comparison.
* Deaths in the age group +65 mostly happen to people already in bad condition, like I said before, Corona got into elderly care homes and that spiked up deaths. Later on Swedes have managed to keep the Corona out of care homes.

&gt; Also, it's often not a pleasant death which people seem to neglect mentioning when they keep bringing up the whole ""those people were old already when they died, though"" line of argument.

That is not an argument. Most deaths are not pleasant.

&gt; In this case at least 6164 Swedes are not doing so great.

Most of them would have anyway died soon, either to Corona or to Influenza.

&gt; Also, if we're doing comparisons, how about to Vietnam. A country which has a population of over 9 times Sweden and if deaths there continue at their present rate/year and Sweden doesn't have any more, Vietnam should catch up in over 175 years.

The reason why we don't do comparisons to Vietnam or to China is because these countries are not free. They are autocracies were information is not free. If China or Vietnam would be running same kind of death rates as for example Sweden, how would you know about that? For example in Sweden in 2018, according to official statistics 2701 people died to Influenza. If we would not be testing for Corona, how would you know that there is epidemy? The death rates are not that high to make a visible distinction.

&gt;&gt; as country they are doing great
&gt; Maybe, and hear me out here, maybe they're not.

You have to decide on what is the statistics you are looking for in order to say that. According to deaths per capita, they haven't done that bad.

That's really not how the immune system works.

You're probably in the 1% chance of death age bracket or less for the disease (considering Reddit demographics); so the the that hypothetical vaccine would reduce your chance of death to 0.2%.

Chinese vaccines require 2-8°C for 5 months storage.

There are many vaccines being prepared in other nations which have commited supplies to COVAX.

Serum Institute of India has planned to supply 500 million doses to Low and Middle Income countries.

Bharat Biotech is in talks with regional countries to supply and license them.

Australia has commited $500 million to provide vaccines to South East asian countries.

Sanofi has pledged 200 million doses to COVAX. 

Biological E (India) will produce 1 billion doses for Asian Market as well as African.

Novavax has a similar deal with Serum Institute of India to provide 2 billion doses to Low and Middle Income countries.

Chulakorn University of Thailand has also stated that their vaccine will be shared with SE asian countries.

Looking through your comment history, its clear that you are a CCP supporter trying to deflect credibles blames and accusations on china. Additionally you are trying to potray that only chinese vaccines are logistically viable for third world countries which is not at all true.

You try to hide your bias under the ""storage"" requirements.


Many of the Indian as well as Western vaccines do not have tough storage requirements.

Just Pfizer and to a certain degree Moderna.

J&amp;J, Novavax, Covaxin, Codagenix, Zydus Cadila, AstraZeneca, CureVac, Biological E, Sanofi &amp; GSK, Medicago to name a few.

Many western vaccines also have an added advantage such as Single Dose (J &amp; J), Intranasal (Codagenix and University of Washington- Bharat Biotech).

&gt; A traveling nurse on assignment in Texas described “horrific” conditions for patients with COVID-19 as hospitals reach max capacity amid a dramatic surge in local cases.

&gt; Among the most shocking claims made by registered nurse Lawanna Rivers about her time working at the University Medical Center in El Paso is the existence of a room she calls “The Pit,” where the worst COVID-positive patients were sent to die with minimal treatment and limited efforts at resuscitation.

&gt; Due to the sheer number of patients at the hospital, she and other nurses were instructed to give each person in “The Pit” just three rounds of CPR before the person was pronounced dead  — a significant reduction to the normal efforts aimed at keeping patients alive.

&gt; “I saw a lot of people die that I felt like shouldn’t have died,” Rivers said in a nearly 50-minute Facebook live video posted Nov. 7. “Out of all the codes that we had there, there’s not a single patient that made it.”",,,1605513850,{},gch6uox,True,t3_jv33ln,False,False,t3_jv33ln,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jv33ln/el_paso_nurse_tells_of_horrific_conditions_inside/gch6uox/,1605579445,349,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It was unreasonable to believe that ""everyone"" in Sweden had been infected. And since Fauci et al have been talking about a second wave from the beginning, the Swedish government/hospitals/etc were more than likely preparing for this. The Swedish government has said all along that this was never the expected goal.

All they were trying to do is to allow the Swedish people to have as normal a life as possible, without authoritarian (but well-intentioned) laws. Instead, they just made recommendations and put a limit on gathering size. Realistically, that probably makes more of a difference than masks, but much less so than a lockdown. So Sweden ended up having a high positivity rate and it's cited as a failure on their part. That's just how it works when you don't delay it.

And unlike in the US, the Swedish people have a lot of trust in their government. (Why wouldn't they, they take care of everything for them!) So they don't need to formally declare these laws to get people to actually listen.

That said, I'm in the US, and there's no way it would happen that way here. The difference in population density is a major factor. The availability of healthcare is another. The fact that we're one of the most unhealthy countries and thus more likely to have people die from it... also a factor. But most importantly, I think it's the attitude towards the government, in large part due to the fact that their government has served them well. I can guarantee you that the Swedish people followed that limited crowd guideline better than too many people in the US did.

So I feel like this whole ""Sweden is going for herd immunity"" thing (which is a misappropriated term anyway, YOU CAN GET HERD IMMUNITY FROM A VACCINE, IT DOES NOT MEAN ""DO NOTHING"") is kind of a straw man argument that's been repeatedly used to criticize Sweden's coronavirus strategy.

E.g. seeing patients, prescribing medications, plan of treatment, etc. Meanwhile, their education is maybe 1/2 of yours. PA school is a 2 years masters program. NP if I recall is 2-3 years as well, but you need practical nursing experience to apply to most programs from my understanding. They get paid competitively, but certainly not as much as physicians and have similar knowledge. Also, to be fair no one pushed you into that career path and of course the 8-12 yr education path of undergrad, med school, residency, or fellowship. You knew the amount of debt you would face as well as the long hours, but I am sure it's been worth it from a standpoint of serving patients and helping your community, as well as the compensation. One of my take home points from my prior post was, I don't care to wait for a doctor for 30 minutes then to have 5-10 minutes of his time just to get a script. I want a plan and suggestions, and if a RX is necessary so be it. Healthcare has declined and it is all about pushing drugs rather than spending time with patients to learn about their ailments.

Personal anecdote: In a lot of instances, there have been times where I scheduled an apt with an outpatient center and was met with an NP or PA, but expected a doctor. These same individuals are doing what you do but may never come close to your overall compensation albeit in some instances it can be close. At the end of the day, I am not trying to discredit physicians and I respect them because I know it is an important part of our society. I just think that healthcare administrations need to do a better job in regards to scheduling so that you can actually learn about your patients, actually listen to what is going on, and start to diagnose rather than a quick 5 minute assessment and writing a RX for them. Promoting physical therapy more often as an alternative over opioids or muscle relaxants. Being educated in nutrition and kinesiology/exercise so you can understand dietary ailments and prescribe movement as medicine!

&gt;It took 300 days for the U.S. to hit the 11 million mark since the first case was diagnosed in Washington state on Jan. 20.
COVID-19 has now killed more than 246,000 people in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins.
States and local governments are beginning to enforce stricter measures to reduce the spread of the virus. Chicago’s mayor Lori Lightfoot issued a stay-at-home advisory for the city earlier in the week. Washington state announced new precautionary measures on gyms and dining Sunday.
Within the past week both California and Texas topped over one million confirmed cases in the state.

Idk if they've made any progress with it, but when the system first rolled out (lol), Δ-9-THC isolates were the only form of ""cannabis"" authorized for prescription. Eventually vape cartridges came along and made the whole thing a bit less weird, but at first the only option you had were just capsules of pharmaceutical grade Δ-9-THC extract. No actual plant matter or any of the other naturally occurring cannabinoids found in cannabis were allowed. CBD as well. But that's a weird exception since you could still go buy CBD it from a head shop or online as long as it met FDA standards, was sourced from their legal definition of hemp, meaning the plant could not contain any measurable concentration of THC, and didn't claim to be marketed for any medicinal uses or properties. I think the laws concerning CBD chilled out in the past year or two though and you can now get prescribed pharmaceutical grade CBD for medical reasons, and the definition of what plants CBD could legally be extracted from was expanded to include  pretty much any type of hemp or marijuana plants, so long as the final extract has less than 0.3% THC by weight.

The really weird part though was the legal risk of getting targeted by federal agents was placed on MN doctors, rather than dispenseries since there were none under this system. So no doctors were willing to openly advertise that they would prescribe THC, since they didn't want to get raided or arrested by the feds. What this ended up creating was a really weird, underground network of doctors who were willing to see medical marijuana patients, but you as a patient would have no idea which doctors they were. So all the advertising and referring was done on the hush hush by word of mouth. It's become a bit more common knowledge who some of these doctors are, especially the ones who run pain management clinics in the wealthy, white suburbs.

Fair point.

Sure. In the example that you have given of course the smaller country is easier to manage. But most countries do not compare like that.

The larger the country is, the larger the resources (nurses/industrial capacity/chemical test labs) it has to combat the virus. So sheer population size on its own does not present more difficulties. What does not scale so well is entry points.

The US really only has a border with Mexico to worry about and international airports and seaports. Whilst it has about 15 times the population of Australia I doubt it has 15 times as many entry points as Australia. All things being equal the US (and Europe probably) have less entry points when scaled for population. So conceivably it should be easier for them to manage the virus.

The countries that have it hard are small and/or poor countries with proportionally many entry points. Small countries may not have the infrastructure to produce required goods (ppe/test kits) nor may have the numbers and skills (managers/nurses/computerised contact tracing/ICU units to manage surges) to easily manage an outbreak. This would apply to places like Denmark / Switzerland / Some Central American countries and a lot of African countries.

So I think an argument can be made that smaller countries have it harder. Having said that, Australia probably has it easier than most countries of comparable population due to our wealth/guaranteed food supply and high level of industrial sophistication.",,,1605501261,{},gcgr2es,False,t3_ju7pg8,False,True,t1_gce2bwr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ju7pg8/australia_may_see_first_week_of_no_local_covid19/gcgr2es/,1605570773,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

When they came along I jumped on them.  The thing that has helped me the most was my dedication to never stop learning and my professional reputation preceded me. 

In time things will change for the better but it will take people advocating and lobbying for changes.  Now people are starting to see where the skill sets and scopes of practice (base SOP not the expanded scopes of critical care, offshore,  austere etc)  autonomy are so much wider for a paramedic then a nurse, yet experienced paramedics make half or less of a nurse who just passed nclex yet both spent the same amount of time in school. 

Honestly some of the things this pandemic have exposed will be the cause of change down the road for those who will enter the field in the future.  

Outside of my work I advocate for the profession via various groups to improve quality of life for my brothers and sisters in this field.  I’ve had nurses who were heads of nursing unions and groups talk down to or about saying how I and others in the field were stupid and uneducated to legislators.  You could imagine the surprise when I spoke and called that group rep out on their lies and compared not only backgrounds but skill sets/scope of practice, and people skills/bed side manner.   As a result of that advocacy that year EMTs and Paramedics in Texas got an expanded scope of practice when working in ER &amp; hospital settings.

I never got into this field to make money, it was to help people in their hour of need, and make a difference.  From there I kept learning, taking classes, etc and as opportunities came up I jumped on them.  I know many that pass the opportunities up for fear of failing and ending back where they were.  Play it safe as it were.  Me personally I’d rather try and fail then not try at all.

In this pandemic it hasn’t been all contract work for me.  I have spent a lot of time deployed with federal disaster medical teams (NDMS DMAT) going back to late Jan/ early feb.  while I might not make the big contracting $$$ I could be, it’s still hard yet satisfying work.  Why because everyone who is deployed with me has the same goal and driven to succeed.  Those on these teams most never have heard of but are professionals who don’t join these teams for recognition but when the call for help goes out they answer the call without thing twice.  They put there lives on hold, grab their deployment bags/gear and head out.

The MMR for example is 88% effective against mumps and 97% against measles for kids who get both doses (a bit less for kids who miss the second dose). DTaP is similar, although requires periodic boosters throughout life, and polio gets close to 99-100% effective if a kid gets all the doses. Flu is a bit of an outlier that depends a lot on how good the vaccine was at targeting the right strains in a given season, but hangs out in the 40-75% effective range, although it greatly decreases ICU admissions even when it doesn't decrease infections.

On my hand is a user manual for 3M reusable respirator. On ""Cleaning Reusable Respirators"":

\- Step 1: remove cartridges or filters

\- Step 4: Disinfect the respirator by soaking in household bleach for 2 minutes (30ml of bleach in 7.5L of water).

According to [this handy guide](https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1793959O/cleaning-and-disinfecting-3m-reusable-respirators-following-potential-exposure-to-coronaviruses.pdf), also by 3M.

&gt;However, some 3M filter products have a hard-plastic case surrounding the filter media, i.e., NIOSH part numbers 7093, 7093C, 6092X, and D8092X as well as EN (European) part numbers 603X, 609X, D809X and D903X. The outside surface of the hard-plastic case can be wiped down for cleaning and disinfection using a clean damp cloth soaked in solution. For disinfecting solution, apply until visibly wet for the appropriate contact time and then remove the disinfecting solution with a clean, water-soaked cloth and air dry. Do not allow the cleaning or disinfecting solution to reach the internal filter media and do not submerge the hard-case filters in any liquid. For filters with hard plastic cases, utilize the same cleaning and disinfection solutions as recommended for 3M facepieces.

So, what are the ""the same cleaning and disinfection solutions as recommended for 3M facepieces""? 3M actually list different disinfection wipes and products and their compatibility with different face pieces. There are the [3M™ C. Diff solution tablets (EPA Reg. No. 71847-6-10350)](https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1306554O/3m-c-diff-solution-tablets-technical-data-sheet.pdf), which makes bleach, and S[ani-Cloth® Bleach Germicidal wipes (EPA Reg. No 9480-8)](https://pdihc.com/products/environment-of-care/sani-cloth-bleach-germicidal-disposable-wipe/), which contains 630 ppm chlorine, among other solutions. 

Yes, there are certain concerns about exhausted, butter-fingered people screwing up their bleach use and that's probably valid. Surprisingly or unsurprisingly, [these](https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/pdf/cleaning-handwashing-5percent-liquid-bleach.pdf) [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/make-chlorine-solution.pdf) instructional leaflets never made it to the public.

[],,lgigi69,,,[],,,,text,t2_2aj0jzkl,False,False,[],"The American biotech has completed human trials.  This year it is ready to deliver 20 million doses to the United States.  Next year, between 500 million and one billion will arrive in the rest of the world as well.  They can be transported at refrigerator temperatures: 2-8 degrees.
 And now there are two.  The modern American biotech coronavirus vaccine also has a very high efficacy: 94.5%.  A week ago Pfizer and BioNtech had announced the figure of 90%.  Both vaccine candidates came out of human trials with much better than expected results.  The minimum percentage of effectiveness required was in fact 50%.  Like Pfizer last Monday, Moderna also released its data today only with an announcement to the press.  Scientific publications are still missing, but will probably arrive soon, with further details on the type of protection offered (if only from severe symptoms of the disease or even from contagion) and on the effectiveness in the elderly, which is generally lower than in young people.
 Compared to the vaccine from Pfizer and the German BioNtech, Moderna's is much more American.  The biotech is headquartered in Massachusetts, has received $ 2.4 billion in funding from the US government, via Operation Warp Speed ​​and has announced for the time being that it will seek emergency approval from the Federal Food and Drug Administration.  .  In any case, the European Medicines Agency has started the advance analysis of the data, the so-called ""rolling review"", which allows to anticipate the approval times.

 The first 20 million doses produced by 2020 will be destined for the American market.  In 2021, other doses, between 500 million and one billion, are expected for the global market.  The price of the vaccine, $ 25 according to press reports, will likely include a profit share as well.  The other companies have so far announced that they will sell it at cost, at least as long as the pandemic declaration persists.


 

 Moderna's vaccine had no side effects, at most some degree of fever, some fatigue and soreness at the injection site.  She needs a second dose four weeks after the first one (for Pfizer this is three weeks).
 
 Phase three of the trials, the final one, began on July 27 (exactly the same day as Pfizer) and involved 30,000 volunteers, all in the United States.  Half was given the vaccine, half the placebo.  Among them, 95 became ill, 90 in the placebo group and 5 in the vaccinated group.  None of the vaccinated had severe symptoms, while 11 of the unvaccinated positives were affected by severe Covid.  Fifteen of the 95 infected were over 65.  From these numbers we calculate the value of the effectiveness, which is precisely 94.5%.  But only the volunteers who received a swab were included among the positives, not the asymptomatic ones.  This - as for Pfizer and BioNTech - leaves open the question of the type of immunity offered: whether it is sterilizing (the vaccine prevents you from becoming infected and infecting others) or only from symptoms (vaccinated do not get seriously ill but can transmit the virus  to the others).",,,1605542286,{},gci6z0i,False,t3_jv95vn,False,True,t3_jv95vn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jv95vn/coronavirus_moderna_also_announces_its_vaccine/gci6z0i/,1605600152,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

As a a general rule of thumb, the most effective vaccines at providing long-term immunity, are live-attenuated vaccines.  Followed by killed vaccines.  Followed by toxoid vaccines (which take a protein or toxin produced the microbe, conjugate it to a virus that transforms DNA).  

So I wonder if the effectiveness of an mRNA vaccine will be more in the range of a toxoid vaccine, or more like somewhere between the effectiveness of a toxoid vaccine and a killed vaccine.  

mRNA, btw is neither DNA or protein, it is the transitional product between the two.  So it stands to reason, that it should be a little better than a toxoid vaccine at conferring long term immunity, but probably less effective than a live-attenuated vaccine.  

Of course, the effectiveness of live-attenuated vaccines depends also the organism.  The flu is live-attenuated, but the flu shot from last year isnt gonna be protective very long.

The mobility variable studied that showed the largest increase in the prevalence of the disease was working on site at the workplace (increased the risk by 76%). **A significant higher prevalence of the disease was also detected among respondents who used the modality of acquiring basic commodities using home delivery service compared to those who chose in-store shopping.**
