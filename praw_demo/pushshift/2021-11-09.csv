Vaccination and mask requirements are actually closer to drunk driving laws than pure PPE regs. You haven’t driven while drunk for a year and a half - great! It doesn’t mean you should be allowed to drive drunk now. Driving drunk increases your personal risk of injury, but it also increases the risk to everyone around you, and no judge is going to care if it’s your personal choice to risk the lives of yourself and your children by polishing off a bottle of Jack and cruising downtown. 

You’re allowed to say you’re sick and tired of not being allowed to drive drunk with your family in the car.

&gt;”We must avoid preventable harm and protect patients in the N.H.S., protect colleagues in the N.H.S. and, of course, protect the N.H.S. itself,” Sajid Javid, the health secretary, told Parliament, referring to the National Health Service. He added that about 90 percent of the service’s workers had received at least two vaccine doses.

&gt;The measure, which is subject to parliamentary approval, is due to come into force on April 1. Exemptions will be available for people who are medically prevented from receiving vaccines and for health workers who have no face-to-face contact with patients.

&gt;That time frame is intended to ensure that workers who do not want to be vaccinated remain in their jobs during the winter, when the strain on the country’s overstretched health service is likely to be particularly acute.

&gt;England’s health service employs around 1.3 million workers, though not all are in frontline positions. About 80,000 to 100,000 N.H.S. workers in the country remain unvaccinated against Covid, according to Chris Hopson, the chief executive of N.H.S. Providers, a membership organization for the N.H.S. hospital, mental health, community and ambulance services.

&gt;Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can make their own decisions on the issue, and so far have not put forward proposals.

&gt;In Britain, one main concern is that people reluctant to be vaccinated will quit their jobs and worsen staff shortages within a health service that is under acute strain and that expects more pressure as winter sets in.

&gt;”The problem for both social care and the N.H.S. is that we run these systems incredibly hot on very, very fine margins,” he told the BBC. “Both of us have got around 90,000 to 100,000 vacancies.”

&gt;As virus cases rise across Europe, President Emmanuel Macron of France announced that people over 65 years old must get a booster shot to remain eligible for a vaccine “passport,” which is required to gain access to restaurants, museums, long-distance trains and other public places. The new rule takes effect Dec. 15.

&gt;Roughly 308 million pieces of personal protective equipment bought by the Dutch government, including masks, goggles and gloves, were rejected for use in hospitals, a spokesman for the health ministry said. The Netherlands recently reintroduced measures to slow the spread of the virus and ease the growing pressure on the country’s health system. Last week almost 77,000 people tested positive for the virus, according to government figures.

&gt;Hong Kong’s latest “zero Covid” policy — a mandatory smartphone tracking app — is prompting online mockery and pushback. Residents must show their LeaveHomeSafe app to enter any public government facilities — including outdoor markets, libraries and pools. One nongovernmental organization warned that the requirement, which started on Nov. 1, would hurt the homeless and others who do not have a smartphone but depend on government services.

&gt;About 3,000 people marched through Wellington, New Zealand’s capital, on Tuesday to protest vaccination requirements and coronavirus restrictions, forcing a lockdown of Parliament and closure of local streets. In recent weeks the government has announced sweeping vaccine mandates for about 40 percent of the country’s workers, as well as requirements for vaccination certificates to gain access to restaurants, gyms and public events.

According to the math, the WHO is correct and we should be giving the doses to poorer nations and that is why they have made their stand. The problem is that math ignores a lot of the messy details. Ever heard the joke about the physicist that figured out how to heal a sick cow, but only if it was spherical and in a vacuum? That's exactly what is happening here. There are two complications in particular that the WHO is ignoring:

1. Every unused dose in the US is not going to go to a different country. Sure, some of them will. But it's not as simple as the WHO would have you believe. Many of them are too close to expiration dates, or need refrigeration, or other issues.
2. Vaccine equity is a short term issue and boosters are a long term issue. By arguing against boosters as much as they are, they are discouraging people from getting them. They are so focused on people getting vaccinated initially that they are blind to the damage they are doing long term. Essentially scientists have been promoting antivaxxer talking points as some sort of chess game to promote vaccine equity, such as constantly talking about vaccine side effects. Instead, early research is pointing to the boosters being so efficient that in terms of infection and hospitalization, the gap between being unvaccinated and vaccinated is similar to the gap between being vaccinated and boosted. If we look at Israel, boosting appears to be helping them hit herd immunity, and cases are down 90%. Essentially, if everyone boosted in the US, the pandemic would likely be over, like how it was in the summer before Delta hit. Boosting is natural, pretty much every vaccine we take requires multiple doses months apart, and half a year ago this was the expectation being promoted to the public for the COVID vaccine.",,,,1636521809,{},hk199n9,False,t3_qql5tm,False,False,t1_hk16y0w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qql5tm/dont_wait_who_urges_us_to_pay_attention_as/hk199n9/,1636798909.0,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is in northern Indiana where they are abundant now and have been as long as I can remember.

He said once he remembered in the 1960's that it made the newspaper when some deer were observed in Wakarusa, IN.

I just pulled up an article that mentioned the deer population was hunted nearly out of existence by 1890 and then exploded in the 1980's (when I came of age) and that explains that.  Interesting.  Shines a big light on lyme disease and a bunch of other stuff too.

I live in Michigan and see vehicle-deer accidents constantly.  It's terrifying to think about nailing one on the freeway, where I see carcasses all the time.  A guy on a motorcycle was just killed in the county north of me the other day and it's the second time in a few months that's happened.  Ugh!

&gt;Abstract

&gt;Recently, Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness has decreased especially against mild disease due to emergence of the Delta variant and waning protection. In this register-based study among healthcare workers in Finland, the vaccine effectiveness of two-dose mRNA vaccine series against SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased from 82% (95% CI 79-85%) 14-90 days after vaccination to 53% (43-62%) after 6 months.

&gt;Similar trend was observed for other series. Waning was not observed against Covid-19 hospitalization. These results facilitate decision-making of booster doses for healthcare workers.",,,,1636534393,{},hk1px67,False,t3_qqceue,False,False,t1_hjzzj0f,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qqceue/israeli_study_shows_how_covid19_immunity_wanes/hk1px67/,1636807287.0,4,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,Stumposaurus_Rex,,,[],,,,text,t2_kwfr6,False,False,[],"A little eye roll this morning at Eric Topol's tweet trying to rev up that DOOM sentiment. Firstly, the national obsession with Case Counts when you have a two tiered system of risk (vaccinated risk v. unvaccinated risk) makes a case count chart lack meaningful context. 

Even ignoring the massive reduction in death/hospitalizations from the vaccines, even if you were *just* focusing on case counts, the vaccines have impact. Checking out NY's COVID dashboard they break down the case count per 100k for both vaccinated and unvaccinated, and as of Oct 11th that was 10.5 per 100k among the vaccinated compared to 51.3 per 100k among unvaccinated folks.

*""But Stumposaurus, have you heard about Waning Immunity?*"" 

Some interesting info is available at New York's COVID dashboard, they track the decline in effectiveness over time. They caution they can't say with certainty how much is due to declining antibodies v. the rise of Delta and it's massive viral load punch. Here's something fascinating though, vaccine effectiveness in terms of case prevention was at 91% in early May, dipped down to 73% in July, but then rebounded and is now at 79% currently. 

Even better news? The effectiveness at preventing hospitalizations was at 94% in May, and never had any meaningful decline. It's been in the range of 91-95% this entire summer and is currently at 94.5% as of Oct. 11th.

Vaccines. Work.

Floridians, some of us anyway, are just fucking dumb and have no idea what a strong case of covid might feel like. To them, it is an either/or situation. Live/die. And they are betting on winning that gamble.

I had a breakthrough case 2 months ago. Fully vaxxed, which I am so grateful for. I spent 6 days wishing I would die, but not quite to the level of wanting to risk going to the hospital. Didn't want to try to take a bed, if there was even one available, from someone worse off. Also didn't want to risk infecting anyone else in the process.

I felt like I was in a fight with Floyd Mayweather punching my kidneys for a week. My kidneys still hurt. May be lifelong damage there, may kill me in a few years. I didn't eat for FIVE DAYS. No shit. I wasn't hungry in the least. My stomach never growled. The thought of eating made me feel sick. It was very strange. I was able to stay hydrated.

This but unironically... imagine how many more life-saving medications and treatments would be available if the companies were allowed to just publish known side-effects with probabilities of each and allow doctors and patients to make their decision.

Of course, it should still be illegal to deliberately hide information regarding potential side-effects, and it would make sense to mandate trials before the drug is sold (so that companies can't simply refuse to gather information in the first place), but this is a different discussion.

As of yesterday the CDC COVID Data Tracker ([Link](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographics)) said there have been 282 deaths in the 0-4 Years age group, for only 959,829 cases.  That’s a case-fatality rate of 1 death per 3,404 cases; whereas the 5-11 Years age group, for which the vaccine was just authorized, only has 189 deaths per 2,065,945 cases.  The case-fatality rate for the group just authorized for the vaccine is 1 death per 10,931 cases.  It seems cases are much more likely to be fatal in the 0-4 age group.  

Death, of course, is not the only negative outcome from Covid-19.  The 0-4 age group also appears to be more likely to be hospitalized.  According to the CDC data available on COVID-NET ([Link](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/covidnet/covid19_3.html)) the cumulative rate of hospitalizations for 0-4 age group is 95.1 per capita (100,000).  The 5-11 age group has a cumulative hospitalization rate of only 33.6 per capita (100,000).  It seems children in the 0-4 years age group are much more likely to be hospitalized.      

In fact, if you look at the data for all pediatric age groups reported by the CDC, the 0-4 years age group has the WORST case-fatality rate and the WORST hospitalization rate of all pediatric age groups.  It seems to me that this is the group MOST in need of vaccination.

&gt;“I think we overestimated how badly it affects your risk of developing serious disease, and overestimated the duration of stay in hospitals. The spectrum of cases in hospital were less severe than they may have originally envisaged.”

&gt;Doherty modelling predicted the Pfizer vaccine was 93% effective at reducing overall transmission of the Delta variant, and AstraZeneca was 86%. Later data from overseas has suggested Pfizer and AstraZeneca are between 94% and 96% effective at reducing hospitalisations.

&gt;“Compared to the original strain … we thought Delta would make it much more likely you’d end up in hospital, putting vaccination aside,” Dore said.

You know what happened to all those subways when the pandemic first hit and the first lockdowns took effect. They were deserted.

There's also not much evidence of many people getting it through elevators and subways. Not much talking on those, ventilation is pretty good, and masks really help. It's mostly the sustained and unprotected or unventilated exposure at workplaces, schools, restaurants and parties that really spreads it.

[],,burtzev,,,[],,,,text,t2_3yb2p,False,False,,"The efficacy of any and all therapeutics or preventatives, vaccines included, is almost always lower in real world clinical use than in clinical trials. The reason isn't that the companies are faking their results. Those are real numbers and real people. Companies have a horror of 'getting caught' and understandably so. It would be the end of the company. 

The reason is that claims derived from clinical trials don't reflect what happens out on the street or in at the clinic. Companies select their experimental volunteers well. No sickies allowed. Nobody with a history of severe allegies can sit down for the poke. A bad reaction would mess up the whole trial. Few, if any, 95yr olds with constant coughing due to CHF are wheeled through the doors in their wheelchairs. And so on and so on. 

The simple reality is that what is presented after these trials is *not* the real effectiveness. That can only be found after huge numbers of people of all sorts are vaccinated and the numbers added up after a properly long period of time. The real world is not a laboratory. 

When a number from a clinical trial is magnified by the media common sense suggests that you *guess* at a percentage to subtract in your mind. This, of course, is only a guess by its very nature, but it's a comfort to know that there will always be *some* subtraction. The opposite, 'addition', is extremely rare. 

The big worry for the world now is declining effectiveness with the passage of time.

I think it would be really interesting to do in depth brain imaging on people who tend to think of long term outcomes vs. short-term. 

Plus, how do environmental factors play into? When they were a kid if they didn't know when their next meal would come would that condition people to think in short term outcomes? They just found a portion of obese people have a structural difference in a portion of their brain that involves motivational behaviour related to physical outcomes. It's crazy how much the brain plays into this just beyond ""thinking"". 

 Also, how do hormones play into it all as well? There are studies showing higher levels of testosterone are associated with increased risk taking which is the Pinnacle of short term outcomes. 

Another thing I have observed it seems education has a big factor when it comes to thinking in long term outcomes.

Really to me it would be really interesting to know how these aspects play into how people make these decisions. I don't think it's as simple as just think long term unfortunately. In some, it almost seems like it would have to be trained into them overtime. 

I know for me the whole covid lock down was evident and made complete sense. I wish it was a much harder lockdown than it was to save people. I always think long term what will be the consequence of benefit. If I ate a donut I would think about how that would effect when I 80 haha. That's the type of person I am. However, I still struggled during covid because I'm extremely extroverted, so that did make it harder for me personally. I literally built a porch just so I could talk to people that walked by outside at a safe distance lol. So my need for social interaction swayed me slightly toward short term outcomes. Although, not to a significant extent. 

I guess, it seems those that tend to think in long term outcomes tend to be much more successful in life unless your a president because people don't want to reelect you lol",,,,1636511827,{},hk0pxna,False,t3_qpjx2j,False,True,t1_hjy990t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qpjx2j/man_who_intentionally_caught_virus_wishes_he/hk0pxna/,1636789330.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not everyone is going to get tested, receive their result, and start taking this med within 3-5 days. And the hospitalization rate in the placebo group (over 6%) seemed to be higher than the actual average US hospitalization rate (1%-5% of those that test positive). But that doesn't mean it still won't have a high rate of efficacy in normal use. Just that it may be slightly less effective than it was in the trial.

The trial article said almost exactly what I did:

""Similar reductions in COVID-19-related hospitalization or death were observed in patients treated within five days of symptom onset; 1.0% of patients who received PAXLOVID™ were hospitalized through Day 28 following randomization (6/607 hospitalized, with no deaths), compared to 6.7% of patients who received a placebo (41/612 hospitalized with 10 subsequent deaths), with high statistical significance (p&lt;0.0001)""

So 6 people out of 607 in the treatment group were hospitalized vs. 41/612 in the placebo group. So out of their group of about 600, 35 hospitalizations were prevented. That doesn't mean that is only prevents 35 out of every 600 hospitalizations, just that if 600 people get Covid, 41 of them will be hospitalized without intervention. If you pay $700 each for this treatment for 600 people (since you don't know who is going to end up being hospitalized), you will prevent 35 hospitalizations. Considering the cost of treating all 600, about $12,000 will be spent per hospitalization prevented.

And I didn't actually mean it is totally a mystery why there isn't push back. I mean that it makes no logical sense and is obviously because of corruption.

&gt;The virus is surging in Vermont as more people gather inside to avoid the cold weather. Experts warn that holiday gatherings could lead to more cases this winter.

&gt;New daily cases have increased 51 percent over the past two weeks, according to a New York Times database. Hospitalizations are also trending upward, fueling anxiety about the state’s hospital capacity as winter approaches.

&gt;Vermont is testing for the coronavirus more than most states, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Last week, its Republican governor, Phil Scott, said in a statement that while testing had increased and the state’s positivity rate had stayed roughly the same, Vermonters needed to take all precautions they could. He also warned that if cases remain as high as they are, it “would be a significant strain” on the state’s hospitals.

&gt;At Saint Michael’s College, a liberal-arts school north of Burlington, 77 students tested positive for the virus this week and last week, according to the college’s Covid-19 dashboard. In letters to the school, Lorraine Sterritt, the college president, said that Halloween parties had fueled the outbreak.

&gt;”We were doing really well as a community up to the point where there were numerous Halloween parties where students were unmasked and in close contact,” she said in the letter on Sunday.

&gt;Before the post-Halloween surge, the college had reported 11 cases from Aug. 27 to Oct. 22, according to the dashboard. Saint Michael’s has about 1,700 students.

&gt;”To be in this situation after such a well-managed semester is heartbreaking,” Ms. Sterritt said in a letter on Friday. “It is imperative that everyone make wise choices.”

&gt;The college on Sunday suspended “in-person student social gatherings” through Thanksgiving and asked that students limit off-campus travel. The school moved its classes online on Friday amid the outbreak, but Ms. Sterritt said that in-person classes would continue this week.

&gt;Vermont is grappling with its highest number of new cases since the pandemic began, according to a New York Times database, even though it has one of the highest vaccination rates in the country.",,,,1636500123,{},hjzzrsv,True,t3_qqg51t,False,False,t3_qqg51t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qqg51t/a_vermont_college_says_halloween_parties_fueled_a/hjzzrsv/,1636775578.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Endemic's not really a *level,* it's a category of transmission. It's entirely possible that the current infection levels will become the new pattern as the virus mutates.

I think at this point it's time to really just focus more narrowly on ICU capacity. If there's minimal risk of running out of ICU beds, that's the only real metric that should be guiding society-wide restrictions.

If your own risk tolerance is lower than that, there are mitigations you can personally do. N95 masks are widely available again.

As we have heard over and over, the virus doesn't ""care"" what you think. Never has; never will.

Better to have benchmarks for when you can even think about shedding masks in schools. Just for one idea, keeping in mind that school spread almost always mirrors community spread: if (1) community transmission stays very low for about 3 weeks in a row AND hasn't increased in at least a week, (2) an overwhelming percentage of people who learn and work at a school are fully vaccinated (probably around 90%, thanks to Delta), and preferably both, then you can consider ditching masks. Again, that's just an idea; there are plenty of ways to approach the problem, and I'm not saying this is always right. But the bottom line is that you follow the numbers, and base decisions on what they tell you rather than how you feel things should be.

Comparing *vaccinated breakthrough infections* to the flu is fair, though.  The mortality rate is similar.

&gt; Plus, most of us do still actually care about the health and safety of people who are unvaxxed by choice.

Honestly, while I do not *want to* pass any virus to anyone, I do not think that the social contract requires me to act to protect those who are obstinately refusing to protect themselves, and who are less likely to take basic precautions (like masking) themselves.

If someone wants to remain unvaccinated, that is their right (and I don't think it should be), but their rights only extend to them and their behavior.  They don't have the right to expect others to wear masks for their protection.  In addition, if they want to protect themselves, they can wear an N95.

Things aren't expected to get much better.](https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/COVID-new-normal-risks-16557732.php) So you are actually talking about people making semi-permanent changes to their lives to protect your relatives who refuse to protect themselves.

Indeed, just about every account of the virus has been hard to read, whether it recounted innocent people struck down, or misinformed people victimized by their ""influencers,"" or victimizing, malicious politicians, or profiteering mask-engrossers. 

A lot of us are living with the sunk costs of avoiding something that, for at least a year, was reasonably considered both dreadful and mysterious, and which, rightly or wrongly, caused enormous disruptions to the socioeconomic fabric of the entire globe. 

Everyone who cares about these things is left with a lot of emotional baggage, and varying levels of insight about it. So much has been learned and done in the last year that has diminished the mystery and dread, but learning through stress leaves deep ruts. It's going to take some time, and considerable cognitive effort to heal--to get the risk assessments back into line. That's especially true for anxious people, and the reality is that now, almost everyone is profoundly anxious about something. That is aggravated because the media profit from anxiety and contention.

I'm boosted, but I'm still anxious in some settings, despite everything I rationally know about the risks. It's going to take a while to retrain myself. Meanwhile, I read about norovirus or flu, and I don't want those either.

Everyone over age 5 is eligible for the vaccine.

Essentially over age 18 is eligible for a booster.

Immunocompromised people are eligible for a third shot (which is still ~75% effective in that group) and then a booster 6 months later.

On top of that, there are now anti-virals that will be approved that can substantially reduce your risk (by 90%), if you find you are infected early enough (within 5 days of symptoms).

The mortality rate *for the vaccinated* is similar to the flu.  Yes, that means double the normal flu deaths.  But I don't think we need to ruin livelihoods by closing restaurants, etc. over this.

BACKGROUND  
Safe, effective vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) are urgently needed in children younger than 12 years of age.  
  
METHODS  
A phase 1, dose-finding study and an ongoing phase 2–3 randomized trial are being conducted to investigate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine administered 21 days apart in children 6 months to 11 years of age. We present results for 5-to-11-year-old children. In the phase 2–3 trial, participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive two doses of either the BNT162b2 vaccine at the dose level identified during the open-label phase 1 study or placebo. Immune responses 1 month after the second dose of BNT162b2 were immunologically bridged to those in 16-to-25-year-olds from the pivotal trial of two 30-μg doses of BNT162b2. Vaccine efficacy against Covid-19 at 7 days or more after the second dose was assessed.  
  
RESULTS  
During the phase 1 study, a total of 48 children 5 to 11 years of age received 10 μg, 20 μg, or 30 μg of the BNT162b2 vaccine (16 children at each dose level). On the basis of reactogenicity and immunogenicity, a dose level of 10 μg was selected for further study. In the phase 2–3 trial, a total of 2268 children were randomly assigned to receive the BNT162b2 vaccine (1517 children) or placebo (751 children). At data cutoff, the median follow-up was 2.3 months. In the 5-to-11-year-olds, as in other age groups, the BNT162b2 vaccine had a favorable safety profile. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were noted. One month after the second dose, the geometric mean ratio of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) neutralizing titers in 5-to-11-year-olds to those in 16-to-25-year-olds was 1.04 (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 0.93 to 1.18), a ratio meeting the prespecified immunogenicity success criterion (lower bound of two-sided 95% CI, &gt;0.67; geometric mean ratio point estimate, ≥0.8). Covid-19 with onset 7 days or more after the second dose was reported in three recipients of the BNT162b2 vaccine and in 16 placebo recipients (vaccine efficacy, 90.7%; 95% CI, 67.7 to 98.3).  
  
CONCLUSIONS  
A Covid-19 vaccination regimen consisting of two 10-μg doses of BNT162b2 administered 21 days apart was found to be safe, immunogenic, and efficacious in children 5 to 11 years of age.

His warning will fall on deaf ears in most of the US. It's a great shame that we had the right outlook early on in the pandemic, when we had lockdowns and accepted mask-wearing. But the ""public"" is mostly tired, want to ditch their masks, refuse any sort of lockdowns (except...NY had done it right. It remains to be seen if their new leadership will step up and act accordingly). 

In Florida we recently reopened to international tourism. Granted, most or all of these people are vaccinated. Yet: What is their vaccination status? Have they had a booster? Do they have immune problems? 

The very real fact that even vaccinated individuals can spread COVID and that variants from other countries will arrive and spread is terrifying. 

So what will we do in Florida, USA? Nothing, and more: We'll expand tourism as much as possible, create as many venues for transmission as we can, and offer the virus a whole new hunting ground of unvaccinated and poorly vaccinated fodder. 

Our vaccinated seniors are still at risk, even with three shots. I've seen breakthrough cases in seniors go bad. Were you aware that thousands of them are now travelling via cruises, too? They took this downturn in cases as a sign that it was okay to travel. 

Why haven't we learned? Our will to make and spend money appears to be more influential than the scientists and medical personnel's warnings. Lust, greed, avarice, one-upmanship, and gluttony - these are the sins of the American people. They will trade their lives and souls rather than wear a mask in public.

Do what you can to reduce viral load while and after being in public, because it stems to play a role in how quickly you can fight off infection.  That’s why masking makes such a difference in the case rates in, for example, Japan. Try to meet with people in largest airiest room possible. Try to wear glasses because the eyes are vulnerable as an entry to this infection. Wash your hands frequently, change out the mask frequently, too. If you find yourself feeling a bit crappy, keep distance from those immunocompromised people.  It’s possible someone to have Covid and isolate within the home and not transmit to others, and vaccinated the time sick is reduced further reducing the chance of transmission.  I’d recommend you get a booster six months after your second shot.

We’re not there yet. 

Like, I’m vaccinated and boosted (JJ+Moderna), and I have a work trip next week I can’t risk missing, so I’m probably not going anywhere more than picking up takeout not explicitly required of me until I leave on Wednesday morning, just to not risk it. I have to run into my office to get materials, but I’ll probably stay masked up just to be safe.

My friend asked her kid to wear one at school but he admitted to frequently 'forgetting it' at recess where they take them off being outside (he's five) and I think he only wore it part of the day most days (she didn't get too up in arms about this either and understood that he's just a five year old), she said though that once everyone had to wear them in school the 'forgetting it at recess' started to fall off because everyone was wearing them.

On a personal note, I think it is too soon in most places, and that at a certain point, if cases are low in the community and vaccine availability for children has been around long enough for them to all realistically have access to the vaccine (say about 2 months), then taking them off at school is a good idea. I'm thinking sometime after the holidays seems to make sense.

Personally I don't agree with the logic whatsoever.  In the US everyone (including kids) is advised a seasonal flu shot.  But that's besides the point.  If I can nearly guarantee my child will not be at any risk at all, no matter how minor, even if it's just having to quarantine out of school for 10 days, by giving them a painless jab, sign me up.  I believe Scott G said earlier this week that in the US there were about 3-5K pediatric hospitalizations.  Surely they make up a small percentage of all that got infected, yet if I can guarantee that won't be my kid, sign me up.  Also we're still at the infancy of understanding long term implications of ""long COVID"".  I have no doubt whatsoever that the vaccine will not have long term side effects, I can't say the same about a virus that has been shown to attack organs.  Lastly there is an issue of spread of the virus.  It's becoming clear that Delta is very difficult to contain.  So it'll take everyone doing their part for the greater good of society.  I'm happy that my family is doing their part.

BTW the argument of well I don't do A then I don't have to do B isn't solid logic IMHO.  Total risk is a summation of underlying risks.

For the most part they don’t want to learn. Providers and nurses can explain until they are blue in the face but if your patients trust YouTubers because misinformation is easier to digest there’s not much providers or nurses can do... When the truth is complicated and requires a real education to fully grasp. But the misinformation can be directed to anyone you end up with people believing the misinformation.

I actually agree completely. In order for people to learn a lesson, they have to see that people who rely on YouTube die at higher rates than people who do not. In the current system, that responsibility is outsourced to some government authority, which means that people can continue to be idiots and still receive good medical care; but the current crisis has exposed the shortcomings of such a model, which is that people don't value all the dirty work that goes into actually making sure their medicine doesn't kill them.

Think of it this way: if the government were to add guardrails on all cliffsides in the US, that wouldn't actually save lives, because people would simply become less careful around cliffs and spend more time there. For the same reason people's average savings as a fraction of income have dwindled since last century -- because there are fewer consequences to being broke. (Goes for major corporations too.

OK, I will give you an actual possible outcome, but one that isn't practiced because (well you'll see why in a sec). 

Total company seizure. IE, a company that has acted in bad faith and caused widespread harms they have tried to cover up is seized wholesale by the government, and the entire group of executives are removed to jail and it's run by the workers without an executive suite.

Oh, here's another one- percentage profits seizure. A company demonstrated to act in bad faith and cause harms in a court of law without undue pressure has their yearly profits confiscated as a percentage of the portion of the business that caused harms at its highest amount. 

Both of those are possible outcomes, but if you don't immediately see Mccarthy 2.0 going psycho I'd imagine you don't really spend much time in the political realm. 

As it stands a fine is the only way to punish an entire business, but mostly because of ""socialism "". 

Your idea is very silly, what we need to do is create rules that aren't arcane and insane. We need laws that protect the body politic from harms of bad actors, but enforcement mechanisms that have built-in grace for individuals and consistent application of the rules.

Because of a comment about the Singapore government giving citizens antigen rapid tests:

&gt; residents have been receiving a dozen or so of free Antigen Rapid Test kits

I found [this article](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/collection-of-free-antigen-rapid-test-kits-from-vending-machines-for-self-tests-given-emphasis-on-personal-responsibility/) from the Singapore Ministry of Health:

&gt; Question No. 2106

&gt; To ask the Minister for Health in view of the updated health protocols announced on 8 October 2021 emphasising personal responsibility, self-management and a greater reliance on antigen rapid tests (ART), whether the Government will allow individuals to collect free ART kits for their own regular testing, from designated vending machines, to supplement the free kits that will be distributed to all households from October to December 2021.

&gt; 
Answer

&gt; Each individual who receive a Health Risk Warning (HRW) can collect six Antigen Rapid Test (ART) kits from **vending machines** located islandwide. Workers on mandatory regular testing regimes are currently also provided with free kits by the government. To support individuals to self-test regularly, we had distributed six kits to each household from August to September, and are distributing another ten kits from October to December. Individuals who need more kits can purchase them from major retailers and e-commerce platforms.

Vending machines!

The US federal government [purchased $1 billion worth of rapid tests](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/10/06/biden-rapid-at-home-covid-tests/) that ""will increase the number of at-home tests to 200 million per month by December"" but I couldn't find anything about how they will be distributed. CVS?

Other Singapore covid19 infrastructure:

[**90%** use the official contact tracing app](https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/)

For those who don't have cell phones, a [physical token can be used instead](https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/img/download-token.svg).

AFAIK there is no US federal contact tracing app. According to  [this March 2021 Pew article](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2021/03/19/for-states-covid-contact-tracing-apps-privacy-tops-utility) about [half the states have apps](https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/data-visualizations/infographics/2021/03/contracttracing_v2.png?mw=910&amp;hash=661DD69F7E58B280AE094A605E05E627) but the article says their effectiveness is limited by over-emphasis on privacy -- and (in March) only 28 million people in the US (10% of adults) had installed them.

[Responding to COVID-19 With Tech \[in Singapore\]](https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/responding-to-covid-19-with-tech/)

&gt; The Government has progressively built up the digital infrastructure and engineering capabilities as the foundation of our Smart Nation.

It's an impressive list of web sites and apps, too long to summarize. One that stands out as very useful, easy to implement but unlikely to be acceptable in the US because of privacy concerns is an automated reporting system for [enforcing quarantine orders](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/412a096afb01ea68612e8c200ce234995f73f8a2/57324/images/shn-covid.jpg). Another is a web site where citizens can ""find the designated location, day and time to collect their allocation of masks.""

**TL;DR**: IMO Singapore is doing an excellent job of organizing its citizens and applying tech to fight covid19. By comparison the US is inept. Singapore isn't handicapped by privacy concerns.

Aside: [Lee Hsien Loong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong) is the prime minister of Singapore. ""In 1980, he earned a Master of Public Administration at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government."" I was in a class with him at the Kennedy School. It was a small class and the professor had a habit of conducting the class like a conversation with the most intelligent student in the room. That was Mr. Lee, in part because of his education before attending KSG. ""He studied in Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, graduating in 1974 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and a master's degree in computer science."" No wonder that Singapore has applied technology so effectively.

&gt; Besides you’re arguing against yourself.

How so?  I'm arguing that the vaccines can and do slow the spread *very substantially* and are extremely effective in preventing death.  If R0 for delta is ~6, then we need 84% of the population to have sterilizing immunity to reduce R0 to less than 1.  (Or we could have 100% of the population vaccinated with an 84% effective vaccine against the spread, or anything in between).  That is probably not possible, given waning immunity.

I am arguing that doesn't much matter.  Breakthrough infections suck, but the probability of one killing you is similar to the probability of the flu killing you.

Breakthrough infections aren't such a big deal that we should all need to permanently mask to prevent them.

&gt;Is hunter-harvested game meat safe to eat?
 
 &gt;There is no evidence that people can get COVID-19 by preparing or eating meat from an animal infected with SARS-CoV-2, including wild game meat hunted in the United States. 

&gt;However, hunters can get infected
with many other diseases when processing or eating game. Hunters should always practice good hygiene when processing animals by following these food safety recommendations:

&gt;• Do not allow contact between wildlife and domestic animals, including pets and hunting dogs.

&gt;• Do not harvest animals that appear sick or are found dead.

&gt;• Keep game meat clean and cool the meat down as soon as possible after harvesting the animal.

&gt;• Avoid cutting through the backbone and spinal tissues and do not eat the brains of wildlife.

&gt;• When handling and cleaning game:

 &gt;- Wear rubber or disposable gloves.

&gt;- Do not eat, drink, or smoke.

 &gt;• When finished handling and cleaning game:

 &gt;- Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.

&gt;- Clean knives, equipment, and surfaces that were in
contact with game meat with soap and water and
then disinfect them.

&gt;- Cook all game meat thoroughly (to an internal
temperature of 165 °F or higher).

&gt;- Check with your State wildlife agency regarding any
testing requirements for other diseases and for any specific instructions regarding preparing, transporting, and consuming game meat.",,,,1636498137,{},hjzv546,True,t3_qq5cie,False,False,t1_hjzbo1m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qq5cie/whitetailed_deer_found_to_be_huge_reservoir_of/hjzv546/,1636773061.0,18,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So 600 x $700 = $420,000 to prevent 35 hospitalizations. That's a cost of $12,000 per hospitalization prevented, not $700. And even though hospitalizations are more than $12,000, the government isn't paying for every single hospitalization. Many yes (via Medicare) but not all.

I'm not saying that this is a bad or ineffective drug or anything like that. Just that it's curious that the government just agrees to pay whatever the pharmaceutical company tells them to pay, without any pushback based on what was already given to them by the government. The federal government has the upper hand here. Who else is going to be contracting millions of doses?

That is in certain jurisdictions, such as the UK, anyone who dies within a set time frame after a COVID diagnosis is likely to be recorded as a COVID death and overworked hospital doctors have to review a stack of medical notes for deaths and decide on the cause of death. Other medical professionals have suggested that this will lead to some over counting and it is entirely possible that a component of negative excess mortality observed in some countries relates to this.

The stabilizing to slight increase in overall vaccinated population protection is encouraging no matter how you slice it. Either enough people are getting boosters as to keep the numbers high or the decline in protection isn't harsh enough to be the culprit of current waves.

I still feel really anxious about flying, due to reasons not having to do with COVID itself (severe fear of flying, health concerns that can be exacerbated during flying) but in ""normal"" times I'd absolutely make the flight.

I've been hearing from some friends that they will not be making trips to see family, due to them being international, but I'd be staying in the domestic US. Does it feel comfortable to be flying next month, in the current state of things? I'd be going from coast to coast.

First, it's not about 'tolerating' masks, it's about whether they are **necessary** based on the actual risk profile (not just hyperbolic generalized fear). 

The risk factors and demographic profiles of those that are susceptible to breakthrough infections are well known at this point. If you're relatively young and healthy, your risk of dying from a breakthrough infection is VERY low. Low enough that the overwhelming majority of people have nothing to worry about. 

If you're immunocompromised or elderly, then yes you should take other precautions to protect yourself. The issue comes when *everyone* is told to make extreme changes to their lives (as this article says, as strict as possible) when the vast majority of vaccinated people aren't really in any danger.
