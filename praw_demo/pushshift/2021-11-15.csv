Purpose of the Review  
Experiences of patients, families, healthcare workers and health systems during the COVID-19 pandemic and recent national focus on racial justice have forced a reconsideration of policies and processes of providing care in crisis situations when resources are scarce. The purpose of this review is to present recent developments in conceptualizing ethical crisis standards.  
  
Recent findings  
Several recent papers have raised concerns that ‚Äúobjective‚Äù scarce resource allocation protocols will serve to exacerbate underlying social inequities. Older adults and their formal and informal caregivers suffered from intersecting planning failures including lack of adequate stockpiling of personal protective equipment, failure to protect essential workers, neglect of long-term care facilities and homecare in disaster planning and de-prioiritization in triage algorithms.

Background/objective  
The COVID-19 epidemic is particularly serious in older adults. The symptomatology and epidemic profile remain little known in this population, especially in disabled oldest-old people with chronic diseases living in nursing homes. The objective of the present study was to comprehensively describe symptoms and chronological aspects of the diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a nursing home, among both residents and caregivers.  
  
Design  
Five-week retrospective cohort study.  
  
Setting  
A middle-sized nursing home in Maine-et-Loire, west of France.  
  
Participants  
Eighty-seven frail older residents (87.9 ¬± 7.2years; 71 % female) and 92 staff members (38.3 ¬± 11.7years; 89 % female) were included.  
  
Measurements  
Mass screening for SARS-CoV-2 was performed in both residents and staff. Attack rate, mortality rate, and symptoms among residents and staff infected with SARS-CoV-2 were recorded.  
  
Results  
The attack rate of COVID-19 was 47 % in residents (case fatality rate, 27 %), and 24 % in staff. Epidemic curves revealed that the epidemic started in residents before spreading to caregivers. Residents exhibited both general and respiratory signs (59 % hyperthermia, 49 % cough, 42 % polypnea) together with geriatric syndromes (15 % falls, 10 % altered consciousness). The classification tree revealed 100 % COVID-19 probability in the following groups: i) residents younger than 90 with dyspnea and falls; ii) residents older than 90 with anorexia; iii) residents older than 90 without anorexia but with altered consciousness. Finally, 41 % of staff members diagnosed with COVID-19 were asymptomatic.  
  
Conclusions  
The pauci-symptomatic expression of COVID-19 in older residents, together with the high prevalence of asymptomatic forms in caregivers, justifies mass screening in nursing homes, possibly prioritizing residents with suggestive combinations of clinical signs including dyspnea, falls, anorexia and/or altered consciousness.

Profound T-cell lymphopenia is the hallmark of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). T-cell proliferation is telomere length (TL) dependent and telomeres shorten with age. Older COVID-19 patients, we hypothesize, are, therefore, at a higher risk of having TL-dependent lymphopenia. We measured TL by the novel Telomere Shortest Length Assay (TeSLA), and by Southern blotting (SB) of the terminal restriction fragments in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 17 COVID-19 and 21 non-COVID-19 patients, aged 87 ¬± 8 (mean ¬± SD) and 87 ¬± 9 years, respectively. TeSLA tallies and measures single telomeres, including short telomeres undetected by SB. Such telomeres are relevant to TL-mediated biological processes, including cell viability and senescence. TeSLA yields 2 key metrics: the proportions of telomeres with different lengths (expressed in %) and their mean (TeSLA mTL), (expressed in kb). Lymphocyte count (109/L) was 0.91 ¬± 0.42 in COVID-19 patients and 1.50 ¬± 0.50 in non-COVID-19 patients (p &lt; .001). In COVID-19 patients, but not in non-COVID-19 patients, lymphocyte count was inversely correlated with the proportion of telomeres shorter than 2 kb (p = .005) and positively correlated with TeSLA mTL (p = .03). Lymphocyte count was not significantly correlated with SB mTL in either COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 patients. We propose that compromised TL-dependent T-cell proliferative response, driven by short telomere in the TL distribution, contributes to COVID-19 lymphopenia among old adults. We infer that infection with SARS-CoV-2 uncovers the limits of the TL reserves of older persons.",,,,1637067237,{},hkuiyu9,True,t3_qv74rt,False,True,t3_qv74rt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qv74rt/nexus_between_telomere_length_and_lymphocyte/hkuiyu9/,1637379795.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 across the world in  
2020, millions of people were reduced in their mobility to hinder  
the spread of the disease. The lockdown was particularly difficult  
for older adults, who were deemed ‚Äòvulnerable‚Äô because many felt  
unsafe leaving the house and often forced to self-isolate. In this  
paper, we interpret the lockdowns as a period of prolonged  
stillness: breaks from everyday practices, including withdrawnness,   
inefficiency, and retreat. We extend ideas of stillness by  
integrating the capability approach, which shows how the opportunities   
and challenges that arise from moments of stillness are  
dependent on a combination of individual agency and the role of  
structural or contextual factors. Using the accounts of thirty-eight  
older adults in the Netherlands and England, we show how the  
COVID-19 lockdowns established and encouraged different types  
of stillness which had differing impacts upon the older adults‚Äô  
lives. The effect of the prolonged stillness on these different areas  
of everyday life is based on individual agency and contextual  
factors, such as choosing to volunteer or having an adequate  
internet connection. Thus, our findings contribute to discussions  
around active ageing and demonstrate that slowing down, and  
spending more time at home, can provide respite from an otherwise   
active everyday life.",,,,1637065705,{},hkugdbc,True,t3_qv6pkd,False,True,t3_qv6pkd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qv6pkd/we_may_be_long_in_the_tooth_but_it_makes_us_tough/hkugdbc/,1637378359.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shortness of breath and sometimes, it would be more intense where my heart would just beat erratically.  The first episode happened when I was watching the new Conjuring horror film with my wife.   It honestly wasn't all that scary but my heart started pounding so uncomfortably that I checked myself into ER.  The 2nd episode was more serious.  I had EKG, blood tests, etc. etc. done.  I have no family history of heart disease and never had issues with my heart in the past and I'm in my 40s.  Now that it's been 6 months since the 2nd shot, I still feel the erratic heartbeats every so often but it's nowhere near as intense as the first few months.  I'm very scared of getting the booster because I'm worried those the constant heart arrhythmias would return.  I've heard the Moderna vaccine has a greater risk for heart inflammation so I'm very worried about getting either shot.  All those people who are scared of getting the shots -- I can honestly sympathize with them.  I was one of the earliest people to get the shots thinking it wouldn't affect me and that the side effects are exaggerated.  I'm not super old, never had issues w/ flu vaccines in the past, and have no underlying medical condition.

https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/long-term-study-children-covid-19-begins

In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, initial data suggested that children were less likely to suffer from severe cases of COVID-19 than older people. However, among the 6 million reported pediatric COVID-19 cases the United States, many children have experienced significant acute and long-term effects of the disease. Although increasing numbers of children are becoming eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, the lack of vaccine-derived protection for most children has made this age group especially vulnerable to infection. In addition, children can suffer from a suite of inflammatory symptoms, collectively called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), that can affect multiple organs and lead to severe illness. MIS-C can arise even when the child initially appeared to be asymptomatic for COVID.

‚ÄúAlthough we know that children are vulnerable to COVID-19, we still do not have a clear picture of how COVID-19 affects them in the long term,‚Äù said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. ‚ÄúIn adult patients, the long-term sequelae of COVID, including post-acute COVID-19, can significantly affect quality of life. Our investigations into the pediatric population will deepen our understanding of the public health impact that the pandemic has had and will continue to have in the months and years to come.‚Äù

The CDC has an epidemic cutoff: something like a 97.5% p score.  This is exceeded 1.3 weeks a year on average, but generally more like 3 consecutive weeks during bad flu seasons and never otherwise.   Currently roughly  every state in the country is above it, and has been for nearly every week since the pandemic began.

How much we want to spend stopping those 3 weeks every other year is a pretty simple value-of-life question, and in a rational world vaccination would be the simple answer.  But the current situation is not comparable to bi-annual epidemic flu at all.  Places that have anti-Delta NPI's have not had a Delta surge at all, and this isn't because they aren't going to have one - it's because they're all wearing masks.  They may be delaying it at too low of a hospitalization level, but the correct method of mitigation is to keep hospitals 25% full of Delta patients for as long as it takes to let everyone who wants to catch Delta.

This is a contradiction because the vaccine expiring means there's low demand due to no one taking it but you then claim we have no supply. I'm asking you to provide evidence this is true.

If we previously had a demand issue then demand would be up due to the boosters so why are they expiring?

‚ÄôJared Polis vowed Aug. 12 to take action before Colorado‚Äôs hospitals are overwhelmed with COVID patients. They are nearly overwhelmed.‚Äô  
In early August, as coronavirus infections and hospitalizations first began rising in Colorado following a summer lull, Gov. Jared Polis stood before reporters to answer questions about the worrying trend.  
Asked when he might consider reissuing a statewide mask mandate or other such aggressive virus-fighting actions, he was clear.  
‚ÄúWe will not overwhelm our hospitals,‚Äù he said then. ‚ÄúWe will take the steps necessary to avoid doing that.‚Äù  
Later, he added: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt wait until we‚Äôre overwhelming our hospitals. We watch the trend, and we act before we are overwhelming our hospitals.‚Äù  
Colorado is about to overwhelm its hospitals.  
When Polis made his vow, on Aug. 12, there were 514 people hospitalized in Colorado with COVID-19. On Wednesday, there were 1,431. The state‚Äôs intensive care units were 95% full.  
Epidemiologists expect more hospitalizations are on the way. The percentage of coronavirus tests coming back positive statewide is at nearly 10% ‚Äî double the goal for well-controlled transmission. In a handful of counties, test positivity tops 20%.  
Models now forecast that by the end of the year, if things remain on the same track, hundreds more coronavirus patients will need a hospital bed than the state currently has space for.  
Yet Polis has not given any indication that he intends to issue a mask mandate to slow the virus‚Äô spread and give hospitals breathing room. Some public health experts in the state believe it would help.  
‚ÄúI do think that a statewide indoor mask mandate, potentially, could help the system right now,‚Äù said Dr. Anuj Mehta, a critical care pulmonologist at Denver Health who has sometimes advised the state on policy during the pandemic. ‚ÄúI think a statewide mask mandate ‚Äî my personal opinion ‚Äî would augment our ability to address some of the acute surge issues.‚Äù  
Polis and state health leaders have taken other measures to address the spike in hospitalizations. They have called in federal teams to help out in overworked hospitals. They have issued orders on hospital staffing and on patient transfers designed to make sure every last bed in the state can be used.  
On Wednesday, Polis said the state would work to add 500 additional hospital beds in Colorado and would expand access to booster shots for the already vaccinated and to monoclonal antibody treatments for those in the early days of infection.  
He said his administration would work with cities and with the operators of event venues to encourage them to require vaccination for attendees of large, indoor events.  
‚ÄúWe know we need to do better; we are going to do better,‚Äù he said during a meeting with a group of his pandemic advisers. ‚ÄúAnd we are going to be working on policies that drive more Coloradans to get the life-saving vaccine.‚Äù  
If things get bad enough, he said the state may have to activate crisis triage protocols at hospitals.  
But Polis, in recent public statements, has repeatedly declined to entertain the idea of reissuing the kind of statewide public health orders on masking or social distancing that he issued earlier in the pandemic. He has insisted that now is a different time in the pandemic and there‚Äôs a question of fairness: About 80% of people in Colorado‚Äôs hospitals with COVID are unvaccinated; so why should the majority of Coloradans who are vaccinated have to suffer through more restrictions?

WASHINGTON ‚Äî The Food and Drug Administration is aiming to authorize booster doses of Pfizer-BioNTech‚Äôs coronavirus vaccine for all adults as early as Thursday, a move that would expand the number of Americans eligible for additional shots by tens of millions, according to people familiar with the agency‚Äôs plans.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‚Äôs independent committee of vaccine experts has scheduled a meeting for Friday to discuss data on the booster dose‚Äôs efficacy and safety. If both the F.D.A. and the C.D.C. sign off this week, they will have acted strikingly quickly ‚Äî a little more than a week after Pfizer asked for authorization of boosters for everyone 18 and older.

Under that scenario, any adult who received a second dose of the vaccine at least six months earlier would be officially eligible to get a booster as soon as this weekend. The F.D.A. is expected to rule without consulting its own expert panel, which has met frequently during the pandemic to review vaccine data and make a recommendation ahead of a regulatory decision.

Moderna is expected to soon submit its own request for the F.D.A. to broaden eligibility for its booster. But for now, every adult could get the Pfizer booster, according to people familiar with the planning.

The broad booster authorization has been viewed as something of a fait accompli for weeks. Some state and local officials have begun rolling out similar policies ahead of F.D.A. action ‚Äî responding to persistent virus case counts and the eagerness of many Americans to seek additional protection ahead of holiday gatherings.

New York City health officials on Monday encouraged all adults who want boosters to seek them out. Arkansas, California, Colorado and New Mexico have already moved to expand access.

Many Americans, regardless of where they live, have taken the matter into their own hands and sought out extra doses even if they do not officially qualify yet.

The F.D.A. in September downsized Pfizer-BioNTech‚Äôs request to fully approve booster doses for all adults, instead signing off on a more limited population, including those 65 and older, as well as adults with underlying medical conditions or those at risk because of their jobs.

At least 30 to 40 percent of vaccinated adults are still excluded from booster eligibility, according to some estimates.

More than 30 million people have gotten additional shots, with the number often outpacing the number of first shots given each day around the country. Booster doses were also authorized in October for everyone who received the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, and for vulnerable groups who received Moderna‚Äôs two-dose shot.

The C.D.C.‚Äôs gathering on Friday is scheduled to be briefer than recent meetings about Covid vaccines, just three hours, and is expected to be straightforward, one federal official familiar with the planning said, in part because of how far the nation‚Äôs booster campaign has already come. That would suggest a significant softening of opposition among public health experts since President Biden announced in August that he hoped to offer booster doses to all adults.

Mr. Biden wanted to start the campaign in late September, but his announcement was heavily criticized by public health experts, who said he was rushing federal scientists and regulators who had to decide whether the data supported such a move. Members of the F.D.A. and C.D.C. advisory committees have said they were uncomfortable with how quickly the administration wanted to offer booster shots to a large swath of Americans.

Some key regulators and outside advisers had been hesitant to endorse a sweeping booster campaign this early, arguing that effectiveness of the two-dose regimen, especially in preventing hospitalization and death, has held up strongly. One large study in New York of nearly nine million people has shown remarkable durability in the protection gained from all three federally authorized vaccines.

But more recently, federal regulators and scientists have said the evidence is increasingly clear that a reduction in vaccine efficacy against milder Covid cases, and in protective antibodies, has put Americans ‚Äî especially seniors and those with medical conditions ‚Äî at risk of harmful breakthrough infections as the Delta variant of the virus only gradually loosens its grip.

‚ÄúAntibodies decay with time. That‚Äôs not just a coronavirus vaccine story,‚Äù said Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the Precision Vaccines Program at Harvard‚Äôs Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital and a member of the F.D.A. advisory committee. ‚ÄúVaccines vary in the durability of the protective response. We are starting to see waning in other age groups as well.‚Äù

An Israeli study published in the scientific journal The Lancet in late October compared about 730,000 people who had received a booster dose in August or September with individuals who had received only two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at least five months earlier, finding that boosted recipients had a lower risk of hospitalization and severe disease. Those with booster shots were evaluated between one week and nearly two months after their third dose.

The initial doses were given very close together with no time for affinity maturation.  Boosters may be much more durable.  Many vaccines are given on a schedule spaced months apart.

This is absolutely misinformation and you should edit your comment to reflect that.  Being vaccinated reduces your chances of getting infected‚Äîwhich prevents you from spreading the disease.  Being vaccinated reduces the length of your infection if you do get a breakthrough infection, making you infectious for less long, which reduces your chances of spreading the disease.  And being vaccinated people with breakthroughs have less culturable virus present, even at the same Ct value (viral load), which makes them less infectious.

&gt; Wearing a mask has been proven to prevent the spread of disease. 

Masking does reduce the spread of covid, somewhat.  **But it is less effective at that than vaccination** and it is absolutely bonkers/nonsense/crazy to assert that masking works to stop the spread but vaccination does not. 

And yes, I am absolutely aware that the effect is multiplicative, so both masking and being vaccinated is better than just doing one thing.

But if you had to pick between being in a room with 20 unmasked, vaccinated people or 20 masked, unvaccinated people, you‚Äôd be wise to pick the room with the unmasked, vaccinated people.

&gt;  Wearing a mask, especially as a customer, is a trivial inconvenience

As a customer, I agree with you.  But that isn‚Äôt all public indoor spaces.  I would love to not have to mask at my gym *where every member is fully vaccinated*.

I had extremely predictable cycles for years that went utterly crazy awful horrific immediately after vaccine #2. 

For context, the years of endo training made labor pretty easy. Two babies, I was walking and talking and cracking jokes through labor until the end. You learn to deal. But the pain I was in with the cycles after my second vaccine had me hardly able to shuffle to the bathroom. Every step was torture, I thought I would pass out.

There aren't really any protocols in schools. My mum works in a primary school, which is ages 5-11. Masks are not required for anyone. Tests were done twice a week for staff but now not sure if being asked or enforced. Ventilation is horrendous in our schools as 99% will not have air condition and they're going to be cold now so it's unlikely windows will be open. 

The biggest age group for cases in UK has been 10-14 year olds. We recommended vaccines for 12-15 year olds some 3/4 months after saying no, and we've just recommended second doses.

We got a lot of stuff right in the UK, and vaccine uptake was much better than anticipated, but it has been sold as the end of the pandemic if we get our vaccines.

&gt; The Salzburg state clinics announced on Tuesday that a triage team was being put together because treatment of all patients according to the applicable standards could soon no longer be guaranteed. According to the spokesman for the clinics, the team will in future advise who can still be treated in intensive care and who cannot.

&gt; With more than 1,500 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants, Salzburg currently has the highest seven-day incidence among the Austrian federal states. Upper Austria follows closely behind with a value of more than 1400. Austria's intensive care physicians therefore called for a short lockdown for the general population in these two regions on Tuesday. The situation is ""very, very tense,"" said Walter Hasibeder, president of the √ñGARI professional association.

&gt; √ñVP against night exit restrictions

&gt; The conservative √ñVP of Federal Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg has vehemently opposed the initiative of Health Minister Wolfgang M√ºckstein (Greens) to introduce nationwide nocturnal exit restrictions in the past few days. Instead, the conservative Chancellor Party is relying on the lockdown for unvaccinated people, which has been in force in Austria since Monday. M√ºckstein wants to reassess the situation on Wednesday.

&gt; In response to the call for help from the clinic operator with its four hospitals, Salzburg's head of state Wilfried Haslauer (√ñVP) announced relief measures.

We don't know the falloff over time, but yes, there will be some falloff if the body doesn't see a repeat vaccination/infection in some time.  The more repetitions the body sees, the less the antibody priming that is the point of vaccines degrades over time.

The vaccines themselves are destroyed by the body as a mechanism of how vaccines work.  The mRNA vaccines are slightly different in that they cause the body to briefly produce the vaccine itself, but they're still gone in a very limited time.  This is why the ""long term effects about vaccine"" arguments are spurious -- the long term effects are that the body has a memory of the vaccine antigen.  The vaccine antigens are destroyed as part of making that memory.  There aren't long term effects because there isn't anything left to cause long term effects.

The study also finds that Hispanic/Latino and Asian Americans have lower levels of vaccine hesitancy than White and Black folks.  

[Here is another study from the Kaiser Foundation](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-profile-of-the-unvaccinated/) that shows that the factors most associated with vaccine resistance are low levels of education, being younger, and being Republican.  If you read the article, pay close attention to the discussion of the differences between the groups that says they will ""definitely NOT get"" the vaccine, and the group that says they want to ""wait and see"" if it it safe and effective.  The ""definitely not"" group is predominantly white and Republican, while the ""wait and see"" group is Black, Latino and politically mixed.

But none of this is surprising in the least for people familiar with the research literature on race/ethnicity and trust of the medical industry.  There is a well documented history of discrimination and ethical failure in the way health care and medical research treats people of color, poor folks, women, prisoners, etc.  I would say the one thing missing from this conversation is the intersection of race/ethnicity and class.  It is kind of hinted at in the use of ""educational level,"" but I think in this case education is a poor substitute for class.  The same legitimate mistrust of medicine (due to historical mistreatment) that underlies Black and Latino resistance to vaccines probably plays a role in lower income and working class white resistance.  But pulling mistrust of medicine apart from the influence of political commitments (Republicanism) and vaccine misinformation (from both the left and the right of the political spectrum) among lower income White folks is very difficult.",,,,1637081432,{},hkvepkv,False,t3_qt3bx7,False,True,t1_hklyavb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qt3bx7/as_infections_rise_the_san_joaquin_valley_becomes/hkvepkv/,1637396263.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,Sorroww0lf-,,,[],,,,text,t2_8i06mvzt,False,False,[],"Aaron went on Pat's podcast, and said what he felt about his own personal opinions on the matter. About how he personally sees it, and told people, ""don't listen to me, or base your care off of what I do or did, but instead talk to your doctor, and do what is best for you. I'm sorry, but if you didn't get that from what he said, then your comprehension level is low, imo. He also didn't just decide one day, ""hey, I know what's best or better for everyone."" He isn't anti vaccine/vaccination, in the broad sense of the word. In the past, way before Covid-19 was even a thing, Aaron had lightly discussed having some pretty intense allergies, to different things. 

You are acting like Aaron Rodgers wanted to openly discuss and push an anti vaccination agenda from the beginning. He didn't. He doesn't. It's why he didn't just come out from the beginning and say he wasn't vaccinated and give his personal reasons for coming to that decision. He knew or at least speculated, that you and everyone else that is and has attacked him, would do exactly what you are doing. Every single time anyone belittles him, or gets mad at him, it is proving his initial speculation, to be true. Only further enforcing his feelings about the topic.

Let me ask you this. Did you look into the vaccines prior to taking them? Or did you just get vaccinated without weighing any possible risk? And so I'm clear. I'm pro vaccine. I've been voluntarily getting a flu vaccine every year for the past 22 years. And when the mRNA vaccines came out, I was excited to get vaccinated against Covid. But I did also look at different studies, consulted, not only my doctor, but also some friends I have in the epidemiology field, to better understand the science behind them, to better weigh the risks of getting vaccinated versus not getting vaccinated and getting Covid. After looking at those personal risks, and the risk associated with others, due to me working in a hospital, and decided I was willing to risk the low chance of negative side effects of getting one of the mRNA vaccines, I got vaccinated. But unlike Aaron Rodgers, and other people, not the majority of people, but of a minority of people, I've had no history of being allergic to any of the ingredients in the vaccines. Which certainly made my decision to get vaccinated against Covid much easier.

Humans, as a whole, are extremely similar, biologically speaking, but pretty much every human on this planet, does in fact have different interactions with different compounds/elements. Some people are completely allergy free, and others are highly allergic to a slew of things. I have family members and friends that can't handle peanuts or latex. Me on the other hand love a good pb&amp;j, and have no issue wearing certain gloves or eating bananas. We as humans, are effected by different things, differently.  And an inability to accept this truth, is a short coming of yours, and many other humans out there.

And just like you have the, ""right,"" to share your disagreement with Aaron Rodgers' opinions, or my understanding of his position on the matter. He has the right to his opinions, and I have the right to voice an understanding of why I believe he came to have those opinions.

&gt;Video of the incident, from a home security camera, circulated widely on Chinese social media on Saturday. It showed two workers in white hazmat suits pursuing the dog in an unoccupied apartment. It yelps as one worker swings at it with a metal bar. Then it is briefly caught in the legs of a table as it flees to another room off camera.

&gt;The dog‚Äôs death was not shown, but state media reports later said it had been culled. The vague wording of the Xinzhou district government‚Äôs statement Saturday, which said workers had ‚Äúdecontaminated‚Äù the animal though there was no indication it had been infected with the coronavirus, helped fuel the outcry.

&gt;The pet‚Äôs owner or owners could not be reached for comment. According to an account on the Twitter-like platform Weibo that first shared the video, the owners had been sent to hotel quarantine along with other residents of their neighborhood in the city of Shangrao, in Jiangxi Province. Jiangxi is experiencing a small-scale coronavirus outbreak, with more than 70 cases reported since the end of last month.

&gt;Quarantined residents were asked to leave their apartments so local government workers could disinfect them. But unlike in other Chinese cities, which allowed owners to take pets into quarantine or even arranged boarding, no preparations for animals appear to have been made.

&gt;It was unclear why the dog was killed. In other parts of China, a small number of animals have been killed as part of the pandemic response, including three cats that were euthanized in the northern city of Harbin in September after they were found to be infected with the coronavirus. Before the pandemic, some Chinese cities carried out large-scale campaigns to cull unregistered dogs and cats.

&gt;The online anger over the corgi‚Äôs treatment touched on broader concerns about draconian enforcement of China‚Äôs ‚Äúzero Covid‚Äù policy, which has led to repeated lockdowns in some cities, and about the abuse of animals. China has no law against animal cruelty, despite the growing popularity of pet ownership.

&gt;This kind of behavior is really chilling,‚Äù Zhang Junyang, a film director, wrote on Weibo.

&gt;‚ÄùIn the current epidemic situation, the grass roots personnel are indeed working very hard,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúBut why can‚Äôt we have a little warmth when dealing with domestic pets? Why can‚Äôt it be more humane?‚Äù

&gt;State media outlets sought to assuage anger over the episode, calling it an isolated mistake that should not reflect poorly on the national pandemic response.

&gt;‚ÄùObservers admit the imperfect behavior of the anti-epidemic staffer, but they have also called for more understanding toward the front-line workers who are working tirelessly to curb the epidemic,‚Äù read one report in the Global Times newspaper, which is owned by the ruling Communist Party.

&gt;The virus has spread unevenly in Spain in recent weeks, and the infection rates in the Basque region and neighboring Navarra are now more than twice the national average. Lawmakers in the worst-hit regions are leading a nationwide debate over whether Spain should reintroduce more restrictions to prevent a serious Covid-19 resurgence this winter.

&gt;The Basque regional government said that all areas in which the infection rate exceeds 150 cases per 100,000 inhabitants should suspend mass events and other gatherings, in particular those where food and drinks were served and where social distancing could not be guaranteed. The region‚Äôs 14-day average infection rate climbed just above 180 per 100,000 inhabitants this weekend, compared with a nationwide rate on Monday of 82 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, according to Spain‚Äôs health ministry.

&gt;The regional government said it would also ask the Basque judiciary to mandate proof of Covid-19 vaccination for people seeking to enter restaurants and nightclubs.

&gt;‚ÄùWe are not doing well,‚Äù Gotzone Sagardui, the regional health minister, told a news conference, adding that the virus was again spreading ‚Äúwith a worrying speed of growth.‚Äù

&gt;Spain‚Äôs health regulators lowered the country‚Äôs status to ‚Äúlow risk‚Äù in October after a plunge in the nationwide infection rate from a summer peak of over 700 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in late July. That improvement was largely attributed to a successful vaccination campaign, and 79 percent of the population is now fully vaccinated.

&gt;Booster shots are now being given to people who are over 70 or living in nursing homes, and Spain‚Äôs government is expected to soon offer vaccinations to children under 12.

&gt;At the same time, however, the country‚Äôs pandemic response has recently involved a patchwork of restrictions put in place by regional governments, which are responsible for health care.

&gt;I√±igo Urkullu, the Basque region‚Äôs leader, has led a push to require vaccination in certain business sectors ‚Äî as has happened sweepingly in Italy and some other countries ‚Äî and has urged Spain‚Äôs central government to set nationwide rules.

&gt;Ximo Puig, the leader of the eastern region of Valencia, also said recently that his government was considering whether to require vaccination passes for entry into some venues.

&gt;The judgment, which is subject to court approval, is the first of its kind nationwide and is in line with a California ‚Äúright to know‚Äù law that was designed to keep workers safe during the pandemic, according to a news release from the attorney general‚Äôs office.

&gt;Under the arrangement, Amazon must also tell its warehouse workers within a day about the exact number of new Covid-19 cases in their workplaces, ensure that notifications adequately inform workers of the company‚Äôs disinfection and safety plans, tell health officials about new cases and submit to monitoring by the attorney general‚Äôs office regarding its Covid-19 notifications.

&gt;‚ÄùWe‚Äôre glad to have this resolved,‚Äù Barbara Agrait, a spokeswoman for Amazon, said in an emailed statement. She said the attorney general‚Äôs office ‚Äúfound no substantive issues with the safety measures in our buildings,‚Äù only with technical aspects of how the company communicated broadly with its workers.

&gt;‚ÄùWe‚Äôve worked hard from the beginning of the pandemic to keep our employees safe and deliver for our customers ‚Äî incurring more than $15 billion in costs to date ‚Äî and we‚Äôll keep doing that in months and years ahead,‚Äù Ms. Agrait said.

&gt;A complaint filed in Superior Court in Sacramento maintained that Amazon‚Äôs actions had prevented employees and the public from gaining full access to information regarding Covid-19 cases.

&gt;The state‚Äôs attorney general, Rob Bonta, said that such information was crucial for workers making difficult decisions regarding their health in the pandemic.

&gt;‚ÄùAmazon‚Äôs practices led to workers not knowing if they had been potentially exposed to two, 20 or even 200 cases of Covid-19,‚Äù he said at a news conference on Monday. ‚ÄúThis left many workers understandably terrified and powerless to make informed decisions to protect themselves and to protect their loved ones.‚Äù

&gt;No corporation is too big to follow the law,‚Äù Mr. Bonta said. ‚ÄúThis is a huge win for the safety and health of Amazon‚Äôs tens of thousands of warehouse workers, their families and our communities throughout this state.‚Äù

&gt;He said that the judgment sent a clear message that businesses must comply with the law, and that it was particularly important as the busy holiday season approached.

After a pared-down celebration last year, the longtime tradition of the ball drop at midnight will return to the city ‚Äúat full strength,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe want to welcome all those hundreds of thousands of folks, but everyone needs to be vaccinated,‚Äù Mr. de Blasio said during a news conference. ‚ÄúJoin the crowd, join the joy, join a historic moment as New York City provides further evidence to the world that we are 100 percent back.‚Äù

Attendees who are unable to provide proof of vaccination because of a disability will have to show that they received a negative coronavirus test within 72 hours of the event, and children younger than 5 will have to be accompanied by someone with proof of vaccination.

The announcement comes as Mr. de Blasio is preparing for his successor, Eric Adams, to take over as the next mayor of New York City, and the ball drop will coincide with Mr. de Blasio‚Äôs final day in office. That will leave any fallout from the event in the hands of Mr. Adams, who will be inaugurated on Jan. 1, 2022.

Several public health experts have warned that with the constantly changing nature of the coronavirus, it is difficult to predict where the city might be in terms of cases by the end of the year.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to be perfect,‚Äù said Denis Nash, a professor of epidemiology for the City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy. ‚ÄúWe have to assume there will be people with Covid mixing among the revelers outdoors.‚Äù

Nor is the risk limited to Times Square. Attendees will also have to consider what happens on the way to the ball drop, with people going in and out of nearby bars and restaurants to eat, get warm and use the restroom.

And with some major restrictions against international travelers recently eased by the United States, the ball drop is likely to attract partygoers from around the country and the world, drawing together people from areas of both lower and higher rates of the virus.

Danielle Ompad, an associate professor of epidemiology at New York University, said she would still urge attendees to exercise caution when deciding whether or not to go.

‚ÄúI understand that people are so over this pandemic, and people are getting vaccinated and our vaccination rates are high,‚Äù Ms. Ompad said. ‚ÄúBut I still think it is important to be cautious.‚Äù

Wafaa El-Sadr, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University, expressed similar concerns: ‚ÄúI would say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll wait for another year and choose to watch it from home.‚Äô‚Äù

Other major cities around the world have nixed their New Year‚Äôs Eve celebrations. In October, London‚Äôs mayor said that the city‚Äôs end-of-year fireworks display would be canceled and replaced with a different kind of celebration, while Amsterdam canceled its celebrations this week in response to a surge in cases.

Munich has also canceled its celebrated Christmas market, which was set to be held from next Monday through Christmas Eve. ‚ÄúThe dramatic situation in our hospitals and the exponentially increasing infection figures leave me no other choice,‚Äù the city‚Äôs mayor, Dieter Reiter, told reporters on Tuesday.

&gt;Ngati Toa, the Maori tribe that owns the legal rights to that haka, on Monday called for them to stop. ‚ÄúWe insist that protesters stop using our taonga immediately,‚Äù Taku Parai, a senior member of Ngati Toa, said in a statement, using the Maori word for a treasure. ‚ÄúWe do not support their position.‚Äù

&gt;A law passed by the New Zealand government in 2014 recognized the tribe, or iwi, as the custodians of the haka. Ka Mate dates back to 1820 and recounts the story of the heroic escape of Te Rauparaha, a chieftain, from capture by a rival tribe. Ngati Toa has previously spoken out against its misuse for commercial gain.

&gt;Historically, pandemics have posed a particular threat to Maori, New Zealand‚Äôs Indigenous people. The 1918 flu pandemic devastated Maori communities, killing Maori at a rate seven times that of the wider population, while in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the rate of infection for Maori was twice that of white New Zealanders.

&gt;The present coronavirus pandemic has again hit Maori disproportionately. As of March, half of those in New Zealand who had ended up in intensive care because of the virus had been Maori, despite their making up only 14 percent of the population. The vaccination rate among Maori lags behind the rest of the country, with 77 percent of those eligible having received at least one dose of a vaccine, compared to 90 percent in the wider population.

&gt;In light of this history, and of the ancestors they have lost to these illnesses, the tribe has taken a proactive role in vaccinating its members against the coronavirus, said Helmut Modlik, a senior member of Ngati Toa.

&gt;‚ÄùWe are absolutely clear that the Covid-19 vaccine is the best protection we have available to us, and we are committed to supporting our whƒÅnau to get vaccinated as soon as possible,‚Äù Dr. Modlik added. He called for protesters to use a different haka, of which there are many.

The entire premise of vaccine equity was nonsense to begin with. It was somewhat relevant when the discussion about boosters first came up in June back when production was still a bottleneck, but by the time the decision was made in September it was a moot point. Distribution had become the bottleneck for vaccines, not production. I posted at length about this [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/qa328n/top_virologist_says_delta_defeated_predicts_6/hh0yzyf/) a month ago, and it is even more true today than it was last month. Global doses administered have risen significantly in the past month *because* of boosters being administered in the EU, US, and other large developed countries. 

In the past several weeks, we crossed a milestone: more than half of the world's adult (18+) population has already been fully vaccinated. Every incremental percent of vaccination after that point will become incrementally harder; as an example, the US peaked in vaccine administration long before we reached 50% of the eligible population fully vaccinated. 

As much as the WHO likes to pretend that the world is just waiting with sleeves rolled up for a shot, the reality is that they are not. There are a few large countries that still have some supply bottlenecks, especially for second dose delivery, but they are the exception and not the rule. Africa could use more vaccines, but for the places that need them the most, COVID is hardly a big issue. In a region where 65%+ of the population is under 30 and far more people are dying from traditional diseases (diarrheal diseases, malaria, ...), COVID doesn't even register as a blip. Not saying that we should ignore these countries, but getting a COVID vaccine isn't high on someone's priority list when their kids are hungry and they don't have clean water. 

Of course, it's easy for the WHO to lobby for vaccine delivery to lower income countries because it's easier to ship some vaccines over (paid for by other people) than actually support the development of clean water infrastructure or deal with the local in-country political ramifications of educating women and providing birth control. But that doesn't mean that the developed world should needlessly allow disease to spread in its population because keeping track of COVID vaccines delivered to countries that barely want them is deemed a priority.",,,,1637077481,{},hkv4t5i,False,t3_qv5j1y,False,False,t1_hkv29kn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qv5j1y/fauci_says_eligible_americans_should_by_all_means/hkv4t5i/,1637391251.0,20,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uh no. Roughly half of all white Michigan residents are not yet vaccinated with at least one dose (assuming this is what you meant by antivaxxers.) Hispanics are also roughly half so are negligible for the purposes of proving you wrong. About 62% of black MI residents are not yet vaccinated, however as a percentage of total state population, white residents account for \~75% of the population while black residents account for 14%, (with hispanics at \~5%.) 

I'll walk you through the math since you apparently couldn't be bothered to do it prior to making a hilariously false assumption that the ""vast majority"" of antivaxxers are black and Hispanic (which apparently are monolithic and can't possibly support trump according to you.)

.5 x 75 = 37.5% of the state population are white antivaxxers. 

.62 x 15 = 9.3% of the state population are black antivaxxers.

Technically, according to the states dashboard, about 25% of those reporting vaccine coverage did not list race so it's not quite correct to list these as a percentage of the total population, but it doesn't really affect the proportional make up of those not yet vaccinated so the point still stands: **The vast majority of anti-vaxxers in Michigan are not black and hispanic, they are white.** And yes, they disproportionally self-identify as republicans according to KFF.",,,,1637088496,{},hkvwwke,False,t3_qut1tf,False,False,t1_hktub8r,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qut1tf/michigan_reports_21034_new_covid19_cases_95/hkvwwke/,1637405483.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

*No*, vaccines expire because time moves forward and they don‚Äôt last forever. There are many reasons why they may not be getting into peoples arms, none of which I‚Äôve made any claims about. 

Not only do vaccines expiring not require a surplus but to have a shortage *actually requires* demand. If no one wanted them then how would there be a shortage? 

Also I do not claim we have no supply. That‚Äôs just your own inference of what you think I mean. When I tell you it‚Äôs not what I mean you just ignore me. 

&gt; I'm asking you to provide evidence this is true. Because either we somehow aren't getting new vaccine shipments(indicating a supply issue) or it's expiring on shelves(indicating a demand one).

You‚Äôre asking me to provide evidence for your inference, not what I actually said. I‚Äôm not going to do that.

The problem here is that this is somewhat intentionally deceptive. We have massive data sets showing that children are less likely to suffer from severe cases of COVID-19 than older people. That has not only never changed, we have far more data indicating it.

There are certainly negative possible impacts on children from COVID. But we've have several years of data now.

Basically, they're doing two things at once right now:

* Testing how well a booster dose of the original vaccine works against Delta (and Beta)
* Testing how well a booster dose of a new Delta-specific vaccine works against Delta

The results so far seem to show that a booster of the original vaccine is working very well, possibly as well as the updated one is.  So the difference in effectiveness may not be significant enough to switch.

Another point the article raises is that manufacturing is still a challenge, and switching over manufacturing could cause interruptions that reduce output, which could cause more problems than an updated vaccine would solve.

 However you may be sitting close to an infected person and the HEPA filter obviously only has an effect on the air that actually goes through the HEPA filter.  Most airplanes have HEPA filters.  However they usually are not  on when boarding/unboarding the plane,  and CO2 measurements in jetways during boarding suggest that there isn't enough ventilation there either.  

 A MERV13 filter, will remove perhaps about 1/2 of the virus containing particles but has less pressure drop so is compatible with most HVAC systems as built today.  A house, office, etc... could probably do a good job if it upgraded all the HVAC filters to MERV13s and supplemented this with portable floor units of HEPA filters in areas of concern.  

A good metric is to get at least 4 air changes per hour (ACH) calculated from the HEPA filter's listed CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) at a tolerable level of noise from the filters.  Usually this is not the highest fan setting so be realistic.  4 ACH will usually eliminate most airborne spread from people 2-3 meters (6 to 10 feet) apart.  If the room air is well mixed (which is usually not a perfect but not a terrible guestimate), each air change will reduce the virus in the air by about 68% (1-1/e) - but milage will vary slightly.",,,,1637090499,{},hkw1zdh,False,t3_qve40y,False,True,t1_hkvuhmz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qve40y/research_reveals_that_air_filtration_eliminates/hkw1zdh/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,9a80a72cd6e41e8113be3623b86be7b3b5b869ba,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1637090510.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

I would note the CDC does not require any conditions to be diagnosed to qualify. Here are the CDC guidelines with some highlights:

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html)

&gt;As we are learning more about COVID-19 every day, this list does not include all medical conditions that place a person at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Mental health conditions
&gt;
&gt; Having mood disorders, *including* depression

(I personally read this as the CDC has not compiled a comprehensive list of mood disorders that qualify, nor even a comprehensive list of *conditions* that qualify)

and from the CDC provided outlink on depression:

[https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression)

&gt;If you have been experiencing some of the following signs and symptoms most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks, you may be suffering from depression:
&gt;
&gt; Persistent sad, anxious, or ‚Äúempty‚Äù mood
&gt;
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Not everyone who is depressed experiences every symptom. Some people experience only a few symptoms

Other things to keep in mind:

&gt;Being a current **or former** cigarette smoker

What is a ""former"" smoker? The CDC purposefully does not define this.

These qualifiers are written *extremely* broadly.

I believe if a person can argue they qualify based on this, they qualify; it's not lying.

Which was the only vaccine he could take, since he's allergic to 2 out of the 4 ingredients, in the mRNA vaccines, that the experts, including the CDC, say an allergy to even one of them means, you shouldn't take the mRNA vaccines. And either those specialists couldn't convince him that the risk of him having an adverse reaction to the J&amp;J vaccine was super low, or he saw the reports of blood clotting, and simply decided any risk, was, ""too much."" And to be fair, blood clots, even when manageable for regular people, can be harder to manage for top athletes. Especially, when they play high contact sports.

I wish people would just let this go. The world of sports media, blew this way out of proportion, because he misled them in an interview. Of course, there were NFL insiders who knew the truth the moment he said, ""I'm immunized,"" but decided to keep it to themselves. Oddly enough, deciding to wait until he tested positive. 

And what did the timing for the reporting matter, you may ask? Well, the insiders, clearly didn't give a shit about him doing pressers unmasked. So what could it have been? Hmm? You Know something, we basically stopped hearing about? The Gruden/WFT scandal. A scandal, in which NFL insiders were discussing what should be reported, with the Owner of the Washington Football Team. Interesting coincidence, am I right? It also completely eclipsed the guy in Vegas driving 156 and killing a woman, while intoxicated.

The sports media world has always, ""used,"" Rodgers for a punching bag, that is great for getting clicks/ad revenue. He spent years saying nothing, keeping his personal thoughts on a wide range of topics to himself. So the media, basically just made shit up, assuming his motives/feelings, and reporting on those assumptions. And the assumptions of people that were either related to him, or past teammates. Then Rodgers met Pat McAfee, they became friends, and he started doing his podcast every Tuesday, during the football season. This has seemingly, only pissed off the sports media talking heads, even more. So now, even though Rodgers shares his thoughts with the public, using Pat's podcast, the talking heads still just take what he says, and continue to make endless assumptions.

That hasn't changed. Most people (who are younger and in moderately decent health) are going to be just fine if they catch it. When we keep beating our chests and screaming that ""YOU'RE 10X MORE LIKELY TO BE HOSPITALIZED!"" the people who are aware of the fact that it's probably not going to be a big deal if they catch it just shake their heads at us.

Because most anti vaxers aren't bad people. They can see the value of helping their neighbor's. But they dig their heels in and roll their eyes when we act like they are gonna die if they don't get a vaccine.

Watch Aaron‚Äôs ‚Äúapology‚Äù interview on Pat McAfee https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGQ2fcaf70w 

And an interview where he has basic control of the narriative so he just tosses his opinions on while seeming like he‚Äôs down to earth https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbjObpXCAfI

He tries to come off like he has a special understanding. The apology isn‚Äôt all that sincere. When directly questioned he deflects because the blame isn‚Äôt really on him and he won‚Äôt answer the question.

A lot of Aaron‚Äôs original central argument in the original interview was he had deeper understanding (like his 500 page paper to the NFL), deserves special treatment, didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, wants you to accept his understanding.

Aaron obviously isn‚Äôt running a cult but compare some of this to Steve Hassan‚Äôs BITE model.

The study this video is about says itself:

&gt; Clinical studies have indicated that patients with severe COVID‚Äì19 exhibit delayed and weak adaptive immune responses; however, the mechanism by which SARS‚ÄìCoV‚Äì2 impedes adaptive immunity remains unclear. Here, by using an in vitro cell line, we report that the SARS‚ÄìCoV‚Äì2 spike protein significantly inhibits DNA damage repair, which is required for effective V(D)J recombination in adaptive immunity. Mechanistically, we found that the spike protein localizes in the nucleus and inhibits DNA damage repair by impeding key DNA repair protein BRCA1 and 53BP1 recruitment to the damage site.

So, this is rather about people with severe Covid, which the vaccines protect against, and not a bashing of mrna vaccines. The jump to this conclusion seems disingenious. Furthermore there seem more problems with this study, i link to this discussion:

&gt;Importance  Short-term and long-term persistent postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) have not been systematically evaluated. The incidence and evolution of PASC are dependent on time from infection, organ systems and tissue affected, vaccination status, variant of the virus, and geographic region.

&gt;Objective  To estimate organ system‚Äìspecific frequency and evolution of PASC.

&gt;Evidence Review  PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, the World Health Organization Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease, and CoronaCentral databases were searched from December 2019 through March 2021. A total of 2100 studies were identified from databases and through cited references. Studies providing data on PASC in children and adults were included. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for abstracting data were followed and performed independently by 2 reviewers. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. The main outcome was frequency of PASC diagnosed by (1) laboratory investigation, (2) radiologic pathology, and (3) clinical signs and symptoms. PASC were classified by organ system, ie, neurologic; cardiovascular; respiratory; digestive; dermatologic; and ear, nose, and throat as well as mental health, constitutional symptoms, and functional mobility.

&gt;Findings  From a total of 2100 studies identified, 57 studies with 250‚ÄØ351 survivors of COVID-19 met inclusion criteria. The mean (SD) age of survivors was 54.4 (8.9) years, 140‚ÄØ196 (56%) were male, and 197‚ÄØ777 (79%) were hospitalized during acute COVID-19. High-income countries contributed 45 studies (79%). The median (IQR) proportion of COVID-19 survivors experiencing at least 1 PASC was 54.0% (45.0%-69.0%; 13 studies) at 1 month (short-term), 55.0% (34.8%-65.5%; 38 studies) at 2 to 5 months (intermediate-term), and 54.0% (31.0%-67.0%; 9 studies) at 6 or more months (long-term). Most prevalent pulmonary sequelae, neurologic disorders, mental health disorders, functional mobility impairments, and general and constitutional symptoms were chest imaging abnormality (median [IQR], 62.2% [45.8%-76.5%]), difficulty concentrating (median [IQR], 23.8% [20.4%-25.9%]), generalized anxiety disorder (median [IQR], 29.6% [14.0%-44.0%]), general functional impairments (median [IQR], 44.0% [23.4%-62.6%]), and fatigue or muscle weakness (median [IQR], 37.5% [25.4%-54.5%]), respectively. Other frequently reported symptoms included cardiac, dermatologic, digestive, and ear, nose, and throat disorders.

&gt;Conclusions and Relevance  In this systematic review, more than half of COVID-19 survivors experienced PASC 6 months after recovery. The most common PASC involved functional mobility impairments, pulmonary abnormalities, and mental health disorders. These long-term PASC effects occur on a scale that could overwhelm existing health care capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.",,,,1637080610,{},hkvclyo,False,t3_quoboq,False,True,t1_hkvbyx2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/quoboq/50_percent_of_people_who_survive_covid19_face/hkvclyo/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,61ede6c60b1e22fae8626c6190d78042317231a4,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1637080622.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

&gt;A government program will offer no-fault payouts for factors including extended periods of missed work, and the minimum amount for such claims is 5,000 Australian dollars ($3,670). Applicants will be expected to provide medical bills and other evidence, and the registration surge has already occurred a month before an online portal launches.

&gt;In a country where nearly 85 percent of residents over 16 have been fully vaccinated against the virus, the Australia‚Äôs main medical regulator has recorded 78,880 adverse events said to be linked to Covid vaccination. That amounts to just 0.21 percent of the nearly 38 million doses given to over 18 million people in the country by early November.

&gt;Most of those adverse events involved mild side effects like headache, nausea and sore arms. The regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, has received 288 reports of heart inflammation among people who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, as well as 160 reported instances of a rare clotting complication linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.

&gt;The regulator noted in a report last week that new illnesses or deaths within a few days or weeks of inoculation were ‚Äúoften coincidental, rather than being caused by the vaccine.‚Äù Nine deaths have been linked to Australia‚Äôs inoculation program, nearly all of them among people age 65 or older.

&gt;It is unclear how a few hundred recorded cases of adverse effects have led to 10,000 registrations of interest in the compensation program. For the most part, Australia‚Äôs vaccination program has been a slow and then rapid success: After initial setbacks, an outbreak of the Delta variant pushed the country to move quickly to vaccinate its population.

&gt;The country‚Äôs two largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, recently emerged from lengthy lockdowns, and case numbers have been declining nationwide to fewer than 1,500 per day.

I'm high risk so I'm obviously going to be doing it longer than many people, probably always at medical appointments and during dense travel scenarios.

I hope you are a person that understands unvaccinated people are dangerous to community spread and that the vaccinated don't have full immunity but do have a reduced ability to spread. And maybe have some empathy for those of us who will always have to mask because you want to take yours off sooner. 

* What is community spread like? Looking to the hospitalizations and positivity rates and determining if you being unmasked will burden a system and take beds away from people with non-preventable illnesses. 
* What treatments exist? Right now, we're on the cusp of another medical treatment and antibodies are a primary way to reduce danger, even to the vaccinated. Without more treatments, we need to mask.
* How are the vaccines holding up long-term? In my area, October had 30% of hospitalizations from the vaccinated having more severe cases. With the booster, this has already dropped almost 5 points. 
* Will unvaccinated people be present? You shouldn't associate with them because you become a vector but since they do exist, they should always be masking. It should be mandatory. And as long as it isn't, you should view them as the danger they are. 
* You should always mask if you are ill. Whether it's Covid or not. Ideally you wouldn't go in public but I recognize that will never happen. 
* Watch the animals. We're still learning what's going on there. I'm watching deer season in my state to see if there's any weirdness, though I don't expect it. 
* Follow the science. Things change. You can't predict today what you'll do next month. I was okay with my husband taking off his mask indoors in May. In June, Delta took out my state and he quickly put the mask back on without me even requesting it. In September my husband's brother died of Covid. So also follow the trauma and show understanding about masking around people who lost someone.
