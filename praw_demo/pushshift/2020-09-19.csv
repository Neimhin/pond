[],,Sincost121,,,[],,,,text,t2_cvgdq,False,False,[],"&gt;It‚Äôs like they think slavery and racism was solely an American thing. 

It wasn't, but you're missing the point. For an economically developed country, America clung to slavery for a disgusting amount of time and it still scars us to this day. Look at the amount of people defending confederate statues and flags. And yes, I'm sure you can find terrible things in the past of most countries, but what matters is how you move past it. We haven't. Slavery had long lasting impacts past even when it was outlawed in the forms of share cropping, social prejudice, and ideological state apparatuses that in turn still affect us today. MLK and Fred Hampton were murdered around 50 years ago. That's well within a life time. These are sins we as a society still have not moved past.

That's not to say other nations don't also have issues with institutionalized racism, but we still seem to be the worst at it.

Not only that, but the other instances aren't like slavery that transcend through societies. Cointelpro, the genocide of the native americans, the Chilean Coup, the Iran Coup, MK Ultra, the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, all things done specifically by the US.

&gt;If you actually think America was never great then why did all of our ancestors immigrate here?

You're missing the point. America always was, and has been, a land of great economic and personal promise for the individuals that live here. That doesn't mean that both our government and our society at large haven't done bad things.

Economic and personal promise are completely divorced from the holistic view of 'great', at least, in my eyes. If economic and personal prosperity is your sole qualifier for 'great' than, yeah, American always has been and certainly still is. We have the highest GDP and the high average quality of life that comes with that, and that's not going to change for a while, but, even by your admittance, we've 'lost our way', so, by your view, personal quality of life and 'great'-ness are diverged. 

Hell, it seems that the least we can agree on is that the Trump administration is bad, but America is still a great place to live for the majority of people, and certainly has a higher quality of life than other places, ergo, conflating wether or not people want to immigrate here and our 'great'-ness is inaccurate.

&gt;We‚Äôve certainly lost our way and have been in steady decline for 30 years but to claim that America was never great is just lunacy.

Eh. I mean, I think the issue we're having here is the nebulousness of the term 'great'. Again, from my perspective, we're a country founded on land stolen by way of genocide and built by slave labor, and when that slavery ended, it was immediately followed up by segregation, and when that was ended, it was followed up by institutionalized racism and things like Cointelpro and our tragic foreign policy during the cold war, and following that we get into the Iranian coup and our continued destabilization of the middle east.

From my perspective, I wouldn't in good conscience call that 'great' due to the immorality that's come with our history, despite whatever economic growth or  promise of 'freedom' we offer to anyone who lives or wants to live here.

&gt;All these people just regurgitate everything they hear from each other because they refuse to educate themselves and break from the hive mind. Both on the Left and the Right.

I mean, I'm a socialist. Not a very popular stance here in America, and I spend most of my free time (trying) to read economics, so, you know, you're right that hive minded attitudes are an issue (mostly brought on by either influence from biased media, or as a reaction to biased media, imo), but, hey, I'm trying at least. But what I don't understand what hive mind you're trying to apply me to? 

Saying *'America has never been great'* might be somewhat popular in some circles on reddit, but American political discourse at large is nowhere near accepting of that view.

TL;DR: all I meant was to express frustration at the lack of urgency by the healthcare system. These crises can be abated but are not so there must be a gap.

Maybe it's my manifestation but I feel if I know well in advance of an appointment that I will spend the whole time with my switch flipped off, I'm going to remove myself from the appointment because that isn't healthy and I know the switch will only flip back when I'm ready to flip it.

I'm truly not trying to diminish the valid scenarios where an appointment breaks up as opposed to this tantrum-induced willful malfeasance, and in normal times I understand accomodating these things in a healthy way that just isn't convenient for other patients. 

But this isn't a regular time during a regular time, this is a specific crisis during a general crisis. I cannot stress enough that the alarm bells are ringing and all hands must be on deck. Water water everywhere and not a drop to drink.

That is partially true, however it still does not support your previous claim that said that people will be ‚Äúeffectively 100% protected‚Äù by wearing them. People still get sick, even if they have these masks. The viral load is only tied to severity, but you can still get infected if the virus enters your respiratory system, which can happen if you‚Äôre careless or that sub-5% amount of particles that aren‚Äôt blocked enter you

&gt;People in Colombia would still be wearing masks in the kind of places you'd visit as a tourist: taxi cabs, hotel receptions, airport. I wouldn't travel on public transportation there or go hang out with locals in their houses, yes.

Dude you clearly haven‚Äôt been to Colombia. There is no mask mandate and some people don‚Äôt really care about the virus. If you do go to a tourist exclusive area, there is still no guarantee that the guests themselves will wear masks too.

&gt;The virus takes 3 days at most to die outside the human body. So you need 3 masks at most and rotate them every day.

You‚Äôre correct about the virus only living about 3 days on surfaces, but not about masks. It‚Äôs literally in the cdc guidelines that you‚Äôre not supposed to be reusing n95 masks and other similar masks. If your theory was correct, there wouldn‚Äôt have been such a massive need for ppe 

&gt;The ""healthcare providers have a shortage of masks"" line is old news. The shortages have now been long solved. China is now pumping out insane numbers of PPE every week, plus the demand has fallen as most people have a few masks they use by now.

It‚Äôs old news to an extent. Medical providers still need a constant stream of reusable masks, especially in hard-hit areas. At least in the US, many cities are still struggling to obtain sufficient ppe for their stockpile. It is still a cdc guideline to leave respirators like n95 to medical professionals who need the extra protection.

&gt;Now, if you're scared of COVID for your dear life, I'm not forcing you to go anywhere. But don't start telling people that there's no way they could travel safely. It's perfectly possible with a little bit of preparation.

I know you‚Äôre not forcing me to go anywhere, but you‚Äôre painting the false picture that it is safe to go to Colombia right now. They are still having pretty high case numbers. I agree that it‚Äôs safe to travel with a bit of preparation, but only to certain destinations (basically ones that have contained the virus).",,,1600564216,{},g5wdbac,False,t3_iw14dd,False,True,t1_g5w9eac,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iw14dd/colombia_officially_reopening_borders_for_tourism/g5wdbac/,1600627260,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

And it's not just analyzing where they started, is analyzing everything about them, how they have evolved and how they affect you, and how they make you do or think things that make you feel bad.

Note with Honolulu: Their infection rate is inflated due to the small population. (infect rate: 1:3 vs 300:900) In terms of cases numbers, 1 vs 300 is significantly different especially with a virus that multiplies at an exponential rate. Also, their hospital system is trash.

My parents had met up with all 19 people several times throughout the summer in Pennsylvania and not one of them has gotten sick (to my knowledge). The adults are mostly working from home, except one is a doctor.

Guess I'll be monitoring symptoms and maybe I'll take a covid test at some point. Just sad that this even had to happen. If I get sick my efforts would have been for nothing. I put my life at risk, but I just didn't really have a choice (dad threatened to evict me if I didn't go).

The economy *is* peoples lives. The economy that you're apart of. Without it, you'd be smashing rocks together to keep warm. We're talking about peoples lives when we say economy. And if theres no one working, theres no money circulating to fund those who cant work. 

Closing the economy is a cascade effect. If there's no one to come in and buy products from my store, suddenly I'm out of business along with any of my employees (hypothetically), and on top of that, my suppliers then lose business and need to lay workers off.

How can we expect 22 million people to live below the poverty line? Taxes? The average monthly income in the US is 3400-3500 dollars.

Compared to what?  Maybe you have an argument for live, attenuated virus vaccines simply because less material is needed.  But, in general, no, they aren't expensive, finicky, or time consuming to produce.  

&gt;If this turns out to be the only working vaccine, there won't be enough bioreactor capacity in the world to produce enough inactivated coronavirus to vaccinate everyone in a reasonable time frame

Yes, there is.  More than enough.  We can take bioreactor-based influenza vaccine production as an example.  If the influenza vaccine has 45 ug of HA per dose, at  1x10^9 pfu/mL, a single 1000-2000 L bioreactor with microcarriers can produce 20 million doses per flu season.  Now, the inactivated Sinopharm vaccine dose is only 5 ug.  MW of S1 is about twice that of HA so take that into account.

Yes. Because there's a pandemic. No different from the laws that make you wear seatbelts or drive at controlled speeds or not have sex with minors. Y'know, common sense stuff.

&gt;The xxxxxx of Massachusetts (a xxxxxx) initially said flu vaccines would be mandatory for working at or attending public school this fall, but he quickly walked that back when people went ballistic.

And that's why ~~you all~~ the US have a higher death rate than the WWI.

Have to say, you dropped a great dog-whistle there.

***EDIT:*** u/cedars

&gt;The UK death rate is higher than in the US 

[Except it really is not](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)

&gt;so I‚Äôm not sure why you mentioned the US death rate when you posted an article about protestors in the UK.

Oh, I'm sorry. Should I have checked with your excellency before dropping facts? Forgive me, m' lud

***EDIT:*** u/cedars

&gt; Worldometer? That‚Äôs a legitimate source? Why not Globeometer or Earthometer? I trust credible sources like the [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html?referringSource=articleShare) for information. But, please, keep on using Roundometer for all of your fact-checking needs. 

NYT uses Worldometer. Played yourself. 

&gt;You contradicted your views in your comment ‚Äî universal healthcare not being an authoritarian measure and then being surprised that US citizens won‚Äôt stand for forced sterilization ‚Äî and you included a source with an -ometer suffix. Try again. 

No. You not knowing the definition is not my problem.

&gt;Also, I‚Äôm sure other users would appreciate if you didn‚Äôt tag them in your comments.

The kind of cancer I have isn't detectable through mammogram.  I was lucky to have dense tissue in the affected breast because they couldn't read the image and I had to come in for a follow-up evaluation a month later. The follow-up mammogram came back negative, but the radiologist did an ultrasound on me just to make sure. The ultrasound is what picked up the cancer.

I am grateful to both my PCP and the radiologist because I really do believe both women saved my life.  I also am grateful to my wonderful surgeon, who didn't second-guess me when I said I wanted a mascetomy.  She initially thought I only had one small tumor, so it would not have been that unreasonable for her to question my decision.  But it turned out I had 15 freakin' tumors!  They weren't discovered until they did the autopsy on the breast post-surgery.  It blew my mind to realize I had all that in my breast!  They were apparently real close to the skin, but there was no physical sign they were there.  No lumps or anything. 

I'm always going to request an ultrasound from now on.  I'm guessing it is more expensive than a regular mammogram, but I don't care.  It freaks the hell out of me that I could have 15 tumors in my breast (which wasn't even that big!) and have none of them show up in TWO mammograms. This is apparently typical for invasive lobular caricomona, but *no one talks about this*.  It makes me wonder how many women have died from breast cancer despite going in for routine mammograms and checking themselves.

Just because you can decrease R0 without masks doesn't mean they can't help you decrease R0.

And literally everything researchers have looked into has shown masks not only reduce spread, but reduce chances of a severe case. Look at NYC, everyone wears masks, and 90% of their C19 positive tests are from people asymptomatic or with very mild symptoms with such low viral loads they're likely not infectious and while a PCR would pick their infection up, a rapid may not. So not only are people getting less sick and gaining immunity from masks, but they're also less likely to spread it themselves then. 

Not to mention prior to C19 even existing we already knew that masks help stop spread infectious diseases spread by respiratory droplets. So the fact there was ever debate on it is insane, when we literally are debating something we knew for over a century. I blame public health officials lying and giving fuel to those starting the fire.

The data is clear. Not just in studies, but all research done into countries and states has shown those who have mask mandates or a big increase in adherence to masking show a very quick decrease in R0. Now just because it can help bring the R0 down doesn't mean that other factors can't drive it back up. People not adhering to policies, more people gathering indoors, and weather that is optimal for spread can all bring the R0 back up to a number where an outbreak occurs. This doesn't mean masks aren't working, the outbreak would be faster and worse without them. 

Some people act like because its not 100% effective it doesn't work, but on the contrary, health officials believe masks may even be more effective than the first wave of VACCINES!!! They work, yeah you can still contract C19, but your chances are lower of both infection and severe disease. Two things I would assume most people want to avoid.

The IMHE models have been pretty clear as well. Curves with a mask mandate in place are just plain less steep. You should check out the predictions for the US with a mandate vs without. Either way they predict a big wave, but without masks they predict over a million infections a day at one point. I tend to think their predictions are definitely more worst case scenarios, but the point still stands. They show it makes a difference like all data we have found.

They're especially important for densely populated areas, and the Eastern World has been using them for this reason for ages, prior to the pandemic. Again, the effectiveness at masks for helping prevent spread of diseases spread by respiratory droplets was known before C19 even existed.",,,1600625450,{},g60atni,False,t3_iwbzwi,False,True,t1_g5z4w55,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iwbzwi/spain_hospitals_in_madrid_nearing_the_abyss_18_of/g60atni/,1600697266,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

As long as is necessary? If you thought about how many people are separated for longer than that because of logistics, political reasons, money, immigration, or more. I was away from my wife for over a year because of visa issues some time back. It sucks, and it was nowhere near as big of a deal as this shit is. Life is tough.

Seems like much ado about nothing. 3% of people who contract it die. The mortality rate for the flu is 1%. Why exactly are we still even shutting anything down? What‚Äôs the plan, 2 more years of lockdown?? Open the economy back up. Wear masks, let‚Äôs get back to some sort of normalcy!!

I'll break this down sentence by sentence.

1. 300 million people with 200k deaths. Sounds about right.
2. 0.07% death rate based on total population - a useless statistic because it takes into account people who were not infected. 
3. 3% of people contracting COVID are dying. I don't know what numbers you used to calculate this so I can't comment on it.
4. 1% of people contracting the flu are dying. It's really weird how you calculate an overall death rate for COVID but not the flu, because I know this is not based on total population. Doing a quick calculation based on symptomatic infections and deaths, I get about 0.1%. So we know it's not based on that. Where are you getting 1%? 
5. Why are we shutting things down? We're not, for the most part. We're finding alternatives to our lifestyle temporarily while we get a handle on this virus which we have not. Too many people don't give a fuck about this country and its population. They only care about themselves. And it shows when you compare to virtually everywhere else in the world. 

Also, you're right I am afraid of this virus. I have ESRD which puts my immunity at risk. I still go out because I know social distancing and mask wearing helps. There is plenty of data to back it up from all around the world. The problem is half the country thinks this is either a liberal hoax or that masks are the sign of the devil (obviously no evidence to support any of those claims).

I do not understand the pathetic attempt to mock me for being naturally fearful of a deadly virus.

And it's funny you bring up Canada, because one of the most dense parts of the country (British Columbian lower mainland) was barely hit by the virus comparatively to the other less dense provinces and full mandated lockdown didn't come into effect for nearly as long or nearly as strictly as the rest of the country.

Now it's probably important for me to say that correlation does not mean causation. And we should be careful to not act so swiftly.

[],,DarkwarriorJ,,,[],,,,text,t2_i0cf6,False,False,[],"""I'm not expert in the subject but I can't fathom how people feel safer with more guns around."" Generally speaking; I agree; I don't see how having a gun makes you safer against someone else with a gun. Much of the training there involves an insane amount of active vigilence and being quicker on the draw; but that's an insanely unstable situation. It's not like swords and shields, where seeing someone with the weapon out gives you time to draw yours to defend. 

For me, however, the main thing is that the statistics seem to say having guns around don't make you less safe either, as it turns out. The murder and gun ownership rates are pretty frighteningly uncoordinated; and speaks more to the idea that culture, economics, and societal health are vastly more important than the presence of most guns. 

This said: "" Also, if gun ownership becomes so common that a criminal expects you to carry a gun, that becomes just one more reason for him to rob you. Any gun is worth more than anything you carry in your pocket.""

That doesn't sound true. If you said that it gives him more of a reason to shoot you just to be sure, well yeah; but guns aren't actually worth that much. Common assault rifles are less than $900; pistols a fraction of that, whilst in one's wallet, a credit card is a goldmine and any jewelry easily comparable. This also said, very different contexts; I take it that you're Brazilian, whilst I'm Canadian. The calculus for a criminal in Brazil may be drastically different than what I'd think of.

""There are many banal murders that wouldn't happen if that person didn't have access to a gun. I don't have data but I wouldn't be surprised if those crimes were more common than people actually saving their lives in self defense.""

They almost certainly are, but those murders are usually just as easily carried out by knives, and banning knives is the sort of thing that is somewhere between ludicrous and impossible. Plenty of places have scary knife murder rates where guns are  less prevailent. Granted, guns probably 'reduce the friction' of doing so, so to speak.

""Another factor is that the higher the demand for guns the larger the batches of bullet produced. Tracing bullets is very helpful at identifying potential suspects for a murder. For example in Brazil there was an actress who got killed in the 90s and they got to her murderer because the batch of the bullets used had only a few thousands bullets. 2 years ago there was a congresswoman called Mariele Franco who got killed by militias but they can't use the same method because the batch has a few million of bullets.""

Now this is cool. I never even considered that; thanks for telling me about this. As a forensics trick, it's one of those big-brain things that wouldn't have been my first thought, although I'm not sure how well it works as a gun control argument.

""One last thing is that when people can buy advanced guns legally, the criminals will get better armed. The most common gun used on murders in Brazil is also the best selling gun for the past 20 years. It's a pistol that is so old that any street mugger might have obtained it as a small debt payment. Now the president wants people to have the right to own semi automatic rifles. In Brazil only organized crime has that kind of gun. Now imagined if any criminal have access to this gun the consequences.""

Fair; I think this again boils down to the drastically different situations that Brazil is in versus Canada. In the Canadian context, virtually all gun murders are pistol murders, and we found that 'long guns', such as shotguns and rifles, constitute less than 10% of all such murders despite long guns being unlicensed and more prevalent. In our context, we don't have ongoing gang wars quite like Brazil, and anyone taking a long gun out into the middle of the streets would probably have the police called on them, who would actually respond fairly quickly. I know less of Brazil, but I have heard of the ongoing gang wars contributing to Brazil's terrifying total number of homicides, so I presume Brazil's context is pretty far removed from Canada's.

The argument of guns from the perspective of self defense never sat right with me; but it's just that on an international level, having more legal gun ownership does not appear to make most nations less safe. But the specifics of the Brazilian context I've never looked into; it's clear that not one size fits all and I have much to investigate given free time.

Overconfidence in herd immunity, overconfidence in individual responsibility in a pandemic needing community-centered approaches, overconfidence in evidence-based medicine and neglect to coordinate with the WHO and other countries may be associated with post-materialist values and postmodernism including opposition against modern authority, rationality and science, and also an anti-traditionalist stance towards older generations.

It's a) when you are showing symptoms OR b) in high risk areas.
Usually you wear one when you are showing symptoms but have to be in public. The only other exceptions to this are public transport since those are how everyone gets sick so often so it would be beneficial to wear one then even if you're not showing symptoms. Then like fucking magic you can take it off when you're away. It's not that difficult.

It's such a niche scenario, too. It wouldn't be in your daily life unless you get colds a thousand times a year.
Do you also shrug off condom wearing? Because it's the same thing.
Nobody here is talking about eradicating risk. It's about not being a walking germ vector willingly. These risks will always exist, but if you could cut them down significantly you're saying you wouldn't? Who's the insane one, again?

&gt; Now that the places have been expanded, the department is also prepared to fly covid patients from affected countries in Europe, says operations manager Lars Falk at the ECMO center.

&gt; ‚ÄúIf you need our help with a covid patient or another patient, right now we have no problems receiving as we have overcapacity, I would say. We can receive Swedish patients and at the same time help abroad, especially when we start to see a second wave in the UK, Spain, Italy and France‚Äù, says Lars Falk, operations manager for the ECMO center at Karolinska University Hospital in Solna.

&gt; ECMO care is given to people who are dying in conventional intensive care and who are judged to survive with an ECMO machine. It is an advanced heart-lung machine.

&gt; More than 30 covid patients from different parts of Sweden have been cared for here. Some in here have been receiving care for over a hundred days now. The department is equipped for new cluster infections in Sweden and can also relieve other countries.

&gt; Ekot has been allowed to enter the new modern pandemic hall, which was completed in September. Walls have been folded in and hospital beds have been delivered from the USA.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe have had lots of staff with covid patients and at the wall next to it there have been 40 construction workers and worked around the clock to get a room ready so that we could care for even more patients‚Äù, says operations manager Lars Falk.

&gt; The department has access to jet aircraft and is unique in Europe when it comes to long-haul flights with the seriously ill and normally helps other countries with regular patients. During the most difficult time during the pandemic, the ECMO center has only focused on patients in Sweden. Now they are also ready to pick up covid patients in Europe.

Again back to the Fox News and Facebook echo chamber conspiracy theories. Stop peddling your opinion as fact. It's misinformation and does nothing for anyone. Many countries have suffered from this, and entirely too many have already died. 

I agree that a lockdown isn't a long-term solution. But masks are invaluable in the midst of all of this. If every American pulled their head out of their ass tomorrow and started masking up in public, we might actually gain a little traction and start to get this under control.

People who have done clinical research should be aware that the reason it's *usually* turtle-slow is because you're at the mercy of everything beyond the experiment itself. For example, not enough people signing up, volunteers failing to show up, not enough funds, funding suddenly gets dropped, personal issues, uncoordination in the research team, and a whole bunch of other things. Then you also have to get your next phase approved, and your research experiment is not the only experiment waiting to get approved for the next phase. Yours is a single paper in a giant pile.

The coronavirus is different. This affecting literally everyone in the world and isn't some disease that affects &lt;1% of a population. It gets top priority in funding, manpower, peer review, and approval.

Thousands of labs are doing research on the coronavirus and tons of money is being pooled into making a vaccine. So with unlimited funds, unlimited manpower, unlimited volunteers, you can get stuff done pretty quickly and thoroughly.

The original GDP prediction was in the double didgit percentage...

considering that Sweden is much more service and trade focused than our neighbours it should not suprise you that our drop was large...
Its almost like you just copypaste nice graphs without actually understanding what they are representing...

And comparing Sweden to a small Island with the economic power less than half of Sweden isnt exactly fair.
New zeland isnt compareable to Sweden in any way...


&gt;You might want to heed that advice too. I've given you actual data/facts, which part of it do you disagree with?

Says the one comparing new Zeeland to Sweden xD

Copy pasting graphs is not providing and usable data...
You can't compare Sweden to its neighbours because we have different economic structures, population size and how we actually got hit in the beginning...
Its ""easy"" to controll a pandemic when you live in a Island in the middle of nowhere compared to a nation which economic structure is almost solely based on international trade...

You could be constructive in your critizism, but you aren't...
Which is sad beyond belief...

You could actually critizice WHO, downplaying this pandemic early this year/late last year.
You could critizice sweden for not having propper medical stockpiles (which is a actually issue here).
You could critizice that we (for some dumb reason) decided that state run eldercare have to compete with private elder care (boomer politics).
You could critizice Swedish death reporting, so it would paint the picture that we're sacrificing our citizens (only dumbfucks belive that).

Locking down the entire population for a shorter duration. See Finland or New Zealand as the other option.

So since you can't dispute it, how is it *untrue* that you sacrificed the elderly?

&gt;
&gt;A lockdown could not be applied to Sweden, our ""grundlagar"" prohibits that... Why are you ignoring this? Like, the Swedish goverment would have extended our lockdown/restrictions of they could...

Sweden is free to do whatever it wants. I'm just clarifying the false narrative that you're pushing.

&gt;Ok? Did i state the opposite? 2019 we had reported under mortality, the last time we had such ""low"" mortality was in 1977...

If you had underreported mortality but excess deaths in 2020, then the difference caused by COVID becomes more egregious. What's your point?

Also, let's clarify some facts about Sweden. These are graphs representing a government's response index:

https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/images/country_charts/Sweden.png

https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/images/country_charts/Finland.png

https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/images/country_charts/New%20Zealand.png

The data doesn't support the narrative that the Swedes enjoyed more freedom because they didn't lockdown.

In terms of the economy:

'Sweden's GDP fell 8.6% during the second quarter of the year, according to its statistics body. The fall is sharper than its neighbors ‚Äî Denmark registered a 7.4% fall, and Finland a 3.2% fall. Statistics suggest Norway also fared better than Sweden.'

https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-sweden-gdp-falls-8pc-in-q2-worse-nordic-neighbors-2020-8

'Studies of consumer spending data shows purchases fell by 25 percent in Sweden and 29 percent in Denmark, which instituted a strict lockdown.

Other economic indicators for Sweden are not looking wonderful either.

The IMF predicts Sweden's GDP will fall by 6.8 percent this year and then increase by 5.2 percent the next. By comparison, New Zealand's GDP is expected to fall 7.2 percent this year and then rise by 5.9 percent the next - although this projection was made prior to the move to Level 2 nationally and Level 3 in Auckland last week.

Unemployment in Sweden rose from 6.7 percent to 9 percent for the year ended June. In New Zealand, year-on-year unemployment was flat at 4 percent. An April projection from the IMF estimates Sweden will end the year with 10.1 percent unemployment, while prior to the latest lockdown, New Zealand was expected to reach around 10 percent unemployment at the end of the September quarter.'

As shown, economies are not destroyed by lockdowns and Sweden didn't do better in that regard despite not going into lockdown. Can you tell me how having that much more cases/deaths per capita was worth it?

&gt;They are not objective but solely based om feelings, which is only harmfull for the general discussion...

It‚Äôs impossible to know how things would have unfolded, but the point is that there is still a bit of time.

And even if you believe we are beholden to the decisions of corporations deciding to make a difference with climate change, at some point there will have smart enough people in charge to see how terribly it will impact the business.

To close with the dreaded flu comparison, the CDC estimates that between 46,000 and 95,000 Americans died due to influenza during the 2017-18 flu season. Influenza has an estimated IFR of 0.1%.

[],,casualphilosopher1,,,[],,,,text,t2_1tw5fjdk,False,True,[],"Britain‚Äôs obesity crisis could prevent a vaccine from ending the pandemic, experts have warned.

Scientists are concerned that vaccines being developed to protect against COVID-19 may be less effective in fat people, leaving them more vulnerable to infection, which could, in turn, put others at risk. If they do become infected, obese adults face a 113 per cent higher risk of being taken to hospital, a 74 per cent increased likelihood of being admitted to intensive care and a 48 per cent higher risk of death. The UK has one of the worst obesity rates: two out of three adults are overweight or obese. Millions have piled on the pounds since March, with an average gain of 0.7 kilograms.

The concern among scientists and public health experts is that this weight problem could undermine the effectiveness of a vaccine. The ability of tens of millions of fat Britons to return safely to work, care for their families and resume daily life could be limited if the coronavirus vaccine provides weak immunity.

Vaccines against flu, hepatitis B, tetanus and rabies are less effective in obese adults than in the general population. Experts fear that the COVID-19 vaccines in development will suffer the same limitation. Melinda Beck, professor of nutrition at North Carolina University and an expert in the link between obesity and vaccines, said: ‚ÄúWe had a study where we had 3,400 adults enrolled and everybody received the flu vaccine. You had twice the risk of developing flu despite vaccination if you were an individual with obesity. That finding makes us worry about the COVID-19 vaccine.‚Äù Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London, said: ‚ÄúIt couldn‚Äôt be more serious. In vaccines that are already in routine use, people who are more obese tend to make a less effective response to the vaccine.‚Äù He said he had been ‚Äúshown quite scary data that the more overweight you are, the more you drop your immune response‚Äù.

In July, Boris Johnson set out a plan to reduce obesity levels through measures such as a ban on unhealthy snacks at shop check-outs. Restaurants will have to display the calories in dishes on menus. There will be a consultation on doing the same for alcohol.

The prime minister admitted he was ‚Äúway overweight‚Äù when he was in hospital with the coronavirus in March. He has since lost a stone and become fitter by changing his diet and going on morning runs.

Separately, it is understood that scientific advisers have raised concerns with Downing Street that many Britons think that a vaccine will guarantee immunity from COVID-19. They are worried that those who have received a vaccine may be cavalier about social distancing and other measures. Most experts agree that no vaccine will offer full immunity.

‚ÄúWhen I look at the trials published,‚Äù Altmann said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a case of ‚Äòso far, so good‚Äô, since virtually all seem to do what it says on the tin. That leaves the big question of whether they‚Äôre likely to be protective. If so, will this be ‚Äòsterilising immunity‚Äô - no chance of virus gaining entry at all - or partially protective immunity, just mitigating the consequences of infection so that people don‚Äôt become severely ill with pneumonia?

‚ÄúFrom those that have so far published protection studies in animal models, the second scenario looks a more likely prospect. So, this could see us out of the pandemic, but still leave a reservoir of the virus out there, ready to re-emerge, especially if there are communities with low herd immunity. The vaccines will help enormously, but won‚Äôt offer us a Covid-free world overnight.‚Äù

Ohid Yaqub, who lectures in science policy at the University of Sussex, said: ‚ÄúSome people might take it, and think, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm invincible now.‚Äô It might encourage people not to wear masks or not distance properly, or even go clubbing.‚Äù

Premise:

&gt; Offit: Once we know the characteristics of these vaccines, then we can explain what we know and what we don‚Äôt know. **Let‚Äôs say theoretically that a vaccine‚Äôs 75% active** at preventing moderate to severe disease. It‚Äôs been in 20,000 people, including people over [the age of] 65, people who are African-American or Latino, people who have certain co-morbidities, and it‚Äôs been shown to be safe. 

Argument:

&gt; MarketWatch: **The FDA guidance in June suggested around 50% for the COVID-19 vaccines**. Do you think there needs to be more education to the public that the vaccine may not be a sure shot in protecting against the virus?
&gt; 

This refers to:

&gt; primary efficacy endpoint in a placebo-controlled efficacy clinical trial should be at least 50%

And so:

&gt; Offit: Even if it‚Äôs highly effective, it‚Äôs still not going to be a sure shot. **If you get 75%, that means one out of every four people who get it could still get moderate to severe disease, which can cause them to be hospitalized or die, which is why they‚Äôre still going to need to wear a mask.** It will probably be a greater percentage, more than 25%, who could still get either mild infections or asymptomatic infections or they could still shed and be contagious. 

**It's a theoretical discussion of one bad case**. So far we know nothing of the actual efficacy of even one of the vaccines.

We might not get to such a bleak situation.

And yes, your system was more broad, though it started as just unemployed;   
You expanded it to cover anyone still working, but making under $1000 CA a month.

I'm not denying that Canada's coverage was more broad, and generous.

I'm just saying, everyone that says we got one $1200 US and that's it, is inaccurate.   
So is saying we had to jump through many hoops to get the $2400 per month unemployment.

And that's only because I was self employed, and normally wouldn't qualify for any unemployment, due to not paying state unemployment taxes.

There was no coordinated national response.  Other countries like Germany also have Federal governments, with most powers devolved to states, but they still managed a coordinated response.

In the US, the crucial early testing failed specifically because of failures at CDC and FDA.  No one else was legally allowed to test.  Not only did the Federal response fail, it prevented anyone else from doing it.  Not until the Seattle Flu Study broke the law and began testing patients with their own test did we realize Covid was actively spreading in the community.

And that's really, really damning. China was able to develop testing infrastructure faster without any advance notice.  In the US, even with a month of warning, we failed to develop testing.  This crucial early failure has stymied the US response ever since.  In this month, the virus became widespread within the US, and we had zero contact tracing.

The US never developed a national contact tracing effort. Germany did.  This has led to a patchwork of efforts in the US, with some states doing it effectively, and most doing it terribly.

We had 200,000 Census workers we could have re-deployed as contact tracers.  The job requirements are largely the same.  But we did nothing.

The US went through all of January, watching what was happening in China, and did nothing to prepare PPE supplies.  Not until the virus was extremely widespread did Federal efforts to secure PPE ramp up.

People are saying that USA should have gone into lockdown months ago because what you are doing right now is not working. People are also saying that what Sweden is doing is working in Sweden, aside from the fact that the disease got into care homes, where we only put people that are so weak or mentally gone that they can't take care of themselves.

[the mayo clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-safe-travel-advice/art-20486965) Says pretty much the same thing. Basically, planes have very high grade air filtration. Plus they are constantly taking in fresh air as they fly.

Taking calculated risks is fine, in order of priorities.

If your state is opened to that level, that's great, congratulation, your state is doing great!

But ""how long is unreasonable to be away from a significant other"" has literally nothing to do with the decision. In a theoretical situation where the virus was far more dangerous than it is, and less contained than it is, the above poster would just have to wait, even if its years.

Fortunately, it isn't, so it's okay! But that's not the point I was trying to make. My point is simply that how much someone misses their hubby has very little to do with if they can see them or not.

You kinda missed the whole point of the post you are referring to. He was talking about the current state, how many are infected right now.

Those deaths are surely tragic, but they say nothing about the current situation of the hospitals - which is what was actually being discussed.

&gt; btw healthcare staff are discouraged to weark masks.

One single health care worker was fired, and there were also other reasons cited such as ""patients could not understand what she was saying"" and she had problems with attitude. That is in no way representable for the country as a whole.

&gt; They report data only once a week and they censor the numbers

FHM provide new numbers 4 days a week, including deaths and reported cases. These are never ""censored"". In this death reports, everybody who died and was diagnosed with covid-19 in past 30 days are included. This is the source that is pretty much always used for Sweden's official numbers.

Socialstyrelsen provides a separate death report, that goes by death certificate instead (resulting in a somewhat lower total). These numbers get updated less often, and ""censor"" how many died on a specific day when 3 or less died that day, to preserve patient confidentiality. Of course, these deaths are still counted in the total.

&gt; they delete public emails.

Yes, a single person deleted mails on his work mail. It may or not have been against the rules, but it seems to be more a case of negligence/not knowing the rules rather than actively trying to cover something up.

&gt; After refusing to test asymptomatics or children

Children are being tested in some regions, but not all have capacity enough. There seems to have been some normal colds spreading through the population recently, resulting in record high pressure for testing. Last week, I think there were around 140k tests done with a &lt;2% positivity rate.

FYI, I, together with 10 000 other asymptomatics, was just tested as a part of a large study.

&gt; they are now at an all time high but still vastly inferior to other countries,

Referring to testing? Sweden are currently testing about the same per capita as its neighbours (except Denmark, who are testing like crazy)

&gt; they don't trust citizens to wear masks,

Masks are not discouraged, but at the same time FHM sees no need to start recommending them as long as the spread is going down. 

&gt; but they think they can use DIY swab tests with no instructions. 

Based on one random Twitter post. Just as anecdotal as your story, but wjen I did a DIY swab test I received very clear instructions.

&gt; They have nothing under control.

Things seems quite good right now. Hopefully it stays that way.

&gt; Every thing that should have been done about testing, quarantine, asymptomatics, long term effects study, children, face masks... they did it months after all Europe or simply denied it.

Testing was ramped up way too late, mostly because it wasn't clear whose responsibility it was - the government's or the regions'.

Face masks have not been recommended, like in most of the Nordics (although recently it has changed a bit in the other countries, especially Denmark). This is mostly due to limited evidence of its effectiveness and fear that it might be seen as an alternative to social distancing.

Other than that, people are advised to work from home whenever possible and stay at home when sick. They are granted generous sick leave so they can stay at home when they are sick, or when they have sick children to care for. High schools and universities closed down. Public gatherings limited to 50 people. People advised to avoid public transport if possible. Keep distance and meet up outside instead of indoors. Etc.

Thing is, most people adhered to the recommendations so there was no need to actually enforce things by law.

Although most of those recommendations came a few weeks late. I think many deaths could have been prevented if they came in March instead of April.

&gt; They said Covid would never reach Sweden,

Tbf, not many believed it would even spread out of China in the beginning

&gt; then that the peak was past in March (!)

I do not remember anybody saying that, but even so the actual peak was in April.

&gt; then that Sweden would reach herd immunity in April, no May, no June, no not before vaccine. 

Based on flawed models that thought the virus would behave more like a flu in how it was spread, spreading homogenously through the population. Instead, it rather spreads in clusters, which proved these models quite irrelevant.

&gt; If you really want to know what happen in Sweden, focus on the most downvoted articles. The swedes troll horde is very active in here.

If you really want to know what happens in Sweden, Reddit is a bad place to do so. People either try to make it seem like Sweden did everything perfect or fucked it all up, so they can use it as a tool to further their own agenda (usually either pro or anti lockdown). Nobody seems to care about what actually happened here - all nuance is lost.

1) they kept it quiet for months. The virus was known in december and China went into lock down in January. For a novel virus that has symptoms that are similar to the common flu and takes 2 weeks to show symptoms, with many cases being asymptomatic, I don't see how much earlier China could have known and notified the world on the virus. Let's not forget that since we have the benefit of hindsight now

2) agreed, the handling of the late doctor was not done correctly. However, the doctor did go through social media and announced SARS is back. Such announcements create hysteria, such as panic buying at supermarkets. We can remember almost every country went through toilet paper shortage at the start of the pandemic. And claiming it as SARS would have caused serious panic, since that virus was more deadly. Indeed I stress again, China could have handled it better but there is another side to it.

3) leaked memo. I Dont know about that, need a source

4) taiwan. As a half Taiwanese, (and my mom √† Taiwanese), we both agreed when we saw the n√©ws was that let's not jump to conclusions. This is likely political. And if taiwan knew about it, what about the US which definitely has the best intelligence in the world. That knowledge sure didn't help anyway. 

5) China didn't claim it wasnt p2p transmissible. The actual message then was that there are no evidence it is transmissible. A very big difference, because in science, if you don't have evidence yet, you can't say anything definitive. For a new virus, we don't know anything.

6)travel. At that stage of the pandemic, cases were not wide spread yet. It was still possible to contain with proper screening, and contact tracing. Again, this was a unprecedented situation, and even now we see the economical effects, I'm sure no politician in the world back in February would call for travel ban",,,1600571292,{},g5x0bpu,False,t3_iw2csc,False,False,t1_g5w1xza,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iw2csc/hundreds_of_thousands_have_been_given_chinese/g5x0bpu/,1600639881,15,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

[],,mixAlottaFagina,,,[],,,,text,t2_76x8muz7,False,False,[],"The real lesson of Japan and Sweden is that they are socially isolated societies where people don't socialize across networks as much.

There's also a coincidence, I think, where BOTH Japan and Sweden limit testing to avoid creating drama and panic. This seems confusing, as if the desire to limit testing explains the ""good outcome"" but then, indisuptably the virus isn't in some exponential outbreak in these places.

The coincidence can be explained by the sociology involved. Japan has something called ""wa"" and Sweden it's ""jantlaw"". This is considered a system of social harmony, but the reality is that it's a system of blame, shame and punishment. As a result of the oppressiveness of culture, people tend to be socially distant (original meaning of the word), to avoid occasions where they can be blamed.

This avoiding of contact to avoid blame also causes governments and leaders in these countries to downplay or minimize public crises, and preserve privacy and personal freedom.

So, it's a coincidence.

But, with natural social distancing making both countries well suited to fight the virus, and also the tendency to downplay and limit testing, means both countries appear to have some remarkable ""X-factor"" and are doing much better than they are. In particular there is an misleading signal about the effect of lockdowns, since neither country has done as well as you think, and they are already doing, for cultural reasons, what lockdowns would hope to achieve.

I predict Sweden - whose cumulative distancing effect might be the highest in Europe - will still have a resurgence in winter. Sweden should naturally be doing the best in Europe, because of how culturally people naturally distance, but because of having no precautions for a while and ignoring the crisis, a lot of elderly died for no reason in spite of how well the society has done. Still, this winter resurgence will probably be controlled in the end.

Japan, on the other hand, I predict will have a horrific winter and become a case study of national arrogance and scientific malfeasance. They are limiting testing for the purpose of face, as policy. The virus does spread slowly here, but it spreads. Only holidays, where people avoid going to work, have dampened spread. The spread rate is so slow that the effect of holidays is very strong.

But, without holidays, the spread will continue. It has never stopped in Japan during normal day-to-day life.

If infectivity and severity is worse in winter, and without any holidays for a few months, it might finally get very bad in Japan - which is economically and psychologically exhausted.",,,1600570953,{},g5wza9d,False,t3_ivswzt,False,True,t3_ivswzt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ivswzt/daily_discussion_post_september_19_questions/g5wza9d/,1600639322,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Schools provide a ton of social services to local communities that are necessary for their ability to thrive;

- Free and reduced lunch programs; for some kids their free lunch at school is the only meal they get a day because they live in poverty.

- Daycare services, both in the literal sense and in the abstract sense; I would consider daycare pretty damn essential if both parents need to work long hours in order to provide food/shelter/clothes for their kids.

- Healthcare service; school nurses, sexual education, etc.

- Counseling service; many school have a guidance/mental health counselor.

Actually, the people in New Zealand have enjoyed more freedom of movement post-lockdown than those in Sweden for 3.5 out of the last 4.5 months. The people in Finland have also enjoyed similar freedom of movement. Refer to these charts:

I've already given you the data for it that was gathered by Oxford. You might want to peruse it. Or I'll just quote another source:

'The Oxford Policy Stringency Index was developed to rate how strict controls on social and economic life are in different countries battling Covid-19. While New Zealand's Level 4 lockdown was rated 96.3 out of 100 and its Level 3 was 83.33, Levels 2 and 1 are much more relaxed than what other countries are experiencing.

From May 14, when New Zealand moved down to Level 2, we have enjoyed more freedoms than the Swedes. Even now, two-thirds of our population operates in a less strict environment than Sweden. In fact, since February 28, when New Zealand reported its first case of Covid-19, we have spent more time with laxer measures than Sweden than the inverse.'

&gt;No, our goverment could not put the population in a lockdown, that was/is never an option...

Based on which official government body again?

&gt;Again, you didnt read. We had under mortality the previous years... https://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/sverige-i-siffror/manniskorna-i-sverige/doda-i-sverige/ You're basically ignorning what i wrote...

Are you being intentionally disingenuous? If you have a gradually declining total death rate for each year (something that's actually applicable to most first world countries, not just Sweden), then seeing such a big spike in excess deaths in 2020 is indicative of COVID actually affecting your country **worse**.  There is a global correlation between the spike in excess deaths and how poorly a country has handled the outbreak. Why do you think countries like Finland, Norway or Denmark didn't see nearly as many excess deaths per capita?

Just look at the excess death spike for each country. Sweden's is far worse than its neighbours.

https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps

How exactly? None of the data support your claims.

&gt;And comparing Sweden to a small Island with the economic power less than half of Sweden isnt exactly fair. New zeland isnt compareable to Sweden in any way...

Right, and that's why I've compared with Sweden's immediate neighbours too?

&gt;and how we actually got hit in the beginning

How you got hit in the beginning has to do with your response. It's almost like having such a bad outbreak damages your economy just as much as a temporary lockdown does. In which case, you're better off doing the latter to preserve more lives.

I look at the saying ""just deal with it"" as a negative saying like ""suck it up"". Coping and ""just deal with it"" are different in my eyes. It isnt about being unempathetic. We all should learn healthy coping mechanisms and there is nothing wrong with that. Why do we go to therapy? To learn how to cope with issues we are facing or have faced. Why do they offer grief support after losing a loved one in the hospital, or after a still birth or a miscarriage to help you cope with the death and have someone to talk to.

I am not dismissing the concern, but you all are dismissing the issue at hand- a public health crisis. I am very well aware of how truama can impact a person.  I have dealt with truama, I have loved ones who have dealt with severe truama. These are different times, people are not intentionally doing this to emotionally upset people. Its to keep the public safe and patients safe. People are being denied visitors at the hospital for other issues. We are dealing with a public health crisis, hospitals are trying to limit exposures to patients. Because patients are ill from other things, having surgery, undergoing chemo or radiation, whatever the case maybe and adding on a illness with what they are already dealing with can complicate things, not to mention potentially getting other new mothers and babies sick.I just had major surgery back in june and spent 3 weeks in the hospital by myself without a visitor, and honestly the thought of a visitor coming and potentially infecting me on top with the stress my body was under would have been bad, or the thought of someone visiting me and potentially infecting another person there recovering was stressful. 

People are also dying alone right now because they cant have visitors to be on their side. Families also struggling because they cant say good bye.


Everyone is facing some adversity from this pandemic. You have kids who have lost their parents who no longer have anyone. You have people losing their homes, have no food, cant access health care because elective surgeries and tests are being halted. No matter what someone is going to be hurt, but to say oh this is making things intentionally making it worse for grieving mothers  isnt the case, but allowing visitors to bring in additional disease to an already a vulnerable population does make things worse. This is how I look at it that kid undergoing life saving surgery who can die if they can get sick can make even more grieving parents, or a young mom who died leaving their kids behind because someone brought covid in now her kids wont have someone to raise them because I needed my support system because I just had life saving surgery. See how selfish that sounds. I get it, but at the same time no one is looking at anyone else no one is looking at the other mother down the hall, no one is thinking about the babies in the nursery.

Yet the virus seems very reluctant to submit to our behaviorial control and is still infecting hundreds of thousands of people every day. It's like it's a mindless thing with only one purpose and is very good at it.

&gt;If the vaccine has issues of serious illness, people won‚Äôt take it

Yeah. They're called anti-vaxxers. 

They take the fact that a vaccine like the MMR Vaccine can temporarily increase the risk of face and neck swelling, low platelet count and febrile seizures in recipients and declare the vaccine unsafe. 

But they ignore the fact those reactions occur in less than 40 out of every 100,000 recipients while the diseases they prevent carry exponentially greater risks of permanent hearing loss, brain damage, paralysis, infertility and death.

They're callous zealots with whom there is no reasoning with.

Most people though will take the recommendation of their doctor. Who if competent,  will properly analyze the information from the pharma company about the potential risks in the context of their patient's medical history and recommend whether they should have it or if the risks are too great for them.

&gt;The number of adversely impacted might seem small, but the numbers it‚Äôs been tested on is also very small compared to the number of people who will take it.

Which is why I calculated out the percentage of participants that have reported adverse reactions and put it into context with the risk of a broadly used medical procedure used on healthy people.

Of course, the comparison is only contextual as the vaccine trial is not complete and we don't know if the 2 adverse reactions are related to the vaccine, nor do we know if other adverse reactions might occur as the trials progress, along with numerous other unanswered questions that need to be answered before a sound judgement of the vaccine can even be attempted.",,,1600629209,{},g60lvpj,False,t3_iw7yxf,False,True,t1_g6032dg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iw7yxf/astrazeneca_under_fire_for_vaccine_safety/g60lvpj/,1600703608,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,1600629447.0,

You provided the link to this story. Nowhere does it suggest that any of these teachers were infected by students. One of them it said was teaching remotely, another it said students hadn't yet started attending, and the third there was no details given. So yeah, they were teachers but apparently not infected by students. Presumably they were more a threat to the staff at their local grocery store, but we don't give a shit about those people.

Of course people are quitting their jobs everywhere and in every sector. When unemployment pays more than your regular job you are incentivized to not work. When you can not show up without consequence (hello usps staff everywhere), you are incentivized to stay home. When you can half-ass it remotely (teachers) you are never more secure in your job.

My point isn't complicated. It's that low-skilled grocery clerks are, by and large, still working and have been since the beginning. Teachers aren't and haven't, because God forbid they come across an asymptomatic carrier.

Now, you could argue that social distancing and the like is too much to do forever. But a simple mask when showing symptoms or when in high risk places? Come on.
Asian countries do it just fine because they actually give a fuck about other people. Why can't we?


Masks have been proven to work. It's not security theatre. Everything else is overkill once we have a working vaccine, but masks specifically should stay for all the other horrible illnesses we have out there. It's like covering your sneeze. If you feel sick and can't stay home, do yourself and others a small favor.

We would all get sick much less if we followed this simple rule. It's mutually beneficial.
Many diseases can spread without symptoms, but we're primarily talking about colds and flus which are mostly symptomatic. It wouldn't eradicate them, but it would greatly stop the spread. Isn't that a good enough reason to? It's not an end all, but it's not asking too much since we're simply talking about ""high risk"" areas here. Grocery stores, airports, hospitals, and public transport. It would benefit you too. How many times have you gotten sick after being in an airport? I have several times now. Mask wearing would nip this in the bud for all of us.
I genuinely can't think of a reason not to wear a mask in these places. I wore one back in March when I was travelling with my family, and I got significantly less sick than my mother did when the person in front of us coughed.

If we do this *and* begin to address our shitty food supply and obesity, man, can you imagine? This would be fantastic.

The virus is infecting people because it's a virus that is very good at it's sole purpose of spreading itself. 

The time where behavioral controls alone could have eradicated passed as soon as it spread beyond it's origin. It's too communicable and  prevalent in the population ar this point to eradicate with behavioral controls alone.

Isolation, social distancing, wearing masks, washing and sanitizing hands frequently, etc can only be expected to slow the spread. They have no realistic hope of eliminating it.

Theoretically, extremely strict behavioral controls could possibly eliminate the virus in time. But with it today being so prevalent among the world's population, and human nature being irrepressible, it'd require revoking all basic human rights worldwide and strictly quarantining every human being on the planet under penalty if death until it's eliminated to have any chance. And if a drop of bat spit could reintroduce it to humanity, even that extreme of measures would fail.

If everyone was like me, living on a self-suststinable farm in rural Oklahoma, it might be a little different.

I'm assuming the 11,000 people have been exposed over the course of the last 30 days.  Maybe it's less than 30 days, maybe more than 30 days, but I don't know.

Anyway, over the last 30 days approximately 700,000 people have cleared TSA daily.  You can find these numbers on the TSA's own website.

[https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput?referringSource=articleShare](https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput?referringSource=articleShare)

So, assume 700,000 people on flights over the last 30 days.  700,000 \* 30 = 21MM.  Assume that it's only 5.5MM distinct people, however (each person who flew at some time over 30 days cleared TSA on 4 distinct separate days).

(that last assumption is probably high, but it is meant to be high to be conservative for my later calculation).

Thus, that means a person's odds of being exposed to CoronaVirus in the last 30 days - via an airplane flight - is 0.21%.  That is 11,000 divided by 5.5MM.

HOWEVER: also consider this: over the last 30 days, we have approximately 40,000 people newly confirmed with CoronaVirus  cases in America per day.  30 \* 40,000 = 1.2MM.  Even if we assume that all 11,000 ""people who have been exposed"" did contract CV and are part of the 1.2MM, that leaves 1.189MM other people.  1.189MM people out of a population of a population of 329.989MM (330MM - 11,000).  That percentage is 0.36%.

E.g: flying does NOT seem to produce any sort of INCREMENTAL risk of CoronaVirus exposure and infection vs. everything else that is going on in America.  0.21% &lt; 0.36%.

(of note: if my last assumption of each person clearing TSA 4 separate times in 30 days is high, that means the 0.21% number becomes even lower).",,,1600635002,{},g60ztte,False,t3_iwd6fr,False,True,t3_iwd6fr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iwd6fr/nearly_11000_people_have_been_exposed_to_the/g60ztte/,1600712101,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,1600635376.0,

Tourism and Travel account for 2.8% of US GDP, it accounts for 9.8% of NZ GDP and over 20% of export income.  

&gt;We also locked down which caused a 30% reduction in small businesses including 50-60% of restaurants and coffee shops.

The US never had a national lockdown and the lockdowns you did have were never close to as severe as the NZ lockdown.  We did not allow anything but supermarkets and pharmacies to operate. You could not get takeaway food from a restaurant, butchers and fruit and veg shops had to close too.  

&gt;Except it hasn't helped recovery. Even in countries that ""did well"" they're now seeing spikes and resurgence because it only takes a few clusters to begin the spread again. 

It has helped because we had 3 months between the lockdowns when there was no restrictions at all and the economy boomed due to all the pent of demand.  

The second lockdown was much shorter and are very close to elimination again. All social distancing guidelines and capacity limits will be dropped tomorrow in all of NZ except for Auckland.

It's funny when people go on about that ""they gave them morphine instead of oxygen"". Morphine and oxygen are both tools for the same issue. It's for psychological mitigation. They are both used when the patient suffers panic attacks because they feel that they cannot breathe. That is NOT because of lack of oxygen going into the system. There's plenty of oxygen in the air. The problem is the damage on their lungs and in these fragile patients that damage is in many many cases irreversibel.

A close friend of mine has been working closely with covid patients all spring and summer and she told me this story: A man was gasping for his breath. They gave him an oxygen mask but it wasn't hooked to an oxygen tank. It calmed him down and that slowed his breathing down. THAT's what the effect oxygen has in these patients and in that late stage. It's the same with morphine.

People got a very simplistic idea of how the respiratory organs works. It's not all about ""oh the patient can't breathe let's just give him some oxygen and it will be all fine"" when someone's lungs doesn't work. It's not that simple.

According to Redfield, the vaccine won't come out to the general public until halfway through 2021, and according to Fauci, we'll have to maintain pandemic restrictions and precautions for at least one year afterwards.

Too bad a lot of people seem to be having a hard time accepting this; not just on those nutjob conspiracy ""lockdown skeptic"" echo chambers, but on more mainstream subs like this one as well! In spite of consistent recent messaging from trusted health experts too, no less. I feel like we should be trying harder to make this known to as many people as we can find (both online and in real life), but I'm afraid there *is* a growing body of resistance, clambering for a return to pre-pandemic normal as soon as possible in defiance of current public health guidelines and expectations.

Which is why we need our leaders, who (hopefully) locked us down and made us wear masks for several months now, to avoid joining that resistance and declaring everything open the day after the vaccine is out, and to maintain restrictions for as long as the public health situation requires it. Through the holidays? Certainly. Through March 2021? Absolutely. Through the majority of 2021, or even all of 2021? Would count on it. Otherwise, no one would follow. Ideally, all those plexiglass barriers at your workplace and floor-spots in your supermarket should stay as they are, everyone should have to wear masks for as long as they can (even if that means every flu season), all schools should be online for at least this school year (or closing if they have already made the blunder of choosing to open), and (I know, this must be hard for a *lot* of you) all those events that said ""Sorry we're cancelled this year due to the pandemic, see y'all in 2021"" should be cancelled again... because although our world should be *safer*, chances are it's not going to be safe enough to allow such events to begin taking place again. 

If not, we're going to see a *lot* of disobedience and strife: crowds forming on every corner, people flouting gathering limits for the holidays, the police departments of many cities pretending the pandemic is over and refusing to enforce any of the measures, and so on.

Depending on what day your state considered end of the week for unemployment purposes, thats a minimum of 17 weeks.    

So, assuming unemployment (which I think was a factor in Canada's relief payments as well?)    

An american could have recieved at least $11,400 US, in addition to standard unemployment.    
That would be a bit over $15,000 Canadian.    

They also expanded unemployment to cover a lot of people who would not normally be covered, mainly self employed, and gig economy workers (uber, lyft, taxi drivers, etc).     


It's not perfect, but it's a lot more than $1200 per person.     

They are currently working on a second round of stimulus, but I don't think both sides have come to agreement on how much it will be.    
It will likely have another up front payment of $1000 to 1200;  and then there are big differences I what they want to do for unemployment bonuses, one side wants $300 a week extra, the other wants to extend the $600 per week originally given out.",,,1600557691,{},g5vrywe,False,t3_ivrjpd,False,True,t1_g5tyba8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ivrjpd/us_cases_of_depression_have_tripled_during_the/g5vrywe/,1600615751,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

The issue is how, at my job, wearing masks is mandatory and they are provided for free, yet every time I go to the printer office, there is at least one person not wearing one. Or how at my partner's job, even though it is mandatory to wear masks, the boss is constantly taking theirs off, complaining that they're uncomfortable, not actually asking anyone who comes in to wear one, etc. Or how, at my job, even though they have closed cafeterias and eating areas and encouraged people to work flexible schedules, many people will still make the effort to eat with others and not socially distance.

What I never see from people saying all the more extreme measures were not needed is an honest accounting of the alternative: Exponential growth i.e. doubling cases and deaths with no limit.

As long as we have no cure we have to keep R &lt; 1 - there is no alternative - doubling after doubling will overwhelm any health system eventually.

Regardless, offense taken at your ignorant spewing. 

Providers do more than prescribe - you are aware of this, surely? You do know that's not their only function? Even when providers determine that psychotropic medication could be beneficial for a particular patient, pills aren't ""sold"" as some sort of ""convenient solution"". Never have I heard anyone at my hospital or even in the field claiming psychotropic medication is a quick fix cure-all. Quite the opposite.

People like you are the reason stigma surrounding mental illness and treatment persists. Exercise and diet changes can indeed be helpful, and meditation has long been a part of mindfulness (which, you know - of course, you clearly know so much about the field - is often taught to patients along with things like CBT and DBT), but these things will not vanquish persistent mental illnesses. 

Have you ever encountered someone with schizophrenia or psychosis hearing voices, seeing things? Who is actively homicidal or suicidal because *the voices told me*? Have you ever met someone experiencing severe mania, who hasn't gotten more than a few hours sleep the last few nights, is agitated and delusional and being dangerously impulsive? Have you ever had a panic attack? Do you know what it feels like to want to kill yourself, make a plan, and gather the means?

I'm going to guess not. ""Go for a run!""/ ""Cut back your coffee!""/""Meditate on it!"" - these suggestions, while helpful for some and especially for more acute patients, don't solve everything. That's why psychotropic medication and psychotherapy exist. By claiming those things are *all* people need to ""get better"", you're invalidating people struggling with mental illnesses who might need more support than that. You're stigmatizing treatment options that have proven beneficial to so many people - including myself.

&gt;Angry Italian mayors scold people ignoring lockdown rules 
&gt;March 24, 2020 | 1:43 PM EDT
&gt;Local officials across Italy have posted videos on social media, demanding that residents stay at home and obey the lockdown rules.

Then there were the people who fled Milan spreading the disease to the south. From the above NY Times article:

A historical and psychological perspective in the academic world has demonstrated that this sort of thing is unfortunately common in many previous pandemics.

A rise in irrational behaviour as shown in the third point seems to be an unfortunate part of human nature.

Excerpts:

&gt;They  state that while the epidemic lasts the status quo and incumbent  governments tend to consolidate, but warn that a sharp increase in social instability in the aftermath of the epidemic should be expected.  
""Overall,  the historical evidence shows that the epidemics display a potential   disarranging effect on civil society along three dimensions,"" the   authors write.

* First, the policy measures tend to conflict with the interest of people, generating a dangerous friction between society and institutions.
* Second, to the extent that an epidemic impacts differently on society in terms of mortality and economic welfare, it may exacerbate inequality.
* Third, the psychological shock can induce irrational narratives on the causes and the spread of the disease, which may result in social or racial discrimination and even xenophobia.

The USA, even more so than most countries, seems 3 for 3 on those checkpoints. It's almost like everything that could have been done to  bring about all 3 things has been done, to the max.

If the pattern holds and we see a 'sharp increase in social instability'  after the pandemic then we might soon wish we were back in the good old  peaceful days of the 2020 pandemic.

‚ÄúInactivated Virus Vaccines:

This is also a technique that‚Äôs been used in medical practice for many years, and it‚Äôs another inactivation step beyond the attenuated viruses. Heat or chemical agents are used to damage the virus to the point that it can no longer infect cells at all, but the plan is for there to be enough of the viral material left unaltered to still raise an immune response. Not the most high-tech approach, but it can definitely work. Many times, though, vaccines of this don‚Äôt provide enough of a response in a single shot, so you will very likely looking at a booster vaccine schedule.

Finland has registered 1/10th the COVID cases as Sweden. NZ is even lower. Let's not be disingenuous and act like they would somehow have nearly as many deaths as Sweden.

&gt;Looking at the total excess death rate, in which all agree that COVID deaths dominate, Sweden has the same death rate that it had in 2015, while Germany has the same one it had two years ago.

https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps

Nope, Sweden actually had excess deaths from March to June. New Zealand actually saw the opposite - they had fewer total deaths during the period of their lock down. Finland also saw fewer excess deaths than Sweden during the same period.

This data is so easily available. Can people stop spreading misinformation?

&gt;It is very difficult to get real comparisons between countries on your other points. New Zealand's unemployment hasn't changed because they dump all of those furloughed into a unique category called 'underutilization'.

Then look at Q2 GDP losses. Finland went into lock down and saw a smaller drop. New Zealand's was slightly higher than Sweden's. Yet, none of those numbers support the narrative that a lock down destroys the economy.

Also, if those recently furloughed were looking for a job, they would absolutely still be considered unemployed under NZ's criteria. I'm not sure why that misinformation is being spread, their criteria is accessible here:

https://www.stats.govt.nz/indicators/unemployment-rate

https://www.stats.govt.nz/indicators/underutilisation-rate

That being said, what statistic shows that NZ's economy was destroyed by the lock down?

&gt;  
&gt;That is exactly what we've seen the past months where Sweden is trending correct while Denmark exceeded our all time high daily infections.

You don't get what's happening at all. Current projections are that just 12% of the Swedish population has caught COVID 19. That's 2.8% for Denmark. Both of those are NOWHERE near a herd immunity. At this rate, several years of the pandemic would have to have passed, for Sweden to become immune.

Currently infected are 0.12 vs 0.13%, so negligible difference. Denmark is currently doing just as well as Sweden, but managed to slow the initial spread enough to avoid so many deaths. That's the difference.

It's there if you want to see my Eureka moment. I think my lack of understanding is due to my medical care. We can go to urgent cares now, but I've only been once, and they told me there was nothing they could do because my health conditions were chronic and I needed to see my primary. I did not realize they'd give you an inhaler at an urgent care when you already have one prescribed by your normal doctor.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just trying to understand how your life was at risk due to Covid and you putting off appointments, which is what the article is about and your first post implies. I am just not seeing how you having an allergic reaction and needing medical intervention equates to you being at risk by putting off a medical appointment which is exactly what this whole post is about, including your first post.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I almost died for avoiding medical care.   I thought I was having an asthma attack and usually I would go to the doctor to get a treatment or something.  But I didn't because of Covid. 

I am trying to understand how this would be Covids fault. I get you didn't refill your inhaler or make an appointment for a new inhaler because of Covid. But lets say you had. We know now the inhaler would have done nothing. Had you made an appointment with your primary care, it is highly unlikely you would have gotten a same day appointment, unless you had a slow as hell allergic reaction, like days or weeks long that would have done you no good.

Are you saying had there been no Covid you would have gone to an urgent care to try to get your refill filled right then and there? And the medical staff would hopefully recognized your condition for what it was?  Well with a no covid scenario, you would have had your inhaler already and tried it to find it not working, and would have to go to an ER or urgent care anyway.

I am truly just trying to understand how you feel this was due to Covid. I can see the last scenario possibly working, but ultimately that would go back to you not refilling your inhaler with your Primary Care doctor originally. Was that due to Covid? Can you not just call in to your primary care for a refill on medications that are expected to be life long? Fat chance you'd get it any time remotely quickly though if it was mailed. My meds take 3 weeks to get here now, but I mean it's only an increase from 10 days, so not massively large slow down in the post office.

Sorry, I am just confused but I think I am getting a better picture of how it is Covid related.

I've forgotten all the things an urgent care can do, I've always had to go to my primary care doctor for everything, and that's weeks and months of waiting for shit to happen.

&gt;You completely ignore my point about the Harvesting Effect. Sweden had a dearth of death going back 18 months, of about the same size as their number of excess deaths in those five weeks.

That's literally not what the 'harvesting effect' is. Why don't you try again and get the order right this time?

Then again, despite seeing **18 months** of a 'dearth of death', I'm sure it's just some magical coincidence that their excess death spike perfectly aligned with the duration of the outbreak, right?

&gt;And they weren't, because they instead were registered as underutilized. Underutilized are not looking for a job, because government benefits mean they don't need the money.

Sure, so let's look at the change in the underutilisation rate in Q2 then. How does a +1.6% change represent a disaster? Did Sweden not see a similar increase?

&gt;Mandatory lockdowns of the healthy, mandates of where to be and what to wear, are all strategies that never existed in the West before. Politicians panicked and felt they needed to do 'something'. So, copy China.

&gt;	In the summer of 2015, the song was adopted as the theme song for Donald Trump‚Äôs 2016 presidential campaign. The song is played after all his campaign appearances where it is known unofficially as the Trump fight song. Newsweek reports Dee Snider of Twisted Sister gave Trump permission to use the song. Snider later changed his mind, saying that he had only allowed Trump to use the song because the two were friends, but then respectfully asked Trump to stop using it as he did not agree with many of Trump‚Äôs stances. Snider did not want people to get the impression that he was endorsing Trump or his campaign.   

I think you‚Äôve got to be an absolute idiot to protest against the safety of yourself and others. Although, if there *were* a legitimate case to protest a government mandate of something, I‚Äôd probably use this song too. The lyrics are perfect. 

Lyrics (chorus retracted for brevity)     

We're not gonna take it    
No, we ain't gonna take it    
We're not gonna take it anymore    

We've got the right to choose and there ain't no way we'll lose it    
This is our life, this is our song    
We'll fight the powers that be just, don't pick our destiny 'cause    
You don't know us, you don't belong    

Oh, you're so condescending, your gall is never ending    
We don't want nothing, not a thing, from you    
Your life is trite and jaded, boring and confiscated    
If that's your best, your best won't do    

We're right, yeah    
We're free, yeah    
We'll fight, yeah    
You'll see, yeah    

We're not gonna take it (no!)    
No, we ain't gonna take it    
We're not gonna take it anymore (just you try and make us)    

We're not gonna take it (come on)    
No, we ain't gonna take it (you're all worthless and weak)    
We're not gonna take it anymore (now drop and give me twenty)    

We're not gonna take it (a pledge pin)    
No, we ain't gonna take it (on your uniform)    
We're not gonna take it anymore",,,1600617522,{},g5zr2n7,False,t3_iw5dtc,False,True,t3_iw5dtc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iw5dtc/dee_snider_blasts_unmasked_protesters_for_using/g5zr2n7/,1600686474,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

[],,kall_blome,,,[],,,,text,t2_cty9pbi,False,False,[],"For starters, the air quality on a commercial airliner is actually quite high, with the air volume in the cabin being completely refreshed every two to four minutes. Air flows into the cabin vertically ‚Äî it enters from overhead vents and is sent downward in a circular motion, exiting at floor level. Once air leaves the cabin, about half is dumped outside, and the rest is sent through HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filters, similar to those used in hospitals, before being mixed with fresh outside air and entering the cabin again.

Of course, passengers and crewmembers moving up and down the aisles can disrupt this airflow, altering the path of any airborne particles. And while the HEPA filters used in commercial aviation can filter out 99.97% of virus-sized particles, they can‚Äôt capture every respiratory droplet or viral aerosol before someone else inhales it.

Still, the design of air-handling systems on commercial aircraft makes it unlikely that you‚Äôll be breathing in air from anyone more than a few rows away. In fact, a 2018 study that examined the transmission of droplet-mediated respiratory illnesses during transcontinental flights found that an infectious passenger with influenza or another droplet-transmitted respiratory infection was highly unlikely to infect passengers seated farther away than two seats on either side or one row in front or in back

So again : flying is not the risk (with or without masks )

He could be wrong about this, but all I was saying is that I saw no reason to doubt they have at least tried to be correct.

But okay, I'll make an example on why being wrong about the cause could mean bad things for the company, and I'll even make it super silly because you just dont get the obvious.

[],,Kriztauf,,,[],,,,text,t2_8th3g,False,False,[],"I think that it would have been pretty nasty if more countries had taken the Swedish approach (or what they believed the Swedish approach is) from the beginning. As their public health officials said at the beginning, this was a plan suited specifically for Sweden since it's small population is clustered in only a few larger cities and then many small spread out villages. They still provided aid to support people to stay home if they needed it. They still helped businesses. They still ran into a lot of death concerning their elderly population, who were supposed to be most protected under this plan.

So it may have achieved some of it goals for Sweden and we'll know more in the coming months. It's hard to pass more objective judgement yet, on Sweden itself. Comparisons will be easier between other European countries.

Meanwhile, it should be mentioned that like-minded people in the US have been very interested in the Swedish approach, except a lot of them believe that the Swedish model entails just asking old people to stay home without really providing them much in the way of financial support, and then everyone else goes to work, school, whatever, just like any regular day. And then all the cases would be asymptomatic since the old people are at home (obviously this wouldn't be the case but they don't know/care). And any people that die just die. Life is sad but you move on. To them the Swedish approach is just one step above doing nothing at all, and that is the approach they'd try to take. 

I'm very glad they didn't take that approach seeing how much of a shit show their current plan has been. The US barely squeezed by during its two largest spikes in hospitalizations, which were isolated to only a handful of states both times. PPE and med supplies were especially scarce at the beginning when New York got slammed. I can't imagine if they'd let the infections on the Coasts last spring spread across the country unimpeded despite 'keeping the old people home'. The models from that time show death totals of 2-3 million Americans, which would completely make sense given that the entire nation's healthcare system would have imploded. 

And I guarantee the people advocating for an American equivalent to the Swedish model haven't put much thought into how to provide regular medical care to the elderly people that they are supposedly protecting through isolation. Especially in regards to how to get them this care without unintentionally infecting them via the medical workers traveling in from the pathogen contaminated 'outside world'. There's already a huge doctor shortage and the elderly require a lot of medical resources and help regardless of Covid. You can't just isolate a bunch of doctors with the elderly for the duration of the pandemic while letting everything else run wild. And you can't just assume the elderly will figure it out themselves with their nursing staff. And you can't just isolate the elderly at hospitals incase they need intensive care....because then where the fuck do the covid patients go? There are so many issues here and the US can't even coordinate it's current plan. 

So, my point is, if this approach turns out to have been the least terrible option for Sweden, then good for them. But if it shows benefits and then people outta the US start complaining that they weren't able to give even less of a shit about addressing the pandemic, I'm worried that half the country will just stop addressing the pandemic all together.",,,1600568763,{},g5ws8gu,False,t3_ivyd2e,False,False,t1_g5uuljx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ivyd2e/swedens_coronavirus_pandemic_may_be_finished_says/g5ws8gu/,1600635471,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,1600569241.0,

The hospitals of the Community of Madrid touch the abyss.
-

elDiario.es has had access to occupancy data ‚Äìfor Thursday‚Äì of practically the entire hospital network in the region ‚Äìincluding public and private centers‚Äì. These data reflect the extent to which Madrid's healthcare is beginning to collapse again, after Primary Care has already been overwhelmed for weeks. COVID-19 is advancing in the region and health workers already admit fear of what may be to come. In some hospitals such as October 12, the Gregorio Mara√±√≥n or the Infanta Leonor - the largest - are ""especially stressed"", they defend unions and experts, and there are complete ICUs: not only with coronavirus, but full.

The president of the Community of Madrid, Isabel D√≠az Ayuso, announced this Friday the closure of 37 areas of the region with the highest incidence of cases in the last two weeks. As of Monday, the mobility of almost a million people who will be able to travel to work, go to school or care for dependents, among others, will be limited, but who will not be able to go out for leisure. The affected areas coincide almost entirely with the south of the capital and the region. It is in these areas that hospital occupancy is already very close to its maximum occupancy.

The data accessed by this newspaper reflect that 18 hospitals in Madrid already have an occupancy of over 90% of their capacity (between covid and non-covid patients) and in many ICUs they are at 100%. With this scenario, the operating rooms are once again reconverted into areas to care for the most seriously ill, surgical interventions are suspended and tents are started to attend a wave of patients that are expected in the coming days due to the growing curve in contagions.
-

The public hospitals with the highest occupancy are the G√≥mez Ulla military hospital, which has 97.7% capacity and the ICUs at 100%, followed by the La Paz university hospital with 95.5% occupancy; that of the Southeast with 95.2%; the Infanta Cristina with 94.2% occupation in the plant and 100% in intensive care; Puerta del Hierro with 94.1% and 95.6% of the ICUs; the Infanta Leonor with 93.8% of the plant beds and 100% critical capacity and the University of M√≥stoles with 92.2%.
-

Of the largest hospitals in the capital, the Gregorio Mara√±√≥n, in the heart of the capital, is already 80.8% occupied in the ward and 96.9% in the ICU, and on October 12, next to the districts with the highest incidence are already 81.8% and 85.3%, respectively. Both centers have a capacity of over 1,000 beds.

The G√≥mez Ulla Central Defense Hospital in Madrid, in the district of La Latina - the one with the highest occupancy - installed temporary hospital triage stores this Friday in its parking lot. The G√≥mez Ulla was already one of the hospitals that saw its capacities overwhelmed in the first wave of the pandemic and now, given the increase in cases in Madrid and its capacity already at the limit, it has decided to go ahead by expanding its capacities.

Only in the last day, the Community of Madrid has registered 5,000 new confirmed cases of coronavirus. There are a thousand more than those detected throughout the month of July. Since Spain entered the new normal after the general confinement on June 21, the Community of Madrid has become, week by week, the focus and main center of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In two months it has gone from a cumulative incidence in 14 days of 9 cases per 100,000 inhabitants on July 15 to another of 642 on September 16.
-
This prolonged and exponential growth is already noticeable in hospitals that are on the verge of their real capacity. The regional government always hides itself in the fact that the situation is not like the one in March, and it is right: then the plant beds and intensive care beds were tripled and all kinds of spaces were used. With these data we talk about the beds that are normally available in Madrid hospitals. The figures show that we are once again overflowing with capacity. The greatest concentration occurs in the central and southern areas of the region.
-

In the Community of Madrid, hospitals are at an occupancy level of practically 80% (in the rest of the country, excluding Madrid, it is 70%). and 18 of 59 hospitals in Madrid are currently at an occupancy rate of over 90%, while 37 of them have an occupancy rate of over 80%, according to figures from July 16.


If we only attend to beds occupied by Covid patients, Madrid is the autonomy with the highest percentage: 22%, when the national average is 8.5%. It is also very far from the second with the highest saturation in hospitals, which is Castilla-La Mancha (13%), according to the latest daily report from the Ministry of Health on September 16. The worst is in the ICU.
-

The pressure on the health system has overflowed in the health centers and now lines up the Intensive Care Units. It is the next indicator, together with hospitalizations, to measure the evolution of the second wave. As of September 16, 371 people were already admitted in critical condition.

According to data by hospitals, in intensive care the occupation in public centers in Madrid is already at 87% of its capacity, a figure that is far from that offered by those responsible for the Ministry of Health who defend that it is 40%. Between public and private, this occupancy drops to 79%, but it is still double that offered by the department of Enrique Ruiz Escudero.
-

Workers' Commissions explains that the Ministry includes to calculate the proportion occupied ICU beds all those available in these auxiliary units that are usually full when the surgeries work at full capacity. The health workers of various hospitals in the south of Madrid with whom elDiario.es has spoken agree that the problem is not the space ‚Äìreformed in most centers during the first wave‚Äì, but the lack of professionals. A part has not yet returned from the holidays and the job boards are exhausted, according to the unions. Which puts professionals back in a situation of stress and alert.

New restrictive measures
-

The Madrid president announced this Friday the partial confinement in 37 areas of the region most affected by the pandemic in this second wave. For at least two weeks, more than 850,000 people will see their ability to move autonomously restricted, among other capacity limitation measures. ""What we have detected is that there are 37 areas throughout the Community of Madrid where the incidence is much higher. We are talking about 1,000 infections per 100,000 inhabitants, a very serious figure. We are obliged to take a series of measures to contain the spread of the virus "", said the Madrid president.

One of the measures proposed by President Isabel D√≠az Ayuso is to reopen the Ifema field hospital, which would mean the recognition that Madrid's health system is no longer able to supply more than four months after having closed it with a party in the one that the Madrilenian president boasted of management and caused an inexplicable agglomeration.

I just want to note that this is only in the United States.

In the United States, schools are primarily funded from property taxes, so the amount of funding per student is less in the poorer districts.

I moved to Europe and it took me quite a while to understand that here, they spend _more_ money per student in poor districts!  

It was an interview with a teacher in Amsterdam's poorest neighborhood.  He mentioned that he was on a waiting list for years to get in - that working in this school in the ""slums"" was very much in demand because ""Here you can really make a difference in a kid's life.""  He talked specifically about the larger budgets - ""Often both parents are working or one just isn't in the picture.  Often the reason that the family is poor is that they are uneducated.  The school necessarily has to take over part of the parenting.""  (This is paraphrased from an article I read in Dutch, which I'm not perfect at...)

As he pointed out, there are sound economic reasons for it - educated people can be of benefit to society.  ""People will always be poor but we can make sure their children have a fair chance.""

Testing more has only ever revealed more cases/deaths. I still have no idea why you think it'd somehow be different for Sweden.

&gt;But the impact of a pandemic that mainly kills the old has a lot to do with the buildup of vulnerable people.

Based on the effect whose terminology you used wrongly?

'In 2019, there were fewer than 89 000 deaths, which was the lowest number of deaths in a single year since 1977. In 2018, when exceptionally many people died from the influenza, there were more than 92 000 deaths in Sweden.'

Even if we take your effect as true, Sweden's excess death toll of ~5.5-6k for the peak period of their outbreak far exceeds the difference to be explained by your theory.

Where did you make that point?

&gt;We will see what the third quarter has to say about many of the countries that continued their lockdowns.

The aforementioned countries were already out of lockdown before Q3. 

&gt;Is precedent a guarantee of justice?

I'm not even going to bother with your irrelevant spiel. Your point that lockdowns or quarantines have never existed in the West before has already been proven wrong. Here are even more examples of the West doing so:

Researchers at Karolinska Institutet and Science for Life Laboratory in Sweden and Tor Vergata University of Rome in Italy have mapped the immune response in children affected by a rare but life-threatening inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19. The study, which is published in the scientific journal Cell, reveals that the inflammatory response differs from that in Kawasaki disease and severe acute COVID-19.

In the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with very few exceptions, children have presented with mild symptoms. However, paediatricians have discovered a new, life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome resembling Kawasaki disease and named Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children associated with COVID-19, MIS-C (see box).
In a new collaborative study, researchers have worked out the immunological aspects of this rare condition. They compared blood samples from 13 MIS-C-patients treated at Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden and Bambino Ges√π Children‚Äôs Hospital in Rome, Italy, with samples from 28 Kawasaki disease patients collected from 2017 to 2018, prior to COVID-19. The analyses also included samples from children with mild COVID-19.

Differs from other inflammatory states

‚ÄúOur results show that MIS-C is truly a distinct inflammatory condition from Kawasaki disease, despite having some shared features,‚Äù says¬†Petter Brodin, paediatrician and researcher at the¬†Department of Women‚Äôs and Children‚Äôs Health, Karolinska Institutet, and one lead author of the study. ‚ÄúThe hyperinflammation and cytokine storm detected in children with MIS-C is also different from that seen in adult patients with severe, acute COVID-19, which we recently described in¬†another publication.‚Äù
When comparing MIS-C to these other inflammatory states, the study observed differential frequency of specific immune cell populations, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the blood. Unlike children with Kawasaki disease and children with mild COVID-19, children who developed MIS-C were lacking IgG-antibodies to common cold coronaviruses. The researchers also found several autoantibodies that target the body‚Äôs own proteins and that may contribute to the pathogenesis of MIS-C. They are now also looking into genetic risk factors for developing MIS-C after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Adding a piece to the puzzle

‚ÄúThere is an urgent need to better understand why a small minority of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop MIS-C, and we are adding a piece to the puzzle,‚Äù says Dr Brodin. ‚ÄúBetter knowledge of the pathogenesis is important for development of optimal treatments that can dampen the cytokine storm and hopefully save lives, as well as for vaccine development to avoid MIS-C caused by vaccination.‚Äù
The study was a collaborative effort led by Petter Brodin and his team at Science for Life Laboratory and Karolinska Institutet, together with Nils Landegren‚Äôs group at KI and Paolo Palma‚Äôs lab at Tor Vergata University of Rome. It was financed by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (KAW), Bure Equity AB, Jonas and Christina af Jochnick Foundation, the SciLifeLab/KAW national COVID-19 research program project grant, the Bambino Ges√π Children‚Äôs Hospital, 5 X mille 2019, and Ricerca Corrente 2020. The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.

Kawasaki disease and MIS-C

In March and April 2020, paediatricians in Italy, France and the UK noted an increased incidence of children presenting with symptoms resembling those of Kawasaki disease, a severe inflammatory condition that mainly affects children under 5 years of¬†age. However, children affected by hyperinflammation after being infected by SARS-CoV-2 differed from patients with classical Kawasaki disease in that they were older and often presented with more severe disease. The new, life-threatening syndrome was named Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C). It presents 4-6 weeks after infection as high fever, organ dysfunction and strongly elevated markers of inflammation. Both Kawasaki disease and MIS-C are conditions where a misdirected immune response elicited by a virus leads to autoimmune attack on normal proteins in tissues such as the heart and blood vessels.",,,1600613322,{},g5zhuzs,False,t3_iwdnlr,False,True,t3_iwdnlr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iwdnlr/rare_hyperinflammatory_syndrome_in_children_with/g5zhuzs/,1600681978,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

It helps much to dispel all the fantasies some of you might be having about going to the movies as soon as the vaccine is out, which are *not* realistic. Yes, it's from MarketWatch, but this guy's a doctor and vaccine developer, and knows what he's doing. I agree with what Offit is saying 100%. Here are some highlights:

* ""**I never imagined it would be this bad.** Looking at what happened in China, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, I was looking at the size of those countries compared with the size of our country, and I thought there is no way this virus is going to be worse than the flu this year."" - Offit's ""come-to-Jesus moment"" of the virus's seriousness
* ""...you cannot truncate the Phase 3 trials. That is the proof that cannot be short-circuited. What I worry about is ... an 'October surprise' ‚Äî that the government would find a way to truncate that trial, declare victory, and put it out there. Watching what happened with hydroxychloroquine, watching what happened with convalescent plasma, watching what happens with climate change and the EPA, **the government has shown its capacity to impose its will on science-based federal agencies. There is a reason to worry.**"" - Offit on the Trump Administration's influence on public health agencies and vaccine development
* ""Even if it‚Äôs highly effective, it‚Äôs still not going to be a sure shot. If you get 75%, that means one out of every four people who get it could still get moderate to severe disease, which can cause them to be hospitalized or die, **which is why they‚Äôre still going to need to wear a mask.** It will probably be a greater percentage more than 25% who could still get either mild infections or asymptomatic infections or they could still shed and be contagious.""
* ""Yes ‚Äî for a couple of years and doing the best we can to social distance. We can go back to school, as long as we do the kinds of things they‚Äôve done in Denmark and other countries that have been able to do this successfully. We just don‚Äôt have that kind of federal leadership, sadly. **People now see vaccines as a magic dust that‚Äôs about to be sprinkled over this country and make this all go away.** It doesn‚Äôt work that way.""",,,1600612450,{},g5zfovj,True,t3_iwewda,False,True,t3_iwewda,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iwewda/philadelphia_pediatrician_paul_offit_prepare_to/g5zfovj/,1600681017,-16,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Uhg, no way. What kind of thinking is that?  Even if you are completely unempatic it's still a problem for trade exports and travel.

I read about lockdowns and quarantines enforced with high fines or jail penalties in other countries, people getting caught by closed borders and refused basic freedoms or in some places compensation for food. As a swede it seem crazy and terrifying to me, meanwhile most of reddit acts like a the hay and pitchfork mob to any and all that are not complying to the (in my views) draconian rules.

I'm glad our response was a reasonable with sound science backing it. That it was design to address the average spread in the population rather than targetting everybody with laws. It was known you most likely survive if you get it - just slow down spread so healthcare wasnt overwhelmed, protect thoes around you by distancing as much you can.

And, most importantly, there is an issue of social stigma: sick people donot want to be stigmatized so would avoid wearing masks if at all possible.

1. We need to address the increasingly advanced age of our representation/age demographics need to be more reflected in congressional make-up.

2. We need to address term limitations and how career politicians and backdoor lobbyists use and abuse the existing rules.

3. We need to address the Supreme Court. It is absurd that the highest legal organ is so subject to the whims of whoever may be in office at the time. Whether the solution is a permanent civilian watchdog a la jury duty, or to neutralize potential tampering by increasing the number of justices to 11 or 13 or even 91, *something* must be done with urgency.

From there we need to address the state of democracy. We're past the 2000s. We can't just live in the post-bush years until nuclear war happens. 

If that means we need government sponsored youth technology, literacy, and multi-lingual educational standards and programs then so be it. I don't even know what material impacts my tax dollars have besides medicare/ss/unemployment and I work in taxes. That sounds like a cool use of it.

We also need to modernize voting. If two teenagers from Florida can hack the president's Twitter account, and the president's Twitter account is official, we need to go a step further and have the official US Citizen smartphone app. You vote, you register, acceptable as ID, still private property by the same statute establishing this new branch of the government responsible for administrating this app to ensure its integrity and modernizing american citizenship so we can stay competitive on the global stage.

You think that they dont employ people and create wealth because you haven't bothered to look into what actually makes up that wealth and what that wealth means. Because it doesn't mean they can buy anything worth that much.

It's funny because even the people with the most money couldn't all distribute it to make everyone as equally wealthy as they already are. Because if they didn't have that wealth, all the jobs they create would go with it. It's dynamic, not static. In other words, their wealth is made up of the people who've invested in the companies they own, and how much profit is made.

If theres plenty of labor available for these people post covid, why dont you go tell them to find it? Or do you think that the government will magically pay their way to self isolation? 

By the way, 1.98 trillion divided by the us pop is roughly 6k. So if you wanted to equally divide the ""plenty of wealth"" among every US citizen for a month until you realize theres no money left and no one to give the money to for goods in exchange, then go for it. Not to mention that you'd have to literally take everyone's money all at once. Which wouldn't go well.

I'm sorry, but dealing with this problem by locking down is not the only solution.

I worked in ""big pharma"" in vaccine development for a looooonnnggg time.  

&gt;On the profit making of COVID related vaccine and treatment, they don't get much for this type of disease to balance out development cost

The development cost has been largely covered by the governments of the world.  Whether it's Oxford's governmental funding or Operation Warp Speed.

&gt;Even for Remdesivir charging $2500. If COVID is 'gone like the flu' in a few months, they will lose big. 

Remdesivir is a repurposed drug.  It's a broad spectrum antiviral.  It's been around since 2009 and has been used for other viruses.  Not just SARS-CoV-2.

&gt;You make way more if you work on other stuff that's 5k a pill and won't be competing with 100+ other vaccines with a late start.

The vast majority of vaccines will never go anywhere.  There aren't realistically 100+ vaccines in the pipelines that will make it to market.  There are around 5-6 that will make it to market globally.  

&gt;The new technologies are a different story. They're close, but still far from ready for market.

Again, you don't know what you're talking about.  Moderna already had vaccine candidates that completed Phase II.  They weren't far from ready for the market.  They certainly weren't 5-10 years off.  

&gt;You don't want to 'reconfigure existing'. It's much easier and faster to mass produce some RNAs de novo than go through the whole culture and kill process.

Yet, that's exactly what Moderna is doing.  They are reconfiguring existing by partnering with Lonza for manufacturing.  It's not like Lonza was setup for mass producing RNAs.  And it's not just mass producing RNAs.  There aren't many facilities right now that can handle a vaccine like Moderna's.  Not even Sanofi can handle the scale needed.

Also, I‚Äôm sure other users would appreciate if you didn‚Äôt tag them in your comments.  

u/ReginaldJohnston What happened? Where‚Äôd you go? Did you click on the credible source I provided and see that I was actually right? 

Btw, you don‚Äôt have to use *Your Excellency* because the US literally moved away from that 244 years ago. We‚Äôd rather our heads of government not be elected by only one constituency.

I understand that exposure to what the media puts out and the stress of the pandemic are triggers. They can be triggers for me.

Don't most people realize that we live in a fear based society ? That the media is just the means they use to spread that fear ? Outside of the covid, racially things didn't just suddenly get worse or better. The media just started pushing stories that would stir things up, then blow the results of those stories out of proportion. They get to start the fire, sit back and watch it grow, then use the big fire as fuel to make it even bigger. This is a well orchestrated plan, it gets people thinking that the sky is falling, the more people believe it, the worse things get but they are never as bad as the general media presents it or would have us believe.

As far as the covid, deaths aren't even making headlines, just New cases. Why ? Because the deaths overall are down so they just focus on college towns where young people will congregate. Yeah many will contract covid but the vast majority will recover, most with mild symptoms. The media just looks for or makes up the biggest scariest news to cover. 

I understand that the media is shoving all of this negativity down our throats. Even if you don't watch the news it'll still affect you, through other people, through state and federal mandates, etc. I could go on but I don't want to politicize this.

The song is what it is, It didn‚Äôt evolve after covid.  Dee can‚Äôt put it back in the bottle and pretend it didn‚Äôt mean what it means nor control how it is used.  Perhaps he outgrew his own song.  The song itself is against even him telling people how to use it.

It‚Äôs the ultimate non-communal, non-conforming anthem.  

Lyrics:

Oh, we're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
Oh, we're not gonna take it anymore
We've got the right to choose it
There ain't no way we'll lose it
This is our life, this is our song
We'll fight the powers that be, just
Don't pick our destiny 'cause
You don't know us, you don't belong
Oh, we're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
Oh, we're not gonna take it anymore
Oh, you're so condescending
Your gall is never ending
We don't want nothin', not a thing from you
Your life is trite and jaded
Boring and confiscated
If that's your best, your best won't do
Whoa, oh oh
Whoa, oh oh
We're right (yeah)
We're free (yeah)
We'll fight (yeah)
You'll see (yeah)
Whoa, whoa, we're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
Oh, we're not gonna take it anymore‚Ä¶",,,1600616975,{},g5zpv8n,False,t3_iw5dtc,False,True,t3_iw5dtc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iw5dtc/dee_snider_blasts_unmasked_protesters_for_using/g5zpv8n/,1600685861,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Also, long-shot:  how common has it been for you, if at all, to be able to take a COVID test at your destination (most likely at the airport) and be given the option for not having to quarantine for 2 weeks?",,,1600623126,{},g603fo8,False,t3_iwd6fr,False,False,t1_g600qji,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iwd6fr/nearly_11000_people_have_been_exposed_to_the/g603fo8/,1600693151,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

That is my point.  Finland tested more, and therefore identifies the true lower rate of infection.  Sweden recently tested a significant random sample of the population and found a lower rate of background infection than anyone anticipated.

&gt;I'm sure it's just some magical coincidence that their excess death spike perfectly aligned with the duration of the outbreak, right?

No, that's when the Coronavirus happened.  But the impact of a pandemic that mainly kills the old has a lot to do with the buildup of vulnerable people.

Even after taking this into account, you will still find that Norway beats Sweden by a few horse lengths.  But for a sense of proportion, compare the wider difference between Brazil and Peru.

&gt;Did Sweden not see a similar increase [in economic downturns]?

""No difference"" is my point, and not yours.  You posted ""so people stop posting the misinformation that countries that went into lock down are automatically doing much worse.""  As if I was saying that Sweden's neighbors were doing worse.  I have already said ""I think that the policy makes very little difference, at least in the short term.""

We will see what the third quarter has to say about many of the countries that continued their lockdowns.

&gt;Your narrative that there have been no precedent is simply false.

Is precedent a guarantee of justice?  Precedent, of course, is a word that has to be used when reminding people of history that people have forgotten, or choose to forget.  America has a precedent of concentration camps and ethnic cleansing.  Indeed, it has found a use of facial masks, for their guests at Guantanamo bay:

There clearly are!  The UK suffered the most deaths on a week on record.  Sweden recorded its highest death tally in 150 years in the first half of 2020. Sweden's excess deaths are about the same as its recorded deaths.  What counts as a 'large margin'?!

And what has that got to do with your original claim that actual deaths were way lower than recorded deaths, when excess deaths are either in line with recorded deaths or higher?

It is not about sucking it up, but its about learning how to cope with said situation and the inevitable. I bought up my situation to simply say that its not ideal but you can and will do this. Your greiving won't stop once you leave the hospital, many even have miscarriages at home and never need to go to the hospital especially early miscarriages those women are often alone with no support system. None of this is about sucking it up butter cup rather than about mentally preparing for this situation that you may have to give birth, or experience loss on your own. Your spouse or your support system can die tomorrow and if you are forced to do this alone you will have to do it because you cant have said person around, with regulations if you are forced to do it alone than you will have to.

Your truama doesnt end right after delivery, nor does it end the moment you step out of the hospital. You will still have your spouse afterwords (if you are fortunate to have spouse around) does it make the situation better no, but like I said if that is what is being brought upon me then I need to do what I need to do to survive.

Yeah it's never happen a large outbreak didn't origin in nature.

And there are like trillions of natural viruses out there.

Haha I worked in labs, and it's routine and everyday to tamper with genes for like bacteria. It's just a traning thing that takes two days.

I didn't work with viruses though. But you can tamper with genes for all organisms - it's just amino acids. I talked to a guy 30 years ago, and his lab was working on inserting spider genes into beans. To make them more resistant to cold or something.

I think more that the people who believe in this con woman are  people who just discovered scientists can tamper with genes, so they are soooo shocked about that.

That scientists can tampwe with genes for mice and viruses, it does not mean any mice you come across was tampered with lol. Like viruses, they origin in nature, and you'd want some strong evidence to even care about a guy that claimed he found a mouse that was man made.

It depends on where you live entirely.  In San Francisco, rent on a one-bedroom apartment averaged an astonishing $3074 a month in August - and that is _down_ from before the pandemic.

The tax rate is usually somewhere over 1/3, again depending on where you live.  So if you made $56K in San Francisco, and you had an average 1 bedroom, ALL your money would go on rent!

In order to afford that average one bedroom, you'd probably need to earn around $150k.  

New York City was almost as expensive though it's pretty soft now after the pandemic.

To give you an example, New York City has almost 19 million residents, Indonesia 270 million - a dozen times as many people.  But the GDP of Indonesia is just over a trillion dollars - that of New York City is $1.5 trillion.

Life is probably better in Indonesia.  I don't live in New York City anymore, at least partly because it's so ugly almost everywhere.

So you can't use that massive brain of yours and come to the conclution that Sweden was hit much harder in the start of the pandemic, like our neighbours...
That's the reality, in februari we have sports vacation (which you should know being a Swedish covid-19 expert) and people usally go to itally, spain, up north etc. In other words covid hotspots.

My guess is that new Zeeland doesnt have this tradition, which lessened the impact of the pandemic in the start.
Which made it more managable.

And continuing your statment, again....
Dont you think Sweden got hit as hard as it did because of how the pandemic started?
Its almost like Sweden is different from its neighbours and new Zeeland........

&gt;Based on which official government body again?

Our constitution....


&gt;Just look at the excess death spike for each country. Sweden's is far worse than its neighbours.

Dude, are you a troll?
Can't you see a correlation with under mortality one year (years) and then a massive spike the next year?
Not that alot of people died of covid in Sweden, we obviously have had alot of deaths.
The actual death till will most likely be around 15% of what the actual number is, ~1000 is my guess of actuall death by covid-19 symptoms.

&gt;How exactly? None of the data support your claims.

So you actually read what you link?
Dude.... Are you for real?

The 2019 service export for the named nations:
Sweden: ~$76 billion
New Zealand: ~$25 billion
Finland: ~$9.5 billion
Norway: ~$44.4 billion
Denmark (2018): ~$69.5 billion

Sweden has almost as much export of services as new Zealand, finland and norway combined...
And everyone whos not econolically illiterate would know that the service sector would be hit the hardest in a pandemic.

So dont what you're on about....

&gt;Right, and that's why I've compared with Sweden's immediate neighbours too?

Compare Sweden to a similar nation atleast, belgium is a good example....
GDP is almost identical.
Similar population size.
Similar economic structure (beligum is more service oriented, might be one reason why they got hit so hard).
Similar movement of people, because of how globalized their economies are.

Again, its like you're copy pasting random data without putting any thought into it....

&gt;How you got hit in the beginning has to do with your response.

We got hit gard in the beginning because swedes was out and traveling in februari...
I wont argue that our goverment was slow in inacting restrictions, but that couldn't have stopped the massive wave  we had in the beginning.

&gt;Also, I've substantiated all of my claims with sources/data. If I'm telling obvious lies, feel free to point it out.

The point, as i made before is that your data is shit...
There is zero actual thought behind it...
I said service export, which is the sector that mainly got hurt by a trade stop/pandemic.
And the you linked be some general export stats, which is irrlevant...
Of course norway will be hit less in their GDP compared to Sweden, norway sells oil, people need oil regardless of there is a pandemic or war...

Sweden sells services, engineering, banking etc
No one want that during a economic crisis...

Or do you disagree?

&gt;Meanwhile, where are your sources to corroborate all the claims you've made? Oh wait, you have none.

That means jack shit.
Its like when Trump says that chlorine kills covid-19, which it might do. Because some dumb ass doctor said so...

You have to be critical of the data you link and make sure its actually relevant to the discussion.
Which you havent done.

And then you totally ignored the fact that Swedish over reporting of covid mortality, probably because it goes against your feeling...
