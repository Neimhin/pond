First of all what do you think the compliance with mask requirements is ? Simple common sense says that the more masks the merrier and the safer it would be. Mask compliance varies from place to place.

Secondly, masks or no masks, the more crowded a vehicle is the more likely it becomes that there will be disease transmission. I think that you are very correct in attributing at least some of the problem to running above capacity. How could it be otherwise ?

In quite a few cities elsewhere there have been [few exposure incidents that can be traced to public transit](https://medical.mit.edu/covid-19-updates/2020/09/how-safe-public-transportation).

A variant with high enough R0 could begin to spread again if waning immunity outpaces  the vaxes/boosters/natural infection growth.  

Delta has an R0 of 7.5, which means a population must be 87% protected to prevent spread via herd immunity.  We're pretty close to that in the US on average, but some states are much less.

So basically, figure out which strain of the virus is the most prominent, determine it's R0 and figure out what % of the population is protected.  OG Covid had an R0 of 2.5, so you only needed 60% of the population protected to get to herd immunity.  If we had a much more virulent strain, like with R0 of 16, then we need 94% of the population to be protected.  

Personally, I think Delta is the last ""huge"" wave.  We'll have regional/subregional spikes but as long as we keep vaccinating/boosting, I don't think the population protection % will drop far enough to prevent a lot of new spread, unless some super fit strain comes around.",,,,1633666203,{},hfteq5o,False,t3_q33gn1,False,True,t1_hfsp8ly,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q33gn1/daily_discussion_thread_october_07_2021/hfteq5o/,1633795698.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think this is a much larger proportion of the population than gets talked about.

But for what I would guess (based on anecdotal observation here in NY) is a pretty big chunk of vaccinated Americans, they've just quietly returned to a mostly normal life.

Medicine in the military is quick to adopt new techniques and procedures if they find it works.

Tourniquets for example were phased out of use in civilian sector a while back and there is still some lingering fear of using a tourniquet among medical professionals in the civilian side. In the military ALL of us know how to use a tourniquet, because that saves lives. The civilian sector has just started to take on tourniquet use again. 

OK so COVID is not trauma. I know. The military also has really great preventative medicine (much better than the civilian sector). Additionally, various diseases were researched using military funds and personnel in the past, malaria and yellow fever for example. A ton of vaccines that I get and have given to others are not even looked at in the civilian sector (yellow fever vaccine). 

I do agree, however, the COVID vaccine is seen as the best option for the troops at this time as it reduces hospitalization rates of the infected. That I think is the main thought behind mandatory vaccination.

Do you think Swedes were more inclined to die from Covid than the other Scandinavians or was the healthcare worse?,,,,1633685165,{},hfu2ptj,False,t3_q2kf7f,False,True,t1_hfqk2pn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q2kf7f/denmark_pauses_use_of_moderna_covid_vaccine_for/hfu2ptj/,1633808877.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What I mean by that is, you can look at past data all you want, but trending data is much more important when referring to future outcomes. When we vaccinated older/immunocompromised people first, the virus moved into younger populations (40-65), when we vaccinated that age group we started seeing an uptick in the group below that, and so it has persisted.

Most recently with the Delta variant, we have seen an uptick in reported cases in U12 age groups (and we have to consider cases are always an order of magnitude higher than official reports). So, if those previous trends in demographic transmissibility are any indication of viral adaptation, we are in for some pretty serious early childhood disease if we don't put a plug in this anti-vaccine rhetoric within the next few months.

However if an unvaccinated person who is denied an exemption doesn't resign and goes through the disciplinary process, they will not only lose their job, but my company will challenge their unemployment application.  

The way I see it, it is a shit situation for everyone involved.  Some people, rightfully or wrongfully, distrust the government and mass media.  There is so much misinformation out there and some people are going to get caught up in it.  I sympathize.  The people who have or are about to lose their jobs deserve to get unemployment.  One of the issues I have with this is that if your employer rejects your religious exemption application, then there is no appeal.  Who is my employer to decide if these people's religious beliefs are genuine?  Personally, I believe that if someone is willing to put their career at risk, then it's pretty damn sincere.  These people continued to work during the pandemic and due to their misinformation, distrust, and general confusion; they are about to go through financial hardship. Just because someone is scared, distrustful, or just plain dumb, does not mean that they are any less deserving of help during their time of need.  

Employers do not want to lose qualified team members.  In my industry, it takes several months to get a clearance and about another 8 months to get qualified in most positions.

The idea is especially alluring to anybody making an effort to be careful and feeling frustrated that so many other Americans seem blasé. After all, the Covid fable does have an some truth to it. Social distancing and masking do reduce the spread of the virus. They just are not as powerful as people often imagine.

The main determinants of Covid’s spread (other than vaccines, which are extremely effective) remain mysterious. Some activities that seem dangerous, like in-person school or crowded outdoor gatherings, may not always be. As unsatisfying as it is, we do not know why cases have recently plunged. The decline is consistent with the fact that Covid surges often last for about two months before receding, but that’s merely a description of the data, not a causal explanation.

I’m a Covid nurse. I had a vaxxed patient last week. It was my first one, so it was memorable. He actually went home fairly quickly. He hadn’t gotten the booster and was vaxxed very early on. (Plus, he was very advanced in his years and had diabetes, which he hadn’t been controlling. Plus, he was obese and didn’t control his BP. Etc.) But he did fine and went home. He actually left on room air, which is unusual for our patients. Even the young guys normally have to go home on an oxygen bottle. 

All my other patients have been unvaccinated. 

I wish everyone could do a couple shifts in a Covid unit and watch exactly what these people go through. In short, it’s freaking terrible. It’s terrible enough to watch it, let alone experience it. It’s not fair. It eats the young too. It eats athletes who have never been hospitalized in their lives. You feel for them. The fact that they’re unvaccinated makes it not one bit easier to watch them suffer and realizing that their lives are entirely changed, perhaps forever. People regularly rip off their oxygen, because they’re just so miserable and want to escape the torture. It makes a nurse feel pretty darn guilty. 

We have no magic drugs. We feel super helpless. We don’t know the answers to the questions, such as ‘will I ever be able to work the same job I did before? Or will I be on oxygen forever? How will I support my kids now?’ And ‘why me? My brothers/cousins/friends/etc all got the virus and didn’t get this sick. So why me.’ We do not know. 

I feel like it’s largely useless to explain to people that they really don’t want to go through this crap. Vaccines aren’t perfect. I did have a vaxxed patient last week, after all! But the vaccines seem to up one’s chances *significantly*. And it’s not life versus death. There’s a huge range of middle ground. Most of us don’t wanna live on a bottle or with the horrible impact of the blood clots and anoxia (lost limbs, kidney damage, brain damage, heart damage, etc.) 
I wish everyone could see it, because it sucks when people are regretting their decision to not get vaxxed.

I like this quote from Dr. Haseltine of Harvard Medical School, from back in August:

&gt;We have underestimated the force that is SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on global society since the beginning. Our miscalculation of everything from how the virus spreads to how much it can adapt and change has led to the loss of millions of lives worldwide, with infections and deaths still on the rise to this day. You think we would have learned our lesson by now—and yet in the face of increasingly dangerous variants, a rhetoric of relentless optimism undergirded by complacency and inaction continues to cloud our better judgment.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last year, neither the first appearance of the virus in Wuhan in late 2019 nor the dire situation that capsized Italy in March and April 2020 constituted a wake up call. Only after the first waves of Covid-19 cases hit Europe and the United States hard did either population begin to take the pandemic more seriously. This year, once again, the catastrophic outbreaks that slammed through India this past spring didn’t seem to be a sufficient warning that worse was to come.

We've left them in place since covid since merv13 is virus or at least vector particle rated.  I've seen a number of health departments in the Northwest release videos of how to setup a merv 13 (or higher) on a single box fan.  The most simple way is to tape the filter to the box fan.  These videos have mostly been for dealing with smoke due to wildfires, but as mentioned merv 13 (or higher) also help filter out some virus and/or vector particles.  


If you want to reduce stress on the fan motor make box so the filter is a few inches away from the side of the fan, the example below by mmmegan6 is a pretty hefty version with 5 filters.  Do note: each filter increase in merv level (merv 14, merv 15, etc) makes your fan work harder if you don't have a large enough air gap between the fan and the filter.  Merv 13 should be enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Even the simple fan+tape+filter can clear out wildfire smoke in a small bed room in 30-60 minutes, we used 2 fan setups to clear up and keep the smoke down during fire/smoke season.  Finally made a wood box enclosure so we can drop in a filter without the need for duct tape, also adds some air gap to reduce stress on the fan motor.

Some people have a hard time resolving the messages, ""The virus hardly affect kids!"" while at the same time getting told about the pretty scary vaccine side effect, myocarditis, that affects kids, especially males, age 12+ (actually up to age 39) the most. If you don't put any numbers behind those facts, it seems obvious to conclude that kids shouldn't get the vaccine. But not so fast -- the CDC looked carefully to make sure that all age groups still should be getting the vaccine -- and the risk of the virus still outweighs the benefit you get from the vaccine despite the rare vaccine side effect, even for males in this age group. The numbers are that myocarditis is happening at a rate of 40 per million for Pfizer, while for Covid-induced myocarditis it's 450 per million (and myocarditis is not the only among many serious possible Covid symptoms).

Ten-fold? It's probably not that bad, but no one really knows.

Like another comment said, it is not uncommon for some viruses to be able to infect more than one species, that's kind of how this whole thing with COVID-19 got started. Compared to if it only could infect humans, sure, it is worse if other animals can get COVID-19, but no one knows how significant it is. At this point, it isn't something to worry about.

[],,Synonyms26,,,[],,,,text,t2_10wdsu,False,False,[],"HÀ NỘI —  Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính has pledged support measures to help migrant workers who are desperate to return to their hometowns after many months of severe lockdown in the southern provinces.  

Over the past several days, provinces and cities have tried to organise safe passage for the thousands trying to return to their home provinces in the north, but problems have occurred. 

The main obstacles have been managing the huge crowds, who are often travelling in convoy, along the long road north. Many travellers are the elderly or children, carrying their worldly possessions on old motorbikes unfit for purpose. 

The official dispatch No 1314/CĐ-TTg, issued on Thursday, said that after a long period of Directive 16 social distancing, many people in HCM City and southern provinces want to return to their hometowns. This is a legitimate desire that should be facilitated, but if not well organised it risks COVID-19 spreading to many localities throughout the country.

To control the pandemic, while ensuring that people can safely return to their hometown, Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính requested that:

1. Provinces and cities ensure that the transportation of people is facilitated faster and more smoothly, without causing congestion at the control checkpoints.

2. In localities where the pandemic has not been completely controlled, but social distancing has been relaxed, authorities should actively encourage people to remain in place for now. For those who still want to return to their hometown, the authorities must notify the relevant authorities at the destination, so arrangements can be made. At gateway checkpoints to provinces or cities, those trying to return to their hometown must ensure epidemiological safety at all times. Those manning these checkpoints must contact the authorities at the intended destination and arrange safe means of transport for those without vehicles, or the elderly, pregnant women and children in need.

3. Provinces and cities along the route of travel are responsible for coordinating traffic and logistical support, if necessary. The destination province and city are responsible for taking measures to ensure pandemic prevention and control is adhered to.

4. The Ministry of Health (MoH) will allocate vaccines, giving priority to the provinces that have the most people returning from pandemic areas. The MoH and the Ministry of National Defense Support will also be on hand to support any localities that discover new COVID-19 cases as a result of returnees from the south. 

Reports from Cửu Long (Mekong) Delta provinces showed that in the past few days, each province has received thousands of people returning from HCM City, Bình Dương, Đồng Nai and Long An.

Testing has discovered some COVID-19 cases. An Giang province received 40,000 people, of which 190 tested positive. Kiên Giang Province received 32,000 people and 122 of them were positive.

HCM City offers support

On Thursday, the HCM City Department of Transport began offering support to those wishing to return home. Those in need can register on the department’s portal.

The request must be made at least two days before departure. Those requesting assistance will be sent an email by the department, informing them if their request has been successful. If their application is not accepted, the department will explain the reasons why.

The southern city of Cần Thơ has issued their own guidance to people returning from pandemic areas; those who have received two doses of vaccine, or recovered from COVID-19 within the last six months, can supervise their health at home.

People that have only received one dose of vaccine must self-quarantine, though they will be provided with 15kg of rice per person.

People that have yet to receive any vaccine must go to collective quarantine centres for 14 days. They will be provided with financial support of VNĐ80,000 (US$3.5) per person per day.

The city has 37 collective quarantine centres which can receive more than 6,300 people.— VNS",,,,1633705197,{},hfv0fjf,True,t3_q3zgb1,False,True,t3_q3zgb1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q3zgb1/vietnam_thousands_attempting_to_return_from/hfv0fjf/,1633826713.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study A - Unvaccinated individuals who became reinfected and Vaccinated individuals who ALL (100%) had a previous infection and became reinfected

OR 

Study B - Unvaccinated individuals who became reinfected and Vaccinated individuals who may or may not (ie &lt; 100%) have had a previous infection and became infected

Which study is more applicable to you? I think you want Study A but I don’t know.

If you want Study A then that’s exactly what this study contains but you keep rejecting it:

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm

“Kentucky **residents aged ≥18 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) or antigen test results**i† reported in Kentucky’s National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) during March–December 2020 **were eligible for inclusion.**”

Out of curiosity, you seem to think it’s easy for them to adjust the results of a study to account for certain factors but you won’t accept one of the options above because you think it’s impossible for them to account for an outside factor?  Do I have that correct?  If so, why do you think adjusting for masks/social distancing is possible but the other adjustments aren’t?

I’m not a professional researcher, nor do you appear to be despite the posturing, so I don’t know what is or isn’t possible to account for but once I know exactly what you’re looking for I can go about finding research that demonstrates it (assuming you once again dismiss the study above).

I think one interesting difference in our perspectives is that I am in the US and you’re maybe in the UK?  In the US we don’t have a central database of infections like that (at least not that I’m aware of) and HIPAA prevents the unauthorized disclosure of medical information to a 3rd party.

This next quote is talking about travel but I imagine the system it describes is similar enough to what you’re talking about to be comparable:

“If you are traveling with documentation of recovery, you must present paper or electronic copies of your positive test result (dated no more than 90 days ago) and a signed letter, on official letterhead that contains the name, address, and phone number of a licensed healthcare provider or public health official, stating that you have been cleared to end isolation and therefore can travel. A letter that states that you have been cleared to end isolation to return to work or school is also acceptable. The letter does not have to specifically mention travel.”

Proof of a positive test is required and an “official letter” from a doctor clearing you to end isolation.  That letter could easily be forged and, due to HIPAA, it’s completely unverifiable without patient consent (which obviously they’ll decline to provide if they forged the document).  This runs too close to the honor system for mine and many experts comfort.

Meanwhile the data on the vaccination card is verifiable without violating HIPAA because presenting the card also provides patient consent to review their information.  The vaccine information is also stored in a national database which cannot be said about “proof of recovery” documentation (in the US) as far as I’m aware.

I don’t know how things work in the UK but over here “proof of recovery” on its own opens up too wide of a gap to be relied on when lives are at risk.

That fullfact article you linked says this very clearly at the top:

“WHAT WAS CLAIMED
Research from Israel suggests that the Pfizer vaccine is much less protective against Covid-19 than natural immunity from catching the disease.”

“OUR VERDICT
The research does say this. However, **it also says that infected people are even better protected if they get vaccinated as well.**”

I still reject the study but it seems like you also presented it in a misleading way to suggest vaccination was much less effective by a magnitude of 13x less when it seems the study may have been demonstrating the benefits of vaccination for previously infected.

This is exactly why unqualified amateurs (aka you and I) have no business trying to parse complicated medical studies ourselves.  You didn’t even come to the correct conclusion it seems because you desperately want natural immunity to be better/equal.

Regardless, the Kentucky study above seems to address this issue as well and comes to the same conclusion.

I’m not sure what you find important about the “exactly what we expect to be true” quote.  You could mean that an expert is validating the results or you could be using it to demonstrate the presence of bias in the interpretation or … something else?  If it’s important then explain why.

You seem to be using that quote to support that “13x as likely” claim from the study (or at least the study in general) but that’s not really the conclusion of the study according to your own link so did you just unintentionally argue against your position?

Finally, just to address why vaccination is more reliable and consistent than natural immunity.  The primary issue with natural immunity is that it’s wildly variable.

You could have natural immunity from an asymptomatic infection that fades in as little as 30-60 days or you could have a stronger natural immunity that lasts much longer from a severe infection that almost kills you.  Those two extremes of “natural immunity” are FAR from equivalent and I don’t think you can reasonably rely on “proof of recovery” as a valid benchmark for someone’s infectability as a result.

To get the “best” immunity from natural infection, something equivalent to a standard vaccination dose, you have to almost DIE and almost assuredly do permanent damage to your body.

Meanwhile the vaccine is a consistent dose that results in relatively uniform immunity in everyone who gets it which is a big part of why being vaccinated reduces your chances of dying from COVID to &lt;1% while natural immunity it’s only 3%.  1 or 2% might seem small but when death is the penalty you want to push that % as close to 0 as possible which the vaccine does better and more consistently than natural immunity alone.

I’ll never drop this.  I have a vested interest in combatting misinformation and vaccine hesitancy and it’s important to me.  I’ve been debating this for a while now and I just keep getting more and more fuel for the next debate which is why I appreciate our conversation because I’m learning how to counter the more pseudo-intellectuals in the anti-vax crowd which can often be difficult because they try to blind you with jargon and “facts” that are difficult to refute without being an expert which they’ll never admit it they aren’t.",,,,1633708799,{},hfv8z88,False,t3_q2ckda,False,True,t1_hft43j7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q2ckda/hospital_system_says_it_will_deny_transplants_to/hfv8z88/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,b4b7358f4c99639d67b63a4bc86dc0703207bf06,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1633708811.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Do they need to do a study that measures vaccine efficacy in individuals without prior infection or not?

You seem to be unwilling to accept the results of any of these studies if the vaccinated group contains individuals who had a previous infection and subsequently got the vaccine.

I’m telling you that you’ll never get a “clean” vaccine group because it’s impossible to tell if someone had an asymptomatic infection and never knew.

You need to just drop the Israel study and stop telling me about random comments from internet “researchers” because their input is next to meaningless.

This conversation started because you wouldn’t accept the very valid criticism of an internet commenter so I went and found an actual expert who said the exact same thing but you won’t accept that either.

If you want to find an expert who says this study is valid then go ahead but I won’t hold my breath.

At this point I’m not sure what you’re even looking for.  You don’t want to be vaccinated and don’t feel unvaccinated people should have any restrictions and are arguing that natural immunity should be given the same status as vaccination and I’ve provided numerous studies and viewpoints that argue against it because it’s not as reliable or as verifiable as vaccination is.

[],,pj7140,,,[],,,,text,t2_15ewuj28,False,False,[],"Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna launched their COVID-19 vaccine trials for kids as young as 6 months old in March ( 25 March at Duke University), and expect to share results as soon as September. This is the 2-injection protocol. For the FDA to authorize this under ""Emergency Use Authorization"", they are requiring a minimum of 2 months post injection ""safety"" data ..after each shot. Both companies will be providing more than 2 months of ""safety"" and ""efficacy"" data for the FDA to analyze and review, before any approval.  
By the time this age group (5-11 y/o) has completed the clinical trials, they will have about 6 months of ""safety"" data post first injection and about 4 months of data following the second injection. What is time-consuming, at the moment, is that they are doing parallel clinical trials for each age group with different dosages.  
Based on the clinical trial data thus far, the consensus is that the dosage for kids 5-11 y/o has been shown to be safe and effective at 1/2 of the adult dosage. Still given in 2 phases, but with half of the amount of vaccine per shot.  
For the younger kids ( infants to 4 y/o) they still have much data to analyze...as they are testing many more titrated levels of dosages in these younger kids.

  
• The important thing is, that for the 5-11 y/o, clinical trials have not shown any significant adverse reactions, and the dosage appears to be effective.  
Vaccines are usually studied and approved in order of age, with healthy adults first and babies last. After a COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for the oldest clinical trial group of kids, a company will move to the next youngest group.

  
Pfizer has said that once they have results from their clinical trial for 5-to-11-year-olds – expected in September or October – results for the 2-to-under-5 age group and 6-months-to-under-2 age group could quickly follow. They might then begin the same process for FDA emergency authorization for these ages. Depending on how the next few months go, it’s possible there could be a COVID-19 vaccine for children as young as 6 months old by midwinter.

It's only an inaccurate term if you believe women aren't people. People like you get up in arms about this wording way more than I see any trans people directly complaining about ""pregnant women"" being used. What I see complained about more is when stuff happens like insurance refuses to pay the hospital bills for pregnant trans men because men can't get pregnant so it must be fraud, but they just hadn't had a hysterectomy yet so could still get pregnant, or when doctors and others call a specific trans man or non-binary person a woman due to pregnancy to try to hurt them. I don't care so much about language in general, but this attitude that pregnant trans and non-binary people should get called women and have an already difficult process made more difficult for them is harmful.

In 2018, the FBI collected assault data from 11,788 law enforcement agencies that employed 546,247 officers. These officers provided service to more than 250.6 million people, or 76.6 percent of the nation’s population. (See Table 80.)  
  
Law enforcement agencies reported that 58,866 officers were assaulted while performing their duties in 2018. (See Table 80.)  
  
The rate of officer assaults in 2018 was 10.8 per 100 sworn officers. (See Table 80.)  
  
Of the 58,866 officers who were assaulted, 18,005 (30.6 percent) sustained injuries. (Based on Table 80.)

It's completely logical to think a respiratory disease that causes extreme damage to the lungs would be a lot less deadly if it was absorbed by the GI tract where there's far fewer ACE-2 receptors, so viral production would increase slowly giving the immune system a better chance to stop it without going haywire from a high viral load.

[],,tractiontiresadvised,,,[],,,,text,t2_2md6zqzx,False,False,[],"The videos which I mentioned in my prior comment are good sources. They're one-hour lectures from a virology course which Vincent Racaniello teaches for medical students at Columbia University. They're from last spring. I watched lectures #1-5 and 11-25 in the series; the nuts and bolts of viral RNA and DNA processing went over my head but the rest were informative.

The [Vaccines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55R09egthg) lecture does discuss in particular the issue of whether vaccines prevent infection or prevent disease. If you want something text-based, he has a [blog post](https://www.virology.ws/2021/03/11/how-vaccines-work/) from last March which touches on the topic.

(Side note: I should mention that a lot of the ""vaccines don't prevent infections"" discussions are working on an assumption that if a vaccine can't prevent something 100%, then it's not worth getting one. As you'll see from what Dr. Racaniello has to say, that's not true.)

If you find the vaccines lecture to be interesting, you might also want to check out the [Acute Infections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFdvPsrjJ-0) lecture. It goes over what normally happens in an acute (i.e. not chronic) infection like the flu or measles, and has a section specifically about COVID-19 at [1:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFdvPsrjJ-0&amp;t=3868s).

If your BF has questions that these don't really answer, the American Society for Virology (which is a professional society for scientists who study viruses) has been having a set of [""vaccine education town halls""](https://asv.org/education/). They're online events where a couple of virologists will answer questions from the general public about vaccines and COVID.

[],,nuflybindo,,,[],,,,text,t2_8dp6z86u,False,False,,"That 0.5% of the 4.1 million vaccinated indivduals got infected  
does not mean the breakthrough rate for vaccinated indiviauls is 0.5% (which would mean the vaccine efficacy is 99.5%). This would only be true if  
all 4.1 million individuals had been exposed to the virus. 

(To clarify, vaccine efficacy= 1 - the breakthrough rate %, so by calculating one you also get the other.)

As the UK governments report on vaccine efficacy states ""Vaccine effectiveness is estimated by comparing rates of disease in vaccinated  
individuals to rates in unvaccinated individuals"" - aka using a control group. [https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/990089/Vaccine\_surveillance\_report\_-\_week\_20.pdf#page=4](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/990089/Vaccine_surveillance_report_-_week_20.pdf#page=4)

Not even the vaccine manafactureres have claimed that the vaccine efficacy is 99.5%. From the UK government report ""Estimates for 2 doses are currently only  
available for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and indicate effectiveness against infection of  
70 to 90% "" and for sympotmatic disease ""Data on 2 doses is only currently available for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and indicates effectiveness of around 85 to 90%""

Regardless, the 0.5% figure is incomparable to the 0.7% figure for many reasons but the keys one are:  
\-The 0.7% figure was in people who had severe infection, whereas the 0.5% is in the whole population. We know that people who ended up with  
severe infection of covid will have higher a prevelance of comorbidites that will increase their chance of reinfection when compared to the average population  
\-They are from different cities over different time periods, so their exposure to the virus is going to be signficantly different for multiple reasons including different case rates, population density, mask use etc

These figures are therefore not evidence that vaccination alone provides better protection that previous infection alone, and to try and present it as such is disingenuous.  


Previously infected indivuals who were asymtomatic being recorded as ""vaccinated only"" would only skew the results in favour of vaccination offering more protection, and I'm sure there would be ways to account for the small statiscal impact it may have on the results regardless. Of the 420+ comments on the original comparative study from Israel, I have not seen one person flag this as a concern.

""It’s confusing because I thought we were talking about the benefits of vaccination for those with previous immunity but then you want to know the breakthrough rate for someone who is vaccinated and maybe never had COVID. I don’t see the relevance in that information in this context""

There are policies (such as the one in the article of this post which this discussion was orignally about) being made that assume that individuals who have been previously infected are at greater risk of catching, spreading or dying of covid than those who have only been vaccinated and not infected. Vaccine passports for example (that don't exempt for prior infection, many do), they allow entry to a nighthtclub to someone who has only been vaccinated, but do not allow entry to someone who has been previously infected. For this to be based in logic, there needs to be evidence that the vaccinated only indivudal has a lower chance of carrying covid, than the previously infected indivudal. This is why this information is important.  
I find it incredibly hard to believe that more comaprative studies that would provide this evidence have not already been completed, and I am not convinced   
that it is now too late to do so.",,,,1633644799,{},hfs7x5l,False,t3_q2ckda,False,True,t1_hfry8j7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q2ckda/hospital_system_says_it_will_deny_transplants_to/hfs7x5l/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,66c3ea987c4038b61fd77e1ded835e7fa971f423,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1633644813.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,True

Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic generated by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The primary infection site is mucosal surfaces, mainly the lungs and the intestine, where epithelial cells can be infected. COVID-19 has spread throughout the world, causing millions of deaths and hundreds of millions of confirmed infections. Despite the global spread of SARS-CoV-2, there are extreme differences between countries in mortality rates and confirmed infections.

Methods: Pearson correlations and a t-test were performed on data from 137 countries in order to test the correlation between number of deaths from diarrheal diseases (pre-COVID-19 pandemic data) as a marker for countries’ sanitation level, and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths per million.

Results: It was found that countries’ prevalence of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths per million are statistically correlated with their sanitation level.

Conclusions: The hypothesis proposed in this article is that the low mortality rates from COVID-19 in countries where the level of sanitation is low are due to fecal-oral infection of the population by SARS-CoV-2, rather than infection of the respiratory system. This hypothesis is supported by the protective effect of the low sanitation level presented in this work and the fact that lung infection by SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe pathology, while infection in the intestine generally causes minor or no symptoms.",,,,1633644574,{},hfs7foy,True,t3_q3jxev,False,False,t3_q3jxev,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q3jxev/does_fecaloral_transmission_of_sarscov2_due_to/hfs7foy/,1633773018.0,13,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I would think the fact that nobody in my family has side effects to flu vaxes would make it less likely that I would. I'm still wondering what possible factors made it so horrific for me.

For instance, is it possible/likely that I already had strong antibodies against that strain of flu? I swear that between 2007-2009 I had literally every flu imaginable, and then I had a flu in 2016.

It'll take a bit longer than that. Even if the FDA panel votes unanimously for the EUA, the CDC still has to approve the EUA before it's official. After that, the procedure will vary by state, but in most of the USA, the state health department will have to give their own authorization. This will take some time in states that let their COVID state of emergency expire. 

Then Pfizer just said today they want to ship new vaccine vials with a lower concentration serum for the pediatric dose. So while you could use a smaller dose of the adult serum in a pinch, best practices will be to wait until those pediatric vials are distributed. Right now, the public has zero information about the plan for that.

&gt; SARS-CoV-2 is one of many potential viral threats to humans. There are just over 250 known zoonotic viruses—viruses that have previously spilled over from animals to humans and caused disease in people (4). https://www.pnas.org/content/118/15/e2002324118 Ranking the risk of animal-to-human spillover for newly discovered viruses

At any given moment there exist thousands of zoonotic viruses, that have pandemic potential. Even for a single virus type thousands of spillover events happen every year:

&gt; Most human infectious diseases are initially transmitted from animals. [...] For example, Olival and colleagues' analysis would not distinguish between Lassa virus (which spills over tens of thousands of times annually6) and Lujo virus (which has only ever spilt over once, to our knowledge6) https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23088/ Predictions of virus spillover across species

&gt; Over one billion cases of human zoonotic disease are estimated to occur annually and novel emerging zoonoses have resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses [...] In general, wild animals were suggested as the source of zoonotic transmission for 91% (86/95) of zoonotic viruses compared to 34% (32/95) of viruses transmitted from domestic animals and 25% (24/95) with transmission described from both wild and domestic animals (see Supplementary Table). Wild animals, which include a taxonomically diverse range of thousands of species, were significantly more likely to be a source for animal-to-human spillover of viruses than domesticated species (exact P = 0.001). Wild rodents were implicated as a source of spillover for 58% (55/95) of zoonotic viruses, particularly for zoonotic arenaviruses (n = 8/8, exact P = 0.019) and zoonotic bunyaviruses (n = 20/24, exact P = 0.004). Primates were implicated as a source of zoonotic retroviruses (exact P = 0.017), while bats were more implicated for zoonotic paramyxoviruses (exact P = 0.011) and most zoonotic rhabdoviruses (6/8, exact P = 0.002). https://www.nature.com/articles/srep14830 Spillover and pandemic properties of zoonotic viruses with high host plasticity",,,,1633696574,{},hfuiaji,False,t3_q3sgpj,False,False,t1_hfucjrf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q3sgpj/daily_discussion_thread_october_08_2021/hfuiaji/,1633817238.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes, human behavior will decide when the pandemic ends, not because people come together and take on strict mediations to lower cases, but because most people will reach a point of fatigue and acceptance and say that they're done. 

For those that are vaccinated, and in highly vaccinated areas, the pandemic isn't really touching them very much anymore. Life is largely back to normal, and they and their families are largely safe and they're ready to move on. 

For the unvaccinated, they're so stubborn in their ideology that it doesn't really matter what else happens. Cases and deaths that are touching their lives aren't really moving the needle for them, and they aren't going to take on new mitigations at this point. They're pretty done. 

The societal end to the pandemic will come long before the epidemiological end, and some might say it's already here. Frankly, the CDC is partially to blame for that for manipulating, editorializing, and bungling messaging throughout this pandemic. Even people who actually believe science, and that the CDC has been working in good faith are shaking their heads at the messaging that's been coming from that agency. It's been a big miss from them this entire pandemic.

Worldwide though 2021 has been much worse than 2020 with 4.8m deaths now compared to 1.9m by the end of 2020. Both figures not surprising. One vaccines are not equally distributed for example Canada and the EU had numerous supply issues at the start so vaccines was going painfully slow for them. India had a shortage of vaccines and through a horrendous wave of Delta. 

Even today we still have unequal vaccine distribution with many poorer countries still short on vaccines. According to bloombergs vaccine tracker enough vaccines have been given out to fully vaccinate 41.9% of the population. We need much more of the world vaccinated to really put a dent in covid. Also are we not forgetting the christmas surge in both the US and worldwide deaths sky rocketed soon after christmas. And unfortunately the vaccines never came in time to stop that christmas surge. And in the US especially takeup has not been all that great i mean at one point we only had just over 50% adults vaccinated in the US and we thus saw a surge in low vaccination states for covid deaths.

Yes and you were wrong, vaccines were already in clinical trials, a decision was made by US and UK leadership to withhold the sharing of the patents with other countries to speed up global production. As it turned out, despite the selfish behavior by both US and UK leadership, a new variant came along and caused even more deaths.

there is something called a ""window period"" which is in between the point of exposure/infection and the point where your immune system starts attempting to fight it off, which creates antibodies, and these antibodies are what they test for. in HIV this window period is between 3 and 6 months.

This is why there are so many questions, very specific questions that are asked when you donate blood- for example have you used needles, gotten a tattoo or piercing, been to prison, in the last year...a bunch of stuff like that.

&amp;#x200B;

these answers dictate weather you even get to donate blood that day, because if you have done anything in the last 6 months that might put you in the ""window period"", they wont take your blood at all.

&amp;#x200B;

but i can assure you that they absolutely test for everything, every single time.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: i worked for a blood bank, and i also worked for a HIV clinic

&amp;#x200B;

in fact, if they find something in your blood, they mail you a letter telling you that they found something, but they wont tell you what it is and that you need to call your doctor, because people used to donate blood instead of going to the doctor.",,,,1633719084,{},hfvxjzg,False,t3_q3wg5d,False,True,t1_hfvt4ks,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q3wg5d/more_people_are_getting_covid19_vaccine_boosters/hfvxjzg/,1633843773.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is an example because you are starting with 'information' that you already have and making further reasoning off it. The further reasoning is sound, if something is harmful you should probably tell people to not use it. However unfortunately the 'knowledge' you started with is not sound, and therefore everything that is built upon that knowledge is not sound.

The vaccine hasn't been out for 36 months, but we have given vaccines to billions of people worldwide and we have a pretty good history with vaccines for other diseases to understand how this one will act. You think we're all suddenly going to grow a third arm after 36 months? We do know that there are long-term issues for many who have been infected with COVID. I'd love to see your data that shows watching ""Squid Game"" won't make you kill yourself exactly 1 year after you've watched the final episode. I'll wait. (See how ridiculous that sounds?)

The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act was invoked for COVID vaccines due to the need for an expedited timeline. Companies like Pfizer and Moderna weren't going to release a product they couldn't study for years without some protections in place. That said, they still had plenty of research to back up the safety of the vaccine and they have hundreds of millions of people to point to now who have receive the vaccine safely.

COVID Vaccines are a huge market because it affects everyone on the planet. The reason vaccines are funded with public money is because everyone needs one to stay alive. There are all kinds of things funded by the government to keep us safe. This vaccine is just one example.

The vaccine wasn't CREATED with public money, it was PURCHASED with public money. Operation warp speed basically told these companies ""make something you can prove works and we'll guarantee you a big purchase."" We needed to increase their timeline, so we basically gave them the means to do so without needing to waste time on getting the money together. You could write the best book ever written and no one's going to read it unless you get an editor, publisher, distributor, etc. all lined up. We basically said, here's the money to do all of that, now write that book.

YOU are the one being sold a lie. You know what a 97% survival rate means? It means 3% of the people who get it fucking die!

Firstly, it's not ""if the vaccinated group contains individuals who had a previous infection and subsequently got the vaccine."" 

It is ""if the vaccinated group contains individuals who ALL had a previous infection and subsequently got the vaccine""

Secondly, it's not that I don't accept the results. It's just that their results do not pertain to whether vaccination ALONE provides better protection than previous infection ALONE. I address the possibility of previous undetected asymptomatic infection in the ""vaccination alone"" group, in the next part of my comment.

""If you want to find an expert who says this study is valid then go ahead but I won’t hold my breath.""

When in my recent comments have I said that I think the Israel study is valid? I would really like to know. I have no idea why you are trying to claim this is a point I'm trying to make. My point is that it would be possible to recreate a similar study, with adjustments made that address the flaws that have been pointed out. You seem to want me to believe that such a study is not possible because of your personal belief that possible undetected asymptomatic infection in the ""vaccinated only"" group would render the results invalid:

""I’m telling you that you’ll never get a “clean” vaccine group because it’s impossible to tell if someone had an asymptomatic infection and never knew.""

How do you know for certain that this effect would be significant enough to render the results of a comparative study invalid? Please understand the vast difference between:
-vaccinated and deemed to be uninfected, but possibly had an undetected asymptomatic infection
-vaccinated and infected as shown by a positive PCR result/ any other lab test

""I’ve provided numerous studies and viewpoints that argue against it because it’s not as reliable or as verifiable as vaccination is.""

You have not provided any studies that show that the protection afforded by vaccination alone is more reliable than previous infection alone. The only way this can be proven is in a comparative study. If you think that you have, then that is your error.

""You’re arguing that the honor system and self diagnosis are sufficient and experts disagree""

Again, at no point have I said this. Please inform me of when I have. I think previous infection should have to be evidenced by either a positive PCR tests and/or antibody tests. 

""because it’s not as verifiable as vaccination is.""

A positive PCR test or antibody test is just as verifiable as vaccination. In the UK all this information is stored in the same database. We have a covid pass that you need to travel internationally or go to some events, which can be obtained following a positive PCR test. The information from the PCR test is stored in the same way as information on vaccination status, and the same could be done for antibody results.",,,,1633660480,{},hft43j7,False,t3_q2ckda,False,True,t1_hfsub2a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q2ckda/hospital_system_says_it_will_deny_transplants_to/hft43j7/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,f4dbd37dda061620672c81ed7b1723b46ab6daf2,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1633660497.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,True

Background: Post-vaccination myopericarditis is reported after immunization with COVID-19 mRNA-vaccines. The effect of accidental intravenous injection of this vaccine on the heart is unknown.  
  
Methods: We compared the clinical manifestations, histopathological changes, tissue mRNA expression and serum levels of cytokine/chemokine in Balb/c mice at different time points after intravenous(IV) or intramuscular(IM) vaccine injection with normal saline(NS) control.  
  
Results: Though significant weight loss and higher serum cytokine/chemokine levels were found in IM group at 1 to 2 days post-injection(dpi), only IV group developed histopathological changes of myopericarditis as evidenced by cardiomyocyte degeneration, apoptosis and necrosis with adjacent inflammatory cell infiltration and calcific deposits on visceral pericardium, while evidence of coronary artery or other cardiac pathologies was absent. SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen expression by immunostaining was occasionally found in infiltrating immune cells of the heart or injection site, in cardiomyocytes and intracardiac vascular endothelial cells, but not skeletal myocytes. The histological changes of myopericarditis after the first IV-priming dose persisted for 2 weeks and were markedly aggravated by a second IM- or IV-booster dose. Cardiac tissue mRNA expression of IL-1β, IFN-β, IL-6 and TNF-α increased significantly from 1dpi to 2dpi in IV but not IM group, compatible with presence of myopericarditis in IV group. Ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes was consistently found in IV group. All other organs appeared normal.  
  
Conclusions: This study provided in-vivo evidence that inadvertent intravenous injection of COVID-19 mRNA-vaccines may induce myopericarditis. Brief withdrawal of syringe plunger to exclude blood aspiration may be one possible way to reduce such risk.

&gt;The purveyors of vaccine misinformation represent a small but vocal minority of the nation’s 70,000 chiropractors, many of whom advocate for vaccines. In some places, chiropractors have helped organize vaccine clinics or been authorized to give COVID-19 shots.

Our professional organizations have been very publicly vocal about following CDC guidelines and recommendations from the beginning. Here are some of the statements they put out:

From the World Federation of Chiropractic:

&gt;As a worldwide community, the WFC understands that there are many questions being asked of chiropractors and that the situation varies from country to country. In order to support the global efforts of our fellow health professionals it is of critical importance that chiropractors communicate information to their patients and communities that is scientifically accurate and comes from authoritative sources.

&gt;Advice communicated to patients by chiropractors and their staff should be based on advice from WHO and official national public health agencies in their country. 

&gt;There is no credible scientific evidence that chiropractic spinal adjustment/manipulation confers or boosts immunity. Chiropractors should refrain from any communication that suggests spinal adjustment/manipulation may protect patients from contracting COVID-19 or will enhance their recovery. Doing otherwise is potentially dangerous to public health.

https://www.wfc.org/website/images/wfc/Latest_News_and_Features/Coronavirus_statement_2020_03_17.pdf

The American Chiropractic Association released a similar statement:

&gt;Practices that attend to urgent cases must employ strict hygienic practices at every point of patient contact and keep up to date with prevention recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We urge everyone to closely monitor state and local health authorities and to comply with any relevant guidance or mandates...

&gt;We are committed to responding to misinformation that may cause confusion. For example, some claims are being made that spinal adjustments can boost immunity and decrease the risk of contracting COVID-19. While spinal adjustments are effective for a number of conditions, there is no quality evidence to support that they can improve immunity to COVID-19.

https://www.acatoday.org/News-Publications/Newsroom/Coronavirus-COVID-19/Safe-Responsible-Response

The group that represents the anti-vaxxers and ""straight"" chiropractors is called the ICA. They were spouting some BS, so a group of 150 of the top chiropractic researchers wrote and co-signed a statement calling them out. It was published in a chiropractic journal on May 4th 2020. From the abstract:

&gt;Background: In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the International Chiropractors Association (ICA) posted reports claiming that chiropractic care can impact the immune system. These claims clash with recommendations from the World Health Organization and World Federation of Chiropractic. We discuss the scientific validity of the claims made in these ICA reports.

&gt;Conclusion: In their reports, the ICA provided no valid clinical scientific evidence that chiropractic care can impact the immune system. We call on regulatory authorities and professional leaders to take robust political and regulatory action against those claiming that chiropractic adjustments have a clinical impact on the immune system.

https://chiromt.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12998-020-00312-x

So many more chiropractic researchers wanted to co-sign the above paper that they resubmitted it in July 2020 with even more signatures. You can read about it here: https://chiromt.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12998-020-00334-5

I know it is a pre-print, but it is discussing the Sars-COV-2 and vaccine induced myocarditis.

I realize you are likely trying to calm fears about vaccine hesitation, but myocarditis is not something to take lightly. It absolutely kills (sometimes years later). It takes people we would consider athletic and in ""good health"" so it is totally worth knowing about and being tested for. There are treatments in research for this that focus on regeneration, so understanding it is an issue and getting treatment for it may save lives.

To my point, i know the percentage of deaths that are gen-x have more than doubled. (last summer: \~650 of 13000 was 5%. More recently, \~170 of 1300 is 13%. I made a post last week with links and real numbers). So the number of dead is much lower but the percentage is much higher. I can think of 3 major reasons why this may be the case:

1) The most frail old people are already gone. Not likely, since a major portion of old people simply didn't contract it. Since we're no longer in shutdowns, I don't think this is the most likely scenario.

2) The delta variant is more dangerous to gen-x. This may be true, but it doesn't explain why the percentage is much higher. i.e. if its better at killing 50 year olds, I would think it would be better at killing 70 year olds, too. The percentage wouldn't stay the same, but I don't think it would more than double.

3) Vaccination adoption among old people are reducing their deaths, and people resisting vaccination are more prevalent among the under 60 crowd than the boomers.

No, just flat out wrong.

Last I've heard on this, it seems Covid-19 is mostly transmitted directly from one person's respiratory system to another person's. This means essentially breathing the same air as someone who has it. It travels even better if people are yelling/talking/singing, particularly if that's in an enclosed space. 

I have no idea who you heard said it's not ""airborne like the flu."" All research I've read (as well as anecdotal patterns I personally know of) suggests that it is even *more* airborne than influenza viral particles are. Possibly due to covid particles being smaller or lighter in weight, and surviving better when they are directly breathed in.

I understand you're having trouble believing anyone -- new research is taking place in real-time. I tend to look at research by epidemiologists versus listening to media headlines, which helps keep me sane. You might enjoy a podcast called This Podcast Will Kill You.

Yep.

Agreed, however their outside advisory committee has WHO members on it.  So obviously there is influence.

I don't think they are dead wrong.  I think at face value it makes complete sense that a first or second shot for a naïve host in the developing world would do more overall good than a third shot in the US.  However I've seen nothing that suggests that this is how it would actually play out.  There is simply too much that goes into logistics, etc. which makes this a theory vs. practice.  The administration already committed a billion shots donated by mid next year.  They already said they can undoubtedly both boost and meet their obligations.  Other superpowers need to step up their game too.  It is my personal opinion but this is more of a morality problem than anything else.  +/- 100 million boosters (for those that would want them) can be produced in a few weeks.  We were producing well over 4 million per day in the spring, I can only imagine capacity is way up by now.  For me this screams equity at all cost.
