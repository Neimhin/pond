Sweden now plans to donate one million doses of Astra Zeneca's corona vaccine to Covax, the international collaboration to help with the urgent need for vaccines worldwide. This news was announced by Minister for Development Aid Per Olsson Fridh (MP) in SVT's Morgonstudion on Monday.
- We need to do everything we can to meet this pandemic, he says.

Due to the very serious situation in India, vaccine deliveries to the global Covax vaccine collaboration have been delayed.

That is why Sweden is now donating one million doses to the international initiative that will deliver vaccines against covid-19 to low-income countries free of charge.

- We see how the pandemic is raging around the world. People are dying, poverty is spreading and children are still not back in school. We need to do everything we can to meet this pandemic, and fight it all over the world, says Minister for Development Aid Per Olsson Fridh in Morgonstudion.

He believes that it is not time to ""sit and hold doses"". And the Minister for Development Aid has previously said that he wants Sweden to donate vaccines as soon as Swedish risk groups have been vaccinated.

- Sweden is already a leading financier in the Covax collaboration, but what we do now is that we also go in with a million doses to ensure that more people in the world can get vaccines quickly.

Does not affect Sweden's vaccination rate
Just like the money donated so far for the collaboration, the vaccine donation is financed from the development assistance budget. Per Olsson Fridh also says that there may be more donations later.

To which countries the doses will be sent is currently unclear. There are 92 aid-financed countries that receive vaccines through Covax, and it is the World Health Organization, WHO, and Covax that I decide in detail which countries will receive them.

The fact that Sweden now donates Astra vaccines does not affect the national vaccination work, according to Sweden's vaccine coordinator Richard Bergström.

- We have received Astra Zeneca until they are over 65 now, most recently, and in the coming weeks we will take the necessary doses to get it done, and have a dose of two for those who need it, says Bergström in Morgonstudion.

- And this is a million, we actually have four or five more, of Astra Zenecas vaccines that we can share later.",,,1620034599,{},gwrhmy1,True,t3_n3rx7h,False,False,t3_n3rx7h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n3rx7h/sweden_donates_1_million_oxfordaz_doses_to_covax/gwrhmy1/,1620064157,24,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

3. Healthcare provider: you retrieve information from each healthcare provider in order to record it on the passport. So, there is at least a one-way link which will be recorded for auditing purposes.

So, even though this information is not presented in the passport, it is most likely needed to create the passport and keep it up-to-date. I am looking at the data processing as a whole and all the actors involved.

After the \[joyful news of the\] first 50 million doses of vaccine given by the Minister of Health Fahrettin Koca the previous day, the production of Sputnik V, developed by the Russian Gamelia Institute, will now be made in Turkey.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The factory of CinneGen, which is shown as the largest biotechnological pharmaceutical company in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), was established in Çerkezköy Organized Industrial Zone with an investment of 30 million Euros 4 years ago in Turkey, in fact, it was opened in 2019 to produce monoclonal antibodies against cancer.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In the first months of 2020, CinnaGen İlaç co-founder and CEO Ferhat Farsi said that they have also managed to obtain the internationally recognized GMP (Good Manifacturing Practice) certificate from the Ministry of Health that it can produce at world standards, and said that they shared a similar fate with Uğur Şahin.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""WE LIVED THE SAME FATE WITH UĞUR ŞAHİN""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Farsi said:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\* In fact, we are a 30-year-old biotech company. We started our activities in Turkey in 2016 and this factory was opened in June 2019. We essentially made all our preparations for the production of the first monoclonal antibodies in Turkey. We have a (R&amp;D) team of 50 people.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\* They received serious training on biotechnological products for 2 years both domestically and abroad. In fact, I compare the process we came to very much with what my teacher Uğur Şahin went through. Because our teacher Uğur would also use the mRNA platform for cancer treatment.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\* But after the covid pandemic, he had to channel this platform to the covid vaccine. We prepared ourselves especially for the production of monoclonal antibodies in cancer treatment.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\* Monoclinal antibodies in biotechnology are actually more complex molecules compared to vaccines. In other words, while we were preparing for higher technology and production, the vaccine entered our agenda with the pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""NOT FILLING, WE WILL PRODUCE ZERO VACCINE \[PRODUCE VACCINE FROM SCRATCH\]""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Farsi underlined that vaccine production will be made from scratch, not ""vaccine filling"", in the facility whose GMP certification has been completed, and said, ""It is worth mentioning that we will carry out the whole production process of the vaccine in Turkey from A to Z in these facilities. I am really proud of this on behalf of my company. Because we will make an extremely complex production in Turkey using bioreactors from A to Z, including the master cell line. In other words, this is not a vaccine filling activity, I want to specifically mention. We are talking about a vector-based adenovirus vaccine. It is one of the first 3 vaccines in the world that has been prepared and developed with extremely high technology and has an extremely high reliability and efficiency, with an efficiency of more than 90 percent. We are proud to produce this vaccine in Turkey, which received the first license in the world in Covid 19, ”he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""WE HAVE THE VACCINE PRODUCTION CERTIFICATE IN WORLD STANDARDS""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Stating that, towards the end of 2020, the GMP certification application they made to the Ministry of Health during the beginning of the pandemic was finalized and they managed to obtain the internationally valid document, which means to produce at world standards, Farsi said, “This is a document required for the production of biotech products. After that, after adapting ourselves to vaccine production, we applied to the Ministry of Health again and after various inspections, this time additional certification was made for vaccine production. Later, we applied again specifically for the product specific, that is, the Sputnik vaccine. In him, a GMP certification was added specifically for the product, that is, for the product, ”he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""YOU MUST HAVE THE SAME TECHNOLOGY WITH THE VACCINE DEVELOPERS""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Pointing out that the vaccine was developed in Russia by the state-sponsored Gamelya Institute, Ferhat Farsi continued his words as follows:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\* 130 years of serious institute. It is a serious institution that has its signature in very innovative vaccines. It was very important to be able to speak the same language as the technology provider (they) and the company that bought the technology (CinnaGen). It was very important to have the same technology. Russian officials also came here last March.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\* Seeing the facility, seeing the qualification of our staff, they were sure of everything and wanted to start the processes for production as soon as possible. After that, things got faster. We carried out the technology transfer of the vaccine.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\* In this technology transfer, you receive the entire production process of the vaccine and all documentation regarding quality control. More importantly, we acquired the master cell line, which we can call the ""heart of the vaccine"" in vaccine production. We also received the virus seeds needed to produce the adenovirus vaccine.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;ONE OF THE WORLD'S SAFE VACCINE TECHNOLOGIES  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Stating that adenovirus vaccines are a well-known technology, Farsi emphasized that this vaccine technology has been used since 1953 and that Sputnik V was also created with this method. Farsi provided the following information:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\* Use of these extremely safe adenoviruses (in vaccines). Viruses (vector) that do not cause any disease in humans, an important and immune response of the coronavirus occurs.

What I can gather is that Fauci in the article stated that, ""“People were getting confused and thinking you’re never going to get the infections down until you reach this mystical level of herd immunity, whatever that number is,” he said.

“That’s why we stopped using herd immunity in the classic sense,” he added. “I’m saying: Forget that for a second. You vaccinate enough people, the infections are going to go down.”

So we shouldn't focus on a magic uncertain number, but try to get as many people vaccinated anyways.

This virus was never going to go away once it broke out the gate and the best we can do is eventually either vaccinate or get infected.

They're saying a theoretical 30% of people with vaccine hesitancy will stop us from reaching a brand new increased goal of 80% (up from their previous 50-60%) herd immunity. But there's no solid data on if these numbers are absolute, as we haven't opened to children and if the vaccines get FDA approval and not just EUA, then more workplaces, and schools can mandate the vaccine. And even if they don't, much like the 1918 flu it'll either spread through the community or vaccination and lose its Novel Virus status. 



“We will not achieve herd immunity as a country or a state or even as a city until we have enough immunity in the population as a whole,” said Lauren Ancel Meyers, the director of the Covid-19 Modeling Consortium at the University of Texas at Austin.""

All I can say is, no shit. They are declaring failure that even if we reach the goal nationally we failed because some bubble pocket in the middle of nowhere can't reach a high percent like say a city or California.

""If the herd immunity threshold is not attainable, what matters most is the rate of hospitalizations and deaths after pandemic restrictions are relaxed, experts believe[....]""What we want to do at the very least is get to a point where we have just really sporadic little flare-ups,” said Carl Bergstrom, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. “That would be a very sensible target in this country where we have an excellent vaccine and the ability to deliver it.” 

This has always been the goal, eradication is way too lofty and near impossible now. We might not reach herd immunity through vaccination, but it will go through communities anyway. In summary, I think hope is not lost and we should encourage and drive the vaccine effort to reach out to everyone in their community in a way that best fits them.",,,1620052113,{},gwsbr8y,False,t3_n3su92,False,True,t3_n3su92,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n3su92/reaching_herd_immunity_is_unlikely_in_the_us/gwsbr8y/,1620081935,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

“We went to Oxford and said, Hey, you’re doing brilliant work,” Bill Gates told reporters on June 3, a transcript shows. “But … you really need to team up.” The comments were first reported by Bloomberg.

AstraZeneca, one of the U.K.’s two major pharma companies, may have demanded an exclusive license in return for doing a deal, said Ken Shadlen, a professor at the London School of Economics and an authority on pharma patents—a theory supported by comments from CEO Soriot.

“I think IP [intellectual property, or exclusive patents] is a fundamental part of our industry and if you don’t protect IP, then essentially there is no incentive for anybody to innovate,” Soriot told the newspaper The Telegraph in May.

Some see the Gates Foundation, a heavy funder of Gavi, CEPI and many other vaccine projects, as supporting traditional patent rights for pharma companies.

Indian double-mutant COVID strain found in neighbouring Nepal as cases explode

Coronavirus cases in Nepal have exploded as the virulent Indian strain of the virus crosses the two neighbouring countries' open border. 

Key points:

Nepal reported a record 7,137 new COVID-19 cases on Sunday
Nearly 40 per cent of people tested returned a positive result
Nepal has an 1,800-kilometre open border with India
The seven-day average of new daily cases in Nepal rose to 4,544 on May 1 — up from just 136 at the start of April.

The surge in infections last week prompted the government to impose new lockdowns in major cities and towns, restricting the movement of people and vehicles and shuttering markets, offices and schools.

Tens of thousands of people rushed out of Kathmandu to avoid the 15-day shutdown that began on Thursday.

""Infections have surged beyond the capacity of the health system,"" Nepal's health ministry said on Friday as it warned that hospital beds were running out amid a spike in infections.

On Sunday, the Himalayan nation recorded 7,137 new cases, a record high.

Nearly 40 per cent of people tested returned a positive result, data from the ministry showed.

The government has enforced lockdowns or partial lockdowns in almost half of Nepal's 77 districts.

Hospital beds were already scarce and medical resources stretched as the country entered the new wave trying to recover from an economic hit from a nearly four-month lockdown last year.

India reported 3,689 COVID-19 deaths on Sunday — the highest single-day rise yet in the pandemic, to take the overall toll to more than 215,000.

Just under 400,000 infections were added, bringing the total number of cases past 19.5 million.

The latest figures in India came as medical equipment — including oxygen-generation plants — was flown into the capital New Delhi from France and Germany as part of a huge international effort.

Nepal's latest concern has been the 1,800-kilometre open border the Himalayan nation shares with India.

Tens of thousands of Nepalese migrant workers have been returning to Nepal across this border as India's health system breaks down.

The government has ordered tests and quarantines for those arriving, but in practice many people slip through undetected and travel to their villages.

""We have detected the UK variant and the double mutant variant detected in India,"" Krishna Prasad Paudel, the director of Nepal's Epidemiology and Disease Control Department Paudel told Reuters last week, adding that experts were checking for other variants too.

Nepal's former king, Gyanendra, and his wife, who tested positive for the virus after returning from India where they attended a religious festival, were undergoing treatment at a private facility in Kathmandu.

""The situation is really frightening,"" said Prakash Thapa, a doctor at Bheri hospital in Nepalgunj, a city in the south-west plains bordering India.

He said the hospital was inundated with coronavirus patients requiring intensive care and ventilators.

""This time even children and young people are brought in critical condition and patients are even sleeping on the floor and corridors,"" he said.

Nepal's ruling Communist Party has been embroiled in a power struggle for months, and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has been criticised for his response to the crisis.

Nepal began a vaccination campaign in January with 1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine donated by India, but this was suspended because of India's refusal to allow exports as its domestic situation worsened.

Nepal has also paid for an additional 1 million doses from India, but has been waiting for the delivery since March.

This shipment is needed for elderly people scheduled for a second dose in May.

The campaign was resumed with 800,000 vaccine doses donated by China, and now Nepal is negotiating with Russian authorities for supplies of Russian vaccines.",,,1620051028,{},gws9ehe,False,t3_n3w029,False,False,t3_n3w029,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n3w029/indian_doublemutant_covid_strain_found_in/gws9ehe/,1620080575,13,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;**He stressed that the vaccines' EUA status doesn't mean they're less safe**. As a member of the FDA vaccine advisory committee, Offit said the vaccines are reviewed with the **same level of scrutiny as they would to get full approval**.


&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, is director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia and a member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.

The more community spread there is over a period of years, the greater the likelihood of another pandemic as people who didn’t keep up on their vaccines become exposed again. 

2.  Children still cannot be vaccinated and there is a portion of the population for whom the vaccines are not effective. Herd immunity is necessary to protect the most vulnerable among us and enabling unmitigated spread among the unvaccinated robs the vulnerable of the ability to safely exist in the world.

I mean, yes the mRNA vaccines were being manufactured 6 months ago. But not long before that. The point is, however, you’re able to see this, but not able to see that other places which aren’t manufacturing it currently, could also be manufacturing it in the future. 

Manufacturers were asking in the fall to begin the process of setting up the facilities. Pfizer and moderna both rejected outright. So those places could’ve been manufacturing vaccines now, and aiding in the push to get poorer countries vaccinated before 2024. That didn’t happen obviously. Now, they could start this process now, because again we’re talking about 2024 before some countries are vaccinated, and actually have vaccines being produced in the coming months.....

Why do you, random reddexoert,  insist that the vaccines could only be manufactured where they are currently, when numerous experts are exclaiming they could now be manufacturing vaccines had the assistance program been utilized in the fall?

 Vaccinated but won't go out? The rise of Covid anxiety syndrome  
 [*By*Rosa Silverman](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/rosa-silverman/) 3 May 2021 • 6:00am   
 

Renee Watson, a healthy 43-year-old, has received both her coronavirus jabs already. Meanwhile, the UK Covid infection rate has dwindled and the size of our vaccinated population has swelled. Lockdown is easing, pavement cafes and beer gardens are teeming, and life is inching back to something more like normality.

But not so much for Watson, nor those like her who may be suffering – to a greater or lesser degree – from what has been termed [Covid anxiety syndrome](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/forgotten-make-small-talk-suffering-re-entry-anxiety/). Watson, an entrepreneur who was once “quite a risk-taker” feels far happier playing it safe now.

“I thought I’d spring back and return to being keen to go to restaurants and shopping,” says the mother-of-two from Oxfordshire. “But I’ve really not wanted to at all. I’m still ordering everything online. It’s not like me, it’s strange: I’m normally a sociable person and like going to festivals but it feels like too much risk at the moment.”

Watson’s response to the easing of lockdown is not all that uncommon, say psychologists. It is not yet known how many people will be affected by residual Covid anxiety after vaccination, but it’s feared a significant minority will struggle to readjust, especially as increased unlocking allows for large groups and big, crowded events to take place again.

While many of us are enjoying the chance to socialise and travel normally, some are clinging fearfully to the safety behaviours enforced upon us during the pandemic. What was once a rational response to danger has become a “maladaptive” response as the danger recedes.

It was Marcantonio Spada, professor of addictive behaviours and mental health at London South Bank University, and Ana Nikčević, a psychology professor at Kingston University, who identified and named the phenomenon of Covid-19 anxiety syndrome.

Early in the pandemic, they hypothesised there would be a number of coping behaviours people would adopt in relation to the perceived threat of Covid, which, while initially helpful, may over time become problematic, especially during the process of reintegration. These behaviours – which may include not touching things, avoiding using public transport, worrying, and monitoring our environment and other people for the presence of the virus – could potentially keep us “stuck”, they suggested.

“In people who use these coping strategies consistently, excessively, daily, with the view they will keep them safe, \[it\] may inadvertently ‘lock’ them into Covid-19-related [fear and distress and hinder their reintegration](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/overcome-fear-going-little-help-germany/) and return to normal,” say the researchers.

Data they have collected in both the US and UK bears out their theory. Their findings suggest that those at a greater risk from the virus are more prone to Covid anxiety syndrome. But Spada believes as many as one in five people could struggle with the return to normality, and that women under 40 may be particularly affected, since other research has shown this demographic to be worst hit by the pandemic psychologically.

For Watson, who studied immunology, it’s the uncertainty surrounding the virus that troubles her. “I’m a massive advocate of vaccines, but Covid has been so unpredictable, it hasn’t behaved like we’d expect a virus of this kind,” she says. “So although I think vaccination will definitely give me a level of protection, I don’t think we yet know fully what that protection will look like, and with the emergence of lots of variants we don’t know how well the current vaccine will protect us against emerging strains. So I don’t necessarily want to put myself at risk. The children going back to school feels like enough of a risk.”

Thoughts like these are echoed in online messaging forums. “The virus hasn’t gone away,” wrote one Gransnet user last month. “Even if like me you have had both vaccinations, there is no guarantee a variant won’t turn up and require more and different vaccines. I don’t intend to go daft now, just because someone says we can.” Another replied: “I’ve got used to living the way I do now and will find it difficult to live normally again.”

Richard, a 53-year-old from north London who works in property, says his worries centre around the failure of others to stick to the rules - and the fact the vaccine does not guarantee 100 per cent protection. “I had my vaccination 12 days ago, but I could still get Covid,” he says. “Even if I wasn’t \[severely\] ill I could still have side effects or long Covid. I do feel nervous. You feel a bit ‘bah humbug’ if you [ask your friends how many people are going to be there](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/life/art-declining-invitations/) when you visit, but I want to put myself at minimal risk.”

Experts say cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can be helpful to “actively break those negative cycles of thought and action,” as Dr Victoria Salem, an endocrinologist and researcher at Imperial College London, puts it.

Salem, who has been working on a study of the syndrome with Spada, has seen evidence of it in her own practice among patients of various ages. “We are seeing it even in people who have been fully vaccinated and that’s worrying because pretty soon we’ll be expecting people to go back to much more normal routines,” she says.

Owen O’Kane, a former NHS clinical lead for mental health and author of *Ten Times Happier*, predicts an increase in anxiety disorders as we emerge from lockdown, not only centering around the fear of Covid itself but also broader worries about reintegration. “I’m seeing people who weren’t socially anxious now struggling with lockdowns easing and having to socially interact. Also an increase in people finding public spaces claustrophobic or too busy.”

Fear of missing out has, for some, become [fear of going out](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/mind/help-friend-afraid-go/). O’Kane, a psychotherapist, suggests a proportion of the population will suffer from what he calls “post-pandemic stress disorder” and says: “We’re not going to see the true impact until the pandemic is completely over.”

Indeed, the true scale of the problem is likely to be larger than what is evident now. “The trauma aspect of this has been understated,” he says. “Many people, to a degree, have experienced some trauma. We’ve been locked away for a year by and large, all our routines have changed, we’ve been watching horrific headlines every day and are constantly engulfed in a culture of fear. Unquestionably that’s going to traumatise people.”

Clinicians can help by encouraging people to “step out of fear mode” and start making some gradual behavioural changes, he says. “You’d encourage people to drop the safety behaviours and say ‘this is keeping you more anxious.’”

Prof Nikčević is broadly optimistic. “We believe the majority of people will be able to release these coping strategies \[eventually\],” she says. “We need to gradually encourage \[them\]...so people can, over time, release these mental controls.”

For Watson, it will be a matter of watching how things play out. “I don’t think rushing to get back to being in densely populated areas at the moment is going to do any of us any favours,” she says. “I’m just going to take it easy and see what happens.”",,,1620060648,{},gwsvp67,True,t3_n406w1,False,False,t3_n406w1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n406w1/vaccinated_but_wont_go_out_the_rise_of_covid/gwsvp67/,1620093178,53,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It's always possible a booster shot will be needed. At this point we don't know yet, though so far the vaccines seem very promising and effective against the variants, and immunity seems to be sticking, so we'll definitely have to see.

&gt; Pfizer and Moderna said that the vaccines are effective for 6 months after two shots, maybe longer

Probably longer. You have to understand, **every** guidance in things like this is necessarily going to be conservative. They can't say, ""we think it'll work for 5+ years"" when they have literally no data to suggest that.

&gt; If we end up needing this every year, then yes, we need to think about long term effects

No, again, almost certainly not. Even a dose every year or six months is not going to be at a high enough rate that it causes some long term effect - again, how would that even work?

But at this point, we may need **a** booster shot, but based on how effective the vaccines are against variants, I doubt we'll need more than 2-3 boosters at most over our lifetimes, as long as some sort of fastly evolving strain comes about, or one that is very difficult to create a vaccine for.

&gt; The difference is that the tech behind this vaccine is very new

It's not really. It's been discussed since the 80s and active work has been done on it for over 10+ years, since the original SARS. It's the first commercial use, but it's a pretty explored technology.

&gt; It's done with gene editing

No, it isn't. It's done with mRNA. mRNA does not, and **cannot** edit genes. You would need some sort of DNA polymerase or some other molecule that can cut DNA, add a relevant sequence and stitch it back together. The vaccine has none of that, and it can't magically appear out of thin air. These are all highly specific types of molecules, and they don't just arise out of nothing. Trust me, if we could easily do somatic gene therapy, a **LOT** of diseases we currently have would disappear overnight.

To be clear, we’re talking about the funding, not really the research and production itself. Either way, I don’t think either is global in the sense that you’re talking about. Almost all of the major production steps are being done in the US and Europe, as was most of the research. The funding also came primarily from those areas, which is why they have received most of the doses. I don’t know how equitable it really is for the countries who put in most of the money and effort to develop and produce the vaccines to get a disproportionately small number of the doses.

&gt;	Also, it’s in the self-interest of high-income countries to ensure this equitable distribution to tackle this pandemic in a globally coordinated manner; those mutant strains in India, South Africa, Latin America can just as easily spread in wreak havoc in high-income countries.

It’s in their self interest to donate excess doses, sure. I don’t think it’s in their interest to donate doses that they themselves would use.

I'm in Finland, and I was amazed that the Australian government is getting away with that, especially since they apparently have effective mandatory quarantine facilities in place.

When the Finnish government first implemented travel restrictions in March 2020, their statements read like they were orders. When the first wave of the epidemic was over in the summer, the government was criticized for the wording, because legally, the restrictions were recommendations, not legally binding orders. The citizens of Finland always have a constitutional right to leave the country, and to return to Finland (getting into any other country is another question, of course). Testing and quarantine can be enforced, but you can't deny a citizen's right to cross the border. Non-citizens are another matter, and Finland has forced a lot of people to turn around at the border, including other EU citizens.

I was also kind of amazed at the internal restrictions in Australia, too. They have closed the borders of their states for different periods during the pandemic, in Victoria and New South Wales at least. That was strictly enforced, too. You couldn't drive out of Melbourne for months last year. Finland did that with Uusimaa, which is the province that includes Helsinki, for three weeks a year ago. That was with the government having declared emergency conditions (akin to war) and using emergency powers that are legally allowed only when they're ""absolutely necessary"". The blockade was lifted early because the epidemic turned into decline and the government couldn't claim necessity any more. The Australians kept that up for months, with way fewer infections than we had. And I suppose they had a point - they eradicated the virus from the country.

Patients who were not sick enough to be hospitalized still had a significantly greater risk of dying within six months than people who were not infected.

The health effects of Covid-19 not only can stretch for months but appear to increase the risk of death and chronic medical conditions, even in people who were never sick enough to be hospitalized, a large new study finds.

In the study, published Thursday in the journal Nature, researchers looked at medical records of more than 73,000 people across the United States whose coronavirus infections did not require hospitalization. Between one and six months after becoming infected, those patients had a significantly greater risk of death — 60 percent higher — than people who had not been infected with the virus.

The research, based on records of patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs health system, also found that nonhospitalized Covid survivors had a 20 percent greater chance of needing outpatient medical care over those six months than people who had not contracted the coronavirus.

The Covid survivors experienced a vast array of long-term medical problems that they had never had before — not just lung issues from the respiratory effects of the virus, but symptoms that could affect virtually any organ system or part of the body, from neurological to cardiovascular to gastrointestinal. They were also at greater risk of mental health problems, including anxiety and sleep disorders.

“We found it all,” said an author of the study, Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, chief of the research and development service at the VA St. Louis Health Care System.

“What was shocking about this when you put it all together was like ‘Oh my God,’ you see the scale,” he added. “It’s still jarring, honestly.”

What’s more, some of the patients’ post-Covid medical issues — like diabetes, kidney disease and some heart problems — could become chronic conditions that would require treatment for the rest of their lives.

“People have continued respiratory disease, continued headache, this, that and the next thing,” said Dr. Laurie Jacobs, chairwoman of internal medicine at Hackensack University Medical Center, who was not involved in the study. “It’s not gone away. And we don’t yet understand the underlying cause, and it’s become chronic in some cases, disabling in other cases. In some areas, people have gotten better, but it’s very variable.”

The study is believed to be the largest yet to evaluate such a comprehensive array of health conditions. The non-hospitalized Covid survivors in the study tested positive for the virus from March 1, 2020, through November.

Most of the nearly 32 million people who have contracted the coronavirus in the United States have not needed hospitalization, so in some ways the study may be applicable to a wide swath of the population. But the Veterans Health System patients in the study may not be representative in other ways, including that 88 percent of them were male and their median age was 61. Nearly 25 percent were Black, 70 percent were white and nearly 5 percent were other races.

Researchers compared their risk of death and other characteristics with data from nearly 5 million patients in the Veterans system who did not have Covid-19 and were not hospitalized during that time. That group had a median age of 67, was 90 percent male and had a somewhat larger proportion of white patients and a somewhat smaller proportion of Black patients.

Dr. Jacobs said her clinic was seeing the wide range of symptoms in the study. But she said the risk of death among the study’s patients was considerably higher than she would have expected. “I was really shocked by the number,” she said.

Between one and six months after experiencing a relatively mild or moderate infection, 1,672 of the 73,345 patients — about 2.3 percent — died, the study reported. It did not indicate what caused the deaths or anything specific about those patients’ conditions.

The researchers also could not say if people had underlying health conditions and whether their new symptoms were direct effects of their coronavirus infection, corollary effects of medications they were taking to treat some of the symptoms, stress from other pandemic-related problems or other influences. Experts said the study’s findings reflect a cascade of issues driven not just by the virus itself but by the medical system’s struggle to grapple with Covid-19 and its long-term effects.

“We have hundreds of thousands of people with an unrecognized syndrome and we are trying to learn about the immune response and how the virus changes that response and how the immune response can include all the organ systems in the body,” said Dr. Eleftherios Mylonakis, chief of infectious diseases at Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School and Lifespan hospitals, who was not involved in the study. “The health system is not made to deal with something like this.”

In many cases, Dr. Mylonakis said, people experiencing new symptoms who were never acutely sick from the viral infection enter a confusing and balkanized medical world, where they seek help from primary care doctors and then are referred to various specialists who each try to figure out how to treat conditions that fall under their particular area of expertise. That helps explain why the study found that the Covid survivors had about one-and-a-half times more outpatient visits a month than patients in the general V.A. population.

“We’re dealing with silos,” Dr. Mylonakis said. “Every time that we have a transfer, something is lost. The patient loses and that may make their other long Covid symptoms worse.”

For example, “if I’m an endocrinologist, I’m going to look at the blood sugar, I’m not going to look at the 14 other systems,” he said. “But the problem with the blood sugar may be because this person has such weakness and fogginess that they cannot go to the supermarket and get healthy foods, so they’re going to order pizza.”

Dr. Mylonakis said the unified nature of the Veterans system may actually make it better at coordinating care and sharing patient information among specialists, so for patients outside that system, the frustration and confusion may add considerable stress that aggravates their symptoms.

Still, the complexity of long-term Covid is abundantly evident within the Veterans system too.

“I have patients that get out of bed for 10 minutes to prepare a salad and they can’t eat it because they’re totally exhausted, so tired by the time they put a small salad together,” said Dr. Al-Aly.

The research showed that Covid survivors were also more likely to be taking a spectrum of medications for their newly emerged health problems, including opioids, which Dr. Al-Aly said was concerning because it might portend another wave of opioid addiction problems in the future.

Dr. Al-Aly and his co-authors Yan Xie and Benjamin Bowe, both at Washington University in St. Louis, also analyzed records of 13,654 patients who had been hospitalized for their initial coronavirus infection. Unsurprisingly, they found that the sickest patients — those who needed intensive care — were at the greatest risk of long-term complications, followed by those who were hospitalized in regular wards, followed by patients who were never hospitalized.

Nonetheless, virtually every category of symptom — from chest pain to shortness of breath to diabetes to muscle weakness — were experienced by at least some of the people who were never hospitalized.

“I would interpret this as saying ‘It’s everywhere,’” Dr. Al-Aly said. “Even if you just stayed at home and then quote-unquote recovered in three or four days. And that’s very important because that segment really is the lion’s share of Covid patients. Most people, when they get Covid, they don’t get hospitalized.”

For people who were hospitalized, their experiences involved significantly greater risk of long-term health complications than people hospitalized for seasonal flu, the study found. They were more likely to develop or have persistent symptoms in a wide array of categories beyond the respiratory manifestations of Covid: neurological, cognitive, psychological, cardiovascular, metabolic gastrointestinal, anemia and blood clotting problems as well as fatigue and malaise.

Dr. Mylonakis and other experts noted that the understanding of the virus and the status of medical treatment are evolving quickly, and this progress is already translating into improvement for some patients. In addition, some people with long Covid have gotten better over time, either on their own or with the help of treatment.

Still, Dr. Al-Aly said: “What we will grapple with for years to come, maybe even for decades, is the effect of the pandemic on the long-term health of Americans.”

It's aimed at an educated lay audience so in my opinion it's a bit more readable than Derek Lowe's stuff. (Why would an economic researcher write about this? It's a defense of the importance of spending money on R&amp;D even when we don't get immediate results. Biotech stockholders lost money in the short term but the world got a huge win in the long term.)

The parts about mRNA vaccines for HIV are in section 6, ""Nucleic Acid Vaccines"" which concludes thusly:

&gt; By 2019, just months before SARS-Cov-2 was about to enter the world stage, mRNA had reached the forefront of vaccine research, with experimental tests of vaccines against influenza, Zika, and Ebola virus as well ([Maruggi et al. 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30803823/)). With many of the problems of packaging mRNA out of the way, and with the possibility of streamlined fabrication of mRNA vaccines on demand, it has become clear in retrospect that if mRNA vaccines actually worked, they would be the first out of the starting gate in the race for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

Here are the mRNA-related papers which they reference in that section:

[Pollard et al. 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538310/) - mRNA vaccine testing for HIV in mice

[Bogers et al. 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25234719/) - mRNA vaccine testing for HIV in rhesus macaques

[Pardi et al. 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29326426/) - Review of diseases for which mRNA vaccines and treatments had been in trials

[Leal et al. 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30289805/) - mRNA vaccine testing for HIV in humans, Phase I safety trial (they concluded it was safe)

[Maruggi et al. 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30803823/) - Summary of how mRNA is a promising technology for many future vaccines

For diseases besides HIV.... [Here](https://www.modernatx.com/pipeline) is what all Moderna is working on and [here](https://biontech.de/science/pipeline) is what BioNTech is working on.

The new census reports that [NJ has roughly 9.3 million people](https://www.njspotlight.com/2021/04/nj-population-grows-to-over-9-2-million-census-says/). The goal (which granted could shift slightly due to the extra half a million people in the recent census count) was [4.7 million](https://covid19.nj.gov/pages/vaccine?fbclid=IwAR21yn3Jyo5mapuNNhxXi3qve6PsBPEfP3mL3uTEUweEPgr5e65_iUvLVIM) fully vaccinated people which would be 70%.

At time of writing we're just about 62,000 out from hitting the goal of 4.7 million.

We're still administering well past 70,000 doses daily and while they aren't all first doses, we'll probably hit 4.7 million by early to mid next week if we don't blow past it before then. After that it'll be 3-4 weeks for that group to get their second shot.

So to answer your question of how long do we realistically have to wait: Not long. No one needs to get ""bribed into it"". It'll just make it go faster for everyone but at this rate I imagine by mid June we're going to hit the 4.7 million number fully vaccinated.

Even India, the “world’s pharmacy” with enough factory capacity, is constrained by raw materials, not intellectual property.

This initiative isn’t really about a GoFundMe for buying vaccine doses.  It’s a roundabout way to help people realize what a privilege they have by living in the first world, and to encourage them to value the vaccines they can get for free enough to actually take the time to get vaccinated.

I will say that what is happening to children in Brazil with respect to COVID-19 is a crisis. 

But I did say that the deaths were real. You literally kept writing that they were not. 

And I called you out on that. 

I am a Toxicologist. I read the poison control reports each year. 

Even if it is just one person dying from a particular cause it's still worth noting for someone like me. 

And as someone who has worn full face respirators in the summer, I don't find wearing a mask to help keep people alive while we work on getting more people vaccinated a major imposition. 

And I am not sure what you think is happening, but having people mask up and be quarantined for a global respiratory virus pandemic is what you are supposed to do. 

It's what they did when my grandfather was alive. 

And speaking of old people.

Dead. The word you are choosing not to use is dead. 

Kids were quarantined so old people would not get dead. 

And let's be honest they missed their freedom a lot longer than needed because a whole bunch of adults acted selfishly. 

But the kids were mostly grown ups about it. More so than a lot of the actual adults. 

But as someone who has seen small children mask up to see their grandpa with MRSA that doesn't surprise me. 

Look, it's simple if you don't want to respect other people's right to life, which did come before liberty in that whole declaration of independence, go find an island. 

But if you want to live in a society, you have to value other people's right to live. 

It's why they don't let you drive on the sidewalk. 

That is true even if it would be a teenager driving over an elderly couple on the sidewalk. 

Even kids don't get to experience absolute freedom because one person's freedom to sometimes has to end where another person's freedom from begins. 

But hey, if you're confused about what a complete lack of human rights looks like, go look into modern day slavery. 

And it may shock you but a lot of us are enjoying quite a few human rights these days. 

I don't even have to wear a mask outside anymore. Facts. Science. Powerful stuff.

Your reading is based on fear first and foremost and an abundance of caution second. It's not rooted in the actual words coming out of the mouths of the people you say you trust.

* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC demographic data, so the tables do not match national totals.

This is a really horrible article for a few reasons.

While yes, other countries have now pledged more, Canada was one of, if not the biggest contributer per capita to COVAX in 2020.   Biden to his credit earlier this year reveresed Trump's decision to not contribute it and contributed to it with large amounts and convinced other countries, especially the EU to increase their contribution.  Canada did too, but they focused on other measures for the most part in increased funding.  But Canada's 2020 funding went a long way in trying to help set up manufacdturing at Covax facilities.

Canada, while doing good on it own right now, is still nowhere near the US or UK levels of vaccination, so why would Canada be the one sharing vaccines at this point?  We'll share a decent chunk (though we are talking of trying to defer some of our deliveries).   We will regardless have a ton of excess vaccines eventually.

We've pledged aid to India, some even that will get our government in some hot water with the idiotic nationalists of our country.    We may be able do more.   But it's also not like we are in the clear here.  We have a province that is on par, if not exceeding India's per capita daily infection rate (granted, REPORTED infection rate).   But we're still sending aid.  But we currently don't have the vaccines to spare.  If we had a vaccine producer, and India purchased vaccines from them, I'd hope we returned the favour and didn't interfere with the export of those vaccines, but we don't.  And we aren't complaining about the SII not sending over the 1 million doses we purchased to be delivered in April or the 500k that were supposed to be delivered this month.

&gt; She was meeting the chief executives of BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Curevac and Sanofi, and it was not quite clear from where the EU was going to find the jabs it needed.

&gt; A meeting with the French president, Emannuel Macron, followed on the Monday and a second with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Tuesday. The following day Breton, a former head of multinationals including France Telecom and Atos, was made head of a new EU vaccine task force.

&gt; “At that point the challenges were quite fundamental: getting transparency about what kind of capacity was operational,” said an EU official of the task facing Breton. “Where are these factories and where they are going and what the bottlenecks were. A lot of work to do in a short space of time. It was primarily mapping.”

&gt; Since then, EU diplomats representing the member states have spoken admiringly of a hands-on approach that has produced results. “Breton has been to factories where even the CEOs of companies have not visited,” said one diplomat.

&gt; During a visit to a “fill and finish” site in Barcelona that is serving the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, Breton was told that a lack of filters risked delaying the final stages of production by four weeks. He used his direct contact with the chief executive of the German supplier Merck to find a fix.

Citation needed.  

Bill Gates advocated for Oxford to find a competent pharmaceutical industry partner, because he was concerned that poorly manufactured vaccines would create vaccine hesitancy. He also *has explicitly funded zero-royalty vaccine production in India of the AstraZeneca vaccine*.  See 10:34 in this interview:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grv1RJkdyqI

&gt;	G: Well the making a safe vaccine is more complicated than say making a jet engine and people are very picky about vaccines in fact you could ruin the reputation of vaccines if you're making them in factories where the quality control at every stage is not exquisite. and you know any mistake you know you can have that factory shut down literally for months at a time when its output is needed to save millions of lives. So vaccine factories are not something that you just you know you know like open source code that you can take and you know mess around with and so the the limitations on how many vaccines are being made, that's based on how many great capable vaccine manufacturers there are in the world 

&gt;	**and we’ve made sure that the AstraZeneca’s being made in these big indian factories and there’s no royalty for that, no charge at all. Now we’ve had to fund that, the Gates Foundation. These are companies we’ve been working on their factory quality for over a decade so that there was spare capacity to make inexpensive vaccines so Oxford University is is wonderful, but they’re not capable of doing a phase three trial and they they don’t have factories**

My 13 year old on the other hand is a disaster.  I can't tell if her academic struggles stem from the online friend group she's fallen into (she's been spending most of her free time ""hanging out"" virtually with 15-16 year old friends that she met through her older sister, and they aren't the best influence as far as I can tell), remote learning, or both, but in general she's a total disaster.  This will be news she'll be excited to see.  

Still, they both know that we're going to keep being careful until we know more.  At the moment it seems like vaccinated people don't transmit the virus, but since we have a 6 year old who may be vulnerable (she's starting to show signs of the same allergy issues that I had as a kid, and mine also revealed that I have asthma--we haven't taken her in yet as this just started showing up in the last few months and we're waiting until at least my wife and I are fully vaccinated to start making doctors appointments), getting the shot won't mean suddenly throwing our doors open to everyone and anyone.  

The 16 year old is furious about this because she wants to spend every waking second with her boyfriend, but her boyfriend is from a COVID-denying, anti-mask family (who got the shot before anyone else through personal connections, imagine that), and hangs out with others that are also in that category as well as being anti-vaxxers.  Until we know for sure he can't be a carrier, he's not walking through that door.

Notes:

* The raw data can be downloaded exact totals for every age group can be downloaded from the [CDC vaccination demographic trends page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends) as a CSV.  The CDC indicates the data is by ""Date Administered"", but it actually appears to be by ""Date Reported"".
* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC demographic data, so the tables do not match national totals.
* The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group.

[],,StudlyPenguin,,,[],,,,text,t2_lms3r,False,False,[],"We see here \[1\] the CDC says 8 per 100K were hospitalized for Covid-19. I suspect this is a low number because this was published in August before some of the newer strains, but we'll run with it.

We see here \[2\] that the flu vaccine reduces hospitalizations in kids by 40%-60%. To your point, it explicitly mentions that this is in spite of the vaccine not matching up well against the mutated variants.

Here \[3\] we see pediatric flu vaccination rates are \~60%

Here \[4\] we see flu hospitalization rates are 17.3 per 100K for kids 5-17

So if we assume that all 17.3 per 100K are non-vaccinated, AT BEST the 60% flu vaccine reduction gets us to like, 7 out of 100K flu hospitalization rate, which is in line with 8 per 100K for (obviously non-vaccinated) kids above

So at this point I would be willing to concede my argument above, except that this analysis so far assumes every kid's infection risk is equal for Covid and Flu. Here \[5\] the CDC estimates let's call it 56 million flu cases for the 2019-2020 season, which was pretty bad. For a roughly 1-year period, the CDC estimates \[6\] 114M cases of Covid. So factoring increased transmission, a kid was at roughly twice the hospitalization risk for Covid as the flu?

But with how many vaccinated Americans we have now and how many people have already had Covid, we're not going to see that many cases again over the next year. **I am left to conclude that I probably can't justify covid &gt; flu for kids by the available science.**

I would rephrase /u/lebron_garcia's question, though. No, I did not keep my kid home during the *entire* 2019-2020 flu season. That would be silly. **Risk is a spectrum, not a boolean.** So yes, I did keep an eye on our county's flu rates during that season, and there were some weeks I went shopping by myself and left my kid with my partner because the numbers were so bad. There were other weeks I recommended we skip the trip to the bowling alley. For a couple of weeks before our trip to Disney World, we kinda cut back on the fun outings and stuff because we didn't want to get sick before our $10K vacation. We still did lots of fun things, but we didn't do whatever we wanted willy-nilly without analyzing the risks.

I'm tired of this false dichotomy bullshit. Analyze the data, see what the tradeoffs are, and try to make the best decisions you can. There's a pretty comfortable life in between ""live in a nuclear bunker"" and ""the pandemic's over! EVERYONE GO TO CHUCK-E-CHEESE""

Posting here in the general daily discussion with the massive drop in doses today. 

It is getting clear that herd immunity is not possible through vaccinations, at least not without a long delay towards the end of the calendar year, with a slowdown in vaccination trend. The date for fully vaccinating enough of the adult population is already approaching Governor Charlie Baker's date of August 1st for reopening. This is even with Massachusetts being the top 2 in the US in vaccinations.

**CDC** update on first dose shots:

16,426 first dose shots. Last week 39,005. 

7 day rolling avg is now 38,433. 41,659 yesterday. 

3,965,973 MA residents have first doses - 57.54% (3,949,547 - 57.30% yesterday)

71.58% of adults now

At this rate, the first dose shots:

On

May 15th - 4,427,172

May 31st - 5,042,105

June 15th - 5,618,604

**Eligible population numbers (based on 5,540,726 population)**

On

May 15th - 79.90%

May 31st - 91.00%

June 15th - 101.41%

80% on 5/16 (- 10 days)

90% on 5/30 (- 15 days)

95% on 6/6 (- 18 days)

**Total population numbers (based on 6,892,503 population)**

On

May 15th - 64.23%

May 31st - 73.15%

June 15th - 81.52%

60% on 5/8 (- 7 days)

70% on 5/26 (- 13 days)

75% on 6/4 (- 17 days)

80% on 6/13 (- 20 days)

**Fully vaccinated estimates**

Using the date for 95% of adults with dose 1, if all of them get a second dose 31 days later (1 month for Moderna), plus an additional 14 days for immunity to kick in, that will put us at a date of: Wednesday, July 21st (- 18 days), for 95% of adults fully vaccinated.

Notes: 

* If the Pfizer EUA is expanded to age 12, the eligible population will be updated to approximately 6,101,782, which is the estimated 12+ population using the 2020 census (7,029,917 overall) (not 2019 estimate)",,,1620068023,{},gwtddc4,False,t3_n3pzvk,False,True,t1_gwt97w9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n3pzvk/daily_discussion_thread_may_03_2021/gwtddc4/,1620102837,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Taiwan became the latest place to ban arrivals from coronavirus-stricken India on Monday, as it moves to prevent new infections, with more nations reporting cases of a variant first identified in the subcontinent.

The variant, B.1.617, has reached at least 17 countries, from Britain and Iran to Switzerland, sparking global concern and spurring several to close their borders to people travelling from India.

Scientists are studying whether the variant, resulting from two key mutations to the outer ""spike"" portion of the virus that attaches to human cells, is driving an unexpected explosion in cases in India. 

The south Asian nation's tally of infections was just shy of 20 million on Monday, after it reported more than 300,000 new coronavirus cases for a 12th straight day. 

Last month, Indonesia, which has been battling one of Asia's worst COVID-19 outbreaks, stopped issuing visas for foreigners who had been in India in the previous 14 days.

""We need to contain these cases, while there are still only a few of them,"" said Indonesian health minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin, after the first two cases of the variant reported in the southeast Asian nation on Monday. 

Neighbouring Malaysia said on Sunday it had detected its first case of the Indian variant, days after imposing a ban on flights from the country. 

On Monday, Taiwan said that except for its citizens, all those who had been in India in the 14 days prior would be barred from entering its territory, while returning Taiwanese face 14 days in centralised quarantine facilities. L1N2MQ08Z

The move comes after Australia took a more drastic measure last week, banning the entry of residents and citizens who have been in India in the previous two weeks, threatening fines and jail for any who disobey. read more
It was the first time Australia has branded citizens' return home a criminal offence.
Australia defended the ban, which took effect on Monday, saying it had a ""strong, clear and absolute"" belief that the move was legal. read more
""It's a high-risk situation in India,"" Health Minister Greg Hunt told a televised news briefing.

""The strong, clear view is that there has been no doubt in any of the Commonwealth advice about this.""
Philippine officials warned that they could not rule out the possibility of an India-like COVID-19 crisis, saying last week's decision to ban entry of arrivals from India aimed to keep it from becoming a reality.
""It is possible for it to happen here if we don’t intensify responses,"" Health Undersecretary Rosario Vergeire said.
""When we look at what is happening in India, it is happening across the globe... What’s different is the intensity of it.""

The World Health Organisation designates the variant as being ""of interest"", suggesting it may have mutations that would make the virus more transmissible, cause more severe disease or evade vaccine immunity.
Other strains with known risks, such as those first detected in the Brazil, Britain and South Africa, have been categorised as ""variants of concern,"" a higher threat level.",,,1620059824,{},gwstqr1,True,t3_n40mhh,False,True,t3_n40mhh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n40mhh/taiwan_bars_arrivals_from_india_as_indonesia/gwstqr1/,1620092095,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,benh999,,,[],,,,text,t2_2bqswhg2,False,False,[],"Taipei, May 3 (CNA) Taiwan on Monday confirmed two new domestic cases of COVID-19, bringing the number of cases linked to Taiwan's China Airlines (CAL) and an airport hotel in Taoyuan to 26, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).

One of the two cases was a Taiwanese man in his 40s who was working on a renovation project as a subcontractor at the Novotel Taipei Taoyuan International Airport hotel, which has emerged as the source of a COVID-19 cluster over the past week.

The man developed a cough on April 28 and visited a medical clinic on April 30. He was arranged to be tested for COVID-19 the next day, according to Health and Welfare Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the CECC.

When asked why the man was not immediately quarantined when the first case in the hotel cluster was confirmed on April 29, Chen said it was because the man did not have much contact with other hotel employees, and no guests were staying on the floors he was working on.

Some subcontractors were asked to quarantine while others were only asked to monitor any symptoms they might develop, Chen said, but that approach has now changed, with all of the subcontractors asked to isolate themselves.

The CECC is still looking into where the man went prior to testing positive and does not know how he became infected.

Chen said the CECC has some ideas, but will not offer an explanation until it gets more clarity on the situation.

The second domestic COVID-19 case confirmed Monday, an Indonesian national in her teens, is a family member of a CAL cargo pilot who tested positive for the disease in Australia on April 20.
Two other family members of his have also tested positive since.

As of Monday, 10 CAL cargo pilots, eight relatives of CAL cargo pilots, five people who worked at Novotel and three of their family members have tested positive for COVID-19 over the past two weeks, according to the CECC.

The cases of the Novotel employees, their family members, and the pilots' relatives have been classified as domestic cases, but the CECC has not yet classified the pilots' infections.

Because some of the CAL pilots stayed at the Novotel before testing positive, and the genome sequencing of the virus in the pilots and a hotel employee matched, there is a possibility that the cases are connected, though the chain of infection is unclear, the CECC said.

The Novotel airport hotel is part of CAL's complex in Taoyuan, which comprises the Taiwanese carrier's headquarters and training facilities.

The hotel is also used to quarantine flight crews of CAL and other airlines, and as a venue for accommodation, conferences and dining by the general public.

The six imported cases reported Monday, meanwhile, came from the Netherlands, Indonesia and Uzbekistan. Five involve foreign nationals who came to work as crew members on ships or fishermen, and one a Taiwanese national who returned from a business trip.

To date, Taiwan has recorded 1,145 cases of COVID-19, 1,003 of which have been classified as imported. Of the total, 1,058 have recovered, 12 have died, and 75 are in the hospital, according to CECC statistics as of Monday.

Globally, COVID-19 has infected over 152.3 million people in 193 countries and regions, with more than 3.2 million fatalities, CECC figures show.

&gt;**Any adverse side effects from vaccines almost always “show up within the first two weeks, and certainly by the first two months,**” said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.

&gt;The **most serious vaccine side effects in history have all been caught within six weeks**, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.

&gt;“I would say, **please tell me what vaccine has ever been shown to cause a long-term side effect that was not picked up in the first two months**,” said Offit, a co-creator of the rotavirus vaccine who has studied vaccinology for more than four decades.

I acknowledge it's rarity as a cause of death. 

But when you are within an order of magnitude in terms or risk I don't see a need to argue with you about that. 

However, you keep downplaying the virus by continuing to state that it doesn't kill kids. 

That is simply not true. 

Oddly you also keep acknowledging that it kills kids in your replies by bringing up the number kids killed by swimming pools and moose. 

Maybe there is some threshold above which children's deaths start to have significance for you. 

But I assure you those COVID-19 deaths had significance for the people who had to bury those children. 

You are entitled to your own opinions. But not your own facts. 

The fact is that children have died from COVID-19. 

In the US it has killed enough kids to empty a few classrooms. 

In Brazil it has killed enough kids to empty a few schools. 

And how are countries keeping more of their kids alive irrelevant to anyone who actually cares about kids?

This virus is endemic because it lives in both animals and people. 

Viruses that are endemic but only live in people can be controlled and in the case of smallpox eradicated. 

This virus lives in animals too so we cannot eradicate it. 

But it's not like we are helpless.  I never got to work from home. So I have been exposed to the virus. 

But I also spent much of that time looking at the raw data from countries and their Covid-19 clinical trials. 

That is why I spent a year masked up and eating in my car and got vaccinated as soon as it became available. 

I had hundreds of temperature checks and the only fever I got for over year was just a sign that the vaccine worked. 

Science kept me safe. Science kept my family safe. 

Science could and should be keeping many more families safe. 

And I brought up polio because we would already be rid of that endemic but only in people virus if people had not politicized getting vaccinated against it too. 

Saying this virus doesn't kill kids won't make it true. 

But it could make it less likely for people to do what they should be doing to make this virus less deadly. 

And I don't know if you get that when you are talking about how endemic diseases become less lethal over time you are still talking about ebola, smallpox, measles and malaria. Which stayed pretty lethal after being around for generations. 

And finally even when it doesn't kill children, or cause major injury, kids getting COVID-19 puts adults at risk.

And no kid wants to grow up knowing they might have unintentionally killed their teacher or grandparent. 

And I know you probably just want me to call you names. 

But at the end of the day I really just want someone to make ""To investigate, record and make public the causes of fatal treatment resistance in clinical trials in Canada"" a line in a law. 

That's the rational way to save a whole lot of lives in Ontario.

The small business that can't afford to bring people back or pay them full wages because if they do another shutdown ruins them, and larger corporate businesses where the parent company has used covid as an excuse to pay new hires a full 2-3 dollars an hour less usually for part time work.

This made me question whether I should have just powered through without taking anything given that I didn't really need to take them.

Both groups are highly vaccine hesitant and it's reflected in the state's demand (as well as the demand of the rest of the Deep South).

S. Korea faces looming COVID-19 vaccine shortage

KDCA countered the above article that there are about 345 thousand AZ shots left, not 166,716 shots ( 381 thousand shots expected to administer thanks to LDS syringes ) and 7m doses will be delivered from mid-May sequentially according to the contract.

That has nothing to do with whether or not you should take a vaccine that is freely available to you.

&gt;Second of all we genuinely don’t know the long term effects of these and given the political and economic climate these vaccines were made in I honestly don’t think the costs outweigh the benefits.

Then you are not properly weighing the costs and benefits.  There is no cost to the vaccine, and since 100 million people in America are now fully vaccinated, if there was a real problem we would likely know by now.

&gt;And like I said, I’m probably exposed to Covid on a daily basis so I’m sure my antibodies are to the point that dragging down herd immunity isn’t a problem.

And have you been tested for the antibodies or are you just going on feelings?

&gt;There is no world where we fully eradicate this anyways.

Vaccines eliminate diseases.  They are a proven technology.  We are in a race against mutations right now, and that's what impedes vaccines.

Correct, in a country with 100 million kids it's likely to kill about 100 kids.  That's how fractions and math works.

Because the cost is literally all of your human rights.  You want kids to live under oppressive regimes because they'll be 1 in a million less likely to die assuming the virus is completely destroyed, which it can never be.

According to this ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDtKBXOEsoM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDtKBXOEsoM) ), there are two types of ventilators - Negative pressure and Positive pressure. Negative pressure ventilators were  historically (i.e. iron lung) used in 1920s and had many benefits such as being portable and more readily available but only problem was that the patients movement was restricted and the doctor has limited access to the patients body, which caused a shift towards positive pressure ventilators. These new ventilaros can be both non-invasive and invasive depending on requirements but are generally high-cost so not readily available and require years of training. Positive pressure ventilators can have cause harm to health in the long term too. 

SOLUTION - I would like to propose a solution of using a combination of negative pressure (i.e. torso only iron lung) and positive pressure (oxygen mask like in airplanes) ventilation. Could this work? Can a medic/engineer please tell me?

&gt;It’s hard to know exactly how much more vaccine could be made worldwide if intellectual property restrictions were lifted. But Suhaib Siddiqi, former director of chemistry at Moderna, said with the blueprint and technical advice, a modern factory should be able to get vaccine production going in at most three to four months.

&gt;“In my opinion, the vaccine belongs to the public,” said Siddiqi. “Any company which has experience synthesizing molecules should be able to do it.”

&gt;Back in Bangladesh, the Incepta factory tried to get what it needed to make more vaccines in two ways, by offering its production lines to Moderna and by reaching out to a WHO partner. Moderna did not respond to requests for comment about the Bangladesh plant, but its CEO, Stéphane Bancel, told European lawmakers the company’s engineers were fully occupied on expanding production in Europe.

&gt;“Doing more tech transfer right now could actually put the production and the increased output for the months to come at great risk,” he said. “We are very open to do it in the future once our current sites are running.”

&gt;Muktadir said he fully appreciates the extraordinary scientific achievement involved in the creation of vaccines this year, wants the rest of the world to be able to share in it, and is willing to pay a fair price.

&gt;“Nobody should give their property just for nothing,” he said. “A vaccine could be made accessible to people — high quality, effective vaccines.”",,,1620036983,{},gwrkp6t,False,t3_n3if3j,False,True,t1_gwr4kxx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n3if3j/gates_foundation_who_help_launch_go_give_one/gwrkp6t/,1620065973,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;One thing is clear: Months into the vaccination drive, the CDC has a limited view of how much vaccine is going to waste, where it's being wasted and who is wasting it, potentially complicating efforts to direct doses where they are needed most. Public health experts say having a good handle on waste is crucial to detect problems that could derail progress and risk lives.",,,1620035154,{},gwribfi,True,t3_n3s3of,False,False,t3_n3s3of,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n3s3of/pharmacy_chains_have_wasted_hundreds_of_thousands/gwribfi/,1620064560,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I can't even begin to imagine anything like that happening in Russia. Millions of Russians went to covid hot spots last year, after the pandemic started, and the government brought them back with taxpayers money.

Force measures? To alienate people who are voting for him? Like what force measures? Fines? How are you gonna fine tens of millions of people. To not allow them to work unless they get a vaccine? When there is a lack of workforce as it is. The only incentive they can use is to promise money, and they are already starting to do that. But it is too little too late.

You need to change people's minds with science, but then people are bombarded with messages like yours ""I am asking myself if Sputnik is %95 works, why there are still many cases and deaths in Russia, even the vaccine is approved 8 months ago."" 

It is not if. It's a great vaccine and it works. But there is so much nonsense surrounding it, and people not being scared of COVID at all, so they just don't get vaccinated. 

There are still covid cases because only 10% of people are vaccinated. And the public doesn't think that there are a lot of cases and deaths in Russia. Because the do not see it. Everyone in the government is already vaccinated, they tried to use propaganda, but it is met with even more anti-science conspiracy theory shit on the internet. And the internet is barely regulated and full of anti-vaxxer trolls or just straight up morons. At least twitter is trying to remove those messages. Can't say the same here.

&gt; 
&gt; The endpoint has changed, but the most pressing challenge remains the same: persuading as many people as possible to get the shot.
&gt; 
&gt; Reaching a high level of immunity in the population “is not like winning a race,” Dr. Lipsitch said. “You have to then feed it. You have to keep vaccinating to stay above that threshold.”
&gt; 
&gt; Skepticism about the vaccines among many Americans and lack of access in some groups — homeless populations, migrant workers or some communities of color — make it a challenge to achieve that goal. Vaccine mandates would only make that stance worse, some experts believe.
&gt; 
&gt; A better approach would be for a trusted figure to address the root cause of the hesitancy — fear, mistrust, misconceptions, ease of access or a desire for more information, said Mary Politi, an expert in health decision making and health communication at Washington University in St. Louis.
&gt; 
&gt; People often need to see others in their social circle embracing something before they are willing to try it, Dr. Politi said. Emphasizing the benefits of vaccination to their lives, like seeing a family member or sending their children to school, might be more motivating than the nebulous idea of herd immunity.
&gt; 
&gt; “That would resonate with people more than this somewhat elusive concept that experts are still trying to figure out,” she added.
&gt; 
&gt; Though children spread the virus less efficiently than adults do, the experts all agreed that vaccinating children would also be important for keeping the number of Covid cases low. In the long term, the public health system will also need to account for babies, and for children and adults who age into a group with higher risk.
&gt; 
&gt; Unnerving scenarios remain on the path to this long-term vision.
&gt; 
&gt; Over time, if not enough people are protected, highly contagious variants may develop that can break through vaccine protection, land people in the hospital and put them at risk of death.
&gt; 
&gt; “That’s the nightmare scenario,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University.
&gt; 
&gt; How frequent and how severe those breakthrough infections are have the potential to determine whether the United States can keep hospitalizations and deaths low or if the country will find itself in a “mad scramble” every couple of years, he said.
&gt; 
&gt; “I think we’re going to be looking over our shoulders — or at least public health officials and infectious disease epidemiologists are going to be looking over their shoulders going: ‘All right, the variants out there — what are they doing? What are they capable of?” he said. “Maybe the general public can go back to not worrying about it so much, but we will have to.”",,,1620048163,{},gws37jl,True,t3_n3vs42,False,True,t1_gws36t1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n3vs42/reaching_herd_immunity_is_unlikely_in_the_us/gws37jl/,1620076952,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; 
&gt; Once the novel coronavirus began to spread across the globe in early 2020, it became increasingly clear that the only way out of the pandemic would be for so many people to gain immunity — whether through natural infection or vaccination — that the virus would run out of people to infect. The concept of reaching herd immunity became the implicit goal in many countries, including the United States.
&gt; 
&gt; Early on, the target herd immunity threshold was estimated to be about 60 to 70 percent of the population. Most experts, including Dr. Fauci, expected that the United States would be able to reach it once vaccines were available.
&gt; 
&gt; But as vaccines were developed and distribution ramped up through the winter and into the spring, estimates of the threshold began to rise. That is because the initial calculations were based on the contagiousness of the original version of the virus. The predominant variant now circulating in the United States, called B.1.1.7 and first identified in Britain, is about 60 percent more transmissible.
&gt; 
&gt; As a result, experts now calculate the herd immunity threshold to be at least 80 percent. If even more contagious variants develop, or if scientists find that immunized people can still transmit the virus, the calculation will have to be revised upward again.
&gt; 
&gt; Polls show that about 30 percent of the U.S. population is still reluctant to be vaccinated. That number is expected to improve but probably not enough. “It is theoretically possible that we could get to about 90 percent vaccination coverage, but not super likely, I would say,” said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
&gt; 
&gt; Though resistance to the vaccines is a main reason the United States is unlikely to reach herd immunity, it is not the only one.
&gt; 
&gt; Herd immunity is often described as a national target. But that is a hazy concept in a country this large.
&gt; 
&gt; “Disease transmission is local,” Dr. Lipsitch noted.
&gt; 
&gt; “If the coverage is 95 percent in the United States as a whole, but 70 percent in some small town, the virus doesn’t care,” he explained. “It will make its way around the small town.”
&gt; 
&gt; How insulated a particular region is from the coronavirus depends on a dizzying array of factors.
&gt; 
&gt; Herd immunity can fluctuate with “population crowding, human behavior, sanitation and all sorts of other things,” said Dr. David M. Morens, a virologist and senior adviser to Dr. Fauci. “The herd immunity for a wealthy neighborhood might be X, then you go into a crowded neighborhood one block away and it’s 10X.”
&gt; 
&gt; Given the degree of movement among regions, a small virus wave in a region with a low vaccination level can easily spill over into an area where a majority of the population is protected.
&gt; 
&gt; At the same time, the connectivity between countries, particularly as travel restrictions ease, emphasizes the urgency of protecting not just Americans but everyone in the world, said Natalie E. Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Any variants that arise in the world will eventually reach the United States, she noted.
&gt; 
&gt; Many parts of the world lag far behind the United States on vaccinations. Less than 2 percent of the people in India have been fully vaccinated, for example, and less than 1 percent in South Africa, according to data compiled by The New York Times.
&gt; 
&gt; “We will not achieve herd immunity as a country or a state or even as a city until we have enough immunity in the population as a whole,” said Lauren Ancel Meyers, the director of the Covid-19 Modeling Consortium at the University of Texas at Austin.
&gt; 
&gt; **What the future may hold**
&gt; 
&gt; If the herd immunity threshold is not attainable, what matters most is the rate of hospitalizations and deaths after pandemic restrictions are relaxed, experts believe.
&gt; 
&gt; By focusing on vaccinating the most vulnerable, the United States has already brought those numbers down sharply. If the vaccination levels of that group continue to rise, the expectation is that over time the coronavirus may become seasonal, like the flu, and affect mostly the young and healthy.
&gt; 
&gt; “What we want to do at the very least is get to a point where we have just really sporadic little flare-ups,” said Carl Bergstrom, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. “That would be a very sensible target in this country where we have an excellent vaccine and the ability to deliver it.”
&gt; 
&gt; Over the long term — a generation or two — the goal is to transition the new coronavirus to become more like its cousins that cause common colds. That would mean the first infection is early in childhood, and subsequent infections are mild because of partial protection, even if immunity wanes.
&gt; 
&gt; Some unknown proportion of people with mild cases may go on to experience debilitating symptoms for weeks or months — a syndrome called “long Covid” — but they are unlikely to overwhelm the health care system.
&gt; 
&gt; “The vast majority of the mortality and of the stress on the health care system comes from people with a few particular conditions, and especially people who are over 60,” Dr. Lipsitch said. “If we can protect those people against severe illness and death, then we will have turned Covid from a society disrupter to a regular infectious disease.”
&gt; 
&gt; If communities maintain vigilant testing and tracking, it may be possible to bring the number of new cases so low that health officials can identify any new introduction of the virus and immediately stifle a potential outbreak, said Bary Pradelski, an economist at the National Center for Scientific Research in Grenoble, France. He and his colleagues described this strategy in a paper published on Thursday in the scientific journal The Lancet.
&gt; 
&gt; “Eradication is, I think, impossible at this stage,” Dr. Pradelski said. “But you want local elimination.”

&gt; 
&gt; Now, more than half of adults in the United States have been inoculated with at least one dose of a vaccine. But daily vaccination rates are slipping, and there is widespread consensus among scientists and public health experts that the herd immunity threshold is not attainable — at least not in the foreseeable future, and perhaps not ever.
&gt; 
&gt; Instead, they are coming to the conclusion that rather than making a long-promised exit, the virus will most likely become a manageable threat that will continue to circulate in the United States for years to come, still causing hospitalizations and deaths but in much smaller numbers.
&gt; 
&gt; How much smaller is uncertain and depends in part on how much of the nation, and the world, becomes vaccinated and how the coronavirus evolves. It is already clear, however, that the virus is changing too quickly, new variants are spreading too easily and vaccination is proceeding too slowly for herd immunity to be within reach anytime soon.
&gt; 
&gt; Continued immunizations, especially for people at highest risk because of age, exposure or health status, will be crucial to limiting the severity of outbreaks, if not their frequency, experts believe.
&gt; 
&gt; “The virus is unlikely to go away,” said Rustom Antia, an evolutionary biologist at Emory University in Atlanta. “But we want to do all we can to check that it’s likely to become a mild infection.”
&gt; 
&gt; The shift in outlook presents a new challenge for public health authorities. The drive for herd immunity — by the summer, some experts once thought possible — captured the imagination of large segments of the public. To say the goal will not be attained adds another “why bother” to the list of reasons that vaccine skeptics use to avoid being inoculated.
&gt; 
&gt; Yet vaccinations remain the key to transforming the virus into a controllable threat, experts said.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the Biden administration’s top adviser on Covid-19, acknowledged the shift in experts’ thinking.
&gt; 
&gt; “People were getting confused and thinking you’re never going to get the infections down until you reach this mystical level of herd immunity, whatever that number is,” he said.
&gt;

Safe is not a black-and-white thing, it's matter of degrees.  Even with the best available vaccine, a [~20% chance of infection](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm) is still a hugely significant individual risk for a virus that's still rampantly circulating.  That 20% refers your chance of infection when exposed.  If you're going to throw caution to the wind, you're chance of being exposed skyrockets.

I'll repeat: vaccines are as much a population-level measure as they are a individual one.  The measles vaccine displays similar efficacy to the mRNA COVID vaccines, but measles is practically eradicated in the western world -- thanks to population-level vaccinations -- which is why no one shuts down the economy when there is a rare measles outbreak among an unvaccinated group of idiots.  That high level of protection is powerful at scale and can't gain a foothold when it has no further hosts to infect.

This is all to say... we are not all protected until *we're all protected.*  Until then, we all need to continue do our part.  Selfish ""I got mine, fuck everyone else"" attitudes are only going to stretch out this crisis further.

The good news is that won't be much longer.  We seem to be averaging at a pace of about 1% a day and are currently at over 33% with a first dose, so we'll hit 50% by mid-May.  By the end of the month, that 50% will have taken effect and I think we're going to hit a real turning point.  Also by the end of the month, we'll hit 70%.

&gt;A national collegiate champion in wrestling, Suriano took a year off from competing for Rutgers to prepare for the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo. After the Games were postponed for a year because of the coronavirus pandemic, Suriano doubled down, skipping another year of college and moving to Phoenix from his home in New Jersey to join a special training group.

&gt;For eight months, he thought of little besides maintaining his health and claiming a place on the United States team by winning at the Olympic trials. Many considered him the favorite in the 125-pound class. “I was at the healthiest point in my life,” he said.

&gt;But only days before the start of the trials on April 2 in Texas, a nasal swab changed everything. Suriano tested negative for the coronavirus before boarding a plane bound for Fort Worth, then tested positive shortly after he arrived.

&gt;He never got a chance to take the mat. His Olympic dream, years in the making, was over.

&gt;”It’s a lot for me to wrap my head around,” he said in an interview from his home.

&gt;The pandemic has been wreaking havoc with sports in general, and the Olympics in particular, for more than a year. Lives and careers have been upended, reimagined and remade. But with the Games scheduled to start in less than three months, the space to adapt has disappeared, and some virus-related obstacles are now likely to be insurmountable.

&gt;In March, eight fencers from six countries tested positive at a qualifying competition in Budapest, Hungary, where they were placed in quarantine and prohibited from competing. Early last month, a judo team from India had to withdraw from a qualifying competition in Kyrgyzstan after two athletes from the squad tested positive. And officials had to cancel the Pan-American canoe sprint Olympic qualifying event that was supposed to take place last month in Brazil, one of the world’s leading virus hot spots. The Olympic berths from the region are now likely to be determined by rankings and by performances from the 2019 world championships.

&gt;For athletes in each case, the lost training time, competition and opportunities to gain qualification points changed the calculus for the Tokyo Games. Some still do not know precisely how — or if — they will book their places in the Olympics, which are to begin July 23.

What if only 60% of the total population is at least partially vaccinated and only 1/5th of the total population has been infected. Which means around 70% should have immunity against COVID-19. This might have been just enough for the older variants, but possible not enough for the newer variants. This is assuming both vaccine and natural immunity is 100%, which it is not. What if another variant pops up due to a partially immune population that is less effected by ""old"" immunity (like making immunity against old variants 20% less effective) you have even less protection in the population. Another problem is that vaccine hesitancy will not be evenly distributed, so there might be places that will have reached herd immunity, while other places are not even close to herd immunity. This leads to the virus spreading mostly freely in certain places, again increasing the risks of worrying variants to form. This might all be a worst case scenario. More people might want to get a vaccine, more people might have already been infected and there will not be any more worrying mutations, it is all plausible.

Herd immunity might be too difficult to achieve, but cases, hospitalisations and deaths can be significantly reduced. Herd immunity is the best/perfect outcome, but it is not too bad if it is not achieved.

Of course, the risk assessment is a lot harder than that as you also need to take additional parameters into account (availability of alternative vaccines, current and projected rate of spread, effect on hospitalization and society at large etc). But my point is that it could make sense to restrict AstraZeneca and wait for other vaccines in some situations (but as the situation varies a lot between countries the best is to simply follow your nation's guidelines).

I mean, that was literally my point. The fact that you say this makes me question if you understand what the word skeptical means. 

It's okay to be skeptical of something that you haven't been convinced of, as long as you aren't unreasonable.

 I'm skeptical that masks are effective at reducing transmission as much as we have been told, but I'm confident that it's better than nothing, so I comply. 

I'm skeptical that the vaccines are as effective as they say with such a short turnaround time, but I'm confident that it's better than nothing, so I got the shots.

I'm skeptical that COVID is even as big of a health risk as we have been told, but I'm confident that the measures they've asked us to take are not so unreasonable that we shouldn't comply. So I comply. 

Any of those statements, posted here on their own, would be downvoted heavily and I would be called stupid and anti-science, or be called a liar and told that I don't follow the rules.

Restrictions aren’t a negotiating chip - they’re part of a necessary response to a public health crisis, just like vaccines are.  It isn’t an “either or” situation;  we need both.

The UK is reopening because despite a mediocre first-doses-only vaccination effort, they also maintained their strict lockdown until metrics improved.  The US is mired in a mini fourth wave because we did not continue to exercise caution.  Relaxing restrictions too early is far, far worse than maintaining them a little longer than necessary.  As someone who lives in a county that is about to close down today again as a result of renewed outbreaks, the overaggressive mentality you are championing is directly impacting my community.

The incentive to get vaccinated is *to actually solve the problem*.  Normalcy isn’t something the government creates - it’s an end result of taking the right actions to fix a problem.  Masking on public transit is something we implement or not based on risk metrics, and right now it is clear the US is very unlikely to be in a position to relax this before at least July.

A complete opinion piece with actually no evidence. They have Bill Gates' interview with Sky, the same I've quoted above, but they don't actually disagree with anything he said, choosing instead to use blanket statements that he doesn't want to give away the IP when clearly it's not about the IP

Then they give an example of _one_ factory in Bangladesh with ""shiny new equipment from Germany"" that is waiting for licence to manufacture vaccines. But absolutely nothing about what Bill Gates' said - the quality control, the expertise, the infrastructure. Absolutely nothing

Then they talk about Bill Gates' links with pharma. No shit Sherlock, he's working with global vaccination and healthcare programmes for decades, of course he has industry links. Give me evidence that these links are being used to kill people, or harm people or whatever they actually wanted to claim here

And then the other dude, he starts speculating about the malaria vaccine without actual evidence of it being blocked by IP, or the global warming research initiative talking about global consensus on its deployment when in fact the technology is being developed and not being deployed at the moment

Tl;dr they're were grasping at straws to complain about, especially since they did not have an actual rebuttal to Bill Gates' points

.

&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXWhMwixtws

Has nothing to do with Bill Gates. Talks about the IP problem and companies not giving IP, whereas Bill Gates' point was that it's not the IP but infrastructure and quality control which is the problem

.

And here's the kicker, India developed its own vaccine called Covaxin, while it's also producing some vaccines under license.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 182,874 wasted doses as of late March, three months into the country's effort to vaccinate the masses against the coronavirus. ***CVS was responsible for nearly half, and Walgreens was responsible for 21 percent,*** or nearly 128,500 wasted shots combined.

CDC data suggest that the companies have wasted more doses than states, U.S. territories and federal agencies combined. Pfizer's vaccine, which in December was the first to be deployed and initially required storage at ultracold temperatures, made up nearly 60 percent of the tossed doses.

from the article:

&gt; On April 15, at a hearing on the coronavirus pandemic, Rep. Jim Jordan harangued Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Jordan, an outspoken critic of mask mandates, demanded to know when Americans would “get their liberties back and be able to move on with their lives.” Fauci explained that the answer depended on progress in vaccination, which in turn depended on how many people were willing to roll up their sleeves. Jordan, who had passed up an invitation to get vaccinated in December—and had reiterated in March that he was in “no hurry” to get his shot—ignored Fauci’s point and went on with his tirade.

&gt; This is the paradox we’re dealing with as we try to get control of the virus: People who won’t get vaccinated—in many cases, the same people who defy mask orders and other public health measures—are holding us back from resuming normal life. Many of them are deliberate freeloaders. They’re counting on the rest of us to suppress the pandemic—and thereby protect them—by getting vaccinated, while they refuse to do the same.",,,1620053329,{},gwsefbq,True,t3_n3xwwe,False,True,t3_n3xwwe,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n3xwwe/the_biggest_remaining_challenge_in_stopping_the/gwsefbq/,1620083463,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Most media, said we'd be lucky to even get 100m shots for Americans. Everyone wanted everything rushed. The US pretty much shipped those doses to CVS and Walgreens late last year and said get those shots out. So they had to initially roll that out on their own, against no nationwide plan. 

Vaccination sites took a bit time to get up and running, when they did, there was a lot of confusion and difficulty booking. I would guess to say that caused a lot of doses to wait around. I remember reading how doses had to be thrown away because it sat too long, or some places found out they had inadequate cooling. I am guessing again, they played by the book and just threw out doses after a certain criteria of waiting or not being refrigerated. 

This was also against the backdrop of Americans being tired of lock downs and was already going to force their way back to normal. Speed of vaccination was essentially critical. 

When everything is said and done, I am sure there will be a lot more waste to be found. Just look at the 15 million doses from JJ for that bad Baltimore plant.

An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, during public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Under an EUA, FDA may allow the use of unapproved medical products, or unapproved uses of approved medical products in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when certain statutory criteria have been met, including that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. Taking into consideration input from the FDA, manufacturers decide whether and when to submit an EUA request to FDA.

&amp;#x200B;

 FDA Approval: What it means

FDA approval of a drug means that data on the drug’s effects have been reviewed by CDER, and the drug is determined to provide benefits that outweigh its known and potential risks for the intended population. The drug approval process takes place within a structured framework that includes:

* ***Analysis of the target condition and available treatments***—FDA reviewers analyze the condition or illness for which the drug is intended and evaluate the current treatment landscape, which provide the context for weighing the drug’s risks and benefits. For example, a drug intended to treat patients with a life-threatening disease for which no other therapy exists may be considered to have benefits that outweigh the risks even if those risks would be considered unacceptable for a condition that is not life threatening.
* ***Assessment of benefits and risks from clinical data***—FDA reviewers evaluate clinical benefit and risk information submitted by the drug maker, taking into account any uncertainties that may result from imperfect or incomplete data. Generally, the agency expects that the drug maker will submit results from two well-designed clinical trials, to be sure that the findings from the first trial are not the result of chance or bias. In certain cases, especially if the disease is rare and multiple trials may not be feasible, convincing evidence from one clinical trial may be enough. Evidence that the drug will benefit the target population should outweigh any risks and uncertainties.
* ***Strategies for managing risks***—All drugs have risks. Risk management strategies include an FDA-approved drug label, which clearly describes the drug’s benefits and risks, and how the risks can be detected and managed. Sometimes, more effort is needed to manage risks. In these cases, a drug maker may need to implement a Risk Management and Mitigation Strategy (REMS).",,,1620075999,{},gwtvpsj,False,t3_n3u6kx,False,True,t1_gwtr5oh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n3u6kx/coronavirus_vaccine_updates_fda_expected_to/gwtvpsj/,1620112410,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

If the primary manufacturer itself is having trouble producing the doses, how will starting from scratch at a new, inexperienced location with no existing equipment or infrastructure be better?

Europe has also been impacted by these same production issues - they are not unique to COVAX.

Notably, COVAX has been responding by diversifying its supply - just today, a 500 million dose deal has been struck with Moderna, complementing an existing deal with Pfizer.  Once Novavax comes online, that will also greatly improve the supply situation.

I agree it’s frustrating COVAX has not met its goals yet.

Based on current run rate of doses administered (7-day moving average for each state) and the available supply (doses delivered minus doses administered), I calculate ""days of supply"" as a proxy for likely constraint. 

If there are more than 21 days of supply, I assume that the state is demand constrained: the state is probably not able to effectively use all of its doses. 

If there are between 14 and 21 days of supply, it is unclear whether that state is either demand constrained or supply constrained (or just has bad logistics). 

if there are less than 14 days of supply, then I assume the state is supply constrained - if they had more doses, they could probably get more shots in arms. 

No states have become supply constrained that were not already supply constrained since last Sunday. 

6 states became demand constrained (noted with an asterisk below): North Dakota, Illinois, California, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Deleware. 

4 states moved from ""supply constrained"" to ""unclear"": Colorado, New Jersey, Hawaii (note this was due to a data dump last week - this is more a return to normalcy for Hawaii), and Maine. 

No states moved from ""Unclear"" to ""Supply Constrained"". Currently, only Massachusetts, Wisconsin, and Minnesota meet the criteria above to be considered supply constrained. 

Based on trends in data, this is likely the last week any state will be supply constrained (at least under the current definition). This is a pretty significant milestone. While access may remain an issue for some vulnerable populations, it is now true that in any state most anyone who wants a vaccine can get one with relative ease.

First, exponential decline gets really slow at the long end of the curve. It takes much longer to go from 100 to 1 than to go from 100K to 1000. 

More importantly, Rt is also a statistical figure that relies a bit on the central limit theorem to have any meaning. When cases drop down very low, Rt is dominated by local effects - cities, neighborhoods, and even households and their vaccination rate and immunity. A nationwide herd immunity does not inherently mean a local herd immunity. This is why it takes a long time to end diseases endemically. Measles took about 30 years for example (of course, measles is MUCH more contagious than COVID). 

Regardless, the more people vaccinated - and more importantly, the more people are vaccinated EVERYWHERE, the faster the disease is eradicated.

CDC late to update tonight, again. Anyways, 7 day average for dose 1 is now down to where it was March 30th. 

**CDC** update on first dose shots:

39,799 first dose shots. Last week 53,474. 

7 day rolling avg is now 41,659. 43,612 yesterday. 

3,949,547 MA residents have first doses - 57.30% (3,909,748 - 56.72% yesterday)

71.28% of adults now

At this rate, the first dose shots:

On

May 15th - 4,491,112

70% on 5/24 (- 11 days)

75% on 6/1 (- 14 days)

80% on 6/9 (- 16 days)

**Fully vaccinated estimates**

Using the date for 95% of adults with dose 1, if all of them get a second dose 31 days later (1 month for Moderna), plus an additional 14 days for immunity to kick in, that will put us at a date of: Sunday, July 18th (- 15 days), for 95% of adults fully vaccinated.

Notes: 

* If the Pfizer EUA is expanded to age 12, the eligible population will be updated accordingly.

**I need your feedback:**

I did a manual calculation of the number of MA residents who are over 16 as of 2020. Using this formula 
&gt; (2019 adults * (2020 pop / 2019 pop ) + 2019 pop * (% children * (1/9))

I obtained a number of 5,801,293 MA residents who are over 16 as of 2020. This is a 4.7% deviation from the number of 18+ MA adults in 2019. Combined with a 2% increase in population in 2020 (7,029,917) compared to 2019. I'm considering changing both total and adult population numbers to use the 2020 estimates and 16+ estimate. However, this will mean my % values will no longer match the CDC, which still uses 2019 values.

That’s a **minimum** requirement. Now they’re only looking at efficacy data, site inspections, etc. Mostly bureaucratic steps.

The “not being able to sue” is related to the government deciding to take over liability claims in order to remove a measure of risk from vaccine manufacturers who did their due diligence, to reduce the cost per vaccine. If you have some negative effect, the government pays out for it. And if they have some negligence that **should** have been handled by due diligence, you can still sue the manufacturers.

I don't mean that I'm completely uninformed, but I feel I don't know enough about what to look out for or monitor in myself post-vaccination in the very unlikely situation that something should come up.

I know the gist of most of it, but all the information is so cluttered and confusing. One minute it's 4 in a million risk, then it's 6 in 4 million risk, then it's 9.3 in a million risk. Is there no definitive breakdown of everything anyone choosing to get the AZ vaccine should know?

But on my end, I am 27 y/o, male, active and fairly healthy overall with no existing health conditions, so I am most likely all good but still definitely have that slight paranoia at the back of my mind. So if anyone has been vaccinated with the AZ vaccine or has any useful info I should know too, then please do help ya boy out.

Some questions I have to start...

1. Despite TTS/blood clotting being very rare, what are the symptoms of this that I should monitor post-vaccination just to be safe?
2. Anything I should or shouldn't do after my first dose?
3. What is the definitive risk ratio of AZ vaccinations that result in blood clot cases?
4. Being on the younger end of people getting the AZ vaccine, is there anything else I should be cautious of or particularly look out for in myself that an older person wouldn't need to?

The number we should be focused on for deciding our next steps is hospitalizations. Not cases, not deaths, and not vaccination rates. I know cases are an indicator of hospitalizations, and deaths, and vaccination rates are a future indicator of cases, but as we go into these next few months, I'm reminded of our strategy this time last year.

We were focused on flattening the curve, so that our hospitals wouldn't be overwhelmed. Babies, heart attacks, and car accidents don't care about what else is going on, and we need to make sure there is a bed and ICU available for those in need including covid patients.

If hospitals are not over-burdened, we open up a little more. If still not over-burdened, even more. If we are at a case where it's trending towards being over-burdened, we back off and potentially close down more.

As we continue 2021, there will be cases the rest of the year, but they may no longer translate into hospitalizations and deaths like they did before.

People will continue to get vaccinated, but it will move slower, and it's impact will be felt less and less. At some point soon, an extra 75k vaccinated in a state may not make a meaningful impact.

Doesn't the state of continued vaccine rationing in Canada mean anything to him? Has he too been dazzled by the Feds' ""vaccine portfolio"" and is conflating the obscene amount of *pre-ordered* doses with current inventory or deliveries to date?

Our inventory is still insufficient **six months** into the mass vaccination drive. How does he account for the facts that:

i) We're *still* using an untested 16-week spread for administering all two-dose vaccines. Not even the EU and UK during their darkest days of inventory shortages were going out on a limb like this. Unlike there, most Canadians who are half-vaccinated don't have a firm booking for their second appointment. Of if they do, they also know that the second dose booked 16 weeks later can be rebooked to an earlier date whenever authorities deem that we truly have sufficient supply to justify the rebooking.

ii) We're *still* using an age-based or risk-based prioritization for vaccination as opposed to a free-for-all like in the USA. My young(er) and low(er)-risk ass doesn't have the privilege of *booking* an appointment for the first shot until the second half of this month.

iii) Pop-up clinics in hotspots are like reenactments of Hunger Games. In some cases, these have still needed to close temporarily or cancel/defer appointments because of continued shortfalls in Big Pharma's deliveries (\*cough\* Moderna \*cough\*)

iv) Our administration rates routinely drop by the weekend after a strong start earlier in the week as PHUs consistently run down regular but still fairly small deliveries that usually arrive by Monday or Tuesday morning.",,,1620062563,{},gwt08h3,False,t3_n3mpvc,False,True,t3_n3mpvc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n3mpvc/as_india_sees_record_covid19_cases_experts_say/gwt08h3/,1620095744,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;Last week, Pfizer and BioNTech dosed the first healthy children in a global Phase 1/2/3 seamless study to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children 6 months to 11 years of age. The study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on a two-dose schedule (approximately 21 days apart) in three age groups: children aged 5 to 11 years, 2 to 5 years, and 6 months to 2 years.

Exactly this. It is perfectly normal that a lot of people have anxiety at this point, it was a scary year. And something that we’re confronting is that the end is going to be less defined and more gradual than the start of the pandemic. So once we reach the point where, within our specific communities, it serves no more purpose to wait upon vaccination, we need to ask ourselves; how do we personally reacquaint ourselves with normalcy? Again, I think you got it right when you said don’t double down on pandemic habits in a post vaccination society.

 I think it’s fine to work through our individual needs slowly, make it low pressure, the world shouldn’t be going away again soon. The other day I took the CDCs advisement, and I ordered some Five Guys, took it outside to a table instead of eating it in my car, and pondered how it felt to be actually in public without a mask. It felt weird. But that’s fine. Life has weird times. The entire time I kept thinking to myself, I’m vaccinated, I’m outside, and nobody is nearby, therefore by resuming this old activity I’m not hurting anybody. So it’s just taking things at a comfortable pace. I can’t wait to do it again.

People can already do that without being vaccinated... And people were going to Turkey until they banned air travel a couple of weeks ago, but it still doesn't stop people from going there through another countries. And no one could enforce the quarantine before, and I don't see it changing now.

&gt;For instance many US universities will not allow students that does not get vaccinated.

Can't do that. People are gonna be up in arms about that. And students think that they are immune to covid because they are young.

&gt;Many companies pay for their workers to get vaccinated.

All they can is to kindly ask for it, but I doubt a lot of companies have enough money to do that. Especially not the government owned factories or corporations. Still, they probably can offer 20 bucks, better than nothing.

Can't do that when there are not enough of them. They have more leverage than the government.

&gt;We are trying to buy Sputnik V for our country too(Turkey). whenever a new appointment is opened, people quickly filled the appointments and go for a vaccine. Therefore I could not understand the people of countries that does not want to get vaccinated. The same false propaganda is going on in Turkey too but they could not convince more people even for uneducated people. For instance in Turkey vaccination rates for 65+ is %80.
