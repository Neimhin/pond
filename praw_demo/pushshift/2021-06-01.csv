A punitive measure towards the unvaccinated turns into punishment for everyone. My employer is doing the same thing, for exactly this reason.

And it's not their first attempt at such policy - a few weeks ago mask restrictions were going to be lifted based on reaching 65% of vaccinated adults on a per-county basis, or 75% statewide. Three counties were close to hitting those numbers where other counties were in the 30% range. The reason that never got put in place was because the CDC said vaccinated people could do whatever the hell they wanted to everywhere and Gov. Brown was forced to keep her word on following the CDC guidelines, but not without trying to find a way to impose a penalty to people who won't get vaccinated. Local governments in those low-uptake counties won't enforce and won't tell, so the only areas still wearing masks indoors are the areas where it's essentially safer not to.

I'm still looking at case numbers and could still theoretically justify masks, but by June 30 hospitalizations and deaths will be down to influenza numbers and that's where it simply won't make sense at all for anyone anymore, regardless of vaccination status.

* On one of the [CDC source data pages](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccination-Demographics-in-the-United-St/km4m-vcsb) alternate age categories are reported, including 18-29 and 30-39. It should be possible to split up the 25-39 age group data into 25-29 and 30-39 groups.  Would this be useful?  The 25-29 age group has vaccination rates several percentage points lower than the 30-39 age group and is very similar to the 18-24 age group.  The 25-29 age group has a first dose rate around 43.9% and 30-39 is at 52.4%. For comparison, 18-24 is at 43.5% and 25-39 is at 49.5%.
* I'm running into Reddit comment size limits, so I can't easily add additional detail or types of data without removing others or creating additional comments.  What do you find to be the most or least useful tables/data points in these posts?
* Considering dropping the fully vaccinated table from non-Saturday posts since first doses seem to be more closely correlated with the drops in new cases. The fully vaccinated number is also closely correlated with the first dose totals from a few weeks prior. This data would still be available at the CDC website.
* Considering dropping the daily change column(s).  I was previously making daily posts when the changes each day were larger.  Others have been making daily vaccination tracking posts that are more suitable for tracking daily changes and overall vaccination progress.  Daily changes can be tracked at the CDC website.
* Considering adjusting the first table to show the first dose totals for the past \~6 weeks in every update, similar to this:

[],,EvanWithTheFactCheck,,,[],,,,text,t2_1420qr,False,False,[],"If it‚Äôs studied and it‚Äôs determined to be safe, why did the vaccine producers demand legal immunity should the vaccine be shown to not safe for someone?

If you demand Jane take the vaccine for the greater good of other people, and later Jane suffers adverse serious irreversible health effects or even death, it‚Äôs Jane who has to suffer (or die) for that decision, not you.  Jane and her family can‚Äôt sue you for encouraging her to take the vaccine; they can‚Äôt sue the pharma companies who produced the vaccine.  The companies would say they have legal immunity and anyone who chooses to take the vaccine despite knowing that would be accountable for any risk they incur from their decision.  If individuals are forced to be responsible and accountable for the risk, why can‚Äôt they have the freedom to decide to take that risk or not?

If I say to you that due to your urging, I will take the vaccine on the condition that you will be responsible for any adverse effects the vaccine may potentially cause me, including jail time or huge financial compensation from you, would you sign that contract and take responsibility for what might happen to me?  If I suffer serious lifelong complications from taking the vaccine, would you be willing to serve a lifelong prison sentence and pay restitution to my dependents, not to mention pay for my medical bills for treating serious side effects I might experience?  No?  Then how can you demand I take on 100% of the risk?  You wouldn‚Äôt be in a position to ask that of me if you‚Äôre not willing to take accountability.

At the end of the day, the risk of vaccination would be mine to incur, any potential ill effects would be mine to suffer through and live with, and any medical bills that might come arise would be mine to bear alone.  If something happens to me, you suffer none of the negative consequences.  So I get to make that decision ‚Äî not you.

If the argument is we should all share the weight of responsibility for the greater good of the community, why don‚Äôt you take on some of that weight for me and sponsor a vaccine hesitant person by offering to be their legal sponsor to cover them in case things go wrong for them?  Why don‚Äôt we demand the pharma companies that developed these vaccines be stripped of their legal immunity that protects them from being accountable for the potential ill effects of a vaccine they urge us is 100% safe?  What if them doing so would reduce vaccine hesitancy, which in turn would benefit the greater good?  Why are they off the hook, but every individual who is hesitant is blamed for choosing to not bear that personal risk? 

For the record, I am fully vaccinated with 2 doses of moderna.   (I got my second dose in February).  I got vaccinated because I work in healthcare and my employers made it mandatory in January to get jabbed as a terms of my employment.  I tolerated the first dose fairly well, but the second dose knocked me out for two days.  Yet I was held financially responsible for the two days I was out sick from work even though I only got the vaccine because my employers forced me to get it in order to keep my job.  If I chose to get it, I understand eating the cost of not being paid as a consequence of a decision I made ‚Äî but it was THEIR decision to force me to take that risk, yet I was the one who suffered 100% of the consequences of THEIR decision.  It made me realize the people who all but force you to take the risk are not willing to suffer the consequences of their coercion.  It‚Äôs always ‚Äúyou have to take this risk for the benefit of someone else‚Äù because ‚Äúwe are all in this together‚Äù until it‚Äôs your turn to suffer, then it‚Äôs every man out for themselves and they have no obligation to be accountable for the consequences of their coercion.

So ok, you took the jab to protect others.  Are you willing to put your convictions to the test and go to bat for someone else by sponsoring them to take the risk you are asking them to take?  Would to be willing to risk jail time for yourself should things go wrong for them?

There are legitimately a lot of people for whom the covid vaccine is not recommended, due to their specific individual health related comorbidities.

Yet they will bully and vilify people like you who refuse to take the vax at this point in time for the protection of your own health, which is an argument in the same vein.  

Either they label those vulnerable people selfish and bully them into potentially sacrificing their lives ‚Äúfor the greater good‚Äù, or they owe you the same courtesy of respecting your hesitation based on your individual health concerns like they do for the other group.

Upcoming jab invitations only with Pfizer and Moderna


The Cabinet is adopting the Health Council's advice that 60-somethings should henceforth only be vaccinated with Pfizer or Moderna's corona vaccines. In practice, this will mean that Janssen and AstraZeneca will remain on the shelf from now on.

Joris Belgers2 June 2021, 12:30
Pfizer and Moderna are so-called mRNA vaccines, which are not only more effective but also have fewer disadvantages than the 'vector vaccines'. Or, those of AstraZeneca and Janssen, the other two coronavaccines licensed in the Netherlands. ""Because the mRNA vaccines are now widely available and the number of corona infections is now relatively low, the Netherlands can afford this choice in the vaccination program,"" the Health Council writes in an urgent advice that was presented to Minister Hugo de Jonge (Public Health) on Wednesday. The Cabinet has announced that it will adopt the advice.

Benefits-to-risk ratio more favorable
The same very rare but serious side effect has been reported with the Janssen vaccine as with the AstraZeneca vaccine: thrombosis in combination with a low platelet count. In younger people, who are now up for their vaccination, the risk of a serious course of disease is lower - so the risk of the side effects, which incidentally also seem to occur more frequently in younger people, is more serious.

At Pfizer and Moderna, therefore, the ""benefit-to-risk ratio"" is more favorable for this group, according to the Health Council. ""It is preferable to use these mRNA vaccines in younger groups who are going to be invited for the first shot."" So that would mean that Janssen and AstraZeneca would be virtually eliminated from use. Bart-Jan Kullberg, chairman of the Health Council, says it doesn't necessarily mean that AstraZeneca and Janssen will be ""banned"" or that they are not good vaccines, but ""we now have the luxury of choosing the safest route.

An exception
The Health Council does make an exception: ""Groups that are difficult to reach via regular channels for the second shot may actually benefit more from the Janssen vaccine because they are then protected with just one shot."" The Health Council emphasizes that the Janssen vaccine is effective and safe; despite the very rare side effects, the benefit outweighs the minor risks.

The advice for AstraZeneca remains: only use it for people over the age of 60. In addition, AstraZeneca is only used for people who receive the second shot with this vaccine, and according to the Health Council this is fine to continue. The number of reports of adverse events after the second shot with AstraZeneca is considerably lower than after the first shot; moreover, only one shot offers insufficient protection.

No more invitations with AstraZeneca or Janssen
In practice, this means that AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines will remain on the shelf: after all, a large proportion of people over 60 have already been vaccinated at least once.

Adopting this advice could cause some delay in vaccination planning, as it would again somewhat confuse Hugo de Jonge's carefully sorted puzzle pieces. But, the Health Council believes, due to the now ample availability of Pfizer and Moderna, this need not be an insurmountable problem: ""The results of the modeling show that hardly any effect is to be expected on the number of infections, hospitalizations and mortality if only mRNA vaccines are used for the current phase of the vaccination program.""

The outgoing cabinet is adopting the advice of the Health Council. Everyone born in 1982 and later years will now only be offered the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, Minister Hugo de Jonge announced.

An important reason for this new recommendation is that the Janssen vaccine can also cause serious thrombosis in combination with a low platelet count as a side effect. This has been established abroad; there have been no reports (yet) in the Netherlands.

According to the Board, the data available to date show that ""the number of reports after vaccination with Janssen in certain age groups is in the same order of magnitude as after vaccination with AstraZeneca, with more reports in younger age groups"".

'Tricky advice'
The minister considers it a ""difficult advice"" from the Health Council. He emphasizes that people from 1982 and subsequent years can opt for the Janssen vaccine, for example if it is more convenient with a planned vacation. He also wants to investigate whether there is a possibility to use the Janssen vaccine for certain groups such as seafarers, military personnel on mission or the homeless.

The Health Council also writes in its advice that groups that are difficult to reach for a second vaccination, such as the homeless, would benefit more from the Janssen vaccine than from Pfizer or Moderna, because only a single dose of Janssen is needed.

New phase
The Health Council has looked at whether restricting the use of Janssen will cause delays. This would only be a week according to RIVM models, ""but ultimately you make a profit because you vaccinate more people with vaccines that are more effective,"" says chairman Bart-Jan Kullberg. Also, little effect is to be expected on the number of infections, hospitalizations and deaths due to covid-19 if only Pfizer and Moderna are used

There are enough other vaccines available and at this stage of the vaccination program the Netherlands can afford to use only mRNA vaccines, the advice says.

Figures published earlier by the RIVM and the Ministry of Health show that the Netherlands has ordered enough vaccines from Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna to implement the Health Council's advice.

With the current stock and expected deliveries, some 6.5 million doses of the two vaccines have been delivered by the end of June. There are still about 5 million people aged 18 to 40 waiting for their first shot. So it seems that the advice can be implemented without much delay.

167,000 Janssen appointments
There are now 167,000 Janssen vaccinations scheduled, according to GGD GHOR Nederland. It concerns people from the birth years 1967, 1968 and 1976. These are people who are 44, 45, 52, 53 and 54 years old.

According to a Municipal Health Department spokesperson, it is not yet clear whether these people will be offered an alternative or whether they will still receive the Janssen vaccine.

AstraZeneca unchanged
The Health Council has also looked at the age limit previously set for AstraZeneca. The council recommends that the 60-year age limit be retained, because there is hardly any health benefit from lowering the age limit to 50 years according to RIVM models.

This could change if new insights emerge about the very rare side effect of thrombosis in combination with a low platelet count.

People who have had an initial AstraZeneca shot will also receive a second dose of the vaccine, regardless of their age. According to the council, it is not yet certain whether administering Pfizer or Moderna as a second dose is sufficiently effective and safe.

Younger groups of people who have not yet received a Covid-19 vaccine should not be given the Janssen Vaccine, a single-shot product that currently requires no booster. Instead, they should be given one of the approved mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna, the Dutch Health Council wrote in emergency advice to Health Minister Hugo de Jonge on Wednesday.

If De Jonge accepts the advice, the Council believe it will cost a one-week setback to the Dutch vaccination program.

The vaccines ""are more effective and have fewer drawbacks"" than the viral vector vaccines from both AstraZeneca, and Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiary Janssen, the Council stated. Both of the vector vaccines have been linked to a serious side effect involving blood clots in combination with a low platelet count. Research center Lareb has not learned of a single case of the specific side effect occurring after the Janssen Vaccine was administered in the Netherlands, though it has been found internationally.

Using all available international data, the Council said that thrombosis with a low platelet count has been diagnosed with roughly the same rate as after vaccination with AstraZeneca ""with more reports in younger age groups.""

The Council issued its new policy advisory because the mRNA vaccines are being produced and delivered to the Netherlands in higher quantities, and also because the current level of coronavirus infections in the country is relatively low. Those two reasons mean, ""the Netherlands can afford this choice in the vaccination program,"" the Council stated.

The last group of people to be offered the Janssen Vaccine are those born in 1976. Some groups that cannot easily be contacted for a second vaccine shot, like homeless people, will still get the Janssen vaccine.

The Council did not change its advice about the AstraZeneca vaccine, saying it should only be used for people over 60 years of age because the scientific data has not changed. The Health Ministry this week said it would allow people who refused the AstraZeneca vaccine to instead get inoculated with one of the mRNA vaccines instead.",,,1622633443,{},h0avstl,False,t3_nqjcbt,False,False,t3_nqjcbt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nqjcbt/netherlands_told_to_limit_use_of_janssen_covid/h0avstl/,1622736630,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

""The incidence of myocarditis is approximately 1.5 million cases worldwide per year. Incidence is usually estimated between 10 to 20 cases per 100,000 persons. The overall incidence is unknown and probably underdiagnosed.  In the United States, the frequency of myocarditis is difficult to ascertain as many cases are subclinical. In community-based populations, the prevalence and outcomes of myocarditis are unknown as epidemiologic studies suggest that the majority of Coxsackie B virus infections, an important cause of myocarditis are subclinical, thus following a benign course. According to some estimates, 1% to 5% of all patients with acute viral infections may involve the myocardium. The majority of patients are young and healthy. Individuals who are susceptible include children, pregnant women and those who are immunocompromised. ""

So incidence is normally between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 20,000 in the total population.  It also states that overall incidence is unknown and probably undiagnosed, so potentially higher.  It also states that the majority of patients are young and healthy.  If the total population incidence is 1 in 10,000 and you focus on a young and healthy segment of the population then would it be that surprising to find an incidence of 1 in 6,000 among that group?

PARIS ‚Äì The Pfizer vaccine is slightly less effective but appears to still protect against the more transmissible Indian strain of the virus that causes COVID-19, according to a study by France‚Äôs Pasteur Institute.

‚ÄúDespite slightly diminished efficacy, the Pfizer vaccine probably protects‚Äù against the Indian variant, according to laboratory test results, said Olivier Schwartz, the institute‚Äôs director and co-author of the study that was published on the BioRxiv website ahead of peer review.

The study sampled 28 health care workers in the city of Orleans. Sixteen of them had received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, while 12 had received one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

The Indian variant seems to have the lowest efficacy from Pfizer. No one has established an exact number in live populations but it‚Äôs noticeably less than with other variants in lab studies.

What I am saying is, the risks that are present when taking these vaccines *are made evident* during Stage III clinical trials, prior to the EUA issuance. So we knew almost all the risks prior to the issuance of the EUA.I am not saying side effects will never occur. What I am saying is that the serious ones will occur at such an insanely low rate we shouldn't even think twice about taking them barring medical contraindications.

I am not a physician, so I will not sit here and try to pretend I am an expert in the medicine. However, I do understand statistics. 

""Over 285 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from December 14, 2020, through May 24, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 4,863 reports of death (0.0017%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. CDC and FDA physicians review each case report of death as soon as notified and CDC requests medical records to further assess reports. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines."" (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html)

Even if the vaccine killed all of those people (highly doubtful) It would still be leagues less than COVID's death toll. 

I further my argument by saying to you that if these vaccines were truly unsafe, we'd see higher cases of adverse events. In the US, 166.4 million residents have received one shot or more. So my question to you is, if these vaccines are truly risky, or unsafe:

Clerici to Adnkronos: ""On the beach after 10-20 seconds he's done for""

""We have shown that UVA and UVB rays from the sun completely kill Sars-Cov-2 within a few tens of seconds"". This was stated by Mario Clerici, professor of General Pathology at the State University of Milan and scientific director of the Irccs of Milan Don Gnocchi Foundation, author, together with the research group of the National Institute of Astrophysics, of an all-Italian study published today in preprint .

""This study - explains Clerici to Adnkronos Salute - is essentially the continuation of a previous work we did last year when we saw that UVC rays, which are a component of the sun's rays that do not reach the earth, killed Sars. -Cov-2 after a few seconds exposure. But the Uvc - Clerici reiterates - do not arrive on earth, so those data were important only from a certain point of view. Now, we have seen that also the Uva and Uvb which are the rays that reach the earth, tan and heat us, in a matter of tens of seconds they completely kill Sars-Cov-2. So - he emphasizes - we have exactly replicated the data on UVCs, however, this time demonstrating that all solar rays destroy the virus. And among other things - adds the immunologist - the time needed, for example when you are on the beach with the sun that is amplified by the glare on the sand or on the water, is even shorter. to Clerici - 10-20 seconds of Uva and Uvb are really enough to completely kill the virus "".

""Our idea - explains the researcher - is that this, together with the ever higher percentage of vaccinated people, explains why we are overcoming the problem with the warm season"". So why did an avalanche of infections occur in Brazil during the summer, as well as in India? ""First of all it must be said that the sun - underlines Clerici - is not the only element that justifies everything we observe. In India, religious festivals contributed with bathing in the Ganges and then there were monsoons, so there is it was all the haze of the sun's rays due to the clouds. In Brazil we all know what happened - adds the immunologist - unfortunately they paid for the Bolsonaro management, because it is true that the sun's rays are needed but also masks, vaccines and everything the rest"".

In any case, the experiments confirmed the effectiveness of the sun against Covid-19. ""You can see in a visualization - says the immunologist - the effect of the sun's rays on the virus: if you don't expose it to the sun's rays the virus infects the cells, if you expose it to the sun you kill it"".

A discovery that could have excellent applications in everyday life to sterilize objects and environments from the virus. ""Last year's data were important because they led to the development of devices that performed precisely this function but Uvc rays - recalls the scientist - are dangerous for the human skin, so you could not stay in the same room where they were applied. Uvb rays instead no, they are the rays that normally touch us when we go out in the sun, so this discovery has a much higher importance "". In short, if we put normal solar lamps in the buses could we solve a problem? ""Yes. Apart from the fact that we will all come out more tanned and more beautiful, what these data suggest is just that.

""But let's see how the experimental demonstration of this discovery came about. ""

The astrophysicists connected a machine that produces the different solar rays in a distinct way, so only grapes or UVBs or UVCs rather than ultraviolet - explains Clerici - then we put the machine under a hood, we took the lung cells and we threw on the virus. And the virus that has been exposed or not to the different components of the sun's rays. At first - explains the immunologist - we used a maximal dose of virus, therefore much much higher than that of a subject with Covid. And then we used the dose present in a patient with severe Covid, to see if it could also have potential clinical importance. And indeed it is: in a few seconds the amount of virus is inactivated, which is what in patients causes severe Covid "".",,,1622660100,{},h0chzoq,True,t3_nqt9wy,False,True,t3_nqt9wy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nqt9wy/covid_italian_study_this_is_how_the_sun_destroys/h0chzoq/,1622776030,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You have probably millions of flu patients each day in a country of billions of people. All of them having typical flu symptoms. Can the doctors tell on the first sight who contracted which strain? No, because they all have similar symptom. So each patient will get treatment and the doctor will keep observing and diagnosing. It'll only when after the patient shows abnormality that would trigger a epidemiology alert. At this point still nothing can be determined as no one knows if what a new strains symptoms would look like Now 1 to 2 weeks have past. Then they will need to send the sample to the institution that has the capability to do a genome sequencing.

Unvaxxed people catching it - while some might end up in the ICU, the 65+ population has really amazing vaccination numbers so we wouldnt see anything like ICUs getting overran

From vaccine data Israel is saying up to 1 in 3000 or 30 per 100k however this stood out to me: https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/06/israel-reports-link-between-rare-cases-heart-inflammation-and-covid-19-vaccination

""But the rate of myocarditis following vaccination among young men was higher. Ninety percent of the cases picked up in Israel appeared in men, and although myocarditis is normally more common among young men, the rate among those vaccinated was somewhere between five and 25 times the background rate, the report says.""


5-25x background rate is a big variation and its really vague without specific numbers. What is the background rate they're actually assuming?

Good COVID Myocarditis data is just coming out and seems focused on athletes - which I guess is fine if we're talking young men, but would love to see better data: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2780548

""In this cohort study of 1597 US competitive collegiate athletes undergoing comprehensive cardiovascular testing, the prevalence of clinical myocarditis based on a symptom-based screening strategy was only 0.31%.""

The implied Covid-induced myocarditis rate here is 300 per 100k.

Antibodies induced by vaccines are less effective against the variants because the variants have changes in spike protein where the antibodies bind. But the vaccines still protect agains moderate to severe disease. That is what we want! T cell epitopes are not changed in the variants.

Why don‚Äôt they stand behind the promised safety of their product and project confidence to the vaccine hesitant by stripping themselves of their immunity?

Some people don‚Äôt want the jab because they have heard of people who get sick shortly after injection and have to stay home from work.  They can‚Äôt afford to take time off work, so they decide they can‚Äôt afford to get vaccinated.

We should be mindful that their vaccination rate, partial and fully, are pretty close to the US's. Sequencing shows the same variant and P.1, another variant of concern out of Brazil, is on the rise in the US but have not reached the inflection point to reverse our tend yet.

https://outbreak.info/location-reports?loc=USA

If we let our guard down with these more contagious variants with so many partially and unvaccinated among the vaccinated we risk creating variants will even more immune escape. Evolutionary pressure works against us more quickly with the more transmission we allow. I hope we learn that strong and early mitigation measures pay dividends later during this critical time.

But, like, can we just be honest, there is a very large portion of vacations that are destructive to the environment. Cruise ships aren't uniquely damaging in that regard.

Air travel, which I imagine the majority of people upvoting your comment engage in, is right in the same ballpark as cruising.

A [one way international flight](https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Carbonoffset/Pages/default.aspx?force_isolation=true) can make up almost the entire carbon emissions [of the average person's cruise](https://www.tourismdashboard.org/explore-the-data/cruise-ship/?force_isolation=true#:~:text=A%20total%20carbon%20footprint%20for,dioxide%2Dequivalent%20for%20their%20cruise.)

Yes, the labor situation on cruise ships is definitely worse than many other common vacations, but from an environmental perspective, cruise ships aren't really far and away from everything else because of just how destructive flying is.

So let's make the assumption that on average vaccinated people are 90% protected - a bit less than the 95% full dose protection level to account for partially vaccinated people. With half the population in each bucket, you'd expect to see 10 times as many unvaccinated cases as vaccinated, or 1/11 of the total cases to be among vaccinated people.

At 20,000 cases per day, that is about 1800 vaccinated cases per day, or ~634,000 vaccinated cases over a year, should case levels stay where they are now. With half the 332 million people in this unvaccinated population, this amounts to an annualized risk of 0.4% (1 in 250) of having a case of covid. At 10,000 cases, it's an annualized risk of 0.2% (1 in 500).

Of late, as a result of mass vaccination, lagged case fatality rate has fallen to around 1%. So in our vaccinated group, that's an annualized risk of 0.004% (1 in 25,000) of dying from covid, falling to 0.002% once cases fall to 10,000 per day. If that risk were applied to the entire US population (not just vaccinated), it would mean ~13,000 deaths at current case rates (less than flu), falling to 6500 deaths with cases cut in half.

The bit about masks just isn't true, but it's certainly area-specific. I'm up in Northumberland and by my estimate, nearly everyone is wearing masks when in shops (and I'd bet good money that the ones not wearing them are the same Muppets that never have) but when I was last in Bradford I was pretty shocked to see that very few were wearing them in the supermarket. Tbh, I'd observed this in Bradford last summer when they were a peak hotspot too. I'm sure it's no coincidence that the two areas have dramatically different rates of infection...

The third wave is an interesting point though - the big question is whether enough people are vaccinated now such that a third wave will have very little impact. Clearly, we're on a race against time to get the rest of the population vaccinated and the big worry now is the unprotected, younger adult population that may be more blas√© about Covid, not realising that it's still a bloody horrible thing to get. It will be very tight timing over the next three months to get this group vaccinated (and get second doses into the rest of the population) before the next wave takes hold.

We can agree to disagree on this. Not every year of your life has the same quality. Let's face it: if you live to be 80, then you don't have a lot of independence for your first 18 years, you're probably broke (or definitely not in the position to splurge on things) between 18-25, and those last 10 years, between 70-80, your health degrades and you're definitely not as spry and active as when you were 30. (Yes, yes, I know there are some active and happy 100-year-olds. They're not the norm, though.)

That leaves you with ages 25-70 - and really, I suspect your health and quality of life goes down well below you turn 70. That's just 45 good years. The pandemic and various restrictions have been going on since March 2020, so call it 15 months. (Here in Ontario, things are still very much locked down.) That's a **huge** fraction of your enjoyable lifespan. If you assume that your hands-down best years are between 25-50, then you've just lost more than one of those years.

However, 100% being a suspicious number, I looked into it a bit more, and the source for that data seems to be [here](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/covid-19-vaccination-in-scotland/resource/9b99e278-b8d8-47df-8d7a-a8cf98519ac1). This states that the population used is the '2019 mid-year estimate' for Scotland (which is presumably the most recent official population estimate). Since the population is growing slightly, and aging, it's likely these age groups actually have a couple percent more people in them, so the uptake percents are more like 97 or 98%, not 100%. Still amazing.

Data for England is [here](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-vaccinations/), and is similarly excellent. Again with the (slightly out of date ) 2019 population estimate, it shows the following uptake percentages as of last week:

|80+|95%|
|:-|:-|
|75-79|100%|
|70-74|97%|

|55-59|96%|
|50-54|90%|
|45-49|82%|
|40-44|82%|

Likely, the lower few age groups will  continue climbing a bit over the couple weeks after this release, as not everybody would have instantly gotten a vaccine once eligible. (for instance, compared to the previous week, the 40-44 age group had increased by 5%, and 45-49 by 2%)

After months of relative safety, Taiwan is battling a spike in community infections, placing curbs on gatherings and ordering entertainment venues closed, while urging people to stay at home as much as possible.

Announcing 549 new infections, including 177 added to recent days' tallies in reflection of delays in reporting positive tests, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said the trend was stable, although it was not falling.

Cases rose rapidly in the past 24 hours in the capital, Taipei, and a neighbouring city, where infections are heavily concentrated, he added.

""It looks like it's not falling, and is sometimes still going up,"" Chen said. ""As much as possible don't go out and wear a mask.""

Wednesday's infections were up from Tuesday's figure of 327 domestic cases.

The economic ministry set limits on the numbers of visitors to wet markets, amid concerns that the shops of food and vegetable vendors could become virus hot spots.

Taiwan has vaccinated just about 3% of its 23.5 million people, but has millions of shots on order and has begun preparing for a mass vaccination programme.

Chen said he did not know which further vaccines might arrive before the end of the month, but warned a global supply shortage could be a concern.

Authorities plan eventually to be able to vaccinate up to 1.7 million people a week, and are working to build a simple booking system with lots of vaccination sites, said Chuang Jen-hsiang, an official of the Taiwan Centres for Disease Control.

So far, Taiwan has received only the Moderna Inc¬†(MRNA.O)¬†and AstraZeneca Plc¬†(AZN.L)¬†vaccines. It has blamed China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, for blocking a deal for BioNTech SE¬†(22UAy.DE)¬†doses. Beijing denies the charges.

&gt;Vaccine efficacy is generally reported as a relative risk reduction (RRR). It uses the relative risk (RR)‚Äîie, the ratio of attack rates with and without a vaccine‚Äîwhich is expressed as 1‚ÄìRR.

Although the RRR considers only participants who could benefit from the vaccine, the absolute risk reduction (ARR), which is the difference between attack rates with and without a vaccine, considers the whole population. ARRs tend to be ignored because they give a much less impressive effect size than RRRs: 1¬∑3% for the AstraZeneca‚ÄìOxford, 1¬∑2% for the Moderna‚ÄìNIH, 1¬∑2% for the J&amp;J, 0¬∑93% for the Gamaleya, and 0¬∑84% for the Pfizer‚ÄìBioNTech vaccines.",,,1622655937,{},h0c7wzm,False,t3_nqa46x,False,True,t1_h0bdnoi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nqa46x/80_of_cruise_enthusiasts_would_prefer_to_sail/h0c7wzm/,1622769709,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Why did you choose to use the fully vaccinated rate when discussing a potential fall/winter surge?

Shouldn't we just be using the single dose number and even that's going to undersell the vaccinated rate come September or October?

Yeah, 45% vaccinated with natural immunity on top of that and having higher rates across the country is going to make it basically impossible for a ""big surge"" (given the language used above, we're talking about an equivalent to 2020/2021's fall/winter surge, not just the July 2020 surge).  Mississippi will run out of bodies before they ever hit another 2000 cases per day figure. 

People like to act like these southern states are completely isolated and the only infection/interaction is among themselves, but look at influenza numbers.  They were basically nothing even in places that didn't do anything.  Why?  Because our communities are very connected.

The highly vaccinated northern states won't be seeding in cases.  And when they go on vacations and visit restaurants and bars, they're going to crowd out the opportunities for the virus to spread.

GOF with certain viruses can be a problem.

First your institution, then the NSABB (a US committee that looks at such research) to make sure the benefits outweigh the risks.

Right now most hotspots are under lockdown, which is the likely reason for the sharp decline, I hope cases don't rise with the unlock, but they can. 

Let's put the number of cases aside for a moment, there are people like me and my family which are staying inside our home for over 14 months now, even when daily cases were way less than they are right now. That's not gonna change for us until 70-80% of the population is fully vaccinated. And I've been following the vaccination policies of India for the last 6-7 months, the government here fucked up real hard, and there are very less chances that we'll achieve good vaccine coverage anytime soon, it'll likely take one year. 

Yes, I've read this too that vaccine hesitancy in India is lower, but some people are trying their best to change that. There's this fraud named ""Baba Ramdev"" which has a massive following, claiming shit about vaccines and allopathy in general. He claimed without any source that 1000 doctors died after vaccination (this claim is bullshit btw), and that only yoga and ayurveda will save India. He's doing that to promote his ""coronil"" which he advertises as a sure shot way to fight corona (That too is bullshit). His company was loosing the profit margins he had, and if all people are vaccinated he won't be able to promote coronil.

I was just watching something about the Challenger and Columbia disasters. Both of those had elements that could have or should have been researched and fixed because they should have been foreseen. The thing that haunted me as a kid when the Challenger happened, was that they survived all the way down to the ground. They had several minutes to think about their imminent death. It would have been a mercy to die quickly. I think with Columbia that happened sooner because of the heat of reentry, but I still think about how that must have felt.

The same is true of this pandemic. Those of us with critical thinking skills understood immediately that the asymptomatic spread was the real problem with this disease, and we understood that it was likely to spread at least to some degree via aerosols (I read a study on that in April or May of 2020). So the masking need became obvious to us, but seemed to elude many others. I remember thinking about this as having pandemic potential back when I first heard of it in January 2020 (which now feels like 20 years ago).

It might be that the anti maskers and COVID deniers would have existed anyway. But their ilk were fueled by politicians whose self centeredness was so egregious that they had the audacity to believe that a pandemic affecting the entire world was cooked up just to take them down. Add to that social media which gives the people with the loudest and worst opinions an outsized  platform to spew their terrible ideas and a probably well meaning but ignorant populace and you have a recipe for disaster.

I'm not sure if people got dumber, or I just gave them too much credit in the past. Probably a mix of both.

Transmission is the movement of a virus from one host to another. We measure it by reproductive index, the number of people infected on average by an infected person. For SARS-CoV-2 it is 2-3 and that has not changed for any variant, in my opinion. Fitness is the ability of a virus to reproduce in a host population. Fitness can be influenced by many factors, including ability to evade innate or antibody responses, particle stability, mutational robustness, and even transmission. But what likely is affecting the fitness of SARS-CoV-2 variants is evasion of antibody against spike. The experiments to understand why the variants are more fit have not been done.

T cell epitopes do change in an individual, but they do not transmit to another person and do not move through a population. The reason is that the cell surface receptors that display the T cell peptides are different in everyone.

Although there is no hard evidence, anyone with a bit of knowledge on the tactics usually employed by the CCP to rope other countries into China's way of doing things, would see some credibility to the truth of this report.

In short, China has likely been actively severing talks between Taiwan and other vaccine suppliers, and leaving just one channel open for Taiwan to take the bait.  

Next thing you see if Taiwan takes the bait?  China will accuse Taiwan of being an ingrate when there are further conflicts.

Yeah eventually Taiwan may end up having no choice but to take China's offer.  I just want to highlight the glaring hypocrisy from China here.  (But what's new anyway?
