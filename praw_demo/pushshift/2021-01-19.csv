Phase 3 trials measure real world efficacy through a predefined end point. [From the FDA approval briefing report](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download):

&gt;Efficacy is being assessed throughout a participant’s follow-up in the study through surveillance for potential cases of COVID-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;If, at any time, a participant develops acute respiratory illness, an illness visit occurs.  
&gt;  
&gt;Assessments for illness visits include a nasal (midturbinate) swab, which is tested at a central laboratory using a reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test (e.g., Cepheid; FDA authorized under EUA), or other sufficiently validated nucleic acid amplification-based test (NAAT), to detect SARS-CoV-2.  
&gt;  
&gt;The central laboratory NAAT result is used for the case definition, unless it is not possible to test the sample at the central laboratory.

The Phase 3 Pfizer trial measured acute respiratory illness with a positive NAAT nasal swab as the primary endpoint, basically did people go on to develop symptomatic detectable infection (NAAT is similar to PCR testing). What was found is that 95% of symptomatic detectable infections occurred in people given the placebo in the study.

This is where the position that we don't know if the vaccine prevents transmission comes from. It is possible that you can still be infected and spread the virus without developing symptoms as that is not something that was measured in the Pfizer trial, they did not test asymptomatic participants as part of their follow-up.

Words like immunity and efficacy are used frequently but when examining scientific evidence it is important to understand what was actually being measured, especially when we are discussing a single piece of evidence.

If you have a high level of antibodies it is likely that you have developed a significant level of immunity but we can't really say that for sure until we actually measure if it has any effect in the real world, this is the importance of phase 3 trials.",,,1611113242,{},gjwnuff,False,t3_l0ioba,False,False,t1_gjvgeho,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l0ioba/israeli_hospital_98_of_staff_who_got_2nd_shot/gjwnuff/,1611240131,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I think the main point everyone seems to be missing is that the more it spreads, the more it mutates. The current vaccines have been showing positive results against the mutations, but.. the more it spreads, the more it mutates. Our job, as humans, is to decrease spread and lower mutations. It’s not that hard- but all news of mutations should also carry that message. Less spread= Less mutations. Because we really do t know how much worse/ better the next mutation will be. It’s not some thought out plan, it’s just a process of reproducing a virus over and over again with some flaws in reproduction that make that version of the virus more successful or less (the viruses job is to reproduce). Slow spread, slow reproduction, slow mutations, kill the virus... 


The more mutations, the less any prior immunity works. It’s why we get flu shots every year- to stay ahead of mutations. A more deadly, more contagious virus, we can’t stay ahead of. I really feel that public health hasn’t made this clear- there is no ‘herd immunity’ when you have a rapidly spreading, mutating, virus. Every person/ and animal/ that gets it becomes an opportunity for the virus to mutate.

[],,TheHomosapienAgenda,,,[],,,,text,t2_y3mmb,False,False,[],"The discovery of several new variants of the coronavirus that may spread more easily, including a mutation that took hold in the Bay Area in December, makes it even more urgent to fix the nation’s troubled vaccination rollout — before the evolving virus causes another surge or learns to evade vaccines.

Throughout the yearlong pandemic, public health experts have advised that beating the virus was a marathon, that it would take many months of commitment to social distancing measures to win. That’s still true. But in many ways the race has intensified in recent weeks: between a virus that is spinning out new mutations that could make it harder to contain and an immunization campaign marked by repeated fumbles.

“We’re really in a race now,” said Dr. Charles Chiu, the UCSF virologist who identified the L452R variant that’s blown up in parts of the Bay Area over the past month. “This only increases our urgency to mass vaccinate the population before additional variants evolve and emerge.”

One worrisome aspect: The more the coronavirus is circulating in the community, the more chances it has to mutate and develop into new variants. And there has never been more virus in California and the United States than now — and many other countries are also struggling to contain it, creating more risk in an interconnected world.

“By letting the virus run rampant, we are allowing it to accumulate a lot of mutations. And some of those may be advantageous for the virus,” said Dr. Catherine Blish, an infectious disease expert at Stanford. “The best thing we can do right now is deliver the vaccine as quickly as possible to as many people as possible to decrease that total infection burden, so we are accumulating fewer mutations.

“We can’t stop the virus from mutating,” she said. “But we really can gain the upper hand here.”

The U.S., and California specifically, is in a precarious spot in the pandemic. The country passed 400,000 total deaths from COVID-19 on Tuesday, and in California, daily cases and deaths have been overwhelmingly high for weeks.

Meanwhile, the immunization campaign that the country needs to escape the pandemic has been littered with problems, both at the state and national level — most recently with 330,000 Moderna doses being taken out of circulation in California due to concerns over allergic reactions.

A new variant, or more than one, has the potential to make a bad situation worse. If a more infectious version of the virus takes over, it could reinvigorate a surge that is just starting to level off. And it could potentially undermine immunization efforts if the vaccines are less effective against it.

The immediate threat to the Bay Area and the rest of the state from new variants isn’t yet clear. The highly infectious B117 variant that’s spreading widely in the United Kingdom has been identified in Southern California, but only in a few dozen cases. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned last week that the variant could become the dominant version of the virus in the U.S. as soon as March, and that it could fuel a massive new surge in cases.

The L452R variant, whose presence in California was announced Sunday, appears to have a foothold in parts of the state and has been tied to multiple large outbreaks in Santa Clara County, but scientists don’t know for sure that it’s more infectious than the virus type that has circulated in California to date. If L452R turns out to be more infectious, it’s unclear how the competition between it and the B117 variant would play out.

The B117 variant is not able to evade vaccines, but scientists don’t know about the L452R variant. Neither appears to cause more serious illness — though a more infectious virus would inevitably cause more sickness and death.

The emergence of the two new variants in California, along with at least two more spreading in other parts of the world, raises fresh concerns about what mutations could still come along or may already be here and simply haven’t been detected yet. Experts say the arrival of these variants makes it clearer than ever that the pandemic must be contained quickly.

“With 3,000 or 4,000 people a day dying (in the United States) we were already in a race with the virus that we knew, and now we’re going to add another element,” said Dr. Robert Wachter, chair of the Department of Medicine at UCSF. “It’s like you’re in a race and all of a sudden the person you’re racing against is 50% faster.

“Once we had two amazingly effective and safe vaccines, it really was how fast can you get this into people’s arms,” he said. “Not only because of the threats that were obviously quite clear, but the emerging threats that will come out the longer this takes.”

The coronavirus, like all other so-called RNA viruses, mutates regularly. But the COVID-19 virus tends to mutate at a slower pace than many other viruses, adopting only one or two mutations a month. Most of those mutations have little or no effect. Some make the virus less likely to survive. Other mutations make it slightly more or less infectious. Or they change the way the virus interacts with the body’s immune system, making it a more challenging target for natural immunity or a vaccine.

When enough mutations build up, a new variant emerges that is genetically separate from its parent and behaves in a notably different way. The B117 variant has 23 mutations and is much more infectious than its parent. Another variant found in South Africa also appears to spread more easily.

The L452R variant has five mutations. Infectious disease experts worry that it may also be more infectious, if only because of how quickly it’s taken hold in the region and other parts of the state. But they don’t yet know how those mutations affect its behavior.

That so many variants have been detected in such short order raises another overarching concern: This coronavirus is mutating faster than most scientists thought it would. That’s likely due in part to simple math — there is so much virus circulating around the world right now that even at a slow mutation rate, the alterations are going to pile up.

Public health experts say that for now, there’s no evidence that the new variants aren’t susceptible to the vaccines. But laboratory tests suggest that some variants, including L452R, have a mutation that may make the vaccines less effective. Much more research needs to be done, Chiu and others said.

The good news is that the vaccines being used now can be easily modified to match a new variant, infectious disease experts said. That’s not an ideal situation, though — it would certainly complicate an already chaotic vaccination campaign. And it would require a much more aggressive surveillance effort to identify new variants and determine how well the vaccines work against them.

The possibility of a variant evading the vaccines could become more pronounced as more people are immunized, infectious disease experts say. Vaccinating people puts pressure on the virus to mutate for its survival. Random mutations that let the virus escape the vaccine will be favored — and more likely to replicate.

“If you have a circulating virus that now encounters immune control (from a vaccine), you will with much higher likelihood help evolve variants that will be adapted and will grow better,” said Dr. Melanie Ott, director of the Gladstone Institute of Virology, an independent research group in San Francisco.

That also means that a clumsy vaccination program that leaves large gaps in protection could make it more likely for a variant to emerge that can evade the vaccines, she said. Much of the world has yet to access the vaccines, so even if the United States tamed the virus, it would need to be vigilant about the virus arriving across borders.

Until herd immunity is attained and the virus stops circulating, variants will remain an issue.

“If we are too slow, we will have potentially variants take over that may be less susceptible to the vaccine. We will have a situation where the vaccine is partially inactive,” Ott said. “We need to get as many people vaccinated as quickly we can, so we have as little virus circulating as possible.”",,,1611130326,{},gjxbo0l,False,t3_l13o60,False,False,t1_gjx8yxq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l13o60/can_vaccines_keep_up_with_coronavirus_mutations/gjxbo0l/,1611256354,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

What's still unknown is how effectively people who are vaccinated transmit to each other.  Note that the vaccine is potentially ""working"" at both ends of the transmission to both reduce the viral load of someone who does get infected, and make a particular viral dose be less virulent even if you do get infected.  But the 95% number only applies to symptoms (not viral load, though there is a high correlation), and isn't directly applicable.

These are things like diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, etc.

So when someone dies ""with"" Covid how do they decide Covid is the cause of death? I think this is a good question. I think it is in part a judgement call by the doctor or hospital. But in some cases they might not know if the person had these conditions.

The best explanation I have heard is based around life expectancy. Like they know that the average 80 year old person with certain health conditions is expected to live say 5 more years. If they get Covid and die they determine that it is Covid that cut their life short.

Every year, about 150-million Americans get the flu vaccine in under 6-months.  That's a pace of about 1.2-million people per day, with a totally normal, already-in-place vaccine distribution infrastructure. 

The factors that are limiting distribution right now are: 

* Prioritization Rules &amp; Restrictions
* Cold Handling Requirements
* Limitations on Providers Who Can Obtain and Administer the Vaccine

Obviously over all of this are limitations on vaccine production.  But, assuming that J&amp;J is approved and the manufacturers meet their targets, we'll have enough vaccine available to vaccinate all the adults in the country by the end of June.  More if the AZ vaccine is approved here as well. 

So, that solves availability and improves the cold handling requirements.  I expect is also helps to ease the restrictions around prioritization and provider availability.  

And, of course, the standard flu vaccine season doesn't include things like mass vaccination events in stadiums etc. 

Barring serious unexpected failures, I think it's pretty likely and achievable to have the entire adult population who wants to get vaccinated by early-summer 2021.

As iodine frees the body from toxins, the body is in repair or healing mode and as such, is in greater need of vital nutrients. These nutrients are active B vitamins, zinc, iron, potassium, vitamin C, selenium and magnesium. Did you supplement as needed for these? What about the iodine dose, did you ever reach 50mg?

When I say they behave as though it won’t work, I obviously do not mean they literally convince themselves it’s doomed to fail. Obviously they would not continue on in that case.

That is the reason that we don’t give the vaccine to groups not included in the study, for instance, despite the fact that it is likely safe to do so for at least some of them. We assume it isn’t.

I think what you are referencing as a possible danger is called antibody dependent enhancement, where the antibodies actually help the infection instead of hindering it...but if that is a widespread problem then the mRNA vaccines are an issue because they induce the IgG antibodies.  In regards to the study you posted:  Most likely what we are seeing with the high IgG antibodies in these infected patients is a result of the severity of the infection, not a cause of it.  The more severe the infection, the more intense the immune response.

They found it, though in relatively few samples. But in the process, the scientists made another unwelcome discovery: California had produced a variant of its own.

That mutant, which belongs to a lineage known as CAL.20C, seemed to have popped up in July but lay low till November. Then it began to quickly spread.

CAL.20C accounted for more than half of the virus genome samples collected in Los Angeles laboratories on Jan. 13, according to a new study that has not yet been published.

“We had our own problem that didn’t cross over from Europe,” said Jasmine Plummer, a research scientist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, who worked on the new study. “It really originated here, and it had the chance to start to emerge and surge over the holiday.”

There’s no evidence that CAL.20C is more lethal than other variants. And scientists have to conduct more research to determine whether CAL.20C is in fact more contagious than other forms of the virus.

But Eric Vail, the director of molecular pathology at Cedars-Sinai, said it was possible that CAL.20C is playing a large part in the surge of cases that has overwhelmed Southern California’s hospitals. “I’m decently confident that this is a more infectious strain of the virus,” Dr. Vail said.

Dr. Charles Chiu, a virologist at the University of California, San Francisco, said that across the state, he and his colleagues are finding the variant in roughly 20 percent to 30 percent of samples being sequenced. “It just popped up under our noses, and now it’s rising in multiple counties,” he said. “On the whole, it’s safe to say it’s going to spread outside of California.”

Researchers are also looking in other states for CAL.20C, Dr. Plummer said, and have so far found it in Arizona, Connecticut, Maryland, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, as well as the District of Columbia. It’s not clear yet how common it is outside of California.

When Getting High Is a Hobby, Not a Habit
Last week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a formal warning about the variant swamping Britain. Although that mutant, called B.1.1.7, is still relatively rare in the United States, accounting for less than one-half percent of infections, the agency said it could be responsible for the majority of the nation’s cases by March.

An agency spokesman said that the C.D.C. is working with California to learn more about the new variant. “Currently, it’s not known whether this variant is any different from other SARS-CoV-2 viruses, whether those differences may have contributed to its emergence, or whether this emergence was merely a random event,” he said.

“I’ll say this particular variant is one to watch,” said Kristian Andersen, a virologist at Scripps Research Institute who discovered one of the first samples of B.1.1.7 in the United States. But he cautioned that it’s still unclear whether CAL.20C is getting more common because it has some biological advantage, or just by chance.

If both B.1.1.7 and CAL.20C are both more contagious that other variants, it’s not clear how a competition between the two of them will sort out. “CAL.20C has a big head start,” Dr. Vail said. “Even if B.1.1.7 is more infective overall, we may never see a big surge from it here in L.A.”

Ever since scientists first identified the new coronavirus a year ago in China, they’ve been tracking the emergence of new mutations, which arise at random and get passed down to new generations of viruses as they replicate in our bodies.

A new California variant may be driving the virus surge in the state, a study suggests.
Canadian officials say changes to Pfizer’s production schedule will not delay vaccinations.
N.Y.C. will run out of its current vaccine supply on Thursday, the mayor says. It’s not scheduled to get more until next week.
Many mutations are harmful to the virus and make it worse at replicating. Many others are neutral. But researchers have now discovered several that are worrisome because they seem to help the virus infect people more efficiently.

In the early months of the pandemic, a mutation arose in a lineage that then became dominant across much of the world. Known as D614G, the mutation is now believed to make the virus more easily transmitted from person to person, compared with variants without it.

In December, researchers in Britain found B.1.1.7, which is about 50 percent more transmissible than previous versions of the virus. The variant is a driving factor in the surge of cases and hospitalizations there now.

B.1.1.7 was in the United States in early November, according to a study posted online Tuesday by University of Arizona biologists Brendan Larsen and Michael Worobey. That would mean the variant had been circulating for two months before being detected.

In California, researchers looking for B.1.1.7 began noticing an unusual mutation in their samples. The mutation, called L452R, alters the shape of a protein, called spike, which decorates the surface of the coronavirus.

“We stumbled on this really unexpected finding and went with it from there,” Dr. Vail said.

The mutation has popped up in different viral lineages over the past year. Scientists have studied L452R because it might help coronaviruses stick to our cells and infect them.

In California, Dr. Vail, Dr. Plummer and their colleagues found that whenever they came across a variant with the L452 mutation, it also carried four other distinctive mutations. That combination, they said, indicated that they were dealing with a single lineage that had emerged at some point in California. The researchers named any virus carrying all five mutations CAL.20C.

The California Department of Health held a news conference Sunday night to announce that the L452 mutation was becoming more common in California. On Monday night, Cedars-Sinai issued a news release about its study, which will soon be posted on the preprint website MedRxiv.

The Cedars-Sinai team is part of a statewide network of researchers who have been tracking mutations in the coronavirus. They randomly selected nasal swabs from patients who tested positive for Covid-19, and then collected genetic material from the swabs.

The researchers pieced the fragments together to reconstruct the virus’s entire genome, and then looked for distinctive mutations. They then compared their own findings to other viral genomes sequenced across the state and country.

The researchers found the earliest sample of CAL.20C in July in Los Angeles. They couldn’t find another sample until October. The variant became more common in November, reaching 36 percent of the samples from Cedars-Sinai in December and 50 percent last week.

Outside scientists are concerned about the new findings, but say it’s still unclear whether the California variant’s mutations are giving it an edge — or whether it’s showing up so much just by chance.

There might be a bias in the samples that scientists are looking at, for example. It’s also possible that CAL.20C happened to become more common thanks to some big super-spreader events.

“I think we need to be careful before concluding that any particular lineage is spreading due to a transmission advantage rather than because it happened to ride a wave caused by human behaviors,” said Dr. Worobey.

If it does turn out to be more contagious, Dr. Plummer said, then CAL.20C may turn out to be partly responsible for the recent crippling surge of cases in Southern California’s hospitals.

As the total number of cases increased, Dr. Plummer and her colleague found, the percentage of CAL.20C also went up. That would be consistent with the idea that this is a more contagious variant. “I mean, the numbers speak for themselves,” she said.

Dr. Chiu also noted that the variant was involved in a number of outbreaks where large numbers of people got infected. “There are worrisome signs that this variant may be highly transmissible,” he said.

Dr. Chiu and his colleagues are now growing the variant in cells to see how quickly they multiply compared with other variants. The researchers are also going to observe how well antibodies produced by vaccines work against CAL.20C.

Other scientists are also looking more closely at the rise in frequency of the variant in California. They’re searching for evidence that could determine whether biology or chance is to blame for its rise.

“That’s the work that needs to be done,” said Dr. Vail. “We just don’t have that information.”",,,1611099671,{},gjvygu7,False,t3_l0vgqf,False,False,t3_l0vgqf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l0vgqf/new_california_variant_may_be_driving_virus_surge/gjvygu7/,1611225196,41,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In the *current* phase it's not by age - it's given to people in long term care facilities (like nursing homes), health care workers, first responders and so on.  The next phase which is supposed to start in February is when vaccines open up to everyone over the age of 75 or with 2 or more comorbidities.

&gt;expanding the pool to smokers

[That's a federal guideline from the CDC.](https://abc7.com/covid-19-vaccine-smokers-and-coronavirus-cdc/9719555/)  Multiple states are following it.  It's consider a comorbidity, and they will be eligible for the vaccine if they have another comorbidity starting next month.

&gt;and prisoners

Why shouldn't prisoners be considered for the vaccine?  Their lives aren't worth less than others.

&gt;I'm not positive, but I believe we're in the ten worst states of the country.

[Massachusetts ranks 33 out of 50](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/states-ranked-by-percentage-of-covid-19-vaccines-administered.html)

&gt;All because Charlie Baker refuses to ignore the CDC's advice

It's ironic because you're attacking him for following federal guidelines when it comes to considering smokers for the vaccine.

I work in medicine and keep hearing stories from friends working in the ER about patients under 30 with no other medical problems dying. I can think of 3 examples in the last 2 weeks. My husband was just asked about amputating a 21 year old otherwise healthy covid patient’s leg because the blood clots from covid killed his leg (they can’t amputate it because the operation would also kill him in his current condition, so if he survives he’ll get the amputation when he’s more stable. He probably won’t survive though). That’s just an anecdote but the point is many many healthy people are dying. 

The other side of this is the chain of transmission. If you get it and give it to just one person (though I’ve heard the average person infects 2-4 more people), and then that one person infects a few more people and so on, soon enough your infection led to 50 people getting infected. With a 2% mortality rate, that means you likely killed someone. 

The biggest factor in transmission is air circulation, you’re safer in a well ventilated place with high air turnover. It’s unlikely that your gym has better than average ventilation and people are breathing heavier if they’re doing anything worthwhile at a gym which means more virus in the air. The new variants infect people twice as fast, so they’re now saying 7 minutes is enough for an exposure instead of 15. That also means if you get it you’ll likely infect more people which gets you to one person killed by you being infected much faster even if the mortality is still 2%. I could go on but I’m sure you’re bored by now...

This is concerning. 

Of the half that showed immunity, those were people with lots of antibodies (severely ill/hospitalized patients).

Keep in mind that T-cell immunity also plays a role in immune defense and was not tested, so this is only half the picture. But as this variant spreads, the idea that a previous infection can protect well against future infections is fast becoming obsolete.

The vaccines should still be solid (maybe a few percent less effective against this new variant), but assuming this spreads, and it will, we can't get by with natural immunity for herd immunity anymore.

It may be helpful to remember that new variants are being recorded all the time, we have over 4,000 documented, it's just that media didn't used to pay attention to them because they are functionally the same, with two exceptions. You might recall that the D614G mutation got media attention around May and the ""mink mutation"" got media attention around September.

In December the UK reported a variant that might be functionally different (around 50% increase infectiousness), the public got interested, and the media realized they can get more clicks if they start to report every new variant and say ""it might be more infectious, antibodies might work less well against it"", etc. It always *might,* but empirically speaking only 2 out of the 4,000 variants have evidence of increased infectiousness, and only 1 had an effect on antibody performance (a minor one, and that variant is likely extinct) so the odds that any new variant is going to be a problem is roughly 3 out of 4,000.",,,1611103553,{},gjw5x14,False,t3_l0fbui,False,False,t1_gjvwf6g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l0fbui/daily_discussion_thread_january_19_2021/gjw5x14/,1611229243,17,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

No sarcasm, this study shows that a bunch of people felt bad after having covid (even 75 days later), but that there was little evidence of long-term physical damage.

&gt;We present the medium-term respiratory and self-perceived health of patients at a median of 75 days after diagnosis. **We found little evidence for post-infectious pulmonary fibrosis on chest x-ray or hypoxia on 6MWT.** However, 62% of patients did not feel back to full health, and this was associated with increased perception of exertion. 47% of our cohort met the diagnostic criteria for fatigue, independent of initial severity of infection. This study highlights the persistence of ill health following SARS-CoV-2 infection that presents a serious burden to quality of life. The lack of association with infection severity highlights that this may be an issue for a large number of patients, and this should be used to inform management strategies for convalescent patients.

&gt; I'll also remind you, maybe you're very young

I'm not. But your overall point seems to be that Fauci was clueless and thought that coronavirus would just fizzle out. Great. Great defense of him.

&gt; Again - In early days the knowledge we had was - this virus stays viable on surfaces for a long time (touching face is a big threat then) - and doesn't hang in the air for long (so masks unless you're sick - which again, he said in another quote elsewhere that was a good idea). 

Where was the data about virus staying viable on surface for a long time outside of lab settings? and going ""poof"" in the air. What was he basing that on? Complete nonsense. 

&gt; That's... Would you prefer new data comes in slower? 

I prefer data to come in as soon as possible and people who make wrong decisions to get the fuck out of the way. Especially in high positions. Fauci was one of them. He was wrong on EVERYTHING until it was entirely way too late. Was he the only one? Nope.

If you don't see this, fine. We'll never agree on it. 

No? It's implying that people should care about the flu also. I'll also remind you, maybe you're very young - but SARS-CoV (the first) was shaping up to be terrible, but fizzled out due to it's ability to spread. Early days there's still hope that this will fizzle out. Saying ""this is the biggest threat ever 100%!!11oneone!"" and then it fizzles out? Then you have people like you saying ""see never listen when they say a virus is a threat again""

&gt;Lol... sure, handshake doesn't communicate anything. Sure. 

They really don't. I've gotten limp noodles from CEO's of biotech startups that and rockhard shakes from undergraduates who flunked out. Noodles from chill AF guys, and solid shakes from total jagoffs. They tell me nothing about their personality, their abilities, nothing.

&gt;You want me to tell you what was wrong with saying ""there's no reason to be walking around with a mask""? Ask New Yorkers... wonder if it would've been helpful had they been wearing masks starting February. I dunno. February Fauci clearly says no. I find it interesting that you want me to find something false about that statement. 

Again - In early days the knowledge we had was - this virus stays viable on surfaces for a long time (touching face is a big threat then) - and doesn't hang in the air for long (so masks unless you're sick - which again, he said in another quote elsewhere that was a good idea). Why do you think it's false? We make recommendations based on the best information we have at the time. If you were in a battle, and your initial Intel told you the enemy was coming from the south - but then you got new sat data showing they swung east - would you keep defending the south?

&gt;You know what's a real unintended consequence? Saying that no masks are needed... and then flipping on that same statement a few weeks later in panic.

That's... Would you prefer new data comes in slower?

People, thousands of them, are literally drowning in their own fluids right now from a preventable disease. Around 4000 of them die. Every. Single. Day. 

9/11 may or may not have been preventable (not going anywhere near that can of worms). However Covid could have been prevented on two fronts: 1. If top leadership listened to science and nipped it in the bud back in January 2020. And 2. If people followed through with safety precautions against contagion. 

If anything, it's more of a tragedy because people still deny it exists. Still deny that they're dying from it. Still think it's a hoax and flaunt mask regulations. Also, it's more of a tragedy because, instead of a one time attack, like 9/11, it's a continuous, day-to-day onslaught.

It's still an open question as to whether the vaccines we're getting will just prevent disease (""preventive immunity"") versus also preventing transmission (""sterilizing immunity""). For any disease, that distinction apparently depends on particulars of both the pathogen and the vaccine.

The folks on [This Week in Virology](https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/) have been discussing this on occasion for the last few months; they mentioned recently that one of the manufacturers has a study on transmission planned which would involve a bunch of students on college campuses.

The traditional homemaker that didn’t work outside the home may not qualify, which was quite common among our current retirees. 
The deductible for Part A is almost $1500 unless you buy a supplemental plan. (Supplemental plans are Part C.) 
And if you have a hospitalization plus rehab that lasts 60-90 days (not uncommon), you pay $371 for each of those days. 
After 90 days, it’s over $700 per day until you meet a lifetime max of 60 days. Then you pay the entire cost. 
***With COVID-19, hospitalizations plus rehab often reach 3-6 months. A 90 day stay would cost $12,630 even with Medicare part A. A 6 month stay would be over $77,000!***
Medicare part B, which covers doctor appointments, physical therapy, lab work, imaging, etc, has a premium. It is not free.  The premium is at least $148 per person. So a married couple would pay at least $296 per month.
Medicare part D, for prescriptions, is also not free. The cost varies a lot, so I’m not going to include it here.

And Social Security pays seniors very little each month.  
$794 for an individual, $1191 for a couple per month. 

So, $1191-$296=**$895 per month income for a couple to live on, regardless of where they live, without any prescription drug coverage or supplemental to cover deductibles and copays associated with Part B** $895 for food for two people, utilities, prescriptions, clothes, gas for a car or bus transportation, etc.

This is similar to the vaccines being developed by Johnson and Johnson and, separately, by the team of Oxford University and AstraZeneca. The virus is used to introduce a gene into cells, which then produce proteins to which the immune system mounts a response.

&gt; In early January, a Tokyo man in his 80s with diabetes tested positive for COVID-19.

&gt; He soon started to have difficulty breathing. But with hospital beds filling up fast, public health authorities couldn’t immediately place him under medical care.

&gt; Then he showed moderate signs of recovery, which emboldened officials to decide that he could, after all, remain at home to recuperate — despite the capital’s guidelines saying that those age 70 or older with an underlying condition should in principle be hospitalized.

&gt; A few days into self-isolation his condition quickly worsened. Only then was he rushed to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

There are already too many cases to handle the situation in Kanagawa properly (south from Tokyo) 

&gt; Kanagawa became the nation’s first prefecture to forge ahead with such a drastic scaling down of contact-tracing, which had been the linchpin of Japan’s battle against the pandemic.

&gt; “We have so many people testing positive for COVID-19 that it takes us forever to trace the contact history of every single one of them, which risks a delay in our other responsibilities including anti-cluster measures for the elderly facilities,” Ono said.

&gt; “Infections are so widespread that the kind of aggressive contact-tracing we used to do is no longer serving its purposes,” Ono said. “So we can’t really spend our resources doing that anymore, and have to shift toward allocating more support for high-risk patients.”",,,1611126417,{},gjx7aq5,True,t3_l13xlh,False,False,t3_l13xlh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l13xlh/access_denied_virus_third_wave_forces_hand_of/gjx7aq5/,1611253303,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

   &gt;&gt;A People who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection are usually protected from being
infected a second time (called re-infection). This is because they develop neutralizing antibodies that remain in their blood for at least 5-6 months, maybe longer. These antibodies bind to specific parts of the spike protein that have mutated in the new variant (K417N and E484K mentioned above). We now show that these mutations have allowed the virus to become resistant to antibody neutralization.
&gt;&gt; The blood samples from half the people we tested showed that all neutralizing activity was lost. This suggests that they may no longer be protected from re-infection. In the other half, the levels of antibodies were reduced and so the risk of re-infection is not known. It is therefore important that people who have previously had COVID-19 continue to adhere to public health measures. Protecting ourselves through masks, regular washing or sanitising of hands, cleaning of surfaces, and social distancing remain the best defense against all SARS-CoV-2 viruses, including the new lineage.

If it had fizzled out in the spring like the flu, then its impact would be much closer to the flu. But the fact that it kept going unchecked is what raises the impact.",,,1611151225,{},gjy0bf4,False,t3_l0fbui,False,True,t1_gjwub5c,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l0fbui/daily_discussion_thread_january_19_2021/gjy0bf4/,1611272647,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
[],,thegoat83,,,[],,,,text,t2_13flx5,False,False,[],"1) It's still a lot of death. Let's assume the ""99.5% survival rate"" number is correct (although it's not - see point 5 below). This translates to an Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) of 0.5%. If we just didn't suppress the virus, this would kill up to 300,000 people in a country the size of the UK, or up to 1.55 million in the US. Here's how we worked this out:
Because of specific characteristics of the coronavirus, the infection spreads far more rapidly than a typical influenza virus. It would infect—and kill—far more people if no interventions were in place. The total impact of the disease, if no action was taken, is known as the final attack rate of the virus, and is calculated from the R0 number, which is the number of further virus cases you'd expect to be spread by a single infected person.
As Covid is estimated to have an R0 between 2.5–3.5, the final attack rate is estimated at around 80-95% - that's the proportion of the population that would be infected if nothing was done to curb its spread. It would result in 0.4–0.475% of the entire population dying from the disease using an IFR estimate of 0.5% (266,000 to 316,000 people in the United Kingdom, 1.31 to 1.55 million people in the United States). By the way, this would make it around 66-175 times more deadly than, say, the 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic, which was estimated to have an IFR of 0.0076% and a final attack rate of 30-80%.

2) The IFR is kept low because the disease is being suppressed. At the moment, most people who catch Covid and become seriously ill are treated in hospital. That keeps the fatality rate low - lower than it would be if fewer of those people received adequate treatment. Without efforts to suppress the virus—if the virus was allowed to run rampant—hospitals would quickly become full, and many of those who currently survive a Covid infection would not receive treatment and would die. This means that the IFR has a kind of ""observer effect"" - it's dependent on the sorts of measures society takes to suppress the virus. 

3) A single IFR number is oversimplified. Again, let's assume the 99.5% survival rate number is correct, so the Infection Fatality Ratio is 0.5%. That's an average, but we know that the survival rate differs dramatically by age. If you're under 35, the survival rate is more like 99.996% (though see point 3 below for an important point about this). But if you're over 85, the survival rate is only around 72% - that is, 28% of people in this age bracket will die of the disease if they catch it. When people talk about the ""99.5% survival rate"", they mean ""on average"" - and that average helps them forget the dramatically higher fatality rate in older people. Even for the not-so-elderly—for example, 60-year-olds with on average 24 years of life ahead of them—their Covid fatality rate, which is 1%, is more than double their usual annual chance of dying.

4) Death isn't the only thing that matters. By now there are many credible reports of long-term after-effects of Covid-19: even if it doesn't kill you, it could still affect your heart, lungs, or even your brain. There's even a name for the longer-term conditions: ""Long Covid"". And that's leaving aside the experience of getting the disease itself, which for many people ranges from an extremely unpleasant few days or weeks to a harrowing experience on a ventilator in an intensive care unit. Focusing only on deaths ignores all of the additional suffering Covid causes - even to the young.

5) It's not the right number anyway. Certain researchers have underestimated the IFR of Covid-19, mainly because they didn't include all the relevant data in their studies. The initial ""seroprevalence"" studies were known to have serious problems with bias: they didn't collect random samples, and instead asked people more likely to have had the disease to take part. This made it seem like the disease was far more prevalent than it really was, and led to an underestimate of how many people the disease killed (it wrongly increased the denominator in the ""no. of deaths divided by no. of infections"" calculation). Better estimates report that the IFR is more like 0.68%, or a 99.33% survival rate, if you prefer (though remember, as per point 1, above, this translates to a lot of death). In any case, as we've seen, it's questionable how useful a single IFR estimate is, anyway.

6) In some circumstances, the IFR will be even higher than this. This is an add-on to point 2, above. Because the IFR varies so much by age, the number of elderly people in a population and their likelihood of catching the virus can affect the ratio significantly. The 0.5% estimate we're discussing here assumes a globally average population structure and assumes that young people are more likely to catch the virus. In countries with more elderly people, like the U.K. or where elderly people catch it at similar rates to younger people—for example, in situations of unmitigated spread—the IFR will likely be even higher.",,,1611151223,{},gjy0baa,False,t3_l14l7g,False,True,t1_gjxiczk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l14l7g/antivirus_the_covid19_faq/gjy0baa/,1611272645,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

YOU HAVE BEEN SUBSIDIZED SINCE BIRTH. 

Do you drive on roads? Have you ever been to a Library? Have you ever been inside a public school? Do you have water and sewer and electric hook up at your house? Do you enjoy the protections afforded to you by the United States Armed Forces? Have you ever had a student loan? Have you ever had to rely on unemployment? Have you ever seen a police officer out on the street or the highway? Do you believe that 911 would come to your aid if you called? 

Your day-to-day life is saturated with the collective good provided by the government, on levels that range from federal all the way down to municipal. You are subsidized, and everyone else is subsidized, through the taxes that we already pay into the system already in place.  

And on to the health insurance... 

INSURANCE IS MAKING A GROUP OF PEOPLE SUBSIDIZE ONE ANOTHERS HEALTHCARE. 

Christ, do you not pay insurance? Do you not deal with co-pays and premiums, deductibles and limits and supplemental insurance and prescription insurance? Have you waded your way through the quagmire that is dental and vision? I suspect not. The money that I pay into that insurance system goes to pay for healthcare for other people who utilize the insurance more than I do. If you are against subsidy, you are against insurance. Health insurance. Home insurance. Auto insurance. 

Not fair? In that case, you better refuse ambulance service, police protection and fire protection. Gotta stay off all city/county/state and interstate roads... unless you personally own the road on that property, or have personal permission from the person who does own it, you are guilty of being subsidized by driving on it. The building and maintenance of those roads, as well as traffic planning and snow removal are subsidized. You’re going to need to unhook your water and sewer facilities, and figure out a way to dig a well and install some form of sewage containment. I’m not sure how to take away your public school education, but that was subsidized as well. You need to make sure that any hospital you might go to does not receive federal grants or aid, because that’s subsidized. And if you find yourself in the middle of a natural disaster, you’re on your own. Emergency management, and the National Guard are all government services you do not believe in. 

Get off that elitist high horse.

From an epidemiological perspective whether it makes sense to do that or not depends on what kind of kind of protection and sterilizing immunity a single shot offers compared to two shots.

On the other hand, if one shot is 65% protection and two shots is 85% then giving people single shots is more compelling.

I don’t know what you’re reading.  But I think you might be getting confused by the fact there are more positive headlines about Pfizer?  (Like this one.)

That’s just because Pfizer’s a bigger company and slightly quicker at getting their research (and product) out.  Give it two weeks and Moderna will release a study saying their vaccine works against the UK strain too.

About the only real difference is price (Moderna is significantly more expensive) and ease of handling (Moderna is easier to store than Pfizer).   

The rest is just marketing/speed.   Pfizer has been sold to a lot of countries, Moderna has only been sold to the US, UK, and a couple of others.   Not because the product is much different, just that Pfizer’s a huge old Euro manufacturer and had the advantage of familiarity (and price).   But either of them could sell easily 10 times what they can produce.  So it’s fine.   We need both of them.   Would be even better if there was a 3rd or 4th version.

I’m a left-leaning Aussie (so some kind of  tree-hugging radical socialist by American standards) and I’m jealous you guys have Moderna.   (Our government also invested in a new tech vaccine but ours failed.)  Don’t hate on it because of Trump money.  That’s ridiculous.

When we look at circulating betacoronaviruses, both in humans and in animals, the spike and its morphology remain very consistent. We do not see wild alterations or total loss of this feature. This provides strong evidence that the spike *must*, in some sense, be as it is. 

In turn, we should expect immunity generated via exposure to the spike antigen to be pretty robust against variants. This is of course one of the reasons why this antigen was chosen in the first place.

If they were exposed to an early variant of the virus they would likely still have circulating antibodies.  If they were not exposed, then they would likely not have the antibodies since the Wuhan antibody positive rate is about 4.9% and the natural cross-reactive positive rate on many antibody tests is only 1-2%.  An openly conducted test could remove a lot of the conspiratorial thinking and talk and let us move on to other theories.  There will be a lot of nutty idiots who will still believe anything (and will focus on the few false positive's and weave a web of nutty connections) but if only a couple lab employees out of 100's test positive and those employee's close contacts test negative; I think we can move on to non lab-leak theories.

In addition, any people associated with Minks, Ferrets, Shrews, etc... (the animals that seem to really easily get infected with this virus and IMHO the most likely intermediate host) in the Wuhan area should be tested for antibodies.  It would also be interesting to test any traders or farmers of such animals, including those in Wuhan or in the area 1000 miles to the southwest where Horseshoe bats are prevalent for these antibodies.

We really need to figure out if this is from a lab or not.

I didn't claim that's what happened. I offered it as a ""could've"" given two facts. The donations are Baltimore centric. Baltimore is a single party town that the Democratic party dominates locally. Second, we are talking about a doctor making periodic small donations over the course of 18 years. That strikes me as less about support of a cause and more about doling out some money now and again. Very likely the donation is more about social graciousness than political support. 

I'll take your word for it that his wife didn't make any donations. That doesn't mean he didn't buy the tickets to the dinner as a present to her. That doesn't mean he didn't spend the money at her behest.

Anecdotally, I heard that the article's characterization of the situation was colored a bit differently than reality.  It wasn't so much Governor Inslee saying ""speed up delivery"", it was Governor Inslee telling the hospital ""If you don't administer the doses you're sitting on right away, I'm going to take them away and give them to someone who will.""  

In a county with a population of 60k, vaccinating 2% of the population in a single day is kind of a big deal.  I know many people (including myself) have mixed opinions of the role of religious institutions in society, but helping a community mobilize to quickly distribute vaccines is a pretty darn good role.   

Here's the article's full text in case you run into a paywall: 

&gt; '**Pop-up' vaccine distribution event draws crowd in College Place**

&gt; Cars were parked for blocks around Walla Walla University Church in College Place on Monday as news spread of a free vaccine distribution event organized in a matter of hours.
&gt; 
&gt; Health officials say this will be one of many local events now that Gov. Jay Inslee announced Monday the vaccine eligibility of anyone 65 years and older.
&gt; 
&gt; Walla Walla University Church officials notified their congregation, and the news traveled through the community.
&gt; 
&gt; Postcards were handed to people who came to the church Monday morning and were eligible to receive a vaccine, with numbers for a place in line to get the first dose of Pfizer vaccine. People sat waiting in their cars for their number to be called through the radio.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Those whose numbers were called lined up — distanced 6 feet apart with masks — to get their vaccine. Many were turned away because the 1,200 vaccine doses available were already allocated to people before the event was over.
&gt; 
&gt; “We knew we had to partner with someone that could help us get everybody together quickly and to help provide a location that was safe,” said Dr. Christopher Hall, chief medical officer for Providence St. Mary Medical Center.
&gt; 
&gt; “Just about 24 hours ago, there was a conference call between Governor Inslee and the chief executive of hospitals. We got the message that we need to speed up delivery, and we need to get anything that we have in supply, even if it’s reserved for people with appointments, and we need to get it in arms.”
&gt; 
&gt; Health officials said they hope to get out almost 2,000 vaccines by the end of this week.
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s pretty amazing to see people come together so quickly and have such a successful event like this with literally hardly any warning. I just think it’s a miracle.” Dr. Daniel Kaminsky, public health officer for Walla Walla County said.
&gt; 
&gt; “We’re working on a venue at the (Walla Walla County) Fairgrounds, and we may expand it to a couple other venues in town.”
&gt; 
&gt; Many people receiving the vaccines expressed excitement and relief after waiting a long time that day and months prior.
&gt; 
&gt; Naina Rao had someone take a picture of her getting the vaccine.
&gt; 
&gt; “It feels great. I’ve been waiting for it,” Rao said.
&gt; 
&gt; Walla Walla County’s Department of Community Health partnered with Providence St. Mary Medical Center and Providence Population Health to get the vaccines out, according to Walla Walla University Church’s Facebook post.",,,1611101362,{},gjw1pp3,True,t3_l0wrol,False,False,t3_l0wrol,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l0wrol/24_hours_after_wa_governor_gives_speed_up_mandate/gjw1pp3/,1611226954,27,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Talking about how 1 in 8 patients released from the hospital die 5 months later is not particularly relevant to kids when the vast majority of those patients are 65+.

Do we have any data, 10+ months into the pandemic, that there is significant long-term damage to a significant population of kids who acquired covid?  If not, we have to move on once the adults are vaccinated.  We can work on a kid vaccine in parallel and roll that out when it's ready, but we have to let schools get back to normal.

I'd like you to do a thought experiment with me.  Imagine that covid never killed 400,000 people in America over the last year.  Instead, 1,000 people (a mixture of kids and adults) died from it.  And no social distancing or masking was ever done.  Schools weren't shut down. 

Would you be up in arms about the unknown long-term effects of the disease?  Would you be advocating for extraordinary measures?  Because that is essentially the position we will find ourselves in once most adults are vaccinated.

I'd suggest that you are suffering from a bias caused by seeing how badly covid has impacted the elderly.  If that had never happened (our situation once they're vaccinated), this would be a much smaller deal and everybody's opinion on this subreddit would be different.

Nobody was up in arms about the tens of thousands of people (including hundreds of kids) who die every year from flu.  Because 30,000 people is way, way different from 400,000 people (and 400,000 is with extraordinary measures).",,,1611100972,{},gjw0yu5,False,t3_l0l3gm,False,False,t1_gjvyhum,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l0l3gm/hundreds_of_children_being_admitted_to_arizona/gjw0yu5/,1611226549,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

One thing people also tend to forget about is the *rate of vaccination*. As of 1/11, NYC had vaccinated 226,258 people; as of 1/18, that number was up to 403,157. That’s around ~177k people vaccinated within the *first week* of the governor expanding eligibility, *in NYC alone*.

A quick glance at statewide data shows that NYC accounts for a little under half the vaccines administered thus far (in fact, Cuomo has us lagging behind most other regions in the state in terms of utilization).

In that same week, New York *State* (not sure what the breakdown is for NYC specifically) received 209,400 additional doses.

Now, obviously New York isn’t going to jump from 40% utilization to 100% utilization overnight. But if you look at the math (and, if you like, make the very reasonable assumption that we have the capacity to administer even more vaccines than we did last week, since now we have more distribution centers set up), we’re doing a pretty reasonable job of burning through the stockpile. Here’s why:

Let’s generously assume 1.5 million vaccines have been delivered to NY (the state tracker claims 1.2 million have actually been received). Let’s also assume statewide total distribution is 2x that of NYC (in fact, it’s greater - NYC is lagging). Let’s also assume the state receives 250k doses a week (though we’ve received less the last three weeks). New York is optimistically set to exhaust its supply within 5.5 weeks, and *that’s if we don’t vaccinate any faster than we did last week*.

If schools are taking active measures to prevent the spread of COVID within the school, such as keeping students in the same room all day so that they are only ever exposed to a single class of students, then the vaccine rollout will help a lot to keep the students safe. 

If schools do not do anything to keep students safe though, then the vaccine won't really help at all - once a student is infected it would spread throughout the school normally.

Money dictating research results, or rather not paying for/not publishing unwanted results, is a fairly common thing. Trust is also vital to science, since general public can't possibly understand the raw research, so they always accept it through an authority telling them it is the truth. This is why trust is so vital to governing people. Once you lose it, through whatever means, everything claimed through authority becomes suspect and unreliable. This is where a lifetime of news about incompetence, lying, and corruption takes its toll on the public trust towards authority.

 There's a lot more information you can determine looking at a process than simply a trend if you capture that information along the way, you can look at how much time each activity takes, presuming there's some sort of repeatable workflow, you can identify what points of the process take longer and look there for opportunities to improve.  You can even look for outliers in terms of both activity and data to identify and quantify the inaccuracies in reporting you claim exist.

Unless this reporting is being done on pen and paper, I can't imagine reporting adding any more overhead beyond ""I gave this person this dose, they need another appointment in X days"".

1) Prevent/reduce disease in the vaccinated person

2) Prevent/reduce transmission from the vaccinated person to others

3) Prevent the pathogen from infecting the vaccinated person.

Goal 3 is harder than goal 2 is harder than goal 1. People who are talking about sterilizing immunity are talking about goal 3. But what is really relevant with respect to dropping masks and social distancing is goal 2.

""The piece cites a dangerously wrong quote — disappointingly by an infectious disease physician in NEJM — that suggests no existing vaccines prevent disease without also preventing transmission."" -- this is talking about goal 2.

""High-profile research by Nicola Klein, Tod Merkel and others has shown the pertussis vaccine is well known to prevent disease, but not an infection."" -- the goal post has been shifted to goal 3. 

I think most scientists know that because of the lack of IgA, the current vaccines aren't going to achieve goal 3. But they expect goal 2 to be substantially achieved, even if transmission is not 100% prevented. 

Your Salt Lake Tribune article writes:

&gt;Overall, I think it would be reasonable to estimate that vaccines **reduce transmission from anywhere from 30% to 90%** — a huge range, to be sure, but it depends on the vaccine used and the accuracy of these studies with limited sample sizes. 

The Nature article writes:

&gt; This could lead to vaccines that, although protecting from symptomatic disease, might still enable transmission of the virus. In this case, the **amount of virus shed and the duration of shedding might be reduced**. 

They both expect partial reduction of transmission. There are many reasons to expect that the efficacy in reducing transmission would be somewhere between the efficacy in preventing disease and the efficacy in preventing asymptomatic cases.

COVID is essentially pneumonia on steroids with 3x the spreadability and increased chances of death. Not to mention 80% of pneumonia deaths are due to patients not accepting aggressive care. 

This also ignores medium term implications from COVID even for young people such as shortness of breath and blood clots.

This chain of data was just never ready to work this way, so we are very much dealing with ""garbage in, garbage out"". Maybe it will explain best if I just list the issues I've see (and this is just the hospital system to state exchange, leaving out the state to CDC):

1. Hospital system not set up with state interface (usually the ambulatory sites are the ones that worry about this)

2. Access issues to the state system result in one person manually entering hundreds of vaccines.

3. System set up with automation is not sending patients are by design vaccine registry is set up for only patients under 19

4. EMR vendor not sending fields required by state, files go unprocessed

5. Misplaced spaces in flatfiles, files don't process

6. Vaccines administered without pulling from ""allotment"" in state system, vaccines don't automatically ""count"", as system sees it as nothing available

7. Vaccines actually administered without being documented in the EMR that day.


So in a sense I agree with you. The one thing I was reached out for was to design a database/system similar to as you described in your last paragraph, so at least we are good there.

One thing I'm not clear on is an idea being floated to prioritize states that are actually distributing the vaccine.

Of course no patent waivers can overcome the logistical challenges, but you'd be naive to think that the block will have no effect on vaccine access.

What if the government mandated abortion for fetuses with hereditary birth defects like down's syndrome or Parkinson's? This helps everyone else by protecting the gene pool from spreading birth defects and prevents drains on the welfare state.

However, I think you'd agree that the government requiring such a medical procedure is unethical, because it infringes on bodily autonomy and personal freedom.

So, if the government has the authority to mandate you take a vaccine to prevent the spread of Coronavirus, it also means it has the authority to mandate individuals undergo medical procedures for the good of the public at the expense of the individual. Which means it has the authority to sterilize people with hereditary genetic defects, or abort fetuses with the same, or even mandate a vaccine that reduces the spread of disease, but also gives you an egg allergy, or has other drawbacks that someone might not consent to.

Gottlieb estimated that 30% of the population will be exposed by the end of January, and 10% will be vaccinated. Let's say that he is a little low and it's 40% been exposed. That means half of the country will be immune. This is not ""herd immunity"" but is enough to reduce the spread.

Look at it another way, you can't continue to have exponential growth forever. You simply run out of people.

I don't think they really have any good way to accurately measure how many people have been exposed, the antibody tests are not very accurate and you'd have to give a huge number of them to really measure. So they can only estimate.

&gt;The persistently rapid spread of the coronavirus in Texas, the second most populous state in the U.S., is threatening the gradual progress the country has been making toward flattening the curve of new cases.

&gt;Counties along the Mexican border in particular have seen steep spikes. The city of Laredo sent residents an emergency cellphone alert over the weekend — the second in three days — warning that local hospitals were near capacity.

&gt;”Our medical professionals and hospitals are overwhelmed with the surge in Covid-19 cases,” the message read. “The current situation is at its most critical level, and lives are at stake. We are asking you to stay home unless it is absolutely necessary.”

&gt;New cases in Texas were averaging more than 20,000 per day on Monday. The state has seen a steady increase in new cases since October, when there were approximately 4,000 a day on average, according to a New York Times database.

I don't know how you can look at data clearly trending down (that is continuing to going down a day after I posted it) and say its trending up. Is your monitor upside down? Do you not know how to read graphs? Do you not know what trend means?

You point out how data points are a weekend, which is irrelevant when you take in the 7 day average... which it does.

The 7 day average has substantially dropped to roughly the same as the beginning of December (this is a POSITIVE even though you think its negative somehow, it means we're going in the right direction, which I remind you, we are). And it is very likely it will continue to trend down going forward. Probably not at the current rate its dropping, but it will continue to trend downward. I'll come back in a couple weeks to see where we're at.

I get that the trend might not hold, but given the lack of big holiday events going forward combined with the continued rollout of vaccines along with the sheer number of people infected already... I have no idea how you could look at this and say the opposite of reality.

Thinking I misunderstood something I went back to the original comment and... nah, I'm good.  Their post explicitly says to send kids to school because it's ""just the flu"" for them.  While that may be true: 1. no one yet knows the long term effects of Covid 2. kids can be a vector and pass on Covid to more vulnerable people and 3. as the article states, some kids do have severe Covid and end up hospitalized.  While the vast majority will recover, it still increases the strain on already overloaded healthcare systems.  

Kids will not be inoculated for a while longer yet.  I'm not keeping my kids home until they themselves are immune, just until vulnerable populations are vaccinated and the healthcare systems aren't being overwhelmed.

I'm no victim.  If you feel as though I'm lashing out, it's probably because myself and most of the reasonable, sane people are sick of the attitude that yourself and the OP are displaying and we understand that, in no small part, these attitudes are why the US is on pace to lose well over 500,000 people by Spring.",,,1611153838,{},gjy54gx,False,t3_l0l3gm,False,True,t1_gjy46z3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l0l3gm/hundreds_of_children_being_admitted_to_arizona/gjy54gx/,1611275505,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Substantial alteration of the sequences coding for the spike are most likely evolutionary dead-ends, rather than enhancements. 

In turn that means that immunity generated via exposure to the spike should be robust against all likely variants...which isn't a coincidence! It's why this antigen was chosen in the first place as the target for our vaccines.

China is the ONLY FRICKING COUNTRY in the world to actually do a lockdown. And it worked for them. 

Whenever something talks about how lockdowns don't work they talk in the context of countries that had curfews, ""essential"" business open with capacity restrictions, etc...

Which yes, they do **not** work since they are **not** lockdowns so those anti-lockdown protesters in the West are actually right: those lockdowns in name only do not work.

If they did work, Belgium and Italy wouldn't be in the top 5 in terms of deaths per million while Sweden would have the Top 1 spot. 

&gt;How the fuck will a virus spread from me to you, if me and you are in separate houses and never see each other?

Quite easily: essential workers spreading the virus, people violating curfew knowing beforehand that there's no strict punishment for doing so, the definition of ""essential business"" extending to things that are, strictly speaking, not essential, etc...

It doesn't matter if COVID spreads via air, via touch, via sneezing in someone elses mouth, via swapping spit, or via some dance ritual done when people see each other.  The fact is that if one person has COVID, and another person goes near them.  They are more likely to get COVID.

""Unlike several previous analyses, this was a study in a racially diverse population with a high proportion of Blacks/African Americans and...[it] revealed that metformin treatment of diabetes prior to diagnosis with COVID-19 was associated with a dramatic threefold reduced mortality in subjects with type 2 diabetes, even after correcting for multiple covariates,"" first author Anath Shalev, MD, of the Comprehensive Diabetes Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told Medscape Medical News.

But Anne Peters, MD, a professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, in Los Angeles, said caution is needed when interpreting these findings.

""It's hard to tease out the true effects because, for instance, those treated with insulin may be a sicker subset of patients with diabetes than those on metformin, or those with comorbidities such as renal insufficiency may not be treated with metformin"" she told Medscape Medical News.

""In general, though, treatment obviously matters and people who are better treated tend to do better, so while I think this study raises the question of what role metformin plays in the risk of mortality and COVID-19, I don't think it necessarily proves the association,"" Peters asserted.

Diverse Population

The new study, published this month in Frontiers of Endocrinology, included 25,326 individuals who were tested for COVID-19 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital between February and June 2020.

Overall, 2.4% tested positive for COVID-19 (n = 604), which the authors note is likely a low figure because screening included asymptomatic hospital staff and patients having elective procedures.

Black/African American patients had a significantly higher risk of COVID-19 positivity compared with White patients (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; P &lt; .0001). Rates were also higher among those with hypertension (OR, 2.46), diabetes (OR, 2.11), and obesity (OR, 1.93) compared to those without each condition (all P &lt; .0001).

The overall mortality rate in COVID-19-positive patients was 11%. Diabetes was associated with a dramatically increased risk of death (OR, 3.62; P &lt; .0001), and remained an independent risk factor even after adjusting for age, race, sex, obesity, and hypertension.

Notably, the reduction in mortality among those with diabetes taking metformin prior to COVID-19 diagnosis was significant: 11% of those patients died compared with 23% of those with diabetes not taking metformin (OR, 0.33; P = .021).

Similar Findings Reported Across Varied Populations

The study adds to mounting research suggesting metformin could have a protective effect on COVID-19 mortality, including an early report from Wuhan, China, findings from the French CORONADO study, and a US study linking treatment with decreased mortality among women with COVID-19.

Of note, the effects of metformin on mortality in the current study were observed in men and women alike, as well as in high-risk subgroups including African Americans.

""The fact that such similar results were obtained in different populations from around the world suggests that the observed reduction in mortality risk, associated with metformin use in subjects with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19, might be generalizable,"" the authors write.

""Furthermore, these findings underline the importance of following general diabetes treatment and prevention guidelines and not delaying or discontinuing any metformin treatment,"" they add.

Speculation of Mechanisms Includes Anti-Inflammatory Effects

While the mechanisms behind metformin's potential role in reducing mortality risk in COVID-19 are unknown, the authors note that the most obvious assumption — that improved glycemic control may be a key factor — is disputed by the study's finding that blood glucose levels and A1c were not significantly different among COVID-19 survivors taking versus not taking metformin.

They point instead to metformin's known anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties.

""We therefore hypothesize that by exerting some of these effects, metformin might improve outcomes and we are now in the process of investigating this possibility further,"" Shalev said.

Peters noted that anti-inflammatory properties, themselves, are not necessarily unique to metformin in the treatment of diabetes.

""Many other agents, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors can reduce inflammation, so I don't know if that would explain it, but it certainly could help,"" she said. ""[Reducing inflammation] is a hypothesis you see commonly with diabetes drugs, but I think there are also a lot of metabolic benefits from metformin.""

""It was fascinating that they had the A1c data and that survival with metformin didn't appear to be as related to A1c levels as one might think,"" she added.

Notably, a key advantage, should the effects and mechanisms be validated, is metformin's high accessibility, Peters added.

One thing is that usually the loss is total.

But having taste/smell loss is a huge indicator of covid19 - but don't expect it to happen for all covid19 patients.

Recovery can take a month for many cases.

However for those who take ivermectin a percentage can have partial reversal within 24 hours of starting it.  And near full recovery can take 2 weeks.

 I’ve heard others state similar concerns based on the notion of masks “don’t have any economical cost” so why not continue them, since they’re not the same as limiting occupancy or shutting down places.  And, that’s a completely legitimate concern, not based on some off the wall conspiracy theory. 

Maybe there’s a couple safeguards to that not happening. One, private businesses can determine whether or not to require patrons to wear masks for entry. I’d imagine that once deaths/cases drop, places like grocery stores and small businesses are going to be under a lot of public pressure to lift restrictions because those customers can, and will, take their business elsewhere. Perhaps some people will choose to wear a mask, but I can’t see it becoming required on a universal level, not in America at least. Imo, all it will take is for a few places to lift the requirement and others will follow so they don’t lose business.

&gt;Officials at the Wadsworth Center, New  York’s state lab, have access to C.T. values from tests they have  processed, and analyzed their numbers at The Times’s request. In July,  the lab identified 872 positive tests, based on a threshold of 40  cycles.  
&gt;  
&gt;With a cutoff of 35, about 43  percent of those tests would no longer qualify as positive. About 63  percent would no longer be judged positive if the cycles were limited to  30.  
&gt;  
&gt;In Massachusetts, from 85 to 90  percent of people who tested positive in July with a cycle threshold of  40 would have been deemed negative if the threshold were 30 cycles, Dr.  Mina said. “I would say that none of those people should be  contact-traced, not one,” he said.

If you think you've been exposed, best thing you can do is start quarantining (this means not leaving your house for anything that is not absolutely essential- if you can afford to get groceries delivered or do curbside pickup you should do that instead of going to the store, and things like that. if you must go outside, stay as strict as possible with your masking and distancing), and letting your close contacts from since exposure know you were exposed. About 5-7 days after the exposure happened, you should get a test. Your contacts should also get tested. If negative, continue to quarantine until 14 days after the exposure. If you develop symptoms at any point, begin to isolate (explained in the next paragraph).  


If you get a positive test (or you develop symptoms despite a negative test), you'll need to isolate. It's not too different from quarantining, but with an obviously stronger emphasis on not leaving the house. You should let any contacts know you're covid positive. If it's a positive test with no symptoms, I think it's ten days past the test if you stay asymptomatic before you can end isolation. If you do have symptoms, wait until 24 hours after your fever goes away for good and your other symptoms are improving before ending isolation. Best of luck, try not to worry too much. I've had a couple possible exposures over the course of this and nothing came out of it.

They originally promised 20 million doses to be available (not administered) by the end of the year, and got there on Jan 6, so not bad there either.

I think we only need to vaccinate about 10-15% of the population to make a big difference in illnesses.  80-90% of hospitalizations and fatalities are in the high risk group of 65+ with health conditions which are about 12-15% of the population.

At the beginning of this the data suggested, and what we knew from previous experience, that the virus was only viable in large droplets which fall off quickly and don't hang in the air. There were also early publications that showed viability of virions on surfaces for long times. In that scenario, touching a mask constantly is a good way of getting any droplets from your hands onto your face. We also were facing (and still do are some extent) a shortage of kn/n95 masks. The calculation, with that information, was - masks probably wouldn't do much to stop spread, but we'll 100% need them in hospitals so it's not in the best public health interest to recommend them. Remember - these people make decisions for the public at large - not you as an individual.

Now we know that surface spread isn't as big as we feared - and the virus can be viable in smaller particles. That changes the calculation.

It's not lying, it's making the best decision with the information available.

If you look at a scatter plot (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/18/us/covid-state-restrictions.html - pay wall, if you need a screen shot: https://imgur.com/wFDUxlE) you can see a pretty clear linear trend downward there, indicating that restrictions did help ease the burden significantly? I'm not sure what your contention is here. No one said ""2 weeks of restrictions then 100% back to normal!"" no one. Find me someone (in a public health capacity, not your cousin on facebook) who said that and I'll donate $20 to the charity of your choosing. 

&gt;Then “more testing,” then “fewer cases,” then “vaccine,” then “herd immunity via vaccine.” 

This makes no sense, can you elaborate more? 

Yes we needed more testing, but what does that have to do with vaccination?

The end zone was always herd immunity through vaccination. That's never changed? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here - do you guys really not remember when people said ""this may go until 2022"" because vaccines would take a long time? The time frame shrank... not extended.

&gt;And now we have the Zero Covid crew, who thinks we’re in some kind of video game and need to stamp out the virus,

Who? Who in any public sphere is saying that.

Once we reach herd immunity and the spread is over, and we reach a point where spread is highly localized and limited? This is over.

My recollection is that it meant ""we need to flatten the curve within two weeks or the hospitals will be overwhelmed"" and after that we would just figure out what balance of reopening and restrictions we could live with.

Personally if it had no other impact I would say let people make their own decision as to whether or not they take precautions, close restaurants, visit family or whatever. But their actions would have significant impact on people who chose to avoid getting it too. It's reasonable to reach some compromise and adjust as necessary. That's what we've done.

Young athletes who have heart and lung damage. People who still have no sense of taste or smell, even after 10 months. 

But, my comment was about teachers, who no one seems to think about when talking about opening schools. Many schools closed in the fall because there simply weren’t enough substitutes to cover all of the COVID-19 exposures in their teachers and bus drivers. Adults must work for schools to be open. And the average age of both the teacher and bus driver population is high in this country, so they have more risk and a high probability of exposure.

You may not be familiar with the long-term problems that can happen with rheumatic fever, chickenpox, or poliovirus infections. 1)Rheumatic fever causes heart valve damage decades after infection. The valves can be replaced, but even then, people who experience this damage are far more likely to die from heart-related complications. 2)Poliovirus infections only caused muscle weakness and paralysis in 0.5% of infected patients. It’s believed that up to 70% of those infected had no symptoms at all. But, post-polio syndrome can cause muscle weakness (including involuntary muscles) years after an initial infection, even in people who hadn’t experienced symptoms with the initial infection. 3) Chickenpox can cause shingles decades later, regardless of the severity of the infection. The chickenpox virus enters the nervous system and lies dormant until it re-emerges, sometimes causing severe pain that can last for years. 

Three virus, all causing damage months to decades after infection. And there are more. It is irresponsible to assume that just because kids aren’t experiencing symptoms now that they never will.

All the data I've seen on the vaccines tells me that infections are soon going to take a very dramatic drop.  Deaths are going to drop.  Families are going to get together again.  Vaccines are catching up with the virus at a rapid pace, and even if it mutates enough to need a new vaccine the mrna vaccines only need 6 weeks to be altered.

no government can prevent people from being late for shit.

no government can prevent freezers from breaking.

either one of those happens and doses doesn't match arms.. and you have an ""emergency situation"" - random people getting the shot is better than the drain.

I’m more of a fan of using QALY because, while it makes calculations more difficult, better reflects the reality that statistically many of those dying from COVID are within 0-10 years from a projected date of natural death.",,,1611179623,{},gjzqukh,False,t3_l1iiwk,False,False,t1_gjzpjpu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l1iiwk/its_time_for_cost_benefit_analysis_of_lockdown/gjzqukh/,1611308683,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
