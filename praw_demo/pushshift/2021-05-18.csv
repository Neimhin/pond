Edit: From the CDC website:
What we are still learning

Scientists are still learning how well vaccines prevent you from spreading the virus. We‚Äôre also still learning how long COVID-19 vaccines protect people.

Although COVID-19 vaccines are effective at keeping you from getting sick, scientists are still learning how well vaccines prevent you from spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to others, even if you do not have symptoms. Early data show that vaccines help keep people with no symptoms from spreading COVID-19, but we are learning more as more people get vaccinated.

We‚Äôre also still learning how long COVID-19 vaccines protect people.

For these reasons, people who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 should keep taking precautions until we know more, like wearing a mask in indoor public places, avoiding large indoor gatherings, and washing your hands often. Vaccinated people do not need to wear masks outside except in crowds.

&gt;The previous deadliest day was recorded in the United States in January, when 4,468 people died.

&gt;Many experts believe the true number of deaths and infections is even higher, and evidence has emerged across the country of large numbers of people dying from Covid who have not been officially counted.

&gt;India reported 267,000 new cases on Tuesday, pushing the official case tally past 25 million, with more than 280,000 deaths.

&gt;While infections seem to be slowing down in some of India‚Äôs urban centers, including New Delhi and Mumbai, the virus is spreading in the countryside. Testing there is limited, the medical infrastructure is woefully underfunded and overwhelmed, and some leaders have been trying to downplay the damage, sometimes even criminalizing cries for help.

&gt;Experts warn that a drop in new daily cases is a likely reflection of the success of urban lockdowns but that the virus is still spreading elsewhere unchecked. Hospitals remain short of supplies, and the vaccination campaign has been slow. The death toll has remained over 4,000 for several days, suggesting that even if new infections are going down in urban centers, those infected earlier are dying.

&gt;The virus has taken a heavy toll on India‚Äôs doctors and medical workers as well.

&gt;More than 1,000 doctors have died of Covid since the pandemic began last year. The rate of deaths has been much higher, and the age of victims often much younger, since the second wave of infections started this spring. More than 260 doctors have died since April, according to the Indian Medical Association.

Florida also ended up becoming a vector for the rest of the country because of all of the tourism that happens there. I was exposed at work to a confirmed case by someone who had travelled there just as things were shutting down. I don't know precisely how many of other states' cases derived from Florida travel, but it's not zero.

That number could have been lower had DeSantis followed the science and performed like a leader instead of just telling people what they wanted to hear.

Heavily armed man in Belgium has virologists in their sights: ""Fear of violence"" 
By OUR EDITORIAL Updated Yesterday, 11:38 PM Yesterday, 19:11 abroad

Inset: a braised photo of the suspect who would drive around in an Audi with heavy weapons.

HASSELT - The Belgian police have started a manhunt in search of a heavily armed soldier who would threaten virologists. One of the country's most famous virologists, Marc van Ranst, has been housed in a safe house with his family, Nieuwsblad reports. ""There are fears of violent acts.""

The soldier had disappeared from his barracks with a few weapons, including a rocket launcher and a submachine gun. He would stay in Belgian Limburg, not far from the Dutch border. In the past, he has been very hard on social media at the Leuven scientist who is often seen in Belgian media.

The heavily armed man is on the terrorist list because of extreme right-wing sympathies, confirms Justice Minister Vincent Van Quickenborne.

It really does suck for the people who had treatment delayed.

I know this is very similar to the, imo crass, statement that OP references (cancer is not contagious) but this is the truth and it is independent of caring more or less for one specific illness.

Covid had the potential to crush healthcare under its presence, a scenario in which absolutely everybody suffers. It is not 'right' that anyone had to suffer at all but hard choices did have to be made.

All of this is not to say that the handling could not have been better, that we could not have been prepared to have green hospitals and red hospitals for covid/non covid. Speaking from my own country, the UK, we did in fact try to create something like this with the construction of temporary hospitals only to then realise that more hospitals without more staff simply does not work either.

Heavily armed man in Belgium has virologists in their sights: ""Fear of violence""

HASSELT - The Belgian police have started a manhunt in search of a heavily armed soldier who would threaten virologists. One of the country's most famous virologists, Marc van Ranst, has been housed in a safe house with his family, Nieuwsblad reports. ""There are fears of violent acts.""

The soldier had disappeared from his barracks with a few weapons, including a rocket launcher and a submachine gun. He would stay in Belgian Limburg, not far from the Dutch border. In the past, he has been very hard on social media at the Leuven scientist who is often seen in Belgian media.

The heavily armed man is on the terrorist list because of extreme right-wing sympathies, confirms Justice Minister Vincent Van Quickenborne. ""There are indications that he is violent and in the past 24 hours there have been indications that the man poses an acute threat,"" the minister told VTM Nieuws. His employer, Defense, will not comment.

The suspect's car was allegedly found by officers on Tuesday evening in a forest near Dilsen, right near the Dutch border. The man himself remains without a trace for the time being. The search continues unabated. Special forces are getting ready to further investigate the area. All residents are asked to stay indoors for their own safety and not to leave their homes.",,,1621424806,{},gyonsef,False,t3_ng2e7r,False,True,t3_ng2e7r,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ng2e7r/heavily_armed_soldier_has_gone_off_the_radar/gyonsef/,1621491794,15,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The only way that's going to happen is if political figures out on their kid gloves and don't anger the side that doesn't like to admit when they're wrong despite a pile of scientific studies. There is tremendous resistance to the vaccine in some areas/certain demographics, even in people who have all the other vaccinations because it's new and they're afraid of it for some reason. For a number of political and historical reasons people don't like medicine that's ""new"" or ""untested"" (I know, it went through clinical trials but that's one argument being repeated herein the US). It's not just a science thing - it's a social anthropology and psychology challenge to get people vaccinated as well. Biden is tasked with something really difficult, and I'm not saying he's always going about it the right way. I'm just saying that there's a huge attitude in the US of ""us vs them"" and it goes a lot deeper than the logic on the surface.  

It would seem like saying ""anyone who is vaccinated can come visit"" would be great, but if the US did that, many would follow, and the unvaccinated here would be PISSED. The world is still saying ""no US travelers - because pandemic"" which didn't go over well but still sort of held to the ""us vs them"" mentality but the second the phrase changes to ""no *unvaccinated* US travelers"" there's going to be a wave of outrage and Biden wants no part of that in an already super divided country.",,,1621434541,{},gyp8etq,False,t3_nfk8yy,False,True,t1_gynbdq4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nfk8yy/canada_will_need_75_vaccination_before_us_border/gyp8etq/,1621502986,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Is it that you want me to list every little policy being rolled out? I looked at their response, compared how they differ from most other places' responses, looked at CDC's messaging on what they're focusing on, and chose to base my post on that.

But regarding what you mentioned.

Takeout only restaurants. It's not even takeout only, this is actually something I wanted to criticize CDC for in my first post already but thought to spare it (perhaps I should have criticized it to be ""fair""). Restaurants can still open as long as they have partitions and follow distancing and record contact details.

SInce you feel this restaurant takeout is worth mentioning I'll thus ask, why isn't it takeout only already? Sure a lot of restaurants have volunteerily gone takeout only but that's mot required, and many are still allowing dine in.

Not everyone is a kid with both parents working, and I didn't say everyone is either, I said many. So not sure what's your point again. Yes there will be kids that will now be staying home and maybe one or both are their parents are able to be at home with them. But it doesn't change what I said regarding family where both parents work?

Closing the border. It helps prevent future ones while they're fighting the existing fire and allow allocating the border resources elsewhere, but the current outbreak all stems from the same generic sequence source as CDC so often like to point out, so it's not going to directly affect the containment effort.

Closing hotels and cinema.. that's pretty much a given considering they're always the first to go in restrictions. Can give them credit for that if you like but as I mentioned in the earlier post, I'm focusing on what I feel CDC think is going to make the difference. Closing cinema and hotels is pretty standard, I chalk it in the same list as the qr code contact tracing and encouraging people to stay home.",,,1621459748,{},gyqxh99,False,t3_nfy8xi,False,True,t1_gyqd2ro,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nfy8xi/coronavirus_taiwan_raises_alert_level_for_entire/gyqxh99/,1621541233,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The few people who do develop symptoms will likely not require any medical care and likely won't be hospitalized.

So there is a risk, but is it not very high. There was also a study I saw out of Israel that showed MRNA vaccine efficacy at closer to 97%.

If you are vaccinated, and still concerned, the CDC is not precluding you from continuing to mask up and avoiding others. Nobody can make you go to a broadway show or dine inside instead of getting takeout.

[],,EvanWithTheFactCheck,,,[],,,,text,t2_1420qr,False,True,[],"I live in San Francisco, one of the most liberal states in the US, and I know quite a few people who are vaccinate hesitant.

We all work together in healthcare.  Dental, to be exact.  And we‚Äôve been back at work since May of last year taking care of patient‚Äôs oral health.   Being so close to patient‚Äôs mouths with them not wearing a mask, and using professional dental hygiene tools that spray saliva into the air, it‚Äôs no surprise that one by one, we all caught covid last year. One of us in May 2020, two of us in November 2020, and one in December 2020.  

Because we all caught it and recovered, we all have antibodies and T-cell immunity.  We don‚Äôt need the vaccine to eliminate ourselves from the transmission chain.  We don‚Äôt need to get the vaccine to contribute to herd immunity.  We already are contributing to these goals.

I remember reading an article back in January stating that nurses in the Bay Area (a generally super liberal and high complaint region) had unusually high rates of vaccine hesitancy compared to others.  The article didn‚Äôt state the reason, but I imagine it‚Äôs for the same reason as the staff at my dental clinic.  A lot of nurses probably already recovered from a covid infection and are now immune.   People who don‚Äôt work in healthcare in similar capacities don‚Äôt understand this, so they call us selfish and stupid and Republican, even though SF is about as progressive as you can get.

I also have a big circle of friends in the black community, and black people, at least the ones I know out here, are also more vaccine hesitant as a group (and they‚Äôve also been far less mask compliant throughout the entirety of this pandemic).  They speak of distrust in the government, citing the Tuskegee experiment, an unethical experiment the US Public Health Service conducted on black people in which the all-black subjects were told they were receiving free healthcare from the government for 6 months to treat their syphilis infections, but really the government withheld life-saving treatment from them so that they can study the course of untreated syphilis in the human body.  Instead of lasting 6 months, this study continued for 40 years, killing over 100 of the subjects with untreated syphilis, even though a cure was available.  Considering the US public health department literally lied to them and prevented them from getting life-saving treatment just to observe them falling apart and dying for 40 years (and passing congenital syphilis to their kids too), can you blame some black people for being wary the next time the same US public health department is once again offering them something that is supposedly good for their health?

I went into an in depth conversation about covid vaccination with one of these black men a couple months ago to try to understand his hesitation.  My friend is someone who is very pro-BLM and believes wholeheartedly that America operates on systemic white supremacy at every level in every institution, and that our racist white government considered black lives to be disposable.  I‚Äôve heard from him in the past that he thinks some malicious public agencies, like the police, are even actively trying to hunt down black people to kill them. 

Given that we just had an entire year of protests BLM narrating similar notions, can you blame him for being suspicious of a vaccine created under Trump and distributed by the supposed racist white supremacists who run out country?  He said he believes that, even if the studies found the vaccine to be uniquely harmful to black people, that information would be publicly withheld while  public officials push black people to take the vaccine to save white lives. 

Frankly, I don‚Äôt share his paranoia.  But I also don‚Äôt blame him for not trusting public health officials after we spent a year sowing distrust in the black community of the systems around them by pushing the narrative that American institutions such our healthcare system is run on systemic racism and operated by racist white supremacists who have no regard for black lives. 

BLM taught them not to trust our public officials.

I'm using Hong Kong as an example, as I am familiar with the city. Covid is well controlled and life is practically normal unless you get very unlucky. Currently everyone 16+ can get vaccinated, for free, at a government vaccination centre or private doctor. You get to choose the Chinese vaccine or BioNtech (Pfizer). It's easy to book and there's lots of stock. Only 16 percent of people had at least one dose. People are simply not taking up the vaccine. I've heard reasons from 'what about the side effects?!', 'there's no point until we are allowed to go on holiday' to general government distrust. Unfortunately places like HK can't open up until they get everyone vaccinated, but people are also not willing to get vaccinated until they are allowed more convenient travel. The general mood is zero covid, zero risk, with no regards or discussion on the negatives on zero covid. Even with vaccines there will be breakthrough cases, I doubt places like HK are willing to take small risks for a more open border. 

I'm in the UK, the whole attitude towards vaccination is completely different. Because covid has ripped through society, everyone wants to be vaccinated to get out of it (similar attitudes in Europe and US).

Sinopharm was more effective in trials (70%-ish). Sinovac was barely 50%. Sinovac - while definitely better than nothing - is in the long run going to need to be augmented by more effective vaccines as it's just not good enough to induce herd immunity. 

Seychelles is a bit of an edge case. It's very unclear what percent of the cases are actually from Indian tourists. They also have virtually no natural immunity as they had no outbreaks previously. So between Sinopharm's lower efficacy and the Indian factor I think that is why you are seeing a ""surge"" to so speak.

It was bad enough that hospital groups were having to put their doctors on leave for a lack of patients. 

Because of this though I was able to refer myself to a top cancer specializing hospital and get in right away for an appointment with the surgeon that is the head of their department that handles my type of cancer, who I was told would normally have a wait time of months if you could get to see him at all. My whole process of referral to done with surgery was just two months, which is really fast. This was likely only possible, for me to be able to see the top surgeon and in such an expedited manner, because of the lack of patients. 

I had to take a few covid tests before my surgery and my hospital stays to protect the staff, and I was only allowed 1 person to stay with me after the surgery (shortly after I left that policy was reduced to 0), but I was able to get my treatment.

Citing case and death rates is not a ‚Äòstatistically valid‚Äô way of looking at data?  Gonna have to disagree with you there.


If you‚Äôre going to bring up climate, then you‚Äôre going to also have to acknowledge that FL has one of the highest average ages (6th, 42.5yrs) and the second highest percentage of over-65 residents (20.5%) in the country.  Age has proven to be one of THE highest risk factors for CV complications.  So why, then, was the death rate below the national average?


If you want to talk about mask efficacy, I can also point you to many studies that do not show they are significantly effective on CV transmission.  The truth is that FL has maintained an extraordinary amount of normalcy throughout the past 14 months while also having some of the least restrictive CV measures in place.  You cannot, in good faith, argue that fact.

&gt;Offer guidance about masks and closures instead of fighting the CDC at every turn. 

Such guidance was the responsibility of each state.  Has that changed under Biden?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Actually used the Defense Production act to increase PPE and vaccine supply

The Defense Production act has been used since march of last year to ramp up PPE.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; as opposed to enriching companies that had nothing to do with it. 

What companies were enriched that had nothing to do with it?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ordered enough vaccine to actually vaccinate the population instead of just until the election.

There weren't any vaccinations happening prior to the election.  What does this even mean?  Trump secured enough vaccinations for a large amount of the population with agreements to purchase more at a later day.  Seriously, do you even know what Operation Warp Speed was?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Reimburse states National Guards purchases of PPE, up to the beginning of the pandemic since the previous admin didn't. 

States received such funding under the cares act.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Established pandemic testing board to expand US testing, 

Again, this was under the cares act.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;instead of ignoring and downplaying the bed for testing like the previous administration. 

How did the prior administration downplay testing?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Executive order to enhance collection and analysis of pandemic data instead of sweeping it under the rug. 

What data was swept under the rug?  What are you even referring to here?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Made OSHA create pandemic guidelines and actually enforce them, 

Dont such  guidelines already exist at the state level?  Why then does there need to be a national guideline?

How would the federal government actually enforce a state level guidance?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;as opposed to the previous admin stance of defending companies who forced workers into unsafe conditions. 

How did the administration force anyone into working in unsafe conditions?

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Prevented previous admins withdrawal from WHO.

What's the difference between closed door influence from government officials at private media corporations and transparent employment of government officials within the publicly funded government media?

Let me put it like this, as an example, I know plenty of journalists want to discuss Julian Assange in the USA mass media. Why don't they? Higher ups with established connections with government officials don't want to ruin those relationships, so they don't allow certain stories to air. Is this corruption? Is this freedom?

Of course it's not, but we still get to make the claim of free media despite it being demonstrably false. Independent journalism may exist, but what percentage of the population reads or cares about it? Not much, it's effectively irrelevant in the grand scheme of public influence in this country.

It's the same story, different playbook. The government exerts influence just like the Chinese government does but without mandating party members being transparently employed. Instead, behind closed doors with higher ups, the government simply stops giving them information and scoops. Instead, they give them to competitors who comply with requests. This has double benefit of government being able to propagate information that could contain twisted truths.

Do you think CNN or Fox would be able to operate if they went against the wishes of the parties that support them? Unlikely to end well for them.

Government may have a lesser degree of *direct* influence in the USA media, but we have a propaganda machine that rivals the CCP for sure. 100%, no doubt in my mind. The government is heavily involved with our media, and what really sucks about it is that they seem to be involved in all of the bad ways and none of the good ways.

Why would anyone get the vaccine if they‚Äôre being told: ‚ÄúCovid is no worse than the flu,

You mean downplaying the virus like Pelosi did  in Chinatown SF or when Biden said trumps travel ban was an overreaction and xenophobic?   

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; we are ready to reopen everything and have been for a while thanks to our great handling of the pandemic, the risk is very low to people, masks are unnecessary, the opposition party is blowing everything out of proportion.‚Äù

Data now shows that shutting down economies were the wrong move and all the mask mandates and social distancing did nothing to prevent the spread of the virus.  Compare states with no or lesser restrictions to those with with mandates and greater restrictions.  No difference whatsoever!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\~ Add to that a failure to reassure the public and scientifically address concerns about the vaccine‚Äôs safety,

How di the prior administration do that? Any are you ignoring the current administration's reluctance to follow the science that has been around for months now that prove vaccinated individuals do not need to wear a mask?  How is that reassuring the public where the administration still forces policies that contradict actual science as to the effectiveness of the vaccine?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; the previous party casting doubt over the need for vaccines,

The same administration that created operations Wharp speed with a goal to get a vaccin to the public in uder a year somehow casted doubt on the need for a vaccine?

Are you just making shit up right now hoping to not get called out on it?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; and Trump downplaying his own covid infection 

So, you prefer the president of the US to get hysterical and over hype him getting covid despite being vaccinated?  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;followed by his very low profile receipt of the vaccine himself. Compare this with the high profile vaccinations in the new administration.

so, is your issue with how the media covered each administration getting vaccinated?  Seriously, what are you even complaining about here?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\~ The previous administration had not secured enough vaccines for the entire population.

They reserved more vaccines than the populations of the US.  Thats why there will be a surplus of the vaccine.  Youre literally talking out of your ass right now.  The US secured by far more vaccines per capita than any other country.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I understand that this is often based on production and availability but there was an opportunity to procure additional vaccines in December and this was rejected. 

What are you referring to?  Please be specific.

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;At a very basic level the Biden administration secured enough vaccines for every US resident to be vaccinated, Trump didn‚Äôt.

This is false.  See above.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\~ While it‚Äôs not true that the Trump administration had no plan at all, it took a more hands off approach allowing states more responsibility for their own vaccine distribution. I understand (I think) that many Americans dislike government overreach and prefer states to have autonomy however this resulted in a more disjointed roll out.

But the Biden administration is following the exact same roll out plan the trump administration did.  States are largely overseeing the rollouts.  

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; There‚Äôs a time and a place to sit back and let states handle issues and a pandemic is not it. This seems to be part of Trump‚Äôs larger strategy of taking credit for top level progress while blaming the bungled details on state governors he didn‚Äôt agree with politically.

Ok, I already pointed out the roll out has not changed and is still being handled by the states.  Can you provide anything suggesting that is not the case?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\~ The current administration is taking a more hands on approach

How has it taken a more hands on approach?

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; and has directly arranged for vaccines to be delivered to large scale pharmacies and medical facilities itself.

Can you show me what it is youre referring to here?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\~ Biden administration also allocated resources and support to mass vaccination sites opening up (you can see that many of these began to open in March) and for training vaccinators.

These resources has already been allocated under the Cares Act.  Are you referring to additional allocations under Bidens coronavirus relief package?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\~ Of course it‚Äôs hardly surprising there will be a phased rollout of vaccines which will gradually increase in time‚Äî

The phased roll out was already happening.  The US was administering a million vaccines per day prior to Biden taking office.

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;part of this is hindered by actual vaccine production capacity. To speed this up, the Biden administration facilitated the agreement between competitors Merck and J&amp;J, which will enable Merck to produce the vaccine.

These pharmaceutical companies had already agreed to wave patent restrictions so other companies could produce the vaccine.  THat had nothing to do with Biden.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The government is also allocated resources to help Merck repurpose its facilities to do so.

So, more funding similar to Trumps Operation Warp speed?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I saw in another comment you said that the Biden administration has been criticised on many occasions for going against the science on covid. Would you care to share some examples?

Allowing teachers unions to draft policy for school reopening.

Not true at all. In Denmark regular shops reopened in late February. Bars and restaurants in April. Norway has had many strict measures Denmark never had and has generally been more careful when removing restrictions. 


&gt;So it really doesn't make sense to me to use Denmark and Norway as controls against Sweden, when Norway and Denmark had different responses in terms of restrictions and timing (and figures of cases and deaths for that matter).

Denmark and Norway has had very comparable reactions to the pandemic. Norway has had more travel restrictions and local shutdowns, Denmark more testing. They shut down at the same time in March 2020 and has generally used most of the same tools. Norway managed to not get a second wave in December, but saw a rise in early spring as Denmark came out of the winter shut down. 

Ask yourself why Sweden is the only Nordic country not amongst the bottom 5 in Europe regarding Covid deaths per capita.

It‚Äôs likely Iceland, Norway and Finland has had an easier time controlling the virus than Sweden because of population density, size of cities and fewer connections to the rest of the world. For Denmark though the opposite is true.

No, they're not socially distancing. Cats come into close proximity to other cats for a variety of reasons. For example, mating, territorial disputes or raising their young. In lions they also form prides and in Tigers are even known to share food with other tigers on rare occasions. As for our beloved domestic felines, there are so many that, in most regions, a cat who goes outdoors will find it difficult to avoid other cats.

And that's just proximity to each other. With humans... well... many cat owners will tell you about how difficult it is to use a computer, play video games or read books because cat. They don't exactly understand personal space or social distancing. For the cats who are not our beloved domestic felines they can live in close proximity to humans too. Zoos, sanctuaries and temples are places we've set up where close interactions can occur. The wild ones don't usually respect social distancing while mauling us to death either. A couple of coughs and splutters while having our jugular torn out could spread it.

I feel like you're confusing being solitary animals and socially distancing. When we're socially distanced all our wants and needs occur at a distance and/or with a barrier. Shopping, eating, sleeping, shitting, fucking, all of it.The only exceptions may be other household members we live with. Cats may be solitary animals but they're not fucking through a glory hole and aren't making a conscious effort to stay distanced from all animals who may also contract COVID. 

I agree with the overall idea that cats probably aren't going to be spreading existing strains back to us fast enough to be a threat. But that's not the threat anyone here has been worried about. The threat is new strains evolving in other animals that then reinfect humans. And *that* only needs to spread among an isolated or semi-isolated group for a few generations. For example, if humans are vaccinated but COVID continues to spread in our domestic felines new strains can develop that we're not accustomed to. This is how we got Bird Flu and if my cat can catch and spread cat flu then she's not socially distancing enough to avoid COVID.",,,1621421140,{},gyoinho,False,t3_nf9fum,False,False,t1_gyo6hxp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nf9fum/several_states_report_zero_covid_deaths_for_the/gyoinho/,1621488946,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Among the newly-detected local cases, Bac Giang recorded the highest at 78, Bac Ninh (21), Dien Bien (6), Da Nang (2), Ho Chi Minh City (1), K Hospital's Tan Trieu facility (1).  
  
Furthermore,  two imported cases were also confirmed by the Ministry of Health, raising the total imported infections in the nation to 1,473.  
  
Earlier the same day the Ministry of Health also reported the detection of 30 positive cases in the morning and 36 at noon.  
  
The new cases therefore raise the national tally to 4,690, with a total of 1,647 cases being detected since the fourth COVID-19 wave hit the country on April 27.  
  
The MoH‚Äôs Medical Examination Administration also reports that among the active patients currently undergoing treatment, as many as 89 have since tested negative for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 at least once, with many testing negative several times.  
  
Among the total figure, 2,687 patients have now been declared to be free of the virus, while the fatality count relating to COVID-19 now stands at 37.  
  
Furthermore, amid a rising number of positive COVID-19 cases in Bac Ninh and Bac Giang, the nation‚Äôs current hotspots, military forces are in the process of urgently setting up two temporary hospitals in order to provide care for COVID-19 patients. This will provide some relief to the two localities hit hardest by the pandemic since the virus reemerged in the nation in late April.  
  
Each location will hold 300 beds and can accommodate up to 120 medical workers, with the capacity being raised to 500 beds if necessary.

The administration came under fire whenit admittedly was allowing the teachers Union dictate school reopenings instead of following the science.

This may be true but I'm not sure it's the leading factor here. From what I can see in the US there's no more hesitancy from sincere concern about the science than here in Canada. But there is a large portion that stems from some sort of ideological battleground. Best I can surmise the recent US election and political tensions sucked vaccination in as a battleground issue.  

For example my father who is pretty far-right, Rebel News (Canada equivalent of Fox News) reading conservative got his vaccine day one. I'm 100% sure if we were American he wouldn't have. His ideological world would have convinced him that it was a factor in whatever culture war goes on in his head. But up here you simply don't see the topic come up in terms of political discourse. Don't worry we have lots of other things brewing, one of our political parties is still debating internally whether or not climate change is real, we're just all on the same page with vaccines.

People don't act 100% in-line with science all the time though.  We've been wearing masks for over a year now under constant threat of a virus.  Some people may want a bit more of a readjustment period to no longer wearing masks.  Gradually easing up the mask-wearing over the course of a month or so could help people get comfortable again.

Personally, I don't have any concern with it.  My mom thinks this way a bit though, in-part because our Grandpa died a few weeks ago while having Covid.  We don't know for sure if it was the main reason for his death, because his dementia was quite bad and it was difficult to tell what symptoms he was actually having.  He was also vaccinated with J&amp;J about 10 days prior to getting it.

The immunity induced by Chinese firm Sinopharm‚Äôs Covid-19 vaccine has been brought into question after the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain said they would provide booster shots to people who completed the two-dose regimen six months ago.

Some experts say the offer suggests the vaccine is producing a weak immune response, which can be boosted, but better with a different product, rather than a third dose of the same one.

‚ÄúAs part of the UAE‚Äôs proactive strategy to provide maximum protection for society, an additional supportive dose of Sinopharm is now available for people who have received the vaccine previously and who have completed more than six months since the second dose,‚Äù the UAE‚Äôs National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority said on Tuesday.

‚ÄúThe priority to receive an additional dose of Sinopharm is for the senior citizens and people with chronic diseases,‚Äù it said.

Bahrain issued a similar statement soon after, saying booster shots would be given to recipients of the Sinopharm jabs, starting with priority groups.

The Chinese vaccine, which has a 79 per cent efficacy rate, has been licensed for emergency use by the World Health Organization, which demands Covid-19 vaccines offer an efficacy rate of at least 50 per cent and provide immunity for at least six months. Sinopharm said in a statement earlier this month that more than 200 million doses of its product had been administered globally.

‚ÄúIt is a concern that these inactivated vaccines appear to have very weak immunogenicity such that they need a third dose just six months after the second dose is given,‚Äù said Nikolai Petrovsky, a vaccine developer and professor at Flinders University in Australia, adding that the problem might stem from the small amount of spike protein that inactivated vaccines contain or a weaker kind of adjuvant used to boost the vaccine‚Äôs performance.",,,1621436250,{},gypcha5,True,t3_ng81ul,False,True,t3_ng81ul,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ng81ul/immunity_induced_by_sinopharm_jab_questioned/gypcha5/,1621505250,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Ambassadors from the 27 member states reached consensus at a meeting on Wednesday, endorsing a proposal by the European Commission, which will see the bloc reopen its borders to tourists and other travelers more freely after being largely inaccessible for over a year.

The list of safe countries based on epidemiological criteria will be finalized on Friday, and the new measures could go into effect as early as next week, according to European officials involved in the process. The president of the European Commission had previewed the measures in an interview with The New York Times in April.

The bloc will accept visitors who have received full immunization using one of the shots approved by its own regulator or by the World Health Organization. That covers the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca and Sinopharm vaccines. This would open the door to Americans, who have been receiving shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson.

Some experts recently cautioned that restarting international tourism could be premature.

Dr. Sarah Fortune, the chair of the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said that reopening areas to vaccinated tourists was a calculated risk.

‚ÄúMy doomsday scenario,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúis a mixing of vaccinated and unvaccinated populations in a setting where there is high viral load and high viral transmission.‚Äù

Countries like Greece, Iceland and Croatia had opened to tourists from the United States and other countries before the bloc‚Äôs announcement.

Greece, where hospitality and tourism make up a large portion of the economy, was especially intent on reopening. Incoming tourists have to be vaccinated or present a negative PCR test taken up to 72 hours before their arrival, but they do not have to quarantine.

‚ÄúUnfortunately, after more than 10 years of economic hardship, tourism and food is our only industry,‚Äù said Kostas Tzilialis, a co-owner and co-worker at a cafe and bookshop in Athens. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt produce cars or machines. So we have to open our industry right now. Let‚Äôs hope that people will be careful and the vaccines will protect us.‚Äù

European Union member states will retain the freedom to tweak these measures if they want to take a more conservative approach, meaning that some European countries could retain demands for negative PCR tests or quarantines for certain visitors.

The bloc will also maintain an emergency-brake option, a legal tool that will allow it to quickly snap back to more restrictive travel conditions if a threatening new variant or other Covid emergency emerges.",,,1621441544,{},gyppbvn,False,t3_ng2z15,False,False,t1_gypo5va,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ng2z15/eu_agrees_to_reopen_to_vaccinated_visitors_and/gyppbvn/,1621512897,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Has a weirdly negative spin on the data considering the contents, but tl;dr leaked internal documents from the CCP, shows regular levels of incompetence and sub-optimal practises that were common for covid at the time, but not really anything paticularly malicious. 

""However, though the documents provide no evidence of a deliberate attempt to obfuscate findings, they do reveal numerous inconsistencies in what authorities believed to be happening and what was revealed to the public.""

""The documents, which cover an incomplete period between October 2019 and April this year, reveal what appears to be an inflexible health care system constrained by top-down bureaucracy and rigid procedures that were ill-equipped to deal with the emerging crisis. At several critical moments in the early phase of the pandemic, the documents show evidence of clear missteps and point to a pattern of institutional failings.""

""Conversely, however, the leaked documents also provide something of a defense of China's overall handling of the virus. The reports show that in the early stages of the pandemic, China faced the same problems of accounting, testing, and diagnosis that still haunt many Western democracies even now -- issues compounded by Hubei encountering an entirely new virus.""

There has been ample data showing it effective as a therapeutic treatment

So, now you're in support of policy that contradicts science?  How exactly do you ensure those not wearing mask are vaccinated and if youre vaccinated why does it matter?

https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/mucormycosis/index.html

&gt;Mucormycetes, the group of fungi that cause mucormycosis, are present throughout the environment, particularly in soil and in association with decaying organic matter, such as leaves, compost piles, and animal dung. 1  They are more common in soil than in air, and in summer and fall than in winter or spring. 2-4 Most people come in contact with microscopic fungal spores every day, so it‚Äôs probably impossible to completely avoid coming in contact with mucormycetes. These fungi aren‚Äôt harmful to most people. However, for people who have weakened immune systems, breathing in mucormycete spores can cause an infection in the lungs or sinuses which can spread to other parts of the body.",,,1621432547,{},gyp3rk8,False,t3_ng29so,False,False,t1_gyp1few,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ng29so/black_fungus_infection_declared_an_epidemic_in/gyp3rk8/,1621500404,142,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,

But we know that millions can't and supply in many areas of my state did not meet that demand. So technically in my state we are not even at the mark of 2 weeks after second dose.

So while maybe other places did better, there are many willing participants that are still waiting to be fully vaccinated. So this is putting those people at risk as well, not just those being willfully ignorant. Which is why I said in my previous comment about 2 more weeks. For my state, that is the 6 weeks past open vaccines time frame. Which coincides directly with guidance on what constitutes fully vaccinated.

So, millions of people that have had the vaccine and are now pregnant, that apparently is not evidence. But 2 friends with covid babies, is apparently a hard data set.

I think a lot of those people are in the ""I'll wait a year"" time frame. Realistically, since vaccines started in December and it's only May, technically I suppose no babies have been born yet after being conceived after vaccination.

I agree though, that these arguments are illogical. But I think there will be a lot less hesitation once fda comments on these things.

&gt; I can‚Äôt move on from the pandemic until mask are done. I‚Äôm young, single, and have barely any social circle. Things that I would like to do to move on with my life include such things like eating in a crowded restaurant. I can‚Äôt reasonably justify both masking in a building as a necessary precaution to protect others and then go sit down and eat in close proximity to others with my mask off and insist that is okay.
I remember in the beginning of the pandemic we were all told to just stay home, that if you must go out for your groceries to wear a mask. The mask was intended as an emergency tool to protect others when staying home was not an option. But really, you should stay home. Somehow that got warped into resuming a lite, watered down version of a lot of old activities while wearing mask. But every time I‚Äôm out in public, with mask on, I always have that guilt inside of me, that what I‚Äôm doing isn‚Äôt essential and I should be home. That other people are wearing a mask because my very presence is endangering them.
Fortunately the data from the vaccine results blew my expectations away. For months I supported vaccinated people masking up as a form of solidarity with unvaccinated people, but that was when we had supply constraints. We don‚Äôt have those anymore. With vaccine demand dropping, I find it infuriating that people are spending energy trying to convince vaccinated people to wear mask instead of trying to get unvaccinated people to get the shots.
I know I‚Äôm not a significant risk to others anymore, I know others aren‚Äôt a risk to me. I‚Äôm not going to do something like wear a mask in front of a hostess and then eat maskless in front of a waiter, the hypocrisy would drive me insane. I‚Äôd feel like I still need to stay home. But if I understand how effective the vaccine is and how widespread it is available, I should theoretically be able to resume maskless life and pursue activities without guilt.

The pandemic was a traumatic event and I‚Äôll be living that until old life completely resumes, and that includes mask. With mask around, I can‚Äôt move on from the event. Obviously I won‚Äôt judge others for wearing mask, everyone has different needs to get through this, but even doing something like socializing with my family with my mask on makes me feel guilty, that I shouldn‚Äôt be seeing them at all. If an activity is so dangerous to the point you need a mask, you shouldn‚Äôt be doing it, that‚Äôs why in the beginning of the pandemic it was seen as an emergency tool to use while you did your grocery shopping.",,,1621453960,{},gyqiurq,False,t3_ng6cux,False,False,t1_gyqgzc1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ng6cux/people_are_misinterpreting_the_updated_us_cdc/gyqiurq/,1621532112,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The direct comparison between states, without accounting for demographic differences, weather, social practices, timing of infections, availability of masks, and a whole host of other variables that make direct comparison difficult is invalid. New York, for instance, got hit before they knew they were hit and the virus washed over them before ANYONE had masks on... they brought cases down by taking measures. Florida didn't get hit until much later, once we knew how to prevent spread, and in fact DeSantis had to back track his approach of ignoring the virus once cases spiked there. That was an unforced error. Florida could have taken precautions before cases spiked and saved thousands of lives.

Unless you're a trained epidemiologist, I don't really care if you disagree. You're citing some pretty poorly powered studies with weak statistical relevance as evidence that they don't work, but the scientific community, and most importantly, the people who study epidemiology, believe the evidence that masks slow the spread of the disease. Frankly, you can see this in the models of disease transmission and the change in trajectory of the disease change after lockdowns and masking became more prevalent.

That being said, as a country, we'll probably pass you on total population with at least one dose tomorrow. As a country we are still supply constrained, we have solid bookings for vaccines in my province (Ontario) into June, and we are still prioritizing first doses. By this time next week, we will have a few percent points on you in total population with at least one dose, and I don't think we'll slow down until we hit around... 70%? Of the **total** population with one dose, which will probably be in about 2 1/2 weeks. 

Maybe the fact that supply is still constrained here is having a positive effect on our desire for the vaccine, but polling shows over 80% of our population is willing, which is fantastic because even the most conservative estimates for the requirement of herd immunity has it around 80.

 In the past I read the studies, and critiques and trials and followed the science. Since I am vaccinated I do not follow them anymore. But I recall I felt more confidence by drawing my own conclusions from reading source studies than relying on CDC

So to me natural to feel just a tiny bit of unease, given track record of government messaging.

Something I find interesting is how little the mask mandate seems to make an impact on these projections. Here's the PA projections for daily COVID cases:

* June 2021: 1628 projected cases, 1033 with a universal mask mandate and 2880 with returning to pre-COVID behaviors 
* July 2021: 433 projected cases, 151 with a universal mask mandate and 1535 with returning to pre-COVID behaviors
* August 2021: 238 projected cases, 36 with a universal mask mandate and 995 with returning to pre-COVID behaviors
* September 2021: 309 projected cases, 19 with a universal mask mandate and 1011 with returning to pre-COVID behaviors

It's kinda hard to take the ""we can't open up right now!"" talk seriously when there's such a small difference with the projections.

I don't even know why you're asking me this question. Like... our CDC has had some of the worst guidance since the beginning of the pandemic.

And it does not seem to matter which side is appointing the director. Our guidance is some of the worst we've seen comparatively. It remains so. There are several public health experts that continue to criticize the CDC's policies on testing and sequencing breakthrough cases... or the lack thereof. 

Canada's CDC, for example, has mask layering instructions and ""winter weather"" advice for mask efficacy. China's CDC recommended airline staff wear diapers because they determined airplane restrooms has the highest rate of transmission.

The CDC lays out guidelines and many institutions follow those guidelines. They have a responsibility to ensure that those guidelines are geared towards public safety in a way that's effective and easy to understand.

Do you think they've done that?

The 1st wave was always going to be the worst and the lack of testing and basic supplies made the situation much worse in these states, allowing covid to spread unchecked in vulnerable communities. Vermont and Maine did not have a huge impact on the 1st wave because they are more rural and restrictions, notably the travel restrictions, were imposed before the outbreaks really reached them. Vermont is actually comparable to western MA in terms of case numbers and deaths- Boston was the hardest hit. These states are also mostly densely populated, with Long Island and NYC making up the bulk of cases and deaths for NY. They all also had to resort to field hospitals at points in the pandemic, meaning patients recieved less care because the medical facilities did get overwhelmed in localized areas.

By the time Florida had its 1st wave, you were already 4 times less likely to die from covid and MATH+ protocols had been created to treat covid (Yale new haven being a huge source of open information for other hospitals and publishing their care protocols daily to reflect changing data for real time updates on what was and wasn't working). The overall death rate is a crappy number to look at because most of the country outside these areas still doesn't understand exactly how bad the situation was because it was being downplayed on a national level. That's also a large reason these areas are very provaccination. Even my conservative family in the northeast didn't fuck around with mask mandates or the vaccine, a stark contrast to my Midwest conservative family members.

My wife and I are in the same boat and are soon to have a third child.  I totally get what you are talking about.  I *DO NOT* want my kids to get Covid-19 for a variety of reasons.  One thing to consider though is the rate of infection and positivity rate in whatever area you are in.  In my area, test positivity rate is now at ~0.5%.  We get my oldest who is now in Kindergarten tested every Friday just in case, and we haven't started letting our kids play with any other families kids, *yet*.   We probably will soon though.  If we can get another family, or set of families that are fully vaccinated with young kids that can't be, and all of us agree to continue being safe with the activities our kids participate in, I think we can maybe bubble up and ensure the safe practices continue until Septemberish when it is expected young kids can experience the wonder that is the vaccines.  

It sucks right now, and feels like Pandemic Jr for our kids if we go back to ""normal"" right now.  For adults with no kids though, I totally understand, and reluctantly agree that they should be able to go, have fun party, and go back to work as normal for the most part, ***as long as they are fully vaccinated***(14 days post their series of 1 or 2 shots here in the US.).

Everyone has a little bit of PTSD from this long bought with a global pandemic.  If they are vaccinated and want to blow off some steam, let them!

Perfectly fine, they're not bothering me in any way, shape, or form; but it has been unreasonable to think that it's NECESSARY outside for a very long time. 

My real guess is that the vast majority recognized that and thus didn't care. If you want to wear it, cool. If not, ok too. It's not like I was running in to Dunkin Donuts screaming at the cashiers. I was walking down 34th ave minding my own business. And I was treated accordingly. 

Anyway, my point was more ""even if someone does give you a dirty look, who cares?"" That's their problem, not mine/yours.

It‚Äôs a matter of protecting yourself and others because this still isn‚Äôt under control.

Why worry about hypotheticals?  There was a thunderstorm where I live last night and there was a chance that my house could have been struck by lightning while I was asleep.  I've had relatives die of COVID, in car accidents, of heart attacks, cancer, fires, etc. over the years.  I'll take reasonable precautions for avoiding any of those things.  However, it doesn't really serve my life to have actual fear of them.  Could a new variant pop up that the vaccines don't work against and cause us to have an even worse time than the past year?  Yes, it's possible, but as of right now there's no reason to think that it will happen.

&gt; I know it's probably irrational, but there's this part of me that doesn't want to start indulging in the liberties of life until I know 110% sure we're really through it. I see people celebrating in the end-zone, but personally I feel like we're still a good 10-20 yards away.

It's not fully irrational.  I'm vaccinated and I can go out unmasked and get lunch with friends at work (who are also all vaccinated.)  That doesn't mean I'll go to a concert at a bar with poor ventilation filled with random strangers yet.  It's a process and it's ok for you, if you're fully vaccinated, to do things at your own pace.  If you have kids or people in your life that can't be vaccinated then it also makes sense for you to have different precautions in place than someone who lives alone and is fully vaccinated.  We're all in this together in some sense but we're all playing the same game on different fields.  Your end zone may be 10 yards away, but your kids' might be 20 yards away, and I might have already been in the end zone for weeks now.

In any case, I think it's fair as long as we adopt something of a live and let live philosophy to a point.  Obviously, don't put up with anyone trying to force you to do risky things you don't want to do, or to endanger the unvaccinated.  However, don't be unhappy with vaccinated people who are doing what the CDC told them they can do either.  At some point, everyone in the country will be eligible for vaccines and the cases will have gone down to where this is further past us.  There's no specific ""pandemic over"" event, it's just going to gradually dwindle down to background noise at some point.",,,1621435547,{},gypasps,False,t3_ng3j7f,False,True,t1_gyp8042,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ng3j7f/back_to_normal_psychologists_warn_the_pandemic/gypasps/,1621504302,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

To be fair, we couldn‚Äôt confirm this until pretty recently, but this is the current understanding. And don‚Äôt take my word for it, do a few searches and you‚Äôll find Fauci and CDC officials saying the same thing.

Your point about children is valid. I do feel for parents of kids that are too young to be vaccinated. But again, all data shows that kids are unlikely to get seriously ill from COVID, to the point that if you‚Äôre looking at the under 18 age group, a kid is much more likely to die in a car crash any given day than they are to die or have a serious case of COVID.

Vaccine hesitant people just aren‚Äôt going to get the vaccine, and we can‚Äôt force them to protect themselves. This is why scientific panels came to the conclusion weeks ago that we may never reach true ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù (by standard definitions). 

Yes, maskless unvaccinated people will increase spread. But who are they going to spread it to? Answer: other unvaccinated people. If you have the vaccine, you‚Äôre not going to be a disease vector whether you mask up or not, and it‚Äôs extremely, extremely unlikely that you become infected with a symptomatic case.

To your point about showing proof of vaccination vs wearing masks inside businesses, my answer is neither. Unvaccinated people should continue to wear masks per CDC guidance, but if they don‚Äôt, then no sweat off my back. They can enjoy the hospital stay for all I care.

At the end of the day, the truth is that these people have had the ability for weeks now to take a simple measure and go out and protect themselves from a once in a century pandemic that has killed millions of people. If they haven‚Äôt taken that measure by now, then maybe they just can‚Äôt be helped.",,,1621435017,{},gyp9j0z,False,t3_nf9dgv,False,True,t1_gyp677p,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nf9dgv/fauci_reasonable_for_businesses_to_keep_masks/gyp9j0z/,1621503594,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Better immunity could be achieved by mixing vaccines that used different technologies, rather than administering a third shot, he said.

‚ÄúIn my experience with other vaccines such as hepatitis B, little benefit can be expected from subsequent boosting so what is needed is a new approach,‚Äù Petrovsky said.

‚ÄúWe will inevitably see more use of mix and match regimens as adenovirus vaccines [the technology behind the Oxford-AstraZeneca product] cannot be used for further boosts due to anti-vector immunity, so a different vaccine, such as recombinant protein will be needed to boost the hundreds of millions who have already been vaccinated with adenovirus vaccines in due course.‚Äù

A Chinese vaccine expert, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the industry had been studying the antibody levels of vaccinated and recovered patients and was working on ways to improve immunisation.

‚ÄúVaccination using different technologies for their advantages is better, but a third dose of an inactivated vaccine is acceptable if no other options are available,‚Äù the person said, adding that the Chinese authorities would arrange ways to boost the immune response in the future if it were needed.

You are right that there is a low rate of reinfection, but the vaccination is expected to provide protection against further infection that's more durable and longer lasting than by contracting the virus (by getting sick, essentially). So that is why it's recommended that even people who have previously been infected with Coronavirus get the vaccine. Per The CDC and other health departments, you don't have to wait 90 days before getting vaccinated.

Getting the COVID-19 vaccine, even with a history of infection, will do a better job of protecting you against re-infection than just a history of infection. You had  mild illness in the past but there's always a possibility that if another course of disease could be more serious (whether just by pure chance or a variant of concern that causes more serious illness) Researchers have measured the quantity and type of antibody produced by both natural and vaccine-induced immunity for covid-19.",,,1621431893,{},gyp29ix,False,t3_nfyp7h,False,False,t1_gyozvwb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nfyp7h/daily_discussion_thread_may_19_2021/gyp29ix/,1621499604,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I can‚Äôt reasonably justify both masking in a building as a necessary precaution to protect others and then go sit down and eat in close proximity to others with my mask off and insist that is okay. 

I remember in the beginning of the pandemic we were all told to just stay home, that if you must go out for your groceries to wear a mask. The mask was intended as an emergency tool to protect others when staying home was not an option. But really, you should stay home. Somehow that got warped into resuming a lite, watered down version of a lot of old activities while wearing mask.

Fortunately the data from the vaccine results blew my expectations away. For months I supported vaccinated people masking up as a form of solidarity with unvaccinated people, but that was when we had supply constraints. We don‚Äôt have those anymore. With vaccine demand dropping, I find it infuriating that people are spending energy trying to convince vaccinated people to wear mask instead of trying to get unvaccinated people to get the shots.

One of my coworkers just in the past two weeks has lost his mother, brother, and is about to lose his sister to Covid in India.  They can't find oxygen or a bed for them.  And he can't go visit them!  All travel from India is currently banned by nearly every country so if he went there's no guarantee he would be able to return within months!  And he's not the only one here in the States that has this problem.  HR has been doing what it can to help but...what can they do?  HR in America can only send condolences and grant time off, but the employees don't want time off because at least at work they're not hyper-focused on how powerless they actually are!

Several who were hospitalized will never return to work because they are physically unable with Long Covid.  And as for their families, there's even more deaths!  We have one particular family where every one of the eight family members except the worker and his mother were killed.  Emotionally he's shattered and we've not heard from him in a week.

No. It was not. See: everything Jared Kushner did.

&gt;Such guidance was the responsibility of each state.  Has that changed under Biden?

While still their responsibility, having a unified national goal and direction in the face of a disease makes a big difference. Same as any other disease. Under the previous admin it was an inefficient patchwork.

&gt;The Defense Production act has been used since march of last year to ramp up PPE.

It was signed. It did not meaningfully ramp up PPE. The admin largely ignored it, and when they did hand out contacts have much of the funding out to companies that had absolutely no resources to produce PPE. It was badly managed.

&gt;What companies were enriched that had nothing to do with it?

Congress Investigates Inexperienced Companies Receiving Government Contracts  https://www.npr.org/2020/07/15/891122225/congress-is-investigating-contracts-tied-to-mask-and-ppe-shortages

&gt;There weren't any vaccinations happening prior to the election.  What does this even mean?  Trump secured enough vaccinations for a large amount of the population with agreements to purchase more at a later day.

The previous admin only cared to make efforts towards securing vaccines before the election. He made little to no efforts afterwards. When companies reached out to inquire about future orders so that the us would have a consistent supply he said no--the current admin had to scramble to fill the back order as well as use the DPA.

&gt;Seriously, do you even know what Operation Warp Speed was?

Do you?

&gt;States received such funding under the cares act.

Not for the entirety of the pandemic, no. And this was specifically for national guard PPE.

&gt;Again, this was under the cares act.

Didn't expand it, that backfilled funding.

&gt;How did the prior administration downplay testing?

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-slow-down-testing-coronavirus-i-dont-kid/

&gt;What data was swept under the rug?  What are you even referring to here?

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/us-coronavirus-data-has-already-disappeared-after-trump-administration-shifted-control-from-cdc-to-hhs.html

&gt;Dont such  guidelines already exist at the state level?  Why then does there need to be a national guideline?
&gt;How would the federal government actually enforce a state level guidance?

Which leaves workers in states with poor guidelines out in the dark. And they enforce them the same way OSHA works for everything else.

&gt;How did the administration force anyone into working in unsafe conditions?

I guess that was more Senate Rs, who were holding up the second relief bill unless immunity from legal action was guaranteed to companies who did that. So fine, the previous admin gets the pass of being totally indifferent here.

&gt;Do you think the WHO did an adequate job identifying to virus outbreak or were hesitant to sound the alarm due to pressure from China?

Do you think leaving the WHO to be entirely dependent on Chinese funding going forward is a smart investment with regards to future pandemics, or a poor one?

Honestly most of this could have been googled.

The CDC acknowledges that a large scale study has not been conducted on pregnant women, but they are collecting information from women who became pregnant after clinical trials in order to better understand whether or not the vaccine may have had some impact on their pregnancy.  

While I can understand women having a ""wait and see"" approach to this, there are many who actively believe that the vaccine IS harmful to their child or the prospect of them having a child.  There is zero significant evidence to that effect.  ""Well my cousin had a miscarriage after she got the vaccine"" does not establish a causal mechanism, but stories like this hold way too much sway over the types of people that are still ""on the fence"".  They have no evidence for their claims, but overcoming their uninformed beliefs is a tall order nonetheless.  

I just feel that the number of people who truly have refrained from cementing their beliefs and are receptive to new information are substantially lower than the number of people who claim to be undecided.  I don't think that any amount of evidence will actually overcome their reticence because their minds are made up (but when polled, they don't want to admit this of course).  The difference between them and me, however, is that I am open to the prospect that I may be wrong, and in this case I hope that I am.

I disagree with that.

I would say that nearly everyone who got the vaccine insisted on overwhelming evidence that there wouldn't be harm. The word overwhelming might be up for interpretation, but the vaccine was proven safe and effective by the FDA before the overwhelming majority of Americans got their first dose. And beyond that, the mRNA vaccines have been under investigation for quite awhile outside of this application.  I think insisting on evidence of safety is very common and reasonable.

Vaccines give waaaay more antibodies than infection, but just for the spike part of the virus. That's the important part. And they're better antibodies from vaccination apparently (just learned that yesterday). And for every other vaccine for every other disease, the antibodies last way longer. 

From an infection you get antibodies for the spike *and* the neucleocapsid. Turns out that the neucleocapsid antibodies can cause issues, and they don't stop the virus from entering your cells. I can find a link if you like.

[],,EveAndTheSnake,,,[],,,,text,t2_cs264,False,False,[],"~ Changed narrative, actively encouraging people to get vaccinated without downplaying the negative impact of the pandemic because it looks bad, approaching the situation with less ego. Why would anyone get the vaccine if they‚Äôre being told: ‚ÄúCovid is no worse than the flu, we are ready to reopen everything and have been for a while thanks to our great handling of the pandemic, the risk is very low to people, masks are unnecessary, the opposition party is blowing everything out of proportion.‚Äù

~ Add to that a failure to reassure the public and scientifically address concerns about the vaccine‚Äôs safety, the previous party casting doubt over the need for vaccines, and Trump downplaying his own covid infection followed by his very low profile receipt of the vaccine himself. Compare this with the high profile vaccinations in the new administration. 

~ The previous administration had not secured enough vaccines for the entire population. I understand that this is often based on production and availability but there was an opportunity to procure additional vaccines in December and this was rejected. **At a very basic level the Biden administration secured enough vaccines for every US resident to be vaccinated, Trump didn‚Äôt.**

~ While it‚Äôs not true that the Trump administration had *no plan at all*, it took a more hands off approach allowing states more responsibility for their own vaccine distribution. I understand (I think) that many Americans dislike government overreach and prefer states to have autonomy however this resulted in a more disjointed roll out. There‚Äôs a time and a place to sit back and let states handle issues and a pandemic is not it. This seems to be part of Trump‚Äôs larger strategy of taking credit for top level progress while blaming the bungled details on state governors he didn‚Äôt agree with politically. 

~ The current administration is taking a more hands on approach and has directly arranged for vaccines to be delivered to large scale pharmacies and medical facilities itself. 

~ Biden administration also allocated resources and support to mass vaccination sites opening up (you can see that many of these began to open in March) and for training vaccinators. 

~ Of course it‚Äôs hardly surprising there will be a phased rollout of vaccines which will gradually increase in time‚Äîpart of this is hindered by actual vaccine production capacity. To speed this up, the Biden administration facilitated the agreement between competitors Merck and J&amp;J, which will enable Merck to produce the vaccine. The government is also allocated resources to help Merck repurpose its facilities to do so.
