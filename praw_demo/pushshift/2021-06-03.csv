Let's call the position that though masks might be effective when worn by a medical professional they probably won't be for the general public and a better strategy is encouraging the symptomatic to stay home the ""masks don't work"" position.  And let's call the position that masks are an effective public health measure and should therefore be mandated in America's public spaces the ""masks work"" position.  Each of those is a gross oversimplification, but we have to simplify to talk about this.

Fauci said masks don't work.  He said this in a variety of ways in public at the time but was always slightly vague, but in one of these emails he was explicit.

Later he said masks work.

Therefore, when he said that masks don't work, he was telling the truth, but when he said that masks work, he was lying in service of an undefined criminal conspiracy for which masks were an important part of the master plan.  Insert your favorite conspiracy theory here.

Of course, over here in the real world, Fauci said that masks don't work because medical science said they didn't, and then he said they did because new studies came out about asymptomatic spread and changed what we knew.  You can read the various studies yourself.  Of course, all the doctors and researchers could also be part of the conspiracy.

India has the largest vaccine production facility in the world, and it was being used to export primarily to the United States in 2020, despite their increasing covid19 cases.

Now, India is a hotbed for Covid deaths and tragedy. What has our greed accomplished? Sure, more of us are safe, but I think it is safe to assume that those with common sense would have remained safe if we were to have allowed India to keep a portion of its vaccines for its own citizens, no? At the very least, it would have prevented far more deaths in such a densely populated country.

Over 60m doses of viable vaccines were diverted from India to the US and elsewhere in 2020. To note, they manufactured the Covax, Novavax, and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine (the latter of which I got before it was pulled and reinstated). They also had a deal with AstraZeneca but that deal left them out of keeping vaccines as well. Less than 1/10 people have been able to receive one dose of the vaccine in India due to this disparity and demand from the US and other countries--this has not changed much since last year.

Now, we sit and await an end to restrictions, (this is a generalized statement and I'm not saying everyone here is acting careless) meanwhile we lament those who are dying by the tens of thousands around the globe, despite also exacerbating that same issue for them. 

I genuinely think that in this case the US was selfish.

If you have any food that you bought last year for Covid lockdown/emergencies/etc., now is the time to eat it or donate it to a food pantry. If it's expired, eat it or toss it instead of donating it please.  If you want to be prepared for future emergencies, go ahead and buy more to replace it, I guess.

If you're an American and you've been waiting for your turn to get vaccinated, it's your turn.

If you are vaccinated, it's your turn to help other people get vaccinated. 

If you have a strategy to get older Americans vaccinated, please spread the word. 

I think we need to get to the point where we can get hospitals back to normal operation and get family doctors/GP's doses to give out like they do with the flu vaccine. And like tons of extra doses. Novavax should help here.

The vaccines are FREE in the US.  FREE FREE, not like ""Copay free"", like fuckin FREE.  Go get one. Now.  Is there something stopping you from going to get one today? Talk to me about it, we'll get it worked out.

Walensky, the C.D.C. director, cited two recent scientific findings as significant factors: Few vaccinated people become infected with the virus, and transmission seems rarer still; and the vaccines appear to be effective against all known variants of the coronavirus. 

Remember, if you got infected, recovered, and then got at least one dose of Pfizer, you have immunity not only to multiple variants, but also SARS-CoV-1, the virus for which we named SARS in 2003.

The effort, which began on June 1, joins a growing number of countries that are launching programs to make the inoculations available to the maritime community.

The vaccination program for seafarers started in the presence of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice and the North Sea, Vincent Van Quickenborne. The vaccinations are currently taking place in the Port of Antwerp and will also begin in the Port of Zeebrugge in the coming days. The goal is to vaccinate approximately 2,200 seafarers this month.

“Seafarers are important to our economy, with 90 percent of what we consume arrive by sea. At the same time, seafarers live at sea in closed groups for a long time, which can be dangerous should there be a corona outbreak onboard,” said Minister Van Quickenborne. “With a vaccine, we are not only offering Belgian seafarers the security to work in those unique circumstances but also the ability to travel safely and smoothly to foreign ports. Belgium is the first country in Europe to vaccinate seafarers. In this way, we can guarantee the continuous operation of shipping.

”Dr. Rob Verbist, the General Practitioner of Mediport, who is overseeing the program in the Port of Antwerp explained that seafarers 41 years and older are receiving the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. He said this is the most practical for their working situation. Younger persons will be receiving the Pfizer vaccine, and they will have to return to the port within five weeks for their second shot.

This month, the Netherlands also will start a program to vaccinate all seafarers working on Dutch ships, regardless of the seafarer’s nationality. The Netherlands said approximately 49,000 single-dose vaccines would be made available to seafarers. The program will be spread over months so far to make it possible for seafarers to receive their inoculations during leave or to travel home or to a ship.

Efforts are also continuing at major ports around the United States. Locally organized they were providing vaccinations to seafarers on ships calling at the ports or in clinics set up in the ports. On June 2, Federal Maritime Commissioner Louis Sola also sent a letter to the governors of California, Maryland, New York, and Washington states urged their states to vaccinate seafarers working on cruise ships as the cruise industry prepares to restart. Sola said it would help to support efforts to restart the economy and support building back the tourism industry.

Despite the increasing efforts, the results of an ongoing survey previewed yesterday by The Bahamas Maritime Authority found that the vast majority, 87 percent, of seafarers are still to receive a vaccine. Of the respondents to The Seafarer COVID-19 Welfare Survey, BMA said 86 percent reported that they would be willing to have the vaccine if it was offered to them and 65 percent of seafarers said they would feel safer if they had been vaccinated. Initial results also show that more than half of those who have been at sea during the pandemic have been impacted in terms of shore leave and ability to get on or off a vessel.",,,1622799190,{},h0jqswu,True,t3_ns1179,False,True,t3_ns1179,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ns1179/belgium_starts_eus_first_seafarer_covid/h0jqswu/,1622935523,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The best book I've read on the subject is [10% Human](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23644794-10-human) by Alana Collen. Highly recommend it.

One of the most interesting things I learned is that the appendix is now theorised to be a bacterial 'safe house' that may serve to repopulate the gut after a devastating event (such as a course of antibiotics, which kill bacteria indiscriminately.)

We can talk about vaccine equality forever, but no one has had the level of death of the US, not even India.

The vaccines were needed in the US first, this was the emergency location when the vaccines were finally approved, I don’t think you remember that.

And now that it’s not the emergency location we are sending out doses, for free, to the new emergency locations.

We spend billions on Global Health, more than anyone and you act as if we are the bad guy here. 

You said India kept no vaccines for itself, but that’s just not true, they kept the homegrown vaccines, and they kept plenty of other varieties too because people are scrambling to get the western vaccines. And again, if India, the worlds leading vaccine manufacturer, cannot make an effective vaccine, nor make enough vaccine even with its manufacturing power and educated workers force, there’s no way any other country can do so in any revenant time line with just a patent release. That’s just not possible.

And nowhere near 98% of the UK or 90% of the US has been vaccinated with one dose, not even close.

Maybe that’s your issue, you think we are swimming in vaccinated people here in the US. But even if we gave out our vaccines equally (we didnt, most of those 292m vaccines were doubled up) we still wouldn’t hit 90% of our population, and again, the emergency was in the US when these vaccines were approved, and even today the US death rate per capita is just 20% off from India’s so it’s not like we are out of the woods yet and sitting on vaccine for fun.",,,1622807616,{},h0k29kx,False,t3_nrfuyw,False,True,t1_h0iyvoz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nrfuyw/bidenharris_administration_unveils_strategy_for/h0k29kx/,1622942394,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Taiwan is battling a spike in domestic infections and has vaccinated only about 3% of its population. Japan has agreed to procure more than 300 million doses of coronavirus vaccines from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) and AstraZeneca, more than enough to cover its entire population.

""At the time of the great east Japan earthquake 10 years ago, people in Taiwan sent us a lot of donations quickly. I believe that is etched vividly in the minds of Japanese people,"" Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said, announcing the vaccine donation. ""Such an important partnership and friendship with Taiwan is reflected in this offer.""

The vaccines landed at Taipei's main international airport early in the afternoon. Taiwan Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said he was ""extremely thankful"" the shots had arrived at a tense moment in the island's fight against the pandemic, as he reported another 472 new infections.

""I believe it will be very helpful in overall pandemic prevention,"" he added.

The donation is a triumph for Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who has faced public anger about the slow arrival of vaccines and small protests by the main opposition party, the Kuomintang, outside her offices.

In a live online broadcast from her office, Tsai called on people to understand that it was not only Taiwan facing challenges getting vaccines now, with global supplies tight.
""Taiwan's international situation is very difficult. Even before vaccines are loaded onto the aircraft, there may be variables.""

China, which claims the island as its own territory, has offered vaccines, but Taiwan has repeatedly expressed concern about their safety and accused China of trying to block Taiwan's vaccine purchases internationally.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters in Beijing that despite China's goodwill offer of shots, Taiwan had ""lied that the mainland obstructed the provision of vaccines"" to the island.
""The Taiwan authorities for their own selfish political gains have engaged in political manipulation on vaccine issues,"" he added.

Though Taiwan's share has not been announced, the island will also get shots under a White House plan for the United States to share 25 million surplus COVID-19 vaccine doses with the world.

Taiwan has received only about 860,000 doses so far, mainly AstraZeneca shots, but also a smaller number from Moderna. It has ordered more than 20 million doses from AstraZeneca and Moderna and is also developing its own vaccines.

In an emailed statement to Reuters, Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ.N) said that it had been in ""confidential discussions"" with Taiwan about providing its COVID-19 vaccine to the island since last year, but gave no details.

The J&amp;J vaccine requires a single dose, rather than the two-shot regimen of most other COVID-19 vaccines.

The Sabah state elections in Malaysia were used as an example for our proposed methodology and we investigate the event’s spatial and temporal impacts on COVID-19 transmission. Results indicate an estimated (i) 70.0% of COVID-19 case counts within Sabah post-state election were attributable to the election’s direct effect; (ii) 64.4% of COVID-19 cases in the rest of Malaysia post-state election were attributable to the election’s spill-over effects. Sensitivity analysis was further conducted by examining epidemiological pre-trends, surveillance efforts, varying synthetic control matching characteristics and spill-over specifications. We demonstrate that our estimates are not due to pre-existing epidemiological trends, surveillance efforts, and/or preventive policies. These estimates highlight the potential of mass gatherings in one region to spill-over into an outbreak of national scale. Relaxations of mass gathering restrictions must therefore be carefully considered, even in the context of low community transmission and enforcement of safe distancing guidelines.",,,1622816099,{},h0kime1,True,t3_ns64o1,False,True,t3_ns64o1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ns64o1/estimating_direct_and_spillover_impacts_of/h0kime1/,1622952091,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Not to mention that they decided not to publish half of the studies on it when those studies didn’t show benefit.

&gt; Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), a neuraminidase inhibitor, was approved for seasonal flu by US Food and Drug Administration in 1999. A number of randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analysis emphasized a favorable efficacy and safety profile. Majority of them were funded by Roche, which also first marketed and promoted this drug. In 2005 and 2009, the looming fear of pandemic flu led to recommendation by prominent regulatory bodies such as World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, European Medicines Agency and others for its use in treatment and prophylaxis of influenza, and it's stockpiling as a measure to tide over the crisis. Serious Adverse Events, especially neuropsychiatric events associated with Tamiflu started getting reported leading to a cascade of questions on clinical utility of this drug. A recent Cochrane review and related articles have questioned the risk-benefit ratio of the drug, besides raising doubts about the regulatory decision of approving it. The recommendations for stockpiling the said drug as given by various international organizations viz WHO have also been put to scrutiny. Although many reviewers have labeled the Tamiflu saga as a “costly mistake,” the episode leaves us with some important lessons. This article takes a comprehensive relook on the subject, and we proceed to suggest some ways and means to avoid a similar situation in the future.

[],,girlwriteswhat,,,[],,,,text,t2_50vh1,False,False,[],"&gt;I only get the level of protection that the vaccine I get gives. None of these vaccines protects everybody that gets vaccinated. Pfizer may give over 90% protection - while AstraZeneca reduction in disease transmission may be as low as 67%.

Sure. But the level of protection from hospitalization, ICU admission and death for all of these vaccines approaches 100%. It's not just about not catching it. It's also about having a jumpstart on your immune response if you DO catch it.

COVID is not actually very deadly in and of itself. It's the infectiousness that's the problem. It has a protein that makes it stick to cell membranes, and then a second protein that exploits a specific cell receptor (ACE-2) to get inside. 

By the time your immune system realizes what's going on, it panics. Your macrophages release cytokines to cause an inflammatory response, and then because they're panicking, they mistake the inflammatory response as more infection, and release more cytokines, which creates more inflammation which is mistaken again as more infection, and it becomes a cascading positive feedback loop. 

Anything that prevents that immune overreaction process from starting (ivermectin, HCQ, a vaccine) will prevent the cytokine response from becoming that cascading positive feedback loop known as cytokine storm syndrome.

Even if vaccination doesn't provide perfect protection from infection, it DOES stave off cytokine storm syndrome, the primary mechanism of death from COVID. You might still catch it, but you won't get very sick, because it won't get enough of a foothold to trigger a cytokine storm. At that point, it becomes a cold, or the flu. 

And let's be real here. The case fatality rate is much lower than the official numbers would suggest. 

Every person who's died in the last year or so has been tested for COVID. But not every person who has had it and lived has been tested,.

Again, 6 people in my family have had COVID and lived to tell the tale. Only one was tested for it. If I were to extrapolate that outwards, I'd have to conclude that the case fatality rate is possibly 16% of what the official numbers suggest. Even considering redundant positive tests, we're looking at 50%.

If you're a healthy, non obese person under the age of 60 with no immunosuppressant conditions, this is basically the flu.

And what is the recommendation for the flu shot? Vulnerable people should get it. We don't demand that every single person who can must get the flu shot, because not every single person is vulnerable.

My younger son, 17 at the time, got a rash on his toes. My daughter (24, who had undiagnosed Type1 diabetes at the time) got a bad cold that left her couch-bound for a week. I have asthma and was a 49 year old heavy smoker. I was down for about 5 days. My husband (then 37) with a systemic autoimmune condition was down for 4. My other son (26)? No symptoms at all. My nephew (23)? Lost his sense of taste and smell and felt under the weather for a few weeks.

Go ahead and get your vaccination. More power to you. But even if the vaccination you get is ""only 67% effective at preventing infection"" that doesn't mean you have a 33% chance of dying. Lots more people have survived this than have made it into the official statistics, and your vaccination will prevent you from developing serious illness. 

Is COVID serious? Yes. Should people panic because not everyone is lining up to get the jab? No.",,,1622759350,{},h0hvigd,False,t3_nqm614,False,True,t1_h0fdvf4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nqm614/threequarters_of_adults_in_uk_have_now_had_first/h0hvigd/,1622893071,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Here's where they're at. 

Israel has vaccinated about [80%](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/israel-vaccinated-most-adults-covid-herd-immunity-2021-6%3famp) of their adult population. 

[Palestinians are about 95% unvaccinated.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/as-health-care-workers-we-stand-in-solidarity-with-palestine/). 

And children are unvaccinated, too. 

[Many experts argue that herd immunity will require a vaccination rate of 90% or more.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/health/herd-immunity-covid-coronavirus.amp.html)

Isreali success has largely hinged on containment efforts. For example - they still have a [highly controlled border](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-reopens-borders-small-groups-foreign-tourists-2021-05-23/).  They still have some measures but many were removed [this week. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/world/middleeast/israel-covid-restrictions.amp.html)

The US is not following in Israel's footsteps. We don't have a similar strategy. Israel was a late adopter of the eradication strategy and the US never adopted it. 

The US is already seeing spikes in areas where the variants are spreading. Northern Missouri, for example, is seeing an increase in positivity and hospitalizations. 

[Several states have a positivity rate that is too high. This suggests spread. ](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/states-ranked-by-covid-19-test-positivity-rates-july-14.html)


[Only 10 states saw a decrease from last week. Most states saw no changes. Several are now recording positive case increases. ](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/tracker/overview)

I also think it's important to note the lag time between waves. 

If you remember the lag time between Wuhan and the US - it was several months. Other areas were hit first based on things like the most popular trade routes.  First China, then Europe, UK, and then the US. 

Some of the waves occurred out of order due to things like lockdowns and new variants originating in other countries.",,,1622761468,{},h0hzy09,False,t3_nrnpaf,False,True,t1_h0hrqig,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nrnpaf/sinopharm_doubts_chinas_great_vaccine_hope_sees/h0hzy09/,1622895692,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

How many other people have died of covid related complications - but have had their deaths attributed to other factors - because they died more than 28 days after being Covid free?

&gt;COVID is not actually very deadly in and of itself.

It's killed nearly four million people so far - I would call that deadly!

There are plenty of people ill in hospitals, that got vaccinated - and as covid continues to mutate, and the vaccines becomes less effective, that number is only going to increase!

&gt;If you're a healthy, non obese person under the age of 60 with no immunosuppressant conditions, this is basically the flu.

I wish that were so - but it is not - millions of people have already died of this millions more are going to die, Many many millions of others will have their health destroyed to the point they can no longer live normal lives.

If none of your family died when you caught it, you got lucky - a lot of families did not get lucky, and they lost members. so far four million families suffered a death - there will be many more deaths before this is over, possibly millions more!

Also, may have been misunderstood, my position was, for example:

If we produce x amount of vaccine doses, we would essentially export a fraction of this gross amount abroad. This would allow us to keep 80% of what we produce while still providing at least some flow to the rest of the world and thus begin to establish the vaccine equity that the ACT initiative by the WHO has only begun to put into action (probably doesn't help that we are its primary donor, since there could be more money funding this initiative from elsewhere I am sure). I am not at all saying we should start exporting when we are at 60% of the population vaccinated, because we aren't even at 50% of the country fully vaccinated yet. 

Also, while I am writing this out of order, their homegrown vaccines compared to what was exported is vastly disproportionate. 66m doses worldwide, 11m were donations, the rest were contractually obligated or a part of the lifting of export restrictions setup by the US which flew in the face of India's ban on exports after Covid cases began to rise. Covax is the only Indian-produced covid vaccine, and the rest which were produced were exported to the US and other countries. Out of this total last year, it breaks down like this:

66m total from January 2020 - April 2021

11m were donated out of goodwill

As of now, 216m have received their first dose of the vaccine in India, with only 43m being fully vaccinated. That is only about 16% of the population, despite being the largest manufacturer of vaccines, they were exporting most of what they produced to wealthier countries up until recently. For a comparison, this is the amount of people who have gotten a vaccine (not fully vaccinated) in some countries:

UK: 98%

US: 90%

Germany: 64%

France: 56%

China: 50%

Russia: 20%

India: 16%

If India kept ""plenty for itself"" why is it that there is such a large disparity here?

If there's a slowdown in bookings then earlier.  
  
But add in local variation in rates and choice of day to announce and it could be today/tomorrow/Monday.  

This does mean the 31st July goal of vaccinating everyone won't be hit for fully vaccinated but does look likely for 1st doses, which the government really want to hit even if it means dipping into their vaccine caches.  

The better news is that unlike AstraZeneca with Pfizer/Moderna there is no benefit to waiting more than four weeks for the second dose so if supply is good enough everyone could be fully vaccinated by the end of August which might cause a slight stumbling block to opening up for summer due to the Indian (delta) variant but it might just be enough to make a significant difference to finally ending all restrictions.

* = around 370 million doses given (depending on J&amp;J doses)

* 1.2% test positivity (7-day rolling average)  

* 11,723 COVID-19 patients in hospital  

* 4,880 COVID-19 patients in ICU

Reality:

* 50.5% (around 169 million first doses given) of the total population vaccinated with at least the first dose
* 40.7% (around 136 million full vaccinations given) of the total population fully vaccinated
* = around 300 million vaccine doses given

* 3.3% test positivity (7-day rolling average)
* 20,539 COVID-19 patients in hospital
* 5,750 COVID-19 patients in ICU

Interesting. It seems like the US certainly did worse at exiting the pandemic through vaccinations. Comparatively, it did worse than Israel at everything. But certain things, like the reproduction rate and people in ICU got quite close to Israel. Vaccinations also got quite close, but there is still quite a difference, due to high vaccine hesitancy in the US it seems. 

Hospitalisations did decent as well, at twice as bad as Israel during their exit.

But cases, test positivity all did around three times as bad as Israel did in their exit. 

Especially deaths are quite striking in my opinion. I am always surprised at how high deaths in the US stayed relative to their other numbers and vaccinations. In my country (the Netherlands) they managed to get a massive and more extreme reduction of deaths earlier while having a much higher case load (three times as high) and with less vaccines (around 1 month behind the US) compared to the US. My suspicion was always because at least for my country, the order of vaccinations was always strictly followed and always prioritised the vulnerable and elderly first with very high early vaccination turnout compared to the US. And of course there is a much higher vaccination turnout here (\~90% wants a vaccine here) than in the US. For example, well over 90% of the elderly here have been vaccinated, compared to 86% in the US. That additional 5 to 10% of the elderly vaccinated here might mean te difference between 180 deaths per day (Dutch rate adjusted to US population) compared to 540 deaths per day in the US.

""Rootclaim is willing to bet $100,000 that vitamin D (e.g. calcifediol) is effective in reducing the severity of Covid-19.  
The specifics: On September 1st, 2022, an arbitrator, agreed upon in advance, will review the evidence available by that time, and determine whether the following statement is more likely true or false: Vitamin D (administered in a form such as calcifediol) reduces the odds of ICU admission due to Covid-19 by at least 1.5.  
This is the second in a series of Rootclaim Challenges, and is intended to show that the reluctance to implement a vitamin D protocol today is irrational. A decision maker who is not pushing to adopt the proposed protocol is effectively claiming that the probability that this protocol is better than existing treatments is low.

We know that hospitalization of children due to COVID is extremely rare and we can assume that all of the hospitalized are adults.  [Over 65% of Seychelles's population was fully vaccinated as of 5/25](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations).  Since they have only been giving the vaccines to adults, this means that \~90% of adults are fully vaccinated.

So the vaccinated \~90% accounts for \~20% of the hospitalizations, while the unvaccinated \~10% accounts for \~80%  of the hospitalizations.  

(80% / 10%) / (20% / 90%) = 36

This means that the rate of hospitalization for the unvaccinated is 36 times that of the vaccinated, giving an efficacy of 1-1/36 = 97% against hospitalizations.

Also, it has been reported that all of Seychelles' COVID deaths have been among the unvaccinated so the vaccine's efficacy in preventing death is 100% ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKx3oSGcJEw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKx3oSGcJEw)  at 3:50).",,,1622823330,{},h0kz8u9,False,t3_nra69l,False,True,t1_h0g3x9g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nra69l/bahrain_facing_a_covid_surge_starts_giving_pfizer/h0kz8u9/,1622961789,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

On the other hand, you have scientific bureaucracy working through the actual rigor of discovery and analysis. Their goal being outbreak prevention and pandemic secession, they have spent the year trying desperately to convince the public of the best and most effective ways to slow and stop the pandemic.

_____
The research team systematically reviewed evidence from 215 studies of Covid-19 from 30 countries, involving a total of 105,638 people with acute symptoms of Covid-19, including data up until July 2020 (acute refers to the main disease stage, rather than longer-term impacts). The studies varied as to which symptoms they were tracking, and the research team pooled data to compare how common each symptom was among the studies that tracked it.  
  
  

Across the whole dataset, the most common neurological and psychiatric symptoms were: anosmia (loss of smell; reported by 43% of patients with Covid-19), weakness (40%), fatigue (38%), dysgeusia (loss of taste; 37%), myalgia (muscle pain; 25%), depression (23%), headache (21%) and anxiety (16%). They also identified the presence of major neurological disorders such as ischaemic stroke (1.9% of cases in the dataset), hemorrhagic stroke (0.4%) and seizure (0.06%). Patients with severe Covid-19 were overrepresented in the dataset as a whole, as most of the studies focused on hospitalized patients, and even the studies of people outside of hospital included few people with very mild or no symptoms.  
  
  
But among people with symptomatic acute Covid-19 who were not hospitalized, neurological and psychiatric symptoms were still common: 55% reported fatigue, 52% loss of smell, 47% muscle pain, 45% loss of taste, and 44% reported headaches. The researchers say it’s still possible that such symptoms are just as common in severe cases, as mild symptoms might not be reported by a patient in critical care.",,,1622828556,{},h0lbgeh,True,t3_nsavm2,False,False,t3_nsavm2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nsavm2/neurological_and_psychiatric_symptoms_such_as/h0lbgeh/,1622968664,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

We will all be getting second doses - whether it’s AZ or Sinopharm. 

The scheduling of second doses is what’s logistically challenging. Ensuring the availability within the window needed for that particular vaccine. 

The Sinopharm second dose is given 3 weeks later. So knowing for certain when another batch may arrive is the difference between vaccinating fewer people fully (2 doses) or vaccinating more people with confidence that their second dose arrives in time. 

All vaccines are administered thru our health centers. And the process is diff for AZ vs Sinopharm. 

For AZ, vitals are taken up front and you’re monitored for 30 mins afterward. That affects scheduling of appts. 

It also affects what you go out looking for. 
Let’s say you expect a dry spell in vaccine shipments, so you go out looking for more to purchase or via donation. If you suddenly get vaccines close to expiry (it happens) that you must use within a specific window of time you have to mobilize your resources differently to ensure they can be used.

As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for binding to human ACE2 with an efficient solution different from those previously predicted7,11. Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used19. However, the genetic data irrefutably show that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone20. Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer; and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage could have given rise to SARS-CoV-2.""

There were a few trials and studies looking at the impact of OTC painkillers before immunizations, mostly in children (the theory being that this would make the shots less traumatic for the kids).  Some of them found slightly reduced immunity.   One or two found increased immunity.

They have huge inequality and lack of services for some parts of the population/geography to be able to handle a massive, ongoing emergency.  


In addition, their lockdown measures were ineffective, in many areas people don't have refrigeration and could not just ""stay home"" because they would not have any food.

&gt; My housemate works in a hospital and she says the data is not an accurate reflection of the situation because they’re now admitting covid-positive people to hospital for a couple of days who just need a bit of extra oxygen and monitoring, whereas during the first/second waves those people would have been told to recover at home, so that beds could be saved for those acutely ill and needing ventilation. She says the number of patients in ICU is still decreasing every day.

&gt; But that’s just her take on it, I have no idea if that applies across the country!

While that's anecdotal, it makes sense to me: last year, when the hospitals were overwhelmed with *really* sick people, the less-ill were sent home with pulse-oximeters and instructions and were told to come back if things got worse.  In normal times, they would have been admitted for observation, but under the circumstances last year they got sent home.

Things are better at the hospitals now, so they're actually able to admit those patients they were reluctantly forced to send home last year.",,,1622830368,{},h0lfldp,False,t3_ns6d6p,False,False,t1_h0lao17,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ns6d6p/delta_variant_30100_more_transmissible_says_uk/h0lfldp/,1622970985,7,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

- At 2 May 2021, an estimated 1.0 million people living in private households in the UK (1.6%) were experiencing self-reported long COVID (symptoms persisting for more than four weeks after the first suspected coronavirus (COVID-19) infection that were not explained by something else).


- The estimates presented in this analysis relate to self-reported long COVID, as experienced by study participants who responded to a representative survey, rather than clinically diagnosed ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 or post-COVID-19 syndrome in the full population.


- Of people with self-reported long COVID, 869,000 first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 at least 12 weeks previously, and 376,000 first had (or suspected they had) COVID-19 at least one year previously.
Self-reported long COVID symptoms were adversely affecting the day-to-day activities of 650,000 people, with 192,000 of these individuals reporting that their ability to undertake their day-to-day activities had been limited a lot.


- Fatigue was the most common symptom reported as part of individuals' experience of long COVID (547,000 people), followed by shortness of breath (405,000), muscle ache (313,000), and difficulty concentrating (285,000).


- As a proportion of the UK population, prevalence of self-reported long COVID was greatest in people aged 35 to 69 years, females, those living in the most deprived areas, those working in health or social care, and those with another activity-limiting health condition or disability; prevalence was lowest in people of Asian ethnic background.


- The raised prevalence of self-reported long COVID among health and social care workers compared with those in other sectors was largely explained by other (non-employment) socio-demographic characteristics and the risk of initial infection.",,,1622831883,{},h0ljflp,True,t3_nsc448,False,False,t3_nsc448,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nsc448/prevalence_of_ongoing_symptoms_following/h0ljflp/,1622973053,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Chile on the other hand seems like it would have been better off making sure each inoculated person got 2 doses of sinopharm. There’s a lot of various factors but AZ seems be more effective longer than a month whereas sinopharm really seems to be a lot better with that 2nd dose.

Hippies, despite the philosophies they preach, mirror the behavior of every other society. 

There’s a hierarchy, just like in a capitalist society. People are always trying to work their way up it. Those at the top get the girls. Those at the bottom dont. If you have money, you’re higher.

Something there acts as a pseudo religion (like you mentioned). 

People still do anything to get rich, just like in normal society. There’s greed, jealousy, and every other human vice.

I learned a lot, and the big takeaway being that innate human traits don’t change, and aren’t going to. The same propulsion people had toward religion isn’t going away.

They do not want to create a split in society on vaccination status, especially when not everyone has had the chance to get vaccinated. And when everyone who wants it is finally vaccinated, masks are probably not even needed anymore for anyone due to the very high vaccination willingness here. 

They are also working with a strictly invitation and age based system from young to old. They are literally inviting one to two years (e.g. 1983 today, 1982 yesterday). The only exceptions to the age groups are people who are at higher risks (priority groups) for COVID-19 specifically, like people in institutions (e.g. nursing homes and prisons), people with health risks for COVID-19 and healthcare workers. So no politicians (our Prime-Minister only got vaccinated a coupe of days ago), teachers and Police Officers for example. It is all pretty strict and controlled, with having to make appointments beforehand if you are eligible the vaccine (which is all checked). 

Because they are only working from young to old, it is a bit unfair to the younger generations. Also, without a good way to verify vaccination status (without violating privacy) means a lot of unvaccinated people will try to seem vaccinated, so you'd have to work with an honor system.

Until then, the solution is to have the same measures as everyone. But if you want to travel internationally or want to go to an event without masks and distancing, you will need an app where can be seen if you are ""green"" through a QR code which is either achieved by being fully vaccinated or a free recent rapid test at one of the testing sites explicitly tasked with doing such tests. No one can see how you achieved your ""green"" status, to keep privacy of vaccination status in check.

Also, the Netherlands has been experiencing a much higher cases and hospitalisation load than the US, which is currently still the case. This is because the Netherlands always was around 1 month ahead of the US in terms of their waves, was also 1 month ahead in terms of B.1.1.7 spread and was around 1 month behind in terms of vaccinations. Which meant the Netherlands never had the chance to prevent the third wave of cases, they only managed to prevent a third wave of deaths (deaths and excess mortality never increased during this third wave).

Still totally worth checking out if you haven't already. Hasn't gone out of date yet. 

[Original Comment 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mnzwri/daily_discussion_thread_april_10_2021/gu200jr/) - Additional stuff, thoughts. Much less worth checking out, but there are a few things in there that are still good.

If you have any food that you bought last year for Covid lockdown/emergencies/etc., now is the time to eat it or donate it to a food pantry. If it's expired, eat it or toss it instead of donating it please.  If you want to be prepared for future emergencies, go ahead and buy more to replace it, I guess.

If you're an American and you've been waiting for your turn to get vaccinated, it's your turn.

If you are vaccinated, it's your turn to help other people get vaccinated. 

If you have a strategy to get older Americans vaccinated, please spread the word. 

I think we need to get to the point where we can get hospitals back to normal operation and get family doctors/GP's doses to give out like they do with the flu vaccine. And like tons of extra doses. Novavax should help here.

The vaccines are FREE in the US.  FREE FREE, not like ""Copay free"", like fuckin FREE.  Go get one. Now.  Is there something stopping you from going to get one today? Talk to me about it, we'll get it worked out.

&gt;Introducing the new recommendations on Thursday, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the C.D.C. director, cited two recent scientific findings as significant factors: Few vaccinated people become infected with the virus, and transmission seems rarer still; and the vaccines appear to be effective against all known variants of the coronavirus. 

Remember, if you got infected, recovered, and then got at least one dose of Pfizer, you have immunity not only to multiple variants, but also SARS-CoV-1, the virus for which we named SARS in 2003.

People most vulnerable to Covid-19 could require a booster of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine later this year, according to scientists who said the shot elicited a lower antibody response against the Delta variant first identified in India.

A study by researchers at the Francis Crick Institute and UCLH Biomedical Research Centre found that levels of neutralising antibodies in recipients of two shots of the vaccine were, on average, more than five times lower against the Delta variant than the original strain that emerged in Wuhan, China.

In a research letter published in the medical journal The Lancet, the scientists said that the results showed older people were the most affected and that their antibody levels declined over time. 

Emma Wall, an infectious diseases consultant at UCLH, said “the most important thing” was to ensure the vaccines keep as many people as possible out of hospital. 

“Our results suggest that the best way to do this is to quickly deliver second doses and provide boosters to those whose immunity may not be high enough against these new variants,” she added. 

After only one dose of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, 32 per cent of people showed a quantifiable antibody response against the Delta variant, the study found. In contrast about 79 per cent of people had a quantifiable antibody response against the original strain of coronavirus after their first jab.

Only about 25 per cent showed a response against the Beta variant, which first emerged in South Africa. It is not known exactly what level of antibodies is required to protect against disease. 

Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh, said the data suggested that vaccines may offer “somewhat less protection against infection with the Delta variant”.

But Riley cautioned that the antibody response was not the only factor that dictated the effectiveness of an inoculation. “These data cannot tell us whether the vaccine will be any less effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalisation and death; we need to wait for the actual data on these outcomes,” she said. 

“There are reasons to be optimistic on this score, as other immune responses — such as T cells — also contribute to protection against severe disease and these may be less affected by the mutations that affect antibody neutralisation.”

A study by Public Health England last month of the real world impact of the vaccines, found that two doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer shot was slightly less effective against the Delta variant, showing 88 per cent efficacy, compared with 93 per cent against the Alpha strain first identified in Kent. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine was also less effective, that study found, with efficacy falling from 66 per cent for the Alpha variant to 60 per cent for Delta. 

Pfizer said that it had not seen the Francis Crick and UCLH study. 

Also on Thursday, Public Health England warned that early evidence suggested that “there may be an increased risk of hospitalisation” with disease caused by the Delta variant when compared with the Alpha variant, first identified in the UK. It cautioned, however, that more data was needed to have more confidence in the finding. 

The public health agency said that Delta had overtaken the Alpha variant as the dominant Sars-Cov-2 variant in the country. It added that 278 people had attended A&amp;E this week, resulting in 94 overnight admissions. This marks a slight uptick compared with last week, when 201 attended emergency services and 43 were admitted, it said.

The agency stressed that “the majority of these [cases] had not been vaccinated”. Among those admitted to hospital overnight, 66 per cent had not been vaccinated at all, and only 5 per cent had received both doses, according to PHE documents. The health body urged continued caution, saying that it was “absolutely crucial” that people played their part in preventing the spread of contagion.",,,1622827888,{},h0l9x38,True,t3_nsaimz,False,False,t1_h0l9nlq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nsaimz/vulnerable_people_may_need_vaccine_boosters_this/h0l9x38/,1622967811,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
