However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

(1) Is there a reliable source of data on Covid vaccine injuries? The only source I've found is VAERS, which says right on the webpage that the data is not reliable.

(2) I've read a number of stories on r/vaccinelonghaulers where the doctor denied the vaccine caused the side effect. I'm getting the impression that symptoms in a person who has Covid are ascribed to Covid, but that when they follow the vaccine, the response is often ""Correlation doesn't equal causation"" and ""That might have happened to you anyway.""

If I'm right about the above, that would mean there cannot be a reliable source of data on vaccine injuries, since they would be underreported. It also means people who are injured by the vaccine would be unlikely to get compensation, since their doctors wouldn't back them up.

[],,CelestialCalamari,,,[],,,,text,t2_a7tygdsn,False,False,[],"Yeah, once everyone has been able to either get vaccinated or choose not to, it will be much harder to get people to care about slowing the spread. I mean, we're practically there already, but as you mentioned, kids being able to get vaccinated might be the last big hurdle. I'm still concerned about people who either can't get vaccinated because of medical reasons (although I think the number of people who have legitimate medical reasons for not being able to get vaccinated is very low) or are still at risk despite being vaccinated (due to being immunocompromised- although I'm pretty sure the number of people who fall into that category is also very low, given the low numbers of deaths among vaccinated people in general, and booster shots should help strengthen those people's immunity too). I'm also concerned about unvaccinated people filling up hospitals and taking resources away from other patients, but hopefully that will become less of a concern with time, maybe because of treatments becoming more sophisticated or something like that.

Kids being able to get vaccinated will definitely be a huge milestone, though, and at *some* point, we have to be able to decide ""alright, everyone's had the opportunity to get vaccinated, and we can't keep our lives derailed for the stubborn people who refused that opportunity forever"". The number of people who are at risk through no fault of their own is very small (excluding kids, but they very rarely die from COVID anyway, fortunately, and many of them will soon be vaccinated). I'm not saying we shouldn't be concerned with their well-being, but I think we will get to the point where we accept that there's a very small population of chronically at-risk people who are going to have to work hard to protect themselves and move on with our lives, just as we did whenever we considered things like the death rate of the flu in previous years. Unvaccinated people will continue to spread the virus at higher rates than vaccinated people, of course, but hopefully their effect on those tiny populations of at-risk people will diminish, and we'll be able to accept the risk to those people just as we accepted the risk to high-risk people in flu seasons past.",,,,1633751702,{},hfxwe8k,False,t3_q3q2sq,False,False,t1_hfug3tr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q3q2sq/human_behavior_will_determine_when_the_covid19/hfxwe8k/,1633879412.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,sharkinwolvesclothin,,,[],,,,text,t2_91r0t,False,False,[],"Table 2 actually has a pretty good estimate of how much of that is confounding - those 10-fold reductions are comparing people who get a booster to those who don't, and they are different groups living different lives in different locations. They don't basically have any sociodemographic data, so it's hard to know what these groups are, but the one variable they have shows the nonbooster group has over 4 times more Arabs, demonstrating they really come from different populations. And even for same demographics, those who choose to get a booster are different (we should expect them to be more likely to wear masks, take precautions). 

Luckily, the paper has an estimate of that difference. Table 2 also compares those who got the booster before and after the booster kicked in, and it shows a 5 to 11-fold reduction, with 16-29 olds being an outlier upwards. I don't know what biological mechanism would be for a booster to work best for youngsters, so I'd treat it as a statistical anomaly, it's a smaller group because they started booster later. 

The 5 to 7-fold reductions observed in the adult groups are still confounded by behavioral issues: people get a booster, they are told that the extra protection gets a week to kick in, so they are probably more careful with distancing and masks for that week, and then relax.

[],,ThatOneGrayCat,,,[],,,,text,t2_2zmfbqjc,False,False,[],"In short: getting infected with covid produces long-lasting ""memory"" in all the major organs that contribute to immune cell production. 

Note that this was only a study of organs from people who'd died after having recovered from covid, and having died of other causes, I assume, because these were all organs tested in the organ donation program. So these would have been people who'd died from accidents or non-pandemic-related diseases.

Also note that this study only looked at organ production of immune cells; it wasn't designed to look at how vaccinations provide long-term memory, so it's not commenting one way or another on how well vaccines protect long-term. It is only a statement on how the immune system responds to having been infected with covid.

The longer explanation: A lot of different organs contribute to production of the various cell types needed to have a robust immune response against particular diseases. This study took samples from donated organs from people who'd once tested positive for covid, and assessed how well those immune-contributing organs ""remembered"" the coronavirus (and could therefore effectively produce the cells to fight against it.) All of the organs responsible for immune response had excellent response, indicating that infection with covid should provide a long-lasting immune response against the disease.

(Of course, as we've seen, delta is highly infectious and seems to be able to re-infect people at higher rates than previous strains. So that doesn't mean if you've been infected once, you'll never get it again. You just might not get AS sick? Delta will still kick your ass.)

This study is notable because previously, they'd only been able to test long-term immune response via blood samples. Taking samples from donated organs allowed them to look at how the immune system responds to coronavirus in a broader, more nuanced way.

&gt;Sheriff Alex Villanueva, who oversees the largest sheriff's department in the county with roughly 18,000 employees, said Thursday in a Facebook Live event that he does not plan to carry out the county's mandate, under which Los Angeles County employees had to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 1.

&gt;The mandate was issued by executive order in August and allows only for religious and medical exemptions. Villanueva said his employees are willing to be terminated rather than get vaccinated.

&gt;‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be in a position to lose 5, 10% of my workforce overnight on a vaccine mandate,‚Äù the sheriff said.

&gt;More than 26,000 people have died of the coronavirus in Los Angeles County, which is the nation's most populous county.

&gt;Of the county‚Äôs roughly 10 million residents, 78% have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose and 69% are fully vaccinated, according to public health officials.

&gt;Health officials said the county has reported 14 deaths a day, on average, even though deaths and hospitalization figures have plunged by some 50% since late August.

Experts are split on whether the waning delta surge will be the last major COVID-19 wave to strike the U.S., as Americans grow eager for the pandemic to end after 19 months. 

The vaccination rate and decreasing cases in most states have provided a ray of hope that the pandemic could be winding down after its final large wave, some experts say. 

But other public health experts caution the unpredictability of the virus suggests another surge could still happen as the country braces for winter ‚Äî which led to skyrocketing cases, deaths and hospitalizations last year.

Nicholas Reich, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said declaring there won‚Äôt be another major wave after delta ‚Äúfeels like‚Äù a ‚Äúpremature‚Äù and ‚Äúbold‚Äù statement.

‚ÄúIs there a chance? Sure, but I feel like if there's one thing we've learned from this, it's that there's a lot more sort of uncertainty and randomness ‚Ä¶ in COVID then we've given it credit for so far,‚Äù he said.

Some experts, including Reich, pointed out that factors such as the potential development of variants and the unknown endurance of immunity after infection and vaccination could spark larger-scale rises in COVID-19 cases after the country has seen a national decline. 

The approaching winter season also makes it difficult to forecast future COVID-19 trends, as coronaviruses can more easily spread in colder weather and in indoor spaces. Last winter, the U.S. saw its highest surge of cases, hospitalizations and deaths amid holiday gatherings held before vaccines became widely available.

Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, said he expects cases to increase in the winter after bottoming out in October, but that it is likely to be lower than the delta surge.  

‚ÄúI think some people will be surprised that it doesn't just keep going away, and ‚Ä¶ that doesn't seem very likely,‚Äù he said. 

Wen of George Washington University said having just 56.2 percent of the total U.S. population fully vaccinated and fewer restrictions than last year leaves it uncertain that the delta wave could be the U.S.‚Äôs final major COVID-19 surge.

‚ÄúI don't know how we could possibly say that considering we don't know what's going to come our way,‚Äù Wen said.

‚ÄúI'm not sure how we can know for certain that the level of protection we have nailed through vaccination is sufficient,‚Äù she said, adding she‚Äôs hopeful the end is ‚Äúon the horizon‚Äù with children‚Äôs vaccines, oral treatment and more testing. 

Others, including former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner Scott Gottlieb, took a more optimistic stance, anticipating that cases won‚Äôt rise to the summer delta levels again. 

‚ÄúBarring something unexpected, I‚Äôm of the opinion that this is the last major wave of infection,‚Äù Gottlieb told The New York Times this week.

Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, told MSNBC on Friday that any rise in winter cases will likely be ‚Äúmore decoupled from hospitalizations and deaths‚Äù due to the increased immunity due to vaccines and infections.

‚ÄúMany more people have been vaccinated, so many more people have natural immunity from this big delta wave and unfortunately so many people have died that we probably won‚Äôt see peaks that are anything like we saw in the past, especially when it comes to what matters which is hospitalization, serious disease and death,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI think delta was hopefully the worst that this virus can throw at us,‚Äù he added.

David Dowdy, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said he thinks it‚Äôs ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù that the U.S. will endure another COVID-19 wave ‚Äúto the level‚Äù of the summer delta and previous winter surges. 

With the vaccination level rising and a ‚Äúfair amount‚Äù of the unvaccinated getting infected, Americans‚Äô immunity is ‚Äúhigher now than it‚Äôs ever been,‚Äù he said.

The emergence of a new variant could potentially threaten that immunity if the strain evades the vaccines. But Dowdy said he doesn‚Äôt expect that in the short-term, as delta has reigned as the dominant variant worldwide for months without another strain usurping it. 

‚ÄúI think anyone who says that they can predict the future of this pandemic is probably lying to you,‚Äù Dowdy said. ‚ÄúBut I think we have a lot of reasons to be optimistic that we will not see another massive wave the way that we have seen so far.‚Äù",,,,1633797888,{},hfzynvo,True,t3_q4oxyk,False,False,t3_q4oxyk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q4oxyk/are_covid19s_big_waves_over_experts_are_split/hfzynvo/,1633919118.0,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So yes, supply had a role to play obviously (most noteably, the absolute dumping of 7+ million doses by Moderna mid-late June with a slight slowdown of Pfizer deliveries early July expected) but my point is we could have waited and everyone could have gotten their 2nd shot that matched their first shot in the time frame we'd originally planned for.

These are not considered boosters because immunocompromised people need 3 doses to get the benefits most people get from 2. Also, most places don't really enforce the ""must be severely immunocompromised"" part, so others are also getting the shot who don't qualify. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pfizer has that plus an additional recommendation for boosters for at least 80% of the adult population. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of the complexity of the issue and the dearth of data in some areas, I think the current recommendations are pretty reasonable and necessarily complex (except perhaps the lack of official support for Janssen boosters similar to what has been given for Pfizer, but that should change soon now that Janssen has sent in data/requested an amendment to the EUA for boosters; this is largely not the FDA/CDC's fault but rather J&amp;J's). Its actually going to get more complex as Moderna should be getting a low-dose booster, while the immunocompromised may still need the full-dose 3rd shot. Once the mix-and-match studies are finished, we may also get more complex recommendations based on that. There's the issue of Moderna and young males, which could lead to them being recommended to get Pfizer for their boosters (as is already being done for 2nd shots in some countries). 

The problems are complex and people are different.

Doctors back then initially thought that children didn't get the disease at all, since adults were getting extremely sick and kids had a few mild colds.

I wonder whether coronaviruses in general should be thought of as similar to chickenpox: viruses that are generally very mild if you get them as a child, but potentially very serious if you get them as an adult with no immunity (obviously chickenpox immunity works differently, but the general idea is quite similar).

It may be the case that coronaviruses generally cause serious pandemics when they enter a new population, but once they're endemic, they're mild annoyances because children are less affected and adults all have some degree of immunity (even if they can still get it, they're protected from severe disease).",,,,1633780382,{},hfz0bpy,False,t3_q47l0i,False,False,t1_hfy6q6u,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q47l0i/delta_does_not_appear_to_make_children_sicker/hfz0bpy/,1633901211.0,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; has been supplying its shots almost exclusively to wealthy nations, keeping poorer countries waiting and earning billions in profit.

Oh so they've been supplying first to countries that ordered first? The horror!

&gt; Moderna has shipped a greater share of its doses to wealthy countries than any other vaccine manufacturer

Richer countries prefer to order from Moderna and it's Moderna's fault they don't have enough capacity to fulfill all possible orders?

&gt; and at least three have had to pay more than the United States or European Union did

The US, which threw more than a billion dollars to help fund the vaccine, gets a discount? How dare they!

&gt; All of the doses they produce this year are filling existing orders from governments like the European Union.

How could Moderna not work to fulfill existing orders and instead ignore their existing customers?

&gt; Moderna tried and failed last year to get governments to kick in money to expand the company‚Äôs scant production capacity

Stupid Moderna, couldn't even convince countries to invest in expanding capacity despite promising trials and the like. Clearly we blame this all on Moderna and not those countries that decided not to invest.

&gt; In May, Moderna offered the African Union doses for about $10 each, according to a bloc official involved in the discussions. But the doses wouldn‚Äôt be available until next year, causing the talks to fall apart, according to two African Union officials.

So Moderna offers doses cheaply, but can't deliver this year due to prior committments. Clearly it's their fault that countries decided to not to try to get what they could, even if delayed, at such a cheap price. I guess the AU can wait around until they can get same day delivery, instead of ordering now and getting vaccines later, as the US and other countries did, much to their benefit.

My school was so shit for bullying. They claimed zero tolerance and made a big show of it but once real bullying happened they did nothing. Forced the bully to say sorry and then maybe called their parents and that was it. And with every new year it was a clean slate from their perspective. I had to bring this one guy down to the office like three times a year because he just didn‚Äôt get the damn point and every time I tried to talk about previous years they were like ‚ÄúPssh. Last year? That doesn‚Äôt matter anymore‚Äù. 

High school was a breath of fresh air. Asshole got suspended the first time and stopped. All it would have taken for my elementary school to end the dude‚Äôs reign of terror would be to give him a one week suspension but they let him go time after time after time again. In general the school was shit. Some of the teachers were fine but the administration was full of the most corrupt and egotistical people I‚Äôve seen. The principle had no children of her own and had about 0 idea how to actually work with children. She ran the school like a business and wasted tens of thousands of dollars on useless crap like renovating rooms that no one was actually allowed in to and buying all sorts of high tech toys that no one was allowed to use.

Our school is being really excessive with its rec center restrictions and its getting frustrating. Myself and plenty of my classmates have a pick up basketball group. Our first year, before the shutdown, we used to play all the time with no worries about anything (everyone was on largely the same schedule and we could walk in anytime). Now flash forward to our 3rd year, and now just finding one time that works for everyone is such a pain. Finding a time that fits everyones schedules is hard enough on its own (a lot of students are only on campus for 2-3 days a week now), but everyone that wants to go has to reserve a spot at the gym. And not only do you have to reserve a time, but you are limited to pre-determined 1.5 hour blocks outside of which you cannot be there (i.e. there is a 5:30-7:00 block, even if you get there at 6:15 you can only stay till 7 and they dont allow back-to-back sessions). Even worse is that its largely based on the undergrad schedule of classes (myself+my group are at the law school here). For example, the undergrads have a class-block ending at 5:20 and thus they can get out, make it to the 5:30 block, and have plenty of time to play, no issue. But myself and most of my classmates have classes ending at 5:50, so if we want to make it to the 5:30 block, in the time it takes to get out of class, walk down to the gym, get changed, stretch out, and get warmed up we have like 40 minutes to actually play. We could do the later blocks but a lot of people have long commutes. 

Like I can understand in a normal gym where there might not be a way to enforce who is vaccinated and who is not, but this is a school gym where all students are required to be vaccinated. We really need to do this now? I understand the pandemic is not over and I'm generally still being cautious but this is excessive imo.

Sheriffs aren't beyond consequences and they don't just get to ignore laws they don't like. 

Being sheriff in that case was besides the point. The court ordered him personally to do something. He refused. The same would happen to you or I without being a sheriff. When the court orders an individual to do something, regardless of your job, you do it or are in contempt.

That is not the case here. The health department does not have the powers of a court. Even if it did, the mandate wasn't an order to the LA Sheriff personally.

Ron DeSantis‚Äôs administration that make masks optional.

&gt;The eight districts, whose boards all voted to require masks in school buildings, could face cutbacks equal to their school board members‚Äô salaries unless, according to the Tampa Bay Times, they show within 48 hours that they are in compliance with state orders. The districts are in Alachua, Brevard, Broward, Duval, Leon, Miami-Dade, Orange and Palm Beach Counties.

&gt;The measure was approved unanimously during a conference call meeting on Thursday by the State Board of Education, all of whose members are appointees by Republican governors. The vote came after superintendents from the eight districts argued their mask policies had been effective at curbing the spread of the virus.

&gt;After the vote, one of the superintendents, Alberto M. Carvalho of Miami-Dade County Public Schools, noted on Twitter there had been ‚Äúno major outbreaks‚Äù in his district and that student cases had been declining after a spike in early September.

&gt;‚ÄùWe disagree with today‚Äôs State Board of Education‚Äôs recommendation and wholeheartedly believe that we are in compliance with law, reason, and science,‚Äù he said in a Twitter post.

&gt;But the state board said that the county school boards had ‚Äúwillingly and knowingly violated the rights of students and parents by denying them the option to make personal and private health care and educational decisions for their children.‚Äù

Background  
The impact of COVID-19 on physical and mental health and employment after hospitalisation with acute disease is not well understood. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of COVID-19-related hospitalisation on health and employment, to identify factors associated with recovery, and to describe recovery phenotypes.  
Methods  
The Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study (PHOSP-COVID) is a multicentre, long-term follow-up study of adults (aged ‚â•18 years) discharged from hospital in the UK with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, involving an assessment between 2 and 7 months after discharge, including detailed recording of symptoms, and physiological and biochemical testing. Multivariable logistic regression was done for the primary outcome of patient-perceived recovery, with age, sex, ethnicity, body-mass index, comorbidities, and severity of acute illness as covariates. A post-hoc cluster analysis of outcomes for breathlessness, fatigue, mental health, cognitive impairment, and physical performance was done using the clustering large applications k-medoids approach. The study is registered on the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN10980107).  
Findings  
We report findings for 1077 patients discharged from hospital between March 5 and Nov 30, 2020, who underwent assessment at a median of 5¬∑9 months (IQR 4¬∑9‚Äì6¬∑5) after discharge. Participants had a mean age of 58 years (SD 13); 384 (36%) were female, 710 (69%) were of white ethnicity, 288 (27%) had received mechanical ventilation, and 540 (50%) had at least two comorbidities. At follow-up, only 239 (29%) of 830 participants felt fully recovered, 158 (20%) of 806 had a new disability (assessed by the Washington Group Short Set on Functioning), and 124 (19%) of 641 experienced a health-related change in occupation. Factors associated with not recovering were female sex, middle age (40‚Äì59 years), two or more comorbidities, and more severe acute illness. The magnitude of the persistent health burden was substantial but only weakly associated with the severity of acute illness. Four clusters were identified with different severities of mental and physical health impairment (n=767): very severe (131 patients, 17%), severe (159, 21%), moderate along with cognitive impairment (127, 17%), and mild (350, 46%). Of the outcomes used in the cluster analysis, all were closely related except for cognitive impairment. Three (3%) of 113 patients in the very severe cluster, nine (7%) of 129 in the severe cluster, 36 (36%) of 99 in the moderate cluster, and 114 (43%) of 267 in the mild cluster reported feeling fully recovered. Persistently elevated serum C-reactive protein was positively associated with cluster severity.  
Interpretation  
We identified factors related to not recovering after hospital admission with COVID-19 at 6 months after discharge (eg, female sex, middle age, two or more comorbidities, and more acute severe illness), and four different recovery phenotypes. The severity of physical and mental health impairments were closely related, whereas cognitive health impairments were independent. In clinical care, a proactive approach is needed across the acute severity spectrum, with interdisciplinary working, wide access to COVID-19 holistic clinical services, and the potential to stratify care.",,,,1633786313,{},hfza8me,True,t3_q4lell,False,False,t3_q4lell,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q4lell/physical_cognitive_and_mental_health_impacts_of/hfza8me/,1633906479.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What I mean by that is that the vast majority of people (and NY just hit 85% of all adults with at least one dose of the vaccine, and the rates are higher in the city so we are looking pretty good) have just quietly gone back to pretty much normal lives. I still put on a mask if a business has a sign saying they require it, but I don't go out of my way to wear one if it isn't a strict requirement. Mask usage has dropped way down in places where they used to be ubiquitous, enforcement just isn't happening in a meaningful way. I occasionally see masks on people who are really old, or on young kids, and sometimes a parent with a young kid will be wearing one in what I assume is an exercise in solidarity. Social distancing is non-existent. I think the people at the extreme ends of the Covid spectrum tend to get the most attention because they are the loudest about their perspectives... so, like, people who never wanted any restrictions at all/anti-vaccine/anti-mask etc., and at the other end people who are still washing their groceries and wearing four masks... and so they tend to get the most attention, but the vast majority of folks are somewhere in the middle, where normal life has just basically resumed with maybe a bit more handwashing and still the occasional mask but that's it. I think the way the pandemic ends isn't going to be all dramatic and a big fireworks display over Brooklyn Bridge with jets flying over. It's just going to quietly peter out and things will be fully normal again as people move past it psychologically, the last restrictions get dropped once places realize no one is complying anyway, and it all gradually becomes background noise or something that we only hear about occasionally on the evening news because there is an outbreak in some low-vaccine town in some corner of the USA.",,,,1633786082,{},hfz9tbd,False,t3_q4j2gb,False,True,t1_hfywy7r,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q4j2gb/cdc_director_says_the_covid_pandemics_end_date/hfz9tbd/,,1,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,27cfce4ca08c51896d58cc9c46d0d7611a6c5d9d,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1633786097.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

There are around 1,2 million people in the age bracket: 0-19 years old.

They gave it to me early hoping that I would get some protection (I was also sent away to live with my grandparents for several weeks to keep me from being exposed at home).

The result was when I was in Jr High they checked all the vaccination records of the students. They saw that I got my shot to young and thus wanted me to get another measles shot.. I was not allowed back at school until I was up to date vaccination wise. A week after getting the shot my mother found my vaccination records they gave you in those days which showed they had in fact given me a second measles shot at the appropriate time. Thus I have been vaccinated against the measles three times. Mind you I enjoyed the three days off from school.

This is why I find it almost humorous this idea that's it's so terrible to require students to have vaccinations. We were required to have them as kids to attend school.

- You might be able to drastically shorten the infection of someone who just tested positive, probably drastically reduce their viral load and infectiousness.
- If you give the drug as a prophylactic to the contacts of the person who tested positive, you might be able to prevent an infection from being established in the first place. 
- If you employ mass rapid testing (at no charge to the person tested), you could identify lots of asymptomatic but infectious people, and offer them the drug.

You can't hire doctors, nurses, and support staff who simply don't exist.

Since you're 17 you're better of with Pfizer according to this WHO post.

Sinopharms BIBP is approved by the WHO. Does international travel play a role for you? I can see western countriesstruggle to accept chinese vaccines, but just today USA announced they would accept any vaccines approved by the WHO and FDA, this includes Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Sinopharm and Sinovac, a spokesperson from CDC said today.

Its very hard to compare different vaccines, as they tested at different times, different virus circulations, age groups, looked at different data points.

Keep in mind Sinopharm developed two very different vaccines: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html Pretty sure you'll be offered BIBP though.

This stands out because we‚Äôve been led to believe that PCR tests are the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù and LFTs are crude mass-testing devices ‚Äì that PCRs should pick up cases LFTs miss, not the other way around.

A ¬†number of explanations have been put forward. Some have suggested a faulty batch of LFTs could be causing people to test positive when they don‚Äôt have COVID. Others have hypothesised a new variant could be circulating that¬†isn‚Äôt detected¬†by the standard PCR test. There have also been¬†well-publicised¬†stories of children faking a positive LFT result using the acidic properties of soft drinks. These spoofers would subsequently test negative on a follow-up PCR test.

The increase in these events also coincides roughly with the return of schools and big rises in the number of cases in children. These positive-then-negative sequences of tests might be something to do with the way children are being tested.

I was a registrar for 7 years, a reg QA Trainer the last two years. There were only three of us QA's, with staff around (90-100) not a huge hospital but big for our area and they have four campuses in this area that our department is spread across.

We didn't get any extra pay for my department, even our ED reg staff that were right there with the techs, nursing, and drs slammed packed with covid patients didn't get shit. Due to where we live base pay is only 12 for registration. Watching the techs getting 15+ on top of regular pay and nursing 70+ on top of regular pay. Even more if nursing got called in on day off, I think last I heard was 100+ (which I'm not salty because they fucking deserve it but doesn't help morale for our dept)

Let's just say they are minus 3 QA trainers now. And quite a few of the other clerks. It's a shit job. Pretty sure I've developed some PTSD from the stress we had to endure.

I still don't have another job but I don't regret it. It's been wonderful for my mentality.

One time a teacher kicked a desk toward me and it slid into my desk from across the room. He was mad that I was talking while he was talking. I immediately picked the desk up without hesitation and through it at his face. The teacher didn't get in any trouble that I knew of. We both agreed to not press charges and I ended up getting suspended. For some context I was scrappy. I was the one always fighting for my friends in the lesser grades as they were bullied by the kids in the higher grades. I was 6ft 2in at the time and about 190 pounds. I was known for fighting ,lifting and wrestling. The second instance came after school when we were weight lifting. I was wearing a hat. A teacher followed me down the hallways all the way into the bathroom and then used the urinal right next to me and as he did he bumped into me in an aggressive way. He then waits and follows me to the sink where we wash our hands. He says take off your hat. I said schools out man go home . He says do you know who I am? This teacher had a rumor about him which stated he punched a student. I knew he was obviously trying to scare me and everything kind of came together. I got madder than I should have because that's what I did back then and I got in his face and said take my hat from my head I dare you . We starred for a moment he looked away and I walked out. There are alot of really cool teachers out there. And there are some who lose patience especially when we don't make it easy for them. In the above instance of the teacher cornering and breathing on a kid I would say not only are they putting their life at risk, potentially. They are also humiliating a kid Infront of their peers. If I was that kid I would've tried my very best to beat the crap out of that teacher. Not for putting my life at risk but for backing me down Infront of my peers and friends. The world needs more empathy right now. War , politics and COVID have everyone on the edge. Everyone's ready to fight. Let's just all calm down and try to be positive even when we know stuff is negative. Sadly we are going to see many many more break mentally before this is over. We have to do better to stop that.

&gt;The kickoff of the long-awaited children‚Äôs vaccination campaign is expected as soon as early November. And this time around, the government has purchased enough doses to give two shots to all 28 million eligible children ages 5 to 11.

&gt;Still, federal and state officials and health providers say that vaccinating children is likely to be a more challenging process than it was for adults and teens. The federal government plans to allocate the initial shots according to a formula to ensure equitable distribution, likely based on a state‚Äôs population of eligible children, according to a federal health official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share planning. Enlisting besieged health providers and persuading reluctant parents will complicate the process.

&gt;‚Ä¶

&gt;We‚Äôre ready, we have the supply,‚Äù said Jeff Zients, the White House coronavirus coordinator, appearing on CNN on Thursday. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working with states to set up convenient locations for parents and kids to get vaccinated, including pediatricians‚Äô offices and community sites.‚Äù

&gt;But the government will initially distribute only a portion of the 65 million doses it has purchased, according to a senior federal health official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share planning discussions. Up to 20 million doses will be available the first week, the official said. Federal officials are ‚Äúalso making sure that we‚Äôre not having folks unnecessarily stockpile product,‚Äù the official said.

But adolescent brains have a unique way of looking at risk and consequence. The risk and consequence are minimized and the rewards are exaggerated in the developing brain. So, when you have a kid who gets caught spray painting the school for example, it's not that he didn't think about getting caught. In his brain, the reward of doing the crime was huge, but the chance of getting punished appeared small. In a fully formed brain, the same risk and reward will appear differently balanced. An adult might look at same consequences and see that they are much bigger than the reward of doing the crime.

In earlier times of human development, this was necessary to get young people to learn new, dangerous skills like hunting, or to explore new territories, or to fight for a mate. A fully formed adult might say, ""Nope, I'm not getting eaten by a mountain lion or breaking a leg. I'm going to stay right here where I'm safe."" Our species wouldn't have made much progress. The adolescent brain looked at the same risk of being eaten or being injured and said, ""That unexplored territory looks awesome, and I'm going out there.""

So, if we apply this to the anti mask/vaccine behavior, one could definitely see how the brains of those people are minimizing the risk and consequences of covid and overstating the ""reward"" of going maskless or not getting a vaccine. But strangely, I'm seeing anti mask/vaccine behavior mostly with adults. The adolescents I know seem to have an accurate grasp on the magnitude of the consequences of covid and the minimal reward of removing a mask or not getting a shot. For them, it's momentary. They may remove their mask for a moment, but then realize the risk and put it back on.

Although there is a similarity, I would think that the brains of anti maskers are fully developed. I find it difficult to believe personally, but I'd have to blame this irrational behavior on the power of misinformation.",,,,1633792067,{},hfzlusm,False,t3_q4jbfx,False,True,t1_hfzjlv2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q4jbfx/middle_school_teacher_filmed_removing_her_face/hfzlusm/,1633912500.0,24,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,
