It's the 3rd most populous country in the world and the top two have very little immigration, so of course it would top any list going by numbers.  

I think percentage does matter more, so we are never going to reach any agreement on this. I fundamentally disagree with all the rest of your assertions.  

All of your issues come down to population size and would be true regardless of the makeup of the population.  NZ is much easier to govern because it is small.  Larger democracies in general have far more issues.  

But the assertion was that NZ is more homogenous and that's not the case at all.

My original comment was an honest question, trying to understand people’s basis for isolating the unvaccinated as a distinct danger to the vaccinated.

Vaccinated populations significantly slow the spread of the virus and are at their best a dead end for transmission. The vaccinated have a low risk of infection and present a low risk of transmission.

We have multiple risk factors.

1. Moderate risk of an unvaccinated player being infected.
2. Low risk of an infected unvaccinated player transmitting asymptotically.
3. Low risk of a vaccinated player encountering someone who is infectious when a large majority of interaction is among the vaccinated.
4. Low risk of a vaccinated player being infected.
5. Very low risk of transmission from a vaccinated player unless symptomatic, which is detectable.

When you have multiple layers of risk, a small adjustment to a single risk factor often has little effect on overall risk.

Based on this premise, I feel like increasing the percentage of vaccinated players from 85% to 100% would have little to no statical significance on the overall risk outcome.",,,,1632804919,{},hek6o8u,False,t3_pwnzza,False,True,t1_hej230v,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pwnzza/nba_legend_kareem_abduljabbar_calls_for/hek6o8u/,1632946052.0,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_4e7f2,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stern played almost no role in earlier trades and largely gave Jac Sperling and Dell Demps autonomy over team management, before pulling this retrospective “Dell Demps doesn’t have the authority to make trades” stuff. Stern’s role as “owner rep” was clearly a conflict of interest and very poorly designed. He said a few years later that Dell Demps was a horrible GM, yet did nothing.  He literally popped in to veto the trade after other owners (e.g. Dan Gilbert) whined about the Lakers forming another super team and how the Lakers would be under the luxury cap and they’d lose out on revenue sharing.

Regarding unions, ask the pilots’ unions, teamsters, police unions, etc… how their “concerns” over mandates are doing. United Airlines did not ask for union position, they issued their mandate in advance and told them it’s happening. All three unions conceded that employers have the right to mandate vaccines, and they’d lose in court if they challenged.

Unions can’t stop mandates, it’s become very clear that employers can move unilaterally in the interest of public health. Not a single union has been successful in stopping a mandate in court.

I trust her because she verifies everything she hears, being a lawyer. I want to verify if this is true on my own and start from that. And would like to get a starting point.

&gt;Concluding remarks  
&gt;  
&gt;We hypothesize that updated vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 variants might primarily boost ‘imprinted’ immune responses to conserved regions of the Spike protein to the detriment of new neutralizing responses to antigenically altered sites within new variants. We argue that this ‘updated strain’ vaccine strategy can still yield partial efficacy against the new variants, particularly for vaccines that induce potent neutralizing responses. However, robust long-term control of COVID-19 may require the development of strategies that avoid primarily boosting imprinted immune responses and instead focus neutralizing antibody immunity on the novel RBD epitopes evolving in emerging VOC.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, they are saying that vaccines designed against variants of concern, might only boost sub-optimal immune responses instead of neutralizing antibodies against the particular variant. 

They suggest to use vaccines that elicit antibodies against parts of the Spike, particularly the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the particular variant.",,,,1632839432,{},helkz0p,False,t3_px72ns,False,False,t3_px72ns,/r/Coronavirus/comments/px72ns/immune_imprinting_and_vaccine_design/helkz0p/,1632975167.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_3rjm0i6c,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction  
To eliminate the COVID-19 pandemic, the transmission of the virus SARS-CoV-2 among the population needs to be blocked and/or at least reduced. Upper respiratory tract viral loads are highest in the early stages of the disease, and high loads are associated with higher mortality rates. This study aims to evaluate the virucidal efficacy of AOS2020, a novel sprayable Acid-Oxidizing solution containing pure and stable hypochlorous acid (HClO), on human coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 in vitro, and the tolerability profile on nasal and oral mucosa suggesting to be a potential solution for upper respiratory hygiene.  
  
Method  
Virucidal assays and intranasal and oral irritation tests were undertaken in accordance with relevant national and international guidance and methods.  
  
Results  
In pre-clinical tests, the AOS2020, showed &gt; 99.8% virucidal efficacy in &lt; 1 min against SARS-Cov-2. The safety profile testing on both the nasal and oral mucosa indicates that AOS2020 is non-irritant.  
  
Conclusion  
These initial results indicate that this product has the potential treatment to reduce viral load in the upper respiratory tract.",,,,1632839152,{},helkbmv,True,t3_px7j9h,False,True,t3_px7j9h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/px7j9h/a_sprayable_acidoxidizing_solution_containing/helkbmv/,1632974815.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;Some hospital networks including Northwell Health have already fired more than two dozen health care workers. Others will have 30 days to get a COVID vaccine or lose their jobs.

&gt;Officials say 16% of the state's hospital workers are not fully vaccinated, which means more than 83,000 are at risk of termination.

&gt;Steven Corwin, the president and CEO at New York-Presbyterian Hospitals, one of the largest systems in the country, said he believes a mandate is needed to get everyone fully vaccinated.

&gt;Before its own vaccination deadline last week, 30% of staff were unvaccinated. But after the deadline, less than 1% refused the shot and resigned.

&gt;""So out of 48,000 employees and affiliated physicians, we have less than 220 that have not chosen to get the vaccine,"" Corwin told CBS News' Errol Barnett.

&gt;At Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo, about 5% of the staff, roughly 400 people, are unvaccinated and on leave.

&gt;""We stopped elective inpatient surgeries. We stopped some of our outpatient patient visits. We stopped ICU medical transfers from other referral rural hospitals...We've asked for more time to work on strategies with the state to ensure that as many people as possible get vaccinated,"" said Tom Quatroche,  the president  and CEO of Erie County Medical Center.

&gt;At a press conference Monday, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced plans to send national guard troops to short-staffed hospitals like ECMC.

&gt;But some health care workers are suing the state over the mandate, including nurse Deborah Conrad.

&gt;""I'm wearing the same exact PPE I've worn the whole pandemic and it's always kept myself and patients safe. Why has that changed?"" she said.

&gt;The Western New York nurse said she still feels uncomfortable taking the shot despite medical data that has been released that the vaccines offer strong protection against severe illness.

&gt;""Are you prepared to lose your job?"" Barnett asked.

&gt;""A career that I've loved for almost 20 years, I am prepared,"" Conrad replied.

[],,chillaban,,,,,,[],"Yeah I know how ridiculous that comment was, but it seemed like maybe it stemmed from a gross misunderstanding of hypochlorous acid and or UVC light?

Hypochlorous acid is available over the counter as an anti microbial. For humans it’s mostly as an eyelid wipe for those who get blepharitis. For animals it’s supposed to be a good antimicrobial spray, like a replacement for wound cleansers because you can’t rely on an animal to not lick the wound. But the OCl- ion is basically one of the components that makes household bleach work as a disinfectant. In fact most of these sprays just smell like bleach or a swimming pool. I wouldn’t get super excited about it though, when I use these kinds of eyelid sprays for more than twice a day it dries and peels my eyelids like crazy. It’s better than attempting to mix your own bleach but at the end of the day it’s pretty closely related to household bleach. 


Similarly UVC is meant to be harmless to your skin and eyes but good luck trying to find an actual pure UVC lamp. Most of them emit the more harmful UV spectrum as well, and some even emit ozone.

On top of that, the study looks at symptoms persistence at 3+ months, not 18+ months, so there are clearly no sample issues.

The only major symptom the ONS study did not include was brain fog. But, first of all there is a lot of overlap, secondly, brain fog is common but not super common, so the number would surely not be a lot greater than the original one. Also, I think they included symptoms like anxiety. Literally anyone can develop anxiety after a COVID infection, without having the long covid issues.

 Firstly, third booster shot was not part of an FDA approval for the vaccine, nor was it a part of clinical studies. In fact, there were FDA resignations over how this was handled.

 Secondly, I find the science behind booster shots not terribly different from the much maligned ivermectine: yes, they seem to work based on some studies, and, yes, they are generally safe, but same could be said at some point about ivermectine. There's no good reason why extra vaccines should work much better after X months.

 Thirdly, even if we buy some time with booster shots, I'm generally alarmed by what seems (perhaps incorrectly) as the lack of focus at further vaccine development. In my mind, if we know that existing COVID vaccines flawed, we should throw money at different vaccines, not more of the same.

&gt;A three-judge panel lifted a temporary ban on the mandate that was originally set to take effect Monday.

&gt;“Federal appeals exhausted. Done. The mandate moves forward,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said.

&gt;The United Federation of Teachers said 3% of teachers (about 3,400) remain unvaccinated.

&gt;School workers now have until 5 p.m. Friday to get their first dose, or risk losing their jobs, de Blasio said.

&gt;“If you have not gotten that first dose by Friday 5:00, we will assume you are not coming to work on Monday, and you will not be paid starting Monday, and we will fill your role with a substitute or an alternative employee,” de Blasio said.

&gt;Not everyone thinks the court’s decision is a done deal. Lawyers representing teachers who sued to blocked the mandate said they will petition the U.S. Supreme Court.

&gt;Staten Island special education teacher Rachel Maniscalco is one of the teachers suing the Department of Education in federal court. She blasted the mayor.

&gt;“It’s almost as though the dictator is just feeling slighted and trying to do everything in his power to ruin the people who just don’t agree with him,” Maniscalco told CBS2’s Dick Brennan.

&gt;Earlier Monday, the mayor said he was confident a judge would rule in the city’s favor by the end of the week.

&gt;Some school staff held a protest in Foley Square, arguing the city should keep its current protocol for unvaccinated staff, which is to get tested weekly.

&gt;Bronx school safety officer Taisha Richards said she will not get the vaccine and is willing to lose her job, but she doesn’t want to.

&gt;“I don’t feel like your job should be at stake,” Richards told CBS2’s Lisa Rozner. “For my religious reasons, my civil rights and freedom – freedom of choice.”

&gt;The teachers union has been encouraging staff to get vaccinated.

&gt;“We’ve already had 500 schools report to us today and only, you know, only one third of the 500 said they’re ready,” Mulgrew said.

&gt;“We are not hearing instances of school with staffing we can’t address. Do they want to give up giving to kids? Paycheck? I think they’ll realize, get vaxxed, it is the right thing to do, and will get shot,” de Blasio said.

&gt;Maniscalco disputes that.

&gt;“Hundreds at other schools. Hundreds at District 75 schools. They do not have the manpower. They do not have the subs. They are full of crap and they know we know,” Maniscalco said.

&gt;“It’s probably below two. It’s probably right below 3%. Uh, so that would be approximately 3,400, which, you know, sounds like a lot, but where we know we’re the largest school system in the country. So we have, we have a lot of teachers,” one person said.

&gt;“She like so many of other clients and other teachers have sincere concerns about the efficacy and the long term effects of the vaccine,” said attorney Mark Fonte. “They have a right to pursue their chosen profession and the government can’t arbitrarily interfere with that right.”

&gt;De Blasio said 7,000 staffers got the vaccine over the weekend.",,,,1632855855,{},hemoobl,True,t3_pxda85,False,False,t3_pxda85,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pxda85/covid_vaccine_mandate_for_nyc_teachers_to_take/hemoobl/,1632994670.0,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_58900d68,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So by this omission we can try to put ourselves in the shoes of others and see from their perspective. Let's say that for whatever reason (facebook, fox news, your cousin, ...) you have been scared by the vaccines. *Scared*. For the vast, vast majority of these regular people they are not purposefully being ignorant or trying to do anything wrong, they are just scared.

If you begin losing trust in mainstream news/medical sources you may find yourself taking ivermectin. Ivermectin is a real legitimate drug.

Reddit is correct that ivermectin almost certainly doesn't help with covid, but reddit is wrong to laugh and smugly refer to it as horse de-wormer. This is truly not much different than telling someone they're taking fish de-algae pills for their ear infection.

And the author interviewed in the article makes tons of assertions way beyond the scope of the actual study, which calls his objectivity and credibility into serious question.

First, ""how common"" something is ""for some"" is a fairly meaningless statement.  Anything is ""common"" if you narrow your sample enough.  This study only looked an extremely narrow slice of COVID patients: those admitted to the ICU in a single facility during a narrow period of time at the beginning of the pandemic, when treatment was very different from how it is now.  Even among that group, more than half did not respond to the researchers' post-discharge inquiries, making it unclear whether those who did are a representative sample even of that narrow slice of patients.

Second, ""long-term"" is fairly misleading here, as the study only looked at symptoms about 1-2 months after discharge, and provides no evidence (one way or the other) about what happened to the patients who responded after that.  One or two months may fit the definition of ""long-term"" to some, but no reasonable person would expect patients to be back to normal just one or two months after being in an ICU for 15 days (the median stay), in many cases on mechanical ventilation.  

Finally, the scary headline here about ""long-term cognitive impairment"" is based on a grand total of five (5) patients.  Three showed signs of ""questionable"" cognitive impairment and two showed signs of impairment consistent with dementia.  Taking that small data point and turning it into a headline about how cognitive impairment is ""common"" is misleading at best, misinformation at worst.",,,,1632781889,{'gid_1': 1},heiwdfp,False,t3_pwqfmw,False,False,t3_pwqfmw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pwqfmw/new_study_shows_just_how_common_longterm/heiwdfp/,1632919029.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],[],text,t2_6n79f3n6,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;a citizen:

&gt;\[M\]ay be compelled, by force if need be, against his will and without regard to his personal wishes or his pecuniary interests, or even his religious or political convictions, to take his place in the ranks of the army of his country and risk the chance of being shot down in its defense. It is not, therefore, true that the power of the public to guard itself against imminent danger depends in every case involving the control of one's body upon his willingness to submit to reasonable regulations established by the constituted authorities, under the sanction of the State, for the purpose of protecting the public collectively against such danger.”

*Zucht v. King*

&gt;“settled that it is within the police power of a state to provide for compulsory vaccination” and the case and others “also settled that a state may, consistently with the federal Constitution, delegate to a municipality authority to determine under what conditions health regulations shall become operative.

”More recently, in 2002, a federal district court declined to find a exemption to mandatory vaccinations laws for “sincerely held religious beliefs” or a fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning medical procedures of their children.""

And before you get to the 'federal government' argument

The Executive Branch could cite Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (or PHSA), which allows the Department of Health and Human Services or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to make necessary measures “to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession.”

One of those was just that immunity among the immunized appears to waning, and said nothing about the efficacy of the booster - so therefore, not particularly relevant.

The other 2 lines of evidence are what I listed.

People including a bunch of other studies in the discussion that just provide background information is not the same as saying ""numerous studies"" support the main argument in favor of the booster.

I tried linking to a video of mine, from my 10 year old medical YouTube channel (Strong Medicine), discussing the limitations of the booster data, but it got autoremoved for containing an unreliable link. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Feel free to search for it on YouTube.

Considering that the ACIP also voted 9-6 against recommending a booster to those in high-risk occupations but otherwise without risk factors, and vaccine expert Paul Offit certainly seems unexcited about the CDC's decision. There are plenty of other experts who have expressed concern about the CDC director's decision. I'm hardly out in left field here.

I hope you realize this exact rationale has been used to deny healthcare to gay people who got AIDS for decades. 

We are going to go into a REALLY deep rabbit hole if we decide that the priority of healthcare a person receives depends on their moral character and their willingness to accept risk. Do skateboarders get lower priority? Do terrorists get lower priority? (and that's without getting into what is a terrorist and what is a revolutionary) Would gay men get lower priority? Would soldiers get lower priority? Would poor, fat, or drug-addicted people get lower priority?

Medicine is very clear that a doctor should NOT, for any reason, refuse an appropriate level of care to a patient depending on what they believe is good or evil. There's plenty of prejudiced as fuck doctors out there, and keeping this hard line in the sand makes them understand that letting their personal beliefs affect their level of care will lead to them losing their medical license.

You can find other sources that will refer to what I did in making this legal argument.  Not every law has to be litigated numerous times in order to test the limits.  If the federal government can mandate vaccines for some citizens like say the military, it's not a stretch for them to be able to mandate vaccines for all. 

The language from the public health and service act was very specific about the power of the executive branch to prevent the spread of disease inside the country and between the states.  It was written for situations like this.  And the commerce clause is given an extremely wide berth in terms of what it allows the federal government to regulate. 

Just because a federal mandate covers a lot of people doesn't really make it broad in terms of the law.. Broad would be a federal mandate that required a vaccine and some other stipulation not related to the pandemic.  A covid vaccine mandate is very specific.  We have the pandemic, we have a vaccine, it's been well proven to be effective and without it we have places where hospitals are in perpetual chaos.  It creates instability in our schools, our economy and the basic functions of the government.  It's draining resources. 

I see your point and I'm not saying that its not possible for this Supreme Court to upend precedent.  A couple of them certainly have the stain of politicization on them.

It is crossing a crucial ethical boundary because some people are being stupid. Deprioritizing care based on apparent morality is only ever a good idea if you have not a single drop of foresight on how such a system might be abused. Less ambiguous rules have been used to oppress minorities for centuries.

There's plenty of people who can't get vaccinated for health, ethical or spiritual reasons, and every day there's a bigger pressure on eliminating their exemptions, no matter how valid. You might say that won't happen because XYZ but those saying have been proven wrong again and again the whole pandemic.

Tell me, what will you do about kids? Vaccines are opening up to younger and younger children. Should children be exempted from being deprioritized from healthcare, as they don't exactly control whether they get vaccinated or not? Does that mean an unvaccinated person's life becomes near worthless the moment they cross the arbitrary boundary you decide to use on who is a child and who is an adult?

Let's put it another way. Drug addiction is undoubtedly an activity that brings severe damage to people around you, and kills both the addicts as well as innocent, irrelevant people all the time. There has always been an internal push to deprioritized their care, as many are repeat patients that end up in the hospital all the time and clog up hospitals. This, in practice, however, has always led to disproportionate medical malpractice and abandonment done to certain races and ethnicities. They become a ""legal"" outlet for prejudiced doctors and administrators to play judge and decide whether their hated minorities should live or die. Right now it's only acceptable to deprioritize them from organ transplants (as they are very likely to relapse and to not follow their antirejection regimen) and even that topic is full of decades of ethical arguments within the medical community. 

Whatever good that such a decision might make will quickly be outweighed by the oppression on the innocents that it will allow and encourage. **Tell me, how do you reconcile thinking that some people are too stupid and selfish that they don't deserve medical care, yet think that such a system would never be abused by the same population you consider brainless?**",,,,1632797618,{},hejtr06,False,t3_pwhyum,False,True,t1_hejq6ah,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pwhyum/i_lost_my_daughter_to_cancer_after_covid_paused/hejtr06/,1632938540.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_78ext,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions. However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

The rural areas of the state might be less vaccinated but they're also less densely populated. I kept an eye on at least one Central IL county this past year since my family lives there, and their county has pretty consistently had low transmission, except for a noticeable spike and several outbreaks when the college kids from Chicagoland came down to attend.

Still think its better to have some projections than to not have them. But there should be projections of the worst plausible case scenarios, which need to be emphasized along side the projections assuming that everything continues as they currently are (which seems like an optimistic scenario). 

Personally, I'm feeling cautiously optimistic about spring next year. I've been pessimistic about outcomes since the start of the pandemic, even through the lows of the summer. Between 3rd doses, vaccination rates of 2-dosers slowly creeping up, OSHA mandating testing (with an exception for the vaccinated), the fact that most antivaxxers will probably have gotten natural immunity by then, and other vaccinations/treatments coming up, it seems unlikely post-winter 2022 will be comparable to 2021 in most places in the US, unless we get a virus that has the transmissibility of Delta plus the immune escape than 351 or Lambda, and an increased death/disease rate. Given the physical limitations the virus has to deal with, at the very least its probably not an easy thing for the virus to accomplish.  

Of course the virus won't be gone then, but hopefully its muted enough that it a secondary issue.

Let's assume the boosters are not significantly harmful (and few are suggesting they are, outside of some who worry about the administration in young men and myocarditis). For simplicity, this means we don't need to worry about a risk/benefit ratio - just the benefit.  

If boosters provide no benefit to people in occupations with relatively low-risk of COVID exposure, they won't provide benefit to people in occupations with relative high-risk either. The issue with low vs. high risk is the magnitude of the benefit. In other words, a beneficial vaccine would be more beneficial for someone with a higher risk job as compared to a lower risk job.

First of all, it depends on what effectiveness you're defining as acceptable. Even then, this is only true if you are only considering severe illness and hospitalization. If you're considering mild and moderate illness as well, the evidence is expansive and solid that they're needed.

&gt;The evidence presented by Pfizer to the FDA and CDC consisted of:

...2 studies? No, the CDC considered numerous others. Many people here watched the meeting, so I don't know what you think you're gaining by lying.

Further, that antibodies are an unsuitable proxy goes against the entire body of current evidence. No, that doesn't mean T and B cell mediated memory systems aren't doing anything, you say you're a physician so I shouldn't have to explain why, but I've got the feeling you don't understand what's going on here. Are you one of ""America's Frontline Physicians""?

&gt;I don't think the boosters are dangerous, but there is no evidence that they will be beneficial for many now receiving them. Meanwhile, parts of Africa won't get widespread access to the vaccine until 2023...

Ah I see the problem. This is primarily a logistical issue and isn't alleviated by allowing mild and moderate infections to run rampant as a noble sacrifice. Other parts of the world we could get to quicker, but remember that's happening as fast as possible. Boosters represent 2 weeks of Pfizer's current production output. Forgoing boosters would have very limited impact between thee small production allocation and the logistical issues dominating it. 

Your downvotes are because so many of us here *are* familiar with the data when you obviously aren't. I don't know why you think the 24 of 33 experts that voted in favor of all this aren't either.

As we’ve seen with vaccine mandated universities here in the US, even 95 to 100 percent vaccine coverage is not enough to prevent transmission. Of course, most of these cases are mild or asymptomatic but are nonetheless found through mass testing. I can’t imagine a world— at least from my perspective— where AUS simply lets the case count climb. 

As an example, NSW, Australia’s biggest state, plans to “open up” with a 70 percent vaccination rate with lessening restrictions as further benchmarks are met.

The biggest WTF to me are the border restrictions. Not allowing citizens to leave— or return, for that matter— without a very difficult to get exemption is really, really weird as an outsider.

German RKI calculated the following:

if only 65% (12-59yo) would vaccinate they expect an incidency of 400 and more than 6.000 intensive care beds, a 75% acceptance would reduce incidency to 150 and 2.000 beds, 85% would keep incidency under 100, 95% under 50 and beds under 1.000

&gt; On the basis of the mathematical models presented here and the results of the surveys on vaccination acceptance, we consider a target vaccination rate (vaccination protection through full vaccination) of 85% for 12–59 year olds and 90% for people aged 60 and over necessary and also achievable. If this vaccination quota is reached in time, a pronounced 4th wave in the coming autumn / winter seems unlikely, provided that the population continues to adhere to the basic hygiene measures in addition to vaccination and, if the number of infections increases again, reduces contacts to a certain extent. https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2021/Ausgaben/27_21.pdf?__blob=publicationFile",,,,1632827692,{},hekyo1x,False,t3_px0qu4,False,True,t1_hekxqm4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/px0qu4/daily_discussion_thread_september_28_2021/hekyo1x/,1632962791.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_15ua46,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;The remote community’s crisis reflects not only the recent collapse of “covid zero” in Australia but also the country’s historical failings.
For 18 months, state and federal leaders had been promising to protect Indigenous Australians, who have higher rates of chronic disease and shorter life expectancies. They were declared a priority for vaccination.

But the survey indicated that nearly three-quarters of unvaccinated Americans view boosters very differently, saying that the need for them shows that the vaccines are not working.

&gt;That divide suggests that while it may be relatively easy to persuade vaccinated people to line up for an additional shot, the need for boosters may complicate public health officials’ efforts to persuade the remaining unvaccinated people to get their initial one.

&gt;Another takeaway from the Kaiser Family Foundation survey: For all the carrots dangled to induce hesitant people to get Covid shots — cash, doughnuts, racetrack privileges — more credit for the recent rise in vaccination goes to the stick. Almost 40 percent of newly inoculated people said that they had sought the vaccines because of the increase in Covid cases, with more than a third saying that they had become alarmed by overcrowding in local hospitals and rising death rates.

&gt;”When a theoretical threat becomes a clear and present danger, people are more likely to act to protect themselves and their loved ones,” said Drew Altman, the Kaiser Family Foundation’s chief executive.

&gt;The nationally representative survey of 1,519 people was conducted from Sept. 13-22 — during a time of surging Covid deaths, but before the government authorized boosters for millions of high-risk people who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, including those 65 and over and adults of any age whose job puts them at high risk of infection.

&gt;Sweeteners did have some role in getting shots in arms. One-third of respondents said that they had gotten vaccinated to travel or attend events where the shots were required.

&gt;Two reasons often cited as important for motivating those hesitant to get a vaccine — employer mandates (about 20 percent) and full federal approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (15 percent) — carried less sway.

&gt;Seventy-two percent of adults in the survey said that they were at least partly vaccinated, up from 67 percent in late July. The latest numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are even higher, reporting 77 percent of the adult population in the United States with at least one shot. The sharpest change in this month was in vaccination rates for Latinos: a jump of 12 percentage points since late July, to 73 percent, in the number of Latino adults who had received at least one shot.

&gt;With the vaccination racial gap narrowing, the political divide has, by far, become the widest, with 90 percent of Democrats saying that they have gotten at least one dose, compared with 58 percent of Republicans.

&gt;Perhaps reflecting pandemic fatigue, about eight in 10 adults said that they believed Covid was now a permanent fixture of the health landscape. Just 14 percent said that they thought “it will be largely eliminated in the U.S., like polio.”

[],,49ersFan4Ever,,,,,,[],"I do agree with you on your general statement about rules, which I will mentioned at the end here.

I don't think anyone honestly thinks that having good math skills translates to debating skills in the first place. I don't know how dialectic, i.e. logic in the human domain, and logic in the math domain could be equivalent or have complimentary overlap in terms of appreciating two or more different answers to the same problem. In this sense the argument could be made that it conditions the math student to choose the (solitary) correct answer.  


In math there is only 1 acceptable answer. If you think about what is happening in math for a moment, we are using rules and formulas in order to work out equivalence or find equilibrium. 

What this means is that math comes down to expressing an equation as being equal to another equation, or value. Which we interpret as the correct answer. To sum it all up in terms of what math is, we can say: 'This Value' = 'That Value'  


Whereas in the human realm; logic, dialogue, debate, etc. there could very well be 2 or more sound arguments or what we would term as 'solutions' to a problem. However, any given solution may only be appropriate in certain contexts or depending on the individual. 

In order to think critically, one must be able to understand all arguments surrounding an issue in terms of its strengths and weaknesses using sound logic. It's far more complex than mathematical operations in this respect, because how many people can actually consider or entertain an idea without feeling compelled to either accept or reject it? Not too many these days! This is an oversimplification and this goes far deeper than what I have time to mention of course.

So in terms of equivalence, I disagree with you. 

However, in terms of a rule set, I agree with you to an extent. Rules for math must be followed or else the entire equation breaks down and the equivalent answer will invariably be objectively incorrect.

Rules for dialogue also exist, but sadly too few were ever taught these rules, and so they remain corrupted in their thinking, incapable of intellectual honesty. It's quite pandemic to be sure. 

So I do agree in a general sense about rules to math, and rules to critical thinking. However, for reasons stated above, these are two disparate rule sets with very little equivalence other than being frameworks for their respective functions. One being determined by objective equivalence (this = that) and the other being the subjectivity of the human experience.",,,,1632792646,{},hejj61q,False,t3_pwb0ko,False,True,t1_heje6j0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pwb0ko/southern_states_reporting_increase_in_stillbirths/hejj61q/,1632932278.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_508dj8mf,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Background Conflicting evidence has emerged regarding the relevance of smoking on risk of COVID-19 and its severity.  
  
Methods We undertook large-scale observational and Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses using UK Biobank. Most recent smoking status was determined from primary care records (70.8%) and UK Biobank questionnaire data (29.2%). COVID-19 outcomes were derived from Public Health England SARS-CoV-2 testing data, hospital admissions data, and death certificates (until 18 August 2020). Logistic regression was used to estimate associations between smoking status and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation, and COVID-19-related death. Inverse variance-weighted MR analyses using established genetic instruments for smoking initiation and smoking heaviness were undertaken (reported per SD increase).  
  
Results There were 421 469 eligible participants, 1649 confirmed infections, 968 COVID-19-related hospitalisations and 444 COVID-19-related deaths. Compared with never-smokers, current smokers had higher risks of hospitalisation (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.29) and mortality (smoking 1–9/day: OR 2.14, 95% CI 0.87 to 5.24; 10–19/day: OR 5.91, 95% CI 3.66 to 9.54; 20+/day: OR 6.11, 95% CI 3.59 to 10.42). In MR analyses of 281 105 White British participants, genetically predicted propensity to initiate smoking was associated with higher risks of infection (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.91) and hospitalisation (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.27). Genetically predicted higher number of cigarettes smoked per day was associated with higher risks of all outcomes (infection OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.20 to 5.24; hospitalisation OR 5.08, 95% CI 2.04 to 12.66; and death OR 10.02, 95% CI 2.53 to 39.72).

Essentially it’s because for over 65s for every 462 people who get a booster, 1 hospitalization is prevented. For 18-29s, it takes 8,738 boosters to prevent 1 hospitalization. For approximately every 100 booster shots, 1 infection is prevented. Which is a lot of vaccines and would strain supply for not much reward.

There is also a higher risk of myocarditis (enlarged heart) with younger people, risk is unknown and they are playing it safe (slide 15) as the risk is increased for a booster but is still 26 in 1 million.

The slides don’t discuss whether it will affect the likelihood of the unvaccinated from getting one (as they shouldn’t, such people love to talk about “freedom”, it’s their free choice to not get one at this point and their stubbornness shouldn’t hold the rest of us back).

The CDC recommendation is out there but it’s not hard to get a booster if you want one - and there’s an excess of supply and open appointments in the US so I don’t feel it is unethical to get one.

The US public private partnerships tend to result in one sided gains for Private corporations at the expense of american public health. See high fructose corn syrup. Or regulations on filming meat production. 

This has resulted in a public health crisis for black americans. 

So the first step is, what is private corporate motivations for the companies involved? Did the US government uphold public interest in making sure health outcomes were considered for all citizens? 

There were early fears that heart problems were arising from the vaccines. Black americans have long family histories with heart problems. What caused these issues and have they remained? How were the early fears handled? 

The vaccine was created in ""record"" time. How was that done? Were their any shortcuts in the process? Where did the ideas for this vaccine originate?

The Trump administration was implicated in a number of ways in meddling with the CDC response to this pandemic. Did they do anything self serving to affect development of this vaccine? Did they meddle with the process? 


**Its not about scholarly research detailing the ingredients and development of this vaccine. Its about researching the private corporate and public institutional motivations that facilitated its development. Its the type of research I did from January to June when I got fully vaccinated. The US has a history of sidelining the concerns of Black Americans that have led to a number of adverse health outcomes in heart disease, diabetes and obesity. The FDA is not our best friend. The Trump administration has done a number of things that have been vindictive to spurn black american progress. Its not unfathomable that we'd be hesistant.** 

**If you're really concerned about the entire public's health please don't mock good faith efforts to reason out the motivations of private and public institutions who have shown a history of disregarding black american health. Point people in a good direction for how they can get beyond that mistrust. And for the future advocate for increased access to general practice doctors, health facilities, and health and science education so that there is no longer a gap in trust.**

Dr. Kizzy has been a key advocate that offers good faith arguments to relieve mistrust in public and private institutions

I got over my fears when I realized the sensationalized media coverage about this ""record"" vaccine was based on research from 10 years ago around the MERS Virus. 
The genome sequencing of the virus, something that couldn't have been done at the time I was born and something perfected in the last decade has allowed for teams around the world to collaborate in decentralized ways. 

The innovative delivery of this vaccine, not from a dead copy of the virus, but from the RNA of the spike protein that the body can ""practice against"" was amazing and helped me understand the incredible wonder of this vaccine.  Not its ""record time"". 

**Lastly, I got vaccinated with Pfizer. I respect Germany's global leadership and while Pfizer is a private corporation, at least its accountable to more stringent EU regulation if there is malevolent, selfish motivations.**

There's also some accounts that the silicone leaves an invisible a residue over months or years that will contribute a mildly hydroscopic film that helps dispersal in the long run (and skips a need for only marginally justifiable products like RainX). At any rate, silicone blades last longer and work better.  Buy $6 blades biannually, or $25 blades biennialy (or triennially).

It's not oil, your car won't explode if you miss the maintenance schedule on the wipers. They have a useful life, but they will start to streak before they catastrophically fail. If they start to streak, clean them. If they steak after a good cleaning, replace them ASAP. Smeared rain distorting headlights at night is no joke.

The first human clinical trial using ex vivo dendritic cells transfected with mRNA encoding tumor antigens (therapeutic cancer mRNA vaccine) was started in 2001.[26][27] Four years later, the successful use of modified nucleosides as a method to transport mRNA inside cells without setting off the body's defense system was reported.[26][28] Clinical trial results of an mRNA vaccine directly injected into the body against cancer cells were reported in 2008.[29][30]

BioNTech in 2008 and Moderna in 2010 were founded to develop mRNA biotechnologies.[31][32] The US research agency DARPA launched at this time the biotechnology research program ADEPT to develop emerging technologies for the US military.[33][34] The agency recognized the potential of nucleic acid technology for defense against pandemics and began to invest in the field.[33] DARPA grants were seen as a vote of confidence that in turn encouraged other government agencies and private investors to invest in mRNA technology.[34] DARPA awarded at the time a $25 million grant to Moderna.[35]

The first human clinical trials using an mRNA vaccine against an infectious agent (rabies) began in 2013.[36][37] Over the next few years, clinical trials of mRNA vaccines for a number of other viruses were started. mRNA vaccines for human use have been studied for infectious agents such as, influenza, Zika virus, cytomegalovirus, and Chikungunya virus.*",,,,1632846010,{},hem0qwl,False,t3_px3gtp,False,True,t1_hel7lcl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/px3gtp/new_york_hospitals_fire_suspend_staff_who_refuse/hem0qwl/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_y1qut,False,False,,False,f4ccf2c63f938f116913e1fd80692a5458b7ede9,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1632846022.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Do you have to pay for those vaccines? They're provided for free here, so that's why only certain groups get them.

In the U.S. they are generally free I think but I'm not sure.  Since there's more of a tier structure for health costs based on employment I'm not completely sure which vaccines are government-sponsored and which ones are paid for by insurance.  In general, our pediatrician recommended us to get flu shots every year so we get them.  Also my employer brings in people around this time of the year to give free flu shots to those that want them.

&gt; The UK's JCVI is a completely apolitical group of scientists who are in charge of recommending vaccinations. They considered only the effects to an individual teenager and since the benefit of the vaccine was so marginal didn't recommend that they be given it.

I think from my standpoint, if it doesn't *hurt* I don't see the problem with giving children the vaccines.  It feels like there should be different standards for different situations.  In a pandemic, if something *might* have a positive outcome with no real risks I'd be in favor of approving it.  If it were a situation for example with an acne medication that might not work, I would want it to be studied further before approving it.

&gt; They didn't factor in other things like whether they will have to self-isolate or its effect on society.

In the U.S. this is the role of the CDC rather than the FDA and where I feel like the FDA stepped out of their job description on the booster shots.  I don't know if you have a similar setup in the UK where another group is responsible for taking the public health and other factors into consideration.  Some of those other factors that we have that I don't think are a concern in the UK are things like how mask mandates are banned and mask-wearing is discouraged in some schools, no social distancing is being encouraged much less enforced, and there are no requirements to even report COVID cases much less do any sort of temporary online schooling in the event that there is a major outbreak in a classroom.

&gt; I was just trying to point out that Covid is not particularly dangerous at an individual level, but it is absolutely terrifying at an epidemiological one. Which is why vaccinating children won't make a significant difference. It distracts from what the actual issue is and gets people's hopes up that it will somehow be better after it's done.

I think this is a matter of perspective, which is why I wrote such a long explanation going into more about the disconnect between the levels of government in the U.S.  I assume that the UK isn't federalized to the same degree so you've been able to have more of a unified response.  There's a lot of other issues that fall outside the realm of public health that are contributing to the problems though and that gets more off topic.  However, all of that adds up to a situation where people feel forced to focus on their individual health as opposed to the overall common good.",,,,1632845643,{},helzur0,False,t3_pwg24r,False,True,t1_helx6xm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pwg24r/in_a_matter_of_days_pfizer_ceo_says_theyll_be/helzur0/,1632982721.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_foh8k,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,HolyAnole,,,,,,[],"The FDA requested a larger sample because of concerns about myocarditis, so Pfizer had to wait to increase the sample. From what I understand, the additional sample (1,000 kids, I think) didn’t increase the total sample to a size sufficient to really turn up enough cases of a rare adverse event to add much to the understanding of safety.  Even if the risk is higher than what was shown in the smaller sample, that shouldn’t affect decision-making on EUA approval or for individuals when myocarditis occurs more often among unvaccinated people who get Covid, unless there’s a specific group of kids for whom the risks outweigh the benefits—which, if it exists, is probably way too small to identify in the trial data gathered so far.   

I’m pissed that the delay has made for a horribly stressful, dangerous start to the school year without likely uncovering any new risks.  I wonder if one consideration in the FDA’s demand for more data was being able to reassure vaccine-hesitant parents that they did, in fact, take a closer look at the myocarditis risk.  If that was they case, they should have let parents who are desperate to protect their kids from Covid exposure at school vaccinate their kids sooner while the hesitant parents wait it out since those same parents would wait anyway.  Knowing families who have vaccinated their kids is probably far more compelling to them than a larger sample size. 

When all of this is said and done, I hope that the FDA and CDC are pressured to rethink how they approach things and realize they have to account for human behavior and get way better at communication.

Will it harm them? No. But it is not going to provide significant benefit, because they don't really need it. This is not a controversial thing to say. It is why the UK's vaccination committee didn't recommend that 12-18 year olds get vaccinated, since it provides a relatively marginal benefit to them.

The whole pandemic has been about protecting the health system. It was never about protecting yourself, your children or your parents, since for the most part the majority do recover. It was about ensuring that the health system doesn't collapse and can still provide care for other people. It is unvaccinated adults (including young ones, just in case you think that I don't think they should be vaccinated) who are responsible for that.

Americans just seem to be thinking that vaccinating children will suddenly change the situation. It won't. Will it have a negative effect? No. But it's benefit is so small in the face of overwhelming hospitalisations from adults. The response still seems so individualistic. ""Oh well my family is vaccinated, so we're fine.""

Quite the contrary.  The ones who I've assumed have been sitting on their hands have been the FDA.

&gt;Much of the existing research into the condition – a mixture of symptoms reported by people often months after they were originally ill with Covid-19 – has been based either on self-reported symptoms or small studies.

&gt;Now researchers at the University of Oxford, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) have shed fresh light on the scale of the problem after studying more than 270,000 people recovering from coronavirus in the US.

&gt;They found 37% of patients had at least one long Covid symptom diagnosed three to six months after infection. The most common symptoms were breathing problems, abdominal symptoms, fatigue, pain and anxiety or depression.

&gt;“The results confirm that a significant proportion of people, of all ages, can be affected by a range of symptoms and difficulties in the six months after Covid-19 infection,” said NIHR academic clinical fellow Dr Max Taquet. “Over one-third of patients were diagnosed with at least one of the long Covid symptoms between three and six months after their Covid-19 illness.”

&gt;Severity of infection, age, and sex affected the likelihood of long Covid symptoms, according to the data from the US-based TriNetX electronic health record network.

[],,OldheadBoomer,,,,,,[],"Since you're serious with your question, here's a serious, non-condescending answer. :)

The virus likes to replicate. The only defense we have against its replication is our immune system. The vaccine trains our immune system to recognize the virus so it can react more quickly when virus particles enter our system.

The virus isn't very smart, it will replicate and replicate, often to the point of killing its host. If you think of the virus as a mass of tiny particles, a quantity if you will - it should be easy to figure out why someone who is vaccinated would have far fewer virus particles on and in them than someone who is unvaccinated. The vaccinated host's immune system is working more efficiently and therefore that host has fewer virus particles to spread around. 

And that's the important part: it's simple math that if you reduce the number of virus particles in the environment, then you reduce the probability that someone will sniff one up and get sick. All the measures to reduce the spread are based on basic math and science. the 6-foot/2-meter distancing for example, relies on the [inverse square law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law) where the quantity of virus particles present in the air is proportional to the square of the distance, so as you move further away you dramatically reduce the number of particles in space through dilution.

So we take multiple steps - distancing, killing the virus on surfaces via sanitation, and yes, wearing masks (which by the way are meant to reduce the particles in the air *just like these other methods*).

The vaccine gives our immune system a head start, basically by taking away the analysis and trial-and-error portions of responding to a foreign pathogen like the virus. This is the best way to reduce the number of virus particles in the environment (along with masks, distancing, etc.) and by reducing the particles, you reduce the potential for spread until it reaches a point where the virus is eliminated in large swaths of the population (which also makes it easier to manage in areas where its still present).

TL/DR: By not being vaccinated, a person has the potential to contribute many more virus particles to his environment, which in turn means it's easier for other people to inhale the virus where it can multiply.",,,,1632799363,{},hejx854,False,t3_pwnzza,False,False,t1_hej3f50,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pwnzza/nba_legend_kareem_abduljabbar_calls_for/hejx854/,1632940564.0,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_4xjf9tpx,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In one case, this was an integral part of the development, in the other it was something that happened decades after the development when the drug had been in widespread use already. If someone took aspirin to treat a headache in the 1960s, it would be hard to justify it being unethical for them to do so in 2021, even if you object to testing using fetal stem cells.

The point that the objection is not sincere is accurate, but pointing to aspirin and Tums is a dubious argument for that point. A better example would be Regeneron monoclonal antibodies, which have been embraced by anti-vaxxers but clearly did use fetal cells lines during development. Probably several of the other examples listed by OP are valid as well.

The point here is that there's no need to resort to dubious arguments in favor of the vaccine when the actual arguments in favor of it are so strong.

As long as there are vaccine-hesitant people out there, we'll never reach the critical threshold necessary to reduce the effective reproduction number to 1, which means masking, social distancing and good hygiene will still be required to control the spread.

However, if these four measures can be supplemented by oral antivirals for those who test positive--both unvaccinated persons and the smaller number of breakthrough cases among those who are fully vaccinated--then we can reduce the likelihood positive cases will spread.

Control the spread so each infection causes one (or fewer) infections on average and we can re-open society while easing up on some of the more invasive measures (such as masks mandates).

Stipulating what you said about the PHSA, the language you quoted was extremely non-descript, and I’m really not sure if that law itself (or this section) has been litigated enough to test the limits of the powers granted by that legislation, and/or that specific section.

None of the tests are made for that. Antibody test tests if have had covid, so it should be positive afterwards.

This is true, but still the wrong way to look at it.  If you are using vaccination rate to talk about *attitudes*, then that rate should be for eligible people only.  Right now only 25% of eligible people have not received at least one dose.

Your number is larger mostly because you are counting the people who are not yet eligible for the vaccine.

I agree with you I think this is probably the last major wave in the US.

The degree of future waves will be driven by the level of vaccination in each area, and I think it will vary a lot by locality. I'm in the DC metro area which has very high rates of vaccination, but if you drive an hour or two you're in a rural area where it is very low. So I am going to predict rolling waves and outbreaks in the rural areas while the population centers are largely unaffected.

The early numbers are of course unreliable because testing was atrocious those days. The case numbers post May 2020 are probably more accurate than other nations.

China screen their high risk workers regularly and test everyone with Covid symptoms in the general population. As soon as one positive case is found, their whole neighborhood goes into lockdown. Not Western lockdown, the kind of ""you can't leave your home, we will deliver groceries to you"" kind of lockdown, and everyone get tested. If they cannot trace a source or if cases keep increasing, the whole city goes into lockdown. Only essential workers like hospital staff and delivery people are allowed to leave their homes. The whole city get tested, usually two or three times over. China have done this with 6 or 7 cities so far. The latest is Fujian in early September. 

Whenever someone test positive, they go into a hospital or observation facility, whether they are symptomatic or not, whether they want to or not.

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in key antibody epitopes has raised concerns that antigenic evolution will erode immunity. The susceptibility of immunity to viral evolution is shaped in part by the breadth of epitopes targeted. Here we compare the specificity of antibodies elicited by the mRNA-1273 vaccine versus natural infection. The neutralizing activity of vaccine-elicited antibodies is even more focused on the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) than for infection-elicited antibodies. However, within the RBD, binding of vaccine-elicited antibodies is more broadly distributed across epitopes than for infection-elicited antibodies. This greater binding breadth means single RBD mutations have less impact on neutralization by vaccine sera than convalescent sera. Therefore, antibody immunity acquired by different means may have differing susceptibility to erosion by viral evolution.

One Sentence Summary: Deep mutational scanning shows the mRNA-1273 RBD-binding antibody response is less affected by single viral mutations than the infection response.",,,,1632862464,{},hen3zhk,False,t3_px72ns,False,True,t1_helkz0p,/r/Coronavirus/comments/px72ns/immune_imprinting_and_vaccine_design/hen3zhk/,1633002297.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_9np1cfb,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She cried a lot before. And hid in the corner of the Dr office and I had to pull her to my lap.   
And she kept crying even after it was over and didn't realize that she had already received it.  
Then stopped crying like 5 seconds later and said, yeah I guess the small shots are not that bad.

The obvious reason of course is the various social distancing practices, masking, shut-downs, etc. These locally reduced flu, though as we all know compliance varied greatly on a region to region basis.  
But there was *also* an almost complete moratorium on international travel. This had universal compliance because if you wanted to go to, say, South America it didn't matter if your town in Florida didn't take Covid seriously. The airline didn't have flights and the countries weren't accepting foreigners.

We should let them off the hook of improving their protection and also risk others intentionally infecting themselves overloading the system why exactly?

What’s your rationale for saying this? That Pfizer is the only one that needs a booster right now? So when Moderna gets the authorization, will that change your mind?

Because Pfizer is also the only one right now with full FDA approval.

If you’re going off of the previous story about Moderna providing better protection, simply because they administered a higher dosage than Pfizer, the dose tested on 5-11 for this vaccine is the same dosage that Moderna is testing on this age group as well.

So honest answer: Most parents who don’t treat their kids as a billboard for their own political beliefs and indoctrinate them have that primal, paternal instinct to protect their children. You don’t want your kids sick, PERIOD. You’re asking about “returning to normal”, so I assume you mean not wearing masks, etc. Such measures are simple to parents who feel this and most certainly wouldn’t want them to get sick for their own selfish intents because they don’t want to wear masks anymore and return to normal.

Medical Surgery unit is already going to close over 70 beds and probably more if these 2,000 nurses are fired. There are also labs all across the state that have closed because of no staffing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not against the mandate completely. I would prefer nurses to be vaccinated. However, I think it was handled horribly. In the short term, hospitals are going to be understaffed to a dangerous level. I wish that they would have given hospitals more time to prepare and be able to bring in more staff to prepare for this. At the absolute peak of the pandemic they told hospitals that they basically have less than a month to get everyone vaccinated and that isn't even close to enough time to be able to bring in and train staff to replace the people they are going to have to fire. So now not only are they short staffed, but their quality of nurses are going to go down as well (obviously an argument can be made that not getting vaccinated is a pretty big mark on your quality of being a nurse).

And I just want to be clear that I am not against vaccinating children. It however is not going to change much in terms of the public health crisis in the US. 

The UK's JCVI is a completely apolitical group of scientists who are in charge of recommending vaccinations. They considered only the effects to an individual teenager and since the benefit of the vaccine was so marginal didn't recommend that they be given it. They didn't factor in other things like whether they will have to self-isolate or its effect on society.

We are most certainly trying to protect lives.

&gt;	Misinformation is with the intent to deceive

No it isn’t, that’s *disinformation*. There’s a difference. 

&gt;	**What is misinformation?**

&gt;Misinformation is “false information that is spread, **regardless of intent to mislead**.” Put a flag in the second half of this definition; it will be important later.

&gt;The spread of misinformation happens often in our everyday lives. We human beings—news flash—are not perfect. We can all make mistakes. We all forget things. We mishear or misremember details. We tell our friends something we heard on TV or saw on social media that wasn’t really true. If you are spreading around information that is wrong but you don’t know it is wrong, then you are, well, technically, spreading misinformation.


&gt;	**What is disinformation?**

&gt;Disinformation means “false information, as about a country’s military strength or plans, disseminated by a government or intelligence agency in a hostile act of tactical political subversion.” It is also used more generally to mean “**deliberately misleading or biased information**; manipulated narrative or facts; propaganda.”

Former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on Monday the COVID-19 delta wave, which is finally slowing in many regions after weeks of rising cases, could be the “last major surge” in the U.S.  
“On the back end of this delta wave, I do think this is the last major surge of infection, barring something unexpected like a new variant coming along that pierces the immunity offered by vaccination or prior infection,” Gottlieb told CNN.   
Still, the former FDA commissioner cautioned that he expects the delta variant will still strike northern areas of the U.S. harder in the coming weeks, following widespread outbreaks in the South and Midwest.   
“I think by Thanksgiving, it's probably going to have run its course across the whole country,” he said. “But it's going to seep into the northern parts of the country, the Northeast a little bit later than certainly in the South but even in the Midwest.”  
Cases have declined nationwide by 18 percent in two weeks, but the former commissioner noted that drops in the South’s case count are driving the decrease after delta “aggressively” spread in the region.  
Gottlieb said officials are documenting rising cases in other areas of the country, particularly the Midwest and parts of the Pacific Northwest.  
“So prevalence should decline on the back end of this delta wave, and hopefully we get back to more of a semblance of normalcy, especially when vaccines hopefully will be available for children as well,” he added.   
Pfizer is expected to submit its data for vaccines in children under 12 in a matter of days, and Gottlieb said the FDA could decide on approval in four to six weeks.  
The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention has estimated the delta strain to account for about 98 percent of all COVID-19 cases in the U.S. throughout September.  
The highly transmissible strain hit the South particularly hard over the summer, with a rapid spread of infection and the vast majority of hospitalizations and deaths occurring among the unvaccinated.",,,,1632844090,{},helw2co,True,t3_px97j1,False,False,t3_px97j1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/px97j1/gottlieb_covid19_delta_wave_could_be_last_major/helw2co/,1632980836.0,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_4ts3jbfm,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Look at the actual rates of 1st dose vaccinations over time.

But you look back at July when vaccine mandates were definitely not looming and you can see a big uptick in vaccinations.  Why?  Because that's when Delta talk started.  Many people thought they could skate by on ""herd immunity,"" but Delta made that obvious it wouldn't happen, so people went and got vaccianted.


Also worth pointing out this line from the article:

&gt;and why most say they will get boosters when eligible

This survey is off the whole population, not just newly vaccinated individuals.

[],,hannahsflora,,,,,,[],"I think we're seeing signs that this current Delta wave is going to be the last big one, the last ""kick in the nuts"" as I saw another Redditor aptly describe it the other day. 

Even though vaccines aren't as effective against Delta as they were/are against Alpha, they DO still very much matter in the overall picture, and areas with higher vaccination rates just don't give the virus nearly as much room to work with versus areas with lower vaccination percentages. 

When I look at the stats for my state, Ohio, and filter a map of the state to show cases over the last month and compare that to a vaccination map of the state, the areas that have seen the heaviest outbreaks in this wave line up almost perfectly to the counties that have the lowest vaccination rates. They're also almost all rural areas that didn't get hit as hard in the first waves when it was running through the cities and more densely populated areas. 

So to answer your question - I think we are absolutely seeing the point that vaccination rates + prior waves/infections matter. I do believe that we'll see some localized swells/small waves in the US for the next several months, but I am very inclined to believe that once this wave fully recedes, we will not see another one comparable to this again.",,,,1632835981,{},heldaoa,False,t3_px0qu4,False,False,t1_hekxqm4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/px0qu4/daily_discussion_thread_september_28_2021/heldaoa/,1632970968.0,16,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_5rg9zcsm,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've seen a number of reports on hybrid immunity. They appear to have looked at data for people who were first infected by Covid and then later received the vaccine. 

With breakthrough infections rampant (I  know this first hand; fully vaccinated along with 6 other coworkers and we all got delta from a non-symptomatic carrier within about 2 days of exposure, 75% of us masked and socially distanced at work). I'm curious if any peer reviewed studies have emerged that confirm (or show a difference) in hybrid immunity outcomes based on the reverse order (vaccinated first, then infected). 

I found one study seemingly from India that hinted at data confirming that order wasn't important, the results were the same - but it wasn't a site I was familiar with, so looking for anything more reliable than that, if it exists yet (or if a study is underway, would love to know that so I can track it).

The simple fact is that the scientific evidence in favor of giving boosters to middle-aged and young, healthy adults is virtually non-existent.

The evidence presented by Pfizer to the FDA and CDC consisted of:

1. A 306 person, non-randomized ""trial"" with an historical control (i.e. everyone got the booster - there was no placebo arm), and used an imperfect surrogate outcome (antibody titers).  If you think that antibody titers should be sufficient for a vaccine endpoint to demonstrate degree of immunity, then ask why isn't the presence of antibodies in a person's blood sufficient to exclude them from a vaccine mandate?

And BTW, 6 people had to be excluded from the above analysis because they received the wrong booster. (Doesn't exactly inspire confidence)


2. An observational study (i.e. not a clinical trial) in Israel that only involved people over 60, and which found dramatic benefit from a booster starting within 1 day from having received it, which is not biologically plausible, demonstrating significant bias - likely selection bias based on behavioral differences between those who choose to get the booster and those who did not.


I don't think the boosters are dangerous, but there is no evidence that they will be beneficial for many now receiving them.

&gt; California continues to have the lowest levels of coronavirus transmission in the country, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
&gt;
&gt; On Monday, the agency’s color-coded map showed California as having a “moderate” level of virus transmission, represented by yellow, with 48 other states stuck in the “high” transmission category, labeled red, and Connecticut advancing into the second-worst “substantial” tier, marked orange.
&gt;
&gt; However, data published on Mondays can sometimes be off due to reporting irregularities over the weekend. Ali Bay, a spokesman for the California Department of Public Health, said that the state believes that the updated data would show that California is still technically in the orange category since data on cases are not reported on weekends.
&gt;
&gt; Nonetheless, cases and hospitalizations have sharply declined in California as the state emerges on the other side of a sharp surge driven by the highly transmissible delta variant of the virus.
&gt;
&gt; “California has the lowest COVID case rate in the country. The data doesn’t lie —vaccines work,” Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office tweeted on Monday.
&gt;
&gt; Health experts have long credited California’s success to the state’s higher than average vaccination rates and thoughtful virus mitigation measures, including mask and vaccine mandates.
&gt;
&gt; The state has yet to return to the “low” tier of COVID transmission, represented by blue on the map. It last achieved that in June.
&gt;
&gt; The state’s virus positivity rate has dropped to 2.6% over the past eight weeks, the health department reports. About 59% of the population is vaccinated against COVID-19, slightly higher than the U.S. average of 57%.
&gt;
&gt; The Bay Area is doing significantly better than California as a whole.
&gt;
&gt; According to state data analyzed by The Chronicle, the Bay Area’s seven-day average daily case rate per 100,000 was nearly 40% better than California’s as a whole. Marin County has the lowest seven-day case rate in the state, followed by San Mateo County and Santa Clara County — with Alameda County, Sonoma County and San Francisco not far behind.
&gt;
&gt; Note: This story has been updated with comments from the California Department of Health, which believes the state is still in the “substantial” transmission tier due to a weekend reporting lag.

[],,Umpass-stay,,,,,,[],"Happy to see you on your journey to self-care and protection. I also have bad health anxiety. I got vaccinated at my first possible opportunity, but I'll admit I was anxious. All the reassurance in the world from doctors and medical establishments can't quiet 100% of the worry haha. The feeling of relief immediately after getting the vaccine is so overwhelming in a positive way. You'll sit there for 15 minutes (they make everyone do this with every kind of shot), then walk away feeling proud of yourself and optimistic about the future.

Just a word of warning - side effects are perfectly normal and to expected. After my second and third shots, I had cold/flu symptoms for about two days. This included fever, chills at night, muscle soreness all over, a headache, and virtually no appetite. I had worse side effects than anyone else I know. This is 100% normal, absolutely nothing to worry about, and PALES in comparison to the sense of relief and happiness I felt after getting vaccinated. If you don't have these side effects, that's also no cause for concern. The vaccine is still working. Your body just isn't giving you an attitude lol.

As for myocarditis, yes, it has happened in a minuscule amount of people. There are no verified deaths, nor are there verified cases of lasting or permanent damage. There are like one or two suspected reports that pop up if you go out of your way to look for them, but nothing is verified. What we do know for sure is that an incredibly tiny percentage of people who get one of the mRNA vaccines will have some heart inflammation as their body's immune system kicks in. This either goes away on its own very quickly, or, if you feel the need to seek medical care, is treated quickly and efficiently with simple anti-inflammatories. Googling Myocarditis is scary because, in most medical settings, in can represent a larger problem or a lifelong ailment - the myocarditis (literally heart inflammation) we talk about when we talk about mRNA vaccines is not at this level. Per all the data we have, it is overwhelmingly minor, short-lived, and self-resolving.

And preventing any illness or injury during a pandemic is a very good idea.

It is necessary for a variety of functions from calcium absorption for bone, teeth, and muscle health to depression and mood regulation.
A huge chunk of my country is deficient (40% generally, 80% in some segments of the population), many people should be supplementing.  And no, a few minutes of sun assuming you can get your boss to let you out at midday isn’t sufficient to produce our own given our latitudes, weather, and outdoor activity patterns, and high melanin levels in large segments of the population.

Most of them need to take it for its many essential functions.

My gyno of all people strongly suggested I start supplementing when she ran bloodwork and my levels were somewhat low.  That one minor change of adding 1,000iu per day, for me, accidentally cured a decades long pattern of seasonal depression and cut my yearly respiratory illnesses by a huge margin.  Same job, same diet, same activity patterns, same flu vaccine habits of the past fifteen years and starting that year I went from 3-5 colds/RIs to about 1 per year for the next 5 years until covid hit.

[],,Synonyms26,,,,,,[],"HÀ NỘI — HCM City’s health department said there are about 150,000 positive COVID-19 cases detected through rapid antigen tests that have not been accounted for in the national tally.  
  
Explaining how these cases had not been granted an identification number in the health ministry’s records, Nguyễn Văn Vĩnh Châu, deputy head of HCM City’s health department, on Monday said that the protocol was that only cases confirmed through RT-PCR diagnostics were officially considered positive cases.  
  
During the peak of the outbreak in HCM City, the country's COVID-19 epicentre, both rapid antigen tests and RT-PCR tests have been deployed throughout the city depending on the perceived risks of each area, and all positive cases found through antigen tests were considered as confirmed COVID-19 patients and got treated accordingly, instead of waiting for the confirmation from the much more time-consuming lab tests.  
  
All of them were quarantined – either moved into centralised quarantine facilities or allowed to self-isolate at homes if conditions met, in which cases, local governments would bring medical packages to them.  
  
The city’s health department already had these ""unconfirmed"" cases in its logs but had not yet submitted them to the health ministry, and it was proposing the ministry add the cases to the national database.  
  
If all these 150,000 cases are added to the national tally, Việt Nam’s official COVID-19 case count would surpass 900,000 (the country has logged 766,051 infections as of the end of Monday), almost 60 per cent of which detected are in HCM City with more than 525,000 cases.  
  
Châu said that the addition would also significantly bring down the country’s case-fatality ratio (CFR) to 2 per cent, instead of the currently 2.5 per cent – which the health ministry in their daily reports have noted to be much higher than the global average of 2.1 per cent.  
  
On Tuesday, the health ministry has responded to the HCM City’s proposal, saying that on August 20, their special standing task force on COVID-19 to HCM City directed the City’s COVID-19 Prevention and Control Committee to register positive cases found through rapid antigen tests as confirmed cases if they are told to self-isolate at home.  
  
Confirmatory RT-PCR tests would be done on cases that are sent to centralised quarantine facilities, and the daily figures that the city sends to the health ministry for national tallying are supposed to include the positive rapid test cases.  
  
The health ministry also told HCM City’s health department to clarify the exact figures, the total positive rapid tests, the number of patients self-isolating at homes and the number of patients confirmed positive again through RT-PCR before they are sent to medical facilities/centralised quarantine facilities.  
  
The ministry asked HCM City's health department to have an explanation on the belatedness in asking for guidance from the ministry and issues in case reportage.— VNS",,,,1632840419,{},helna3v,True,t3_px7yum,False,True,t3_px7yum,/r/Coronavirus/comments/px7yum/vietnam_150000_positive_rapid_covid19_tests_not/helna3v/,1632976396.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_10wdsu,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although [the adult vaccine schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/adult.html), which shows the same for some vaccines, is probably more relevant as some vaccines are given to children very young for protection when very young and then given to them again when they're a bit older assuming their immune system has forgotten about the first dosing.",,,,1632848261,{},hem68hx,False,t3_px4cne,False,False,t1_helasuz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/px4cne/unvaccinated_americans_say_the_need_for_booster/hem68hx/,1632985841.0,17,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],[],text,t2_44dk6lcn,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From my perspective that sounds insane because we've always given flu and chicken pox vaccines to kids at least as long as I've been a parent.  It's non-controversial here.  As far as COVID is concerned, I know some kids who have gotten it and had a rough time so I don't think it's accurate to say that they're at ""such low risk"" when I personally know kids that have been reduced to 70% of their lung capacity or another who spent a few weeks in the hospital this spring and still gets headaches (both of these are student athletes by the way.)

&gt; It is why the UK's vaccination committee didn't recommend that 12-18 year olds get vaccinated

I don't live in the U.K. or really like them so I can't say that I have investigated their justification for it.

&gt; The whole pandemic has been about protecting the health system.

The health system doesn't exist in a vacuum.  While I agree that it's critical, what is the point of having a healthcare system if not to actually help individuals with health problems?

&gt; It was never about protecting yourself, your children or your parents, since for the most part the majority do recover.

I lost two grandparents to COVID, so I can't take a cold, calculating stance on it.  So many people have lost loved ones, the death toll has surpassed the 1918 flu in the U.S., so if we're not trying to save lives and prevent chronic illnesses then what's the point?

&gt; But it's benefit is so small in the face of overwhelming hospitalisations from adults.

I don't like this either, but these adults *want* to do this.  It's not that they're just struggling to make time to get the shots or that they're the victims of some conspiracy creating a vaccine shortage.  The shots are plentiful in the U.S. and we're the nation donating the most vaccines around the world yet we're still throwing them away constantly.

&gt; The response still seems so individualistic. ""Oh well my family is vaccinated, so we're fine."" It's pretty irrelevant since at an individual level, you have always been relatively safe.

What choice do I have?  I live in a society where the federal government is slow moving but is trying to get people vaccinated, the state government is making it hard to not just get people vaccinated but also opposing mask requirements, social distancing, etc.  The local government is pretty ineffective because of the state sabotaging them whenever they try to do something to help the situation.  On top of that, a significant but loud minority of people not only refuse to be vaccinated, but are becoming more physically violent against anyone that wants to take any sort of precautions.  We are completely on our own in this pandemic at this time.

Perhaps a better way to state it would be that I don't live in a society anymore, I live in America where too many people are so delusional that they are unwilling to even protect their own lives from COVID much less that of others.  The irony is that my wife and I are both dual citizens to other countries, and we're thinking really hard about going to somewhere that doesn't feel like everything is falling apart and that we can be a part of a community that is unified on public health and all other sorts of things.  In America we're sitting ducks not just for COVID but for a whole host of other things and it's tiring.",,,,1632843905,{},helvm53,False,t3_pwg24r,False,True,t1_helr3w6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pwg24r/in_a_matter_of_days_pfizer_ceo_says_theyll_be/helvm53/,1632980615.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_foh8k,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I understand it seeming that way, but you’ll have to forgive me as - in comparison to the deadbeat father she originally had who abandoned her and my sister after her diagnosis - yeah, im a bit arrogant in thinking I do a better job parenting her than her actual father. I also didn’t realize that primal parenting instincts only can happen if the kid actually came from your own loins, but im pretty sure most adoptive parents would disagree with your assessment.

&gt;	your approach is disingenuously omniscient &amp; offputting

Perhaps it was, but it’s hard to not to jump to specific assumptions and conclusions when initial responses are posed as “does vaccinated young kids matter to go back to normal life” or “so you’re not a parent either?”. Especially on Reddit and this particular thread when you’re never exactly sure who you’re dealing with and what angle they’re coming at you from, it’s in my opinion a valid approach in discourse to resort to specific assumptions and defensiveness when questions are posed in a way that lack context and can come off as an attempt at strawmanning or whataboutism.

Which is why I provided context and apologized in the follow up comment to the person I commented to, and why I’m commenting back to you. Context is important and it provides clarity and can lead to rational and proper discourse if done genuinely.

This makes nurses vulnerable to misinformation. For instance, there's a publication up right now about serum vitamin D levels supposedly correlating with an almost protective effect from death with covid infection. Someone who's used to taking conclusions and running with them might take a ""finding"" like that and think supplementing vit D is a ""natural"" way to protect from death without a vaccine. Spoiler though, the author's conclusion is unfounded because the correlation is not statistically significant, not to mention even if it were the finding hasn't been repeated. But it's still helping fuel millions of people to reject the vaccine who think they're practically as smart as doctors because they're ""doing their own research"" because they can find a (pre-)publication from an author with an unfounded conclusion.

There are places that aren't doing a good job providing shots to people like that, whether it's because they don't have free shots that .wet you where you are, they didn't pay for your transportation costs, or they don't do a good enough job letting people know those programs exist. Also, lack of 2-3 days universal PTO per shot even for contract workers is needed so people can get paid for the days they'll miss. Also, few places have tried direct payments, but even a $100 payment was enough to motivate a large uptick in vaccination, especially among young people who are just apathetic, not anti-vax. 3 days PTO is at least $150 for full time workers, but they could easily do a full stimulus check dependent on being vaccinated. 

Mandates are not the only thing that will work and firing people for not complying causes its own issues. It's much cheaper to pay people $1000 for a shot than to cover the cost of hiring and training new employees, prison stays for those who switch to the black market to avoid mandate, and dealing with people who are radicalized as a result and start commit direct violence (not just bioviolence).  A lot of the troubles in Iraq were caused by the US the people trained in violence (military) that they no longer had a job, so they went and found a similar job opposing those who threw them into poverty without doing anything to help them.

Also, I read in the article that they had a control group that got infected with flu or the common cold and found a 50% difference. What does that mean? If 1% of people infected with influenza had lingering symptoms, then 1+0.5*1=1.5% of people with covid had lingering symptoms?

If the 30% number is real, with vaccines halving chance of long covid, that leaves us with 15% of people having lingering symptoms after a breakthrough case.
