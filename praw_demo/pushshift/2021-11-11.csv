Effectively, you only look for the wellbeing of the children when taking decisions about them.

This is the effective policy in countries such as UK, Norway, Portugal, etc... I suspect in the US it may not be the case, in which situation it is justified to vaccinate kids in order to reduce the overall transmission.

[],,Cagoss85,,,,,,,"Hey guys I need some opinions. 

I'm a senior college student at a rigorous STEM university. It's very much a ""fall behind and you're screwed"" atmosphere. We also have a very rigorous COVID testing program. I have to get tested twice a week, wear masks in all buildings, etc. Due to this, my schools covid numbers have been low (averaging about 2 cases per day) and we've been lucky enough to have a relatively normal school year, with only masks and no capacity limits. But, if you test positive for covid, we are required to isolate for 10 days and not allowed to come to classes or campus for any reason (zoom lectures). Thanksgiving is in the third to last week of my semester, with two major projects to finish and finals to prepare for happening right after it.  

My Aunt lives about an hour away from the family. Due to COVID last year, she was unable to come see us for Thanksgiving or Christmas, which sucked. Luckily, we were able to meet up over the Summer again.  

Moving forward to now, she is going on vacation to Aruba and getting home 2 days before Thanksgiving. God forbid she gets COVID on the trip, this is not enough time for symptoms to develop and get a covid test or realize she needs to isolate. This means she could pass it to not to my brother and I, but the entire family. My brother is in college as well and is in the same situation as me. When asked if I was comfortable seeing them, I honestly said no because my brother and I have too much to lose in regards to finishing up classes online.  

Due to this, my mother recommended that she not come home for Thanksgiving. Understandably, she is upset because it will keep our family apart during the Holidays for two straight years. But my brother and I stand firm on not wanting ANY chance of her bringing COVID back with her.

. Germany's testing numbers aren't as high as the US and UK. So it hasn't been as easy for them to identify cases, isolate and treat infected cases, and contact trace.

. UK has 90% of people with some form of immunity. US has 85%. Germany's is much lower.

. Germany's Delta wave happened much later then other nations, as the wave didn't start for them until August, and the most recent surge is more sudden and recent from their colder weather bringing them inside. With that said, their Rt spread rate has been going down slowly over the last 2-3 weeks.

. For record cases to happen again in the US, all regions would need to be up at once. The South already had its Delta Wave, the plains and the mountain states are starting to recede in their wave, and now it's time for the Great Lakes and the North to have their wave. 

. Gottlieb finishes by telling people not to panic.

Rugged individualism and caring about yourself doesn't mean you can't care about the environment. The two are not mutually exclusive.

From the US point of view, a statistic majority of us (almost 70% and growing) agree that climate change is a problem and that the government needs to do more to protect our environment and reduce the effects of climate change.

So what's the problem? There's only so much an individual can do. They can reduce, reuse, and recycle. They can petition their local leaders, but all of those things only have so much power when huge corporations with billions of dollars in their pocket lobby (read: bribe) in order to continue polluting, deforesting, and irresponsibly dumping their waste in the environment. 

Until government changes so that it truly responds to the will of the people and not the will of those with the deepest pockets you're not gonna see any meaningful change and that holds true regardless of whether a country is individualistic or not.

This is for basic immunsation:


&gt; Yes, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19 because:

&gt; * Research has not yet shown how long you are protected from getting COVID-19 again after you recover from COVID-19.
&gt; * Vaccination helps protect you even if you’ve already had COVID-19.

&gt; Evidence is emerging that people get better protection by being fully vaccinated compared with having had COVID-19. One study showed that unvaccinated people who already had COVID-19 are more than 2 times as likely than fully vaccinated people to get COVID-19 again.

&gt; If you were treated for COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure what treatments you received or if you have more questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine.

&gt; If you or your child has a history of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults or children (MIS-A or MIS-C), consider delaying vaccination until you or your child have recovered from being sick and for 90 days after the date of diagnosis of MIS-A or MIS-C. Learn more about the clinical considerations for people with a history of multisystem MIS-C or MIS-A.

&gt; Experts are still learning more about how long vaccines protect against COVID-19. CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html

German RKI recommends vaccination for the recovered 6 months after infection but it is possible 4 weeks after symptoms stopped:

&gt; The STIKO recommends a vaccine dose generally 6 months after infection for people with confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection *. In view of the increasingly better vaccine availability and the harmlessness of a vaccination after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, the administration of a vaccine dose is possible from 4 weeks after the end of the COVID-19 symptoms.

&gt; For people with confirmed asymptomatic SARS-Cov-2 infection for whom the time of infection is not known, the recommended single vaccination can be given as early as 4 weeks after the laboratory diagnosis. https://www.rki.de/SharedDocs/FAQ/COVID-Impfen/FAQ_Genesene_Impfdosis.html",,,,1636709113,{},hkbbk5y,False,t3_qrg9wk,False,True,t1_hka42d5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qrg9wk/daily_discussion_thread_november_11_2021/hkbbk5y/,1636995876.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_15ua46,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Let's calculate the implied VE against an immune-naive population for Moderna and see if it drops.

From 3/15/21 to 8/11/21 (closest dates I have data for to match the above study) infection only seroprevelance increase from 20% of the population to 22% of the population.  While at the same time, the the fully vaccinated 18+ population increased from \~15% to \~65%.

​ [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#nationwide-blood-donor-seroprevalence](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#nationwide-blood-donor-seroprevalence)

[https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/state-covid-19-data-and-policy-actions/](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/state-covid-19-data-and-policy-actions/)

&amp;#x200B;

We also assume that past infection provides 83% protection when compared to an immune naive population. ([https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n124](https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n124))

&amp;#x200B;

So in March the control group was unvaccinated people, of which 0.2 / (1 - 0.15) = 24% had past infections at the time.  We calculate the remaining risk for the control group (unvaccinated people  18+) was (1.0 - 0.24) \* 1.0 + 0.24 \* (1 - 0.83) = 0.8008.  The parent study said Moderna was 89% effective at the time meaning the remaining risk for those people was 0.8008  \* (1 - 0.89) = 0.088088.  If we wanted to convert this remaining risk to a VE when measured against an immune naive population we do: 1 -  0.088088 = 91% VE -- very similar to the RCT results.  Good.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we do a similar calculation in August for the control group, of which now 0.22 / (1.0 - .65) = 63% had past infections at the time.   We calculate the remaining risk for the control group (unvaccinated people  18+) was (1.0 - 0.63) \* 1.0 + 0.63 \* (1 - .83) = 0.4771.  The parent study said Moderna had dropped to 58% effective at the time meaning the remaining risk for those people was 0.4771  \* (1 - 0.58) = 0.200382.  If we wanted to convert this remaining risk to a VE when measured against an immune naive population we do: 1 -  0.200382 = 80% VE, an absolute drop of 10% and a doubling of remaining risk.

**So Moderna: 91% -&gt; 80%**

**A similar calculation for Pfizer shows a drop from 89% -&gt; 74%.**

**J&amp;J: 88% -&gt; 58%.**

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion: there’s likely a real drop in protection against a positive PCR test (most likely symptomatic covid.) offered from the shots.  Pfizer has announced ([https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-phase-3-trial-data-showing](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-phase-3-trial-data-showing)) boosters in a RCT are 96% effective against symptomatic illness compared to a fully vaccinated population.  Combining this figure with the math above would put boosted Pfizer at somewhere around 99% effective against symptomatic illness compared to an immune naive population.  (and 98% effective when compared to the unvaccinated population.)  That’s a 26x reduction in remaining risk compared to fully vaccinated 6 months out.  Similar ‘x’ to the 'x' increase boosters generate in antibody titers.

Anyhow, I find this data incredibly compelling to recommend a booster shot at 6 months.",,,,1636739062,{},hkcvnmn,False,t3_qn36d6,False,True,t1_hkcmd46,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qn36d6/study_shows_dramatic_decline_in_effectiveness_of/hkcvnmn/,1637028256.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_6lgoi,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;In *Los Angeles*, **dozens** of anti-vaxx protesters rallied outside of City Hall. 

&gt;In *New York City*, the anti-vaxx protesters came together in Times Square. A crowd estimated as **several hundred** in news reports carried signs and chanted, some carrying American flags.

&gt;European cities saw much larger turnouts. Crowds estimated at **more than 120,000** across various cities in *France* protested, part of an ongoing series that has now extended for more than two months.

&gt;*Madrid* saw an estimated **25,000 people** join an outdoor party at the Complutense University without safety precautions.

The US has not had anywhere near the number of people protesting vaccines as Europe has seen. Europe is winning that dubious distinction by a wide margin.

 and some studies I have read indicates that the viral load is much lower and ends more quickly with vaccinated people so the time frame in which you are potentially infectious is lower and also the viral load you are spreading is potentially less. From what I have read, studies indicate that viral load has a huge impact on whether someone actually gets the virus - which is why the science supports varying levels of caution even among vaccinated people - long exposure in a closed environment with lots of different people is high risk versus being in open spaces distanced or even being in a fairly large open enclosed space for a limited period of time - e.g. if you are shopping in a supermarket there is probably a smaller amount of viral aerosolized particles - not that one wouldn't be advised to wear a mask but just that it is lower risk than being packed in a restaurant with a lot of unmasked people for a long period of time.

You have to already be something of a hateful idiot in order to tolerate the stream of bullshit that floods out of your speakers whenever the morons on screen start moving their meatflaps...

It drills faith over fact into you day in and day out, and then instills fear of the unknown into their viewers who they've kept ignorant of aforementioned facts. Enormous pieces of reality - statistical data, recorded events, concrete fact - are straight up kept away from Fox viewers.

They ensure that their viewers never accidentally stumble across that information too by pounding it into viewer's heads that every other source of information - experts, other news stations, leaders outside their own party - are lying and evil. In doing this, the truth is entirely hidden from view and the only 'reality' is the one that Fox News fabricates for their viewers.

This is why 30+% of Republicans are so ready and determined to murder their neighbors in the name of their political party.

They do not understand the concept of rates. Texas has slightly fewer people dead from COVID than California does. But California has ten million more people than Texas. All they focus on is the number of deaths.

I saw a thread with thousands of upvotes that calculated the odds of dying from COVID using ""CDC"" numbers. The denominator was everyone in the *population*, not only people who had gotten COVID.

Not that they believe the death numbers are real.

What makes COVID deniers so crazy is that their conspiracy theory relies on hundreds of thousands of people all participating in a conspiracy.

It's the hundreds of thousands (or millions?) of health care workers in hospitals, nursing homes, and doctors offices all across the world who would have to be lying about seeing large volumes of COVID patients dying. 

It's the morgues and funeral homes that would have to be lying about being overwhelmed with COVID bodies.

Even administrative assistants and cleaning staff would have to be in on the lie.",,,,1636756258,{},hkdzv3h,False,t3_qslkee,False,False,t3_qslkee,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qslkee/covid_misinformation_spreads_because_so_many/hkdzv3h/,1637049737.0,210,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_h0u98,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We're already seeing that even with boosters and child vaccinations, there are enough susceptible people to set off the biggest waves ever in highly-vaccinated countries. In the long run I think it might save more lives worldwide if they were to accept these waves and go back to normal anyway, but then they would be accused of not caring about their own people.

There are (obviously) varying degrees of myocarditis. 

In cases of COVID that cause myocarditis you are likely dealing with more moderate to severe myocarditis where the heart is failing and unable to adequately mobilize fluid causing buildup, you would also experience fatigue, chest pain, and abnormal (or abnormally fast) heart beats. This would require aggressive treatment.

With cases of myocarditis from the vaccine you would experience more mild symptoms of fatigue, chest pain or faster heart beat but not nearly as much as the above case. Treatment here is often rest, and potential over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs.

It should also be noted that getting COVID is a much larger risk for myocarditis compared to the mRNA vaccinations and in [one study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2784800) of the 1,000,000+ men vaccinated 15 had confirmed cases of myocarditis. This is not to say the risk is negligible but relatively low.

[],,Worms_sg,,,,,,[],"SINGAPORE - Covid-19 patients who are unvaccinated by choice and end up in the intensive care unit (ICU) could be looking at a bill of around $25,000 before subsidies.

With subsidies, the amount payable is significantly lower, the Ministry of Health (MOH) told The Straits Times.

The $25,000 is the median acute hospital bill size for those who require both ICU care and Covid-19 therapeutics, the MOH said.

""Means-tested government subsidies and MediShield Life coverage can reduce the bill to about $2,000 to $4,000 for eligible Singaporeans in subsidised wards.""

Covid-19 patients can use their MediSave balance to help fund this remaining amount, said an MOH spokesman.

The authorities announced recently that from Dec 8, those who are unvaccinated will have to foot their own medical bill if they become ill with Covid-19.

These are the people who can get vaccinated but choose not to do so. They form a big group of the Covid-19 patients who end up in the ICU.

If these people are sent to a Covid-19 treatment facility, the bill there is expected to be around $4,500 for a seven-day stay, the MOH spokesman said.

""For Singapore citizens, after subsidies and MediShield Life where applicable, the co-payment is around $1,000.""

Depending on the severity of the patient's condition and the type of Covid-19 facility where care is rendered, the bill size would vary, said the spokesman.

There are also community isolation facilities (CIFs) here. Currently, travellers and short-term visit pass holders are charged for CIF stays.

&gt;The country had spent billions of dollars offering at least one free antigen test per resident each week since March, but then ended the policy last month in the hope that making people pay for tests would lead them to get vaccinated.

&gt;Now, German leaders are scrambling to act as case numbers spiral upward. On Thursday — after a week in which new case numbers had set records four times — health officials recorded 48,640 new infections, a slight drop from Wednesday’s number.

&gt;The health minister’s hourlong news conference appeared to be an attempt to show national leadership in what is increasingly seen as a countrywide crisis. Mr. Spahn even suggested that Covid tests could ultimately be required, even for vaccinated people, for entry to certain venues and events.

&gt;But not everyone seems concerned about the spike in numbers.

&gt;On Thursday, tens of thousands of revelers gathered in Cologne for the start of carnival season. Although the designated party spots were restricted to attendees able to prove that they had been vaccinated or had recovered from Covid, controls were lax and impromptu parties sprung up outside those zones.

&gt;A musician playing at the festivities warned partygoers not to kiss strangers this year, a reference to a custom of carnival celebrations.

&gt;”Maybe this year just snog your partner! Otherwise we won’t get through the season,” said the musician, Peter Brings. “And next year we can all make out with each other again.”

From the article, it sounds like the onus was near completely shifted to private companies like CVS to handle their own supplies; there appears to be ample amounts for 5-11, but Florida has completely checked out...we already know this, but it sucks to see repeatedly.

&gt;University of Florida epidemiologist Cindy Prins said Florida’s reliance on the private sector would serve most of the state’s population well but could still leave some behind.  
&gt;  
&gt;She noted that some low-income communities don’t have a grocery store chain or pharmacy chain nearby. Many families in those communities also rely on public transportation and may be uninsured or under-insured, meaning they don’t have a regular doctor where they could get their children vaccinated.

&gt;The stringent, if sometimes impractical, restrictions stem from China’s struggle to maintain its “zero Covid” strategy. Other nations have gradually loosened restrictions as they vaccinate more people, allow more gatherings with limits and bolster their health care systems for those who get sick. By contrast, the Chinese Communist Party has staked a big share of credibility on its ability to stamp out the disease entirely.

&gt;China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, said this week that the country had “overcome the impact of Covid-19.” In propaganda messaging from a major party meeting, Communist Party leaders touted the successes of their response in saving lives while playing down the huge social and economic cost of those measures.

&gt;Government officials have defended their approach, saying that it is “low cost” and has allowed the country to recover from the pandemic faster than others. So far, caseloads remain low. Officials have reported 1,280 in the current outbreak that began in mid-October.

&gt;But the limits have costs. In the case of new scrutiny on imports, scientists widely believe that they will do little to keep people from getting infected. Amid a fresh Covid-19 outbreak in the port city of Dalian, Chinese officials this week ordered businesses there that use imported frozen foods to stop their operations.

&gt;In a neighboring Hebei Province, officials tested hundreds of packages after several workers at a children’s clothing factory were found to have Covid-19. In Guangxi, a province 1,200 miles to the south of Hebei, officials went even further, testing every person who had touched or even received a package from the factory.

&gt;Not a single person outside the factory reported testing positive.

&gt;In addition to inspecting imported frozen foods, China has required that packages coming from overseas be sanitized, and has encouraged people to use masks and gloves when receiving deliveries. International health bodies have said there is a minimal chance of transmission on surfaces like cardboard.

&gt;Chinese officials have in the past suggested that imports could bring the disease into China. They have been under pressure from the international scientific community and world leaders to disclose more about the source of the outbreak, which was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan nearly two years ago.

&gt;Officials have also continued to enforce lockdowns to address occasional breakouts. Entire cities have been shut down at a moment’s notice. One city in the southwest has been locked down four times in the past year. About 30,000 visitors to Shanghai’s Disneyland had to stay and get tested this month before being allowed to leave.

&gt;In Beijing, the authorities closed dozens of pharmacies that had been caught selling cough medicine without requiring customers to register with their name and ID.

&gt;The strategy could face a significant challenge as China prepares to host athletes and visitors for the Winter Olympics, which will be held in Beijing in February.

&gt;Organizers have said the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games will take place in a bubble in which athletes, broadcasters and journalists will be required to stay. Already, two foreign Olympic athletes who are in the country for related events have tested positive for Covid-19, Reuters reported on Friday.",,,,1636723512,{},hkbviqb,True,t3_qsb3he,False,True,t3_qsb3he,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qsb3he/aiming_for_zero_covid_china_focuses_on_frozen/hkbviqb/,1637007556.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_3nelaphm,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What we had was the *hope* that vaccines would solve the crisis, but they don't. They protect the individual and somewhat reduce spread, but they are not effective enough to get R below 1, meaning it'll snowball regardless.

And we don't have a plan B. The upcoming covid pills will reduce mortality, but only if they are trivially cheap and plentiful so people actually take them at the onset of symptoms instead of waiting until it is too late, and they're $700 in the US, so that's not happening. Boosters would work if *everyone* takes them, which they won't. Nasal vaccines do prevent spread, but they need to be manufactured, distributed, and people need to be willing to take another vaccine. And all the while, the vaccine continues to wane and natural immunity disappears within a year.

I don't see what the endgame is. There seems to be nothing to prevent another lockdown next year, and the year after that, and so on until the end of days.

I need help clarifying this idea so it fits into a few sentences rather than being really long. If you have a better way of phrasing this, please let me know:

Most of our childhood vaccines are given with months or years between doses. Maybe these vaccines need that amount of time for peak and lasting effectiveness. Since we're in a pandemic, we are getting doses more often now than we would need if the virus weren't everywhere. In the future, when SARS-CoV-2 is rarer, it may be that we give kids only two doses, but a year or 18 months apart. We would be able to do this because the risk of someone being exposed to the virus during that time period would be pretty low. Additional doses won't hurt anything, but again, we just haven't had time to figure this out yet. The first large group of people to get these vaccines got them less than a year ago. Maybe we need four boosters and then we have lifetime immunity. Maybe we only need one.

People not only have rights but also duties. An ethical population has to take care of one another. The vaccines primary goal is to protect the vaccinated, albeit more rare vaccinated can carry the virus and infect mainly the unvaccinated.

You can literally see this in the meeting agenda and the materials that they solicited presentations from foreign public health agencies.

The vaccine committee used a combination of different data, including [real world data from Israel](https://www.fda.gov/media/152205/download), immunological assay data, safety data, etc. In addition, the Pfizer submitted study that they used to evaluate the Pfizer booster vaccine is being conducted internationally - see page 12 of the [briefing document](https://www.fda.gov/media/152176/download): ""The Phase 2/3 portion of the study is being conducted in the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, South Africa and Turkey.""

The FDA made its initial decision while the study was still ongoing, and the initial results/evidence was not particularly robust in September. The number of study participants for the booster studies was significantly smaller than the large n Phase 3 studies conducted for when the original EUA for the vaccines was granted in late 2020/early 2021.

Importance  Long-term effect of parental COVID-19 infection vs vaccination on human milk antibody composition and functional activity remains unclear.  
  
Objective  To compare temporal IgA and IgG response in human milk and microneutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 between lactating parents with infection and vaccinated lactating parents out to 90 days after infection or vaccination.  
  
Design, Setting, and Participants  Convenience sampling observational cohort (recruited July to December 2020) of lactating parents with infection with human milk samples collected at days 0 (within 14 days of diagnosis), 3, 7, 10, 28, and 90. The observational cohort included vaccinated lactating parents with human milk collected prevaccination, 18 days after the first dose, and 18 and 90 days after the second dose.  
  
Exposures  COVID-19 infection diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction within 14 days of consent or receipt of messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273).  
  
Main Outcomes and Measures  Human milk anti–SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain IgA and IgG and microneutralization activity against live SARS-CoV-2 virus.  
  
Results  Of 77 individuals, 47 (61.0%) were in the infection group (mean \[SD\] age, 29.9 \[4.4\] years), and 30 (39.0%) were in the vaccinated group (mean \[SD\] age, 33.0 \[3.4\] years; P = .002). The mean (SD) age of infants in the infection and vaccinated group were 3.1 (2.2) months and 7.5 (5.2) months, respectively (P &lt; .001). Infection was associated with a variable human milk IgA and IgG receptor-binding domain–specific antibody response over time that was classified into different temporal patterns: upward trend and level trend (33 of 45 participants \[73%\]) and low/no response (12 of 45 participants \[27%\]). Infection was associated with a robust and quick IgA response in human milk that was stable out to 90 days after diagnosis. Vaccination was associated with a more uniform IgG-dominant response with concentrations increasing after each vaccine dose and beginning to decline by 90 days after the second dose. Vaccination was associated with increased human milk IgA after the first dose only (mean \[SD\] increase, 31.5 \[32.6\] antibody units). Human milk collected after infection and vaccination exhibited microneutralization activity. Microneutralization activity increased throughout time in the vaccine group only (median \[IQR\], 2.2 \[0\] before vaccine vs 10 \[4.0\] after the first dose; P = .003) but was higher in the infection group (median \[IQR\], 20 \[67\] at day 28) vs the vaccination group after the first-dose human milk samples (P = .002). Both IgA and non-IgA (IgG-containing) fractions of human milk from both participants with infection and those who were vaccinated exhibited microneutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2.  
  
Conclusions and Relevance  In this cohort study of a convenience sample of lactating parents, the pattern of IgA and IgG antibodies in human milk differed between COVID-19 infection vs mRNA vaccination out to 90 days. While infection was associated with a highly variable IgA-dominant response and vaccination was associated with an IgG-dominant response, both were associated with having human milk that exhibited neutralization activity against live SARS-CoV-2 virus.",,,,1636733689,{},hkciapk,True,t3_qselzd,False,True,t3_qselzd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qselzd/association_of_human_milk_antibody_with_sarscov2/hkciapk/,1637020818.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Knowledge of the origin and reservoir of the coronavirus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is still fragmentary. To date, the closest relatives to SARS-CoV-2 have been detected in Rhinolophus bats sampled in the Yunnan province, China. Here we describe the identification of SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses in two Rhinolophus shameli bats sampled in Cambodia in 2010. Metagenomic sequencing identifies nearly identical viruses sharing 92.6% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2. Most genomic regions are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, with the exception of a region of the spike, which is not compatible with human ACE2-mediated entry. The discovery of these viruses in a bat species not found in China indicates that SARS-CoV-2 related viruses have a much wider geographic distribution than previously reported, and suggests that Southeast Asia represents a key area to consider for future surveillance for coronaviruses.",,,,1636733534,{},hkchwzo,True,t3_qsek0r,False,False,t3_qsek0r,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qsek0r/a_novel_sarscov2_related_coronavirus_in_bats_from/hkchwzo/,1637020607.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although significant attention has been directed towards ACE2, there are numerous coronavirus-associated receptors.20 ACE2 was rarely expressed in the brain tissues analyzed herein, whereas BSG was more widely expressed, and ANPEP showed preferential expression in vascular cell types, such as endothelial cells and pericytes. Even though Patient 1 had no detectable virus in OB or PFC at the time of autopsy, these results remain important as they provide evidence of infection potential in the brain via alternative receptors. In addition, these findings illustrate how expression heterogeneity in microanatomic compartments can underlie systemic, variable host-driven responses affecting uninfected tissues, as may be seen in the context of hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable syndromes.

I’m assuming it’s the recent Oct 22 article. 

That being said, some number of people do fall through the cracks or disappear into the population. Are they *driving* cases right now? I don’t think the numbers would support that, especially if we consider they are undocumented migrants and likely stay out of public view as much as possible. Some number may have recovered from COVID (not great for immunity but still some), and some may have gotten vaccinated already since it is free here and possibly in their home countries. I still believe the cases are being driven by our own 25-35% unvaccinated population, schools being open and masks not required in many, plus an overall relaxing of precautions by just about everyone.

Of course some people who self describe themselves as such can hold harmful views, but going against the grain can also lead to positive change. Also you're spot on about the Nestle company. What's more, a good portion of the plastics that they and some other companies put out there may not be recyclable at all, but they still promote it as our job to recycle in order to wash their hands of any responsibility to change. 

I think pharmaceutical companies are quickly falling into this same habit of pushing responsibility to the people while continuing to stuff their bank accounts. 

The COVID vaccine has become one of the most profitable products ever made. All of the vaccine producing companies have made billions of dollars while the vaccine itself is still out of reach in many poor countries. We could never really eliminate this virus while there are still pockets of communities around the world where it has the chance to transmit and mutate. 

In the US, I'm sure the hope that the vaccine would have a long efficacy window. Right now that seems to not be the case. Nevertheless, the message that is propagating here and indeed almost everywhere in the western world isn't that pharma companies will continue their efforts to innovate, it's just that citizens have a responsibility to our society to get *more* boosters.

[],,Dandan0005,,,,,,[],"&gt;&gt;still more than 10% of deaths in vaccinated individuals seems like a lot

That’s not how the math works. Check it out: 

If 45% of the population is vaccinated, if the vaccine offered no benefit, ALL ELSE BEING EQUAL (meaning, the risk factors exist in the same proportions for unvaccinated/vaccinated groups) then you would expect 45% of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths to be in vaccinated people. 

Instead, 88% of cases and 89% of deaths are in unvaccinated people, who only make up 55% of the population. Again, if we assume the risk factors for the two groups are the same (they aren’t, more on this later) then we can use this to estimate very rough estimate of protection from vaccines. 

Let’s say there are 10,000 people in a population, 5,500 unvaxxed vs 4,500 vaxxed. 

For easy math, let’s say 100 die with covid. 89% of these were unvaccinated. So, out of 5,500 unvaccinated people, 89 died of covid which equals = **1.6% of unvaccinated people died**

In the vaccinated population, only 11 out of 4,500 died with covid, which equals  = **~.2% of vaccinated people died**

This would imply that **the vaccine reduced your odds of dying from covid by 87.5%.**

But in reality, it’s even *more* than that. This whole time we’ve been assuming equal risk factors between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, but in reality, the vaccinated group is FAR older than sicker than the unvaccinated group. Which means you would expect them to die at a much higher rate than the unvaccinated group. 

To get the true efficacy of the vaccine, you have to compare vaccinated 65+ year olds to unvaccinated 65+ year olds, and vaccinated young people to unvaccinated young people. When you adjust for these risk factors, it’s consistently shown that the vaccines reduce your risk of death from covid by ~95%",,,,1636742612,{},hkd49wo,False,t3_qs1e1i,False,False,t1_hkaffmz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qs1e1i/unvaccinated_alabamians_make_up_majority_of_covid/hkd49wo/,1637033056.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_f1b57,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is it a problem for the hospitals?

Colorado is at that 50 per 100,000 and our hospitals are starting to hurt.

But that doesn't necessarily mean that Vermont will be hurting at a similar place.  Their population is more vaccinated which means that breakthroughs will comprise a higher percentage of cases which means lower hospitalization rates.  Additionally, different states likely pick up higher percentages of actual case numbers.  If Vermont is IDing 90% of cases while Colorado is only IDing 70%, that's going to give Vermont a higher threshold for where their hospitals hurt.

And why do I focus on hospitals?  Because that's the big one.

But that 3.6x figure is comparing vaccinated against both unvaccinated and partial.  So the ratio could be much higher, but because we don't know the prevalence of Covid between partial and no vaccine, we'd only be guessing.  But it must be much higher since as you showed, the numbers wouldn't make sense.

* Alabama population:  4,875,000 (100%)
* Fully Vaccinated:  2,203,000 (45.2%)
* Partially Vaccinated:  482,600 (9.9%)
* Unvaccinated:  2,189,400 (44.9%)

[],,Jujulabee,,,,,,[],"I get your frustration as I feel the same way as all any of us can do is to piece together what is written by sources that we find reliably credible and be prepared to change our behavior based on what seems to be happening.

For example, as soon as I read about the breakthroughs in the early Summer I really sensed that they were more than an aberration. Granted I don't spend time packed into P-Town clubs but I started following essentially the precautions I had before I was fully vaccinated.

From what I read the messaging on the boosters is as problematic as the early messaging on masking. Back then it was because there were no masks essentially and now it appears that there seems to be a split in terms of rich countries using vaccines that could go to completely unvaccinated people. Of course it really isn't that simple since the supply chain exists here in the US and from what I have read vaccines are literally going to waste. 

Also from a study I read it could be that three shots are necessary to perfect immunity. As I recall one of the hepatitis vaccines requires three shots for long term immunity. So much of the science is being determined in real time and that isn't the fault of the scientists.

All I can say in turns of why it is beneficial for others is that reputable source materials I have read indicates that it does prevent breakthrough which means a fewer people (vaccinated) are potentially infectious and causing community spread. And there is also some indicators that the viral load is small. Some articles I have read indicate that positive results might just indicate the vaccinated person was exposed to the virus and it is in the nose but the vaccine is doing what it should be doing by mobilizing to eradicate it. The analogy that I understood is that the vaccine is not a bug zapper which immediately kills any entering virus but rather it teaches the immune system so that it recognizes the intruder and more quickly mobilizes to neutralize it.

Abstract  
Background  
The COVID-19 pandemic affected universities and institutions and caused campus shutdowns with a transition to online teaching models. To detect infections that might spread on campus, we pursued research towards detecting SARS-CoV-2 in air samples inside student dorms.  
Methods  
We sampled air in two large dormitories for 3.5 months and a separate isolation suite containing a student who had tested positive for COVID-19. We developed novel techniques employing four methods to collect air samples: Filter Cassettes, Button Sampler, BioSampler, and AerosolSense sampler combined with direct qRT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 analysis.  
Results  
For the two large dorms with the normal student population, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in 11 samples. When compared with student nasal swab qRT-PCR testing, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in air samples when a PCR positive COVID-19 student was living on the same floor of the sampling location with a detection rate of 75%. For the isolation dorm, we had a 100% SARS-CoV-2 detection rate with Aerosol Sense sampler.  
Conclusion  
Our data suggest air sampling may be an important SARS-CoV-2 surveillance technique, especially for buildings with congregant living settings (dorms, correctional facilities, barracks). Future building designs and public health policies should consider implementation of HVAC surveillance.",,,,1636732952,{},hkcghyf,True,t3_qsebs8,False,False,t3_qsebs8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qsebs8/sarscov2_detection_in_air_samples_from_inside/hkcghyf/,1637019808.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vermont also has high testing rates, so they're catching more of the positive cases.

Because VT was so successful early on, most residents never caught COVID in the first place, so the state has less immunity overall (if we define immunity as vaccinated + previously infected).

Governor Phil Scott has been pretty quiet about this part, but a lot of infection is happening with 0-9 year olds who were unable to be vaccinated until very recently.

It's it because right now only ~1,200 people per day are dying of Covid-19?

I'm so glad the pandemic is pretty much over here, what with winter and the holidays coming. I mean could you imagine the spike we would see in the next three months if the pandemic wasn't pretty much over here?

I mean, on June 21 of this year we were averaging about 11,400 daily new cases, some six months after the first vaccine became available and 181M people in the US had been vaccinated. Sure, by September 1 we had spiked to 166k daily new cases even though we were up to 207M people vaccinated, but that was during July and August months absolutely notorious for the rampant spread of respiratory infections.

China will continue to hold cases at essentially zero for quite a while. At the moment, the societal costs of this policy are small compared to the costs the US, Europe and most other places around the world are paying by ""living with the virus.""

Part of the problem here is that the overall picture the NY Times paints is highly exaggerated. The overwhelming majority of people in China have not experienced a lockdown since early 2020. The virus is not present in most of the country, and where there are a few cases, the government tends to use contact tracing and mass testing before it resorts to lockdowns. Even when it does use lockdowns, they're usually highly targeted, covering only specific neighborhoods that have large numbers of cases.

The flip side of this is that in the vast majority of the country, people can go about their daily lives with very few restrictions, and without having to worry about getting infected.

With most of the world enduring wave after wave, there's no reason to give up the zero-CoVID policy now. Why would China let the virus spread, especially going into winter?

[],,dresdnhope,,,,,,,"&gt;I would highly recommend for everybody to get two Pfizer or Moderna shots, please — for the rest of us. Even if you believe the Earth is flat, it’s not. The former president… I knew the man before he ran for office. It was a crime for him to rip the mask off and take that stance and create that negative culture of distrust when he himself was vaccinated. The least he could do is say, “Hey, guys, I’ve been vaccinated because I don’t want to die. You may want to think about doing the same thing.” Nope, never talked about it. I think that’s highly unethical. So what do we do? The entire road crew must be vaccinated twice. Nobody gets backstage or onstage without wearing masks, and everybody stays at a safe distance and you’ve got to wash your hands and do everything else the CDC says. Don’t listen to politicians. They’re not qualified. Listen to scientists.

She could not sit, stand or speak. She could not feed herself or use the bathroom.

&gt;The occasional transfer from her bed to her motorized wheelchair required the arduous use of a Hoyer Lift; when settled into the chair, she could operate the joy stick with one hand or push a button with her head.

&gt;Once a robust 54-year old nurse’s aide, Markle was still plagued by erratic blood pressure, anxiety, depression and the metallic taste that many covid-19 patients complain of when they eat. She had an ever-growing bed sore that contributed to her eventual death from septic shock, after another 68 days of intensive care.

&gt;”A lot of people think after the ICU, if you make it, you come home and your life’s normal again,” said her daughter, Brittany Butler. “Because that’s what I thought. I thought, ‘Oh my God, we’re going to have her back home with us. We’re going to have the same life that we once had.’”

&gt;For perhaps hundreds of thousands of people, the coronavirus pandemic has proved it often does not work out that way. Intensive care has saved countless lives since January 2020, but the invasive process can also yield a poorly-recognized cluster of serious consequences that together constitute “post-intensive care syndrome.” They are symptoms not of the disease, but of the cure.

&gt;The worst effects include debilitating weakness and fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, difficulty thinking and hard-to-define challenges functioning in daily life. Family members, suddenly thrust into the role of caregivers for a seriously ill loved one, endure emotional and practical difficulties of their own.

&gt;Only in recent years have doctors and researchers begun to focus on the long-term impact of their efforts in the ICU to stave off death. Much remains unknown, but growing evidence points to prolonged inactivity, deep sedation, delirium and powerful medications as some of the main causes of serious side-effects that can last for years.

&gt;Some physicians are considering how they can alter their practices in the ICU to improve results for the people who survive. Earlier physical therapy, lighter sedation and screening for psychological problems are being tested or considered.

&gt;”Why is it we high-five when people leave the ICU and then never think about them again?,” asked Brad Butcher, head of UPMC’s medical ICU, who treated Markle and has opened one the nation’s few clinics for post-ICU syndrome.

Now 12.000 people are testing positive, while the amount of people in hospital is around 1500. Of course this is also a result of the vaccines causing less people to need hospitalisation.

But there are other things we can do (like masking) to help get through it with less suffering. How helpful is it? It’s hard to say.

On the other side is the vaccinated part of the population, 85% of the total, which makes up less than 50% of the cases and hospitalizations. There 5-6 times more vaccinated people than unvaccinated, yet the unvaccinated ones make up the majority of cases.

The math is simple. While the unvaccinated do not make up a huge majority of the positive and severe cases, the prevalence and likelihood of contacting covid (and especially a severe case) are significantly higher if unvaccinated. They definitely create a vast majority of the risk.

As far as 65-70% vaccination goes, that was the number for herd immunity pre-Delta. Delta changed everything. If you can't understand that circumstances change, and that things that ""they"" said months ago may not apply now, then I don't know what to tell you.

Yeah, it sucks that the vaccines aren't perfect. But they are still effective, especially the mRNA ones. Netherlands took a gamble on the domestic Janssen vaccine (J&amp;J) and it turned out to not be as effective 6 months down the line with an ultra-contagious variant circulating. So we adjust.

The US has been sitting at higher levels of infection this year after vaccinating 50%+ of the population. The UK ironically has been showing that vaccinated people are actually more likely to test positive for the virus than unvaccinated in most age groups, Pg 22 (check each of the reports over the last 8 weeks):

https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1032859/Vaccine_surveillance_report_-_week_45.pdf

There is actually very little hard evidence that transmission/infection in the delta variant is significantly controlled by vaccination beyond a couple of months.

Finally, here’s a nature article that summarizes it nicely:

“Unfortunately, the vaccine’s beneficial effect on Delta transmission waned to almost negligible levels over time. In people infected 2 weeks after receiving the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, both in the UK, the chance that an unvaccinated close contact would test positive was 57%, but 3 months later, that chance rose to 67%. The latter figure is on par with the likelihood that an unvaccinated person will spread the virus.”
