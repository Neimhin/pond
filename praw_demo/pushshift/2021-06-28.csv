No hospital had a bed empty and people had to arrange cylinders of oxygen from shady vendors. I could not get any medical treatment, at all. Even the tiniest symptom made me break down. Now, I'm hypervigilant regarding mine and other family members' health. I cannot stand the thought of anything happening to them, and pretty much lose the ability to function momentarily whenever they have any slight health issue. I lose my temper and break down much more frequently now.

Also, while I got the virus, none of my 4 other family members got it. 3 of them were vaccinated with both the shots of AZ, and we live in a small apartment. This is also when we were hearing of entire households getting infected at once.

Former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb talks about this quite a bit on his [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)

The efficacy is reduced, slightly, by the delta variant--it was never 100% but it was and still is high.  People with two doses of an mRNA vaccine can and should feel individually protected.

To be brief and specific: the vaccine was 94% effective in clinical trials against symptomatic disease. With delta, that number is 88%.  That means you are now roughly ten times less likely to get sick than you would be if you were unvaccinated.   That number used to be twenty times less likely.  That means that even with no variants, you'd still see many, many cases of vaccinated people getting sick with symptoms.

Next, people commonly parroted that all vaccines were ""100% effective against hospitalization and death.""  The trials were not powered towards discerning this information, so neither was ever actually true.  We know that the Pfizer vaccine is 96% effective against hospitalization for the delta variant, and even more effective against death.  This means that your *individual risk* has been reduced by a factor of 25.  If you had a 5% chance of hospitalization if infected previously, it is now 0.2%.  Again, your risk of death is even lower.  If it was 0.6% (the previous estimated IFR), it is now closer to 0.02%.  **This is in line with many other risks that we all accept every day.**.

Founded by Shu-Kun Lin as a chemical sample archive, it has established over 200 broad-scope journals. MDPI is the largest open access publisher in the world and the 5th largest publisher overall in terms of journal paper output. The number of published papers has been growing significantly in the last decade with year over year growth of over 50% in 2017, 2018 and 2019.
 
**[Wisdom_of_the_crowd](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)** 
 
 &gt;The wisdom of the crowd is the collective opinion of a group of individuals rather than that of a single expert. This process, while not new to the Information Age, has been pushed into the mainstream spotlight by social information sites such as Quora, Stack Exchange, Wikipedia, Yahoo! Answers, and other web resources that rely on collective human knowledge. An explanation for this phenomenon is that there is idiosyncratic noise associated with each individual judgment, and taking the average over a large number of responses will go some way toward canceling the effect of this noise.

[],,squid_whisperer,,,[],,,,text,t2_5ux4kdnz,False,False,[],"Here are my 2 cents:  
1: The lead author is a bit of a [crackpot](https://publikum.net/prof-harald-walach-und-sein-versuch-sich-als-impfexperte-zu-profilieren), who advocates for homeopathic remedies, mistletoe brews and [advocates for 'Kozyrev mirrors'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Walach) which supposedly can ""focus radiation coming from biological objects to generate psycho-physical sensations"". The lead author is a psychologist, the second author is a physicist who seems to publish mainly about keto diets and the third author is some rando about whom no information can be found. Along this train of thought, MPDI is a 'for profit' open access publisher and has been [accused](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDPI) of running predatory journals. Now none of this actually refutes the findings in the paper, but it's not a good sign.  
2: The paper cites adverse reactions from the Adverse Drug Reaction database. One things that strikes me is that the proportion of reactions reported by individuals (rather than medical professionals) is 45%. This is quite high compared to other drugs (eg 19% paracetamol, 18% ramipril (a blood pressure med) or 13% ivermectin). This casts some doubt on the reliability of such figures. Further, the authors choose to cite dutch figures for safety case reports, which are seven time higher than the European mean. At the same time the authors say they have no reason to follow one set of guidelines vs another. So I would prefer to believe the mean, since this is usually [statistically more sound](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd) for many estimates.  
3: Let's assume the worst case risk is correct (remembering the European mean is seven times lower). The risk (at 4 deaths / 100 000) is still so tiny in my opinion as to warrant not worrying about. For comparison, the annual risk of death in a road accident in the USA is 11 / 100 000.  
4: Some of this data is hard to extrapolate from. According to the dutch govt data, deaths are counted regardless of cause. EG you might die from food poisoning two weeks after being immunised and still be counted as a vaccine-related death. The fact that the same can be said for COVID deaths in the field trial does not paint a clearer picture.  
5: The field study was conducted from Dec2020 to Feb2021, during which time already 22% of the population was immunized and during which time Israel had gone through several hard lockdowns. Therefore I find the calculation of NNTV (number needed to vaccinate) naive and even misleading. After all, in a country strictly regulating social interactions and with a significant proportion of population immunized, one would expect a vaccination not to impact ones risk of dying from COVID19 very much.

If new variants tend to make individuals sicker, transmission in that second half of contagiousness is likely to drop (given that they'd mostly be staying home). Variants that are less severe will likely see more people out and about for their entire infectious period, giving them more time to spread to others.

&gt;Dobbs has repeatedly stressed that Mississippians have the choice of getting vaccinated or contracting COVID-19, and that in every scenario a vaccinated person is going to have a better outcome than if they had declined the shot.

&gt;The data collected on infections and deaths over the last few months has made this argument irrefutable. The Associated Press reported that nearly all COVID deaths in the U.S. are among the unvaccinated. Of the more than 18,000 COVID-19 deaths that occurred in May, only around 150, or 0.8% were from fully vaccinated people. 

&gt;Despite the wide availability of vaccines and the risks posed by variants, Mississippi continues to rank last in the nation in the share of its population that has been vaccinated. 

&gt;Only 32% of Mississippians have been fully vaccinated despite significant gains made in recent months in vaccinating the most vulnerable and making vaccine access more equitable. People are simply declining to get their shots, and this is keeping Mississippi in last place.

The combination of these observational data with our laboratory data suggests that the correlation between NAbTs and vaccine efficacy in recent models10 continues to perform well across different vaccine types and SARS-CoV-2 variants (appendix p 5). It further highlights that the lower starting NAbTs of AZD1222 recipients will now render vaccine efficacy more susceptible to any possible individual-level variation (eg, prior infection, age, immune status, antibody durability, comorbidities). Prevention of infection, however, appears to require substantially higher NAbTs than prevention of the most severe COVID-19 disease and death. Therefore, although reduced in-vitro neutralisation of VOCs predicts reduced AZD1222 vaccine efficacy against symptomatic infection with the same VOCs, close monitoring of the unfolding pandemic will reveal the extent to which the link with severe or fatal COVID-19 has been broken by all current vaccines.",,,1624924784,{},h3ds3jg,True,t3_o9wlnh,False,False,t3_o9wlnh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o9wlnh/azd1222induced_neutralising_antibody_activity/h3ds3jg/,1625183313,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

 &gt;The scientific method is an empirical method of acquiring knowledge that has characterized the development of science since at least the 17th century. It involves careful observation, applying rigorous skepticism about what is observed, given that cognitive assumptions can distort how one interprets the observation. It involves formulating hypotheses, via induction, based on such observations; experimental and measurement-based testing of deductions drawn from the hypotheses; and refinement (or elimination) of the hypotheses based on the experimental findings.

First, they only looked at brain scans of people who happened to have a brain scan for some reason some time before they caught covid. Then they caught covid, and for this study they were then invited to do another brain scan so they could compare those two scans. So this allows a ""pre-covid/post-covid"" comparison which was not possible in previous ""post-hoc"" studies that only looked at brains after the infection without having any clue what these brains looked like before the infection.

Second, for every participant who had covid, they tried to find someone who took a first brain scan at a similar time as that participant and who is about the same age (+/- 6 months) and who didn't catch covid. They then invited that person to take part in the study as a participant in the control group. So they are able to compare how the brains of people who caught covid in that timespan have changed, and how brains of people who didn't catch covid have changed.

The results are not good. They found a loss of gray matter in those who caught covid compared to those who did not catch covid. Apparently all over the brain, but more significant in some parts of the brain compared to other parts of the brain. This could explain things like ""brain fog"" in long covid patients I guess.

And it also matches symptoms, since the loss of gray matter was more significant in areas that we need for smelling / tasting things.

They found more severe changes in hospitalized patients, but that finding was not significant (it could be random).",,,1624959664,{},h3f7y03,False,t3_oa1adj,False,False,t1_h3f6hdo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oa1adj/covid_linked_to_loss_of_brain_tissue_but/h3f7y03/,1625210168,27,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In this retrospective cohort study, we compared outcomes of patients infected with B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2 with those with wild-type strains from early 2020.

Methods: National surveillance data from 1-January-2021 to 22-May-2021 were obtained from the Ministry of Health, and outcomes in relation to VOC were explored. Detailed patient level data from all SARS-CoV-2 patients with VOC infection admitted to our centre between 20-December-2020 and 12-May-2021 were analysed. Outcomes were compared with a cohort of 846 patients admitted January-April 2020.

Findings: There were 838 VOC infections in Singapore in the study period. After adjusting for age and gender, B.1.617.2 infection was associated with higher odds of oxygen requirement, ICU admission, or death (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4¬∑90, [95% CI 1¬∑43-30¬∑78]. 157 patients with VOCs were admitted to our centre. After adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, and vaccination, aOR for pneumonia with B.1.617.2 was 1¬∑88 [95% CI 0¬∑95-3¬∑76]) compared with wild-type. B.1.617.2 was associated with significantly lower PCR Ct values and significantly longer duration of Ct value ‚â§30 (estimated median duration 18 days for B.1.617.2, 13 days for wild-type). Vaccine breakthrough cases were less severe.

Interpretation: There was a signal toward increased severity associated with B.1.617.2. The association of B.1.617.2 with lower Ct value and longer viral shedding provides a potential mechanism for increased transmissibility. These findings provide a strong impetus for the rapid implementation of vaccination programmes.",,,1624966218,{},h3ffhct,True,t3_oa6dwb,False,True,t3_oa6dwb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oa6dwb/clinical_and_virological_features_of_sarscov2/h3ffhct/,1625213912,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I‚Äôve also never had more than a sore arm from any vaccine (MMR, hepatitis, tetanus, flu, etc.). On the day I took my first Pfizer shot, I experienced menstrual spotting on and off for two weeks before my period would normally begin. I saw my GYN. She noted that there was inflammation but that we would need to track my cycle for a few months to see if there was a pattern because disruption could be caused by a lot of things. The bacteria test came back negative, so I tracked for a few months. It straightened itself out. 

Either the trial didn‚Äôt include a lot of women who menstruate or it‚Äôs very rare. Whatever the case, it appears to be harmless even though it was frightening because it was completely unexpected (no one likes to think about cancer). 

Last month I saw an article in The Guardian about this. It is absolutely a real phenomenon that needs to be understood better. Evidently inflammation is a natural part of the menstrual cycle, so the vaccine seems to trigger that process in some people. Young men are experiencing heart inflammation so it seems the vaccine simply triggers usual inflammation in some people. 

Whether or not this does any long lasting damage has yet to be seen, frankly. I‚Äôm still going to vaccinate, but I think people should be honest about these vaccines. There is a lot we don‚Äôt know, that we are finding out only at scale.

From January to April of this year, there were 10,262 infections amongst fully vaccinated individuals. 995 of these people were hospitalized. 160 died. And that is, by the CDC's own admission, probably a big undercount. Meaning the real number is likely way larger. [Source](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7021e3.htm)

Also, due to the fact that they are an island in the South Pacific, the only points of entry are by ship or plane.  They also have a cohesive government unlike the United States which due to the way the U.S government is structured, left Covid policies up to the individual states.  
Since the governors of each state had wildly different policies and no way to close state borders, this created issues with spread (initially and now).  The lack of ability to enforce a cohesive national policy means that the U.S. response cannot be compared to New Zealand's response to Covid.  The thousands of miles of unguarded borders the U.S has both to the north and south were problematic as well.
Also, to give an example of part of the problem, my state didn't even have a cohesive statewide policy.  Instead it differed from county to county.  This was problematic because there are a lot of people in my county that travel for work.

[This paper, titled ‚ÄúAnti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Persist for up to 13 Months and Reduce Risk of Reinfection‚Äù](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.07.21256823v3) found about 97% protection from being seropositive:

&gt; Overall, 69 SARS-CoV-2 infections developed in the COVID-19 negative group (incidence of 12.22 per 100 person-years) versus one in the COVID-19 positive group (incidence of 0.40 per 100 person-years), indicating a relative reduction in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection of 96.7%

[This one, titled ‚ÄúSARS-CoV-2 infection rates of antibody-positive compared with antibody-negative health-care workers in England: a large, multicentre, prospective cohort study (SIREN)‚Äù](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21\)00675-9/fulltext) found about 84% protection, but described this as a minimum, due to multiple caveats that lowered the effect:

1. All but two ‚Äúreinfections‚Äù were classified as ‚Äúpossible‚Äù, the remaining two as ‚Äúprobable‚Äù, none as ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù. The 84% estimate is based on using all ‚Äúpossible‚Äù reinfections.
2. Only about one third of ‚Äúreinfections‚Äù had typical COVID symptoms
3. The authors did not include baseline seronegative people who converted to seropositive as COVID-19 cases
4. The authors found a pattern they indicated seemed consistent with RNA shedding, over counting ‚Äúreinfections‚Äù
The authors note these issues in their paper:

&gt; **Restricting reinfections to probable reinfections only, we estimated that between June and November 2020, participants in the positive cohort had 99% lower odds of probable reinfection, adjusted OR (aOR) 0.01 (95% CI 0.00-0.03). Restricting reinfections to those who were symptomatic we estimated participants in the positive cohort had 95% lower odds of reinfection**, aOR 0.08 (95% CI 0.05-0.13). Using our most sensitive definition of reinfections, including all those who were possible or probable the adjusted odds ratio was 0.17 (95% CI 0.13-0.24).

&gt; A prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an 83% lower risk of infection, with median protective effect observed five months following primary infection. **This is the minimum likely effect as seroconversions were not included.**

&gt; **There were 864 seroconversions in participants without a positive PCR test; these were not included as primary infections in this interim analysis.**

&gt; **We believe this is the minimum probable effect** because the curve in the positive cohort was gradual throughout, indicating some of these potential reinfections were probably residual RNA detection at low population prevalence rather than true reinfections.

And of course, there is the recent [Cleveland Clinic preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176v2) which found a 100% protective effect.

There‚Äôs the study on the [marines](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(21)00158-2/fulltext), which found a protective effect of about 82%. After adjusting for race, age and sex, the HR was 0.16 or a protective effect of 84%. The authors note that 84% of ‚Äúreinfections‚Äù were asymptomatic, compared to 68% of primary infections. However, the authors believe they may undercount reinfections:

&gt; Our investigation is likely to underestimate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in previously infected individuals because the seronegative group included an unknown number of previously infected participants who did not have significant IgG titres in their baseline serum sample.

However, they note that the conditions the marines were in for the study may limit it‚Äôs generalizability: 

&gt; The high rate of infection at MCRDPI can be attributed to the crowded living conditions, demanding regimen, and requirement for personal contact during basic training despite the pandemic leads, which is known to contribute to an increased risk for respiratory epidemics.28 The close quarters and constant contact among recruits that are needed for team building allow a viral infection to rapidly proliferate within a unit. The physically and mentally demanding training environment might also suppress immunity. These factors are not typically present in the civilian community. Therefore, the study setting limits the generalisability of our findings to other settings where the frequency and intensity of exposure and the susceptibility of the host might differ.

Lastly, I am aware of [this research](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2776810) which conveniently took index positives and then plotted the likelihood of a PCR positive by days since index. At 0 to 30 days, the ratio was 2.85. From 31 to 60 days, it was 0.74, dropping to 0.29 at 61 to 90 days, and finally to 0.10 at more than 90 days.

They conclude:

&gt; In this cohort study, patients with positive antibody test results were initially more likely to have positive NAAT results, consistent with prolonged RNA shedding, but became markedly less likely to have positive NAAT results over time, suggesting that seropositivity is associated with protection from infection. The duration of protection is unknown, and protection may wane over time.",,,1624935976,{},h3edh3b,False,t3_o9hpmq,False,False,t1_h3c7fnd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o9hpmq/a_study_finds_that_the_pfizer_and_moderna/h3edh3b/,1625194612,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

1) A majority of British (61.9%) and American (57.0%) adults are fully vaccinated using vaccines that are highly effective even with respect to the Delta variant. Pfizer's efficacy against hospitalisation and death is estimated at 96% and AstraZeneca's at 92%. These adults pose a negligible public health risk, with breakthrough rates estimated at 0.01%-0.05%.

2) American and British citizens face considerable obstacles - particularly with regards to testing and quarantine requirements - for even essential travel between the two countries irrespective of vaccination status. This leads to a waste of testing resources and can be logistically and financially problematic.

3) LHR-JFK and LHR-LAX are two of the busiest and most important international air routes, carrying more than 4.7 million people annually. Travel between the US and UK is a multi-billion-dollar industry that supports an incredibly high number of livelihoods and is a significant economic sector that represents an important revenue source for both countries as well as many cities (London, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Miami, in particular) in both countries that have been particularly hurt by the pandemic and the shutdown in international travel. Financial resources to continue supporting individuals and businesses affected by a loss of this travel are thinning.

4) Delta is already in the US and rapidly growing. It will be the dominant strain in due course irrespective of opening the air corridor to people who don't pose as much of a risk anyway.",,,1624935530,{},h3ecmvh,True,t3_o9xee3,False,False,t1_h3e7s9h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o9xee3/usuk_travel_corridor_talks_increasingly_unlikely/h3ecmvh/,1625194173,25,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I have been long wondering what the situation will be once everyone who wants it is fully vaccinated.   Will public and private businesses be able to make vaccination a condition of employment?  In healthcare at the very least, it seems like this is a no brainer, but I expect lots of lawsuits and human rights complaints.

I feel like businesses should at the very least be able to make rules for staff and patrons based on vaccination status, such as making masks mandatory for people unwilling or unable to show proof of vaccination.  Having verifiable, globally recognized vaccination proof will be another challenge.

Our business was closed or shutdown for 0 days. And I know it's not gonna ever be 100% effective. I don't think the MMR vaccine I got in like 7th grade was 100% effective and I don't worry about that the same way I do as COVID because most of society falls in line when it comes to that MMR shot. These days with COVID, not so much. All this information we have at our fingertips has really gone a long way in educating experts who know that vaccines are DaNgErOuS or whatever.

So just the fact that more people are walking around with COVID and also now practicing no extra personal hygiene (as if they were before COVID) tells me that the spread now is probably more uncontrolled than it was during the height of the pandemic. The difference now being that more people are A) vaccinated and B) temporarily immune because they already had COVID. But since I feel that when most health restrictions were lifted that everyone who was begrudgingly following health orders threw it all out the window and went back to their old ways, I don't think it's out of the question to believe I should keep my defenses up. I mean these are the same people refusing vaccination.

Yes, those breakthrough cases are in the single digit % and of those the number who get hospitalized is even lower. I just don't want to be one of them. I don't think that means we need restrictions anymore but I think we should definitely continue on not worry about whether or not someone chooses to wear a mask. We've shown that we can function as a society even if everyone is walking around wearing masks so I'm not sure what the problem is when someone continues to wear one.

As a side note, since nothing fucking changed and we're still a disgusting people as a whole (worldwide), we're still gonna have people showing up to work sick.

How do you see the situation we are in where the government is pushing vaccination for people who are already seropositive and/or children who are at lowest risk of covid disease? No drug is 100% safe including the vaccines, there is always a risk/benefit analysis to consider and factors like above (already immune, young children etc)

Unfortunately it feels everything/one has become politicised and turned into us vs them mentality. People seem very willing to throw individuals into a box with limited information. Labels like conspiracy theorist and antivaxer are being thrown about without even bothering to consider the other.

Some people are not educated in all of this, they don‚Äôt know about research and mRNA and immunity - they may see and hear some statement and have no way to know the veracity of it. They may be scared for their childrens health. Throwing them into a box is doing more harm than good. 

It seems like a lot of people just trust what they hear from their group and if they see someone go against it, they are happy to chastise them, even though they know very little about the actual details. Dogmatism is not good. Open dialogue is what people need to engage in - open means you are genuinely curious about the other‚Äôs thoughts - I don‚Äôt see any of that in the current situation, it‚Äôs sad as fuck.

I believe the vaccines work and are safe, but there are different vaccines, different types, different bodies, different brains‚Ä¶ there are some things we CANNOT know, like long term issues. To say you know is wrong.

People have decided what they think, their group says so, then when they encounter a possible difference of opinion, they google quotes and articles from their group to support their opinion - I‚Äôm glad you realise that that‚Äôs not evidence and are not relying on that mode of thinking.

Like global warming, people will go crazy about it but have very limited knowledge on the actual details. Myself included, but I don‚Äôt pretend like I know shit about it, I say ‚Äúwell I read there‚Äôs a strong consensus and I generally trust scientists so it‚Äôs probably right but I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôd have to go and look at the evidence and if I can‚Äôt understand the evidence properly (like statistical significance, measuring protocols, proxies, jargon etc) then I‚Äôll have to try and acquire that knowledge. But until that point, I should accept that I don‚Äôt know shit. People seem to be going in the opposite of this, everyone has their opinions and they are willing to fight over them.

Wearing masks is hard. That feeling of breathing hot air on yourself (the country I'm in is between 90-100F most of the time) and feeling trapped inside it. The one thing that has helped get me through that is to remember to just take it slow. As most Americans, especially those living in big cities, I'm used to rushing around for everything. The more I rush while wearing a mask, the more I breathe hot air on myself and hate it more.

So if you can, slow down. Walk slowly (preferably in the shade or an air conditioned building). Relax as best you can. Take a cold water bottle with you and take sips frequently.

I don't agree that OP's ""roll the dice"" is silly, but you're right to extrapolate it and consider the cost of protective measures.

I wear a seatbelt every single time I drive, despite never having been in a serious accident.  Wearing a mask is a similar level of inconvenience to me -- nearly zero.  It'd be silly to argue against it when it's saving lives and hospitalizations at effectively zero cost to the wearer.

The cost of never driving is significant in my area.  I can wear a seatbelt and dramatically reduce that risk of death.  I also avoid drinking and driving, even though it's yet another mild inconvenience.

It's not just the size of the dice, it's also how many times you're going to roll it.  If you drive 4 times a day, multiply that out.  If you're potentially exposed to Delta 4 times a day, multiply it out.

&gt;‚ÄúI believe that viruses tend to become less pathogenic,‚Äù says Burtram Fielding, a coronavirologist at the University of the Western Cape, South Africa. ‚ÄúThe ultimate aim of a pathogen is to reproduce, to make more of itself. Any pathogen that kills the host too fast will not give itself enough time to reproduce.‚Äù If SARS-CoV-2 can spread faster and further by killing or severely harming fewer of the people it infects, we might expect that over time, it will become less harmful ‚Äî or, as virologists term it, less virulent.

This is extremely evident in our current flu strains that at one time were more lethal than they are today. We didn't get healthier or sanitize more it just evolved to be able to exist more thoroughly in our society.

If you dont loosen guidelines once people are starting to become protected, people and businesses will stop altogether on their own, you can't get away with airing on the side of caution in case a new variant arises. Once it did, it can change the landscape. It just might. You also can't hide the reality that vaccines may be short term and recurring, at least until you have data to say otherwise. The public is pretty well conditioned to that possibility by now.

I don't really know what institutional freakouts youre preparing for. Things closed hard when a pandemic was killing people rapidly and tens of thousands were gstting infected daily, as it by all means should have, and once the vaccine rollout started, theyve been loosening dramatically, at a rate faster then pretty much anybody expected. We arent at any sort of herd immunity and children are unvaccinated and its basically down to 'dont wear a mask, we trust you'.  It feels like theyve been pretty loose and chill overall. The daily cases are something like 20x lower than its peak, and the only real reason the 'institutions' would freak out is if that number starts to grow dramatically (or in a way that indicates early exponentual growth anyways), or hospitals begin to fill, or deaths skyrocket because of the variant beating vaccines or being *that* contiguous. If that happens, then hell yeah, put your mask back on and get over it. If it doesn't, there really isnt much of a reason to think theyd overreact. The response thus far, with the benefit of hindsight, has been pretty appropriate. There have been plenty of pandemic threats in the past and the only one weve had this dramatic response for in recent history was the one that correctly required it.

I'm answering this as if you are in the USA or a similar 1st world nation. 

You aren't accurate about the polio vaccine. You may know there are 2 kinds: an oral and injectable. The oral is superior but the injectable is safer. The USA switched to injectable around 2000 because the risk of encountering wild polio in the USA is now low because of decades of dedicated vaccination.  Children get 3 shots (or up to 5 if in combination with other vaccines.) If you are traveling outside the USA, you may - indeed - need a booster. In fact, all USA military service members who had polio vaccine as a child, get boosters. 

So, your fundamental understanding of vaccines isn't taking into account how many require boosters. 

Our bodies have different responses to different diseases and also to the vaccines for those diseases. 

For example, if we have the mumps or measles or the vaccines for those things, our bodies generate a big response. It is estimated, that we'd still have half our antibodies after 200 yrs; therefore, we have lifelong immunity. 

With chickenpox, on the other hand, we have lost half our antibodies in about 50 years. Since the human lifespan is only a few decades longer, the half we have left can still carry us through. (If we routinely start living a bit longer, it's plausible we might need a booster.) 

Then there's tetanus. We've lost half our antibodies to that in just 11 years. That's why, tetanus boosters are recommended every 10 years. 

As you noted, some diseases can change their genomes rapidly. That is the case with flu and colds and some other viruses. So, the flu shot is a vaccine, you just have to get another one as the virus itself changes. 

Also, for some reason, our bodies have sort of a blind spot when it comes to upper-respiratory infections and doesn't tend to see them as threats. Sometimes, the antibody response is very weak. 

This may be why some people seem to catch the coronavirus more than once. Their first infection may have been mainly limited to upper respiratory, and their body just didn't make many antibodies. 

Studies have determined a protective vaccine schedule for each vaccine to protect us while we are in the midst of this pandemic. For example, 2 for Pfizer/Moderna, 1 for J&amp;J. We may need a booster or we may not. 

Covid 19 is both more contagious and more deadly than polio. (Far. More. Deadly.) People in the USA are at much greater risk of contracting Covid 19 than polio. Yet, almost no one turns down a polio vaccine, even though a whole series is required and a booster is needed when traveling to a place where there is risk of exposure.

The vaccines have been in the market for ~6 months. Therefore, the only period of time for which relevant conclusions can be made is 6 months.

You can provide the advice of qualified experts, by linking to articles / research papers / CDC guidance, etc.

Speculation includes:

1. Lower starting efficacy.
2. The one dose schedule generally being weaker at stimulating immune response,

Put it this way, the smallpox virus is still quite deadly (kill rate of about 30%) and it's been recorded since Antiquity. Despite that lethality, it just hasn't had enough selective pressure to evolve into something less lethal, and clearly humans aren't going to let an outbreak of it run wild nowadays and stay endemic until it'll become less deadly. That could take millennia, if it'd ever happen.

Another object lesson is in [SIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian_immunodeficiency_virus), the likely ancestor of HIV. SIV was originally deadly for certain primates and ruined their immune systems just as HIV does in humans. However after a couple dozen millennia of natural infection (and dying from it), most primates have evolved so that they now have no problem with the virus and can quite happily function even with a quite high viral load of the stuff.

It might take a few dozen millennia of endemic and widespread infection by HIV in humans before something similar might happen.

These measures are not perfect but the border control has been especially strict with the format of the necessary documents, even with Japanese nationals.

I was going to my local post office the other day on the coast of the North Atlantic ocean.  Wearing a mask because the sign says to do so (until 2 days from now, at which point I'll use my own judgement).  


I approach the glass door and there's an elderly man inside, so I back up and motion for him to come outside, he motions again at the door, I notice his hands are full so I open and hold the door for him.  He started screaming bloody fucking murder about me being in his 6 feet, vaccinations are by age mostly where I live so if I'm vaccinated he is too, not to mention we're both wearing masks.    


He gets in my face screaming about corona and 6ft which is fair, but I was literally just trying to hold a door open outside for an old man in a very strong wind.    


For reference I'm 6'2 and 30 ish 220lbs and fit, he is 5'5, 80 ish and 120lbs in his prime.  

The problem is I'm still holding the door against a 70 km/h wind and if I let it go it's gonna knock him off his feet.  Meanwhile this guy is 6 inches from my face screaming at me about social distancing, then he threatens to fight me even though he's triyng to hold his mail with both hands. Even though I was just trying to hold the door open in the wind for an elderly man.  


After everyone started watching us I had to raise my voice to tell him to either get the fuck out of my way or hold the door himself (even for myself the wind was getting heavy)  He eventually went to his car, luckily I only needed to check my PO box and not actually talk to anyone because I was super embarrassed.  When I came out from the post office he was parked behind my jeep writing my plate down on paper.  I just drove across a lawn and around him/  


There is no point to this story, other than be kind to each other.   The pandemic has had an effect on everyone's mental health, an 80 year old man would never fight somebody over holding a door 2 years ago, neither would I have considered socking him in the mouth for being a dick.  We'll soon be back to normal and it's gonna take time for people to relax again.

&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;\- The Lambda variant was first originally discovered in Peru and the WHO has classified it as a 'Variant of Interest'  
&gt;  
&gt;\- As per the WHO, the Lambda variant is related to 81% of the cases detected since April in Peru  
&gt;  
&gt;The Covid-19 and its different variants have continued to wreak havoc across the globe. After B.1.1.7 (Alpha); B.1.351 (Beta); P.1 (Gamma); B.1.427 and B.1.429 (Epsilon); B.1.617.2 (Delta); and Delta Plus variant, another new variant has been discovered in the world, called Lambda variant.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last week, the UK health department added Lambda variant (C.37) to its list of 'variants under investigation' (VUI) due to international expansion. Six cases of Lambda have been identified across the UK to date, all have been linked to overseas travel.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Lambda variant was first originally discovered in Peru and the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified it as a ""Variant of Interest"" on June 14.  
&gt;  
&gt;The WHO said Lambda variant has multiple mutations in the spike protein that could have an impact on its transmissibility but more studies are needed to fully understand the mutations.  
&gt;  
&gt;Here's all you need to know about the Lambda variant:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- The Lambda variant or C.37 variant has already been reported as highly prevalent in Peru.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- The Lambda variant lies within the B.1.1.1 lineage.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- As per the WHO, the Lambda variant is related to 81% of the cases detected since April in Peru.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- The Lambda variant has been identified in as many as 29 countries, including North and South Am, Europe, and Oceania.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lambda in India:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- So far, India has detected Delta and Delta Plus variants in India. However, experts believe that the opening of international air travel might bring a cocktail of new variants, including Lambda in India.",,,1624955041,{},h3f3939,False,t3_oa2gcp,False,False,t1_h3ey48h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oa2gcp/lambda_variant_scientists_detect_new_covid/h3f3939/,1625207813,16,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You have also left out the part of that paper where they mention that some parts of the brain in COVID victims were statistically significantly smaller before even getting a diagnosis, raising a question about what part of the effect is causative versus just correlative.

Lastly, gray matter loss has been known to occur from smoking, sleep apnea, and other things - and typically recovers within a matter of months.

Why would a coronavirus with a spike protein that is so effective at binding to human ACE2 receptors be circulating in a population of creatures for which it shows no such affinity?

&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01407-1



That's not what your cited article is saying. 

From the article: 
&gt;However, our study revealed that many bat species (n = 32 and n = 28 of 46 species) do not support efficient binding with SARS-CoV-RBD and SARS-CoV-2-RBD, respectively (Fig. 2c,d). 

Just because many bat species don't bind well, it doesn't mean that all bat species don't bind well. The data says that 14/46 bat species do efficiently bind with SARS-COV1 ACE2 RBD and 18/46 bat species do efficiently bind with SARS-COV-2 ACE2 RBD.

They also found that 2 bat ACE2 supported infection similar to what's seen in human infections:

&gt;Furthermore, we conducted SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry assays on the two bat cell lines transiently transfected with various bat ACE2 (Bat2, 3, 31, 32, 33, 34, 38, 40) and their mutants (mutant Bat33, 34, 38 and 40m). The results were consistent with those derived from human cells, further confirming that ACE2 is the main receptor for the species-specific entry of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in these bat cells (Extended Data Fig. 7f,g).",,,1624988248,{},h3go3ij,False,t3_o98auz,False,True,t1_h3dqkco,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o98auz/the_lastand_onlyforeign_scientist_in_the_wuhan/h3go3ij/,1625237761,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The train takes a long time to stop and the receive  word that there *might be* a problem with a bridge up ahead and they have three choices:  1) keep the throttle down, since they do not know there will be a problem, 2) jam on the brakes, since maybe the bridge is down, or 3) let off the throttle so they can get more information.

It is sort of the same with COVID, since you have to wait for the variant to really break out before you can get data, and even then you have to wait five or six weeks until the data gets good, since it takes time for adverse events to be caught and measured.  Here is a June 11 report covering England and the delta variant:  [https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/993879/Variants\_of\_Concern\_VOC\_Technical\_Briefing\_15.pdf](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/993879/Variants_of_Concern_VOC_Technical_Briefing_15.pdf)

On page 13, it notes that they've identified 33,000 delta cases, but 28,000 are less than four weeks old, the point where people are most likely to die.  As a result, we don't really know what the deal is about the risk from Delta.  Some signs are encouraging, others not so.

For example, on a pure numbers basis, on page 13 again, it appears that Delta patients are much less likely to be hospitalized or die.  But again the data is super young, so it is hard to tell if this is just an artifact of the data set.

Indeed, if you look on page 50, once they controlled for ""age, sex,  
ethnicity, area of residence, index of multiple deprivation, week of specimen date,  
vaccination status and international travel within 14 days prior to specimen date"", Delta was substantially more severe, although they do not provide any sensitivity analysis to explain which of these controls are driving the difference.

Also troubling is that, purely on a raw number basis, the number of double dosed vaccinated deaths with Delta spiked over single dosed deaths.  But nothing that you can draw too much of a conclusion about, since the relative numbers are tiny (only 42 deaths out of 33,000, 7 in the single dosers, and 12 in the double dosers), and we have so little experience with the variant.  (Page 15).

However, this is all consistent with the nightmare hypothesis that, for example, while vaccines help prevent delta (80% after 2nd dose, page 51), if the vaccines do not stop delta it is then much more deadly.  Or not, it is simply too early to make any sound conclusions.

So don't slam the breaks, but do ease off the throttle to give us time to get more data and assess the risk.",,,1624987972,{},h3gnfww,False,t3_o9yf1g,False,True,t1_h3ejcc4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o9yf1g/la_county_urges_everyone_to_wear_mask_indoors_as/h3gnfww/,1625237395,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The dynamics of antibody secreting plasmablasts (PBs) and germinal centre (GC) B cells induced by these vaccines in humans remain unclear. We examined antigen-specific B cell responses in peripheral blood (n=41) and draining lymph nodes (LNs) in 14 individuals who received two doses of BNT162b2, an mRNA-based vaccine encoding full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) gene. Circulating IgG- and IgA-secreting PBs targeting the S protein peaked one week after the second immunization then declined, becoming undetectable three weeks later. These PB responses preceded maximal levels of serum anti-S binding and neutralizing antibodies to an early circulating SARS-CoV-2 strain as well as emerging variants, especially in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, who produced the most robust serologic responses. By examining fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of draining axillary LNs, we identified GC B cells that bound S protein in all participants sampled after primary immunization. Remarkably, high frequencies of S-binding GC B cells and PBs were sustained in these draining LNs for at least twelve weeks after the booster immunization. S-binding GC B cell-derived monoclonal antibodies predominantly targeted the receptor binding domain of the S protein, with fewer clones binding to the N-terminal domain or to epitopes shared with the S proteins of the human betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1. The latter cross-reactive B cell clones had higher levels of somatic hypermutation compared to those that only recognized SARS-CoV-2 S protein, suggesting a memory B cell origin. Our studies demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccination of humans induces a persistent GC B cell response, enabling the generation of robust humoral immunity.",,,1624987752,{},h3gmxcd,True,t3_oad00g,False,False,t3_oad00g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oad00g/sarscov2_mrna_vaccines_induce_persistent_human/h3gmxcd/,1625237105,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The WHO's statement that vaccinated people should wear masks is completely on point for most of the world: less than 25% of the population has gotten a first dose, and it's  really important to buy more time for more vaccinations by slowing the spread.  In the US it makes less since, as time isn't going to do much except bring a higher-risk period in fall.  Still, mask wearing in most public situations is really low cost so...maybe it's worth it.

I think that's part of the problem. There is a lot of information out there of wildly varying truth and quality. One of the central problems of modern society is that nobody can understand everything.

It's one thing to say that someone is simply relying upon ""false authority,"" where authority is a figure that holds (false) power, but another to say that I am relying upon the advice and recommendations from numerous scientists. I assumed that you would agree that scientists are reliable, but if you disagree with this, than you must assume that my argument relies on an appeal to a false authority, where the false authority represents numerous scientists and researchers. So unless you are willing to state outright that you believe vaccine researchers and scientists are false authorities, you cannot claim that my argument suffers from an appeal to a false authority.

It is true that we can only make conclusions on 6 months based on real world evidence. But it seems like a poor decision to not also rely upon decades of vaccine research that theorizes that these vaccines will be safe long into the future. This research and prior vaccines have given us the evidence that these new covid vaccines will not cause long-term harm. There is evidence that this is true, but perhaps it is a different type of evidence than you are willing to accept. I find the decision to *not accept* that evidence to be a poor decision, but that is ultimately for everyone to decide. Nevertheless, you are essentially making an argument that relies on proving a negative, which requires an inordinate burden of proof. I should point out that [one of the articles I linked](https://www.chop.edu/news/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine) says clearly the following about mRNA vaccines:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Although COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are new, this type of vaccine has been studied in people before.** mRNA vaccines against HIV, rabies, Zika and flu have been tested in phase 1 and phase 2 trials in people. The technology has also been used in clinical trials as a way to treat some cancers. Even though these products have not been licensed for use in people, these efforts provided important information about mRNA technology and its safety.

In other words, mRNA vaccines aren't completely new as you claim. Moreover, they have been developed for decades. The research that was used to develop these vaccines include fundamental and applied research. [As this article explains (the path to the mRNA covid vaccines)](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/52424.html), fundamental research focuses on understanding the underlying mechanisms of biology, the cellular and molecular factors, and so forth. Fundamental research has led to a better understanding of how the vaccines work, and a better understanding about their long term safety. In other words, scientists are claiming they will be safe not only from prior knowledge of past vaccines, but because they also understand the mechanisms with which they function. 

I don't think I made your argument a strawman. Your argument gives me the impression that scientists have no clue how the mRNA vaccines work, and the only way to find out what will happen in the future is to just wait. There are other approaches‚Äîscience no doubt requires hypotheses and tests, but informed theory is equally important. Anyway, if you wanted a *real* strawman: Your claims are in many ways equivalent to looking at water and saying, ""I don't know if this water will be wet because I haven't tested this particular water."" Of course, this lacks a lot of nuance, but the fact remains that science has made the claim that the new vaccines are safe and effective, and all signs are pointing to them being very safe in the long term as well. 

The basis of my belief is informed by my own research.

&gt;&gt;‚ÄùMost of the coronavirus vaccines are designed to train the body to recognize the spike protein, or parts of it -- the place where Delta Plus' extra mutation is.‚Äù

&gt;&gt;‚ÄùHowever, there isn't enough evidence to determine anything conclusively yet and other experts have expressed caution.‚Äù

So, again, you cherry picked information from an article to make it look like they‚Äôre making a big deal out of nothing.

‚Ä¢ 30% of mild COVID-19 patients have reduced taste and smell after 90 days.  
‚Ä¢  5% of mild COVID-19 patients have dyspnoea after 30 days.  
‚Ä¢ Cough, sore throat, headache, muscle pain, and fever are not increased after 30 days.  
‚Ä¢ Women and older persons are more susceptible to COVID-19 symptoms.  
  
____  
____  
**Objective**  
Our study aimed to compare symptoms day by day for non-hospitalized individuals testing positive and negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).  
  
**Methods**  
In total, 210 positive-test and 630 negative-test healthcare workers in the Central Denmark Region were followed for up to 90 days after testing, between April and June, 2020. Their daily reported COVID-19-related symptoms were compared graphically and by logistic regression.  
  
**Results**
Thirty per cent of the positive-test and close to 0% of the negative-test participants reported a reduced sense of taste and smell during all 90 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 86.07, 95% CI 22.86‚Äì323). Dyspnea was reported by an initial 20% of positive-test participants, declining to 5% after 30 days, without ever reaching the level of the negative-test participants (aOR 6.88, 95% CI 2.41‚Äì19.63). Cough, headache, sore throat, muscle pain, and fever were temporarily more prevalent among the positive-test participants; after 30 days, no increases were seen. Women and older participants were more susceptible to long-lasting COVID-19 symptoms.  
  
**Conclusion**
The prevalence of long-lasting reduced sense of taste and smell is highly increased in mild COVID-19 patients. This pattern is also seen for dyspnea at a low level, but not for cough, sore throat, headache, muscle pain, or fever.",,,1624990370,{},h3gt3xh,True,t3_oadulz,False,False,t3_oadulz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oadulz/daybyday_symptoms_following_positive_and_negative/h3gt3xh/,1625240696,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Nurses with 30+ years experience are taking pension cuts to get out early if they can. Newer nurses do a year and leave for icu or outpatient or NP school. And it seems like most patients view a hospital stay as a hotel stay. I cannot even tell you some of the stories of vile human behavior because they‚Äôre borderline traumatic. 

I‚Äôve only been assaulted once in 2021 (god forbid you try to place oxygen on a hypoxic COVID!). All of our new grads for the next couple years are going to need way more time to learn the skills they missed out on because of COVID (not their fault), and they‚Äôre going to be taught by ‚Äúbeen stretched too thin for too many years nurses leftover after everyone logical enough leaves.

[],,markhpc,,,[],,,,text,t2_x7cmh,False,False,[],"I'm (somewhat) immunocompromised.  The answer is... complicated.  I haven't dug into the very latest research but did review most of the latest research about 2 months ago.  At the time, the studies were all fairly small, and the biggest ones only really made claims about much lower seroconversion rates after a single vaccine dose (and may have been limited to organ transplants, don't remember).  There appears to be significant difference depending on what kind of treatment you are getting.  To really understand what's going on, you want to look at are the IgG and IgA levels for determining seroconversion in the data itself.  Since I specifically was focused on vaccine efficacy for IBD patients who are immunocompromised, much of this is focused specifically on IBD/Remicade.

&amp;#x200B;

1) [https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(21)00648-X/pdf](https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(21)00648-X/pdf)

If you scroll all the way to the end, you can see in figure 1 the samples relative to positive sample thresholds for IgG for both IBD patients and HCW controls.¬† If you look closely, there are number of samples after the first vaccine dose that don't appear to cross the positive test threshold, but all of the subjects who received 2 doses did.

2) [https://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2021/03/24/annrheumdis-2021-220272#DC1](https://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2021/03/24/annrheumdis-2021-220272#DC1)

Probably the most important/positive result here is for Anti-Sars-CoV2-IgG.¬† Even though those patients with CID had a lower BAU/ml level vs the control group in 1A, they all were higher than the cut-off which is why the researchers said that there were no non-responders.

3) [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/03/29/2021.03.25.21254335/F5.large.jpg](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/03/29/2021.03.25.21254335/F5.large.jpg)

they don't have many 2 dose samples vs 1 dose samples (I'm hoping giving the overall size of the study that they will be following up with more data).¬† The samples they do have show a significant improvement for 2 dose though with the geometric mean switching from being below the 15 u/ml seroconversion threshold for 1 dose to above it.

These are all fairly small studies, but the general trend seems to be that folks taking remicade (and perhaps other biologics) for autoimmune diseases show lower antibody response and likely have much lower seroconversion rates after a single vaccine dose, but especially with mRNA vaccines still show relatively high seroconversion rates after 2 properly spaced doses, even if the rates are still below the general population.

We understand that SARS-CoV-2 has a very low mutation rate, so it takes time for point mutations to build up. It‚Äôs not like influenza which gains mutations so fast that one person can have multiple variants inside them.

We also understand that there are multiple binding domains that antibodies target, so even if one binding domain mutates to the point where it‚Äôs unrecognisable by the antibodies produced by vaccines, the others can still be bound to neutralize the virus.

We also understand that a single point mutation is unlikely to render the binding domain unrecognisable by antibodies. It would take a very drastic change (which would likely ruin the virus‚Äô ability to infect cells) or multiple smaller changes.

Considering this, as long as we continue testing and sequencing new variants we can predict how much of a threat it is.

Combine that with a year of more people being hospitalised due the vaccine than the virus (and some sad stories of disabilities gained), and more deaths too, and you just can't win back that public perception. Short of gagging media or making AZ jabs compulsory, it's a lost cause.

[],,followupquestion,,,[],,,,text,t2_kbhv0,False,False,[],"Your quote says twelve weeks is long Covid. So after three months 7% of kids under twelve still had symptoms? You do realize that‚Äôs more than one in twenty, right? And you realize that those stats are based on older variants, most likely the Alpha variant given the time it‚Äôs been the dominant variant in the UK and US? So if one million children get infected, that‚Äôs 70,000 with long-term symptoms like difficult breathing or chronic fatigue, or everybody‚Äôs favorite, the brain fog?

Why do you assume they won‚Äôt catch it? What magic talisman do children embody that they‚Äôre immune from original COVID, let alone the more infectious variants of it were seeing? I know two kids who caught it, the first catching it at preschool (which was taking precautions but clearly not enough) and passed it on to their sibling. They both have made full recoveries but them being lucky doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôll risk my two kids under 12 getting lifelong complications from something I can help prevent. 

The new Delta variant is very infectious, making up [at least 20% of infections this month](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/5-things-to-know-delta-variant-covid). If it can get through fully vaccinated people‚Äôs immune systems, it‚Äôs a cakewalk to get through an unvaccinated immune system, and we just dropped the mask mandates protecting [more than 150 MM Americans](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/). Thanks to contact tracking we can watch it spread via [‚Äúfleeting contact‚Äù](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2021/06/28/infection-through-fleeting-contact-with-the-delta-variant-leads-to-lockdowns-across-australia/) because ‚Äúwith the Delta variant, we‚Äôre seeing very fleeting contact leading to transmission. At the start of this pandemic, I spoke about 15 minutes of close contact being a concern. Now it looks like it‚Äôs five to 10 seconds that‚Äôs a concern. The risk is so much higher now than it was only a year ago.‚Äù
 
Millions of kids will get it. Millions of adults will get it. You and I will quite possibly get it, unless you and everybody else gets on the mask train in a hurry. The only thing we can do to effectively slow the spread is wear masks and continue to vaccinate, expanding vaccinations to children under 12 when encouraged, because the smaller the pool of unvaccinated people, the fewer opportunities for the variants to further evolve. Given that there‚Äôs already a [Delta Plus variant](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/24/delta-plus-covid-variant-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html) that appears to have some immunity to treatment, further mutations are a matter of when and how many, not if. The vaccines *probably* help reduce the spread (the studies that I‚Äôve seen aren‚Äôt as detailed in the after-vaccination behavior of test subjects as I‚Äôd like), but they definitely help in stopping deaths and hospitalizations, and for that alone we should be encouraging them for anybody over 12 that isn‚Äôt immunocompromised. 

We also know that there‚Äôs a large portion of the population that will never get vaccinated, whether by choice or due to immunocompromise. To protect them and ourselves, wearing a mask around other people just makes sense. Why wouldn‚Äôt you?

By Jeff Manning | The Oregonian/OregonLive
9-11 minutes

After 18 years as a nurse, much of it in the emergency department, Jeremy Lail considered himself a battle-tested veteran.

But last week, he asked his bosses at Providence Portland Medical Center if he could go on leave. Lail said he‚Äôs overwhelmed by the horde of patients seeking treatment at his ER and unnerved at the erratic, angry nature of many of those patients.

‚ÄúI dreaded going to work,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI found myself thinking, is this the day someone is going to pull a gun and shoot me? We‚Äôre seeing how society can devolve right now. I‚Äôve been dealing with a lot of anxiety and depression.‚Äù

For months, hospital workers have wanted nothing more than for the pandemic to end and life to return to some semblance of normalcy. But the much-deserved respite has yet to begin. Instead, a combination of understaffing and a tidal wave of seriously ill patients who have deferred health care for months has made life in the ER as bad or worse than the height of the pandemic.

It‚Äôs a recipe for disaster that is unfolding at hospitals across the country: Blend emotionally exhausted caregivers with emotionally disturbed patients, throw in a wave of street violence and the departure of some of the most experienced workers on the wards due to fatigue and burnout, and voila, America has its latest health care crisis.

Many employees argue there is another key ingredient added by the hospitals that makes the end result particularly toxic: A penny-pinching mentality that allows the understaffing to develop in the first place.

Meanwhile, the dangers health care workers confront have changed. A year ago, hospital front-line staffers faced the deadly threat of infection. Now, emergency department staffers worry about assault as more patients come in impaired, angry and, sometimes, armed.

OHSU Hospital‚Äôs ER is installing a metal detector next month that all patients and visitors will have to go through before entry. Twice in recent months, staffers have found patients or visitors in the ER carrying weapons.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been here eight years and I‚Äôve never seen this many acutely ill patients coming through the door,‚Äù said Dr. Mary Tanski, interim chair of the OHSU Emergency Department. ‚ÄúWhen we see sicker patients, that‚Äôs a stress. Nurses were already tired. They‚Äôve been at the front lines for a year. It‚Äôs to the point that we have seen some of our nursing colleagues leave the profession.‚Äù

TRAFFIC JAM

When COVID-19 arrived in Oregon, many hospitals experienced an immediate drop in business. In the first months of the pandemic, OHSU‚Äôs emergency department saw patient volume fall by half.

Some hospitals figured they could afford to cut staff, save some money and lessen the financial pounding they were taking as a result of the pandemic.

But ER traffic is hard to predict. By law, they don‚Äôt have the luxury of turning people away.

Sure enough, ER demand surged this spring to a level that caught everyone by surprise.

After studiously avoiding hospitals and doctors‚Äô offices for a year due to COVID-19, many of the patients are too sick to be treated and released. That has led to another problem: Some hospitals don‚Äôt have enough staffed beds elsewhere in the hospital to house the influx.

That leads to ‚Äúboarding,‚Äù the practice of holding patients in the ER, until a hospital bed or some other destination can be found. The practice is controversial because it keeps patients in limbo and because it blocks the normal flow of sick patients into the hospital. Behavioral health patients are particularly prone to boarding because of the chronic shortage of beds dedicated to their needs.

The backlog of boarded patients means more delays for new ER patients, who can wait hours to see a nurse. Understandably angry patients and their families at times lash out at hospital staff.

Karlee Hoffart is a four-year veteran of the ER at Kaiser Permanente Sunnyside Medical Center in Clackamas. ‚ÄúI love the emergency department,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bit of an adrenaline junky. I like being a valued member of a small team.‚Äù

But things have changed in recent months.

‚ÄúWe cannot move our patients,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere are days when I start a shift, half of our beds are taken up by folks needing a hospital bed. Sometimes, they can wait 24 hours.‚Äù

In the interim, it is Hoffart and her colleagues who must treat them.

‚ÄúWe are no longer just ER nurses,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe are mental health counselors, we are hospital nurses, we are being asked to do it all, with no extra help.‚Äù

NOWHERE TO ‚ÄòDIVERT‚Äô

But the problem is more than just a shortage of skilled workers and staffed hospital beds.

Emergency responders are delivering patient loads that are too much for hospital emergency rooms to handle. The surge of calls began several months ago and only worsened in the last two months.

Emergency calls always spike in the summer as more people are on the roads. In Multnomah County, the number would typically increase to about 300 a day. This month, the county is running on average 390 a day.

When Portland-area hospital ERs are jammed, they go on ‚Äúdivert‚Äù status, meaning ambulances that would normally go there are diverted to another hospital. It‚Äôs never been unusual for one or two metro-area hospitals to get overwhelmed on a busy night.

But in recent months it‚Äôs become almost a daily occurrence for every hospital in the area to go on divert.

OHSU, for example, spent about 150 hours per month in divert status in April and May 2020. A year later, Tanski confirmed, OHSU‚Äôs emergency department was full and off-limits between 450 and 500 hours per month.

As OHSU is one of the region‚Äôs key trauma hospitals that takes the most serious cases.

‚ÄúWhen we‚Äôre on divert it presents a challenge,‚Äù Tanski said. ‚ÄúIt just leads to this spiral effect.‚Äù

That is a sea change for local county officials who run a sort of air-traffic control system coordinating ambulances with hospitals. In May of last year, all local hospitals went on total divert status maybe once or twice, said Shane Ryan, a spokesman for Metro West Ambulance, which serves Washington County. This May, all hospitals were diverted 54% of the time.

Ambulances have made some unusual trips in response. Tualatin Valley Fire &amp; Rescue had to transport a patient to a hospital in Corvallis after Portland-area hospitals turned them away, said Cassandra Ulven, spokeswoman for the department.

The deluge of shootings and other street violence has contributed to the surge.

‚ÄúOur trauma volume is huge,‚Äù said Jon Jui, medical director of Multnomah County Emergency Medical Services. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never seen people getting shot at this rate, often at random. I‚Äôve been doing EMS for over three decades, and I‚Äôve never seen problems this sustained, this prolonged. We have a very significant strain on our emergency system.‚Äù

SLOW TO STAFF UP

Kaiser and Providence nurses argue the solution to the problem is simple: Hospitals need to hire more staff, and they need to retain the talent they have.

Hospital officials said they are trying to do exactly that.

‚ÄúNo one would dispute that this is a challenging time across the state, region and country when it comes to caregiver staffing, going on divert and wait times in emergency departments,‚Äù Providence spokesman Gary Walker said. ‚ÄúProvidence is actively managing the needs, including spending hundreds of hours in recruiting additional caregivers. We are excited to have a group of 54 new nurses joining us for ED residency in a couple of weeks.‚Äù

Legacy Health Systems said it has hired more than 250 nurses in 2021 and will soon accept 50 additional nurses into its residency program.

Providence, Kaiser and Legacy all declined to provide any information about nurse attrition or turnover.

Kaiser said it is hiring so-called ‚Äútravelling nurses‚Äù from employment agencies to fill the gaps in its own payroll, and it‚Äôs offering sign-on bonuses for registered nurses who will work nights in the ER.

‚ÄúThe nursing shortage affecting the whole nation is impacting the Northwest region as well,‚Äù said Kaiser spokeswoman Debbie Karman. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre actively working to recruit and hire nursing staff.‚Äù

Hoffart, the Kaiser nurse, suggested Kaiser should concentrate on retaining its trained veterans. Attrition is enormous. ‚ÄúShe and her colleagues estimate that half or more of the nurses who worked in the Kaiser Sunnyside ER last year have left the department.‚Äù.

Hoffart is a steward for the nurse‚Äôs union, the Oregon Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals, which started negotiating a new contract early this month. Staffing is a central issue.

Kim Stewart, another ER nurse at Kaiser Sunnyside, said there‚Äôs no bigger priority.

‚ÄúKaiser has a great patient care model,‚Äù Stewart said. ‚ÄúBut without the people there to do it right, it doesn‚Äôt work. I don‚Äôt even want more money or more benefits. I just want staff.‚Äù

Lail, the Providence Portland nurse who recently went on leave, echoes those sentiments. He is a steward in his union, the Oregon Nurses Association, which recently filed a grievance with Providence over staffing issues that was signed by 75% of its nursing staff.

Lail doesn‚Äôt know what his future has in store. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to quit, I don‚Äôt want to leave. But it‚Äôs getting really hard,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe money is really not that important to me. I just want the support and the right co-workers to do my job.‚Äù

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

But if you actually look at the trial data, the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine didn‚Äôt really achieve ‚Äúfull‚Äù protection until about 55 days after vaccination (and even then, efficacy was lower than Pfizer). On the other hand, Pfizer‚Äôs trial actually showed full efficacy 7 days after the second dose, so 28 days after the first dose. (It also looked really good starting around 10 days after the first dose).

So if you actually go by the trial data, Pfizer is 28 days and J&amp;J is ~55 days.

On top of that, J&amp;J appears to have taken a hit in terms of efficacy with the Delta variant whereas Pfizer is holding up very well.

So with that in mind, I would 100% recommend getting Pfizer.

Well, in the handful of countries with infinite supplies of Pfizer, that's an important thing.

Dr. Ellebedy‚Äôs team found that 15 weeks after the first dose of vaccine, the germinal center was still highly active in all 14 of the participants, and that the number of memory cells that recognized the coronavirus had not declined.

‚ÄúUsually by four to six weeks, there‚Äôs not much left,‚Äù said Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona. But germinal centers stimulated by the mRNA vaccines are ‚Äústill going, months into it, and not a lot of decline in most people.‚Äù

Dr. Bhattacharya noted that most of what scientists know about the persistence of germinal centers is based on animal research. The new study is the first to show what happens in people after vaccination.

But a common belief in these comments and also by many people I see each day is that I should continue to wear a mask. 

At this point those over 12 who want a vaccine can walk right in to CVS/Walmart ect and have one. It's been like that for months. I'm really growing tired of making accomodations for people who could get vaccinated but have chosen not too. 

Maryland had 37 cases reported yesterday. Positivity rate was .57% and caseload was less than 1/100000.  74% of residents have had at least one shot. 

So seriously....what is the goal post, what is the target metric for fully vaccinated people to feel comfortable and safe without a mask?

This is the video of their June 10th meeting. I listened to the whole thing live so maybe I misinterpreted something but they did agree on increasing the number of participants required for trials and length of time data should be collected. That part is near the end. Also throughout the meeting there was 0 mention of long covid/PASC and many times members agreed that there is low risk for kids under 12 so EUA is not warranted. 

There was quite a bit of time spent discussing how since covid is so low risk for kids it would be irresponsible to give EUA for a vaccine to limit spread for general public health benefits. Their take on this was that it would not be right to vaccinate kids against covid ""just"" to limit spread and potential for the virus to evolve because it is really no immediate direct health risk to kids. This is what I heard them saying not what I think. I personally think the risk for kids directly is high enough now and that even if that were not true the potential for this to become more risky for kids would be a concern as well. Of course, we need data to evaluate safety and effectiveness of the vaccine in these age groups. So far, the data we have looks good. 

I am hoping they will change their mind BEFORE we see things getting worse for kids (i.e., more cases due to changing social behaviors, more troublesome variants etc) and I hope that there are people within the FDA who are taking potential long term effects from Covid into consideration moreso than this committee.",,,1624978390,{},h3g18hq,False,t3_o9mucv,False,True,t1_h3fyg4t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o9mucv/dr_scott_gottlieb_says_daily_new_covid_cases_in/h3g18hq/,1625225025,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Having the vaccine means you're relatively well protected, not invincible.  If you do catch COVID post-vaccine (and it DOES happen), you will have an overwhelmingly positive chance of no serious complications.  Nobody can answer authoritatively what the long-term effects of catching COVID post-vaccine are, because we aren't to the ""long term"" phase yet.  We weren't able to start trials 10 years ago to see what the 10 year effect is.

It could be 10 years from now, all humans have a little scar in their immune system, like trees do during a wildfire.  That could be all that's left of COVID.  It could be that people who caught the actual virus are extremely susceptible to otherwise mundane illnesses later.  It could be only people who got the vaccine get acute liver failure a decade from now.",,,1624990126,{},h3gsjv1,False,t3_o9yf1g,False,True,t1_h3faput,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o9yf1g/la_county_urges_everyone_to_wear_mask_indoors_as/h3gsjv1/,1625240380,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,SparePlatypus,,,[],,,,text,t2_1apco6a1,False,False,[],"This. There were obvious caveats in that referenced study in that it was high contact settings and primarily one dose (meaning two doses likely to further increase protection), 

But some extrapolate the one dose findings to imply two doses will he near 100% protective which is doubtful given the risk of symptomatic infection vs 1 vs 2 doses or mRNA for example, does not generate as extreme infection differentials, and the dominance of systemic, AB's are projected to not be 'enough' to catch the virus early at the local mucosal sites to prevent infection entirely at the beginning 

The other caveat, in reverse -- as you mention is the timing of the study predating Delta dominance.   Delta is demonstrably more transmissable and associated with lower cycle count-- preliminary evidence shows those infected spread to bigger clusters more effectively.  In other words, despite that vaccinated persons do indeed have lower risk of spreading the virus, (lower viral loads, faster clearance) etc. 

This misinformation that vaccinated people 'cannot spread' the virus- (which I see come up at least once a day here, often heavily upvoted)  needs to stop for the sake of public health. It's not about 'spreading doom' or wanting people to mask up forever, vaccines are the main way out - but let's not deny the data. 

We see great data from Singapore with extremely competent contact tracing that demonstrates the notion that vaccinated people 'cannot' catch, spread (as CDC director claimed recently, only for CDC to have to walk back) is simply false. 

https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-vaccination-comments-director-rochelle-walensky-2021-4?op=1&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T

In short, vaccines are tremendous help but not 100% silver bullet.  Particularly against certain emerging variants like Delta.  Personally I'm really interested in seeing the results of intranasal vaccines in coming months--  all available indications from preclinical data are that they should more effectively stop virus in upper respiratory tract-- at least for younger populations ie bring us closer to 'sterilizing immunity' and thereby have stronger effect on neutering transmission vs all current intramuscular candidates",,,1624987326,{},h3glx2r,False,t3_oa8493,False,False,t1_h3gdwon,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oa8493/moderna_provides_a_clinical_update_on_the/h3glx2r/,1625236538,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; No u. You made the initial claim, I already asked for your data

[Here's my data.  324 covid deaths for ages 0-17.](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-by-Sex-and-Age/9bhg-hcku/data)

So that's 324 deaths in 22% of US population.  Scale that up to 100%, and you get about 1500 deaths.  Looks like my earlier ballpark was high.  But anyway it highlights the low risk nature of covid for under 18.  If every age group was same risk as them we'd have 1500 deaths in US instead of 600,000.

No drug is 100% safe including the vaccines, there is always a risk/benefit analysis to consider and factors like above (already immune, young children etc)


That is a question of policy and not of science, and there are so many factors that go into it that it‚Äôs hard to really evaluate in such a simple way. First and foremost, there may be red tape/bureaucracy in the way of making recommendations based on serostatus, since the FDA has strict guidelines on how trials are run and what they mean (this has been also proposed as a potential reason why, despite evidence suggesting it is unnecessary, the second dose is still recommended even for infected individuals). Second, testing everyone for antibody status is expensive and time-consuming, and policy makers may want to incentivize people just getting the shot as quickly as possible, as there‚Äôs strong evidence that vaccination saves lives, and the delay, whether measured in days or weeks, that would be caused by people getting antibody tested first, would almost certainly result in lost lives. Third, consider the propensity people have to misinterpret advice, which becomes stronger the more complex the advice is - when someone says ‚Äúget vaccinated‚Äù, it‚Äôs simple advice, and hard to misinterpret. When they say ‚Äúget vaccinated, but only if you haven‚Äôt had xyz‚Äù, then it starts to muddy the water. Now they have to explain ‚Äúhey we ONLY mean if you have confirmed previous infection and antibodies measurable above this level‚Äù, and people may miss or ignore that part and just decide ‚ÄúI felt sick in March last year so I‚Äôm good‚Äù.

Now for people paying lots of attention to scientific articles it starts to come across as dishonest sometimes,  but honestly I think that‚Äôs present in almost all policy, as policymakers try to decide what makes the most sense to advise people, they have to account for human psychology on top of the facts of the situation.

I think in general, policymakers and regulators have clearly decided that the vaccine is *safe enough* when given to people who were previously infected, that advising *everyone* to get vaccinated is an acceptable strategy. Now, in the future, if evidence starts to come out that these rare cases of ITP, myocarditis, whatever they are, happen to be strongly related to having a previous infection... That advice to vaccinate everyone may come under more scrutiny, but will still have to be weighed against the lives saved by not delaying vaccination.

It‚Äôs complicated.",,,1624981615,{},h3g8h0j,False,t3_o9hpmq,False,True,t1_h3eqgcx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o9hpmq/a_study_finds_that_the_pfizer_and_moderna/h3g8h0j/,1625228949,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Now, San Diego is more conservative than LA in general, so while I would say we have generally had a pretty strong mask game through this whole thing, people were very happy to be able to shed their masks as well.  

I'd say it depends on the store, workers still generally wear masks, but lots of people don't.  I'd say it's like 60% don't, in general, as I said some stores differ.  BUT, I would say the people I generally see not wearing masks look like people that are probably vaccinated.  

I've been vaccinated for a while, so I'm glad to shed the mask in a lot of situations.  I'm a PhD in microbiology so I feel like I am setting a bad example as I know there are several problems with it in terms of continuous potential transmission, but I also found problems with how people would wear masks outside the way they did, I saw it as unnecessary, though I never said anything about it other than to people close to me, I didn't want people who didn't understand viruses to think a PhD was saying masks didn't work, more that if you are outside in the open in direct sunlight with a decent UV index most of those particles are going to be deactivated and completely inert, if they even had the very very very low possibility of reaching someone's ACE2 with the physiochemistry of being outside.

On the one hand, as someone who completely locked down, I am about to go to my first restaurant in a year and a half and at this point I don't think masks are needed right now.

On the other hand, this subreddit's idea that once you are vaccinated you can ignore everything is completely wrong. Think of vaccine protection as two halves: your personal protection and herd immunity. Your personal protection is great and will almost certainly keep you from going to the hospital or dying. However, herd immunity is the real goal, which is a non zero number but one that will stay low. Think of it this way - the mRNA vaccines are providing about 95% personal protection. Herd immunity brought cases in Maryland from 1500 to 34 - about 98% protection. Right now if you are vaccinated in Maryland then you pretty much have both halves and are good to go, and even if you can't get vaccinated then the herd immunity half is still protecting you pretty well.

The problem now is Delta. Normally, waves are caused by relaxing attitudes and rules too much. If you relax them and don't have a wave (like Maryland these last couple months), then that is a very good sign. However, we are about to switch which strain is dominant. This is the weak point in our understanding that we need to pay attention to. If cases explode, then we need to be ready for further restrictions. Because we have vaccines, I highly doubt we'll return to full blown quarantines. But if things start trending exponentially then a return to masks until we are past the wave to try and get back to herd immunity would be beneficial for everyone - vaccinated and non vaccinated alike. Until that happens though, I wouldn't worry about masks.",,,1624981265,{},h3g7nfq,False,t3_o9yf1g,False,True,t1_h3fj1as,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o9yf1g/la_county_urges_everyone_to_wear_mask_indoors_as/h3g7nfq/,1625228473,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;  
&gt;After all, the seductive logic goes, from an evolutionary perspective it makes no sense for a pathogen to harm the host on which it depends for its survival. According to this reasoning, virulence is little more than a temporary evolutionary imbalance.  
&gt;  
&gt;This comfortable chain of reasoning was rudely broken by the announcement of ‚Äúa realistic possibility‚Äù that the new highly transmissible B117 variant ‚Äúis associated with an increased risk of death‚Äù.  
&gt;  
&gt;Although the evidence is still accruing, early estimates from Nervtag, the UK‚Äôs New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, suggest that B117 may be around 30% more deadly.

&gt;Letting Covid-19 circulate in hope of herd immunity 'could make it more lethal'  
&gt;  
&gt;A deeply entrenched idea, that newly emerged agents of disease inevitably evolve to become more benign over time, is scientifically unfounded, according to new research.  
&gt;  
&gt;**They can, in fact, become more virulent depending on the conditions, and the easier it is for a virus to spread, the more likely it is to do so....**  
&gt;  
&gt;If the pathogen meets resistance to transmission ‚Äì in the form of a recovered and immune or vaccinated host, or social distancing ‚Äì then highly virulent forms perform less well because they die out with their host, and natural selection favours less virulent forms.

From updated CDC site this morning:

‚ÄúA growing body of evidence indicates that people fully vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) are less likely to have asymptomatic infection or to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others. Studies are underway to learn more about the benefits of Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen vaccine. However, the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated people cannot be completely eliminated as long as there is continued community transmission of the virus.‚Äù

With more to be known about the potential for the maskless vaxxed to spread it, it seems like this confusion from the WHO was inevitable. 

I think a lot of the public is just out there wanting to be told what to do, and not what to consider.

Rhetorical Q‚Äôs:

Did you know a lot of unvaccinated are going maskless because of privacy laws?

Did you know the CDC is still studying asymptomatic spread amongst the maskless fully-vaxxed?

Studies from last summer even suggest that masks alone are more efficacious than the vaccines alone. (But both is best, cases fell sharpest during vaccine rollout with mask mandate in tact) Those surges were tied to reopening businesses, not protests

And surprise surprise, turns out that mask usage percentage is all over the board from 0% to 100% depending on where you are and where you are going.  
  
That being said, I'm going to be masking up as a default indoors (and taking other precautions) going forward, for a while.    
  
Like most people here, I was vaccinated this Spring.  Then took a vacation at the end of May, visiting various sites along the Oregon Trail from Missouri to Wyoming (mostly outdoor sites).  Mask usage at nearly every place I visited over eleven days was next-to-zero, and I wasn't wearing a mask, either.    
  
I wasn't worried about COVID.  But instead, I managed to catch a pretty bad cold in the process.  Classic head cold symptoms, first time I've been ill in over a year, just my luck.    
  
Betchya if I was wearing a mask (and taking other related precautions, like diligent hand-washing and distancing) I wouldn't have caught the cold :)  
  
So, at the very least, I'll be wearing a mask, not only for COVID, but also to protect me from what other nasty bugs that could be out there as well.  Getting sick for *any* reason sucks.  I had just gotten used to getting various minor colds throughout my life as just a fact of life, but having spent the last year-plus without getting the sniffles or a cough from someone at work kinda put that into a new perspective.

We can't. The viral load we get if we do get the virus is so small that if we do pass it on to anyone else they are basically getting a vaccines amount of virus in their system... So passing it on is a GOOD THING... old vaccines 10+ years ago were made with dead viruses or small amounts of viruses and that's basically what you're spreading to unvaccinated people if you do spread it to people. 

&gt; Asymptomatic carrier

So? Asymptomatic means we have no symptoms so who cares? Yeah most of us will probably carry the virus but as I said above it doesn't matter if we do cause we can't transmit it... And any virus we do catch makes our immune system even better... So you keeping your mask on makes it easier for some mutation to actually hurt you... Any virus you have in your system right now after full vaccination will be fought off by your immune system strengthening it even more for whatever comes our way later... You wearing a mask doesn't help with that.

There's a lot of the healthcare community that didn't get the vaccine... They were the ones upset... Not the ones that actually believe in vaccines.
