That's what I mean by vaguely legitimate concerns that should have been alleviated by the overwhelming evidence from hundreds of millions of vaccinated people being fine.

Also. While these are the first mRNA vaccines approved for use research on the mRNA vaccine platform has been going on for decades. Hence they were able to produce these vaccines quickly. It's not a new concept.

The mRNA platform makes it very easy to change the mRNA contents of the vaccine to match the disease you want to target. As such it will become far faster to put together vaccines to target new diseases that appear.

Where traditional vaccines require viral proteins to be produced and purified which can take a while to figure out before trials can start. mRNA based platforms make it easy to change the mRNA to target new diseases meaning it will be faster to reach the clinical trial stage.

Religion sycophants and superstitious fools are the norm here, especially with the lack of education and the prevailing poverty. Yet, there's no mass scale hysteria against vaccines. It's because they don't get accentuated and they don't get a platform to spread their poison. This problem is prevalent primarily in the US because they have the have a voice. 

Un-challenged and absolute freedom, contrary to popular belief is actually detrimental to society. America is the 'free-est' country, u can buy AR15s and walk into a school casually, u can be a flat earther and have an Instagram following of more than 1M people, u can be an anti vaxxer and be deemed Moses reincarnate. This leads to a feeling of entitlement among the selfish people of every class in society. Do these people exist elsewhere? Yes, absolutely, probably way more in quantity too but they are also usually stripped of their voice. I know at least 2 people in my own family here in India who are vehement flat earth believers but they don't have any traction on social media and everyone around them gets to be educated on their own accord without having to deal with leaking anti intellectual poison. 

So what's my point? My point is, discrete entities in any society are always going to exist, you just cannot 'educate' everyone. That's one of the drawbacks of free will. I can believe I am superman and no one can really educate me on the fact that I am not if I have a wall of ignorance built up. After the de-platforming, the Trump army has grown smaller but also more vociferous and that's to be expected. However, if de-platforming continues these elements in the American society are eventually going to be reduced to small discrete individuals who won't have the voice or the traction to turn their personal mindset into a national anti intellectual mass movement. They are going to harm their immediate societal cohorts but at least the rest of the public can go about doing their own thing without having to second guess their decision to get vaccinated because of some oonga boonga gobbly whack spouted by someone whose education stems from controversial youtube videos.",,,,1632984190,{},hetml1n,False,t3_pxv04x,False,True,t1_herb8ow,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pxv04x/youtube_is_banning_prominent_antivaccine/hetml1n/,1633126375.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

That I have heard and belive is most hospitals are about 15% lower staffing this year compared to last. Some burn out, some government policy with unemployment benefits, some higher salaries in other sectors etc.  Not just nurses, our kitchen staff is so stretched that we're not allowing families to eat in the cafetería anymore. We're bracing for another 3-5% staff loss from vaccine mandates when the deadline comes. Every nurse is precious right now. I read people on here say thats great and if they don't want to vaccinate they deserve to get fired and they don't want them as a nurse or even people who don't vaccinate shouldn't be allowed in the hospital.  I respectfully disagree. Every life, even the ones who make choices I/others disagree with is precious. Where is the line? What about the guy who repeatedly doesn't take his insulin? He's taking up a bed too. What about a car accident where you don't wear a seatbelt? And last year, those same nurses who were praised as superheroes for working in risky environments were treated with respect and now those same nurses, are vilins.  It's a strange world we live in.

I'm a diabetic, so without insulin my blood glucose kept steadily rising the entire time I was there. By the time I got home the next evening, my blood glucose was close to 400 and I was extremely dehydrated due to not being allowed to drink water and not receiving any IV fluids for close to 24 hours. Turned out to be anemia related symptoms, not a cardiac problem or pulmonary embolism. But the whole experience was scary. The entire hospital was overwhelmed to the point of substandard care.

The problem is there is no legitimate debate to be had between fact and fiction.

If I say it's raining and you say it is sunny how would you find a legitimate moderator? They would need to be undecided on something that is self evident.

Over 100 years of research have shown that vaccines work. There is no legitimate theory that can cast doubt on the efficacy and safety of vaccines in general.

Anyone who claims otherwise is wrong. There is no  'moderator' available because there is no legitimate debate to be had just an explanation as to why vaccines are safe.

For the covid vaccine there were some potentially legitimate concerns early on. But at this point hundreds of millions of people have been vaccinated with few issues.

A *reasonable* interpretation would be that the vaccine is roughly twice as protective as a previous infection, **but both might still provide a substantial amount of protection.**  Plenty of studies (and a basic understanding of the immune system) suggest that a previous infection is at least somewhat effective.

We also should really be looking at efficacy against hospitalization and death, as well.


As a final note, **this is just department of health data, NOT an ""academic report""**.

They need to look at potential confounders/do a more rigorous statistical analysis.  To reiterate, previous studies, done this way, did show a good amount of ""natural immunity.""

[],,ToriCanyons,,,[],,,,text,t2_9np1cfb,False,False,[],"Related from NIH: [https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/autoimmune-response-found-many-covid-19](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/autoimmune-response-found-many-covid-19)

More than a year and a half into the COVID-19 pandemic, much about how the human body responds to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, remains unclear. Some people have a severe or fatal reaction to infection, while others show no obvious symptoms. Some people bounce back quickly. Others experience so-called “long COVID,” symptoms that persist long past recovery from the initial stages of illness.

Researchers are beginning to understand how the human immune system contributes to the varied responses to COVID-19. Autoantibodies—immune system proteins that mistakenly target the body’s own tissues—may underlie some of this variation. Autoantibodies are found in a wide range of autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Many people with low levels of autoantibodies in their blood have no obvious symptoms.

A recent study found that autoantibodies that existed before infection with SARS-CoV-2 may account for 20% or more of serious or fatal COVID-19 cases. Scientists have wondered if infection with SARS-CoV-2 could also result in the production of autoantibodies in people who didn’t have them before they got sick.

To look at this question, researchers screened for a range of autoantibodies in blood samples from almost 150 people hospitalized with COVID-19 and 41 healthy volunteers. The team was led by Drs. PJ Utz at Stanford University, Chrysanthi Skevaki at Philipps University Marburg in Germany, and Eline Luning Prak at the University of Pennsylvania.

The study was funded by several NIH components, primarily the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Results were published on September 14, 2021, in Nature Communications.

The researchers found that about half of the people hospitalized with severe COVID-19 had at least one type of autoantibody circulating in their bloodstream. In contrast, only 15% of healthy controls had such antibodies.

About 50 of the people with COVID-19 had blood samples drawn on more than one day, including the day they were first hospitalized. The scientists found that about 20% of these didn’t have any autoantibodies when they were first admitted but developed them over the course of their illness.

In some people, the levels of autoantibodies were very high, close to the levels seen in autoimmune diseases. Common targets of these misdirected antibodies included immune system proteins such as cytokines, which normally help coordinate the immune response.

The mechanisms behind the production of such autoantibodies aren’t yet clear. Widespread and long-term inflammation during severe COVID-19 may cause the immune system to produce antibodies to pieces of the virus it wouldn’t normally recognize. Some of those pieces might resemble human proteins enough to trigger the production of autoantibodies.

Excessive inflammation could also boost production of autoantibodies that had previously only existed in the body at very low levels. Vaccination against COVID-19 is much less inflammatory than infection with the virus. In a separate study that looked at COVID vaccination, none of the healthy volunteers developed autoantibodies.

“Patients who, in response to vaccination, quickly mount appropriate antibody responses to the viral spike protein should be less likely to develop autoantibodies,” Utz says.

The team is beginning to look at whether autoantibodies produced during COVID-19 could lead to autoimmune diseases later in life. More work is also needed to understand how autoantibodies contribute to COVID symptoms.",,,,1632959472,{},hesdrbe,True,t3_py7fvk,False,False,t3_py7fvk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/py7fvk/when_the_immune_response_makes_covid19_worse/hesdrbe/,1633101932.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier, due to the COVID-19 outbreak’s complex developments, many health establishments that did not meet safety standards in COVID prevention and control were closed temporarily. Many private and public hospitals were converted to treat only COVID-19 patients.  
  
Speaking at a press meeting held on Thursday, Lê Hòa Bình, vice chairman of the city People’s Committee, said these facilities, classified in three groups, would be allowed to reopen.  
  
They include general and specialised hospitals and medical clinics specialising in general internal medicine, cardiology, respiratory, gastroenterology, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, orthopedics, dental - jaw - face, ear - nose - throat, eye, aesthetics, rehabilitation, psychiatry, oncology, dermatology, traditional medicine, nutrition and therapies for drug addiction treatment, HIV/AIDS treatment, and surgery.  
  
Clinics for testing, diagnostic imaging, X-ray, counseling, occupational diseases, and family medicine will resume operating.  
  
Also reopening are medical establishments providing healthcare services related to injecting, dressing changes, pulse counting, temperature measurement, blood pressure measurement; home health care; first aid and assistance in transporting patients in the country and abroad; and prescription eyeglass services.    
  
Pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and medical supply and equipment establishments will reopen.  
  
People from other provinces coming to the city for health examination and treatment will be asked to have a paper from hospitals in provinces that says that they need to be transferred to the city for treatment.     
  
The city will work with provinces to streamline procedures for transport. They should not go to the city in individual vehicles for health examination and treatment, Bình said.  
  
Spa, massage, and beauty service establishments will continue to be closed.    
  
Bình said that the number of hopitalised COVID-19 patients, severely ill patients, and deaths is falling in the city.

The new directive aims to defend against the pandemic while facilitating socio-economic growth and helping residents enter “a new normal”, according to Lê Hòa Bình, deputy chairman of HCM City People’s Committee.  
  
“The city will stop issuing travelling permits and instead apply information technologies to make it less cumbersome for locals to travel. But safety has to be ensured,” he said.  
  
Two mobile applications are currently being used to monitor travel: Y tế HCM (HCM City Health) that certifies vaccination or recovery from COVID-19, and VNEID for online health declarations.   
  
City residents travelling or visiting different establishments, such as businesses, health facilities and public transport, will show their QR codes on smartphone apps or papers (have received at least one vaccine shot more than two weeks prior to entry to establishment or public transport, or have recovered from COVID-19 within the last six months).  
  
Col. Nguyễn Sĩ Quang, deputy director of HCM City Police, said that officials would conduct random inspections on the road and that city residents should fill out online health declarations before travelling.  
  
City residents are not allowed to travel freely outside the city, and if they need to, they must be permitted by the city’s Department of Transport and follow their regulations.  
  
HCM City will maintain its inspection checkpoints across its borders and will check vehicles and travellers' QR codes and other identification methods.  
  
Public transport services can resume operation depending on each area's pandemic conditions, but only at 50 per cent of the vehicle’s maximum capacity.

It depends on how smart or tech savvy the group is, tbh. If they're dummies that can barely figure out a computer then the threat of them spreading their toxic ideas is very, very low. However, if they have 'new blood'  that know their way around computers or any type of internet security the threat of them going deep underground and still having influence is high indeed.

About the only solid way you could break up movements is what they did to dozens of civil rights leaders way back when (thanks racist Nixon): arresting and naming them. Granted, the civil rights movement didn't count on anonymity but their lives were indeed ruined when the police locked them up for marijuana possession or other minor offenses and then they threw away the key. There's a reason there aren't as many civil rights leaders in this country than there were in the days of Martin Luther King (especially ones that were well-known enough to actually create changes). Movements *can* slowly start to die off with deplatforming if the group doesn't know what to do with themselves afterwards or the leadership is fractured. (And the government made very, very sure that when they 'deplatformed' the civil rights activists the only ones left were the least radical and inexperienced of the bunch).

That's probably one of the only tools LEOs have left that will have some type of lasting impact: infiltration and arrests.

Short of talking to experts in modern warfare/extremism those are probably your only options (along with deplatforming as a more visible and less effective tool), tbh. Though, if I were a smart person working for the FBI or any security organization funded by the government I'd definitely invest in the technology sector, so to speak. Have a business that, I don't know, only accepts bigots and use it as a honeypot to collect personal information to track and arrest the biggest contributors (and any that might be possible replacements) and get LE to scoop them all up in a type of shock-and-awe event that is coordinated at an inter-state level. It would be difficult and would take a long, long time to catch a good chunk of these chucklefucks in some type of treasonous/criminal behavior but it would be effective if done right (we don't need another Waco but I would be remiss if I didn't mention a way it could go sideways if you let incompetent people run the show).

The only thing the 'normal' bigots understand and are afraid of is consequences. The more 'normal' bigots a movement has the more effective the Top Brass of a Movement are at carrying out attacks and the more money they'll get to acquire for their end-goals. If Bigot Dan is the die-hard extremist that wants to blow shit up to make a point, Bigot Maggie (who is the 'normal' bigot) might believe wholly in the movement but might not really want to take part in 'illegal' things because Bigot Maggie has a life she likes and doesn't want it to be over because they got caught; so, instead she just donates money and goes to meetings that only the other 'normies' go to that doesn't expose them to the Top Brass' planning. Bigot Maggie gets plausible deniability and the Top Brass gets money to fund their future plans while having the 'veneer' of being a legitimate and 'non-violent' movement by having 'normie' meetings exposed to the public/non-extremist members. The only thing that would stop someone like Bigot Maggie is the fear of getting caught vs. serving the 'movement'. This is why it's important to fracture the leadership of a movement of bigots: The lasting consequences the 'top guys' face sends the message to all the smaller ones below that the book will be thrown at them, too, and their lives will effectively be over if they aid and abet (which includes just funding them or becoming a 'member'). Granted, some 'normal' bigots will react negatively to this and become new die-hard extremists, but, again, they would have become die-hard extremists anyway one day of their own volition (these types of people are just waiting for *any* excuse to turn violent, imo, and trying to stop them today won't stop them in a few years if they're really that invested in hurting others). There are no really good answers to this problem, unfortunately, as you've mentioned, but I think we can both agree that *inaction* got us to this point in the first place and that doing nothing is probably the worst thing we can do. (I shall not try to get into the whole Free Speech Debate on this topic because I think it has been proven, unfortunately, that Free Speech is what led us to this moment specifically and the issue is way more complex and nuanced than I want to get into here on Reddit).

I appreciate your skepticism on this topic; that's indeed healthy to have, especially on a site like Reddit. However, you haven't given your *own* thoughts on this problem and the solutions for it yet. I'm curious to know if you have similar or different thoughts to what OP and I are discussing. You must have some as you asked for clarification on sources about deplatforming extremist members/movements.

So I'm proposing that we miss more minor breakthrough infections in the vaccinated than we miss reinfections in the previously infected but unvaccinated.

There's also an issue with drop off in protection from symptomatic infection.  Vaccination mostly happened 6 months ago.  Infections mostly happened 9 months ago.  So comparing the two as if that protection doesn't wane is going to give you an inaccurate picture.

* 28 bed ICU. Converting our cardiac telemetry unit to ICU beds and also using ED beds and Recovery Room beds as needed.  Displaced patients put in double rooms or ""new units"" in non-patient care areas. ED using hallway spaces for the less sick.
* Using travelers when available and non ICU nurses somewhat overseen by ICU nurses.  Needing to do a lot of just in time training (""what is a wake up and breath trial??"", haven't heard of many of our ICU meds).  
* Pulling our RTs out of their outpatient work and adding travelers where possible.
* Minimizing time Pulm/Crit docs are in the clinic, canceling non-essential vacations (currently some are truly essential), lots of extra shifts.  
* Expanding the roles of APPs. 
* Clinic staff and National Guard helping with less skilled tasks.
* Administration being very supportive, signing checks for cost overruns without much debate, and generally trying to stay out to the way of the busy bedside caregivers except when needed.

Nope, not at all. 

From the link: 

&gt; In June 2020, an employee tested positive. That sent Warner and his wife on their own hunt for a test.

&gt; Because of limited testing availability at the time, they drove 30 minutes from their home in Dallas to a free-standing emergency room in Lewisville, Texas. They received PCR diagnostic tests for the coronavirus, as well as rapid antigen tests.

&gt; When all their results came back negative, it was a huge relief, Warner says. He eagerly got back to work.

&gt; Then the bill came.

&gt; **The patient**: Travis Warner, 36, is self-employed and bought his health plan from Molina Healthcare via HealthCare.gov.

&gt; **Medical service**: Two ""COVID tests"" for the coronavirus — a diagnostic PCR test, which typically takes a few days to process and is quite accurate, and a rapid antigen test, which is less accurate but produces results in minutes.

&gt; **Total bill**: $56,384, including $54,000 for the PCR test and the balance for the antigen test and an ER facility fee. Molina's negotiated rate for both tests and the facility fee totaled $16,915.20, which the insurer paid in full.

&gt; **Service provider**: SignatureCare Emergency Center in Lewisville, one of more than a dozen free-standing ERs the company owns across Texas.

&gt; **What gives**: Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, stories of shockingly high prices for coronavirus tests have abounded. A recent report from an insurance trade association notes that ""price gouging by certain providers continues to be a widespread problem."" Warner's PCR bill of $54,000 was ""astronomical"" and ""egregious,"" according to health policy researchers we talked to. …

…

&gt; … While the policy was intended to help patients, health policy analysts say, it has unintentionally given health care providers leeway to charge arbitrary, sometimes absurd prices, knowing that insurers are required to pay and that patients, who won't be billed, are unlikely to complain.

&gt; ""People are going to charge what they think they can get away with,"" says Niall Brennan, president and CEO of the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit that studies health care prices. ""Even a perfectly well-intentioned provision like this can be hijacked by certain unscrupulous providers for nefarious purposes.""

&gt; A report from the Kaiser Family Foundation this year found that hospital charges for coronavirus tests ranged from $20 to $1,419 — not including physician or facility fees, which can often be higher than the cost of the tests themselves. About half the test charges were below $200, the report noted, but 1 in 5 were more than $300. …

…

&gt; … Medicare pays $100 for the test, and at-home tests are sold for as little as $24 for an antigen test or $119 for a PCR test.

&gt; Warner's charges were fully covered by his insurance.

&gt; But insurance policy premiums reflect how much is paid to providers. ""**If the insurance company is paying astronomical sums of money for your care, that means, in turn, that you are going to be paying higher premiums**,"" Adler says.

&gt; **Taxpayers, who subsidize marketplace insurance plans, also face a greater burden when premiums increase**. Even people who have employer-sponsored health coverage feel the pain. **Research shows that each increase of $1 in an employer's health costs is associated with a 52-cent cut to an employee's overall compensation.**",,,,1633017320,{},hev3pg9,False,t3_pyh8c8,False,True,t1_heugd23,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pyh8c8/the_bill_for_his_covid_test_in_texas_was_a/hev3pg9/,1633153219.0,13,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

They ban any claims that the vaccines are ineffective or are unsafe. Does that include legitimate claims made by scientists in peer reviewed papers? Would such a paper, were it to come out, be banned by that rule? What if the paper is controversial, and has some support from half of trustworthy scientists but no support from the other half? Who makes the call? Where’s the line?

Ultimately the definition of misinformation is decided by YouTube. You can’t make a sweeping claim about misinformation not being covered by the freedom of expression if the definition of misinformation is completely controlled by a private party!

Ultimately my argument is this: large platforms are the de facto public sphere of modern society.  Accordingly, as platforms grow, the standard for what content is allowed needs to approach the what is covered by the first amendment. YouTube is a large company, but they aren’t the only game in town. They should strive to allow as much speech as possible but not quite to the point covered by the first amendment.

Moreover, ignoring the irrational contrarians, there are rational, legitimately scientific reasons to be skeptical of a new type of vaccine that has not undergone full LT testing. That is not to say disinformation should be tolerated or go uncorrected, and clearly the known vaccine risks are low compared to COVID itself and are the key to getting us back to normalcy.

If you are vaccinated you are even less likely to be hospitalized. Hard to know the numbers since breakthrough cases are not being accurately counted.

With recommendations for a booster not even a year after being “fully vaccinated” it is akin to mandating the flu vaccine.

&gt;The agency, part of the World Health Organization, is negotiating with two other manufacturers and expecting to announce new deals soon, Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, its assistant director, said at a news conference Wednesday.

&gt;Sinovac has offered to sell 8.5 million doses this year and an additional 80 million in 2022, he said. Countries in the region that want the vaccine will have to buy it from the health organization.

&gt;”This is a purchase, it isn’t a donation,” Dr. Barbosa said, noting that the Inter-American Development Bank is offering loans to countries that need them.

&gt;The direct purchases begin at a time when, on average, only 35 percent of the population of Latin America and the Caribbean has been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, Dr. Carissa F. Etienne, the director of the agency, said, noting that the coverage has been very unequal.

&gt;The Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Games will take place in what organizers called a “closed-loop management system” — a bubblelike environment in which athletes, officials, broadcasters, journalists and a large Games work force will have to eat, sleep, work and compete without leaving, from the day they arrive to the moment they depart.

&gt;Anyone, including athletes, intending to enter this bubble has two choices: Arrive in China fully vaccinated or prepare to spend the first 21 days in Beijing in solitary quarantine.

&gt;And while spectators will be allowed to return to competition venues after being largely barred from the recent Summer Games in Tokyo, entry will be limited to those residing in mainland China.

&gt;The Summer Olympics in Tokyo featured a far more porous health protocol. Participants were not required to be vaccinated, nor sequestered if they were not, and while they were asked to try to remain within Games-affiliated venues, they were still afforded plenty of opportunities to interact with the outside world, including at convenience stores and local restaurants for takeout meals. Members of the local news media and the venue work forces in Tokyo, meanwhile, were allowed to commute to Olympic venues from their homes. And after a 14-day period of more harsh restrictions, all visitors to the Games were given the freedom to move about the city as they wished.

&gt;In England, the health system has a backlog of five million patients who are waiting for planned surgeries or treatment. And hundreds of thousands of patients have been waiting for at least a year, according to the National Health Service’s website.

&gt;To help ease that crunch, England’s hospitals are now relaxing restrictions that were put in place to deal with the pandemic, though some experts say that the measures cannot be effective unless the problem of acute staffing shortages is also addressed.

&gt;”Easing restrictions, like social distancing, may free up capacity in hospitals and alleviate some of the pressure,” said Katharina Hauk, a professor of health economics at Imperial College London. But with a sharp drop in hospital staffing numbers during the pandemic, she noted, “making room for more beds is not going to fix the problem if you don’t have the staff to look after the patients lying in these beds.”

&gt;The changes being introduced include reducing physical distancing from two meters to one meter in nonemergency departments, returning to regular cleaning procedures, and eliminating the requirement that patients must quarantine and get tested for Covid before receiving elective surgery.

&gt;Sajid Javid, the British health secretary, said that the country’s “phenomenal vaccination campaign” had made the changes possible.

&gt;Britain’s government announced this month a $7.3 billion package for the health service to try to deal with the soaring waiting lists and bolster the Covid response.

&gt;The decision this week to ease hospital restrictions is the latest in a series of moves by the government to return the country to prepandemic levels of normalcy. England lifted all but a few remaining Covid restrictions on July 19. The number of new cases has fluctuated since then.

&gt;The seven-day average of new daily coronavirus cases in Britain stood at 34,242 on Tuesday, a 6 percent rise compared with that figure two weeks previously, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Covid deaths have decreased by 4 percent in that period.

&gt;”We can now safely begin to relieve some of the most stringent infection control where they are no longer necessary to benefit patients and ease the burden on hard-working N.H.S. staff,” he said in a statement on the website of the U.K. Health Security Agency, which gives guidance on public health policy and security.

&gt;Different coronavirus rules can apply in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

&gt;As of Monday, about 82 percent of England’s population age 16 or older are fully inoculated against the coronavirus, and nearly 90 percent have received at least one vaccine dose, according to the N.H.S. website.",,,,1632963336,{},heslymt,True,t3_py8tu3,False,True,t3_py8tu3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/py8tu3/hospitals_in_england_relax_covid_rules_to_try_to/heslymt/,1633106452.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

It might not be a day or two worth of time, but an hour or two should not influence their mortality rate. 

As you mentioned limited beds, I understand how this can make things more difficult.  The thing is that many beds should not be needed in a small community since the population is be smaller.  With appropriate precautions, smaller populations, etc their positive rating should be much lower than urban areas. Yet it is not. The article states, “In 39 states, he added, rural counties had higher rates of Covid than their urban counterparts.”  The higher the positive rating the higher the death totals independent of hospitals.

[],,Sloth_Flyer,,,[],,,,text,t2_gklwa,False,False,[],"My argument hinges on what the actual policy is. The headline says, ""Youtube is ... blocking all anti-vaccine content.""

I originally interpreted this as ""Youtube is blocking all content that can be construed as anti-vaccine"" but it sounds like the actual policy is ""Youtube was already blocking misinformation about Covid vaccines, and now they are banning misinformation about all vaccines."" 

What is ""anti-vaccine content"" and what is just vaccine skepticism? Is a video titled ""Why I haven't gotten the vaccine"" where someone says ""I haven't gotten the vaccine because I don't trust the government"" vaccine skepticism or ""anti-vaccine content""? That's not misinformation or disinformation, it's just information - this person isn't spreading lies, after all - just explaining their feelings.

What about a video titled ""Why you shouldn't get the vaccine"" where someone says ""You shouldn't get the vaccine because you can't trust the government."" I would describe that as ""anti-vaccine content"" but I would not describe that as misinformation, either. Saying ""you can't trust the government"" is not a lie, it's not intended to deceive, it's just intended to persuade.

What about a video titled ""Lessons from history - why you shouldn't get the vaccine"" that talks about the Tuskegee experiment and uses that as their reason to not get the vaccine. It's clearly anti-vaccine content, but supposing the video contained only 100% vetted historical facts, would it be misinformation? I would say no.

You get the idea. Who gets to decide what misinformation is? I'm okay with Youtube decided to remove misinformation but I'm not okay with Youtube declaring that all anti-vaccine content is misinformation and therefore banned.

As for your points:

1) The article mentions ""misinformation"", not ""disinformation"".

2) Yes, yes, the dictionary declares that a business is different from a government. I'm talking about personal freedom \_as experienced by the individual\_, though. Imagine a world where your government enshrines free speech as a legal right, but most of your available modes of communication are owned and moderated by a single private monopoly who censors speech on their platforms. They deliver your mail so your mail is censored, they handle your internet so your internet is censored, your email is censored, your text messages are censored, and so on. As you write up a document in their word processor, it notices you writing up banned speech and quits and tells you to find a different word processor. Once you sort that out, your printer (also manufactured by them) refuses to print the document.

All you really have available to you is your voice and a pen and whatever is low tech enough to not be able to censor you. Would you say you have freedom of speech in this situation? Technically, perhaps you do. You can go to a public place and get on a bullhorn (provided they don't manufacture the bullhorn) and yell your speech. You'll reach maybe 100 people if you're lucky. No one is paying attention - all of the good, engaging content is online anyway. Technically you have freedom of speech because you won't be thrown in jail for voicing your opinion but effectively, you do not have freedom of speech. But according to your test (is it a company, no matter the size? great, then you have no rights to free speech on that company's platform!) there is no problem with this picture since it isn't the government that's censoring you.

Now, obviously this is just a fantasy pretend-world I made up. I'm not claiming that this is what's happening. I'm just using that made up example to illustrate the point that company size and market share \_does\_ matter and \_does\_ have an effect on your personal freedom. If some airline one day decided they wouldn't carry female passengers because the airline was owned by some religious wackjob, that company would go out of business fast. Competitors would eat it alive. But if it was the \_only\_ company, a monopoly, and they used their market power to keep things that way, then I guess tough shit if you're a woman. You need the government to step in and either break up the monopoly or regulate the airline and force them to be sane.

So yeah, company size \_does\_ matter. Monopoly power \_is\_ relevant to matters of free speech. And YouTube/Google isn't a monopoly, but they're pretty damn close. If the other big tech giants (FB, TikTok) follow YouTube's suit, that would account for 99%+ of all minutes watched on the web.

3) &gt; No government or company anywhere can be forced to let you do whatever you feel like, for any reason, anytime you like, wherever or whenever you please (see No. 2). Especially when your intent is to deceive/mislead (see No.1).

This is just patently false. If you live in the United States you have 1st amendment right to speech, even if you are lying. There are limits to that right, but it's completely false to claim that the ""government can't be forced to let you do what you like"".

Association Between K–12 School Mask Policies and School-Associated COVID-19 Outbreaks — Maricopa and Pima Counties, Arizona, July–August 2021

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

concluding paragraphs

Data were available for 1,020 of 1,041 (98.0%) K–12 public noncharter schools in Maricopa and Pima counties. Twenty-one (2.0%) schools had outbreaks reported &lt;7 days after school began and were excluded from the analyses. Among the 999 (96.0%) schools included in the analysis, 210 (21.0%) had an early mask requirement, 309 (30.9%) had a late mask requirement enacted a median of 15 days after school started (interquartile range = 9–17 days), and 480 (48.0%) had no mask requirement (Table). During July 15–August 31, 2021, 191 school-associated outbreaks occurred, 16 (8.4%) in schools with early mask requirements, 62 (32.5%) in schools with late mask requirements, and 113 (59.2%) in schools without a mask requirement.

In the crude analysis, the odds of a school-associated COVID-19 outbreak in schools with no mask requirement were 3.7 times higher than those in schools with an early mask requirement (odds ratio \[OR\] = 3.7; 95% CI = 2.2–6.5). After adjusting for potential described confounders, the odds of a school-associated COVID-19 outbreak in schools without a mask requirement were 3.5 times higher than those in schools with an early mask requirement (OR = 3.5; 95% CI = 1.8–6.9).

CDC recommends universal indoor masking in K–12 schools (1); however, masking requirements in K–12 schools vary by school district, county, and state. In the two largest Arizona counties, with variable K–12 school masking policies at the onset of the 2021–22 academic year, the odds of a school-associated COVID-19 outbreak were 3.5 times higher in schools with no mask requirement than in those with a mask requirement implemented at the time school started. Lapses in universal masking contribute to COVID-19 outbreaks in school settings (3); CDC K–12 school guidance recommends multiple prevention strategies. Given the high transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant, universal masking, in addition to vaccination of all eligible students, staff members, and faculty and implementation of other prevention measures, remains essential to COVID-19 prevention in K–12 settings (1).",,,,1633007103,{},heuged6,True,t3_pyjc96,False,False,t3_pyjc96,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pyjc96/association_between_kâ12_school_mask/heuged6/,1633141590.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;In 1777, smallpox was a big enough problem for the bedraggled American army that George Washington thought it could jeopardize the Revolution. An outbreak had already led to one American defeat, at the Battle of Quebec. To prevent more, Washington ordered immunizations — done quietly, so the British would not hear how many Americans were sick — for all troops who had not yet had the virus.

&gt;It worked. The number of smallpox cases plummeted, and Washington’s army survived a war of attrition against the world’s most powerful country. The immunization mandate, as Ron Chernow wrote in his 2010 Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Washington, “was as important as any military measure Washington adopted during the war.”

I'm pretty sure that even just the effect of vaccine waning has exceeded a 25% reduction. Anyone know if I missed any remark they made about that?   

Also worth noting that if you look at the graph of how current variants would compare to peak levels of winter 20-21, we already got quite a bit higher than their prediction, although they got the timing for the peak right.  

Some other things I thought interesting.. 

They predict that a variant that's 50% more transmissable would peak around 2.5 months after it hits 2000 cases, and a variant that's 25% more immune evasive would peak around 3 months after it hits 2000 population


But 2000 population is already a lot. If something grew at 50% population per week, it would be just under 5 months before it had a simultaneous population of 2000

Obviously contracting COVID is way worse of a risk,  so had she been in a profession with a lot of exposure to people the advice may have been different. As it were she works from home and limiting exposure risk was easy.

Here's a guide: First: Call your insurance (if you have it) and ask them: ""Where should I go to get treated for ex?"" They will give you suggestions as to where to go. 

Second: Call the places they suggested and ask if they take your insurance, and ask their procedures for your symptoms. 

Third: Be aware! Primary care is for physicals, standard injections, monitoring, and treatment of long-term manageable things like high blood pressure. 

Urgent Care is for when you cannot get an appointment with your primary doctor, for cuts, broken bones, flu, titers, injections for some things, like flu and tetanus, things that are not life-threatening. Urgent Care is not a place to go if you will need to be treated and monitored. If you go there with an emergent (needing emergency care) you will be referred to the ER. If you go there, but need a specialist, you will be referred to a specialist. You can avoid all of this by calling before you go, and asking. 

ER is for life- threatening things, like trouble breathing, heart issues, severe pain, bleeding, severely broken bones (where the bone is sticking out of the skin), overdoses, IVs for dehydration, etc. Hospitals have specialists on staff. If you get poked in the eye with a stick, they can get an eye specialist to fix it. If you have severely lacerated the muscles of you hand, they can get you a hand surgeon. If you are very ill, you can stay overnight for medicine and monitoring. You can't get that at Urgent Care - they go home every night. 

Virtual doctors are great for simple things that are easily treated and easy to diagnose without getting that hands-on presence. Toothaches, colds, minor things that can be cured with antibiotics, or simple medicines are perfect for this. 

But: the elderly and babies are the exception. Normal sicknesses in you and me are deadly for their delicate bodies. (A senior or baby can die of things that a healthy person could survive.) That is why your baby was referred to ER. 

Another thing: Waiting until the ""last minute"" is seen often at Urgent Care - people who wait and wait for care that could have been seen early on and treated by a regular primary doctor goes bad - and that's when people show up at Urgent Care, fearing the ER, and hoping to get away with *not* going to the ER. When things get too out of hand, like an infection that has gone septic - there's only one solution - the hospital - where you can get an IV antibiotic, the wound cleaned properly (possible surgery) and monitoring - to make sure you don't die. 

If you don't have insurance, and think you can't afford it, it's time to try. Obamacare will open up very soon. Go online and shop. See if they have something that fits you. If not, it may be time to call 211 to ask about special benefits thru Medicaid. Lots of people do this to get their kids medical care. You might qualify, too. 

And don't put off care till it's too late. Find help before things get really bad. If you need the ER, go. Don't wait. If you can't afford your bill, ask for a  ""Charitable Forgiveness"" form. This may forgive your entire bill, or pay most of it.",,,,1633000284,{},heu50gy,False,t3_py8oit,False,False,t1_hetl2ib,/r/Coronavirus/comments/py8oit/montana_hospital_icu_reaches_150_capacity_amid/heu50gy/,1633135844.0,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

So you’re saying the information from these viewpoints are only located on Reddit? So where did those people get their information?

See this is just another excuse for rabid stupidity lol 


&gt;For instance, the idea that covid was lab grown was banned on facebook, and the only stance allowed was that based on a paper written by the people who worked on developing novel coronaviruses. 

See if you educated yourself abs based what you believe in on facts you’d know that woman made up her two co researchers and everything she released was debunked by John Hopkins university. 

Not to mention she was paid by Steve Bannon and half of her “data” was from an unsourced blog owned by Bannon. 

&gt;I hope you can see how dangerous it is to assume that the appearance of factuality can be just that.

Oh I 100% agree that’s literally what you’ve done. And that’s the danger of letting that shit flow freely. You literally changed your stance not based on factual information but based on someone censoring misinformation. 

If you based your stance on factual information you wouldn’t be changing your mind. 

This is stupidity and ignorance all in one. 

&gt;It's not tho. It's just me bracing myself for the possible delusions that can arise in my brain as the result of things being artificially skewed so hard one way.

No this is stupidity. You’re literally claiming that because people are pushing the truth backed by scientific evidence that you’ve decided to believe the opposite in fear of a “delusion”. That’s the actual delusion. You’re criticizing your own thought process at this point. 

&gt;It's sort of like not just knowing about your biases, but knowing that you can't escape them and knowing that you have to deliberately compensate for them.

Then why don’t you shoot yourself in the face or take cyanide? I mean a LOT of people are claiming that will kill you. What if they are forcing a delusion on you and that’s actually the only way to “truly” live.

I am not arguing that YouTube broke any laws, i am arguing that YouTube (as a governing body) has a moral responsibility to uphold freedom of speech as a principle.

If YouTube was owned and operated by any state it would violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

In the end, how is it different if the outcome is the same?

It's literally a loophole that the UN did not consider that corporations would be so immensely powerful when drafting the human rights laws.

You say they do so by sticking to modern scientific theory. So does every video that analyzes trials and suggest that they might point away from previous conclusions held by a large portion of the scientific field  get thrown into the misinformation pile ?

 Your post also just incenuated that non-scientists  have the inability to accurately listen to scientific arguments and decide for themselves what is correct and incorrect.
 In that case, If they go the non algorithmic- route, how can a non expert in a field  accurately determine the validity and significance  of the information being presented? If they go the algorithmic- route, every video discussing information that could be in contention to current thinking could be pinged and removed.

Deplatforming is *IMPORTANT* in assuring that extremism will eventually die off slowly but surely by not reaching a broad audience, however the flipside is that the die-hard extremists will just become even more violent and entrenched feeling like they're being 'attacked, etc.' and might lead them to do even more horrific shit than they might have before being deplatformed.

However... just because they might be driven to more extreme measures *sooner* doesn't mean that they wouldn't have eventually gotten to that point eventually. People that are that die-hard usually look for any reason to lash out at others (or show they have a 'big dick' to other, like-minded bigots); hell, even if you don't given them a reason they'll invent one or shit-stir on their own.

It's pretty complicated, tbh, but if I were to choose which route I'd take --- deplatforming and killing off a huge chunk of 'new blood recruits' for the next fifty years or leaving them be and waiting for shit to hit the fan eventually --- I'd choose deplatforming. Both are likely to have the die-hards do violent and horrific shit, but at least deplatforming will hopefully have a chance to kill most of it off for a long, long time to come. I am not so naïve to think that deplatforming will kill extremism off completely (that is impossible), but there's truth in the thought that if you take away the platform and the future supporters for something, the 'movement' starts to die off after enough time has passed.

Sadly, deplatforming just isn't enough to stop misinformation or hatred from being spread among those in tight-knit groups that already are primed to believe whatever they read. There's no easy solution, but deplatforming is pretty much one of the easiest ones to do to try and control the problem for the next generation.

Hope the Sauce helps clarify the issue a bit:

 No one who was fully vaccinated developed severe Covid
 Study gives first insight on protection against delta variant

China’s inactivated vaccines maintained their protective power during a recent outbreak of Covid-19 in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, providing real world evidence about their ability to stave off the highly infectious delta variant. 

The immunizations from state-owned Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech Ltd. had a combined effectiveness of 70% against pneumonia caused by Covid and completely protected against severe disease caused by the delta variant, according to a pre-print study from researchers with the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The paper hasn’t yet been reviewed by outside experts. 

The paper tracked more than 10,000 people, including those infected and their close contacts during the outbreak that started in late-May and ended in mid-June. A total of 167 people contracted the virus. About one in eight of those in the study were fully vaccinated, mostly with shots from Sinopharm and Sinovac, and just over half were unvaccinated. The remainder had received at least one shot but came into close contact with someone who was infected before they had time to fully build up their immunity.",,,,1633013216,{},heutuue,False,t3_pfp8k0,False,True,t3_pfp8k0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pfp8k0/sinopharm_sinovac_shots_protective_in_guangdong/heutuue/,1633148322.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m shocked not every hospital has panic buttons.

Sadly, due to staff shortages we usually show up *after* the drug seeker has yelled at and attacked a nurse/doctor.

And people wonder why our ER has a metal detector at the entrance…

What makes thing especially dangerous for medical staff is they are distracted by trying to do a procedure or calm down and help the PT.

First, we don't have universal health care of any sort.  This means that hospitals need to expect that a certain percentage of people can't pay their bill, so they need to increase costs to cover for people who can't pay.  This in turn causes more people to be unable to pay, leading to more increased costs.

Second, hospitals set prices in such a way to force insurance companies to the negotiation table, under the assumption that insurance companies will pay most of it.  If a ibuprofen was to cost 10 cents, the insurance just pay that, but if they say it costs $30, that sets a price for negotiating over, while they bring it down to $5 or something.  Meanwhile, if you don't have insurance, you get charged $30 for the one pill

In short, it's the fact that most hospitals and medical providers operate on a for-profit system that assumes insurance will cover things, with insurance wanting to lower prices to make it look like they are doing something, combining in a perfect storm.

Here we go projecting again. I guess you think if you just throw around wild accusations one will stick eventually? Not taking this personally in the slightest. not even sure what there is to take personally here anyway. Im a bit amused by your bumbling through the topic though.

One doesn't \*need\* a philosophy degree to accuse someone of engaging with the core of the discussion but it certainly helps to make you look silly when you try to accuse \*me\* of acting in bad faith since again it doesn't seem you truly grasp the concept. 

\&gt;you refused to engage with the core of the discussion about censorship

Lmfao. Well first of all, I was not the original commenter in the discussion. I joined the discussion later to make a joke about what I bet was a contradiction in when and how they apply logic. Given the replies it seems I was correct but it was a tangential point and in reality I was under no obligation to make any other point because we weren't in the middle of the discussion. Ill humor you though and lets have a look at my original comment!

\&gt;This isn’t really true. There is no strictly unrestricted public alternative but there are numerous free alternatives on the internet. You aren’t entitled to the YouTube algorithm even if you are entitled to post your nonsense somewhere on the internet.

Well would ya look at that! I actually did engage with the censorship topic as well! Is reading difficult for you on a fundamental level as well?

\&gt;Despite your alleged intentions to the contrary, you did in fact derail the discussion by bringing up separate arguments and attacking the credibility of people instead of the argument itself.

Another typical redditor misapplication of ideas here. I just explained to you why I brought up the point. It really wasn't particularly deep. It also was \*not\* the premise to an argument. At no point did I say or imply that such an internal contradiction would invalidate the point. I just thought it would be funny to point out the cognitive dissonance.

\&gt;It’s a waste of time for others to engage with you since you won’t have a discussion on the merits of the topic at issue.

Which as you can see now is hilariously ironic given \*I\* actually did make a point on the main topic of the thread whereas \*you\* did not and instead... came in and miserably failed to ""derail the discussion by attacking the credibility of people (me) instead of the argument itself.""

Health care providers no longer are allowed to hold your information hostage to prevent you from leaving for example.

Now you may be looking at this and going ""What horrors are these?  This stuff shouldn't even be considered, never mind be thought of as a regulation"" and I agree with you, but when you are thinking in terms of ""Free Market"" it's highly regulated.  Just it's not competent regulation that would make things cheaper and easier for everyone, but it is better regulation than what we had before (where all those things I referenced were happening)",,,,1633027218,{},hevrmdy,False,t3_pyh8c8,False,True,t1_hevnrlq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pyh8c8/the_bill_for_his_covid_test_in_texas_was_a/hevrmdy/,1633164722.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

And not engaging with these systems, or learning more about them, because they've already discounted the medical field as ""not made for them"". 

In fact, [black communities expressed not only the greatest hesitancy to the vaccine, but also the most fear of getting covid](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cts.13077). People are aware that covid is deadly. A lot of them just also don't trust others to be able to safely fix the problem.

And, of course, there's structural issues where the push to get vaccines just isn't as high everywhere - People still might not know it's free, isnt experimental, and is FDA approved - or what that means. And it also might not be as widely available. I got mine at my local grocery store, but that doesn't mean that availability is everywhere.

I'm not saying that it's right, I'm just saying it's coming from a very different place than, say, the loud people with the pickup trucks and big flags and rude bumper stickers, and any hesitancy in black communities needs to be addressed with all these things in mind. 

Anyway, looking at [some of the newest stats](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/latest-data-on-covid-19-vaccinations-race-ethnicity/) it seems that in America the gap between black and white vaccination rates has lessoned with time.

&gt;Mayor Bill de Blasio had originally ordered well over 150,000 educators and staff in the nation’s largest school system to receive at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by tonight at midnight.

&gt;But on Monday evening, he said he would extend the deadline until the end of the day Friday, meaning that the mandate would take effect next Monday morning, Oct. 4.

&gt;The leaders of the unions representing city teachers and principals have spent the last week calling on the mayor to delay the deadline to give schools more time to prepare for potential staffing shortages caused by workers who refuse to get vaccinated.

&gt;The original deadline was put on hold late Friday by a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The three-judge panel was scheduled to take up the issue on Wednesday, but it appears to have ruled early.

&gt;The vaccine mandate for city educators and school staff has been upheld twice in state and federal courts in recent weeks. The Department of Education mandate is the first strict vaccine requirement for any group of city workers, and it could clear the path for a much broader mandate for all city employees in the coming weeks.

&gt;Mr. de Blasio said Monday that roughly 97 percent of principals and about 95 percent of teachers had been vaccinated, according to estimates from the city and unions representing teachers and principals, and that 87 percent of non-teaching school staff had received at least one shot. Roughly 8,000 Department of Education employees received a vaccination dose over the weekend in anticipation of the deadline.

&gt;The leaders of the unions representing the city’s teachers and principals have called on Mr. de Blasio to delay the implementation of the mandate, arguing that schools were not prepared to deal with staffing crunches.

&gt;Michael Mulgrew, the president of a powerful teachers’ union in the city, United Federation of Teachers, said in a statement that “the city has a lot of work before it to ensure that enough vaccinated staff will be available by the new deadline.”

&gt;The New York City Department of Education said in a statement that the court’s ruling “is on the right side of the law and will protect our students and staff.”

Obviously they are scared and sad and don't know how to properly process their emotions (my nephew has a habit of acting like he doesn't care about things so we don't think he's hurt or disappointed, which I think is what is happening here). I don't know how to help them through this, either way. I had my grandparents until high school, and I obviously never had a global pandemic disrupt my childhood.

First of all, if 17% of unvaccinated people make up 60% of the deaths that means that the 83% vaccinated population makes up 40%.

Imagine there is a population of 100 people, 83 vaccinated and 17 unvaccinated. 

Let’s say 10 of those people die from covid. 

6 of them unvaccinated and 4 of them vaccinated.

That means 6 of 17 unvaccinated people died from covid, which means the risk of an unvaccinated person dying from covid is 6/17 = **~35%.**

Only 4 of 83 vaccinated people died though. Which means the chances of a vaccinated perso.  dying from COVID = 4/83 = **~5%**

So these numbers alone indicate that vaccines offer **at least an ~85% reduction in risk of dying from covid**.

HOWEVER: There’s one major assumption here that’s not accounted for in these numbers, and it shows vaccines offer even *greater* protection.

The math above *assumes that the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations had equal risk of dying from covid before vaccinated*

However, we know that this is NOT true. 

We know that age is one of the biggest risk factors for covid. 

The vaccinated population is, on average, MUCH older than the unvaccinated population. 

People over the age of 65, the highest risk group, are something like 95% vaccinated in Israel, while the vast majority of unvaccinated people are in their twenties or thirties, one of the lowest risk groups. 

So the fact that this lower risk group accounts for 60% of deaths shows that the vaccines are working PHENOMENALLY. 

When you account for age, and compare vacccinated vs unvaccinated people of the same age, you find that **a vaccinated person is 90-95% less likely to die from covid than an unvaccinated person of the same age.** 

So TL;DR, the vaccines are working extremely well.",,,,1632964785,{},hesp1fd,False,t3_pxyl7k,False,True,t1_hesgd8k,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pxyl7k/covid_in_israel_the_17_unvaccinated_make_up_60_of/hesp1fd/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,6973a1275fe527efaeae887558954d899c4698a2,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1632964799.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

1) Who would decide the facts being taught in the syllabus? The feds? the state? the governor? The board of education?

The fact is people use YT for educational purposes, so if you claim education will solve the problem, wouldn't fake ""education"" on the same platform further aggravate the issue?  


2) Let's assume there was consensus among the states that and we could pass funding for education (which clearly will be blocked by the right),  how long do you think it would take to educate the kids? Also how do you propose educating adults who are propagating the misinformation that they source from FB/Youtube?  We've already lost 700,000 lives,  how long do you think this education effort would last to finally see results? How many lives would you be ok with losing during this time?

The core issue right now is that we know that people are refusing vaccines based on disinformation shared online. If a large segment of the population was truly rational, we wouldn't have such a low vaccination rate given the fact that we got first dibs on the vaccine supply.  Since we've identified the problem, it's important we take immediate steps to stem the source of the lies - which is why YT is doing the right thing.

I admit, most of them aren't the young bucks fresh out of medical school. However, the only reason they are staying is because hospitals in larger areas tend to pay more and they have massive amounts of debt from school. It's never too late to create a public option and fund it well. Increased wages would create more incentive for doctors to work in these more rural areas as well as encourage more people to enter the medical profession.

So I disagree, forcing doctors to work in these areas is not the only solution. Instead, we could spend less on tanks and more on education and public health. We wouldn't need to raise taxes and the national defense wouldn't even take a hit. All we would need to do is vote for politicians who care more about their constituents than their large donors. Then we could effectively use collective bargaining to reduce the cost of the defense budget without sacrificing production or wages and spend that money on the people.

Anyways, the point is no. Whereas a decreased access to medical facilities may be a small factor, as u/brettlewisn said, it is not the main reason for the larger death rate.

The impact of overlapping risk factors on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severity is unclear. To evaluate the impact of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity on COVID-19 severity, we conducted a cohort study with 28,095 anonymized COVID-19 patients using data from the COVID-19 Research Database from January 1, 2020 to November 30, 2020. The mean age was 50.8 ± 17.5 years, and 11,802 (42%) patients were male. Data on age, race, sex, T2D complications, antidiabetic medication prescription, and body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2 (obesity) were analysed using Cox proportional hazard models, with hospitalization risk and critical care within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis as the main outcomes. The risk scores were 0–4 for age ≥ 65 years, male sex, T2D, and obesity. Among the participants, 11,294 (61.9%) had obesity, and 4445 (15.8%) had T2D. T2D, obesity, and male sex were significantly associated with COVID-19 hospitalization risk. Regarding hospitalization risk scores, compared with those for hospitalization risk score 0 and critical care risk score 0, hazard ratios \[95% confidence intervals\] were 19.034 \[10.470–34.600\] and 55.803 \[12.761–244.015\] (P &lt; 0.001) (P &lt; 0.001), respectively, for risk score 4.

[https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/epi/covid-19-myocarditis-pericarditis-vaccines-epi.pdf?sc\_lang=en](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/epi/covid-19-myocarditis-pericarditis-vaccines-epi.pdf?sc_lang=en)

That gives far more data than the article.  If you look at table A2, you can see the actual reports and vaccine doses administered for Moderna.  The 1/5000 number comes from the 18-24 male range where there were 44 reports of myocarditis/pericarditis for 167,198 doses administered (or optionally Table B2 where the numbers are restricted from june to august: 8 reports for 40,921 doses).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Reports of myocarditis or pericarditis included in this report are those that have a:  
&gt;  
&gt;Diagnosis of myocarditis and meeting Brighton Collaboration level of diagnostic certainty 1 to 3 for myocarditis OR  
&gt;  
&gt;Diagnosis of pericarditis and meeting the Brighton Collaboration level of diagnostic certainty 1 to 3 for pericarditis OR  
&gt;  
&gt;Diagnosis of myopericarditis or perimyocarditis and meeting either the Brighton Collaboration levels 1 to 3 for myocarditis or pericarditis

&amp;#x200B;

For reference I actually went back and looked at case definitions from the Brighton Collaboration:

&amp;#x200B;

|Case Level|Definition|
|:-|:-|
|Level 1|definitive case|
|Level 2|probable case|
|Level 3|possible case|

​ [https://brightoncollaboration.us/myocarditis-case-definition-update/](https://brightoncollaboration.us/myocarditis-case-definition-update/) ​

So if I'm reading this correctly, they are including all diagnoses including possible cases in their numbers.  I don't know what level of certainty that implies, though they do report that the majority (across all age ranges and vaccines) resulted in in-patient hospitalization (but only 3 resulted in an ICU visit).",,,,1633007908,{},heui0nk,False,t3_py2xfx,False,True,t3_py2xfx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/py2xfx/ontario_recommends_people_aged_18_to_24_take/heui0nk/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,df2c24c80ae6d587500dbe543f2b858db0169bef,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1633007923.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Background  
Long-COVID refers to a variety of symptoms affecting different organs reported by people following Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. To date, there have been no robust estimates of the incidence and co-occurrence of long-COVID features, their relationship to age, sex, or severity of infection, and the extent to which they are specific to COVID-19. The aim of this study is to address these issues.  
  
Methods and findings  
We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on linked electronic health records (EHRs) data from 81 million patients including 273,618 COVID-19 survivors. The incidence and co-occurrence within 6 months and in the 3 to 6 months after COVID-19 diagnosis were calculated for 9 core features of long-COVID (breathing difficulties/breathlessness, fatigue/malaise, chest/throat pain, headache, abdominal symptoms, myalgia, other pain, cognitive symptoms, and anxiety/depression). Their co-occurrence network was also analyzed. Comparison with a propensity score–matched cohort of patients diagnosed with influenza during the same time period was achieved using Kaplan–Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazard model. The incidence of atopic dermatitis was used as a negative control.  
  
Among COVID-19 survivors (mean \[SD\] age: 46.3 \[19.8\], 55.6% female), 57.00% had one or more long-COVID feature recorded during the whole 6-month period (i.e., including the acute phase), and 36.55% between 3 and 6 months. The incidence of each feature was: abnormal breathing (18.71% in the 1- to 180-day period; 7.94% in the 90- to180-day period), fatigue/malaise (12.82%; 5.87%), chest/throat pain (12.60%; 5.71%), headache (8.67%; 4.63%), other pain (11.60%; 7.19%), abdominal symptoms (15.58%; 8.29%), myalgia (3.24%; 1.54%), cognitive symptoms (7.88%; 3.95%), and anxiety/depression (22.82%; 15.49%). All 9 features were more frequently reported after COVID-19 than after influenza (with an overall excess incidence of 16.60% and hazard ratios between 1.44 and 2.04, all p &lt; 0.001), co-occurred more commonly, and formed a more interconnected network. Significant differences in incidence and co-occurrence were associated with sex, age, and illness severity. Besides the limitations inherent to EHR data, limitations of this study include that (i) the findings do not generalize to patients who have had COVID-19 but were not diagnosed, nor to patients who do not seek or receive medical attention when experiencing symptoms of long-COVID; (ii) the findings say nothing about the persistence of the clinical features; and (iii) the difference between cohorts might be affected by one cohort seeking or receiving more medical attention for their symptoms.  
  
Conclusions  
Long-COVID clinical features occurred and co-occurred frequently and showed some specificity to COVID-19, though they were also observed after influenza. Different long-COVID clinical profiles were observed based on demographics and illness severity.  
  
Author summary  
Why was this study done?  
Long-COVID has been described in recent studies. But we do not know the risk of developing features of this condition and how it is affected by factors such as age, sex, or severity of infection.  
We do not know if the risk of having features of long-COVID is more likely after Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) than after influenza.  
We do not know about the extent to which different features of long-COVID co-occur.  
What did the researchers do and find?  
This research used data from electronic health records of 273,618 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and estimated the risk of having long-COVID features in the 6 months after a diagnosis of COVID-19. It compared the risk of long-COVID features in different groups within the population and also compared the risk to that after influenza.  
The research found that over 1 in 3 patients had one or more features of long-COVID recorded between 3 and 6 months after a diagnosis of COVID-19. This was significantly higher than after influenza.  
For 2 in 5 of the patients who had long-COVID features in the 3- to 6-month period, they had no record of any such feature in the previous 3 months.  
The risk of long-COVID features was higher in patients who had more severe COVID-19 illness, and slightly higher among females and young adults. White and non-white patients were equally affected.  
What do these findings mean?  
Knowing the risk of long-COVID features helps in planning the relevant healthcare service provision.  
The fact that the risk is higher after COVID-19 than after influenza suggests that their origin might, in part, directly involve infection with SARS-CoV-2 and is not just a general consequence of viral infection. This might help in developing effective treatments against long-COVID.  
The findings in the subgroups, and the fact that the majority of patients who have features of long-COVID in the 3- to 6-month period already had symptoms in the first 3 months, may help in identifying those at greatest risk.",,,,1633004990,{},heucfts,True,t3_pyir4f,False,False,t3_pyir4f,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pyir4f/incidence_cooccurrence_and_evolution_of_longcovid/heucfts/,1633139585.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plenty of studies (and a basic understanding of the immune system) suggest that a previous infection is at least somewhat effective.

That's absolutely correct, a previous infection does give a level of immunity. My criticism is that for the people who chose to forego the vaccines, many think that the natural immunity will protect them in the future, forever, which is absolutely not true. The russian roulette of getting covid infection, year after year, won't be as innocuous as they think.

What’s frustrating to me, is your inability to comprehend basic science and instead make this a matter of policy.

What’s frustrating to me, is that there seems to be an opinion that freedoms mean the stuff I want or I like.  As you pointed out eloquently, the USA is a land of different views and values.

What’s frustrating to me is your discussion on freedoms that align only to your views and values.  

What’s frustrating to me is your discussion of world views while also showing how narrow that view for you is.  Trying to discuss the USA and freedoms as if this is a single country dealing with the current state.


All of the above are opinions and up for debate.  

However here are the facts:

You not getting vaccinated risks the health of the community.  

The community is larger than you or your “personal” freedoms.  This community spans farther than the US or your perceived freedoms.  

The community is the human race.

Your selfish acts risk that and unfortunately that comprehension has been warped for you by opinion and not facts.

Vaccines save lives, full stop.

To conclude-

You’ve made a choice.  However, choices are a matter of opinion.  We don’t agree on that choice and just like above we can agree to disagree

You’re free to make choices, unfortunately for you in this case, so is everyone else.  Collectively, the community (globally) has chosen to ostracize those who’ve made the same choice as you

They’ve done this for the communities freedom(not just the USA) to interact without fear of a rapidly transferable virus that’s killed millions.  That is being consistently transmitted thru vectors unwillingly to be part of the community due to selfish perceived freedoms.

Sometimes, uneducated choices have consequences.

So if you find yourself getting upset about that, just remember…that’s those freedoms you love so much, the ones that EVERYONE gets.

Finally,  I chose to ignore your whataboutism about a variety of other health issues. That’s my choice :)

You could argue that the above curtailment of freedom will lead to an authoritarian regime but we have been living with those rules for a while and we are fine. Modern societies live somewhere between ""absolute individual freedom"" and ""total state control"". No society can exist in either extreme.    


I can imagine that 100 years ago, owners of this new technology called the automobile started by being able to go wherever, whenever, however. But as accidents and deaths happened, we decided that we needed a rule system to manage that freedom in a way it lessened the burden on society. Thus your freedom is not absolute when you drive a car, there are a ton of restrictions. Traffic rules aim at streaking a balance between your individual freedom and your society obligations.  Hopefully those red lights or stop signs are a small price to pay.  
I think that, similarly, we start now with this new technology called social media with total freedom, write whatever, however. As we see the consequences of that absolute freedom, we will decide that we need some rule system to manage that freedom in a way it lessens the burden on society.  Yes, our freedom will not be absolute anymore and it may need multiple revisions but I think we again will streak a balance between individual freedom and society obligations.  


In short, if you do not feel under authoritarian rule when you stop for a red light, you should not feel you are when you face whatever constraint we will put on social media. Of course, we should aim at trying to maximize social benefit but minimize impact on our individual freedom.

&gt;The scientists reported that the patient, age 77, experienced insomnia and anxiety while infected with the virus and, several weeks after discharge, began to experience restless, deep anal discomfort.

&gt;The patient experienced an urge to move which worsened with rest and improved with exercise and worsened in the evening in the anal region. A colonoscopy revealed internal hemorrhoids. 

&gt;While it is still unclear how COVID-19 causes neurological symptoms, a number of cases of neurological issues, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, ""brain fog"" and tingling among other issues, have been linked to coronavirus infections since the start of the pandemic.

&gt;Restless anal syndrome is a variant of restless leg syndrome (RLS), which has also been linked to a small number of COVID-19 cases. This is the first case report to link restless anal syndrome to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

&gt;The 77-year-old patient, categorized as a mild COVID-19 case, was admitted to Tokyo Medical University Hospital with a sore throat, cough and low-grade fever and treated for mild pneumonia, insomnia and anxiety. Although his respiratory function returned to normal 21 days after he was admitted, insomnia and anxiety remained.

&gt;Several weeks after discharge, he began to experience anal discomfort despite never experiencing such discomfort before he was affected by COVID-19. Exercise relieved his symptoms while resting worsened them. 

&gt;The scientists diagnosed the patient with restless anal syndrome after determining that his symptoms matched the criteria and failing to observe any other cause for the syndrome. No bladder or rectal disturbance or erectile dysfunction was found in the patient. Neurological tests found no abnormalities and the patient had no family history of RLS or periodic limb movements.

&gt;The patient's symptoms were alleviated after being treated every day with 1.5 mg of Clonazepam, a medication used to treat seizure disorders and panic disorders.

&gt;The scientists stressed that the long-term neuropsychiatric effects of COVID-19 are not yet fully understood and it is still unclear how the novel coronavirus causes these effects. They called for long-term monitoring of such effects in order to gain a fuller understanding of the mechanisms behind them, adding that COVID-19-related RLS or RLS variants may be underdiagnosed.

&gt;Since the middle of last year, researchers have found that even some patients who were only mildly affected by the virus suffered neurological complications ranging from brain inflammation and delirium to nerve damage and stroke.",,,,1633022383,{},hevg03z,True,t3_pyodqe,False,False,t3_pyodqe,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pyodqe/covid_may_cause_restless_anal_syndrome/hevg03z/,1633159152.0,148,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

About case numbers blowing up everywhere including small communities when what they have done is move thousands of patients from big cities into small town hospitals and count those cases as locally in both areas, telling me this new mRNA technology is completely safe when we have zero long term data on potential long term consequences, I could go on) is going to sway my view, it's really not going to because they have already lost my trust when I found out I was being lied to. Why would they need to lie to me if it was so scary?  Of course a tiny percentage of people are going to die from it. Same as any sickness, not everybody is equal 

I'm double vaccinated, and now I'm hearing about calls to start pumping this stuff into prepubescent kids? How disgustingly selfish are these particular cult members to even take a tiny risk of their kids having adverse affects down the road so that the parent might be spared from getting sick for a few days?

&gt; Firstly, it is important to know that the “real-time” estimate of R_t  (e.g. an estimate of R_t) for today, based on data reported today) is very uncertain. This is because the data we have to estimate R_t (daily diagnoses and deaths, as reported by each county and state) are lagged relative to transmission. Today’s reported diagnoses have resulted from transmissions that happened 1-2 weeks ago on average, and today’s reported COVID-19 deaths relate to transmission that happened even further in the past. While we assume that R_t is unlikely to change abruptly, we have very little evidence on what R_t is today. This will be true of all estimation approaches that make use of conventional surveillance data. This uncertainty can be seen in the wide credible intervals for R_t shown in our state-level results (in the figure below, the left panel shows the most recent R_t estimates for Arizona on September 26th). By a traditional interpretation of our 95% intervals, we believe there is a 1-in-20 chance that the true value of R_t is outside the interval on any given day. While we don’t show intervals for the county-level results, the uncertainty in R_t is revealed by the sometimes major revisions in R_t that can be seen in the country-level results (figure below, right panel). Even if the most recent point estimate for R_t is above 1.0, it could be revised to a value below 1.0 when more data come in, and vice-versa.

[],,dropletPhysicsDude,,,[],,,,text,t2_5jj7vtrh,False,False,,"I hoped so too.  I think the biggest problem is that some of the MIQ hotels they used weren't modified enough to prevent airborne spread and it leaked through.  I've talked to a few friends who moved back to NZ recently and went through the process and there were a couple obvious gaps in the setup.  Similar thing in Australia.  They had problems with leaks even before Delta but Delta is just to much to put the genie back in the bottle.  


Overall, I'd chalk both quarantine leaks (and the ones in China, which they seem to have been able to contain after leaks) up to a continued fallout from the medical orthodoxy refusal to recognize airborne spread as a major mode of transmission for many infectious diseases.  This creates a general failure to understand airborne spread amongst the whole chain of policy makers and even when they finally acknowledge it with Covid, there isn't a ""deep bench"" of expertise to execute an effective quarantine.

We live with my elderly grandparents that both have kidney disease, heart disease, and one has diabetes. I have poorly controlled stage 2 high blood pressure and asthma. We're all vaccinated but I'm frankly terrified of her stepping foot in this house. What should we do? I would like for her to quarantine elsewhere and have a negative PCR test a few days after returning. If I can't find another place for her to stay, I was considering telling her she needs to be masked 100% of the time, not leave the basement apartment, and eat outside.
