An unexpected change in the course of SARS-CoV-2

So all of a sudden, it looked like SARS-CoV-2 not only was mutating but was doing so quite rapidly. Last month, Kistler and her colleagues at the University of Washington published a new metric to measure how quickly SARS-CoV-2 is evolving as it adapts to living inside humans. When Kistler first saw the value, she was shocked. “SARS-CoV-2’s rate of adaptation is remarkably high right now,” she says, “like roughly four times higher for SARS-CoV-2 than it is for seasonal flu.”

Remember, the flu changes so fast that people can be vulnerable to it each year.

“I don’t think SARS-CoV-2 will stop adapting,” Kistler says. “It may slow down, but viruses that evolve adaptively tend to keep doing that. They don’t tend to hit the limit of evolution.”",,,,1635814491,{},hiyemt2,False,t3_qk1465,False,True,t3_qk1465,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qk1465/covids_endgame_scientists_have_a_clue_about_where/hiyemt2/,1636023087.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether it's a 10% reduction or a 50% reduction, I think all of it has an impact on something that grows exponentially. It's hard to ultimately quantify what all of this does, so it's really easy for people to say screw it. The same was said with masks earlier. It's almost like we at Reddit love labeling things as TSA security theater when we get the chance... but see how we backtracked on that later. The same with masks protecting only others. It took a few months, but then the science became clear that masks have SOME protective qualities.

The way I see it is the people who took COVID the most seriously ended up with the least problems. It doesn't mean you always have to focus only on the best solutions. China and many other Asian countries engaged in a lot of this security theater including mass spraying and sanitizing of roads, sidewalks, etc. But to me it's a mindset. Some of it might be useless or only have a small impact, but if you're willing to go all out whether it was lockdowns, mask wearing, sanitizing, testing, etc. then it shows you're willing to get the job done.

Here on Reddit and actually in a good portion of America, I see people being hyper focused on highlighting things that DON'T work. Masks were a great example, but also this and temperature scans. The net result is that if something doesn't overwhelmingly prevent COVID, then we treat it like the dumbest idea ever. This kind of ridiculing of safety measures is really how we got here with a portion of the population that's still anti mask and anti vaccine.

&gt;The directive by the commerce ministry stirred some concern on domestic social media that it may have been triggered by heightened tensions with Taiwan.

&gt;In response, the Economic Daily, a Communist Party-backed newspaper, told netizens not to have ""too much of an overactive imagination"" and that the directive's purpose was to make sure citizens were not caught off guard if there was a lockdown in their area.

&gt;The ministry's statement late on Monday urged local authorities to do a good job in ensuring supply and stable prices, and to give early warnings of any supply problems.

As someone from Singapore, I have to clarify that our number of imported cases (be it through the Vaccinated Travel Lane or otherwise) is currently extremely low, as compared to the \~3k+ community cases we see on a daily basis since September. All fully vaccinated international arrivals who may be exempted from quarantine still have to take one or two PCR tests upon arrival, so I wouldn't say that the current surge is due to comparatively lenient border controls.

 Instead, I would attribute the differences between Japan and Singapore to the following:

Although 84% of the vaccine-eligible population has completed the full vaccine regimen (mainly Pfizer/Moderna), the country has not seen large waves of infections and deaths prior to the vaccination programme and subsequent reopening due to our previous Covid-zero approach. (The previous ""wave"" in April-June 2020 was mostly contained in foreign worker dormitories.) As such, the vast majority of the country is still relatively ""Covid-naive"". 

Meanwhile, the reopening between June-August was already nearly six months after the elderly were asked to get their vaccines (February-April). We know that the antibodies obtained from vaccination may decrease over time, so the badly timed reopening did affect quite a number of the elderly, who had a higher chance of becoming severely ill or dying due to multiple co-morbidities (e.g. advanced age, long-term illnesses). Breakthrough Covid infections have also struck quite a number of families, and those who are unable to set aside a spare room for Covid-positive patients to self-isolate at home are disproportionately affected by the Home Recovery Programme due to living in close quarters.",,,,1635833812,{},hizd913,False,t3_qkbc3q,False,True,t1_hiwlxdk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qkbc3q/tokyo_logs_9_daily_covid_cases_fewest_since_may/hizd913/,1636043068.0,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction  
A total of 34 U.S. state governments imposed moratoria on water shutoffs between March and May 2020 to ensure equitable access to water during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, by the end of 2020, most of these moratoria had expired, and millions of people were exposed to the risk of water disconnections. This study examines the linkage between water equity and public health and provides policy recommendations for improving water access and health equity.  
Methods  
Event study was used to analyze the impact of a water shutoff moratorium on COVID-19 daily infection growth rate and daily death growth rate from April 17, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The data were collected at the state level. The model controlled for mask mandates, at-risk groups (percentage Hispanic population, percentage essential workers), and percentage health insurance coverage.  
Results  
During the study period, having a water shutoff moratorium in place significantly lowered the COVID-19 infection daily growth rate by 0.235% and significantly lowered the death growth rate by 0.135%. In addition, a comprehensive moratorium covering all water systems (public and private) significantly lowered the infection growth rate by 0.169% and significantly lowered the death growth rate by 0.228%.  
Conclusions  
This study raises attention to the importance of water equity and the need for government actions to create more uniform protections from water shutoffs across all states. A comprehensive approach to water equity can protect the health and safety of all communities.",,,,1635857991,{},hj08beb,True,t3_ql3ms6,False,False,t3_ql3ms6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ql3ms6/water_shutoff_moratoria_lowered_covid19_infection/hj08beb/,1636061855.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In America only bad people wear masks. People who rob banks, stagecoaches or trains cover their nose and mouth. If you do that you're treated with suspicion and fear. In SE Asia there's more of an ethic of humility and shyness and wearing a mask is kind of a universal ""please leave me alone"" signal that people respect in kind. In America it stirs something deep in us that's visceral going beyond logic and reason. People here who are anti-mask don't consciously know why they fear masks so they make up ""freedom"" arguments and the others in lieu of whatever deeper subconscious shit they can't voice.

A parent can't read this and come up with almost anything that they can actually do to keep their kids from getting infected.  Schools require kids to be crammed together without masks at times like lunch and can't redo their ventilation systems.  The CDC's first bullet point is also stating that it's of the utmost importance for kids to be face to face in school, and all COVID mitigation efforts come second purely based on priority.  They also use a lot of weasel words like ""should"" because they know that they aren't able to actually require anything, so most states ignore some or all of the guidelines the CDC publishes.

Nah I didn't, it got removed. Very frustrating. I mean you spend some time writing a post that is polite, not controversial in the least and yet it gets deleted. Basically what I wrote was that I wasn't vaccinated, that elderly and people at risk should vaccinate. I also wrote that I didn't live in an echo chamber and that my experience was that a lot of relatives and friends who did get vaccinated had a lot of misconceptions (how long vaccination immunity would last, that Covid would get eradicated if people vaccinated etc). That my subjective experience was that those who didn't get the shot seemed to be following the news more closely.

Hardly controversial stuff. Perhaps this conversation will be allowed to not get deleted but I mean it's burrowed by now under deleted posts so hidden from view pretty much.

The challenge is to prevent it coming back in.  That has not been tried.  A few residents on coastal islands off New Jersey tried sealing off in 2020 but without government support.  

The protocols for mass testing are completely foreign to American society.  As far as I know it is not done.  When the goal is to simply verify ""no one in this entire group has covid"" the price per sterile swab is only about $0.20.  Think of ""every person entering a workplace"" or ""every person entering a store"", or ""everyone who came to this church on Sunday"".  When there is a small number of asymptomatic people it fairly easy narrow down who it could be.  Regardless of finding the carrier when you are in the groups that are fully negative you can relax. 

Airplanes are fairly easy.  Swab everyone before boarding.  The airlines will not like this because it does not reassure any travelers.  The test protects the destination city.  There will be plane loads of angry passengers when they get quarantined. 

Motor vehicles will be much more difficult to swab.  It will be highly disruptive to traffic like a toll station.  Commercial traffic and commuters would just test weekly until both of sides of a border were clear.  

Some technologies like sewer sampling sensors could facilitate rapid response when covid19 slips through.

Sadly, one employee snapped and couldn’t handle the preassure of getting complaints from customers who dont want to wear a mask, demand close customer service, and a million other nonsensical covid reasons.
- This employee is immune compromised.

On the same day, an anti-vax/masker thought it would be a good idea to joke about an employee who is still social distancing, calling them weird, paranoid, should be fired, demand better customer service, etc. Sadly they were joking about this to a manager (me). My only response is, they are doing their job to keep themselves safe. The anti-vax did not like that stating it is the employees fault for being a paranoid baby towards a person who is fully vaccinated so dont need a mask.

I just responded back with something along the lines of this “ A person who has a severely weakened immune system who has a higher chance of contracting and dieing from covid-19. Should put themselves in the hand’s of a stranger who essentially says ’ Trust me im vaccinated ‘ without the garuntee of being safe. Doing anything to keep them selves safe like social distancing is a fireable offense because YOU dont get the interaction YOU want.

&gt;A new study of hundreds of white-tailed deer infected with the coronavirus in Iowa has found that the animals probably are contracting the virus from humans, and then rapidly spreading it among one another, according to researchers.

&gt;Up to 80 percent of deer sampled from April 2020 through January 2021 in the state were infected, the study indicated.

&gt;Scientists said the findings pose worrisome implications for the spread of the coronavirus, although they were not able to identify how the deer might have contracted the virus from humans. There is no evidence that deer have passed the virus back to humans.

&gt;Researchers and outside experts characterized the study’s findings as a troubling development in the course of the pandemic. Widespread infection among North America’s most ubiquitous game species could make eradicating the pathogen even more difficult, especially if they became a reservoir for mutations that eventually spilled back over to humans.

Dude, you don't *give yourself a condition* in order to lower the chances of getting that condition later.  That's just idiotic.

And decapitation is a nice, colorful way of illustrating that.  More importantly, it was chosen because, unlike with your natural COVID immunity, decapitation actually reduces your chances of ""reinfection"" to 0%.  So, the analogy shows why the most optimistic wishful thinking of those pushing natural immunity as superior is still nonsense.

I could put it in mathematical terms.

The expectation of a random variable is a sort of ""average outcome"" for that variable.  Formally, it's integral x*p(x) dx or sum x*p(x), so it's the value of the variable times the probability of getting that value, summed or integrated depending on whether it's continuous or discrete.

For example, if I'm a baseball team, and I have a 20% chance to score 0 runs, a 20% chance to score 1 run, a 20% chance to score 2 runs, up to 4 runs (this isn't how baseball runs are distributed, but I'm giving it a simple distribution to make it easy to illustrate), then the expectation value for a game is .2*0 + .2*1 + .2*2 + .2*3 + .2*4 = 2 runs.  If I played 100 games, I'd get on average 2 runs per game, so I'd expect to get close to 200 runs total.  Expectation values are very useful for looking at random variables with lots of draws.

The expectation value for serious COVID cases among vaccinated people is less than 1.  (This is a reasonable assumption, given every damned study of the vaccines we have.)

Suppose ""natural immunity"" confers perfect protection from the disease (it doesn't, but pretend it does).

The expectation value is *exactly 1* in that case!  (And the symptoms are worse, because you're unvaccinated.)

Mathematically, this is exactly the same as the decapitation example.  People who don't cut off their own heads can expect the number of decapitations in their lives to be less than 1.  People who *do* chop off their own heads get a very certain number, 1 decapitation.  And that one fits, exactly, the *best case scenario* for natural immunity.

And it's still not worth it.

And then the reality is that the expectation value for COVID cases via natural immunity is greater than 1, whereas it's less than 1 for vaccines.

Very simple math.",,,,1635821163,{},hiyt370,False,t3_qk0gwo,False,True,t1_hiwvct2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qk0gwo/psaki_tests_positive_for_covid_last_saw_biden/hiyt370/,1636030904.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But there's many non-tech solutions that would make people's everyday lives better too. Universal paid sick time, for example, would help many young people avoid going to work at places like restaurants where they're sometimes serving elderly. Having a stronger culture that looks down on coming into work sick instead of celebrating it as a sign of ""hard work"" or ""dedication"". And fostering a culture where people at least wear a mask personally when they're feeling sick and have to go out would help protect others without it being something everyone has to do.

&gt;About 17% of children in Alabama’s residential foster care facilities have received a first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, compared to 37% of eligible youth statewide, according to data obtained from the Department of Human Resources.

&gt;The May memo states that the group of legal or designated representatives responsible for determining a child’s services, known as ISP teams, must meet to discuss the recommendations of the child’s pediatrician and come to a decision about their vaccination.

&gt;However, DHR’s existing medical consent policy, which reflects state law, allows adolescents to consent to the treatment of a reportable disease, regardless of age, without the consent of anyone else.

&gt;“It would be a pain to pull together an ISP team,” said Christy Johnson, investigator supervisor at ADAP. “They don’t meet very frequently, so that would be a hurdle to vaccination.”

&gt;“If a kid needs to have his appendix taken out, it doesn’t have to go to an ISP team,” said Nancy Anderson, associate director of ADAP. “If he needs braces or he needs to go for a physical, all of those things are the responsibility of DHR.

If a burglar wanted to rob your house he would not expect your door to be unlocked.  He will come either prepared to pick your door lock, or prepared to enter your house through some other means. So although locking your door gives you some peace of mind, it is no real protection from a determined burglar. That is the definition of security theater.

I'm sorry that folks are getting worked up about this, but I neither invented the concept nor am I trying to sell the concept. I'm just passing along the definition of a well understood psychological phenomenon.  People want to feel safe. They don't necessarily need to be safe.

I don't know if there might be some Asian studies that haven't really filtered into the English speaking world yet or something, but I'm not aware of any convincing evidence that AY.23 is actually worse than regular Delta. 

The prevalence of AY.23 and subsequently AY.23.1 in Singapore makes for a pretty odd graph, but these variants haven't been able to really demonstrate a growth advantage in any country that has a well developed Delta wave already, as far as I can see.   
Malaysia's graph doesn't convince me there's an advantage for AY.23 either.

This study investigates the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival secretions and tears and evaluates ocular symptoms in a group of patients with COVID-19. We included 56 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in this cross-sectional cohort study. Conjunctival secretions and tears were collected using flocked swabs and Schirmer strips for SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Assessment of ocular surface manifestations included an OSDI (Ocular Surface Disease Index) questionnaire. Patients had been admitted to hospital for an average of 2.4 days (range 0–7) and had shown general symptoms for an average of 7.1 days (range 1–20) prior to ocular testing. Four (7.1%) of 56 conjunctival swabs and four (4%) of 112 Schirmer strips were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The mean E-gene cycle threshold values (Ct values) were 31.2 (SD 5.0) in conjunctival swabs and 32.9 (SD 2.7) in left eye Schirmer strips. Overall, 17 (30%) patients presented ocular symptoms. No association was found between positive ocular samples and ocular symptoms. This study shows that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected on the conjunctiva and tears of patients with COVID-19. Contact with the ocular surface may transmit the virus and preventive measures should be taken in this direction.

 What is very clear however is that vaccination is primarily something you do for your own protection. I based my decision whether or not I needed protection by looking at my countries statistics.

I'm not the OP, but OP's point is correct. The **numbers** in July were *almost* the target level we should reach to open up. See my other posts on this thread for the Fauci Formula that he has advocated since March 2020 -- 10k cases daily in the US (30 per 1M residents). With the current all-pandemic CFR that would be about 160 deaths daily (about 0.5 deaths per 1M residents), which is about as bad as a bad year of seasonal influenza (60k deaths annually). 

You'll read above I said we *almost* reached the target in July 2021. Since we didn't actually reach the target, we shouldn't have been unrestricted yet -- but people were too impatient to wait until we actually reached the target and decided to stop caring. We all saw the result.

Since the CFR has been trending down, Fauci's initial case number may be able to be a bit higher, but how high depends on how well we control spread, apply treatments, and agree on an acceptable level of COVID deaths. In March 2020 10k cases was closer to 200 deaths than 160 in August 2021 (the last time I saw an interview where he used this number). So, if 200 deaths is the target, 12,500 cases daily should be low enough.

Sadly, we're still seeing almost 75,000 cases daily (225 per 1M residents) and more than 1,300 deaths (3.9 per 1M residents). COVID doesn't care how you feel about it. It doesn't stop spreading when you're tired of complying.

Background and Aims Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, has infected more than 153 million people and led to the death of 3.3 million others. It is estimated that people with cardiovascular risk factors are more prone for mortality and intubation. especially obesity, and his is especially true in Saudi Arabia and the region of Hail, where morbid obesity (BMI &gt;30) is at 33.6% of the population. Our aim is to establish an epidemiological link for our population between aspirin use, diabetes, obesity and percentage of intubated patients as we measured mortalities and readmissions in 30 days. Methods A retrospective cohort study of 753 patients admitted as positive COVID 19 patients, from April 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020, covering a period of 4 months. We then categorised the patient in cohorts according to the use of aspirin or not, existence of diabetes or not, and categorised them according to their BMI index. We then correlated using statistical tool analysis - SPSS statistics tool - intubation, mortality, readmittance in 30 days in these groups of patients Results Around 40% of our cases were diabetic. 18% of the diabetic cases intubated, instead of 7% of non DM cases. Mortalities were higher in the diabetic group as percentage (14% to 7%), and readmissions and lower in the aspirin group. Significant correlation between BMI and days of ICU stay Conclusions There is significant morbidity in DM patients with COVID 19, especially morbid obese.

That failure rate is significantly higher than what we found when we tested our own staff, but the failure rate for this type of pedestrian screening is almost always going to be higher than a layman would expect. 

The problems here are twofold. Firstly, removing aspects of the screening program that are currently in place to fix known vulnerabilities (for example, bans on liquids) is problematic, as it leaves a road map for future attackers for a more successful operation. Item bans (pressure cookers, etc) are actually highly effective, unlike X-Ray screening, which is prone to user error. 

Secondly, while the X-Ray screening process is a flawed process for preventing weapons from getting onto an aircraft, it's still the centerpiece of the effort to keep air transportation safe, as no better methods exist.

Eliminating the most effective methods (item bans) while keeping the least effective (X-Ray screening) is a recipe for disaster. Failures in RvB simulations don't result in 9-11. Failures to run RvB simulations DO result in 9-11. I'm sure TSA made reforms after that disastrous report, which was newsworthy, but represents the very low end of what modern pedestrian screening can accomplish.",,,,1635870169,{},hj10ck6,False,t3_qkdwqq,False,True,t1_hj0k1ty,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qkdwqq/the_plexiglass_barrier_problem_vaccines_masks_and/hj10ck6/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,b7acc00ff019de6cb394951deb1a60a9e570a11d,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1635870183.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

If you look, the two stories I linked are two years apart. If you hit the google machine, you will find an unbroken record of disastrous failure rates since 2001. You can be as sure as you want about what the TSA is doing, but reality is unsympathetic to your emotions. What the TSA is doing is continuing to fuck up.

&gt;Secondly, while the X-Ray screening process is a flawed process for preventing weapons from getting onto an aircraft, it's still the centerpiece of the effort to keep air transportation safe, as no better methods exist.

""It doesn't work but we have to keep doing it because it's the centerpiece of our efforts and no better methods exist"" is the worst argument I can imagine. It's almost meaningless. In TSA's own tests, the failure rate is in excess of 80%--perhaps in excess of 95%--yet the costs of these ridiculous screening machines are substantial. For one thing, we spend billions of dollars per year on the TSA, just direct cash costs, much of which goes to buying useless machines. For another, the more radiation we're forcing people to endure to get on an airplane, the worse. Relatedly, the more [unnecessarily coercive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_TAoMUVeVg) and [invasive](https://thenewamerican.com/tsa-blasted-for-exposing-breasts-of-congressmans-teen-grandniece/https://thenewamerican.com/tsa-blasted-for-exposing-breasts-of-congressmans-teen-grandniece/) the security process, the worse.

&gt; I can't really comment on what procedures are or aren't effective, because I don't have access to TSA's internal testing data... but by the most important metric (hijackings since 9-11), the TSA is doing well.

I don't see how you can say this. Again: the only two attacks since 9/11 were foiled **by passengers**. The TSA has no evidence--**none**--that it is preventing or discouraging any attacks. Of course you support security theater, since that is apparently your job, but that's all it is. Theater. Actually, it's worse than theater, because the worst thing theater can do is be boring. The TSA, and agencies and procedures like it, actually makes us less free by subjecting us to invasions of privacy and insults to dignity that should not be tolerated without good cause, and normalizes accepting as good cause ""like, trust me bro, we're doing our best.""",,,,1635872770,{},hj16uwl,False,t3_qkdwqq,False,True,t1_hj10ck6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qkdwqq/the_plexiglass_barrier_problem_vaccines_masks_and/hj16uwl/,1636081521.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For an example of a disease for which proof of natural immunity *is* commonly accepted as a substitute for proof of vaccination, check out measles. [Here](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/requirements/mmr) is what UC Berkeley (to pick a random organization) requires for proof of immunity in lieu of an MMR vaccine:

&gt; One blood titer each for measles, mumps, and rubella showing evidence of immunity to each.

&gt; If your titer results do not show evidence of immunity, you will still be required to get any outstanding doses of the vaccine(s) as indicated above.

We can't yet use antibody titers for COVID for this purpose because the correlates of immunity are not known for this disease. (This is also what's behind the uncertainty behind boosters fwiw.)

Everyone who can get vaccinated is eligible and can get one any time they want to. 

We’re gaining natural immunity through those that just choose not to get vaccinated for whatever reason. Cases don’t matter anymore, it’s about hospitalizations

In the sense of older people being more at risk, yes, the risk is personal. But in the sense of everyone's risk being proportional to the case rate (more or less by definition: if there's twice as many cases, you're twice as likely to be a case, although the risk of a case of COVID-19 varies widely), the risk is communal. And the US's obsession with individuality has meant that we continually look at the pandemic as an individual problem which is nonsense for a contagious disease, getting us things like the FDA's recent restricted recommendation of a third shot of Pfizer despite Israel's data showing it dramatically reduces cases when given to everyone (unfortunately, we don't have as good data for Moderna).

In terms of actual policies, I'm confused by discussions about reducing restrictions in the United States because as far as I know, no government in the United States has COVID-19-related rules restricting gatherings (unless you count requiring vaccine checks in some places in some situations).

I mean, that's kind of what happens when a vaccine is released. And, honestly, the idea that the vaccine is ""100"" is totally subjective. I'd say having to take swab tests on a daily basis and 100% actually enforced masking are far more disruptive on a daily basis than getting a shot that's known to be safe. 

Considering the origin of this entire uproar against the vaccine is almost certainly borne in politics, I don't think moving the bar of social acceptance toward ""Service workers can reject life-saving vaccines during a pandemic"" isn't at all helpful.

Plus, and I think quite important from the ""union"" perspective, this is literally for their own good. COVID-19 exposure was the [cause of over half of firefighter fatalities in 2020](https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Publications-and-media/NFPA-Journal/2021/Winter-2021/Reports/FF-Deaths-2020)- 78 out of 140.

And the QR code check… it’s not even enforced now. Today had a coffee in a cafe with a colleague and our codes were not checked, despite the sign in the door saying it would be. So I am not confident in this either until the government stands up and actually enforces it.

With only 29% of people feeling confident in the government right now, I don’t see this helping at all. It is more of the same from Rutte &amp; Co. as it has been for the entire pandemic.

I'm ok if you want to keep wearing a mask, and would even support permanent legislation making it illegal for public places to ban masks. but I completely hate the mask, as someone on the autism spectrum it causes me massive sensory and claustaphobia issues.  I think the trade off of a slighlty increased risk of covid, flu, colds etc after vaccination and even booster shot is worth not wearing it.   Its time for it to quit being forced on us, because the death risk to vaccinated people is now less than a typical flu season, especially after booster shot.  And the risk of death or hospitalization to an unvaccinated child is even less than a vaccinated adult.  Therefore, by the logic if we can mandate masks now, we can always mandate them. The risk to unvaccinated adults is much higher higher than that, but they made a dumb choice and should be responsible for the consequences of their choice, not us.

Background  
Fluvoxamine, an SSRI and sigma-1 receptor agonist, has so far shown promise in the prevention of COVID-19 progression as an early treatment option in 3 conducted trials. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fluvoxamine in COVID-19 patients if administered later in the disease’s course.  
  
Methods  
The study was designed as an open label, prospective cohort trial with matched controls. In April and May 2021, 51 ICU COVID-19 patients hospitalised in the University Hospital Dubrava and University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Croatia, were treated with fluvoxamine 100mg three times daily for 15 days in addition to standard therapy and they were prospectively matched for age, gender, vaccination against COVID-19, disease severity and comorbidities with 51 ICU controls.  
  
Results  
No statistically significant differences between groups were observed regarding the number of days on ventilator support, duration of ICU or total hospital stay. However, overall mortality was lower in the fluvoxamine group, 58.8% (n=30/51), than in the control group, 76.5% (n=39/51), HR 0.58, 95%CI (0.36 – 0.94, p = 0.027).  
  
Conclusion  
Fluvoxamine treatment in addition to the standard therapy in hospitalised ICU COVID-19 patients could have a positive impact on patient survival. Further studies on the effects of fluvoxamine in COVID-19 patients are urgently required.",,,,1635861716,{},hj0g6mm,True,t3_ql4vtn,False,False,t3_ql4vtn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ql4vtn/safety_and_efficacy_of_fluvoxamine_in_covid19_icu/hj0g6mm/,1636066502.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; Once we’ve defined what we are trying to prevent, we can define thresholds for lifting and, if necessary, reinstating COVID-19 measures. This can actually be quite tricky if the goal is minimizing hospitalizations, a lagging indicator that gives you a picture of the past rather than the present. By the time hospitalizations start to rise, a bigger increase may already be baked in with people already infected but not yet sick enough to see a doctor. What to track instead?
&gt;
&gt; Here are some answers I got from scientific experts: hospitalizations and deaths, but stratified by age and vaccination status; a combination of vaccination rate and local transmission; a combination of vaccination rate and hospitalizations; a combination of long-COVID cases, hospitalizations, and deaths; a combination of case growth rate, testing uptake, vaccination rate, and hospitalizations.

What we actually care about is severe outcomes over some indefinite future timeframe, but cases are the most up-to-date data available for predicting that. As the shape of the pandemic changes due to vaccination, changing NPIs, new variants, more people getting infected, etc., exactly how current cases translates to future severe outcomes may change, so it's complicated. But it's straightforward that all else being equal, doubling ~~cases~~ infections (for which cases is a proxy) means double the severe outcomes... just that we never have that ""all else being equal"" (e.g. cases aren't evenly distributed in the population, hence one of the recommendations being to stratify them by age/vaccination status to get a better picture of the status), so it's complicated to use that information.",,,,1635888611,{},hj2bsz8,False,t3_qklvm7,False,True,t1_hj28tdj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qklvm7/america_has_lost_the_plot_on_covid/hj2bsz8/,1636102526.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;  
&gt;Weight is an important factor when you give a young child medication like Tylenol because there is a wide variation in weight from infancy throughout childhood and too much of the drug could be toxic.  
&gt;  
&gt;The optimal vaccine dose, however, is dependent on age and tailored to minimize potential side effects. A small 5-year-old and a large 5-year-old will have immune systems that are “functionally similar,” said Dr. David J. Rawlings, chief of the division of immunology at Seattle Children’s Hospital and director of the Center for Immunity Immunotherapies at Seattle Children’s Research Institute.  
&gt;  
&gt;And children in the 5 to 11 age group “have a really robust immune system,” he added. That means they can get a lower vaccine dose than those in the 12 to 17 age group and still produce the same number of antibodies.

&gt;I'm not missing any point. People are using hyperbole: claiming wearing a mask is a punishment, when it literally isn't.

People saying that masks are an inconvenience, or difficult, or feel like a punishment is their subjective opinion. You can disagree in your personal opinion, but dismissing it completely is nonsense. 

&gt;This isn't anywhere in the West, so it's a silly argument unless you're in Taiwan.

The entire NE has a high vaccination rate that blunted the Delta spread, and kept the death rate and hospitalizations manageable throughout the surge. That's the entire point. 

&gt;People are being disingenuous saying masks are a punishment, masks are putting their life on hold, etc. They can simply say they don't like masks and are ok with thousands of deaths a day if they would just be honest.

Now who is throwing around hyperbole? In highly vaccinated areas there aren't thousands of people dying a day, and there wasn't during the entire delta surge.
