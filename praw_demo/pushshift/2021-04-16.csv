### Findings

During the first surge (ie, before June, 2020), 533 381 people were tested, of whom 11 727 (2·20%) were PCR positive, and 525 339 were eligible for follow-up in the second surge, of whom 11 068 (2·11%) had tested positive during the first surge. Among eligible PCR-positive individuals from the first surge of the epidemic, 72 (0·65% \[95% CI 0·51–0·82\]) tested positive again during the second surge compared with 16 819 (3·27% \[3·22–3·32\]) of 514 271 who tested negative during the first surge (adjusted RR 0·195 \[95% CI 0·155–0·246\]). **Protection against repeat infection was 80·5%** (95% CI 75·4–84·5). The alternative cohort analysis gave similar estimates (adjusted RR 0·212 \[0·179–0·251\], estimated protection 78·8% \[74·9–82·1\]). In the alternative cohort analysis, among those aged 65 years and older, observed protection against repeat infection was 47·1% (95% CI 24·7–62·8). We found no difference in estimated protection against repeat infection by sex (male 78·4% \[72·1–83·2\] *vs* female 79·1% \[73·9–83·3\]) or **evidence of waning protection over time (3–6 months of follow-up** 79·3% \[74·4–83·3\] *vs* ≥7 months of follow-up 77·7% \[70·9–82·9\]).",,,1618660071,{},guu54zn,False,t3_mso046,False,True,t3_mso046,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mso046/assessment_of_protection_against_reinfection_with/guu54zn/,1618660083,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The us was earlier for Pfizer/BioNTech, I get this but it’s highly questionable that this one month would have made a difference. 

You are right, there is a legal difference between a ban and a contact, but that doesn’t help say Canada, which is waiting for vaccines for example. Also obviously other countries like India and the EU could have negotiated similar contracts, but didn’t. 
That being said, in the US *there has been at least one executive order* that has been used to halt exports of ingredients, which for example lead to production problems at the serum institute of India. 
On the contrary, for example the J&amp;J vaccine for example is produced at least partially in Europe, then shipped to US for bottling where it then is distributed. 

I get your points about legal differences between and contracts and the us delivering earlier, really. But my point is a much more basic one: if everybody would have played the same game as the US, the US also wouldn’t be in the situation it is right now. Export restrictions make vaccine production more difficult for everybody. And it’s really sad to see nationalism hindering the global fight of the catastrophe Covid has been..

We kept getting told we are putting each other at risk with social gatherings. Yet if I was gathering of my friends it would be at most 10-15 people, all of whom could easily work from home.

You need an epidemiologist to answer this question, and I'm not one :-)

&gt; Are the satistics reliable?

Yes, they're reliable in the sense that they show the general situation. Before somebody jumps in with the regular ""Russia is lying about the numbers!!!"" comment, I will elaborate:

1. The daily cases published by Rospotrebnadzor is the number of PCR tests that were confirmed over the past day (and nobody catches every case). There's, for instance, the register of COVID patients which is formed based on the data hospitals report and the numbers there are different because PCR isn't the only way to diagnose. 

1. There's one thing you can't hide or fake - the healthcare system load. And it correlates with the numbers published by Rospotrebnadzor, as the daily cases went down hospitals began returning to their normal work and the hospital beds, previously reserved for COVID cases, returned to tge general pool.

Merkel's party (CDU/CSU, or called Union) polls on the same level or worse than before the pandemic. That has several reasons:

* Weak pandemic response: The first wave was handled very well and put us in the summer of 2020 in a better situation than most EU countries. However, this advantage was lost with the second and third waves. The Union holds key positions in the pandemic. The Chancellor, the minister of health, seven out of sixteen minister presidents of the federal states representing more than half of the population. While Merkel is more in favour of tougher action against the virus, she has no power besides coordinating the states. The meetings she is holding with them become more and more useless. Minister presidents of her own party are changing the policy they all agreed upon just a day before. Most Germans are in favour of harder measurements. The politicians focus only on restrictions that affects the private life, like nightly curfews and no-contact orders. Workplaces and school are not touched, because it could weaken the economy. 
* Corruption scandal: Some politicians of Merkel's party have been involved in the procurement of masks and have organized deals with companies that can supply masks at the beginning of the pandemic. Recently it turned out that these politicians have enriched themselves and that unfavourable contracts for the taxpayer were signed.
* Merkel will not seek re-election: People now realising the consequences. Right now, the top topic in the media is who will be her successor. Two politicians in the CDU/CSU (Union) have stood out. Armin Laschet, who is very unpopular because he reacted very weakly to the pandemic as minister president of Germany's largest state. He always pleaded for relaxations of measurements, even though the Covid cases went up. The other one is Markus Söder, minister president of Bavaria. He is in the CSU, the sister party of the CDU. The party is known to pursue only Bavarian politics. Many at the top of the CDU are against a CSU chancellor. There is no regulated process like in the U.S. as to who becomes the chancellor candidate fot the party. It is very messy.

&gt; **Press release of the French National Academy of Medicine**   

&gt; *April 8, 2021* 

&gt; Nasopharyngeal swabbing followed by detection of the viral genome with RT-PCR has become the gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A nasal swab is also required for antigenic testing. In view of the multiplication and repetition of this procedure for getting samples, sometimes carried out under unsuitable conditions, it is important to remember the precautions to be observed and  the  risks  incurred.  While  some complications  can  be considered  benign (discomfort, pain or bleeding), serious complications have started to be described in the medical literature in recent weeks, especially breaches of the anterior skull base associated with a risk of meningitis [1-3].   

&gt; In order not to neglect the risk of injury induced  by the widespread use of nasopharyngeal swabs carried out on a massive scale in the context of Covid-19, the French National Academy of Medicine reminds the good practices to be followed:    
&gt; - Before any sampling, inquire about any accidental or surgical history of the ENT sphere that might have modified the anatomy of the nasal and sinus cavities, particularly procedures concerning the septum, the inferior nasal concha and the facial sinuses [4];    
&gt; - Do not hyperextend the patient's head during sampling, but hold it in a natural position with the chin parallel to the ground;   
&gt; - Introduce the swab horizontally along the floor of the nasal cavity, and never deflect it upwards towards the skull base.    

&gt; In addition, the French National Academy of Medicine recommends:   
&gt; - to reserve the practice of nasopharyngeal swabs to health professionals trained to perform this procedure under rigorous technical conditions;   
&gt;  -  in  children,  to  give  preference  to  salivary  samples  for  their  safety  and acceptability;   
&gt; - to warn users of self-tests that self-sampling can lead to false negatives when swabbing is too timid and superficial, but can also become dangerous when swabbing is too deep and directed in the wrong direction.

Yet despite plentiful supply only about 8% of the population have chosen to get a shot. One reason is rock-bottom trust in the government, the product of two years of political turmoil.

Oh they actually have free choices and plentiful supply. The only thing they are not happy with is politics.

&gt; In September the government offered free covid-19 tests to the entire population. That policy borrowed from mandatory citywide testing campaigns that had taken place in some parts of mainland China. Yet fewer than 1.8m Hong Kong residents accepted the screening, out of 7.5m. Refusing the test was a way of expressing dissatisfaction with the government. And some suspicious residents fretted that their dna might end up in mainland China. 

Refusing to be tested for covid = Unhappy with the gov = DNA not collected (?)

&gt;The global death toll stands at 2,990,993, while the number of confirmed coronavirus cases has surged to nearly 140 million, according to a New York Times database, as countries race to provide enough vaccines to slow the relentless pace of infections.

&gt;The pace of deaths has been accelerating. The world did not record one million deaths until Sept. 28, but had recorded two million by Feb. 21, less than five months later. And the latest million took under two months.

&gt;The United States, Brazil and Mexico lead the world in Covid-19 deaths.

&gt;In the United States, more than 564,800 virus-related deaths have been confirmed, about one in 567 people — the most of any other country.

&gt;In Latin America, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Argentina and others have been hit hard by the virus.

&gt;Mexico has recorded more than 211,000 deaths. By comparison, Japan, which has a similar sized population, has had just 9,507 deaths.

&gt;In Brazil, where the spread of the virus has been fueled by a highly contagious variant, political infighting and distrust of science, more than 365,000 people have died. The virus is still pummeling the country, which is averaging over 2,900 deaths per day.

&gt;The leaders of both countries, which are the region’s two largest nations, have largely dismissed the dangers and have resisted calls for a lockdown.

&gt;India, the country with the fourth-highest number of total coronavirus deaths, has recorded more than 174,300 deaths. The virus is surging there once again, prompting more shutdowns and another mass migration away from big cities.

&gt;In the United Kingdom — where Britain recently ended one of the longest and most stringent lockdowns in the world — more than 127,100 deaths have been recorded. And in Italy, once the nightmarish epicenter of the virus, there have been almost 116,000 confirmed deaths.

!Sweden, where officials have taken a more lax approach to combating the coronavirus, has experienced an increase in new cases and deaths recently, with more than 13,700 deaths.

&gt;As dangerous virus variants spread, many developed countries are racing to vaccinate their populations as fast as possible. More than 841 million vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, though some countries have yet to report a single dose, according to a New York Times database that tracks the worldwide rollout of shots.

*pp are* [*percentage points*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point)*, the arithmetic difference between today's percentage and a prior date.  For example, if a group was 55.0% today and 50.0% before, this is a 5.0 pp difference.*

Notes:

* Data from [CDC vaccination demographic trends page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends) and exact totals for every age group can be downloaded as a CSV.  The site provides a graph of this data over time.  While the graph title says it is by ""Date Administered"", the data more closely represents doses by ""Date Reported"".
* Changes are calculated on unrounded numbers and may differ from rounded percentages.
* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC source due to lack of age-related vaccination data, so data does not match national totals.
* The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group. The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, and assumes that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17 since no vaccines are currently approved for use under age 16.
* 16+ and 0+ age groups include doses administered to those of unknown ages. This is usually less than 0.02% of the total doses administered.",,,1618686869,{},guvyxzh,False,t3_mswylo,False,False,t3_mswylo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mswylo/us_administers_2059_mln_doses_of_covid19_vaccines/guvyxzh/,1618692306,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

For some people it has become a competition of pointing out rule breakers and it brings out the ugly side in people. It's especially annoying when these people can't be bothered to get the facts right and are criticizing the wrong behavior (they get mad at someone for not wearing a mask outside for example).

I also agree that a ton of people have gone legitimately stir crazy and its weird to me when I encounter someone who doesn't think the last year will not have serious psychological consequences. Self isolation combined with modern technology is not a good recipe.

I also agree with basically opening almost everything up right now or in the coming weeks and think that is pretty much happening. 

I really don't know where you are getting your stats on masks though man. We know masks stop a lot of the spread and are very useful inside. It's not a magic shield but it will prevent a good amount of infections which is a big deal for a virus that spreads exponentially.

I have a math background and I think people really don't understand how big the difference between vaccinating 40% (just old people) and 75%. People like you and me getting vaccinated truly can be the difference between making this virus very abundant vs constantly declining until its basically irrelevant. I agree old people should without a doubt be the priority but we are mostly past that point and it would still be incredibly helpful.

I'm sure you've made a ton of major sacrifices to your normal life during this pandemic. I know I have. The vaccine is so minor and costless compared to all we've had to deal with.

If compliance was enough to save lives then we wouldn't have as many cases as we do, the fat is there's a lot of compliance and the minority that are breaking the rules aren't the sole reason for Covid spread and we should treat them as such. 

It's been a year and people have a right to be fed up at this point. I'm going to continue to wear proper PPE and whatnot for the time being but I'm not going to grill someone for not wearing a mask or some shit when the majority of people are wearing cloth masks that do fuck all anyway (I recently read a paper that shows N95's to be pretty much the only thing that's effective. These fashionable cloth masks are a whopping 3% effective. You're not saving anyone with a cloth mask, you're virtue signalling). In general I believe that measures to control the pandemic should be taken but I respect people's autonomy and right to live their life how they want to.

We've got data on who the most at-risk are from covid. Vaccinate 50+ and front line workers as much as possible and open shit up. I think that if that happens it will gain the government a bit more trust and the lower-risk populations can vaccinate at a more leisurely pace.

1. Is the legislative goal pressing and substantial? i.e., is the objective sufficiently important to justify limiting a Charter right?

2. Is there proportionality between the objective and the means used to achieve it?

The second branch of the test has three elements:

a) ""Rational Connection"": the limit must be rationally connected to the objective. There must be a causal link between the impugned measure and the pressing and substantial objective;

b) ""Minimal Impairment"": the limit must impair the right or freedom no more than is reasonably necessary to accomplish the objective. The government will be required to show that there are no less rights-impairing means of achieving the objective “in a real and substantial manner”

https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-double-mutant-could-be-considered-a-variant-of-concern-101618428592954.html

&gt;The double mutation refers to specific changes, among some others, that are denoted by E484Q (glutamate is replaced by glutamine at the 484th spot of the spike protein) and L452R (substitution of leucine with arginine at the 452nd position). Both these mutations are being investigated for giving the virus an ability to evade immunity from a past infection, even vaccines.

 
&gt;On March 24, the Union health ministry said the variant was found in over 200 samples sent from Maharashtra, which became the first hot spot region during the second nationwide wave that began that month. Till about April 7, Maharashtra alone was accounting for more than half of the new cases being recorded in the country, prompting experts to suspect that the variant may be to blame.

&gt;VijayRaghavan added that vaccines are likely to still offer protection from variants of concern. “The vaccines at hand sometimes offer reduced protection to mild and moderate disease but they still afford protection to severe disease,” he said.

&gt;The official also spoke on the government’s recent decision to make it easier for vaccines developed outside to seek authorisation in India as long as they have been approved by certain western countries, Japan or the World Health Organization.

&gt; combination low platelets 

There is no concrete proof that I have seen that state the low platelets are related to the blood clots. We are seeing low platelets but that could be related or unrelated to the clots. There are a few theories on what is causing them if the vaccines are. The platelets very well may be causing the clots, they can also be a unrelated side effect. Covid does cause blood clots, low platelets &amp; the spike used may be causing the same immune response causing the issue.







If your choice is wait for MRNA or AZ are you going to wait to vaccinate your most vulnerable ? If you have all the mrna you can use sure be cautious. But when the choice is AZ now or maybe mrna come summer for 70+ would you wait ? I think what's lost in the debate is risk where mrna is not available.

That's what the US did. It bought several vaccine doses, including those from Pfizer and Moderna, back in July-ish, during a time when they had no idea whether those vaccines would be effective or not. It was a gamble, but that gamble paid off. The EU government, however, played penny-wise-pound-foolish with the vaccine orders by negotiating prices when in reality they could've just paid for them. This negotiation caused a lot of delays during which many other countries placed orders from manufacturers allowing them to get ahead in the line.

Vaccine manufacturers are contractually obliged to fulfill these orders on time and deliver these vaccines to the respective governments that purchased them. The EU isn't doing some ""right thing"" for the ulterior good by allowing its manufacturers to export vaccines; they're exporting vaccines because they had purchase orders from outside the EU before the EU itself.

I'm from India and we have a similar predicament. Our largest manufacturer Serum Institute (AZ vaccines) has been exporting &gt;50% of its production to hundreds of countries, including the UK, Canada, and several other third-world nations. It isn't the fault of the SII that they're exporting so much, the problem is that our government failed to place sufficient orders in time.

&gt;The B.1.617 strain's mutations are feared to make the variant spread faster and partially evade immunity. The variant is believed to be largely responsible for India's current second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, with infection rates and hospitalisations on the rise once again.

&gt;It also led to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson deciding to shorten the length of his India visit later this month, with the bulk of the events now expected to be limited to a day-long packed schedule on April 26.

It's easy to say ""yeah my healthcare is pretty good"" when you're a healthy 32 year old who doesn't have to go to the hospital. But medical debt is a serious problem in the US.

Medical tourism happens everywhere. And, yeah, the US being good at specialty medicine doesn't mean it's a good healthcare system as a whole. You also care about, for example, access to regular checkups and stuff. Access to primary care is so underrated on multiple dimensions.

&gt; profit incentivized competition based, private healthcare breed innovation where government owned healthcare breeds mediocrity

Competition based, private healthcare in a system where pricing is entirely opaque to the consumer? Doesn't work, we've tried it. Functionally, there'll always be the issue that we, as a society, don't want some intrepid 23 year old to take the skimpiest health insurance policy at all (or, no health insurance at all), get cancer, and literally just die. If we treat him anyway, someone's paying for it and goodbye free market healthcare. Just doesn't make sense in 2021 from where society has progressed to.

(While I'm on that note, I do think free market healthcare solutions are illustrative in reminding us that incentives exist.For people who want free everything healthcare, there's nothing stopping someone from getting a $1000 MRI with limited medical benefit besides time.

If we assume herd immunity is around 65% (based on Israeli numbers)

The US sits at 38.5% of the population with 1+ dose.

If we assume that the US has the following natural immunity, this is what we need left to get to 65%:


10% natural immunity (about what found cases are at)- 20.5% more to go 

20% natural immunity - 15.5% more to go

25% natural immunity (what cdc estimated we were at by end of year 2020) - 13.5% more to go

30% natural immunity - 11.5% more to go.


The CDC estimated back in Dec that we were at about 25% (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html)

It obviously would have gone up from there but even at 25%  - we have 13.5% more to go to reach 65%.

This cheap covid vaccine is based on a flu vaccine that Butantan already makes (80 million flu doses in 3 months AFAIK). The new method will in theory helps making mass production of this new COVID vaccine easier. They are promissing 40 million doses until July.       
Quick deepl translation below in a very understandable way!   


&gt; **Butanvac is a hybrid between a recombinant and inactivated vaccine**

&gt; Scientists have put the coronavirus spike protein S gene into a viral vector, which is like a Trojan horse carrying this gene. The vector is the Newcastle disease virus (NDV)    
But why did they do that?     
NDV is from the Paramyxoviridae family, which has other famous representatives like measles virus, mumps, viruses that cause respiratory diseases and many that cause diseases in animals...     
The NDV itself is a bird virus, and that is where the clever thing that the Butantan Institute has done is!   

&gt; You see, multiplying viruses in chicken embryonic eggs is a very practical and cheap process. The problem is that Sars-CoV2 does not multiply in these eggs. Scientists have solved this by putting a piece of the coronavirus into NDV (bird virus)!   
Now the production can be done in eggs.   


&gt; Another advantage is that NDV can be handled in a safety level 2 (BL2) laboratory instead of the BL3 used for Sars-cov-2.    

&gt; BL3 labs are very expensive to maintain. This makes the vaccine much cheaper! 
NDV causes disease in birds, but in humans it is almost harmless. Most cases are asymptomatic, or at most mild flu-like symptoms.   

&gt; Also, the virus is inactivated and fragmented before it is turned into a vaccine. So it is very safe!   
The NDV fragments can contribute to stimulate our immune system, working as an adjuvant.   
So when our cells encounter the Spike protein fragments from the coronavirus, they will develop a much stronger and more robust response.",,,1618623985,{},gusm4yl,False,t3_msg65z,False,True,t1_gusg9oi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/msg65z/human_trials_begin_for_a_lowcost_covid19_vaccine/gusm4yl/,1618632489,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

To me, as a layperson, the most promising thing is simply the breaking of the pattern.  It's always been the same story with covid in my state and I think almost everywhere just on varying scales of time; cases start slowly increasing, then exponentially surging, then the metrics start to falter and the curve starts to bend, then everything freefalls for about a month and spends another few weeks slowly bottoming out, and then ever so slowly here comes the slowly increasing cases again a couple more weeks later, and repeat.  It looked like it was happening again right on schedule, but then bam, suddenly a sustained ~5 day drop in all 7-day average metrics.

This India variant, called B.1.617, along with Brazil's P1 (and P2) seem to be ones people should not fuck around and should take extra seriously.

I feel we're kind of just relying on the notion that things will improve on their own, or that since we're vaccinating well we don't have to worry now. The amount of travel I'm seeing is insane. Some areas of the country look like pre pandemic already.

I'm worried though because at best it seems precarious. And most states seem to have given up, it's like the general public is giving it every opportunity to fail. And I live in Michigan, where it's starting to fail even with mask mandates and limitations still in place. And my county is 32% vaccinated, but we're literally in the worst we've been in so far here in my county.

Which I find very concerning, because on paper it shouldn't have happened. That should really raise alarms in every state, there is absolutely nothing stopping it from spreading.

But on paper that's only 1/3 of the planet's population, and those two vaccines also require freezing (at least for now).

Even before the possible failure of vectored vaccines (not gonna speculate on that) this leaves a substantial gap.  Even the worst vaccines we have are plenty good to end the pandemic, so we just need numbers right now.

And I really don't get it. If we *didn't* have stories like this, I would be a lot more skeptical about how much they're scrutinizing the safety of these vaccines. I would even argue you'd have to be unintelligent not to question a vaccine rollout where no officials are raising concerns about bad batches or mistakes.

I usually see the same response to those comments ""That's how *smart* people think, but most people aren't smart."" And again, those kinds of comments just annoy the hell out of me. Yeah there are obviously dumb people, but the kind of people who think ninety percent of the country are just clueless morons are probably pretty deluded about how intelligent they actually are. The average person is quite competent at thinking, we just don't write articles about people who are capable of perceiving accurate information and making an informed and reasonable conclusion based on it.

Safety checks are a very, very, *very* good and important thing. You can't think about how it's going to ""look."" If you start to think about the optics over reality- Well there you go, you're thinking about the optics over reality. You're saying it's more important to give the illusion of a smooth vaccine rollout than to have a scrutinized, safe, and effective vaccine rollout. If public health officials had that kind of attitude, why *would* you have faith in the vaccine?

Russia had +400,000 excess deaths from 2020 and only reported 70,000 covid deaths, for example.

But UK excess deaths turned out to be ~7% for 2020, which is bad, but not as bad as likes of Poland (12%) and Spain (11%), which didn't report covid numbers so accurately.

Be all that as it may. .there is still some fault correctly pointed at younger people ""mingling"" unsafely. I live in a downtown area and if I go out to walk around on a Friday or Saturday night,. the Bars and clubs and other ""social-spaces"" are packed to the gills with unmasked people. That's not a recipe for successfully beating a pandemic. 

I mean I get it.. you're ""pandemic-exhausted"" (or whatever they're calling it now). Here's the problem though:.. The virus doesn't get ""exhausted"". It doesn't cause how ""inconvenient"" you think it all is. It'll still do everything possible to infect and kill people.

I recall seeing a graph showing where the rate of new infections would decline around 10 days after the first vaccination (think it was Pfizer or Moderna). While that sounds promising, you aren't supposed to have your full immune response in place until a week or two after the 2nd dose. My general guideline would be to mask up to be safe, as it would suck to get the virus this close to having your full immunity.

If you mean a mixture of vaccinated and unvaccinated people, I think the unvaccinated people would have a higher risk of both contracting the virus and getting severely ill, whereas the vaccinated would have a greatly reduce chance of getting the virus and an even greater reduced chance of severe illness.

Basically, my mantra would be that if everyone is vaccinated, you can probably forego the masks.

&gt;**Vaccine effectiveness estimates – adjusted to account for variances in age, gender and the week specimens were collected** – were determined for the prevention of six laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 outcomes comparing unvaccinated and fully-vaccinated individuals: SARS-CoV-2 infections (includes symptomatic and asymptomatic infections); asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections; COVID-19 cases (symptomatic only); COVID-19 hospitalizations; severe (respiratory distress, including &gt;30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation on room air &lt;94%, and/or ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen &lt;300mm mercury) and critical (mechanical ventilation, shock, and/or heart, liver or kidney failure) COVID-19 hospitalizations; and COVID-19 deaths.

I find it HIGHLY irresponsible to make the claim that it can block 94% of asymptomatic infections. 

I think Pf is a really good vaccine already, I took their jab, and there is no reason to take positions on these things that are not verified, and of course, if they release that analysis and the methodology is good, then sure but at this moment, it seems to just be extrapolations adjusted, rather than real life.",,,1618611588,{},guryyjn,False,t3_ms42be,False,False,t1_gurxnn3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ms42be/chile_says_sinovac_shot_67_effective_vs/guryyjn/,1618620588,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I want to make it clear that I completely agree with you here. We are already past the point the point of hospitals being over run. Now that we have vaccinated most old people we are in a way better position than we have ever been. We used to have over 3000 people a day die. We are now under 1000 deaths and we are never going to go over 1000 again thanks the vaccines. I wish the media, public health officials and politicians did a better job at saying this and allowing us to celebrate the good news. 

We are in 100% agreement about vaccinating the vulnerable. We are basically done with that stage and now we are at a stage where the more people that get vaccinated the steeper the decline in cases and deaths and the less people have to worry. I guess I just am having trouble emphasizing with the desire to not get vaccinated. It's so damn easy idk. 

I also agree with you that if for whatever reason we can only get to 65% vaccinated it would still make no sense to keep things closed. We have to move on from the phase of strict social restrictions. Vaccines are saving us and we are returning to normal life, I just think we are better off the more people that are vaccinated and am having trouble understanding what the argument against getting vaccinated would be.",,,1618637878,{},gut870l,False,t3_mr9fq0,False,True,t1_gut6pi9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mr9fq0/daily_discussion_thread_april_15_2021/gut870l/,1618643932,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Primarily ""Studies have stated that cloth face masks are ineffective to prevent influenza-like diseases when compared to the surgical masks (relative risk 13.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.74–100.97). Moreover, filtration efficacy of cloth face mask was found as low as 3% on laboratory based filtration test of cloth masks, which could be because of poor quality of cloth used for making face mask.[11]"" 

That's just the paragraph that was most relevant to my claim but anyone reading the full text would understand that an N95 or surgical mask is really the only option if you're actually trying to make a difference. With this in mind I feel as though it might be prudent to take one of two approaches: either be transparent with your community and concede that masks genuinely do only work under specific conditions and simply wearing a facial covering isn't really all that it takes, or drop mask mandates if the proper PPE can't be worn on a widespread basis due to the very visible and very real polarization that it creates.

As far as numbers go, I like to think that I understand math quite well also. I have been working as a data scientist for 3 years now and spent 6 years prior obtaining the necessary credentials for that role complete with advanced degrees. My thesis was on statistical modeling. This isn't just a matter of dividing the population equally across the percentage scale. Each group should be weighted accordingly. If the majority of fatalities are in the 50+ age group (fatalities, not cases), which they are, massively, then it's more correct to think of this as such: 

If 80% of fatalities occur in 40% of the population, then yes, vaccinating *only* that 40% of the population is enough to reduce the number of fatalities by 80%. This leaves 60% of the population unvaccinated, yes, but healthcare systems are no longer over-loaded and the 60% that can still catch the virus are at low risk anyway. Buy that's not all, the virus has 40% less people to spread through, which may provide a sort of dampening effect and reduce the rate of infection among those still susceptible to the virus. 

In my opinion, the psychological and economic costs of keeping this going much longer will be incredibly dear. I am pretty convicted that the best way to go is to forge ahead and vaccinate those most at risk of fatalities and that the bar should not be set at ""70% vaccinated"" but rather ""80% of highly susceptible groups vaccinated"". At that point we open up and handle the rest comfortably, I feel that would be a reasonable balance between safety and the rest of the things that also matter",,,1618636741,{},gut6pi9,False,t3_mr9fq0,False,True,t1_gut2g3r,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mr9fq0/daily_discussion_thread_april_15_2021/gut6pi9/,1618643167,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

2. Poorer countries not getting less is also a great benefit, because hey, people in poorer countries deserve to live too.

3. If the vaccine is used for the most vulnerable group in every country, as it is happening, we prevent way more deaths then using it on -for example- whole Germany or France, while watching another Bergamo go down in Italy or Poland.

4. People will most likely with a high percentage interact a lot with people of their own nationality, for many reasons, first of all geografically of course. So if you now vaccinated every European country with lets say a nice rate of 60%, the danger of getting and spreading infections is already greatly reduced. If we just vaccinate certain countries first up to a rate of an -utopical- 100% and others are still at 15%, there will be a much higher infection rate again due to geografical sources (people are more likely to infect their neighbour then a vaccinated person 500 km away in a different country, to clear up my point). There you see that spreading and vaccinating everywhere helps more then just vaccinating one country and not noticing the bad effects this causes in other countries.

Tl;dr (but please read the link): 

Regular trials for completely new drugs are usually proceeding as in the image you posted, they take a long time because the scientifc basis need to be established, manufacturing processes need to be created and medically tested, etc..   
This isn't happening now because scientists were relatively quickly able to isolate the generic sequence of the virus and create a vaccine against it based on existing technology, therefore some trial phases  could be cut out or shortened.  
The manufactures still had to recruit willing test subjects and test and monitor them as per usual, but the amount of persons and test cycles were lower than normal. This is IMO when the most dangerous immeatate side-effects should occur.  
But because this process is so special, every country needed to approve the expedited trials before buying and using the vaccines.

We, the patients, are **not** part of the inital studies regarding effiency or potential side effects.

Pfizer currently has emergency use authorization for those who are 16 years old or older. Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Astrazeneca are all 18+. Pfizer was the only one to include 16 and 17-year-olds in their initial clinical trials.

Last week, Pfizer requested that the FDA expand authorization to adolescents ages 12-15, and said that they would make similar authorization requests in other countries this week.

Both Pfizer and Moderna are currently studying the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines in pediatric trials.

It’s becoming a free for all and city governments, private companies and even homeowners’ associations are trying to source vaccines on their own so that their people can be protected, but the national government won’t let them bring vaccines in unless they donate the same number of doses to the government (or they will take 50% of the doses bought).

*pp are* [*percentage points*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point)*, the arithmetic difference between today's percentage and a prior date.  For example, if a group was 55.0% today and 50.0% before, this is a 5.0 pp difference.*

Notes:

* Data from [CDC vaccination demographic trends page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends) and exact totals for every age group can be downloaded as a CSV.  The site provides a graph of this data over time.  While the graph title says it is by ""Date Administered"", the data more closely represents doses by ""Date Reported"".
* Changes are calculated on unrounded numbers and may differ from rounded percentages.
* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC source due to lack of age-related vaccination data, so data does not match national totals.
* The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group. The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, and assumes that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17 since no vaccines are currently approved for use under age 16.
* 16+ and 0+ age groups include doses administered to those of unknown ages.

[],,chilladipa,,,[],,,,text,t2_6z8harzu,False,False,[],"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The second surge of COVID-19 cases in India has swamped hospitals much faster than the first because mutations in the virus mean each patient is infecting many more people than before, epidemiologists and doctors say.

India's daily infections skyrocketed more than 20-fold to more than 200,000 on Thursday since a multi-month-low in early February, though the government has played down the role of mutants in the latest rise, the worst anywhere this month.

The world's hardest-hit country after the United States has reported about 950 cases of people contracting the variants first detected in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil.

""The point is that these variants of concern are still not on top of the discourse,"" said epidemiologist Rajib Dasgupta of New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.

""Even if it is a new variant, you need to do the same things"" to control it and treat patients ""but it requires a different urgency to recognise that"", he said.

Doctors at New Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences have found that one patient is now infecting up to nine in 10 contacts, compared with up to four last year.

Scientists in Britain say the B.1.1.7 version of the virus, widely known as the UK variant, is 70% more transmissible than previous versions, and potentially deadlier.

The northern Indian state of Punjab, which has reported one of the highest recent fatality rates in the country, said late last month 81% of 401 COVID-19 samples it sent for genome sequencing were found to be the UK variant.

""This virus is more infectious and virulent,"" said Dhiren Gupta, a senior consultant at New Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.

""More children are reporting high-grade fever compared to last year. We have 35-year olds with pneumonia in intensive care, which was not happening last year.""

India has recorded 14.1 million infections and 173,123 deaths in total.

MASS GATHERINGS

The government has mainly attributed the big rise in cases to a reluctance to wear marks and crowding.

Still, it has refused to call off a mass gathering of Hindu devotees for a festival and its ministers are addressing tens of thousands of largely mask-less people in election rallies.

A scientist at the National Institute of Epidemiology said more evidence was needed to directly link the rise in cases to the variants, but that anecdotally that seemed to be the case.

""There are in-vitro experiments which can also tell us about the infectivity, the severity, how lethal it is, etc, but those are not completed yet, they are ongoing,"" said Tarun Bhatnagar.

""We haven't had a virus that has spread so rapidly, and we haven't had the time to study it. Everything is on the go. We are dealing with it, being affected by it and studying it. The pace of every thing is too fast.""

But with crowding still common in many regions of India, ""we are about to find out just how dangerous this strain is"", said Om Srivastava, head of infectious diseases at Mumbai's Jaslok Hospital who also advises India's worst-hit Maharashtra state.",,,1618684677,{},guvucz6,True,t3_mswa7d,False,True,t3_mswa7d,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mswa7d/virus_variants_inciting_indias_second_surge/guvucz6/,1618689757,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

From reporting under 10,000 new daily cases earlier this year, daily infections crossed 200,000 on Thursday, according to official data, the highest anywhere in the world.

At Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital (LNJP), one of India's largest COVID-only facilities with more than 1,500 beds, a stream of ambulances ferried patients to the overflowing casualty ward on Thursday.

Some also arrived in buses and three-wheeled autorickshaws.

The youngest patient was a new-born baby.

""We are definitely over-burdened. We are already working at full capacity,"" said the hospital's medical director, Suresh Kumar.

From an initial 54 beds, the hospital now has over 300 for COVID-19 patients in critical condition. Even that is not enough.

Unrelated patients share beds, while bodies of the recently deceased lie outside the ward before being taken to the mortuary.

""Today we have 158 admissions in Lok Nayak alone,"" Kumar said. Almost all were severe cases.

After imposing one of the world's strictest lockdowns for nearly three months last year, India's government relaxed almost all curbs by the beginning of 2021, although many regions have now introduced localised restrictions.

LNJP's Kumar said fast-spreading new variants that evade testing were adding to the burden, as was human behaviour as the country reopened.

""People are not following the COVID guidelines,"" he said. ""They are just careless.""

Yeah, you're mixing levels here. I doubt it's intentional, but it's just not helpful to make generalizations like that in support of or in contradiction to more specific statements.

&gt; Free vaccines are not a new thing to people in the US.

These words could be technically true if *10%* of people in the USA had a free flu shot last year, 20% knew about it but didn't partake, and the other 70% were eligible for it but didn't know about it.

So... A pretty useless statement.

Do you have numbers? Then give them.

I'd say that it only takes about 20% of Americans to *not know* there is a covid vaccine available free to them, for your vague ""are not a new thing to..."" phrase to be as bad as incorrect. But even if less than 20%, it's still not a helpful statement.

We've been through this already. With the introduction of PREP a large segment of people ditched condoms and returned to their preferred form of activity, even with the risk of other STIs. The stigma of getting something like Gonorrhea has all but dissipated among the younger generations, and the prevailing consensus now is that people have the right to decide their own risk aversion strategies. 


For COVID, you really think that there is some sort of social stigma regarding people who have decided to reclaim their lives? Maybe in these echo chamber message boards (but doubtful considering how much you're being downvoted). In reality there is more of a negative stigma towards people who think these restrictions should continue forever, or that we will need to completely change our lives. 

You said it yourself, bars and restaurants are packed. People are out and about. They understand how the virus is spread and have made that decision anyways. People are making their own risk aversion assessments and consciously deciding that they would rather take the risk and rejoin the world.

Nearly 4,000 people who received COVID-19 vaccinations at a Colorado Springs medical spa need to be re-vaccinated because health officials have been unable to verify that the vaccines were properly stored there, the Colorado Department of Public Health said Tuesday.

The department stopped vaccinations at Dr. Moma Health and Wellness Clinic on Friday after county health officials observed problems in vaccine storage there. About 3,000 doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were confiscated, according to The Gazette, as the state launched an investigation into whether what was seen by health officials was isolated or not.

On Tuesday, the department said the shots given at the clinic are considered invalid because the clinic was unable to provide documentation that the vaccines were kept at the proper temperature.

No one answered the telephone at the clinic on Wednesday and there was no way to leave a message. According to its website, it offers mostly aesthetic services such as facials, acne treatment and tattoo removal and is led by Sylvienash Moma, who holds a doctorate of nursing degree.

After consulting with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the department released guidance saying that people who received one dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines should should start their two-shot vaccination series over again. People should get a new first shot 21 days later for Pfizer and 28 days later for Moderna.

Those who are unsure should wait at least 28 days before getting a new first dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, with the follow-up shot 28 days later, it said.

Those who received both shots at the spa should get one more dose of the same vaccine, Pfizer after 21 days or Moderna after 28 days, the department said. Those who are unsure can wait at least 28 days and get a final shot of either Pfizer or Moderna, the department said.

The CDC does not recommend that people get more than three doses of any COVID-19 vaccine regardless of validity because of a lack of clinical data, the department said.

In announcing the investigation last week, the department said 3,933 people got vaccinations at the clinic.",,,1618670924,{},guuuyec,True,t3_mss1kx,False,True,t3_mss1kx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mss1kx/officials_advise_4000_people_vaccinated_at/guuuyec/,1618672083,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;The number of Florida seniors entering the hospital for COVID dropped sharply over the past month, an indication that the vaccination campaign begun in December has been effective in protecting the group most vulnerable to the disease.

&gt;Hospitals have registered a 46% drop in admissions for COVID patients aged 70 or over since mid-February, an encouraging sign in the fight against the pandemic. And since COVID deaths are typically preceded by hospitalizations, the drop is an indication that the death rate may continue to fall.

&gt;Warning signs remain. The hospitalization rate for younger people has begun creeping upward, paralleling a drop in the age of the average person with COVID. And while most Florida seniors have been vaccinated, many have not, and they remain vulnerable to a disease that appears to be spreading as more people venture out to restaurants, clubs and social gatherings.

No one said that, but they are willing to accept that risk. It's a treatable disease. In fact studies have shown that since PREP was introduced more cases of Gonorrhea are being identified and treated because PREP requires a screening every three months, resulting in more treatments and fewer unidentified cases. 

&gt;Yes. I do. I see it everyday outside.

You literally just said you see people packed into bars and restaurants. Obviously there isn't as big of a stigma as you would like us to believe if that's the case. 


&gt;I'm not ""trying to shame people"". I'm just pointing out objective facts. 


No, you're not. You're using emotional pleas to try and shame people.


&gt;The hard truth is:.. A community or society cannot survive if everyone dies. 


Emotional plea, and logical fallacy. Everyone will not die, even if we let this virus run rampant without any mitigation strategies that wouldn't happen. 


&gt;Anything less than that is just saying ""We don't care if people die a slow horrible (preventable) death.""


Another emotional plea that is ignoring many different aspects of the pandemic. If a person is eating in a restaurant, working with the public, or seeing friends, that doesn't mean they are taking NO precautions, it means they have identified a level of risk they're willing to take to safeguard their physical health, mental health, and economic circumstances.

For companies that agreed to sell vaccines at cost, the so-called indemnity protections were fairly generous. Those seeking a profit would have to fend more for themselves.

In fact they did worse, they covered liability for AstraZeneca but made Biontech/Pfizer &amp; Moderna pay up for side effects.  Which to my mind, made the whole issue of liability more idealogical than actually a practical measure to ensure vaccine quality.

No, I point out that:

1. BBC is being disingenuous by quoting the poll is a slightly different way that altered the meaning, then completely forgetting about CanSino's viral vector vaccine and only discussing the other three vaccines under the umbrella term ""Chinese vaccines"". Maybe you should stop using that media outlet as your single source of information.
2. ""Garbage"" is your own word, that Gao Fu guy didn't use it. Besides, bring up the quality of BBC reporting it's not clear if he was talking about all four vaccines or only about the inactivated ones (considering that further in the article they talk only about the inactivated).
3. You're extrapolating the words of Chinese healthcare authorities about the  Chinese vaccines on Russian vaccines.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A vaccine that has a bit over 50% efficacy and can't be used to reach heard immunity is not garbage and and stating so is ""extreme"". Right. 

My understanding is that it has 50% efficacy at completely preventing COVID and in the other 50% it reduces the severity of the disease, which is while far from being ""great"" isn't ""garbage"" either, I'd call it ""satisfactory"" or ""will do for now"". To quote the article about Chile you yourself linked:

&gt;*But Prof Bueno, who analyses scientific data from trials with the CoronaVac, is adamant that the data shows that it works.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*She says in the trial that showed an efficacy rate of around 50% many of those who got infected only had very mild symptoms or were asymptomatic. She stresses that the important thing is that no-one in the trial needed to go into intensive care.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*She insists CoronaVac prevents deaths and severe illness and is also proving effective against the Brazilian variant.*

Although, it's BBC again so it would be better to read her original statement.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We are talking here about two authoritarian countries that have a bad track record regarding transparency, human rights 

1. What does it have to do with the pharmaceutical capabilities?
2. Besides being ""authoritarian countries that have a bad track record regarding transparency, human rights and putting politics ahead of the health of their own people"" what can you provide to support your statement that Russian vaccines are ""garbage and dangerous"" based on the low efficacy of Chinese vaccines? Also, you still haven't shown any corroborating evidence to support the ""dangerous"" part even about Chinese vaccines.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; testing vaccines on infants is beyond sick 

How do you ensure that a drug works in infants without testing it on infants?

Don't know what's the process is in China (don't care either), but in Russia it's done in the following manner: first a vaccine is tested in adults, then after the safety and efficacy have been established the trials on underage people can commences, they're conducted in several stages each one involving progressively younger subjects (I think it starts with ""14 - 17"" group and ends with ""under 2"" group).",,,1618661320,{},guu820z,False,t3_ms3r19,False,True,t1_gutrf86,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ms3r19/only_8_million_russians_vaccinated_against/guu820z/,1618661332,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

People deleting their posts happens annoyingly often when discussing controversial topics. Some people just regularly delete their whole account history too. I like having the context in my posts. I'm old fashioned. Nothing personal.

&gt; But seriously this logic can just be extended as long as you want it to. This whole “bare minimum” thing is just a cop out. 

I disagree on the bare minimum. I don't feel it's a burden to wear a mask when in public. But I accept that can be an opinion where I probably won't ever understand the other side.

&gt; There has to be a point where we collectively decide to get back to normal because Covid is something that we need to learn to live with.

I mean, there's plenty of places in the world where it got low enough that they could drop the mandates. I just don't see us being there yet. I'd rather push harder earlier and then enjoy a higher quality of life when we can drop the mandates. 

The problem is that not wearing a mask during a pandemic restricts the freedom of people who can't risk being in spaces with higher risks. Unless you do something like vaccine passports/papers where one could have the freedom not to associate with those people, which I suspect you would agree is significantly worse than asking people to just wear masks.

However, that had the potential to risk an even higher death count than the 3 Million globally (so far). Instead, in the US State I live in, our health officials mandated strict quarantine which allowed hospital not to get inundated, but this did prolong the virus's effect in the community. This was not entirely negative, since the medical community and scientists were also able to learn what was working (and what was not) from those earlier cases and apply best practices to those later COVID cases.

  
In the meantime, scientists were also able to develop the vaccines which will help with herd immunity. So, instead on relying only on infections to produce herd immunity, we have the benefit of the vaccines as well. We can avoid the death rate of the 1918 flu (which infected 1/3 of the world's population) and was estimated to have killed between 20 to 50 Million.

According to contract language Vanity Fair has obtained, the agreements with Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Janssen state: “The Government may not use, or authorize the use of, any products or materials provided under this Project Agreement, unless such use occurs in the United States” or U.S. territories.

&gt;The clauses in question are designed to ensure that the manufacturers retain liability protection, but they have had the effect of projecting the Trump administration’s America First agenda into the Biden era. “That is what has completely and totally prohibited the U.S. from donating or reselling, because it would be in breach of contract,” said a senior administration official involved in the global planning effort. “It is a complete and total ban. Those legal parameters must change before we do anything to help the rest of the world.”

Those platelets get used up before the body can make more. So these patients wind up with both the rare clots and low levels of blood platelets.

&gt;Of 23 patients who received AstraZeneca’s jab and had symptoms of clots or low platelets, 21 tested positive for antibodies to PF4, researchers report April 16 in the New England Journal of Medicine. Of those, 20 people developed blood clots. The finding adds to previous studies that found the same antibodies in additional patients who got AstraZeneca’s shotand had the dangerous clots.

...

&gt;Because we are aware of this syndrome… we know how to treat it,” says Jean Connors, a clinical hematologist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston who was not involved in the studies. And unlike the people who developed the clots before officials pinpointed the link, “we can diagnose it faster and treat it more appropriately if it does happen, so that the outcomes will be better.”

&gt;That’s because the vaccine-induced clots are similar to a condition called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, or HIT. Patients with HIT develop blood clots when treated with the commonly used anti-coagulant drug heparin. Heparin attaches to the PF4 protein, and some people develop an immune response that attacks the two molecules.

...

&gt;Health care workers can test for PF4. And if a patient tests positive, there are many other anti-coagulants other than heparin that clinicians can use for treatment, Connors says.

&gt;  
&gt;BBC  is being disingenuous by quoting the poll is a slightly different way  that altered the meaning, then completely forgetting about CanSino's  viral vector vaccine and only discussing the other three vaccines under  the umbrella term ""Chinese vaccines"". Maybe you should stop using that  media outlet as your single source of information.

""forgetting"" ... right because the three others are on the market around the globe and are so relevant. Perhaps you should stop discrediting the messenger and actually concentrate on the relevant content. And we both know that the BBC is not the only one that did report on that. [https://apnews.com/article/china-gao-fu-vaccines-offer-low-protection-coronavirus-675bcb6b5710c7329823148ffbff6ef9](https://apnews.com/article/china-gao-fu-vaccines-offer-low-protection-coronavirus-675bcb6b5710c7329823148ffbff6ef9) Discredit this. ;)

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""Garbage"" is your own word, that Gao Fu guy didn't use it. Besides,  bring up the quality of BBC reporting it's not clear if he was talking  about all four vaccines or only about the inactivated ones (considering  that further in the article they talk only about the inactivated).

And more revitalizations, BBC bashing and because Gao Fu didn't use the word ""garbage"" it means it is not garbage. Got it. Since you put so much effort in defending what Gao Fu said, have you missed the part where he stated that he wanted to combine many vaccines? Why would anyone do that if they weren't garbage.

&gt;My understanding is that it has 50% efficacy at completely preventing  COVID and in the other 50% it reduces the severity of the disease, which  is while far from being ""great"" isn't ""garbage"" either, I'd call it  ""satisfactory"" or ""will do for now"". To quote the article about Chile  you yourself linked:

 So no herd immunity and you vaccinate 50% for nothing so that they some of them later on eventually die or allow them to produce more mutants that screw up the other 50%. Very humane and totally logical because.... garbage vaccines. Yep.

Lastly once again you are confused about the basics on how tests for COVID-19 work. The link you have explicitly says the PCR tests are not good at catching illness the first days after exposure. Think about it : I am exposed on day one, and am on the way to getting sick. It will be some time for the virus to replicate enough to be captured in a PCR test.

I am amazed at how much the government is entering into everyone’s lives here in Canada. I’ve seen statistics say that the majority of reduction in cases results from voluntary quarantine. It would seem as though many Canadians are extremely compliant with this. So Canada issues a mandatory hotel stay.

Canadians are going to parks because it’s finally starting to get warm up here and the winter had been depressing as fuck. So what does Canada do (or Quebec in this case)? Issue an 8pm curfew to keep people inside and patrol the parks with loads of cops. Wonderful, now we have a full on police state.

She also claimed they were not properly reporting deaths because they didn’t count out-of-state residents who died in Florida. I’m not sure what to make of this—I don’t know other states’ policies. Jones made her own dashboard to rival the state’s. Her dashboard had much higher infection numbers because it also included people who tested positive for antibodies but never tested positive for COVID. I’m not aware of any state that has included this cohort in their infection numbers.

The second part of this controversy is a recent study that found Florida’s excess deaths were much high than reported COVID deaths. Find me a state where this isn’t true. In most cases—all cases I can think of except for New York’s nursing homes—this is not intentional. Some people die of COVID without testing positive.

I moved home across state lines during the pandemic because of job loss and breaking up with my live-in partner.

I got an waste preventions shot, the week after I started a new job in the different state. I stopped paying HMO insurance and had a few weeks to pick my new insurance and still have coverage for that pervious month. 

They told me they needed an insurance number which I did not have. I thought about giving my expired insurance number (they don't drop you from coverage until 30days nonpayment so I could have gone back and paid another $400 one more time to get this shot) 

 But I worried billing that old insurance would flag I'm out of state and I would lose coverage or flag any other benefit I was receiving just before that period. 

They billed the government, but I also had to prove I lived in Idaho with my address on a bill because my drivers license was a CA ID. Thank god I still get some mail to my parent's home.

Canada should instead double down on its whole kindness thing. Instead of cops going through parks and kicking people’s drinks over in the name of preserving the law, they should be handing out masks and politely suggesting distancing for people that are too close. They should be installing port-a-potties throughout all the parks to account for the immense demand, as the parks are literally the only place to go once it gets sunny. Right now we have the police versus the citizens, it should never work like that. 

As for the hotel stay, it seems more like political theater, just like the curfew. Both mandates increase the density of people in areas.

The young, while in cases potentially suffering lasting damage, are far less likely to be hurt. In every state the very strong trend is towards opening things back up. You may see many states retain mask mandates, but mask mandates have less of an impact on economic life than having places be shut or half-shut.

But vaccinating young adults is extremely wise and I highly doubt we'll regret the effort to do so. The new variants do not seem more deadly on an individual basis than the original strain but they do seem more transmittable, and we are seeing high transmission among younger persons. That causes some measure of health damage, both to young persons who unlucky enough to be impacted as well as unvaccinated older people for whom younger people are essentially the vehicle of transmission.

Moreover, whether you consider it rational or not, there is a large population of vaccinated people who are cautious about getting fully back into prior economic and social life. Some of this is time; it's a crazy year. But having high case numbers--even if deaths continue to decline--can spook them out and keep them a bit more inside for a bit longer.

J&amp;J official says an unusual blood clot event was reported in vaccine trial

From CNN's Jacqueline Howard

At least one vaccine trial volunteer also developed unusual blood clots after getting Johnson &amp; Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine, a top official for the company said Wednesday. 

Dr. Aran Maree, chief medical officer for J&amp;J’s vaccine arm Janssen, said blood clots were seen in two patients in Phase 3 vaccine trials – one who got vaccine and one who was given a placebo shot. 

Maree also detailed a seventh possible case to an emergency meeting of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

There was one case of the concerning type of blood clot, known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), in September, during the Phase 3 trial of the single-dose vaccine, Maree said. It involved a 25-year-old white man who has recovered. Plus, a 59-year-old woman developed a series of blood clots known as deep vein thromboses or DVTs. 

The company is looking for more possible cases, Maree said.

""There is also an ongoing study, a large open label study, in South African health care professionals. This has enrolled currently, 272,438 participants,"" Maree said. ""We have had no reports of CVST. We have had one case of pulmonary embolism.""

A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot in the lung.”[vaccine updates CNN](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-04-14-21/h_1e77b27b21517d3dfb2d53c093716563)",,,1618673821,{},guv3ort,True,t3_msnxut,False,True,t1_guv2w0j,/r/Coronavirus/comments/msnxut/we_were_flying_blind_a_drs_account_of_a_womans_jj/guv3ort/,1618676111,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
