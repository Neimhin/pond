Nurses have been resigning in large numbers because they are exhausted, because the hospital cannot replace the staff who are resigning, leaving the remaining ones with an even worse work load, and because agencies are recruiting nurses to work elsewhere on contracts at very high pay, often higher pay than doctors'.

Another reason hospitals are losing staff is because in this surge, the patients have become very hostile, spurred by dangerous propaganda that promotes ideas such as that doctors and nurses are killing people with Covid.  In many locations, numerous HCWs have been physically assaulted over the past few months. This did not occur last year. 

It is odd that the death rate is higher now, because the average age of hospitalized patients is younger than during the surge last year. Last year, a majority of patients were older. Now they tend to be younger, because a much larger percentage of older people in Florida are vaccinated.

Did you read the article?

&gt;On Aug. 31, Israel registered 11,000 new Covid-19 cases, the highest daily number since the pandemic began. The worrying thing was: That day‚Äôs case count beat a record set in mid-January, when only a small proportion of Israel‚Äôs population had been vaccinated.  
&gt;  
&gt;By the end of August, at least 68% of Israelis had received at least one vaccine dose, but even the vaccinated were falling sick enough to need hospitalization. Alarmed, the Israeli government set about administering booster shots, trying to contain a surge in cases driven largely by the Delta variant of the coronavirus.  
&gt;  
&gt;In its speed and thoroughness, Israel‚Äôs vaccination drive was a shining model. But to other governments, Israel‚Äôs late-summer spike now presents the frightening prospect that vaccine immunity may wane quicker than expected. Most countries have been slower than Israel in inoculating their populations, so the logical conclusion seems to be that their drop-off in vaccine immunity will follow Israel‚Äôs with a similar lag. Israel‚Äôs present looms in other countries‚Äô futures. Indeed, said David O‚ÄôConnor, a professor of pathology at the University of Wisconsin, ‚ÄúI have every reason to believe that the US is already seeing a version of that same spike in cases.‚Äù",,LOW_SCORE,,1631836994,{},hd5995a,False,t3_ppdsul,False,True,t1_hd57yq1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ppdsul/france_suspends_3000_unvaccinated_health_workers/hd5995a/,1631952074.0,-8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Limited space, mostly based on how we tested back in 5th and 6th grade.  Once you got on the college track, you could stay, but it wasn't easy to do so if you hadn't been placed on it.

To show how limited opportunities were, I was a national merit scholar.  I applied for every local scholarship, I didn't even make it to the interview for more than 2 of them.  I didn't get a single one.  The competition was fierce, my school didn't weight grades, and since 4.0 was the highest we got at my school, and most other ones weighted grades and 4.something was the highest, I was not alone in the inability to get scholarships.   I was 8th in my class because of my math scores, out of 125.  The opportunity I didn't have?  Was a math teacher who didn't mock my every question and make it clear that girls couldn't do math.

I had friends who didn't have the opportunities I did or how to overcome their setbacks..  I had friends that had to work so that they could eat, and that meant they couldn't study like I could.  I knew to find another teacher to help me when the math teacher was too sexist to teach me, and because I was awesome at math, the physics teacher was willing to put 20 minutes aside every morning to help me, but it's not like that teacher had 20 minutes for every student.  The ones that hadn't realized adults were useless (which I knew because I came from an abusive home and knew reporting awful adult behavior wouldn't do anything) tried to talk to the administration first, and lost out of the opportunity to get help outside the system.  I desperately needed that help, no amount of studying could get me a B without someone to explain the book to me in different words.  

I got out, I got away, and I realize fully that took not only effort but luck.

In your case, I couldn't have taken advantage of that program.  There is no way my mother would have given approval for me to go off to college before I turned 18.  A class here and there, where I couldn't live on campus, no way.

Look, I watched a friend of mine get put into the vocational track.  She started out with me, in the highest reader group, but she had issues reading, her parents didn't care about her academics as long as she was home after school to watch her siblings so they could work, and it was easier to believe the lie that she was just stupid than to fight family and school for the help she needed to stay on the advanced track.  I watched her go for highest reading group, to normal track to classes who didn't graduate took, and was overjoyed when she tested into vocational track.  I will always wonder what learning disability she had, because I could help with math, but nothing I did helped with reading.

No, not everyone has the same opportunities that they might appear to have on paper.  Could every kid register for a college prep course?  Not really.

You may be right, but if you are going to argue with someone about how masks work, you could at least be correct. Masks don't work like a sieve that only lets through particles above a certain size. Instead good masks work by making particles stick to the fibers. The chance a particle sticks to the mask depends on particle size (and charge). The particles sticks due to intermolecular forces.

Large particles are often so big that they indeed just fly through in an almost straight line and impact mask fibers with a high probability, sticking to them.

The smallest airborne particles behave erratically with an almost gas-like behaviour (Brownian motion). They move around so randomly in all directions that the chance that they stick to a fiber becomes very high as well.

Medium-sized particles are actually filtered less efficiently, because they don't quite move in a straight line, and only a bit ""randomly"". This actually makes it more likely for them to avoid touching mask fibers while passing through a mask. Good masks overcome this issue by having electrically charged fibers, which attract the remainder of particles sneaking through this range of inefficiency. 

Your argument implicitly says masks work like a sieve, and it's just wrong.",,,,1631871215,{},hd6s424,False,t3_pppomg,False,False,t1_hd5vjfp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pppomg/no_kids_cant_be_harmed_wearing_masks_to_protect/hd6s424/,1631980298.0,15,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incidentally I **do** wonder if there will be developmental impacts (especially in younger children) from the combination of lockdowns and ""hidden faces"" from masks. Most facial expression recognition occurs at very young ages (in fact, most 5 year olds score about as highly as adults - which is kind of crazy and shows how embedded facial expression is instinctually) so it probably won't be an issue, but I am at least scientifically curious if there will be a measurable impact in the cohorts most affected by COVID mitigation measures.

Will these cohorts have less facial expressions themselves, will they be less able to read other's faces, or will they have downstream impacts like lower ability to express empathy? It's completely unclear but I am sure there will be tons of studies on this in the not-so-distant future. Natural experiments like this are great ways to understand human psychology and development. 

To be clear, until children can be vaccinated (and are required to do so), there is no question on mask mandates - it's a no brainer within school at this time. The practical alternative is to go back to full time virtual learning. 

But no one talks about that implication; it's dumb crap like CO2 concentration which is stupid in the context of masks. But again, incidentally, it is actually a valid topic in schools relevant to both COVID *and* overall. Most schools have crap ventilation which results in more conduciveness to spread and higher CO2 concentrations.

[],,Ultenth,,,[],,,,text,t2_3jwrn,False,False,,"Ventilators actually have an almost 500 year history behind them, but I guess it depends on what you define as a ventilator. If you were to have specifically ""modern ventilators"" that wouldn't have been inaccurate though. Since that wasn't really regularly available until around the 1950's, before which availability, technology, and techniques related to it was pretty limited. But the overall timeline is actually very long, and kind of interesting (at least to me). 

* The concept of mechanically assisted ventilation was first published in Andreas Vesalius's Fabrica in 1543, where he also specifically mentioned tracheal external introduction of air. 

* The first recorded attempt of ‚Äúmechanical‚Äù ventilation was in 1550, attributed to Paracelsus, when he used a fire bellows as a device connected to a tube inserted in the patient‚Äôs mouth to blow air into the lungs to assist breathing.

* The first tracheostomy assisted vent attempt was 100 years later by Robert Hooke on dogs in 1667.

* Then a few years later John Mayow invented the first external negative pressure ventilation, which was basically a bellows and a bladder in 1673. He also was the first to recognize how important oxygen was to living, though he didn't name it (it wasn't fully realized as a concept and discovered till just over 100 years later).  It wasn't until 150 years later that others would also try negative pressure ventilation regularly. 

*  Internal oxygen assistance (mouth to mouth to be precise) wasn't heard of until W.A. Tossach in 1732. 

*  John Hunter in 1776 introduce the concept of a double bellows assisted ventilation to pull ""bad air"" out and push ""good air"" in. 

* The first try at pure oxygen introduced through a tracheostomy was again done by a veterinarian, E. Coleman in 1802. He also added in the first use of electrical heart stimulation, but this use of trach assisted internal oxygen assistance, chest compression external assistance, and electrical stimulation combined was all overlooked until around 100 years later. 

* The 1830's through the 1920's was a gradual progression of various forms of ventilation, mostly focused on negative pressure ""Iron Lung"" type devices, starting with John Dalziel in 1832 and ending with the Drinker-Shaw electrical iron lung in 1928, 10 years after the Flu outbreak, to be used in the various future polio outbreak. Until this most forms were unwieldy, expensive, and had various levels of effectiveness. 

* 1907 was the first real mechanical positive pressure ventilator ""The Pulminator"" by Heinrich Dr√§ger and his son Bernhard. It was not widely adopted at all though. 

So yeah, at the time of the 1918 outbreak there was scattered fairly unadvanced forms of negative pressure ventilation, and minimal or non-existent use of tracheotomy and positive pressure ventilation (which was around by not widely accepted). Basically the first really accessible and successful form related to what would be considered modern negative pressure mechanical ventilation wasn't until after the outbreak. (But it was around to be very helpful for the polio outbreaks that occurred between 1930's-50's)

To finish the timeline for anyone curious:

* Over 400 years after it was first mentioned by Andreas Vesalius, the first modern recorded Tracheotomy assisted positive pressure ventilation was done by Bj√∏rn Ibsen in 1952. This introduced it as a reliable option in the modern medical toolbox. 

* The first TRULY modern medical respirator was in 1957, with the Bird Mark 7 by Forrest Bird. 

* In 1971 we have the SERVO 900 by Bj√∂rn Jonson that combined previous advancements into the first small, quiet, reliable, effective and mostly importantly volume adjustable respirator. 

* In 1982 with new microprocessors we saw the first waveform monitored breathing ventilator with the Dr√§ger EV-A. 

* In 2000 the Massachusetts Medical Society changed the concept of how much oxygen (tidal volume) should be introduced during ventilation (lowering the amount pretty dramatically), which significantly increased effectiveness of the process. 

Which brings us more or less into the modern techniques and technology behind modern ventilation as we know it today. It's definitely FAR more effective than it was in the past, absolutely, but it's the combination of almost 500 years of advancement. They definitely made a huge difference in the Covid pandemic, but to say that they didn't have ventilators at all in 1918 isn't fully accurate.",,,,1631879042,{},hd72bmn,False,t3_ppo9ow,False,True,t1_hd5zrfz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ppo9ow/the_coronavirus_death_toll_is_approaching_the/hd72bmn/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,28769cc238398cff18bf439d757aa9f9b6131e50,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1631879053.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

There are possibilities that some people had undetected, and maybe as yet untriggered autoimmune dysfunction.   That happens, ppl go through life and then something sets it off and it flares up and you get diagnosed.  

Or, there are possibilities that the virus, itself, as it‚Äôs being destroyed and chomped on by our fighting cells, has pieces that are very similar to some protein that is human, too, and in programming white blood cells to attack that virus bit it ends up attacking us, too.

[],,annoyedatlantan,,,[],,,,text,t2_f1901,False,False,[],"United was the leader here. They announced a true vaccine mandate a month before Delta announced their gentle stick ($200/month insurance surcharge). 

And shortly after that, United doubled down on their mandate by saying that anyone with an exception (religious or medical) would not be able to work as a front line customer-facing employee and would be put on paid (for medical) or unpaid (for religious exemption) leave until the pandemic materially subsided (presumably more like June case loads). 

In fairness, United has ""geographically favorable"" conditions to mandate vaccines in terms of where most of their employees reside. Their corporate offices and hubs are predominately in cities and regions that are more pro-vaccine (e.g., Chicago, Newark, San Francisco, Washington D.C.). Delta is headquartered in Atlanta and have their Atlanta mega-hub (which makes every other US-based airline hub look tiny - the next largest hub is American's DFW hub which is still only 2/3rds the size of Delta's Atlanta ops). While Atlanta should not be confused in any way, shape, or form with rural Georgia in terms of political and scientific tilts, it is still far less vaccinated than a San Francisco or Chicago. 

Vaccine mandates are the way, especially for airline employees. It's incredible that American has been pretty much crickets during this.

It's not like a vitamin pill, where not taking it gives you 0 change, and taking it gives you some potential benefit plus some potential harm. In those situations I would agree that more research is needed.

This current situation with a deadly global pandemic however, already has a very harmful ground state. It means by default if we don't approve the booster, which is the ground state, that the virus is out there infecting people and killing people in break through cases. We are already shooting ourselves in the left foot by not approving the shots, all the while worrying about the probability vthat our right food will be shot in the future.

And we know that antibody level and protection levels drop over time. And we have safety data from the 1st + 2nd shot that is taken 21 days / 30 days apart. We have data from Isreal where it's shown that protection vis restored after the booster. We have plenty of data to make reasonable interpretation against an ongoing active harm to our population. It's just not data in the perfect form.

The biggest logical fallacy that we are seeing here is that some people seem to think not doing anything additional is not introducing harm, therefore when there isnt perfect data those people think this is a safe default action to take. But that is wrong. In the hospital, when a patient is going into cardiac arrest while it's not clear what's causing their illness, doctors don't just wait for more diagnosis. They immediately start CPR, inject drugs, and etc to try to bring the patient back. Even if they cracked some ribs in the process, or later finding out they should have done something different once they found the true cause. Because during an active harm situation, not doing anything is not the safer option.

In the current situation, not doing anything in itself is harming the public.",,,,1631915001,{},hd9bdbq,False,t3_pq6ejw,False,True,t1_hd98p8s,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pq6ejw/livestream_fda_meeting_to_discuss_the_need_for/hd9bdbq/,,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,7a73880ac5fe4fb4ccbb4bfa7837deb158c7d803,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1632167077.0,False,r/Coronavirus,public,

As more people get vaccinated, eventually the number of those hospitalized are going to be the vaccinated. But, again from your article you originally posted, vaccinated are doing wayyyy better even when hospitalized.

Here, from the title and sub title of the article you just posted illustrating the disproportionate people dying that are unvaccinated compared to vaccinated:

&gt;Nursing home aides ‚Äî the staff members who provide the most direct care to residents ‚Äî were the least likely to be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus by mid-July, according to a new analysis of U.S. facilities.  
      
&gt;The study underscores the influence that [President Biden‚Äôs new federal mandate](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/19/health/coronavirus-nursing-homes-vaccination.html ""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/19/health/coronavirus-nursing-homes-vaccination.html"") for all health care workers may have on populations like the elderly in nursing homes who are vulnerable to coronavirus infections, experts say.

&gt;The findings are ‚Äúalarming and reason for pause,‚Äù said Brian McGarry, a health researcher at the University of Rochester and one of the authors of the analysis, which appeared in a [research letter](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.5890?guestAccessKey=fac0fbdc-8a2e-4613-b76d-5bf2d884821c&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=091621 ""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.5890?guestAccessKey=fac0fbdc-8a2e-4613-b76d-5bf2d884821c&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=091621"") in JAMA Internal Medicine on Thursday.  
         
&gt;Low vaccination rates among nursing home workers in some areas have fueled concern about fresh [outbreaks](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/04/health/nursing-homes-vaccine-delta-covid.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article ""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/04/health/nursing-homes-vaccine-delta-covid.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article"") among staff and residents in these facilities, even with high numbers of vaccinated residents. Covid deaths among nursing home staff and residents accounted for [nearly one third](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-nursing-homes.html ""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-nursing-homes.html"")  of the nation‚Äôs pandemic fatalities as of June 1, and vaccination rates among staff average around 63 percent, according to the latest [federal data](https://data.cms.gov/covid-19/covid-19-nursing-home-data ""https://data.cms.gov/covid-19/covid-19-nursing-home-data"").  
          
&gt;But slightly under half of the certified nursing assistants were fully vaccinated, according to the analysis, which looked at federal vaccination data through July 18.

Back on Sept 8th, I noticed that the total deaths from COVID in Florida (according to worldometers) for the day before had jumped a bunch over the weekend prior despite low numbers of deaths reported. I only noticed because over the weekend, the total ended with ""234"" - a nice, sequential number. I made note of it because it had gone from 46,234 to 46,971 but the ""official daily death toll"" was less than 100. Seemed odd how the total # of deaths could jump that much without new deaths being reported.

Five days later (9/13), I checked the ""historical"" number for 9/7/21 again. It was now up to 48, 584. And yet, Florida's official daily death toll has still been low every day. I checked again on 9/14 and the number for 9/7 had climbed to 49,077. I checked again a few minutes ago (9/16) and the total number of deaths on 9/7/21 is now being reported as 50,205. Over the course of 8 days (9/8 to 9/16), there has been an increase in the total deaths as of 9/7 due to COVID of 3,971, but the official daily numbers being reported don't reflect that.

The body is *super* complex and there are just too many variables to be confident in the theory that dosage size is the primary factor for Moderna's comparative performance advantage.  Maybe Moderna's vaccine more closely resembles the delta variant.  Since Pfizer has gotten into more people (at least where I live) that might have put pressure on the virus to evolve to better evade Pfizer.  It could be stuff I didn't think of, a combination of all three, or maybe the larger dose *is* better.

That's why this death rate increase is surprising - we have a much younger group getting severely ill and dying.

And the tourist attractions, well those were attracting people last year too, and some were getting sick. But not nearly as many as this year. And many of those travelers are vaccinated now.

And that this standard should hold regardless of the status of society at large.

Again, your barking up the wrong tree here. Ive been Vaccinated for months. Very much Pro Vaccine. I am however extremely ideologically opposed to any form of mandate though. 

I dont mind a mask mandate because you can take that off. 

You cannot remove a vaccine from your body. 

It doesnt matter if its a beneficial substance or a negative one. Everyone should get to choose. Full stop. 

I stand by what I said. The unvaccinated (especially those who are simply recovering and dont go to a hospital or doctor) are mostly minding their own business and living as we all have for years. 

Yes, there is strain on the hospitals, but Id argue that's a failing of capitalism and the way the US does Health Care, not the fact choice is (or should) be involved. It also doesnt undermine choice in my eyes. 

And again, we arent considering Natural Immunity. I could prove an infection dating back to late last year - a full 4 1/2 -ish months before I got Vaccinated this year. Should people like me in that regard be given an out if we can progw we already recovered, recognizing we already have better protection than any Vaccine offers? Yes. I think we should. 

Pro Vaccine. Pro Mask Mandate. Anti-Vaccine Mandate.

At the end of the day, I chose to get Vaccinated because I wanted the extra protection. I still want others to be able to make that choice. Nobody else in what little family I have (who do live in Texas btw, I don't, but sometimes visit) has had it, and honestly, I respect that choice. 

The best thing to do in my eyes is drop the mandate, drop all restrictions, and ask everyone one last time if they are Vaccinated or not. 

If so, great. You have more protection than those who don't. If not, equally great. That's your personal life choice, and you very well likely have immunity from past infection that does better than the Vaccine alone anyway. 

At that point, we collectively move on, and learn to treat this as an illness that comes around once or twice a year like the Flu, since theres almost no way this doesnt become endemic at this point anyway.

But regards to anything else, obviously you are wrong. You have to be realize that it is not about ""managing to vaccinate"" in Sweden they decided to start later because that was seen as the right timing for Sweden. I personally think that is stupid, but that is the decision. 

""A hypothetical scenario based on very outdated knowledge. But many Swedish ‚Äúexperts‚Äù have been chockingly unwilling to accept research from other countries.""

Yes. I think this is fair. But it has not been consensus in Sweden until the last couple of weeks that the illness is dangerous for children. I agree that this was known before. It really seems as if the leading experts always are three to four months the rest of the world in understanding. This is what I mean with (overly) long term thinking: They don't think it matters if you are wrong a few month, since they only look at ten years. But I guess it is only true when you say and wrong when I say it.  

""I believe you are mistaken. And when you compare with Norway you are coincidentally ignoring the other Nordic countries Finland and Denmark who acted very early compared to the European average. The idea other countries healthcare is less ‚Äúindividual‚Äù seem to be only based on prejudice.""

I could be wrong in the general case. I am only judging from the current debate, where we have seen in Sweden very worried opinion pieces by respected experts who are otherwise pro vaccine being super worried that any child would get the vaccine with the intent to limit spread. They vaccines are good, they know the science, they know that kids can get ill, but they are super worried over the act of giving vaccine to kids to limit spread. This was as late as two weeks ago.

The CDC stopped tracking non-hospitalized breakthroughs before delta even hit, so we have no idea what the real numbers are. That makes it impossible to compare outcomes of vaccinated breakthroughs vs the general unvaccinated population. 

This is difficult to track because we don't have the testing capacity to check every person in the country on a regular basis for COVID. We know that at least 40 million people have had COVID, but the real infection count could be 50-100% higher. This is why we depend on studies that look at subsets of the population and extrapolate from there.

&gt; hospitalization probability has always been relatively low, even for the unvaccinated

Where do you get this idea? Almost 3 million people have been hospitalized with COVID since Aug 2020, [which is when the CDC started tracking](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#new-hospital-admissions). There were obviously many hospitalizations before that so over 1% of the entire US population has been hospitalized with COVID at this point and we're still averaging 11k new admissions per day. When is the last time we had a disease cause something like that? Even the most bleak estimates for vaccine efficacy would turn this pandemic into an average flu season.

We definitely need good public policy, but that's not going to prevent something as contagious as COVID from running rampant in an unvaccinated population. Half the population will barely tolerate masks while shopping, so anything more restrictive is doomed to failure.

Same in fx Denmark and most other countries. And still they managed to start vaccinating 12-15 in July. 


&gt; in Sweden the consensus among medical professionals is that it is always morally wrong to vaccinate with the goal to lower spread. 

This is in no way unique to Sweden. 


&gt; Earlier in the pandemic there was an opinion that children never got seriously ill. 

We‚Äôre no longer early in the pandemic and this has turned out to be completely wrong. And fx the risk of myocarditis is about 6x higher from Covid infection than from the vaccine.  


&gt; In such a situation vaccination of children would have been only made to limit spread and would have been impossible in Sweden....There hase already been quite a few of these opinion pieces in Sweden filled with anger predicated on the fact that there might be vaccination of kids only to limit spread!

A hypothetical scenario based on very outdated knowledge. But many Swedish ‚Äúexperts‚Äù have been chockingly unwilling to accept research from other countries. 


&gt; Now there is clear evidence on long COVID for a large portion of kids, so now the the Swedish health agencies can clearly make the case that the vaccination is done specifically to increase safety for the individual child.

This evidence has existed for a long time by now. 


&gt; But outside of the Nordic countries the debate seems to be different, perhaps the view on vaccination in the medical profession is different elsewhere. It seems to me that the view in healthcare is a bit more individual here than in other areas (I could be wrong.).

I believe you are mistaken. And when you compare with Norway you are coincidentally ignoring the other Nordic countries Finland and Denmark who acted very early compared to the European average.

The linked article is helpful.  The most important thing to contextualize the performance is the comparator.  In this case it is the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test manufactured by Cepheid.  While this is oversimplifying the issue, at a high-level, this comparator has pretty good sensitivity.  Not the best on the market, but pretty good. When the DRUL device in the article shows good agreement to this ""on the market"" device it is encouraging.

One thing to note is that the DRUL device may have lower specificity than is common.  The specificity for PCR devices is typically in the 95-100% range while this device may be closer to 90%. There is still clinical utility for a device like this.

Select 0-17 range on the graph.

I would strongly associate ""illness"" with hospitalization.

Another metric you can look at is hospital wait times.  The wait time at Children's hospital in MN was about 2-5 hours at the peak in MN (Nov 2020).  The 7-day case rate (CDC Metric) was about 1800). 

As of right now, the CDC rating is about 280 (about 1/5th the peak level), and the wait time is 12-24 hours at that same hospital.

As is common in rural and corrupt areas, they are plagued by a lack of infrastructure, lack of medical supplies, etc. For many in these regions, when they get sick, there isn't much medical care available. I have heard three competing theories, 1) there are still cases there but testing is not available, 2) testing is there but the government is manipulating the numbers, and 3) the outbreak earlier this year was bad enough (see lack of infrastructure and care) that essentially everyone was exposed. 

In my opinion, scenario 3 is the most likely. We know the death rate and case counts in India are dramatically understated. For example, if we look at excess deaths, we see over 10x higher excess deaths than COVID deaths (for comparison the differential in the USA is around 20-30%). These regions would be expected to be the hardest hit. 

If by I-word you mean Ivermectin, NO. The science is getting to be pretty clear at this point: it does nothing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infections.  Both of the studies which pointed to a notable benefit are very questionable (one has actually been retracted due to suspected scientific fraud).

One of the issues that I think the FDA has - which is a very valid issue -   is that there is no data regarding boosters for a younger population.  A population which has (although rare)  experienced myocarditis.  So there is a valid concern about the safety/side effects of a booster in young men.     


Pfizer is asking to approve boosters for 16+, but places like Israel don't have data for younger populations.  I'm unsure if Pfizer has any data for younger populations with booster shots.  


Of course I'd argue that young health dudes need the booster the least, and in most cases, they were the last to receive the vaccine.

Massive UK study of COVID-19 cases shows that people who are jabbed have good immunity at first, but quickly become more vulnerable to the fast-spreading Delta variant.

* The efficacy of Pfizer‚Äôs coronavirus vaccine steadily declines to about 84% about six months after a second dose, according to CEO Albert Bourla.
* Data from Israel shows the waning immunity also erodes protection from severe illness.
* The vaccine‚Äôs initial studies showed it protected people 100% of the time against hospitalization, but that falls to low 90% and mid-to-high 80% after six months, he said.

A British public health study has found that protection from either of the two most commonly used COVID-19 vaccines against the now prevalent Delta variant of the coronavirus weakens within three months.It also found that those who get infected after receiving two shots of either the Pfizer-BioNTech (22UAy.DE) or the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccine may be of greater risk to others than under previous variants of the coronavirus.

A group of doctors got together to work on early covid treatments, back when we didn‚Äôt have a vaccine and we were just throwing stuff at the wall hoping it would stick. One of them was big on treating this virus with steroids, which was originally thought to be a bad idea. It turned out adding steroids to the mix saved lives. Hospitals all over the country (and the world) started using steroids to fight covid.

This is how battling a new disease works. Throw the kitchen sink at it and figure out what is effective and what isn‚Äôt.

A bit later‚Ä¶ a doc in the group starts speculating that perhaps ivermectin would have a positive effect on covid patients. This wasn‚Äôt really well tested (most of the ‚Äústudies‚Äù on this were horribly flawed or possibly not even conducted), but it wasn‚Äôt a bad idea if you took all those bad (not peer reviewed) studies at face value. With so many people hopelessly dying, it was considered worth a shot. Ivermectin is widely available, cheap, and can be produced globally in large quantities. If it helped, even a little, it could be added to the covid protocol‚Ä¶ so those doctors who promulgated the steroid protocol started pushing ivermectin in the same way. They added it to the list of things to do to treat the extremely ill.

This, too, happened here and globally. Some countries are still pushing ivermectin as a treatment. In many of those places, vaccines aren‚Äôt easily available while horsey sauce is. Even if it doesn‚Äôt work, those people are desperate and taking it‚Ä¶ and the hospitals are administering it. In the Philippines, when they tried to do a study on the effects of ivermectin on covid, they struggled to find a control group who WASN‚ÄôT already taking ivermectin.  

The data isn‚Äôt fully in at this point (there‚Äôs still testing going on), but the data we do have seems to show the dewormer isn‚Äôt an effective treatment for covid. The first studies were horribly flawed (a long story in and of itself) and newer work shows it‚Äôs unlikely that this drug does anything to help covid patients. In the US, we largely stopped using it for that purpose because it wasn‚Äôt improving patient outcomes.

There‚Äôs where the conspiracy talk comes in. These anti-Vax people are looking for their ‚Äútruth‚Äù. They see some kind of conspiracy in all of this‚Ä¶ rather than the science behind the process. They say we‚Äôre somehow suppressing this cheap cure, but the reality is ivermectin is likely ineffective or has effects that aren‚Äôt remarkable in any way against the virus. 

As for why we‚Äôre still testing this stuff in medical studies‚Ä¶ we test all sorts of crazy drugs on diseases to see if they have a positive effect. It‚Äôs not strange for doctors to try to use ivermectin against covid. That‚Äôs how we discover new potential treatments.

It‚Äôs extremely stupid for people to go out and buy doses meant for horses that aren‚Äôt rated, tested, or dosed for human consumption.

I think child masking is another case where we can guess that covering the faces of most people children are around for much of the day could possibly have some negative effects. I think that there probably won't be much damage just because kids will still have plenty of time home and outside unmasked and they'll see faces on TV. But the concern isn't ridiculous. I would even guess that if someone had proposed studying this pre-2020 the study would have been denied due to possible health risks to the participants.

Around 5 p.m., tempers flared and the hostess stand is nearly tipped over in the mayhem, with a waiter at one point helping carry someone away from the scene.

[],,danysdragons,,,[],,,,text,t2_36453,False,False,,"The big problem we're facing with Covid is that because of how this virus behaves, there's no real selection pressure for it to become less virulent over time.

Covid suppresses the immune system's early warning system, so it's able to replicate like crazy before the immune system can react. And because most early symptoms of Covid (and most viral infections) are actually due to the immune response, not damage from the virus, a suppressed immune response mean people are wandering around without symptoms but carrying and shedding high levels of virus. By the time they experience severe symptoms, most of the transmission has already occurred. 

[Diagram Visualizing this Pattern](https://archive.is/6fOQD/7b18174deb0d2b052f0da5b62c6c6865a5526e53.jpg)

Suppose Covid undergoes mutations so that virus replicates within the body faster. That will likely make it more infectious, since more virus is being shed, and there's a good chance that the danger of serious illness and death will also be greater, because of the heavy viral load. Actually, that's exactly how many experts are characterizing the Delta variant (as you mentioned).

I found some good articles by Dr. Haseltine of Harvard Medical School talking about these issues, here's an excerpt from the second article linked below:

&gt;The moment SARS-CoV-2 infects a cell, it begins to counter both the innate and adaptive immune response. The primary target is interferon, the protein that protects the infected cell and alerts surrounding cells to the presence of an invading pathogen. Studies show that Covid-19 patients are at higher risk of severe illness and death when their ability to produce a robust interferon response is compromised.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;In other words, SARS-CoV-2 mounts a full-court press against the initiation of both the innate and adaptive immune response. This covert strategy fends off the immune reactions long enough for the virus to enter and exit before a naive or memory response kicks in.

&gt;Immune cells can learn the vagaries of a particular infectious disease in two main ways. The first is bona fide infection, and it‚Äôs a lot like being schooled in a war zone, where any lesson in protection might come at a terrible cost. Vaccines, by contrast, safely introduce immune cells to only the harmless mimic of a microbe, the immunological equivalent of training guards to recognize invaders before they ever show their face. The first option might be more instructive and immersive‚Äîit is, after all, the real thing. But the second has a major advantage: It provides crucial intel in the absence of risk.

&gt;Some pathogens aren‚Äôt memorable to the body, no matter the form in which they‚Äôre introduced. But with SARS-CoV-2, we‚Äôve been lucky: Both inoculation and infection can marshal stellar protection. Past tussles with the virus, in fact, seem so immunologically instructive that in many places, including several nations in the European Union, Israel, and the United Kingdom, they can grant access to restaurants, bars, and travel hubs galore, just as full vaccination does.

&gt;In the United States, conversely, only fully vaccinated Americans can wield the social currency that immunity affords. The policy has repeatedly come into heated contention, especially as the country barrels forward with plans for boosters and vaccination mandates. No one, it seems, can agree on the immunological exchange rate‚Äîwhether a past infection can sub in for one inoculation or two inoculations, or more, or none at all‚Äîor just how much immunity counts as ‚Äúenough.‚Äù

&gt;Even among the nation‚Äôs top health officials, a potential shift in the social status of the once-infected remains ‚Äúunder active discussion,‚Äù Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden‚Äôs chief medical adviser, told me. For now, though, he reiterated, ‚Äúit still is the policy that if you‚Äôve been infected and recovered, that you should get vaccinated.‚Äù And in the United States, which is awash in supplies of shots, some version of that policy is likely to stick. Infections and vaccinations, down to a molecular level, are ‚Äúfundamentally different‚Äù experiences, Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale, told me. Surviving a rendezvous with SARS-CoV-2 might mean gaining some protection, but it‚Äôs no guarantee.

&gt;What the experts do converge on is this: Opting for an infection over vaccination is never the right move. An unprotected rendezvous with SARS-CoV-2 ultimately amounts to taking a double gamble‚Äîthat the virus won‚Äôt ravage the body with debilitating disease or death, and that it will eventually be purged, leaving only immune protection behind. Questions linger, too, about how long such safeguards might last, and how they stack up against the carefully constructed armor of inoculation. Vaccines eliminate the guesswork‚Äîa fail-safe we‚Äôll need to keep relying on as the coronavirus persists in the human population, threatening to invade our bodies again, and again, and again.

But what happens if there is a new influenza and more virulent variant this year? Virologist says, ""I recommend influenza vaccine for everyone! Get one now!""

Problem is, we don't have enough influenza vaccine, exacerbated due to a virologist telling people not to take the vaccine last year. Now there are a bunch of deaths. Virologist shouts in his best Scotty voice, ""Jim, I'm a virologist not a supply chain manager!"" 

Policy makers have to consult with scientists, manufacturers, and healthcare representatives to make the best decisions, not just for this one moment, but for different scenarios.

It is likely safe and effective, but I agree with FDA here in that Pfizer based their submission for approval on studies that aren't peer reviewed yet.

I am honestly probably overreaching on the long flu claim; the point is, long covid is not nearly the threat it is when you're vaccinated (a claim I am not overreaching on), and long flu exists and always has existed and you never even knew about it. And people said straight from the first day the CDC said that shit that just because you can detect viral RNA in your nostrils doesn't mean you're actually spreading covid. There are myriad reasons viral RNA will wind up dead and harmless in your nose. Further, it's common knowledge now that the amount of viral RNA in your nose drops considerably faster when you're vaccinated. The idea that vaccinated people are walking around transmitting covid is unproven and largely unsupported.

The CDC has totally fucked its delivery of all of this information. The FDA has looked at all the data and decided that you don't need a booster.

I have a lot of similar frustration with the FDA on this precise topic.  At the same time, I can't help but put some of the blame on Pfizer as well.  They were the ones that went to the FDA in July to get EUA approval for our kids and the FDA told them they needed to do more clinical trials.  In this case, the FDA yet again told Pfizer they didn't have sufficient research being presented.

So I do think that in many ways the FDA is moving too slowly and perhaps keeping standards that are unrealistic in a pandemic.  However, Pfizer also has been unprepared for their requests for approval at least twice now on this highest profile thing possible.

Background:

The ABO and rhesus (Rh) blood groups may influence risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

Objective:

To determine whether ABO and Rh blood groups are associated with risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness.

Design:

Population-based cohort study.

Setting:

Ontario, Canada.

Patients:

All adults and children who had ABO blood group assessed between January 2007 and December 2019 and who subsequently had SARS-CoV-2 testing between 15 January and 30 June 2020.

Measurements:

The main study outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, determined by viral RNA polymerase chain reaction testing. A second outcome was severe COVID-19 illness or death. Adjusted relative risks (aRRs) and absolute risk differences (ARDs) were adjusted for demographic characteristics and comorbidities.

Results:

A total of 225‚Äâ556 persons were included, with a mean age of 54 years. The aRR of SARS-CoV-2 infection for O blood group versus A, AB, and B blood groups together was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.92; ARD, ‚àí3.9 per 1000 [CI, ‚àí5.4 to ‚àí2.5]). Rhesus-negative (Rh‚àí) blood type was protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection (aRR, 0.79 [CI, 0.73 to 0.85]; ARD, ‚àí6.8 per 1000 [CI, ‚àí8.9 to ‚àí4.7]), especially for those who were O-negative (O‚àí) (aRR, 0.74 [CI, 0.66 to 0.83]; ARD, ‚àí8.2 per 1000 [CI, ‚àí10.8 to ‚àí5.3]). There was also a lower risk for severe COVID-19 illness or death associated with type O blood group versus all others (aRR, 0.87 [CI, 0.78 to 0.97]; ARD, ‚àí0.8 per 1000 [CI, ‚àí1.4 to ‚àí0.2]) and with Rh‚àí versus Rh-positive (aRR, 0.82 [CI, 0.68 to 0.96]; ARD, ‚àí1.1 per 1000 [CI, ‚àí2.0 to ‚àí0.2]).

Limitation:

Persons who rapidly died of severe COVID-19 illness may not have had SARS-CoV-2 testing.

Conclusion:

The O and Rh‚àí blood groups may be associated with a slightly lower risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 illness.",,,,1631892892,{},hd7venr,True,t3_pq2fpn,False,False,t3_pq2fpn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pq2fpn/association_between_abo_and_rh_blood_groups_and/hd7venr/,1632001863.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How about instead, we compare apples to apples - look at the case rate change in SF itself, because that shows the effect of behavioral changes (which includes masking).

In San Francisco, we got down to a 7-day average of about 10 cases/day in early June. Then delta hit and we rocketed up top a peak of 309/day. But since that peack it's been dropping like a stone, with today it being down to 98/day:  
  
https://sf.gov/data/covid-19-cases-and-deaths

Anecdotally, I see a lot more mask use and other behavioral changes in SF, closer to what it was like prior to vaccines being available.

But if not behavioral changes, how can you explain the rapid drop in cases in SF over the last 1.5 months? It's not like the vaccination rate went way up in the last 1.5 months, as SF was already very vaccinated before that.

It can't be that it just burned itself out, since even the short peak is only a very small fraction of the unvaccinated population (which is around 150k-160k residents) not to mention that there are many more commuters and tourists that come into SF each day. There's not a ton of natural immunity in SF because cases have been so low for most of the pandemic compared to other places. On top of that, as you said, there's a fairly high breakthrough rate even for vaccinated people. So there is a huge number of people in SF that can still catch it.

The ONLY explanation is behavioral changes.

**Study Title:** How Does Background Noise Affect Hearing?

**Study Description:** Researchers at the UW are looking at how children learn to hear sounds like speech and music in noisy real-world environments, such as classrooms or playgrounds. *We are hoping to recruit children between the ages of 4 and 18 years of age who wear hearing aids, and also who do not wear hearing aids.* We have two options of studies: 

1. In-person study, taking place at the University of Washington Virginia Bloedel Research Center. Your child would come into the lab for an EEG recording and be asked to complete various listening tasks.

2. Online study (via Zoom). Your child will be asked to do online listening tasks on Zoom.

Post-vaccine it is likely that more from that party have died. But there are some surprising stats that do not follow this theory: look at The Villages, a huge retirement community in central Florida. It is well-known to be very red, very loyal to the man in Palm Beach. Yet the area has one of the highest vaccination rates in the state.

[],,SCWarriors44,,,[],,,,text,t2_1b59zb10,False,False,[],"It‚Äôs not so much any religion. These are personal choices or personal beliefs based on religion. Some people claim religious exemption because they are so against abortion and the use of aborted fetuses to create the vaccine that they won‚Äôt get the vaccine itself because of it. Or if they personally take the ‚Äúyour body is a temple‚Äù seriously, they may want to avoid the vaccine in fear of unknown side effects to their body, although of course the counter argument is the ill effects of Covid will also affect their body but here they chose the option in which there may be an outcome in which nothing will affect their body whereas the vaccine will 100% affect it if that makes sense. Others may believe God made them able to handle the virus and not get it for that but that wouldn‚Äôt justify a religious exemption to me at least. 

There‚Äôs honestly a handful of other religious reasons why someone could be against it because of a held belief by that person. Not so much a religious exemption but quite a lot of Christians do tend to be rather anti government or at least anti authoritarian which most governments are being currently in order to get people vaccinated so those people may be against the vaccine for that reason as well, most likely citing religious freedom in that case. Most churches are not against it and are even actively pushing for it. One dude said Dutch Reformed was against it but I grew up in the most Dutch Reformed region in the US and they have been rather for getting vaccinated. They have skepticism of course but most I know have gotten it without any coercion so I‚Äôm sure what he was on about there. 

I would say it‚Äôs not up to anyone or the government to decide if someone holds a true religious exemption or not. To that person the fear of getting the vaccine may be very real, the belief behind it could very well mean that much to them. However I agree also that some people definitely are abusing the religious freedom route too to avoid the shot.

The vaccine was famously invented by Edward Jenner near the turn of the 18th century and advanced smallpox mitigation much more than variolation. Jenner's vaccine did not cause infection, which is why it was such a breakthrough. Rather, Jenner used immunogens to induce his new concept of immune response. Variolation by contrast had induced anisotropic presentation of smallpox disease by selective infection route, and this was the method Washington ordered administered to his troops, a couple decades before Jenner demonstrated his vaccine.
____
First, variolation.

Variolation (not vaccination) had previously been used in medieval Eastern/Middle Eastern medicine and occasionally in the West. In 1706 Onesimus of west Africa introduced variolation to Cotton Mather of Massachusetts Bay province. Mather further read of it in research published in 1714 by Turkish physician Emmanuel Timoni. In 1721 Mary Wortley Montagu introduced to Britain a program for smallpox variolation. That same year Mather implemented it in Boston. It was a technique for infection with a mild load of contagion by dermal route, which produced less severe disease than inhalation.

In 1766 Bernoulli (yes, *that* Bernoulli) made a contemporary [analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rmv.443) of comparative advantage and calculated that universally inoculating with variola would reduce mortality with the base rates at the time.

In 1768 John Fewster discovered the concept of cowpox inoculation, which was a watershed moment for various researchers swiftly to attempt immunity induction, but *without smallpox variola*.

But that's all just pre-vaccine.
____
Now for vaccines.

In 1796 Edward Jenner famously tested his invention of vaccination successfully, with his publication by 1798, formalized vaccination comprehensively as a word, a method with a model for the immunology, and a vector for inoculation with more specific immunogens but without infection.

Jenner's invention was more effective and less dangerous than any intervention against disease that had ever existed before. It changed everything. Jenner's vaccine was an entirely different ball game than variolation. Spain and Napoleon both embraced use of Jenner's vaccine and realized excellent results. By 1840, Britain switched their smallpox mitigation [efforts](https://www.bmj.com/content/325/7361/430) to Jenner's vaccine entirely (Even mandating mass vaccination by act of Parliament and explicitly stopping use of variolation because the vaccine was so much better).

By 1881, after a few more decades, Pasteur advanced immunology and vaccinology significantly; when representing France at the International Medical Congress in London and lecturing about his brand new attenuation method of vaccine at a General Meeting of the Congress, [recommended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine) that newer forms of vaccine for other diseases be named vaccines in honor of Jenner's revolutionary 1798 publication. 

""I have given to the word vaccination an extension which I hope Science will consecrate as a homage to the merit and immense services rendered by your Jenner, one of England's greatest men. It is a great happiness to me to glorify that immortal name on the very soil of the noble and hospitable city of London!"" - Pasteur, August 1881^[[1]](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736\(02\)35739-8),[[2]](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.173907/page/n351/mode/2up?view=theater).",,,,1631855063,{},hd68pzs,False,t3_ppdsul,False,False,t1_hd5ffay,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ppdsul/france_suspends_3000_unvaccinated_health_workers/hd68pzs/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,1934c4d6831fb7eedc6365570b18658ef80b54e4,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1631855075.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

A priest and an altar boy are in church when they hear that a hurricane is coming over the radio. The altar boy says, ""Father, we should evacuate."" The priest says ""It's okay, God will watch over me.""

So the boy goes and the priest stays in his church. The storm hits and the water floods the church up to the priest's ankles. He hears a horn honking outside, and he looks and sees a big van. The driver rolls down the window and yells, ""Come on, Father! We have room for you in the back!"" The priest yells back ""Don't worry about me! God will watch over me!"" So the van drives away.

The storm worsens, and the water is now up to the priest's waist. He's praying when he hears the roar of a motor. When he looks outside, he sees a speedboat. The guy in the boat calls out, ""Hey Father! I was worries you were still here! Hop in, let's get out of here!"" The priest replies, ""Don't worry about me! God will watch over me!"" So the boat motors away.

The storm has gotten even worse, now. The church is filled with water, and the priest has to stand on it's roof because he doesn't know how to swim. While he's praying up there, he hears the sounds of a helicopter. He looks up and sees a bright spotlight on him. A loudspeaker on the chopper shouts out, ""Hey Father! We're dropping a rope for you! Grab onto it so that we can pull you to safety!"" The priest replies, ""Don't worry about me! God will watch over me!"" So the helicopter flies off.

The storm gets even worse, and the priest slips and falls into the water below. Not knowing how to swim, he flails until he drowns and goes to heaven. Once there, he goes and finds God. He's angry at God, and says, ""Lord, why didn't you save me!? I put my faith in you!"" God turns around with a confused look and says, ""What are you talking about? I sent a van, a boat, and a helicopter!""",,,,1631833137,{},hd51biu,False,t3_ppbf90,False,False,t1_hd3c01q,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ppbf90/hochul_says_religious_exemption_not_a_legitimate/hd51biu/,1631948189.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most COVID-19 vaccines, meanwhile, focus exclusively on the spike protein, the molecular lock pick the coronavirus uses to break into cells. And while SARS-CoV-2 first infiltrates the moist mucosal linings of the nose, mouth, and throat, where it can tickle out airway-specific immune defenses, typical COVID-19 shots are blitzed into the arm, mostly marshaling all-purpose antibodies that bop through the blood. That makes it tough for vaccinated bodies to waylay viruses at their point of entry, giving the invaders more time to establish themselves.

&gt;Some of these differences might help explain the results of a recent, buzzy study out of Israel, in which researchers reported that previously infected individuals were better protected than people who had been fully vaccinated with the Pfizer shots, including against severe cases of COVID-19. ‚ÄúAs soon as that paper came out,‚Äù Fauci told me, ‚Äúwe obviously discussed the inevitable issue‚Äù‚Äîwhether infection should be enough to exempt someone from a shot.

&gt;But Fauci, as well as most of the other experts I talked with, cautioned against overinterpreting the results of a single study, especially one documenting only a snapshot in time. Even taken at face value, the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù defenses offered by post-infection immunity come at a massive potential cost, said Goel, of the University of Pennsylvania. Cells and molecules are scrambling to learn the traits and weaknesses of a foreign invader while their home is being attacked; any infection bears some risk of hospitalization, long-term disability, or death. The virus can also interfere with the immune response, muffling antiviral defenses, severing the ties among disparate branches of immune cells, and, in some cases, even duping the body into attacking its own tissues. And unlike the vaccines, infections are, well, infectious, turning each afflicted person into ‚Äúa public-health threat,‚Äù Nahid Bhadelia, the founding director of Boston University‚Äôs Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases Policy and Research, told me.

&gt;Those who surface from these encounters seemingly unscathed might not have much immunity to show for it, either. Several studies have shown that a decent percentage of infected people might not produce detectable levels of antibodies, for the simple reason that ‚Äúnot all infections are the same,‚Äù Beatrice Hahn, a virologist at the University of Pennsylvania, told me. The immune system tends to use its own threat assessment to calibrate its memory, dismissing many brief or low-symptom encounters. That could be an especial concern for people with long COVID, many of whose initial infections were asymptomatic or mild.

&gt;At the other end of the spectrum, very severe disease can so traumatize the immune system that it fails to recollect the threat it‚Äôs fighting. Researchers have watched immune-cell training centers ‚Äúcompletely collapse‚Äù beneath the blaze of inflammation, Eun-Hyung Lee, an immunologist at Emory University, told me. In some cases, the virus might find its prior hosts nearly as unguarded as before. ‚ÄúIt would be dangerous to assume good immunity across all individuals in this group,‚Äù says Kimia Sobhani, who‚Äôs studying antibody responses to the virus at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, in Los Angeles.",,,,1631864329,{},hd6kt44,True,t3_ppqfbz,False,False,t1_hd6696u,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ppqfbz/sorry_a_coronavirus_infection_might_not_be_enough/hd6kt44/,1631976234.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is quite common to transfer patients out of state in disaster situations.  I worked for a service that had a converted Greyhound bus that was an ambulance for disasters.  My guess is that they are transferring a lot of patients out, but that there is red tape and a limited supply of aircraft.  Also this is a nationwide issue so you have to find hospitals willing to accept the patients when many areas are already struggling.  Even before Covid, I often had to take people on 4-5 hour trips because local hospitals were full, especially during flu season.  

Also, the flights are incredibly expensive.  Insurance and the medevac services may be kicking up their heels.

We probably need a national coordinating center, run by FEMA, that tracks every hospital bed in the country, so that during a national disaster any hospital can call, say ""I have a vent patient who needs to go to  a facility with room, as every bed is full and we can no longer treat major emergencies"".  And they'll send an aircraft to take someone across the country to a hospital that had room.  Right now, a nurse starts making call after call of ""Got any beds? No? K tnx bye"" until they find one, starting with hospitals they have contracts with. Then they call their contracted transport service. ""Any  planes available? No? K tnx bye"" before going down the list of airevac providers.  Which is a local list in their state, usually.

I looked up the actual NYC/SF numbers because I was curious about it.

New York County (Manhattan) has 158,992 total cases / 1.632 million population = 9.7% of population [https://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-Tracker/NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-Map?%3Aembed=yes&amp;%3Atoolbar=no&amp;%3Atabs=n](https://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-Tracker/NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-Map?%3Aembed=yes&amp;%3Atoolbar=no&amp;%3Atabs=n)

70% of all Manhattan residents are fully vaccinated: [https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/covid-19-vaccine-tracker](https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/covid-19-vaccine-tracker)

San Francisco County has 48,764 total cases / 874k population = 5.6% of the population [https://sf.gov/data/covid-19-cases-and-deaths](https://sf.gov/data/covid-19-cases-and-deaths)

73% of all San Franciscans are fully vaccinated: [https://sf.gov/data/covid-19-vaccinations](https://sf.gov/data/covid-19-vaccinations)

If you add the cases + vaccination percentages, you end up in the same place within about 1%. This assumes however that there isn't some drastic undercount in either of the infection numbers (if an undercount exists, it is more likely to occur in the NYC data, but if you read the literature it seems they've added back in a lot of ""probable"" cases from early in the pandemic).

And even if you don't buy the NYC data, go look at Monterey County or San Diego County - those summer delta curves are very similar to San Francisco (plus the counties have similar levels of natural immunity, which probably makes the point better than the comparison to NYC does).  **Those other two counties never instituted a mask mandate, and yet their cases also dropped like a rock in the last 6 weeks, just like SF.  Since cases dropped like a rock in all three counties, we can't attribute SF's drop to the mask mandate in SF.**

&gt;look at the case rate change in SF itself, because that shows the effect of behavioral changes (which includes masking).

I disagree.  This line of insular ""let's only look at SF data"" thinking is increasingly the only way that SF's continued mask mandate is justified by proponents.  My whole post was about the comparison to other metros with similar vaccination rates .  That's how science works, you set up control variables and evaluate any differences an environmental condition may cause.  Right now, in a 70%+ vaccinated population it's looking like mask mandates are no longer making any meaningful difference in case rates.

Bay area health officers grandstanded early in the pandemic and promised Covid policy based on science and data.  I would like to see them address the data showing the reduced effectiveness of mask mandates in a highly vaccinated population, and justify the continuance of such a mandate. Apparently their ""Covid policy based on science"" dog whistle was really just meant ""we're going to be as strict as possible, no matter what the data says""",,,,1631894011,{},hd7y3qi,False,t3_ppfnwm,False,True,t1_hd7uke7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ppfnwm/california_only_state_to_advance_out_of_high/hd7y3qi/,1632003299.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obviously frustrating because I think a recent year the flu killed like 30,000 in the US. I'm gonna round heavily, but let's say covid killed 500,000 in one year, in the US. That's a huge difference for anyone with a brain instead of pudding. It gets even more dire when you consider the flu took 30,000 that particular year and, like every other year, took place with absolutely zero societal or social changes or restrictions.

Life was ""normal"" when the flu was killing 30,000. We went to work sick and we'd go out to the bar afterwards to get wasted and feel a little better (this made more sense in my head when I was in my 20s. it's madness now.) and we'd expose 30 people to the flu without thinking about it.

Unfortunately I don't believe we can go back to exactly that life. If we ever get real herd immunity without people having to get sick to get their antibodies, we're going to have to manage outbreaks of this because it's overall that much deadlier than the flu. And if we need yearly booster shots then I think we're going to be stuck with these assholes that will strain the healthcare system in perpetuity. On a small scale that wouldn't work in the US, look at New Zealand. They've done pretty well, but when there are infections shit gets locked down fast. I don't see a future too different than that here, but I don't think we can do it as well for a multitude of reasons.

I'm still left searching for the answer to this, but I wonder if we were a more responsible society globally could we have eradicated something like influenza or covid? Like let's say the world is perfect and everyone working towards the same goal in a utopia. If literally every single person did their part could these viruses have been erased or is it a once the cat is out of the bag type situation?",,,,1631893874,{},hd7xs2n,False,t3_ppz0nk,False,False,t1_hd7pbpg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ppz0nk/my_dad_didnt_have_a_fighting_chance_covid_is/hd7xs2n/,1632003126.0,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The political cost in the US is much higher. Antivaxxers led a violent coup earlier this year. They conspired to kidnap and murder a governor to protest mask mandates. They stormed a state capital to reverse social distancing mandates. Many pro-mask, pro-vax libs oppose mandates. Do these mandates and you can count on losing the next election cycle.

Abstract:  
  
Evidence is emerging that exercise and physical activity provides protection against severe COVID-19 disease in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, but it is not known how exercise affects immune responses to the virus. A healthy man completed a graded cycling ergometer test prior to and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, then again after receiving an adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccine. Using whole blood SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation assays, IFN-Œ≥ ELISPOT assays, flow cytometry, ex vivo viral-specific T-cell expansion assays and deep T-cell receptor (TCR) Œ≤ sequencing, we found that exercise robustly mobilized highly functional SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells to the blood compartment that recognized spike protein, membrane protein, nucleocapsid antigen and the B.1.1.7 Œ±-variant, and consisted mostly of CD3+/CD8+ T-cells and double-negative (CD4-/CD8-) CD3+ T-cells. The magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell mobilization with exercise was intensity dependent and robust when compared to T-cells recognizing other viruses (e.g. CMV, EBV, influenza). Vaccination enhanced the number of exercise-mobilized SARS-CoV-2 T-cells recognizing spike protein and the Œ±-variant only. Exercise-mobilized SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells proliferated more vigorously to ex vivo peptide stimulation and maintained broad TCR-Œ≤ diversity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens both before and after ex vivo expansion. Neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were transiently elevated during exercise after both infection and vaccination. Finally, infection was associated with an increased metabolic demand to defined exercise workloads, which was restored to pre-infection levels after vaccination. This case study provides impetus for larger studies to determine if these immune responses to exercise can facilitate viral clearance, ameliorate symptoms of long COVID syndrome, and/or restore functional exercise capacity following SARS-CoV-2 infection.",,,,1631909859,{},hd8zlw2,True,t3_pq7v6x,False,False,t3_pq7v6x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pq7v6x/acute_exercise_increases_immune_responses_to_sars/hd8zlw2/,1632022844.0,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This statement tells you that the value is not reliable. VAERS is a data collection database and is not screened for accuracy (I am pretty sure a bot will chime in with more details because I mentioned VAERS). Due the number of vaccine doses administered, a decent number of deaths are expected to naturally occur within a short period of time of vaccine administration. These deaths are in no way related to the vaccine but are just a statistical coincidence. The majority of the deaths in VAERS are these scenarios. Ignoring the outright false reports by anti-vaxers, doctors are still required to report these deaths so that they can be investigated. This provides an early warning system should something notable appear. So far we haven't seen anything.

Not sure why you think we'd need to do that. All we need to do is classify the positive tests as vaccinated vs unvaccinated. Some states are doing this so it's possible. That should be enough of a subset to extrapolate useful information. From there you just need to compare it to the hospitalization and death rates of vaccinated vs unvaccinated. 

&gt; Where do you get this idea?

It's all relative. Not sure where you got the 3 million hospitalizations, but if we use that, it's a 7.5% chance of hospitalization or in other words a 96.5% chance you won't need to be. That's without adjusting for age, which is heavily skewed against the older at risk population. Is it obviously high and unacceptable to just accept those rates to me? Yes, but the point is simply that the majority of people won't need the hospital and the immunizing efficacy of the vaccine may be the primary reason the vaccinated population is not hospitalized. Therefore we need to maintain high immunizing protection or correct better data. 

I agree vaccines are needed, but as you said this is simply to virulent. If vaccines cannot maintain protection against disease then it will continue to transmit.

Okay so I thought this could be an interesting opportunity to do some education and correct some understandable confusion from someone that may not necessarily have seen this firsthand in the hospital. At this point I‚Äôm pretty convinced you either don‚Äôt carry the requisite critical thinking skills to interpret and analyze these articles through the lens of public health or are just a straight up troll. Either way my patience is gone, and I have better things to do than continue this back and forth.

  
Couple of things: first you just said, ‚Äúbut we are not dealing with different strains, or something that is incredibly different from what first appeared -2 years ago, these variants haven‚Äôt deviated drastically from the original.‚Äù This in and of itself is enough to tell me you have no idea what you are talking about. Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta are all variants of SARS-CoV-2. Here is the CDC stating EXACTLY that: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html). There are more, but those are the four the CDC has currently classified as variants of concern according to their webpage. By now you would have been docked some serious points in a microbiology class. Pencils down. I‚Äôm done doing your homework for you.

  
Secondly, to respond to your comment from ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/posxyn/victorville\_woman\_hospitalized\_battling\_covid/hd6ghs3?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/posxyn/victorville_woman_hospitalized_battling_covid/hd6ghs3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)), you said you were trying to quantify ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù with a reasonable number like 80% yet went after me for vagueness. Then you go on to accuse me of fearmongering this ‚Äúnuanced issue‚Äù because it was disturbing to you. 

  
Let me ask you, how many patients in the ICU have you withdrawn care on? By that I mean you have done everything you can for them week after week knowing the exact trajectory their case is going and how hopeless it is. You have had ALL the phone calls with family members taking more time to calmly explain how dire the situation is than you probably should when you are tripled and have been having to double up rooms due to lack of available bed space in the ICU. You are trying to keep this patient alive just long enough for family to get there and say goodbye so you start them on their fourth pressor and a bicarb drip hoping that it will get them through the hour it takes their loved ones to drive in. How many patients have you done CPR on and ran a code on knowing that if you somehow manage to get them back their chances of survival (especially with anything resembling a normal life) are virtually none. You are there and actually stop the life support measures including turning off the IV pumps running pressors and turn off the ventilator, then watch the monitors for consistent asystole (which doesn‚Äôt always happen fast). How many family members have you had cry on your shoulder? For how many families have you held a phone up in a patient room (fully PPE garbed up btw) to conduct a face time call where you KNOW this is the last time they will hear their loved one‚Äôs voice. For how many families have you conducted a face time call to show them what it‚Äôs like for their loved one to be intubated, have a central line, a foley catheter, a rectal tube, an arterial line, a nasogastric tube with tube feeds, and manual proning while explaining what the values on the ventilator mean and how they just are not responding to treatment after weeks. How many patients have you been at bedside with to assist with tracheostomies and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placements knowing that they will likely have those the rest of their lives while residing at a post-acute care facility? How many patients on the floors with high flow nasal cannulas have you taken care of? Many would probably benefit from intubation, but docs are hesitant because the ICU is already over capacity, and we don‚Äôt have staff trained to manage them. How many patients have you talked to that have managed to live through covid, but will require oxygen or a cardiologist for the rest of their lives due to long term complications of the disease? How many patients have you seen come in with no comorbid conditions only to develop clots and subsequent strokes?

Critical periods are much closer to ""use it or lose it"" in most cases than they are to learned behaviors. 

You're also drawing the wrong idea about humans in hunter-gatherer bands. They don't have any trouble at all with abstract notions; theory of mind, for example, is a complete abstraction that members of bands do effortlessly. Sure, they are bad at absorbing and utilizing cultural ideas that we have grown up with from our mother's teats...and *you* can't do quantum mechanics, and if you try to learn it, you'll suck at it. Everyone does. That doesn't mean you have some inherent difficulty that a particle physicist doesn't. You'll have trouble speaking French, too, if you didn't learn it as a child. That's not a knowledge problem. 

I'm frankly not even sure what to make of your example regarding deaf-mutes. Yes, people thought of it that way-- in part because deaf-muteness commonly occurred alongside other congenital abnormalities, and they didn't realize that early environmental deprivation causes cognitive impairment...but what does that have to do with IQ? 

Your original point about our current interventions raising IQ-- whatever that really measures-- and your point that our current educational systems heavily advantage our children in being successful at the things that educational system is designed to produce-- they're absolutely right! 

But your examples are misguided, in particular the connection of them to each other, and characterizing them as a form of knowledge that somehow inherently differentiates us in some way. 

What your examples demonstrate is that people and kittens have critical periods in which abilities they already have specialized neural circuitry and organs for can fail to develop if unused, and that hunter-gatherers are good at doing what they have been taught and enculterated to do since birth, and bad at things they haven't.",,,,1631892144,{},hd7tlsy,False,t3_ppo9ow,False,False,t1_hd761i4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ppo9ow/the_coronavirus_death_toll_is_approaching_the/hd7tlsy/,1632000909.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That was true 2-3 months ago (in pre-delta world) when vaccinated were unlikely to be spreaders and cases were low.

With advent of delta, things became much more complicated again: cases are up through the roof and delta is contagious enough to spread amount vaccinated (yes, your expected outcome is better but you are still spreading)... Delta also affects children worse than the previous strain (and children &lt;12 cannot be vaccinated)

With hospitals full/filling-up and  no way to limit mask orders to unvaccinated, what do you suggest we (as society) do? Also, importantly, the vaccinated group does get a major benefit from mask mandates: fewer covid cases and better healthcare availability.

This is your original post:

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I think its kind of bullshit that you praise them as heroes one day then refuse to allow them to work cause they suck.

They should have gone with a carrot instead of a stick approach and given a covid bonus to every frontline healthcare worker which is redeemable once they are vaccinated. God knows they deserve it after the past 18 months.

This is basically insulting everyone, even vaccinated health workers, as its calling them expendable again now the hospitals are no longer overflowing.

‚Äê---------------------------‚Äê---------------------------------------

You said yourself that they should have use the carrot not the stick regarding the healthcare worker still not vaccineted. 

This is wrong and I already explained in my comment above why it's wrong so no need to reply further.

You also said that after 18 months healthcare workers deserve some kind of bonuses for their hard work.

That is good and it's basically what everyone in this entire subreddit would suggest to do for them.

My mother got a small bonus as I stated above and I am happy for it since I believe it's the right thing to do at least in my country since I know my country situation better than other countries.

&gt;Since I am saying your mother deserves a bonus of a months wages as long as she is vaccinated and you disagree and call me naive and a fool for believing this am I right in thinking you dont think your own mother deserves some money for the work shes done in the past 2 years?

I was calling you a fool and naive for the carrot and stick thing not for the better paycheck so this thing you wrote here makes no sense at all.

""No,"" says the preacher. ""I have faith in the Lord. He will save me.""

Once again, the preacher insists the Lord will deliver him.

And, predictably, he drowns.

But he lives where Covid is somewhat out of control. They mostly stayed home, did things outdoors.

He went downhill very rapidly. And he died. His wife experienced nothing like what he went through. It was like having a bad head and chest virus or infection for her, minus the pain and headaches those things would normally bring. She felt tired, runny nose, coughing. No sneezing. No headaches. But she did lose her sense of taste and smell. And she is fine. 

They got whatever vaccine was available to them back in early February. J&amp;J. One shot. 

Where we live in a different state, my husband, son and I got Moderna, two shots spread out over 3 weeks and they began giving these to the general public here beginning in March/April.

One might find 19 Jun - 25 Jun a local anomaly, but that was when the vaccine program was modified. After this new rule kicked-in and the ""new transients"" were over, one can see that from 10 Jul - 16 Jul, the vaccination numbers have been increasing. Last week (04 Sep - 10 Sep) it was 53.3 million vaccinations, and 53.8 million vaccinations in the week 28 Aug - 03 Sep. For 11 Sep - 17 Sep, the numbers will be around 64 million vaccinations (if one takes 22.6 million vaccinations for 17 Sep).

It is clear that apart from a local anomaly between 19 Jun - 25 Jun (which might be attributed to the fact that some Indian states were doing things for PR), there hasn't been any such stunts/trends later on. The real issues were intermittency in vaccine supplies (which has been true all over the world), but the vaccine supply in India is pretty steady for now.

So, my request is, let's not politicize this vaccine roll out further. It doesn't help anyone. Let's stop dividing people further. The divide and politicization is already way too much than levels which can be tolerated in a society.

If you are resorting to name calling and ""bolding"" things out, you seem to have a lost cause. As other commentators have also written, there is undeniable evidence of an increasing vaccine numbers weekly beginning July 2021. There is grace in accepting that ""yes, I was wrong"".

I'm no lawyer but I honestly wonder how this would proceed. The hostess sues them in New York state court; the Texans don't show up; N.Y. state court issues a judgment against them; but then what? 

As long as the Texans don't have assets in New York, there's nothing to attach. As long as they never visit New York again, they wouldn't get arrested. Maybe New York would ask Texas to extradite them for trial, but I have a hunch Texas would tell N.Y. ""no dice"".

I really belive that belief is at the root of this. For a lot of people, they basically grew up in a way that they fit their lives into the grooves the law laid out for them, such that they can effectively live their lives as if there is no law that applies to them at all. They have shaped their desires to conform to the law and so breaking it never enters their heads. The law is a thing that is supposed to control those other, bad people and enable good people like them. But then lockdowns and mask mandates came, and suddenly every day the law is keeping them from doing what they want and making them do things they don't want. And that has just fucking broken their brains.

However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

But, there is an externality here we need to consider. People need to have a sense of Hope, Control and a Go Forward Vision for what the future looks like.   


For a lot of people who have been vaccinated for 6,7,8 months, we know as a matter of fact that antibody counts decrease linearly over time. This is observed by a multitude of sources &amp; individuals who perform consistent testing of antibody counts over time.  


It's getting Dark, Sooner. Colder. Masking is become enforced- again. In some cities, vaccination status is becoming mandatory to enjoy public and private life. There is this overwhelming sense of a loss of hope and a lack of where do we go from here. Breakthrough cases are increasing, what used to be ""Only 1% of people in hospital are fully vaxxed"" is now 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%. This happened over a couple of months only. It's scary. Fear is a powerful negative.  


There was this incredible and surreal moment, a massive de-psychosis I believe, in March-April through the early summer for those of us who got vaccinated. Colors were more vivid, people began to plan their travel, weddings and generally, made plans for the future.

Please note that the numbers you cited predict risk in the next 90 days. So if you want your risk for a full year, you have to divide the denominators by about 4. So that puts you at a 1/83,333 chance of death in a year. If my math is right, that would mean quite a few more than 2,000 Americans would have had to die from the vaccine to make the risk of the vaccine higher than the risk of death through infection. My understanding is that even the most sensationalized conservative sources only attribute a handful of deaths to the vaccine, unless they are citing numbers with no verification. 

And to be fair, you should probably be looking at the number of vaccine deaths among people as young and healthy as you are. The numbers I remember heard from various sensationalized news articles is somewhere between 0 and 2. I think checking the data from almost any state‚Äôs health department will reveal that more than 0-2 unvaccinated young people have died from COVID.

Well if states had so many vaccines in the first place,why didn't they opened up more centers and gave an equitable number of doses say 11 mln everyday. Why did they had to keep them ""down"" at 6.6 mln and out of nowhere shoot it up to 2.4mln? 

Because there is also logistics. The number of vaccination centres were also drastically increased.  Don't know if you're indian or not but vaccination slots get booked really fast. You have to take appointment fee days in advance. There are some doses reserved for walk in appointments, but that's a small fraction. 

Anecdotal, but in my neighborhood, I saw three temporary vaccination centres (pandals) being set up yesterday and today which will be dismantled when the vaccine drive in the area is finished. Having a deadline for such centres is very much a thing that happens. 

This did not happen at the cost of reduction of vaccination rates in the country. 

&gt;I don't see you justifying that when it's been done to make headlines on modi's birthday.

I don't see a problem with that if people are getting vaccines anyway. So, the insinuation that vaccination rates were reduced is false.

Also as u/jussayingthings has clarified, such weekly peaks happen all the time in every state when they have a special vaccination drive on a particular day every week.

I don't want and most importantly I cannot state vaccine booster safety (or unsafety) for under 65. I will make a generic comment. 

Vaccines are approved in a context of weighting benefits and risks. Assuming that the risk for the vaccine (booster) dose is similar for all the age ranges, the benefit exponentially increases as the age increases, since COVID is really dangerous to the elders. 

So, hypothetically, it could be that the benefits do not outweigh the risks if you're really young and healthy, but that they vastly do if you are old. 

Thus, the concept of safety is relative.

Then there is the fact that myocarditis cases happen a lot often more in the young cohorts than they do in the older ones, so, quite paradoxically, the risk from the vaccine as small as it is, it's somewhat higher if you're young than if you're old. That weighs in the benefits-risks assessment, in the risks side. 

Myocarditis cases also skyjumped a bit (6-fold) in the second dose compared to the first, and again, this was noticeable especially in young age ranges.

My comment doesn't mean to state that the third dose is safe or unsafe for all. But your comment is quite simplicistic.

The reality most likely is that it would have been nicer to have more data to work on for the decision, possibly provided by Pfizer. 

I hope other vaccines can come as boosters as an alternative, e.g. Novavax, but this is out of the scope of my comment",,,,1631912494,{},hd95ql6,False,t3_pq771w,False,False,t1_hd93a90,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pq771w/fda_panel_rejects_broad_pfizer_booster_plan_mulls/hd95ql6/,,24,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,2c4c2e060719e0d3143e6f101be96b8b93e61943,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1632167320.0,False,r/Coronavirus,public,

I remember having a light ache on my upper left chest and armpit occasionally after Pfizer. Like maybe 4 days post shot and then randomly for a few days. I read some of the symptoms of myocarditis online, and I never had a burning or stabbing pain, swelling, or the feeling of chest pressure. It was just a dull, minor ache that came and went fairly randomly. I guess upper middle-left chest and left armpit (on the side where I received the injection.)

Could be heartburn, could be just general inflammation or swollen lymph nodes, but kind of worried seeing how myocarditis seems to affect way more than they thought. Even though most patients recover quickly, it can lead to a huge increase in mortality in the decade after.

The archive.is site or or one of its sister sites automatically will create an archive. link, which you can copy and paste in your Reddit comment.    
        
For example: If you connect to an article, but you are blocked from reading the article, you still can copy the URL address of the article.     
              
At https://archive\.md/ or a sister archive. site, you can paste the URL address you copied into the ""My url is alive and I want to archive its content"" space bar. Wait a few seconds, and the site automatically will generate an archive. link to the article. The archive. ink will be visible in your URL address bar. You can copy the link and paste it in your Reddit comment.  
         
In addition to you yourself archiving an article at archive\.is or an archive. sister site, in the ""I want to search the archive for saved snapshots"" search bar, I think you can paste the title or URL of an article to search for it in the archive. However, it might be easier and faster if you yourself paste the URL of the article in the ""My url is alive and I want to archive its content"" to create an archive. link to the article. Then, you can use the archive. link to read the article.    
           
According to the Amazon [Alexa\.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa_Internet ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa_Internet"") site, the archive\.is top level domain and its sister top level domains are [ranked 8,816](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/archive.is ""https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/archive.is"") in global internet engagement among the millions (30 million?) of sites that Alexa\.com ranks.",,,,1631911055,{},hd92esx,True,t3_ppqpt1,False,False,t1_hd7uvgi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ppqpt1/at_us_nursing_homes_aides_were_the_least_likely/hd92esx/,,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,89934d8b4188ba93e402ef6a408a57f4e9df2547,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1632167506.0,False,r/Coronavirus,public,1631916305.0

This is tragic and is deadly for persons not fully vaccinated and other persons they infect. The unvaccinated are infecting and killing others, and they are killing themselves.  
           
On July 8, in a White House COVID-19 Response Team press briefing, CDC Director Dr. [Rochelle Walensky said](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/08/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-44/ ""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/08/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-44/"") that ""preliminary data from several states over the last few months suggests that 99.5 percent of deaths from COVID-19 in the United States were in unvaccinated people. Those deaths were preventable with a simple, safe shot."" 
           
In the US, for September 16, the CDC [COVID Data Tracker](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailydeaths ""https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailydeaths"") is reporting a total of 1,823 COVID-19 new daily deaths for that one day.  With 99.5% of COVID-19 deaths in people not fully vaccinated, about 1,815 of those 1,823 new daily deaths were in the unvaccinated.  
           
Furthermore, each person infected with the [Delta B.1.617.2 variant](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions ""https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions""), before they die or before they recover, predictably will infect on average around [3.8 to 8 other persons, with a mean of 5](https://aci.health.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/critical-intelligence-unit/sars-cov-2-variants ""https://aci.health.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/critical-intelligence-unit/sars-cov-2-variants""), who, in turn, can infect 3.8 to 8 other persons each, with the possibility any of the infected might or might not die during the roughly 1 to 4 weeks, or longer, after each is infected.",,,,1631910826,{},hd91vgw,True,t3_ppqpt1,False,True,t1_hd7uvgi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ppqpt1/at_us_nursing_homes_aides_were_the_least_likely/hd91vgw/,,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,2749aa28feb1c2eb5651134fc3bb38480e17a34f,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1632167528.0,False,r/Coronavirus,public,1631913679.0

[],,Molire,,,[],,,,text,t2_174cr0,False,True,,"&gt;Six African lions, a Sumatran tiger and two Amur tigers have tested presumptive positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Last weekend, animal keepers observed decreased appetites, coughing, sneezing and lethargy in several lions and tigers. Fecal samples for all great cats were collected and tested presumptive positive. Final results are expected in the next few days. All lions and tigers are being treated with anti-inflammatories and anti-nausea medication to address discomfort and decreased appetite. In addition, all are being treated with antibiotics for presumptive secondary bacterial pneumonia. They remain under close observation and, because their condition does not require they remain inside, staff will manage the cats‚Äô access to their outdoor habitats. Given the substantial distance between the animals and visitors, the public is not at risk. No other animals at the Zoo are showing any signs of infection.   
            
&gt;The Zoo has conducted a thorough investigation of all staff that were in close proximity to the lions and tigers. There is no evidence to pinpoint the source of the infection. While it is possible the infection was transmitted by an asymptomatic carrier, it has been standard practice for all animal care staff and essential staff to mask indoors in all public and non-public areas. The health and vaccination status of employees is confidential medical information.

Covid Live Updates: F.D.A. Panel Recommends Authorizing Pfizer Booster for People 65 and Older or at High Risk of Severe Covid

The F.D.A. meeting, shown live below, comes as global debate intensifies over whether and for whom additional shots are needed now. The Biden administration is negotiating with Pfizer to buy another 500 million doses of coronavirus vaccine to donate overseas. The U.S. case surge shows signs of slowing, though new Covid deaths remain high.

WASHINGTON ‚Äî A scientific advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration on Friday recommended authorizing a booster shot for recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine who are 65 or older or are at high risk of severe Covid-19.

The move came after the panel overwhelmingly recommended against approving a Pfizer booster for people 16 and older.

The committee voted 16 to 2 against a broader recommendation after an intense daylong public discussion on whether booster shots are necessary and if so, for whom. The Biden administration had been hoping the F.D.A. and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would approve a third shot of the Pfizer vaccine in time to begin rolling out boosters for Pfizer recipients next week.

Although the F.D.A. is not obliged to follow its advisory committee‚Äôs recommendations, it typically does. The agency will likely make a decision by early next week.

The vote came after a sharp debate in which many of the panel‚Äôs independent experts, including infectious disease doctors and statisticians, challenged whether the data justified  extra shots for so much of the population when the vaccines appear to still offer robust protection against severe Covid-19 disease and hospitalization, at least in the United States.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unclear that everyone needs to be boosted, other than a subset of the population that clearly would be at high risk for serious disease,‚Äù said Dr. Michael G. Kurilla, a committee member and official at the National Institutes of Health.

The negative vote was the latest in a series of setbacks for President Biden‚Äôs booster plan since he first announced it a month ago. Mr. Biden said at the time that he wanted most adults who had gotten a second Pfizer or Moderna vaccine at least eight months ago to start receiving booster shots the week of Sept. 20.

But two weeks after his announcement, leaders of the F.D.A. and the C.D.C.  told the White House that it would be impossible to authorize booster shots for recipients of the Moderna vaccine that soon. It is now unclear whether extra injections will be offered to Pfizer recipients, and if so, to how many.

In a remarkable public display of internal dissension, two F.D.A. scientists co-authored a medical journal article earlier this week arguing that there was no credible evidence yet in support of booster shots for the general population. Those officials, who are leaving the agency this fall, joined outside experts and other federal health officials who cast doubt at the meeting on whether Pfizer‚Äôs request should be approved.

On the other hand, Dr. Peter Marks, their superior and the official who oversees the F.D.A.‚Äôs vaccine division, noted that many well-known vaccines require booster shots and urged the committee to consider the importance of not just of preventing severe disease but of curbing the spread of infection.

After the F.D.A. rules on Pfizer‚Äôs request, an advisory committee to the C.D.C. will meet to recommend how exactly the extra doses should be used. Earlier public discussions suggest the C.D.C. committee may be leaning toward tailoring booster shots toward the elderly and others particularly vulnerable to worse outcomes from Covid-19, instead of to all those who received their second injection eight months earlier.

The F.D.A. committee‚Äôs vote followed hours of presentations by officials from Pfizer, the C.D.C., the Israeli government and independent experts on the complex array of data they have collected up until now about the waning effectiveness of Pfizer and other vaccines over time.

Dr. Sara Oliver of the C.D.C. presented data showing that vaccines continue to strongly protect against severe forms of Covid-19 in the United States, even in people 75 and older.

Jonathan Sterne, a professor of medical statistics and epidemiology in the United Kingdom, said he had analyzed 76 different studies on the vaccines‚Äô real world effectiveness and found that multiple factors can skew the results, including how many unvaccinated people in a study have natural immunity from prior Covid-19 disease. He also warned against drawing conclusions from short-term results from booster shots; data from Israel, for example,  only included a follow-up period of several weeks for older adults.

Israeli experts made a different argument, telling the committee that they believed third Pfizer shots helped dampen a fourth wave of transmission as the Delta variant swept the nation this summer. The Israeli government, which has relied almost entirely on the Pfizer vaccine, began offering booster shots in late July, starting with the elderly.

Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, Israel‚Äôs head of public health services said the summer‚Äôs rise in the number of hospitalized patients who had been fully vaccinated with Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine was ‚Äúscary.‚Äù She said 60 percent of severely or critically ill patients and 45 percent of those who died during what she called the fourth surge had received two injections of Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine.

After offering boosters to the general population, she said, Israel is now averaging about half as many severe or critically ill patients as anticipated. She said boosters not only helped curb the spread of infection, but ‚Äúactually saved lives.‚Äù

Another Israeli scientist walked the panel through a new study of health records of more than 1.1. million people over age 60. It found that at least 12 days after the booster, the rates of severe disease were nearly twenty-fold lower among those who received a third Pfizer shot compared to those who did not.

Dr. William C. Gruber, a senior Pfizer vice president in charge of vaccine development, suggested that if the United States does not follow Israel‚Äôs lead, it could potentially face more than five million more infections a year among people who received their second dose 10 months earlier, compared to those who got the second shot five months earlier.

‚ÄúIsrael could portend the U.S. Covid-19 future, and soon,‚Äù he said.

He said Pfizer‚Äôs data shows a third shot elicits a robust antibody immune response that equals or greatly exceeds the response after the second dose. Data also show, he argued, that breakthrough infections among vaccinated Americans are linked more to the ebbing power of the vaccine over time instead than to the Delta variant.

But committee members, including some government officials, appeared deeply skeptical of the Pfizer‚Äôs data and Israel‚Äôs analyses. Dr. Philip Krause, one of the F.D.A. vaccine experts who authored the medical journal review, criticized Pfizer‚Äôs presentation of data that had not been peer-reviewed or evaluated by the F.D.A., arguing that possible problems in the modeling within could understate the vaccine‚Äôs efficacy.

Dr. Oliver, the C.D.C. official, questioned attempts to draw a parallel between the United States and Israel, noting that Israel has only nine million residents and is less diverse than the United States. Notably, she also said that Israel defines a severe case of Covid-19 more broadly than the United States does, which might help explain why Israel reports more serious breakthrough infections among its vaccinated.

Another C.D.C. official, Dr. Amanda Cohn, asked Israeli officials why the spread of the virus there had recently intensified, despite a broad rollout of boosters. Dr. Alroy-Preis said that the Jewish holidays, together with the start of the school year, had contributed to what she suggested would be a temporary surge in cases.

Committee members also said they were concerned about a paucity of safety data in younger recipients of a booster dose, since studies have shown a higher risk of the heart condition myocarditis in young men who received Pfizer-BioNTech‚Äôs vaccine. Several of them asked whether it would be better to wait for a booster vaccine designed specifically to fend off the Delta variant of the virus.",,,,1631911343,{},hd932zr,True,t3_pq8b6w,False,True,t3_pq8b6w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pq8b6w/fda_panel_recommends_authorizing_pfizer_booster/hd932zr/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,714475c861ea57e782f937b515ff9f120b8080d1,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1632167476.0,False,r/Coronavirus,public,

**Waning of immunity in the original clinical trial:** In the original Pfizer clinical trial, 18000 people got placebo and 18000 people got vaccine. 5 months later, the 18000 placebo recipients became eligible to get vaccine. The original placebo group has immunity that is 5 months old, whereas the original vaccine group has immunity that is 10 months old. 

During Delta, scientists could compare infection rate in the original vaccine group and original placebo group. The original vaccine group had 40% more infections than the original placebo group. There were 3 severe infections in the original vaccine group (that is old, waning immunity) versus 0 in the original placebo group (that is new, fresher immunity). This was discussed today by FDA (see [slide 23](https://www.fda.gov/media/152239/download)). It has not been covered by any news outlets that I am aware of. This is the strongest evidence out there in my mind because participants were randomized (albeit open label during the Delta post hoc analysis), versus the observational studies that make headlines today. Observational studies have problems because the people who get vaccines may also avoid bars or seek healthcare for their colds, etc, complicating the picture.

**Antibodies vs. T cell responses:** Mechanistically, antibodies recognize specific targets (epitopes) of spike protein, respond rapidly to infection, and could be subverted by new variants. T cells respond more slowly but recognize several components of spike protein. They are likely to prevent severe disease, which (arguably?) is the main goal of the vaccine. Antibodies are widely discussed in headlines mainly because they are easy and unambiguous to measure, but the emergence of immunity from vaccines arises before high levels of antibodies are detected, signifying that the T cell response is also important.

**More information:** Eric Rubin is a voting member of VRBPAC (the FDA group meeting that met today) and discussed the science behind boosters in this week's New England Journal of Medicine podcast. TWiV is a podcast that discusses immunology at depth and has done so for much of the past year.",,,,1631911284,{},hd92y2p,False,t3_pq771w,False,False,t1_hd8wy5t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pq771w/fda_panel_rejects_broad_pfizer_booster_plan_mulls/hd92y2p/,,83,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,0753756b62a36d39690f4b77215630757ae1fccf,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1632167482.0,False,r/Coronavirus,public,

Comment from /u/lovememychem :
The VRBPAC has passed the second voting question, recommending Emergency Use Authorization of a third vaccine dose of COMIRNATY (Pfizer/BioNTech) given at least 6 months after completion of the primary series for use in:

individuals 65 years of age and older, and
individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19.
Advisory straw poll unanimously recommends that HCWs or occupational exposure should be included in that statement in the final recommendation.

[],,NathanNance,,,[],,,,text,t2_8jnuxwf,False,False,,"&gt; Please note that the numbers you cited predict risk in the next 90 days. So if you want your risk for a full year, you have to divide the denominators by about 4.

I'm not sure that's a valid inference. Surely to divide by 4 you'd be making the assumption that it's possible to catch covid and then re-catch it three additional times, with the same risk of death each time? Everything we know about natural immunity suggests that is not the case, and that once you've caught and recovered from it once the risk of a breakthrough infection (let alone a breakthrough hospitalisation/death) is incredibly low.

&gt;And to be fair, you should probably be looking at the number of vaccine deaths among people as young and healthy as you are.

I'd love to, a similar tool to QCovid except for vaccine side-effects would be perfect. I'm not sure if being young and healthy reduces risk of side-effects (it would seem logical), but for myocarditis in particular I've seen that it's [*more* likely](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html) to affect young males (most at-risk group is slightly younger than me, but not by a massive amount). I've also seen that [side-effects are more common in people with a previous infection](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/why-vaccine-side-effects-might-be-more-common-people-whove-already-had-covid-19). Could that inflate risk of death too? I don't know.

Yes, it clearly happens, I'm not debating that fact. But it usually clears up on its own or with minimal treatment, right? Whereas COVID has the potential for a lot more problems for people.

Look, I don't have a science background and the people on this panel are way smarter than me.

That's separate from vaccinating kids, and soon as that is approved we can get them their shots and reduce their risks and their potential to spread the virus.

So essentially right now we have a collision of the ideal (getting everyone vaccinated) with reality (not everyone is vaccinated, there's some waning in immunity over time and the early vaccinated are already ~8 months out) combined with heading into the fall where school has started and people will be spending more time indoors, at least in the northern climates, plus more family get together holidays on the way.
