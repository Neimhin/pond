You already might be familiar with the following information, but, if not, you might find it useful:       
          
The [White House YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteHouse/videos ""https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteHouse/videos"") has official White House videos, including the _White House COVID-‚Å†19 Response Team and Public Health Officials_ press briefings.  
          
The most recent _White House COVID-
19 Response Team and Public Health Officials_ press briefing was on September 2. The transcript can be [read here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/09/02/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-54/ ""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/09/02/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-54/""), and the press briefing slides (pdf file)  can be [viewed here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/COVID-Press-Briefing_2September2021-_transcript.pdf ""https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/COVID-Press-Briefing_2September2021-_transcript.pdf"").  
                   
Recently, over the past 30 days, the _White House COVID-‚Å†19 Response Team and Public Health Officials_ have held a live televised press briefing via teleconference on 7 different dates, an average of 1 press briefing about every 4-5 calendar days.  
              
Each briefing usually lasts for about 20-30 minutes,  more or less, and takes place on a weekday. I do not recall the exact time of day for each briefing, but I think they usually are held sometime between 12PM  to 6PM EDT.    
           
U.S. national cable television networks (e.g., CNN, MSNBC) usually cover and broadcast each live press briefing.  
                  
The U.S. government officials speaking during each  press briefing include Jeffrey Zients, who is the Coordinator of the COVID-19 Response Team, and he is Assistant to the President and Counselor to the President.  
              
The two other speakers in each press briefing are CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky and the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH), Dr. Anthony Fauci.   
          
During each press briefing, after Zients, Walensky, and Fauci have presented the latest information and slides about COVID-19 and vaccines to the public, some viewers phone into the briefing and ask questions. Walensky and Fauci answer the questions. 
              
At the White House Briefing Room [web site](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/ ""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/""), links are available for reading the transcript of each press briefing. Near the bottom of the page for each press briefing, a link goes to a pdf file that includes the slides presented during each  press briefing.",,,,1630807604,{},hbn2ilf,True,t3_phf4t7,False,True,t1_hbkfrzh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/phf4t7/press_briefing_by_white_house_covid19_response/hbn2ilf/,1630893212.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The superintendent says all a teacher can do is ask the student if they know there's a mask mandate and offer them a mask. If they refuse the mask, that's about all you can do. Seems a lot like where we were before, with masks being optional. Keep in mind, the school board hires/fires the superintendent so if he wants to keep his job he basically has to play along with the insanity. Also get this, if teachers or staff are seen without masks they face ""disciplinary action."" I don't find that unreasonable, just funny how no one in charge actually cares about the kids spreading this disease.

They can mitigate the symptoms of some others. But some chronic illnesses cause your body to attack itself, like myasthenia gravis, where your antibodies attack your muscles when you exercise, destroying their nerve receptors. Some attack the autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for unconscious muscle use like your lungs, your heart, and your digestive system. It doesn‚Äôt matter how well you eat if your intestines will no longer digest your food. There are many more like those, than there are ‚Äúself-inflicted‚Äù diseases. 

It is absolutely true that some chronic conditions can be prevented or cured if you ‚Äúeat healthy and exercise more.‚Äù But it‚Äôs a vast oversimplification of the issue, and encourages ableism by implying that people with chronic illness have brought it upon themselves by being careless, and that they deserve their suffering. And if they did it to themselves and deserve their suffering, then why develop infrastructure to help them? 

The fact is that good health is as much a product of luck as it is a product of virtue. Some people are healthy throughout their lives. Others inherited an unfortunate gene that was activated by chance, or caught a common virus that triggered an outsized immune response. Those people deserve dignity, respect, and compassion as much as anyone else.

Question about the Pfizer vaccine and myocarditis. I‚Äôm 27 and I got my first shot of Pfizer back in early May. I had a high heart rate for a week after the shot and ended up going to urgent care for it. I had chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and a high heart rate. Doctor did blood work and looked me over and said it‚Äôs likely just anxiety. I started to feel fine about another week after this. 

Anyway, this deterred me from get the second shot because I was worried. I still don‚Äôt know if it wasn‚Äôt myocarditis or not. 

My question is: If it was myocarditis, and I‚Äôve recovered now, how likely would it be for me to get it again with the second shot?

The information at times is so riddled with esoteric jargon and statistics that it would be fool-hardy to expect an average person to fully ""get"" what is being said.  

Some would argue the strategy of ""dumbing it down,"" but I had it drilled into my head during undergrad that it was more the ability to write/speak for the audience you have in mind.  Funny enough, this was taught to me by a co-editor for a journal, who I was lucky enough to have for my scientific writing course.   

 That has stuck with me over the years.  Looking back, the best teachers, professors, and speakers I've seen are those that can bridge that gap between the higher level academia and someone not in the field.  Please keep in mind that it really still is a two way street and we should encourage people to be able to consume more complex material as well.

The funny thing is that before we even get to the points above, the concept of science being constantly in motion could be stressed as early as grade school.  Ideally, it should be, but I don't think our education system has been as robust in driving that point home.  That's really just a matter of a dearth of teaching critical thinking and continued emphasis on rote memorization.",,,,1630851524,{},hboti4j,False,t3_phudlg,False,True,t1_hbonovc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/phudlg/us_coronavirus_already_vaccinated_against_covid19/hboti4j/,1630924746.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yeah, 1-5% of cases is **HUGE**.

&gt; No surprise that if you're hospitalized and have lung scarring, you'd have long-term issues. Full vaccination takes that risk essentially to zero

Not essentially zero, especially with waning vaccine efficacy.

&gt; Then if we're talking about long-term debilitating symptoms from mild or asymptomatic infections, it's likely 1% or less.

Exactly -- this is a HUGE number if it is 1%, or even half of that.

&gt; This is not a reason to unnecessarily implement booster doses in rich countries. The proper response to this problem is to help poor countries set up the infrastructure.

It most certainly is, if we gave out 1st and 2nd doses in the US to prevent the deaths from COVID, which also hovered something around &lt;1% of cases before the vax.

As for infrastructure, that's the ""we can do both"" part -- give out boosters domestically, and provide aid to build infrastructure or whatever.

&gt; A booster regimen will probably eat up 150+ million doses.

Its' going to be far more than that, if you want to boost your entire population, or boost the subset that is willing to get boosters regularly. That's what it could take to keep the personal and economic fallout from long covid at bay, which, if you already accept that preventing death and hospitalization is important, you would logically extend to this other severe outcome that seems to be ballpark just as common as death before vaxx.",,,,1630860768,{},hbpe9r1,False,t3_pi4mt9,False,True,t1_hbp6ct3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pi4mt9/virus_czar_calls_to_begin_readying_for_eventual/hbpe9r1/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,1272cc449c96b0462354a36e4f133b9065cdca24,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1630860784.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Variants are discovered all the time. Most of the info about variants and vaccine escape/antibody evasion come from computer modeling. Very little is actually done in BSL3 testing against the actual virus/variant. For vaccines to become 'obsolete' would mean the virus would basically have to become a new virus/strain. SAR-COV-2 infects with it's SPIKE protein that attaches to ACE2 on our cell membranes. Gains entry, and replicates. Vaccines were designed to target SPIKE. So for the vaccines to become completely in-effective, that would mean that SPIKE has become so altered, the virus would no longer be able to attach to ACE2 - hence not being able to infect. Now, are there potentially other proteins that might assist in binding, perhaps. But the odds of vaccines becoming completely useless or obsolete are extremely unlikely at least with COV-2. Does immunity wain from vaccines? It appears so, but we forget to discuss memory B cells and T cells retaining protection and creating new antibodies when threatened. With regards to 'Delta', it's all about fitness. Delta is just far too dominant globally to be outcompeted. Viruses generally become more adaptive to humans over time and become less of a threat as our immune systems become less naive via natural infection or vaccines.

In addition to what everyone else has said, lets not forget the onset of the delta variant.

While the original strain of COVID has an R0 (average # of people infected/case) of 2.4-ish, the Delta variant is somewhere between 6 and 7.

So vaccination rates that annihilated the original strain of COVID aren't enough to stop the Delta variant. As a result, we saw COVID cases plummet almost to extinction as the original strain was wiped out, but now that the original strain is gone cases have begun growing again as the Delta variant grows even with our current vaccination rates.

Then perhaps you shouldn't have used HIV as your comparison for making an argument. The persistence through reservoirs is absolutely the only reason we haven't eliminated HIV. The drug cocktail reduces viral replication to undetectable levels. If not for the reservoirs, the antiviral cocktail would be a cure. 

It is true that covid could mutate quickly to gain immunity or partial immunity to an antiviral such as the protease inhibitor Pfizer is currently testing. I don't want to negate that point.

necessarily the artist who made it. My all time favorite quote on this matter is from Nick Cave (cut and paste from [this article](https://www.nme.com/news/music/nick-cave-doesnt-think-we-can-separate-the-art-from-the-artist-nor-should-we-need-to-2944075)):

*I don‚Äôt think we can separate the art from the artist, nor should we need to. I think we can look at a piece of art as the transformed or redeemed aspect of an artist, and marvel at the miraculous journey that the work of art has taken to arrive at the better part of the artist‚Äôs nature.  Perhaps beauty can be measured by the distance it has travelled to come into being.*

*""That bad people make good art is a cause for hope,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTo be human is to transgress, of that we can be sure, yet we all have the opportunity for redemption, to rise above the more lamentable parts of our nature, to do good in spite of ourselves, to make beauty from the unbeautiful, and to have the courage to present our better selves to the world.‚Äù*

*Cave then elaborated further on the topic of hope, saying that it can ‚Äúreside in¬†a gesture of kindness¬†from one broken individual to another¬†or,¬†indeed, we can find it in a work of art that comes from the hand of a wrongdoer.""*",,,,1630793731,{},hbmbeeh,False,t3_phspmt,False,False,t1_hblzftx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/phspmt/neil_young_on_concerts_in_the_covid_age_these_are/hbmbeeh/,1630879057.0,54,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Let me put this into perspective for you.  If one person is murdered, it's a big deal.  HUGE!   many people will spend months investigation the death of ONE human.  They will arrest a person, they will have a trial that takes months,  involving dozens and dozens of people.  When convicted the person will be placed in an expensive prison for decades. 

That is ONE DEATH. 

No police officer says ""well,  compared to the number of people who weren't murdered,  it's pretty small, so it's ok"".

Now,  how big of a deal is 650,000 americans who died in about one year,  who would not have died if not for COVID, who would be alive right now with their family and friends?

Ok,  now divide 650,000 families that lost a loved one, by any huge number.   Oh,  that's ok now.   Do those 650,000  families just laugh it off,  do they feel great?

Regardless, there are people trying to run the numbers (which is a long analysis but I can try reiterating here) and arriving at the conclusion of a ~1 in 200 chance of permanent-ish, debilitating damage from an infection, even after the vaccine IIRC. This is intuitively plausible from your 5% long-covid breakthrough rate, that 1 in 10 of those people would have severe-long-covid breakthroughs. My point is not to nail down an exact number, which is impossible right now, but to show that it's not likely a 1 in 10000 or even 1 in 1000 risk per infection, which are arguably much more ""negligible.""

Several current and past vaccines have been 3-shot format.  1st to 2nd one month and then 6 months for #3.  Biden suggested 8 months because FDA hasn't approved anything yet and 8 months is about as fast as they may be able to handle the approval.

He assumed Moderna would be included alongside Pfizer, but FDA threw a hissy fit.  A couple top people even resigned.  So they backed Moderna out of the plan until it can be separately reviewed and approved.  Maybe an extra 2-3 months.  No plans at all for J&amp;J booster because it was so late getting started and have had so few takers that there is hardly any data for FDA to use for approval.  But everyone knows they need something.  TBD.

So Israel was first to get well vaccinated and everyone is looking to their data (which is Pfizer).  At-risk people seem to need it in the 5-6 month timeframe, so that's where the 5 month thing came from.  But only 8 month is currently doable for scheduling purposes, so that's still our plan.

So chances are Pfizer people MAY be offered an 8 month shot starting Sept 20, IF FDA gets it approved in time.  Moderna will be some weeks or months after that.  And for J&amp;J they'll have to come up with a from-scratch plan -- who knows what or when that will be?  Meanwhile over 1 million people, maybe 2 million by now, have taken matters into their own hands and gotten unapproved 3rd shots.  They phony the request saying this is their first shot.  A shame it's had to come to that, but our public health system just really isn't pandemic-efficient.

They were trying to figure out what covid was impacting internally, because it seemed to be impacting various organs but also causing a different sort of small series of blood clots. I was keeping an eye on various information coming out and I heard the idea that covid impacts your endothelial tissues. I said to myself...""wtf are endothelial tissues?"" and was horrified as I read. These are a small layer of cells,  ""Endothelial cells form a single cell layer that lines all blood vessels and regulates exchanges between the bloodstream and the surrounding tissues.""

Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26848/


They are pretty damn important. How does covid get in and cause damage?


""Preliminary studies indicate that vascular endothelial cells can be infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and evidence of widespread endothelial injury and inflammation is found in advanced cases of COVID-19. Prior evidence has established the crucial role of endothelial cells in maintaining and regulating vascular homeostasis and blood coagulation. Aggravation of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 may therefore impair organ perfusion and cause a procoagulatory state resulting in both macro- and microvascular thrombotic events.""

Apparently our kidneys have various types of endothelial tissues. This is why I do not want covid. There seems to be vascular damage all over (brain, lungs, kidneys, etc), and it seems to be at least somewhat of a crapshoot about who it impacts, where in their body and how severely. Yes we have noticed some trends like people with diabetes might be more susceptible but we also hear about people who are relatively healthy getting weird long covid symptoms. As someone who has survived a huge blood clot *they aren't fun or funny*, they can kill you in a very short time. I don't even want to play this messed up roulette game.


 That's why I'm genuinely astounded when healthy people I know are like, ""It doesn't bother me if I get covid"". Not enough time has passed for us to see the full impact of this. I agree with some of the other posters that there will be people with chronic illnesses. There might be a whole generation of children who have issues related to covid.

However, the real way that vaccines eliminate viruses is by shutting down their spread. You don't hear about how measles or polio vaccines saved someone from being hospitalized, you hear about how almost no one gets measles or polio anymore. This is the real reason to investigate boosters. Since COVID spreads so much before symptoms, I would imagine that the B and T cells protecting someone from hospitalization and death probably has little impact on preventing them from spreading the disease early on.

I'm not a medical expert, but I do have a degree in math and feel that people have been overemphasizing the personal protection that vaccines give and underemphasizing the chain reaction effect of wiping out entire transmission chains.

in the case of disabled folks with fatigue and mobility issues, like with long covid and CFS/ME, telling someone to ""just eat right and exercise"" is an extra-special ""f*** you"" because activities like light exercise and cooking healthy meals are so exhausting that the trigger severe fatigue that leaves you bedridden and escalate symptom severity into a downward spiral of worsening conditions. and ""eating right"" is even more out of reach for disabled folks because you cannot cook healthy meals yourself, and you can't afford healthy, ready-made meals now that your disability has damned you to eternal poverty.

&gt; It‚Äôs the same way that sitting too much can kill you

and people with mobility disabilities (including long-covid ad CFS/ME) get told this shit all the time too. my own doctor tried to prevent me from getting a wheelchair because ""sitting too long can be detrimental"" even as i was telling him that i was bed-bound and unable to get to the toilet with the aid of a cane or walker.

It become a less simple message once a few things became true w/ the delta variant:  vaccinated people also are contributing to spread, although less frequently.  Possibly hitting young people harder, Hospitals being overrun in many areas due to primarily unvaccinated people.  Messaging on breakthrough cases/effectiveness being all over the place (the media REALLY sucks at relaying scientific information from studies in a responsible way).  

In this environment the last thing you want to do is require hospitalization of some kind, and if you care about what's going on in hospitals right now you wouldn't want to contribute to the exponential spread that has been happening.

If I may quickly share a deeply personal story - My Mother was a nurse, SICU. She was also a devout believer *not going to say which ""Religion""* and was told repeatedly by people who she trusted that *Faith Healing* ( many have this idea) was possible and achievable. She continued to care for her patients with compassion and medical competence and, as far as I know, never shared her beliefs with them. When she became ill with metastatic breast cancer she made the choice to hide it, effectively refusing treatment. And double down on faith. She constantly watched a certain *Television Broadcast Station* who reaffirmed *Faith Healing* continually. She died, quickly to us who were finally made aware of the situation but who knows how long she hid it and suffered. And I was effectively "" orphaned"" at 15. This was well before social media and my Mother had never touched ""the internet"" except in whatever capacity it existed at her work.

I've tried to be as nonspecific as possible in hopes I don't get taken down but if you know, then you know.
I CAN'T POSSIBLY be the only child who experienced something like this in their parents or other loved ones. 

When we laugh at ""fools"" today doing essentially the same thing I think of my Mother. Beautiful, compassionate, brave and intelligent. My heart breaks a little at each dismissive comment. 

I grew up with the internet. To me it was ""more fun"" than TV. And there were certain lines drawn in the sand as to what as ""fun"" and what was ""educational""...just like Television. Also...I remember going to the grocery store, standing in line and seeing on every magazine cover the photos of that terrible heart breaking day in November 18th 1978. If you know, you know. 

I absolutely understand how the internet has changed the world, information, education...*ect*
I get the impact. But we are talking about something that has existed long before reddit and mods. What people are doing during this pandemic somewhat amounts to *faith* healing...on a much more social and massively impactful way. 

If my Mother was alive today I have no doubt she would have refused the vaccine...but I didn't. 

I have come to understand that much of medical distrust AND faith can dove tail in that WE ALL FEAR DEATH. We all want some semblance of control over our own mortality. We ALWAYS have built beliefs to deal with that. I say medical mistrust and NOT medical science because some believe that medical science can push back death indefinitely. Medical Science never made that claim. And what they tell us is frightening and we want to rail against it. And we do, without any kind of medical understanding at all. We ""disprove"" them because it sooths our fears... including the fear that they are fallible. Which, of course, they are.

We are not going to censor this out. But eventually we will all *laugh* at the *fools* who *drank the flavor aid*. As if that makes the innocent any less dead... But we will move on. If we, personally, survive. 

Medical science is working to understand the phycology of cults. And programers are working on making vetted information more obvious and accessable. And nurses and doctors are working to calm and sooth our fallible bodies. What we need to do, if we are not one of those, is address why we as individuals fear and resist death with *faith*. And stand with those who do not force others to suffer for thier beliefs ( THAT is a lot of embarrassing history to process and recover from). And maybe someday there will be no more terrible TV programs, no more misinformation social media links, no more... marginalized isolated vulnerable people...who ""choose to die"" and give real dollars to buy up ""safe"" ""utopian"" blocks of land in South America...*ect*. And instead of laughing we can breathe a sigh of relief. And finally truly mourn our lost loved ones.

That's why we have effectively eradicated it with vaccines by giving everyone immunity.  It never created global pandemics and outbreaks were fairly local.  Once we had an outbreak, communities could usually get control of them.  

Smallpox has failed the evolutionary game.  Covid and other respiratory viruses have been around far longer and continue to propagate because over time they lose their severity and and become very contagious.  Also, they evolve just enough to evade neutralizing immunity so that they can infect people many times over their lives without killing them.  Smallpox failed at all these things.

The source for this story is a doctor that has not worked in that facility for months. The hospital stated that they have not seen ivermectin overdoses and that they are not having any problems treating ER patients. At best, there‚Äôs conflicting information from reputable sources. At worst, this doctor lied in order to generate media hysteria. Without confirmation from the hospital, it seems pretty irresponsible to allow a post like that with 35k upvotes to remain visible without a disclaimer. Do you realize that when stories like this are debunked, it actually contributes legitimacy to vaccine hesitancy/skepticism? Why is there such an emphasis on curbing one form of misinformation, but not the other?

Last week Israel has a ton of deaths, either a record amount or close to that I believe.

From what I downloaded from their datasets, it seems like about 60-65% of the dead were vaccinated with either a 2nd or 3rd dose.

Likewise the numbers match with severe illness and catching the virus - the percentage of vaccinated people getting covid/getting severe illness/dying from covid doesn't seem too far from their percentage in society.

This was obviously not the case a few months ago, so the only conclusions is that the Pfizer vaccine barely has any effectiveness after roughly 5-6 months.

As you know Israel is already vaccinating people for the 3rd time. My question is what happens now? What happens in 4 months? Are we just getting a 4th and 5th and 6th dose? Wouldnt that just create a situation where the west continuiously hogs these vaccines and takes another one every 4 months leaving the poorer countries with no vaccines? Is Pfizer going to address the fact that their vaccine appears to last not long enough? Will we see protections against new variants in these new doses? Is there a chance the 3rd dose will offer more long lasting immunity?

There are many treatments, some backed by research and others not-so-much, that a doctor could administer early if they were worried, or if they wanted to ensure that likelihood of severe disease is minimized. Politicians, celebrities, and the wealthy are good examples of this situation. You can google the indicated mabs, dexamethasone, remdesivir, etc. 

All of these meds are big guns that carry serious risks. Doctors are given guidelines - not objective rules to follow. Ultimately they are allowed to supersede standard protocol if they deem necessary. So yes, some doctors do preemptively and unnecessarily prescribe these treatments and more.

TLDR: Death rate is a useful metric to follow because it helps guide treatment. Total number of deaths is important to track, but that figure is much less useful in most contexts.

It is not objectively false. Three fourths of people who were part of the Provincetown cluster *in early July* were vaccinated. This is what led to the CDC's about face with masking for the vaccinated. 

""Hope"" was Walensky's word in her interview with Wolf Blitzer. She said we have hope, we don't yet have strong data. Data for boosters in Israel is only 12 days old.  Yes, antibodies go up with the booster. How long will that last? We don't know. This is why the FDA asked for a slow down on pushing for boosters and only Pfizer boosters are going to go forward in the immediate future for a select group of people. 

&gt; It‚Äôs also not out of the question that this will be the last booster for quite some time.

Which concluded: 

&gt;As for the vast majority of human viruses, the most parsimonious explanation for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic event. The documented epidemiological history of the virus is comparable to previous animal market-associated outbreaks of coronaviruses with a simple route for human exposure. The contact tracing of SARS-CoV-2 to markets in Wuhan exhibits striking similarities to the early spread of SARS-CoV to markets in Guangdong, where humans infected early in the epidemic lived near or worked in animal markets. Zoonotic spillover by definition selects for viruses able to infect humans. Although strong safeguards should be consistently employed to minimize the likelihood of laboratory accidents in virological research, those laboratory escapes documented to date have almost exclusively involved viruses brought into laboratories specifically because of their known human infectivity.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
There is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has a laboratory origin. There is no evidence that any early cases had any connection to the WIV, in contrast to the clear epidemiological links to animal markets in Wuhan, nor evidence that the WIV possessed or worked on a progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 prior to the pandemic. The suspicion that SARS-CoV-2 might have a laboratory origin stems from the coincidence that it was first detected in a city that houses a major virological laboratory that studies coronaviruses. Wuhan is the largest city in central China with multiple animal markets and is a major hub for travel and commerce, well connected to other areas both within China and internationally. The link to Wuhan therefore more likely reflects the fact that pathogens often require heavily populated areas to become established (Pekar et al., 2021).  
&gt;  
&gt;  
We contend that although the animal reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified and the key species may not have been tested, in contrast to other scenarios there is substantial body of scientific evidence supporting a zoonotic origin. While the possibility of a laboratory accident cannot be entirely dismissed, and may be near impossible to falsify, this conduit for emergence is highly unlikely relative to the numerous and repeated human-animal contacts that occur routinely in the wildlife trade. Failure to comprehensively investigate the zoonotic origin through collaborative and carefully coordinated studies would leave the world vulnerable to future pandemics arising from the same human activities that have repeatedly put us on a collision course with novel viruses.",,,,1630874270,{},hbq8lf1,False,t3_pi483f,False,True,t1_hbomguz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pi483f/why_many_scientists_say_its_unlikely_that/hbq8lf1/,1630952787.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Setting gender aside, the risk of long term post-COVID-19 infection complications is far greater than any vaccination risk. While there are a few loud dissonant voices passing on COVID-19 misinformation, I don't know of any reputable pediatric or family medicine providers who  recommend passing on a COVID-19 vaccination for most adolescents 12 and older. 

There is an [AAP article](https://www.aappublications.org/news/2021/06/23/acip-covid-vaccination-myocarditis-062321) from late June that does highlight the number for boys 12-17 from VAERS reporting. In the United States, there were 67 reported events per 1 million vaccinations. Since many of reported events in VAERS are not able to be confirmed, that most likely puts the number around 30-50 worst case. That indicates there is a still a far higher risk of COVID-19 related illness as compared to vaccination induced illness.

The updated strategy is likely to be published on Monday, Sanna Marin said in the Prime Minister's Question Time on Yle Radio Suomi on Sunday.

The government will meet on Sunday evening to discuss, among other things, the amendment to the Infectious Diseases Act that will abolish section 58d, the so-called two-metre rule.

The next meeting of the whole government will take place the very next day, when it is expected to finish its update of the hybrid strategy.

- Our aim is to publish the updated hybrid strategy on Monday,"" said Prime Minister Sanna Marin (SDP) during the Prime Minister's Question Time on Yle Radio Suomi on Sunday.

According to the updated strategy, Finland will abolish the coronary restrictions when more than 80% of Finns over the age of 12 have received two doses of the vaccine. According to the current timetable, this could happen in October. This also applies to the recommendation on mouthguards.

- Mouthguards are a restriction like the others. Our aim is to remove the restrictions when vaccination coverage is sufficiently high. The restrictions can be phased out even before that, but finally when we reach that level of vaccination,"" Marin said.
Vaccination certificate in October

The draft law on a national corona certificate is also currently being finalised by the Ministry of Employment and the Economy. Marin said the government's goal is to submit the bill to Parliament in mid-September, along with several other amendments to the Infectious Diseases Act.

- The goal is to have the corona certificate in use by mid-October.

According to Marin, the corona certificate is to be a voluntary alternative to the current restrictions.

Similar certificates have long been used in many other countries to enable, for example, the cultural and events industry to organise events in corona periods. Mr Marin rejected claims that the government had been late in introducing the certificate in Finland. She said the issue was already being investigated in the spring.

- But I would not have used the certificate already in the summer when vaccination coverage was not yet at the same level as now, Marin said.
Difficult budget negotiations ahead?

The government's budget negotiations start on Tuesday, and before the actual negotiations, the government quintet has met repeatedly to negotiate next year's budget.

This spring's negotiations on the budget framework were very difficult, and even threatened to bring down the government. Originally, the government was supposed to negotiate for two days, but it finally took nine days before the Prime Minister could announce that the five government parties had agreed on the framework for next year's budget.

- We are now aiming to complete the negotiations in two days. The government quintet will still meet after the full government meeting on Sunday evening to discuss the outstanding issues, Marin said.

According to Marin, there are open questions regarding the climate, taxes and employment.

Recently, there has been a heated debate between the Greens and the Centre Party over planned cuts in research funding. The parties also disagree on whether the negotiations should primarily focus on climate, as the Greens believe, or employment, as the Centre Party advocates.

During the Prime Minister's Question Time, Marin was asked whether it is a climate negotiation or an employment negotiation that is coming up.

- I replied that it was a budget negotiation. As part of the negotiations, we are dealing with climate measures, employment measures and, of course, issues relating to taxation,"" Marin said.

- I personally believe that we should stick to what we agreed in the negotiations last spring.

The government decided in the spring negotiations that it would come up with employment measures that would strengthen public finances by EUR 110 million during the parliamentary term.

- We do not have to take all the decisions in these negotiations, but of course we will strive to take decisions as soon as possible. I am a realist and I believe that the negotiations will at least result in some decisions,"" Marin said.

[],,SelfishlyIntrigued,,,[],,,,text,t2_7rpx4zyq,False,False,,"In a weird way we unfortunately did this pandemic backwards.

Unfortunately hindsight is 20/20 and COVID19 is a perfect example of it.

COVID19 the original strain did not spread outdoors very well, social distancing and large public events being canceled would be all that would be required and transmission from outdoors would still be very very low. Even close by, COVID19 outdoors did not spread that well.

But due to us not knowing that, we threw the kitchen sink at it and went full masking everywhere. It was actually ridiculous, and it causes fatigue and as science catches up and proves outdoor transmission is basically non existent(with social distancing, we aren't talking large groups close together for long periods of time) it causes more and more distrust and hate for masks.

So masks get used as an incentive to eventually get vaccinated, and we get the Alpha Variant or UK Variant before vaccines. This was also around the time a lot of places were easing restrictions. Then delta, when the world decided no more masks outdoors after vaccine, no more X and Y, and just dropping all mandates all together. 

Delta does actually require masking outdoors. See what we mean by ""We did it backwards""?

Due to the viral load required to catch a virus a single viral particle can't infect you, delta requires much much less viral load then original covid, so it causes much much more spread indoors and outdoors.

Truthfully what should have been done was masking indoors and canceling of large events and social distancing outdoors. When Alpha became a thing outdoor masking and canceling of small events should have occured, and when delta became a thing masking outdoors should have occured.

Yes lockdowns should have happened based upon hospitalization rates and case rates as well.

But Delta changed things, the reason we are seeing this mass spread is because for the most part original covid never really got rural areas. In needed population density, so cities got hit bad and early, especially if they had mass transit systems like subways, and depending on events a state or area is known for also changes the statistically likelyhood of a strain spreading. 

Places like Florida are hot beds for people going there, being outdoors, and leaving. Rural areas never really seen large spread, because small groups, and original covid barely spread outdoors, and if the events in your area are largely outdoors then it happens even less. 

Delta changed that, but moreso think from a psychological standpoint, in a sense rural people have been forced to do things that were not actually making that much difference at all because how they lived rural areas would be less likely to spread original covid in the first place, yes masking should be indoors, no large events, social distance outside.

They never seen covid bad, so and due to misinformation and rural voters tending to be more conservative and more conservative more unlikely to get vaccinated and they never seen covid bad so they don't care either it all kinda reinforces it from 50 different angles they are not going to change now. They stopped caring long ago.

Then delta changed things.

A grouping of 10 people who semi don't care about covid but kinda do so at least stay distanced or instead of being in a shed they are having a fire outside drinking might never spread original covid at all, or a small party may spread a single case. 

They aren't ""semi caring"" around a fire anyone, they are back in the shed chainsmoking with 20 people who aren't vaccinated or maybe 3-4 of them are. 

That would have been a recipe for disaster for original covid, for delta... it's a catastrophe. So we effectively did the pandemic is reverse in a way, people are burnt out, we need the semi-care but won't admit it people to at least go back to their behavior but it won't happen by the time delta already burned through all their friends.

Truly the pandemic has been the Urban wave with original covid vs the rural wave with delta. Yes both waves hit both, but severely one-sided. With apathy and burnout in rural, and in urban people remembering the horror just makes delta fought harder in urban areas, and barely at all in rural areas. 

Maybe that still doesn't answer the question, but Hawaii was largely locked down, after vaccinations got to a certain point vacations occur in mass again, delta wave is occuring, people from all states and walks of life are flying for vacation, delta changes things with spread, most people who spread may leave before they count, but their infection rate rips through the rural and urban areas in hawaii that were largely protected due to all the factors mentioned above, and basically no vacations or travel occurring, and being an isolated island nation and the type of events that happen and delta vs og covid.",,,,1630863277,{},hbpjxpt,False,t3_pi5j7h,False,True,t1_hbpclgl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pi5j7h/hawaii_hospitals_run_out_of_icu_beds_scramble_to/hbpjxpt/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,96f5af991c3bc054c330b19ec55e5dc6b57455de,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1630863294.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

You got vaccinated to protect yourself but much more importantly to stop a virus from wrecking havoc on everyone else. The vaccine will, statistically speaking, keep you from getting seriously ill but the game has changed with delta. I wish it wasn't so but delta is a different beast and we knew it was a possibility. We got lucky with the vaccines that they are effective against delta not as effective as against og covid but still very effective. Delta has shown a possibility of COVID zero is near impossible (take Australia and New Zealand as examples). 

People need to stop thinking about this in binary terms it's not a case of the individual being vaccinated means the virus is somehow nullified, it's about society being vaccinated. I'm getting so sick of it all I wish I could do all the things but it's not about what I want. 

At the beginning before the vaccine we knew the deal stay away from people to help stop healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. One person isn't going to overwhelm anything but everyone having that attitude will. 

Until the world is vaccinated we will remain in this pandemic and shit will be messed up. The quickest easiest way to get to the end of the pandemic is to make sure every person on earth gets the jab. 

It pains me for the artists and crew who need to tour to make ends meet they need support and seeing people like Neil Young stand up and say what he's saying is only right, he can afford not to tour and it's the right thing to do. People like Eric Clapton and Van Morrison can f off they're only doing it for their own bank accounts and they've shown the distain they have for the people who go to their concerts.

I know the post I'm replying to was in jest but I'm sick of it and now that we have the tools to see a way out selfish fools are holding us back. I've made it a point to not listen to bands who've shown themselves to have no regard for anyone else by playing where they shouldn't have.

&gt;A CNN analysis of US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from last month suggests that more than 99.99% of fully vaccinated people have not had a breakthrough case of Covid-19 resulting in hospitalization or death.

This is just so misleading... 90 something percent of unvaccinated people haven't either. 

I don't know what their thinking is here. Yes, you don't want people to think the vaccine isn't worth bothering with. But what's going to happen when you can't hide the need for boosters by mixing it in with data from June, May, and earlier to obscure how much it's really dropped? 

Anyone have preliminary data from August in isolation to see if it's the same or worse than July?

And even [take the table in CDC's favorite paper](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7034e1.htm#F2_down)... notice anything? Those VEs don't match up with the rates; even that paper is showing 89-90% in July; I mean am I wrong, effectiveness = (unvaccinated rate - vaccinated rate) / unvaccinated rate, right? You get 89-90% looking at the last few weeks in isolation, no?

No surprise that if you're hospitalized and have lung scarring, you'd have long-term issues.  Full vaccination takes that risk essentially to zero.  Then if we're talking about long-term debilitating symptoms from mild or asymptomatic infections, it's likely 1% or less.  Probably much less because all these are self-reported.  In any case I wouldn't characterize 1% as ""common.""

This is not a reason to unnecessarily implement booster doses in rich countries.  The proper response to this problem is to help poor countries set up the infrastructure.

&gt; There are plenty of doses in the US that are being thrown out all the time -- those could have already been in the arms of people who want them as a third dose.

Dry air alters salt and water balance in the upper airways and increases the risks of COVID-19 among other respiratory diseases. We explored whether such upper airway variations in salt and water balance might alter respiratory droplet generation and potentially contribute to observed impacts of airway hydration on respiratory disease. In a randomized 4-arm study of 21 healthy human subjects we found that the breathing of humid air, the wearing of cotton masks, and the delivery of (sodium, calcium, and magnesium chloride) salt droplets sized to deposit in the nose, trachea, and main bronchi similarly reduce the exhalation of respiratory droplets by approximately 50% (ùëÉ

Respiratory droplet generation returns to relatively high baseline levels within 60‚Äì90 minutes on return to dry air in all cases other than on exposure to divalent (calcium and magnesium) salts, where suppression continues for 4‚Äì5 hours.

Residents in 14 ‚Äògreen‚Äô wards and living areas are allowed to exercise from 5 to 7am, and one member of a family can go to the market every five days in the ‚Äògreen zone‚Äô area only. Meanwhile, people in ‚Äòrisk zones‚Äô, marked in yellow, can go out for medicine or first aid, but those in ‚Äòred‚Äô or ‚Äòvery high risk‚Äô areas will be in lockdown with delivery services provided by community teams.  
  
The city‚Äôs people‚Äôs committee said frontline forces and local residents have made great efforts during a 20-day lockdown, reducing infection cases in the community from an average of 150 or 200 to 47 per day as of Saturday.  
  
It said 2,400 sources of coronavirus infections (F0) had been cleared in the three-week lockdown with five mass testing programmes.  
  
The city said 480 COVID-19 patients had been released from hospitals on three days from September 3-5, meaning the number of patients recovering from coronavirus reached 980 in a month (from August 25 to September 5).  
  
Doctors from H√≤a Vang field hospital said a mother with COVID-19 gave birth to a boy on August 27, and the mother and son left the hospital on Sunday after nine days of treatment. They will be quarantined at home for two more weeks with medical checks from the local health centre.  
  
According to the city‚Äôs Centre for Disease Control, more than 2,000 medical staff will be mobilised for quick and mass vaccination programmes in the coming days, focusing on residents in ‚Äògreen zones', teachers and labourers in industrial zones.  
It said 180,000 people, including 70,000 workers, had received the first shot, while 55,000 were fully vaccinated.  
  
Local people can post online health declarations or suspected coronavirus symptoms for home testing.  
  
In three days between September 2-4, 550 residents living in ‚Äòvery high risk‚Äô areas in Thanh Kh√™ District had been taken to ‚Äòsafe‚Äô quarantine sites for isolation.  
  
The city will provide VNƒê113 billion (US$4.9 million) in financial aid to support 368,000 households including 66,000 migrant workers and students. The city had allocated the first aid package of VNƒê71 billion to 142,000 households last month.  
  
More than 280,000 students in the city will join online learning programmes in the two first weeks of the new school year from Monday (September 6). The city will exempt school fees in the 2020-21 school term for all students with coronavirus.  
  
The city also set up a hotline to support foreigners working and living in ƒê√† N·∫µng during the lockdown and social distancing orders from late August. Vice director of the city‚Äôs foreign affairs department, Nguy·ªÖn Th√∫y Anh said the hotline had received at least 180 phone calls and emails.

The information was revealed at a meeting on Sunday between Secretary of HCM City Party Committee Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn N√™n and authorities of District 7 which, together with C·ªß Chi District, announced to have kept the pandemic under control.  
  
He said the committee had proposed the city‚Äôs COVID-19 Prevention and Control Steering Committee to choose District 7 and C·ªß Chi District as a pilot to draw lessons for the next steps across the whole city.  
  
Chairman of the District 7 People‚Äôs Committee Ho√†ng Minh Tu·∫•n Anh said the district set up a centre studying socio-economic development models for the new normal period in order to study economic recovery after the pandemic, gradually resuming operation of each kind of business.

These businesses will be initially allowed to operate between 6am-6pm, according to Anh.  
  
The district authorities proposed to consider reducing or exempting tax for businesses and household businesses in 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 and continue support packages for workers to help them recover from difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  
  
Secretary of HCM City Party Committee N√™n stressed that the reopening must be carried out carefully step by step amid the complicated development of the pandemic.  
  
He urged the district to continue carrying out COVID-19 testing, treating COVID-19 patients, vaccinating local residents and ensuring social security for people.

[],,Synonyms26,,,[],,,,text,t2_10wdsu,False,False,[],"H√Ä N·ªòI - Major General, Associate Professor, Dr. Nguy·ªÖn Vi·∫øt L∆∞∆°ng, of the Military Medical Academy, Ministry of National Defence - the unit participating in the trial of home-grown COVID vaccine Nanocovax, has given more details addressing concerns about the vaccine‚Äôs immunogenicity in an interview with the Vietnam News Agency.  
  
On August 29, after a meeting to consider the application for an emergency use licence for Nanocovax by Nanogen Biopharmaceuticals, the Advisory Council for Registration of Circulation of Drugs and Medicinal Ingredients acknowledged the results submitted and appraised by the Legal Subcommittee under the National Institute for Control of Vaccines and Biologicals, the Quality Subcommittee, and by the Pharmacology and Clinical Subcommittee. It also asked the company to urgently supplement and update a number of contents of the quality dossier: safety data on pharmacological and clinical records; immunogenicity in response to new virus strains; and size of samples for immunogenicity assessment according to the research plan; the relationship between vaccine immunogenicity and protective efficacy of at least 50 per cent according to World Health Organization guidelines.  
  
L∆∞∆°ng explained the four important tests to evaluate the immunogenicity of Nanocovax.  
  
L∆∞∆°ng said that the immunogenicity (using quantitative testing of IgG antibodies to COVID-19, which shows the level of antibodies generated after infection or vaccination) of Nanocovax vaccine reached 57.56 u/ml.  
  
L∆∞∆°ng said that in order to compare the IgG antibody levels of vaccines, it must be done using the same unit of measurement (WHO standard unit is BAU/ml). Even to ensure the accuracy of comparison, vaccines must use the same test kit, while here the studies use different types of kits with different units of measurement.  
  
‚ÄúTo evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine must be based on many other criteria, not only on the concentration of IgG antibodies,‚Äù L∆∞∆°ng said.  
  
In the Nanocovax vaccine research, the units used four tests, including a quantitative antibody test; assessment of neutralisation antibody (surrogate neutralisation antibody); assessment of neutralising antibodies on live viruses by PRNT (plaque reduction neutralisation test); and assessment of cell-mediated immunity.  
  
L∆∞∆°ng said that in order to standardise the data to determine the immunogenic effect of the Nanocovax vaccine, researchers could use a comparison method with the sera of people having recovered from COVID-19.  
  
In this study, the results showed that the IgG antibody efficacy of all the serum samples studied in recovered COVID-19 patients was 5.63 u/ml on average. Meanwhile, the IgG of volunteers vaccinated with Nanocovax vaccine (with a dose of 25 mg) reached 6.77 u/ml on ‚Äã‚Äãday 35, 60.47 u/ml on day 42, and fell to 16.25 u/ml on day 90.  
  
The significantly reduced anti-S IgG antibody levels in the vaccinated volunteers, 3.7 times compared to day 42 (from 60.47 u/ml to 16.25 u/ml) were still 2.9 times higher than that in the group of recovered COVID-19 patients (5.63 u/ml).  
  
L∆∞∆°ng added the published figures of the Moderna vaccine showed 5.19 times higher antibody levels in the vaccinated group at the time of peaking (day 42 after injection) compared to the group of recovered COVID-19 patients. The comparable figure for Nanocovax vaccine was 10.74 times.  
  
As for surrogate neutralisation, the results of the study on Nanocovax also showed that the neutralisation rate of serum samples from recovered COVID-19 patients reached 5.68 per cent while that in volunteers injected with Nanocovax vaccine (with a dose of 25 mg) on ‚Äã‚Äãday 35 reached 58.39 per cent, 85.5 per cent on day 42, 72.68 per cent on day 90.  
  
Regarding the decline in antibody levels after the peak, L∆∞∆°ng explained normally the half-life of IgG is about 25 days, which means that for all vaccines after IgG antibody production is stimulated and peaks, the antibody levels will gradually decrease.  
  
‚ÄúThat doesn't mean the vaccine loses its ability to protect. Vaccination helps the body to form specific B cells. This cell will continue to produce antibodies when antigens or viruses enter. This also shows that it is necessary to re-inject the vaccine against COVID-19 after a certain period of time,"" L∆∞∆°ng.  
  
It had been shown in research results published by Moderna regarding its emergency licensed vaccine, L∆∞∆°ng said. With Moderna vaccine antibody concentration decreased 3.96 times on day 119 compared to day 43. By comparison, Nanocovax had a similar reduction of 3.7 times (16.25 u/ml on day 90 versus 60.47 u/ml on day 42).  
  
Yet the antibody level on day 90 in the vaccinated group was still much higher than that in the group of recovered COVID-19 patients (16.25 u/ml versus 5.63 u/ml).  
  
Regarding the two cases of anaphylaxis during testing he said the two incidents among 13,627 volunteers are not a large proportion compared to the claims of many other vaccines. Moreover, these were only grade 1 and grade 2 anaphylaxis, who were promptly treated, have recovered and returned to a completely normal state.  
  
These two cases were also reported to relevant medical authorities according to regulations.  
  
He said when the vaccine candidate had not been officially approved by the licensing council, the publication of data on research results must be agreed upon by the manufacturer and the research and evaluation agencies. This regulation is intended to protect the legitimate interests of manufacturers and agencies participating in evaluation and research as well as to ensure commitments regarding ethical issues in research.  
  
He was concerned that false and unfounded information would not only confuse the public but also directly affect volunteers as well as producers, units, organisations and scientists participating in the research.  
  
L∆∞∆°ng said after reviewing the report on the results of the first two phases and phase 3a of the Nanocovax vaccine trial, the Ethics Council had made a conclusion and transferred the file to the Advisory Council to consider emergency licensing for the Nanocovax vaccine.  
  
‚ÄúThe evaluations and comments of the National Ethics Council in Biomedical Research are correct, fair and objective. Currently, the company and research units have supplemented the required documents. It is hoped that the Nanocovax vaccine will be granted an emergency licence by the Advisory Council for Registration of Circulation of Drugs and Medicinal Ingredients in the first half of September 2021 so Vi·ªát Nam will have an ‚Äòimportant weapon‚Äô in the war against the pandemic, contributing to protecting people's health and soon returning life to a new normal,"" said L∆∞∆°ng. -VNS",,,,1630858016,{},hbp80oz,True,t3_piftej,False,False,t3_piftej,/r/Coronavirus/comments/piftej/vietnam_military_medical_academy_shares/hbp80oz/,1630932175.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,
