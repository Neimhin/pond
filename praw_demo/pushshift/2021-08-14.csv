Authorities hope to reach 600,000 people during the 34-hour event.¬†

In a push to vaccinate all adults before next week, Mayor Ricardo Nunes of S√£o Paulo announced a two-day ‚Äúvaccine marathon‚Äù between 7 am on Saturday (August 14) and 5 pm on Sunday. Between those hours, jabs will be given exclusively to those aged 18 to 21. City Hall hired in ten DJs to entice the younger audience further. Similar campaigns in other states were considered successes.¬†

On Thursday, Brazil surpassed the U.S. in percentage of adults to have received at least one dose ‚Äî¬†74 to 71 percent, respectively. The data comes from coronavirusbra, a big data platform, and the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).¬†

We've already identified several mutations that likely evolved within the United States it has been sheer luck that they haven't been a threat.

The Israeli data that shows Pfizer to not be very effective against infections still shows 88% effectiveness against hospitalization. Meanwhile the latest J&amp;J data shows only 71% effectiveness against hospitalization, so your chances of being hospitalized are over twice that with J&amp;J than Pfizer's.

Somehow, this is being reported in the news as ""New data suggest J. &amp; J. vaccine works against Delta and recipients don‚Äôt need a booster shot."", which I can only imagine is propaganda because they are still trying to make J&amp;J sound enticing to people who aren't vaccinated yet. I can easily see an argument for not needing boosters as it is over the 50% threshold that health organizations use for recommending vaccines, but I think outright saying that boosters aren't needed when the data shows those people are at more than twice the risk for a breakthrough hospitalization is disingenuous.

Fortunately, you are very correct about the dead part, as everything I've seen shows that it is still protecting very well against death.

infection and two specimens were obtained from men 
with no history of infection (all men tested negative 
for COVID-19 via PCR at least 24 hours before the 
operation).

So for some context. Elsewhere in the thread here, the actual study this data comes from is liked. This is an excerpt from the ""Methods and Materials"" sections.

Wow... Uh how is this study... News? The sample size was 2 with a control group of 2. All the patients were old. All the patients were Hispanic (not sure this really matters, but it's definitely not representative). More importantly, this study DOES NOT attempt to make any meaningful observations, by design.

Guys. I know that real evidence of ED in connection with COVID would be a huge boon for vaccine uptake, but we shouldn't let that desire get in the way of the fact that this study shows ZERO data that can be interpreted for or against an ED-COVID connection. It is a pilot study, which is basically saying ""This is how we think a proper study with a much larger and representative sample size should be designed. Here is our methods, and how we conducted our analysis.""

This isn't junk science by any means. But taking a Pilot Study at its word, and repeating it as an actual scientific result is junk science. Let's get a real study looking into this going. Seems like a fairly easy study to conduct as long as you get enough Penile Tissue donors...

I just know this has been the worst summer I can remember. I honestly don't see things changing soon. As things keep getting worse with delta I can't see the more reasonable people coming to visit Florida.

Our study  also  suggests  that  endothelial  dysfunction  from COVID-19  infection  can  contribute  to  resultant  ED. Vascular  integrity  is  necessary  for  erectile  function, and  endothelial  damage  associated  with  COVID-19  is likely  to  affect  the  penile  vascular  flow,  resulting  in impaired  erectile  function.  We  could  not  detect  viral protein  in  penis  tissue  by  immunohistology,  possibly  due to  comparably  low  viral  RNA  load  in  the  penis.  This result  was  not surprising  since  recent studies  show  that COVID-19  isolation  is  unlikely  from  samples  with  low RNA  loads [4].  H&amp;E  staining  from  our  specimens  did  not show  significant  results  compared  to  previous  studies  in which  COVID-19  infection  caused  mild  to  moderate  accumulation  of  lymphomonocytic  inflammatory  cells  in  a perivascular  or  subendothelial  distribution  [5].  Based  on the  current  findings  we  can  draw  two  hypotheses  about how  the  SARS-CoV-2  virus  can  lead  to  the  ED.  First, similar  to  other  complications  related  to  COVID-19,  of ED  can  be  the  result  of  systemic  infection  resulting  in widespread  endothelial  dysfunction.  This  is  supported by  our  findings  of  endothelial  dysfunction  seen  in  men with  COVID  and  ED.  Second,  we  can  also  hypothesize that  the  worsening  of  these  patient‚Äôs  ED  can  be  due  to the  virus‚Äô  presence  within  cavernosal  endothelium  itself.  This  is  best  supported  by  our  findings  with  TEM. The  primary  limitation  of  this  study  were  the  sample size  (n=2)  and  lack  of  objective  quantification  of  erectile function  before  and  after  infection  for  patients  and  controls.  For  now,  history  of  COVID-19  should  be  included in  the  work-up  of  ED  and  positive  findings  should  be investigated  accordingly.  Patients  should  be  aware  of the  potential  complication  of  post-COVID-19  ED.  Any changes  observed  in  erectile  function  after  infection should  be  followed  up with  the  appropriate  specialist for  treatment  and  to  help further  investigation  into  the condition.  Future  studies  are  needed  to  validate  the  effects  of  this  virus  on  sexual  function.",,,,1629019640,{},h90hdy4,False,t3_p4n02l,False,True,t1_h8zv0x9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4n02l/new_studies_show_evidence_of_long_covid_erectile/h90hdy4/,1629089951.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;Karagiannis et al. [22] demonstrated that restricting dietary glucose by feeding mice a HFKD (72% fat, 2.4% sugar) largely ablates lung-resident type 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC-2) and reduces airway inflammation by impairing fatty acid metabolism and the formation of lipid droplets. Chronic activation of ILCs, typical of allergenic airway inflammation, needs exogenous fatty acids which are transiently stored in lipid droplets and therefore converted into phospholipids to promote ILCs proliferation. This metabolic program, imprinted by IL-33 and regulated by the genes Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-Œ≥) and Diacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase 1 (Dgat1), is controlled by glucose availability as well as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Moreover, Goldberg et al. reported that a HFKD allows for better survival and increased protective IL-17-secreting Œ≥Œ¥ T cells in the lungs of mice with influenza virus [10], while Ryu et al. have recently provided preclinical evidence that a HFKD is capable of providing a protective effect against the animal equivalent of COVID-19 in aged mice, with the maintenance of a better oxygen saturation and an increase in Œ≥Œ¥ T cells",,,,1629017968,{},h90fjyv,True,t3_p4o0xv,False,True,t1_h9078km,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4o0xv/ketogenic_diet_as_a_preventive_and_supportive/h90fjyv/,1629089044.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The good news is people in Iceland seem to think they are on the cusp of being done with Corona and this is just infecting the 20% or so left.

Edit to add from an article from the daily beast 

‚ÄúThe 20 percent of Icelanders who didn‚Äôt get vaccinated or haven‚Äôt already had COVID are the ones now catching Delta, with the exception of a few breakthrough cases of vaccinated people. (Children under 16, who aren‚Äôt yet eligible for vaccination, make up most of the unvaccinated group.) A couple thousand people have tested positive in recent weeks, a spike in cases far exceeding the worst weekly case-rates from 2020.

But hospitalizations have not surged to the same degree as cases in this latest Icelandic surge. That‚Äôs because older Icelanders, as a group, are highly vaccinated. Younger people, who as a group are less vaccinated, are the ones getting infected now. They have a better chance of weathering COVID without serious symptoms.

The US was founded by a group of people who were fleeing religious persecution, but were also brave enough to cross an ocean without really knowing what to expect on the other side and no chance of help coming any time soon if things went sideways. That has fueled an identity of rugged individualism and government mistrust (back then it was the government that doing the persecuting). Combine that with the vast geography, we have a country that stretches across the continent, with seacoast to mountains to vast plains of grass, huge rivers and lakes.

And there's also the local culture, New England was founded by Puritans, work ethic was important as religious observance, and eventually that was replaced by mills and factories fairly quickly in our country's life time so we became densely populated, those people also moved west as the land opened up and the Great Lakes region share many cultural ties with the Northeast. 

Contrast that with the South that remained largely rural until after the Civil War, where one's position in society, politeness, chivalry and religion were important aspects there. Eventually they became industrialized as well but that only happened at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th. The cities there are only just now approaching the density that the North has had for over a century.

And then finally the West, which while settlement along the coast happened fairly early, it was far less populated than the area east of the Mississippi. There were a few Spanish missions and Native settlements but largely it was a vast expanse of open land with settlements several days' ride apart across the interior. Until the discovery of gold, which literally drew thousands of individuals who went west to seek a fortune. It also became an area where criminals seeking to escape the law after the Civil War went because it was so sparsely populated. Law and order were non-existent in most places, if you didn't have your own gun, you'd be robbed or worse, wind up dead. The southern end was desert and the northern end a vast prairie where nothing but drought resistant prairie grass grew and huge buffalo herds wandered about, at one time it was called the Great American Desert. It really wasn't until the late 19th century that it was linked with the rest of the country by the transcontinental railroad, and even then took until the 20th century before those vast wheat and corn fields we have today existed after public works allowed for irrigation of farmland.

So you can see we really aren't a homogeneous group of people but a heterogeneous one, not even counting the immigrants that have come since this country was founded. We share some commonalities but also have vast differences. The people of the Northeast always seem to be in a rush in the eyes of a Southerner because of our work ethic, while conversely we view them as taking too long to do anything because of their ideal of politeness while those in the West are mavericks willing to blaze their own trail. Sure there has been some mixing and urban areas share more in common with each other than rural areas and vice versa but largely each region is unto itself like a separate country with the history and why people came shaping what we see today. To get people to agree to do anything barring an outside threat like a foreign adversary or an attack is nearly impossible. And then there is the undercurrent of individualism and mistrust in government that while unites us all in some ways, also causes some fracturing of the seams. What some people view as acceptable is an abomination that must be destroyed to others.

It's never a question of money here, it's always a question of will and we just don't have the political will to do something like contact tracing on a broad scale.

Worst of all though, I get these weird feelings in my lower chest and sometimes the side of my chest. It‚Äôs not a pain and doesn‚Äôt outright ‚Äúhurt‚Äù so much as it just feels really awkward. 

My doctor ordered X-rays and found nothing. Is anyone else experiencing these weird feelings in their chest/abdomen?",,,,1629046441,{},h91sv7r,False,t3_p4orwp,False,False,t3_p4orwp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4orwp/daily_discussion_thread_august_15_2021/h91sv7r/,1629113408.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients that need to be hospitalized and can't be admitted, **WILL DIE, not some, not most, ALL.**  Every person who needs to be in a hospital and can't be admitted **WILL DIE**.

That person who can't be admitted to the hospital will go home and the family will be forced to care for them, and watch them die.    Since the family will be trapped in the home with a very sick person, it will be almost impossible to keep everyone in that house from also getting sick.

Now everyone in that house is sick, passing the viral load back and forth to each other, and since the hospitals can only accept patients as patients die or recover it means with the explosion of cases the vast majority of people who need to be in the hospital won't be in the hospital, which means the death rate for the Delta variant will skyrocket.

Regarding that study, it has been observed that the measured effectiveness numbers were variable over the course of the study, and in particular, were seen to go down and then back up again (Moderna between June and July), defying a simple ‚Äúit‚Äôs getting worse‚Äù narrative. I have yet to see an explanation or this, but it has caused some people to question the source of this variability and whether there is some confounding factor unaccounted for in the study. On a related note, confidence intervals for the ~50% range numbers (Moderna in June, Pfizer in July) are rather large (as much as 12-85% in some cases).

I‚Äôm also perplexed as to why the study didn‚Äôt match for age.  It would seem that those who got their shot earlier in the year were likely to be older.

But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

&gt; But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

Like any group, not everyone is in the same place--but as to a majority--I'd chalk it up more to a media diet that for many bleeds over to perceptions of faith.

It is rare to find anyone who agrees 100% with a religion or large ideological group they associate with.  People may claim they do, but actions say otherwise.

There have been many recent official statements that are followed with exactness or downplayed by members depending on what their political leaning was.

For example: Conservative members were all for an official statement on prop 8 in California and often pushed people to take an anti gay marriage stance.  The same people were quiet and had a lot of buts and excepts to a later official statement supporting equal LGBTQ+ rights for housing, employment, social services, etc.

When Trump was running, his statements or actions were sometimes followed with official statements.  They never mentioned him by name, but the timing was highly unusual.  In 2015 Trump and Cruz called for policing Muslim neighborhoods and restricting immigration based on religion and immediately afterward [out comes an official statement warning of the erosion of liberty and supporting freedom of religio](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/publicstatement-on-religious-freedom-and-nondiscrimination)n.

Later Trump begins touting the separation of children from parents at the border and a few official [statements condemning the practice and calling for a path to citizenship are released](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/church-calls-for-unity-compassion-in-new-statement-on-immigration?lang=eng).

There are more where these came from as well as **plenty** that clearly support positions that align more easily with conservatism.

Catholics do the same. Support the pope--but the American Conferences of Bishops ignored his request not to consider denying communion to pro choice politicians.

People are people.

So, how is the local ward  (congregation) leadership dealing with the letter on Covid?  They're waiting for further clarification before making changes (going back to masks and social distancing) to meetings.... ??

As I said above, participating in society means accepting certain responsibilities. This is one of those responsibilities. Unfortunately, it seems like a ton of adults never actually learned how to be responsible, and so society may have to treat them like children, forcing them to take their damn medicine if they want to be allowed to go play with their friends.",,,,1628997104,{},h8zm9jy,False,t3_p4jtkj,False,False,t1_h8zijy0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4jtkj/americas_coronavirus_outbreak_is_now_a_patchwork/h8zm9jy/,1629073817.0,21,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like, I watched a video once of a guy who bought a SawStop saw, which has a mechanism that instantly stops the blade if your finger touches it. If the mechanism goes off, you have to replace the blade and the safety cartridge, which is $100-200 worth of hardware, but that's nothing compared to a finger. 

And yet, says the guy in the video, if anything, getting the saw has made him think about it even more when he turns it on, because he knows exactly what it will feel like if he needs to stop working and spend the rest of the day buying new stuff, figuring out how to swap it in, and recalibrating the saw. His fun day of making birdhouses or whatever just turned into a total downer.

Going to the hospital and having a finger reattached and all the associated trauma, and even the gigantic medical bill, those are thought about the way you think about getting hit by a speeding bus - sure, it could happen, but you're not going to plan your life around that possibility. But losing one or two whole days to useless work and losing about one day's wages, that's something we've all generally experienced more than once, and we never want to feel that way, and that weirdly *feels* like a much bigger, or at least a more present threat, according to the Sawstop-owning video guy.",,,,1629024244,{},h90mo7u,False,t3_p45lfi,False,True,t1_h8wg2w1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p45lfi/take_it_from_them_americans_hospitalized_with/h90mo7u/,1629092631.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is true but I don't think this can be generalised to a 'stronger' immune system overall. Kids are more susceptible to many diseases (ie whooping cough) for other reasons. It's more accurate to say young kid's immune systems are different and it helps in some ways and hurts in others. 


The whole idea of a strong or boosted immune system is not a good one as the immune system is complex and is a balancing act between over-reacting and under-reacting. An immune system can be disfunctional, the most obvious example in people that are immunosuppressed, but the idea of an immune system being weak vs strong isn't a useful concept.",,,,1629023744,{},h90m2q9,False,t3_p4gma0,False,False,t1_h8zivq2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4gma0/no_you_cant_be_so_healthy_that_youre_naturally/h90m2q9/,1629092336.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;The rate of new Covid-19 hospitalizations among people in their 30s increased by nearly 300% over the past month, according to an analysis of data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
New Covid-19 hospital admissions among people between the ages of 30 and 39 are now the highest since the pandemic began, eclipsing the prior record seen in January, according to the data.

&gt;The alarming uptick is stretching health resources thin as many hospitals struggle to meet the demand of those who need crucial medical care.

&gt;‚ÄùThe system is breaking,"" CNN medical analyst, Dr. Jonathan Reiner, told CNN's Jim Acosta Saturday.
""It's not just the beds. Many hospitals can find beds in places like parking structures or cafeterias. But it's qualified people to staff those beds. And the United States is critically short on ICU nurses, so finding the qualified staff to take care of critically ill patients becomes increasingly hard,"" said Reiner, a professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University.

Hospital admissions of the elderly also have jumped in Louisiana and Mississippi.

Vaccines are still proving highly effective at protecting the inoculated from severe disease, even with the fast-spreading delta variant. But the virus is finding ways to circulate as menacingly as ever. The toll on many hospitals has been devastating.

‚ÄúWhat this underscores is the degree to which there is so much more transmission with the delta variant,‚Äù said University of South Florida epidemiologist Jason Salemi. ‚ÄúWhen you have spread that is that pronounced, it is going to find those vulnerable people.‚Äù

The numbers speak to the frightening power of the variant. Almost 93% of Florida seniors have had at least one jab, more than the national average of 91%, according to data compiled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Florida hospital administrators still say the vast majority of those hospitalized are unvaccinated. What‚Äôs more, the admissions don‚Äôt mean that seniors today are, on average, getting as ill as they were in previous waves, according to Ali Mokdad, a professor with the University of Washington‚Äôs Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

He said seniors are now more likely to check themselves into a hospital as a precaution for COVID-19, even if they are asymptomatic. Mokdad also underscored that the situation would be much worse in Florida in the absence of the vaccines. ‚ÄúFor the elderly population, it takes less to get them to a hospital,‚Äù he said.

The wave hitting Florida and the Deep South may be close to peaking, but the full consequences of the infections may not be known for weeks as hospital workers try to hold the line.

The effective reproduction number ‚Äî an estimate of the average number of people a single infected person can spread the virus to ‚Äî recently fell below one in Florida and Louisiana. That indicates cases may be poised to decline, according to projections from ‚Äòcovidestim,‚Äô a project with contributors from Yale School of Public Health, Harvard‚Äôs T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Stanford Medicine.

Florida posted an additional 1,071 deaths in the past week, a daily average of 153, according to a weekly report published by the state health department. By comparison, Florida was posting an average of 185 deaths per day last August, Johns Hopkins University data show.

Earlier this month, Governor Ron DeSantis noted Florida‚Äôs COVID-19 mortalities were still trending about 70-75% lower than previous peaks; that gap has since shrunk substantially.

And hospitalizations and deaths typically trail infections.

&gt;‚ÄùJust a couple nights ago, I walked out of the ER and saw ambulances here that weren‚Äôt able to take out patients yet, people on stretchers in the hallways‚Ä¶ People were gasping for air,‚Äù Lee Bond, the CEO of the Singing River Health System, said on the call. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a matter of time before somewhere in our great state someone goes to the ER and is not able to get treated because we don‚Äôt have the arms and legs to do it.‚Äù

&gt;The Mississippi State Department of Health reported 4,412 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, the highest single-day caseload the state has seen throughout the pandemic. This shattered the previous record of 3,488 cases set just two days ago. Physicians say these high daily case numbers will translate to more record hospitalizations in coming weeks.

&gt;The situation in Mississippi hospitals is more dire than it‚Äôs ever been. Top medical professionals began sounding the alarm this week that the Mississippi hospital system could fail in 5-10 days if the current trajectory of new COVID-19 cases continues.

&gt;As of Wednesday, the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, patients in an ICU and patients on ventilators were at pandemic peak.

&gt;The Gulf Coast Business Council hosted State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs and the hospital executives for the virtual meeting on Thursday to answer questions and spell out to local businesses the seriousness of the delta wave.

&gt;Dobbs said the state reported 36 deaths on Monday due to COVID-19 or complications from the virus. Eleven of those deaths were of people under 50, he said. Three of them were in their 20s. Two were pregnant women. All were unvaccinated.

&gt;‚ÄùHad those people been vaccinated, they would not be dead,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNot only would they not be dead, but they would have not had to go to hospital.‚Äù 

&gt;A little over 1 million Mississippians are fully vaccinated, which is about 35% of the state. About 1.3 million people have had at least one vaccine. Mississippi ranks 48th in the nation for vaccine rates. It will take another 1 million Mississippians to get vaccinated before the state reaches any sort of herd immunity, Dobbs said.",,,,1629022459,{},h90klji,True,t3_p4quo4,False,False,t3_p4quo4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4quo4/we_cannot_stretch_anymore_hospital_leaders_on/h90klji/,1629091606.0,77,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

number of children ages 5-11 years included in clinical trials of their COVID-19 vaccines. While 
we appreciate this prudent step to gather more safety data, we urge FDA to carefully consider 
the impact of this decision on the timeline for authorizing a vaccine for this age group. 

In our 
view, the rise of the Delta variant changes the risk-benefit analysis for authorizing vaccines in children. The FDA should strongly consider authorizing these vaccines for children ages 5-11 years based on 
data from the initial enrolled cohort, which are already available, while continuing to follow safety data from 
the expanded cohort in the post-market setting. This approach would not slow down the time to authorization 
of these critically needed vaccines in the 5‚Äì11-year age group.

In addition, as FDA continues to evaluate clinical trial requirements for children under 5 years, we similarly 
urge FDA to carefully consider the impact of its regulatory decisions on further delays in the availability of 
vaccines for this age group. Based on scientific data currently available on COVID-19 vaccines, as well as on 70 
years of vaccinology knowledge in the pediatric population, the Academy believes that clinical trials in these 
children can be safely conducted with a 2-month safety follow-up for participants. Assuming that the 2-month 
safety data does not raise any new safety concerns and that immunogenicity data are supportive of use, we 
believe that this is sufficient for authorization in this and any other age group. Waiting on a 6-month follow-up 
will significantly hinder the ability to reduce the spread of the hyper infectious COVID-19Delta variant among 
this age group, since it would add 4 additional months before an authorization decision can be considered. 
Based on the evidence from the over 340 million doses of COVID-19 doses administered to adults and 
adolescents aged 12-17,as well as among adults 18 and older, there is no biological plausibility for serious 
adverse immunological or inflammatory events to occur more than two months after COVID-19 vaccine 
administration.

If you got skin cancer, would you want your coverage denied because you didn't use sunscreen as a kid (or couldn't prove that you had used sunscreen as an adult) or you lived at higher elevations or closer to the equator? 

A whole lot of diseases can be traced back to poor life choices, but insurance generally does treat/pay for those. 

Please don't misunderstand this as defending antivaxxers and antimaskers. 

They are infuriating and actively harming our country, but I don't think denying them medical care (because refusing to pay for it generally works out to the same thing, since a shit ton of poor people delay or just don't utilize the health care system due to fear of massive bills) is the best stategy to combat the pandemic.",,,,1629049822,{},h92113n,False,t3_p4tknm,False,True,t1_h91wi2g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4tknm/should_the_unvaccinated_be_required_to_pay_for/h92113n/,1629117717.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, if there are 8 million people in the State of Washington, and 12% of them smoke, let's say half a pack a day and the excise tax is $5/pack, that 875 million or so per year. My numbers may be a little off. It's highly unlikely those monies are used for treatment, but if they were, then they've already paid, and then some.

Let‚Äôs assume Covid kills 1% of people, as you stated originally.

Let‚Äôs also assume that if you are admitted to hospital you have perhaps a 5% chance of dying there (1 in 20 people dying who are admitted seems *very* high, but let‚Äôs go with it). 

Now let‚Äôs assume that you are right and every single death caused in error (10%) is caused by an inexperienced nurse (also obviously an overestimate).

Even when we use those overly generous numbers, that means that if you go into hospital you have a 0.5% chance of dying at the hands of an inexperienced nurse - half of your stated Covid risk of 1%. 

To match the the 1% Covid fatality rate you claimed, one in every ten hospital admissions would have to end in death. That of course is nonsense. 

Do you see? Reread your initial sentence, it‚Äôs ludicrous.

Put another way, if you‚Äôre in hospital there is not a 10% chance that you‚Äôre going to die from a medical mistake. If however you are *already dead* lying in the hospital morgue, there is a 10% chance a mistake killed you.

I read the second one also.  A tweet stating get your shots doesn't dazzle me either.  I think the president should have been constantly encouraging people.

He did not enthusiastically tell people what amazing science they really are. At that point, and this one now, it needs to be drilled into people's head due to all the misinformation.

 Did you watch any of the video I linked? I know it's really long. But repeatedly he says get your COVID vaccine. It's safe. It's effective. It's free.  I think he said it at least 4 times.

They do this because R0 is believed to be an estimate the ""core ability"" of the virus to spread and has nothing to do with other factors. It's supposed to be an idealized number.

All said, it's true that R0 is very hard to estimate because of what you need to build into the model, and doesn't always get close to that ""intrinsic property"" that is intended.

Of course, we can't forget the recent phase of huge swaths of commenters here saying ""Fuck the kids, they don't get that sick/can just stay home"" as arguments that vaccinated people shouldn't have to wear masks anymore. 

And well, now we know that with delta, asymptomatic vaccinated people can spread it and suddenly kids actually are filling up the pediatric ICU. Oops. 

And we also now know that only a handful of people were behind a huge disinformation campaign with regards to covid. Some of the ""idiots"" were essentially victims of a huge, coordinated propaganda machine. Some of them listened to the president, who theoretically had their best interest at heart. 

It can be a hard pill to swallow for some people that the president, who supposedly has the best interest of the citizens at heart, absolutely did not. 

I have young relatives who are kind, generally good people. They're succeeding in college and not what I would call idiots. However, even in the face of multiple relatives contacting covid, they still refuse to get the shot ""because it causes infertility."" 

Spoiler alert: it doesn't. But where did they get this idea? The propaganda machine. 

 It's really hard to be charitable in the face of such apparent ignorance, but sometimes I do try to remember that a lot of these people are victims of a massive international and well coordinated disinformation campaign.

Unfortunately I think the problem is accelerating as hospitals are forced to close due to lack of funds and lack of staffing, which leads to even fewer available clinical sites.

Hospital staffing isn't a big issue for most people worried about paychecks and their own job...until they end up in the hospital and it's too late to worry about it.

I think the same could easily be said about the climate crisis or refugee crises, too.  American culture tends to focus on the immediate and the visible to the exclusion of anything long-term or distant, and making a giant culture change happen rapidly is next to impossible (this isn't exclusive to America, but since we're talking about American healthcare it's relevant).  People pay a token amount of attention to climate change and might recycle, but don't give up eating beef or drinking bottled water because that's more immediately convenient or cheap, but the people dying in floods and fires would probably prioritize it.  With the hospitals, we could fund our hospitals outside of donations and elective surgeries so that they can staff adequately for emergencies or additional training, but people would rather their tax dollars went to roads and schools that they see every day.  

I wish there were a quick-turnaround solution that would fix the issues, but until there's pretty drastic cultural *and* resulting systemic change the obstacles are pretty insurmountable.

&gt;Brad Fiscus told NBC News on Saturday that the couple's decision to move to northern Virginia sometime between mid-September and October was initially ""precipitated by the actions of the Tennessee Department of Health"" to fire¬†his wife, Dr. Michelle Fiscus,¬†this summer amid Republican outrage over her push to inoculate teenagers against Covid-19.


&gt;""Since Dr. Fiscus wanted to stay in public health, we were looking at where those opportunities would be,"" Brad Fiscus said.

&gt;As a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics board of directors, Michelle Fiscus already represents Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, and South Carolina.

&gt;""And Virginia, being near D.C., felt like the best place to move,"" her husband said.

&gt;While it was a difficult decision for the couple, who has lived in Tennessee for over two decades, ""it was the right decision,"" Brad Fiscus said, especially after what he experienced during a contentious school board meeting that he took part in Tuesday to discuss mask mandates.

&gt;""We're in an age of misinformation, distrust, and quick to be angry, and quick to protest. And we have sort of shifted out of a timeframe of collaboration, understanding and empathy,"" he added. ""I think maybe the pandemic has turned that up somewhat.""

&gt;Michelle Fiscus formerly served as medical director for vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization programs at the Tennessee Department of Health. She said the state‚Äôs elected leaders put politics over the health of children by firing her for her efforts to get more Tennesseans vaccinated.

&gt;A July letter from the state‚Äôs chief medical officer said Michelle Fiscus should be removed due to complaints about her leadership approach and her handling of a letter explaining vaccination rights of minors for Covid-19 shots, an effort that had GOP lawmakers fuming. Michelle Fiscus issued a point-by-point rebuttal to the letter.

&gt;Fiscus also noted consistent praise for her job performance, including years of performance reviews deeming her work ‚Äúoutstanding,‚Äù most recently for October 2019 through September 2020",,,,1629041450,{},h91gwrz,True,t3_p4veqe,False,True,t3_p4veqe,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4veqe/fired_tennessee_vaccinations_director_planning_to/h91gwrz/,1629107412.0,129,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two weeks ago, I accompanied someone to the hospital bc the doctor sent them with priority based on bloodwork findings. Not knowing what to expect, we grab a quick bite, we take some books to read, a power bank for our phones, the usual stuff for us. We are immediately stopped by a guard and made to look into a tablet that takes our temperature and are asked COVID related questions. We are allowed passage to get her registered to be seen and we take a seat. As we are sitting there, I look around and notice we are in a little section of about nine seats. Everything around us is sectioned off with these clear, plastic framed partitions on wheels. I start paying more attention and I shit you not, every single person on the other side of those partitions in that waiting room, with the exception of 3 or 4 of the maybe 15 to 17 people there, were in wheelchairs. So I tell the accompanying party what I am noticing. Now, I'm not smart. I'm pretty stupid when it comes to things, I'll admit that. It wasn't until a couple came in, that a guy kept jumping out of his wheelchair and hopping from one foot to another and saying ""I gotta stay awake, I can't fall asleep"" that I looked around again and noticed almost everyone in those wheelchairs was asleep. Ok, all these people in wheelchairs, almost everyone sleeping, super creepy and surreal. It was the most quiet and crowded ER waiting room I've ever experienced. 

I try really hard not to freak out and I try to check in with my brain before I respond emotionally to external stimuli and look for other confirmations but today I went to the store to buy food. I felt a lot of how I felt when all of this reared it's ugly head. A lot of food is gone, shelves looked sparse, most people standing away from other people and some even wearing double masks, which I completely understand. 

I don't know why, but even though I was scared then, I feel even more so now. Maybe I'm tired of the uncertainty. Maybe that's what I fear or maybe it's the unknown.

Florida has been consistently lagging behind (the state is patchy and has a lot of extremely red demographics who will never get vaccinated) and it's only in this recent surge where people realized they might actually die did vaccinations really tick up overall. While they'll start to see the benefits of this in a few weeks, it's still 'too little too late' in many ways with the current surge. When Rt was high in early July, I'm pretty sure their vax rate was only in the 30's &amp; 40's, which is obviously a stark contrast from a place like NY having vaccination rates in the 50's, 60's &amp; 70's two weeks prior as what was a preparation for the oncoming Rt increase.

*-However, if you look at what occurred last year--south to north movement of the epidemic and what's occurring now in the UK/Israel with high levels of infection despite a higher level of vaccination, no region is going to escape an infection surge.*

I agree with this, but I think more to my point is that we didn't escape it, we're in it. August is likely it in terms of the ""worst"" for delta. It wouldn't really make sense for delta to hit a place like NY with a decreasing Rt for over a month now only to see the worst of it still yet to come. You're correct that this is going to be ongoing patchy slog with different variables such as weather and behavior patterns with no definitive end in sight, but these waves also follow patterns. When the Rt went above 1 on June 21st it was guaranteed in NY that we were going to see an uptick in cases, and now so long as the Rt continues to fall, even if cases still rise a little every week, once it goes below 1 then we are similarly guaranteed to see the wave drop.

I hope I'm not wrong and that cold weather and being forced indoors doesn't cause a terrible surge, but it's actually incredible how clear vaccination is really showing to be key in terms of our public health measures. With increasing cases I keep expecting to see a huge increase in hospitalizations and our healthcare systems being overwhelmed, but that's just not happening.

[],,chocoholicsoxfan,,,[],,,,text,t2_jr7j8,False,False,[],"I am a physician. I'm in a place where cases are ramping up. In the past 2 days I've admitted 4 COVID+ kids to the hospital. None were there with COVID as the primary reason for admission. For me, the spike was much worse last winter, but as I said, we're only just starting to ramp up now over the past 2-3 weeks. The sickest kid I've seen from COVID was a very obese 17 year old (roughly 400lbs) who required BIPAP, but he did okay. I haven't seen any kids under 10 require so much as a whiff of oxygen unless they had very severe developmental delays compromising their neurologic status. I wouldn't be more scared of COVID for my kids than I would be of the flu- granted, you can get a flu shot every year though the effectiveness can be hit or miss. I haven't seen the Delta variant make kids sicker. I actually wonder if it causes less MIS-C because last December, we were admitting three kids with MIS-C per week, but I haven't seen one since February. If you have an autoimmune history in your family, the complication I would fear the most is COVID being a trigger for Type 1 Diabetes; anecdotally we've seen a LOT of that. One week in December I admitted 18 new onset Type 1s and 15 had some kind of viral trigger. I've taken care of over 20 kids with active cancers who've incidentally tested positive for COVID, and none of them required oxygen, convalescent plasma, steroids, or remdesivir. 


Vaccine trials for kids are obviously awesome but I do want them to be more thorough with kids. No one should be able to say we rushed the trials. We need to be very careful with the littles, especially as COVID poses not a lot of direct risk to them. It does feel frustratingly slow, but I trust that the FDA is doing what it needs to do. I wouldn't try to rush the EUA for kids under 12. All the world's resources are being diverted towards this, and it's telling that *no* country has approved it for kids under 12- that's indicative of the fact that it's not just US inefficiencies causing the issue. In general, not a lot of medications are approved for kids, which can be frustrating, but that's just how it is. 


I've seen a couple kids under 2 months get COVID. Most of them never even actually get a fever. However, if they *do* get a fever, they have to stay in the hospital because for any infant under 60 days, we have to do a full workup and monitor them for 36 hours to make sure they don't have sepsis, even if their fever is likely due to their COVID. Every hospitalized neonate I've seen in COVID was super well appearing and went home after the 36 hour rule out period. So yes they are hospitalized primarily for COVID for safety reasons, but they're not getting that sick from it.

Future generations will develop a stronger inherited immunity but us right now will rely on the vaccine not to die from this. As time goes on with more vaccinations the metric to measure will be less confirmed cases and more hospitalizations and deaths. It is the metric the UK has transitioned to, which I argue is a good transition with the high vaccibation rate there. Deaths have not paralleled the previous spikes as the Delta cases have surged.

&gt;I brought up their knowledge base to say they weren't the ones making medical decisions.

You didn't say that, don't be disingenuous. You said they don't have full medical knowledge, as compared to a doctor, as an excuse for their decision to not get a vaccine. But that simply isn't true, and infection control is a integral part of a nurse's training.

&gt;why I think divisive language is making the antivax movement stronger.

Because mollycoddling and pandering to anti-vaxxers worked so well previously?

&gt;Your comment doesn't have the goal of trying to increase vaccinations, and will actually probably reduce them.

Or, realize that comments will have little impact on vaccination rates and that actions matter far more. In this case, the ultimatum is what will force them to get vaccinated or otherwise.

Once again it was insisted that printers were not mere ‚Äòmechanics‚Äô but men of independent intellect and principle.

[],,ttacottaco,,,[],,,,text,t2_a0xjikn1,False,False,[],"In the U.S. we have about 50% of the population vaccinated, with 3 different somewhat effective vaccines, this is an almost perfect environment to create a super variant.   

**Imagine** we get a variant that has the a combination of the epsilon, lambda, and delta mutations which mean it would basically render the vaccines moot, and it had an Ro of 15-18, a viral load 10x that of Delta, and an incubation period of 14-18 days.  

**The imaginary virus** would be spread ridiculously easy, anything short of an N95 mask would be useless.  The vaccines wouldn't be very effective at all.  People would be infected for 2-3 weeks before knowing that are infected, which means contact tracing would be out the window, and normal precautions would be almost useless.  When people finally did get sick, because the viral load is so high it would hit them like a freight train, during the Spanish flu there were tons of reports of people feeling fine and then 10 minutes later being dead.  

**With that imaginary variant**, by the time people got sick a vast majority of the exposed population would also be infected, in a few day from the first case surfacing, there would be a massive wave of people descending on the hospitals.   

The big danger is when hospitals are full, because that means people who need to be hospitalized aren't being hospitalized, and those who need to be hospitalized who aren't hospitalized, **WILL DIE.  This is how the death rate can climb to 10-20%**.    

The people who can't be admitted to a hospital because of capacity issues will be stuck at home, and their caregivers will be under high stress, which lowers the effectiveness of the immune system, and constant exposure to the virus, which means the caregivers will also get sick, and most likely also die, because there won't be room for most of the sick, this is how entire families are lost.

Also, my state follows CDC recommendations. If an unmasked and at vaccinated child test positive, everyone unvaccinated they expose has to qaurintine, even if the others were wearing masks.

Do you think this might be the breaking point for a lot of people and make them leave the Church?

I don't know where someone would turn if they left over such a disagreement. It's not like they suddenly reject all the other principles of the religion and can just ""turn off"" the rest of their beliefs.

Here is the problem:  Which wins- vaccine/testing mandates, or staffing needs?  The nurses in the Shenandoah valley (even in the hospitals) are mostly PRN (they got their associate's while also getting their high school degree). So these are not the most highly trained of the healthcare professionals.  The ones I know are usually young, married, and their job is just supplemental to their husband's income.  They usually only work for 10 years, then become a stay-at-home mom.  Because the Shenandoah Valley is still stuck in the 1950's.

So the question is:  which is better- to have no nurses (because there is a perpetual nursing shortage) or have unvaccinated nurses?  If you live in DC, you say no nurses.  Because you don't have a severe nursing shortage, and you have choices.  But if you live in Luray, you say unvaccinated nurses.  Because at least there is someone there, manning the phone, taking your blood pressure, etc.  Its better than the alternative.

Because having a nursing student is a huge burden to hospitals and a major stressor to nurses, when hospitals were at their breaking point last year they stopped accepting students.  If your nurses are on the brink of quitting from stress, you don't make them take on someone who is constantly asking questions, needs constant supervision, and can't legally do anything that doesn't reflect on your license as their supervisor..and anything they do do is incredibly slow and requires demonstration.  

So there are plenty of people who are trying to get into nursing school, but some schools have am acceptance rate of 30-50 out of 800 to 1000 applicants, because that's how many students they could reliably place in clinicals *before* COVID.  And you can't get a license if you don't get a set number of clinical hours and prove you can perform at a certain safety standard.

2)  Masking and distancing dramatically helps.  

3)  The hospitals, 18 months in, as part of their core being, still are in no way shape or form ready for a pandemic.

As an actual person admitting kids to the hospital this past year, the *majority* were not there because they were sick with COVID.

I've taken care of dozens of kids with COVID, but can count on two hands the number of times I've needed to give Decadron/remdesivir, which we do for all kids with moderate to severe COVID.

[],,Vlad_Yemerashev,,,[],,,,text,t2_btv8e,False,False,[],"For some things yes (like cancer treatment or plastic surgery) but not for other things (think emergency care where time is of the essence). For example, a rich person who gets in a car wreck in Denver that requires a trauma activation isn't going to be airlifted to, say Calgary. Someone suffering from a stroke or heart attack will likely not make it to their preferred hospital in (insert country name here) if they are wanting to go abroad to their doctor.

And if something goes wrong overseas (infection, mistakes, sub-par facilities resulting in poorer care, etc.), then they are in for a world of hurt. Sure, the ultra rich who are worth 8 digits + will be far more likely to have (or be able to establish) connections to the finest doctors and facilities, but the relatively well off but not quite as wealthy who could go abroad (think software engineers making 150k + a year, a lawyer, etc.) may not have the same recourse. Good luck finding a doctor state side that can fix a botched surgery done by someone abroad or an insurance company that would pay for very expensive corrective procedure(s).

Yes, I know there are accredited hospitals abroad that do have modern facilities and staff who are qualified, but even then things can go wrong. 

**(TLDR) My point is** that there are certain emergency situations where this is not practical. Medical care abroad actually has some risks, and not always because of the facilities and staff (some of which really is top knotch), but because many doctors and insurance companies don't want to touch corrective surgeries with a 10' pole if something went wrong, it will be risky, especially for people who are making good money (working professionals in high paying careers) but not filthy stinking rich (like celebrity / CEO of large multinational levels rich) who would be able to get things fixed easier and without destroying whatever nest egg they have because insurance won't cover the 6-7 figure amount out of pocket to correct it.

I‚Äôm not going to breathe easy until all my kids can be vaccinated and one of the few mercies is that my five year old is my youngest and will be turning six soon - I‚Äôm hoping the next age group that can be vaxxed is the 6-11 range. *crosses fingers*",,,,1629036106,{},h9156oh,False,t3_p4quo4,False,False,t1_h90t4v4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4quo4/we_cannot_stretch_anymore_hospital_leaders_on/h9156oh/,1629101708.0,37,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

*‚Äú(in ancient Greek theatre) a play in which the protagonist, usually a person of importance and outstanding personal qualities, falls to disaster through the combination of a personal failing and circumstances with which he or she cannot deal.‚Äù*

Batson defines tragedy as: ""A narrative form of literature in which a tragic protagonist, who possesses greatness of spirit, commits himself to an undertaking of great magnitude within a given situation and, as a result, comes to spiritual suffering usually followed by perception and death and possibly by 'redemption.' ""

Batson's definition has the following elements:
a narrative form of literature

- protagonist who possess greatness of spirit [Batson does not mean that the protagonist is necessarily admirable for all he or she does, but rather that the hero is elevated in human potential.]

- protagonist commits himself or herself to an undertaking of great magnitude

- protagonist comes to spiritual suffering {Keep in mind that ""spiritual"" need not be ""holy"" here.]

- the suffering is usually followed by perception and death

- possibly, the suffering results in redemption

After looking into the data, China's Sinovac has proven to be quite effective at saving lives, cases in certain areas have dropped to 0 a couple days ago. It is also the safest vaccine than other choices as it is using proven vaccine technologies that has been used for decades. It's also safe to administer it to children as early as age 2 without any heart inflammation or blood clotting issues.

The whole concept of insurance is precisely that costs are ""shifted"" onto other people. It's a contract people sign that says: if one of us gets sick, we all chip in. The insurance company is just the middleman who takes a cut in exchange for facilitating this transaction. Insurance companies should be able to form separate ""cohorts"" of people and set different insurance rates for each. If this idea makes you uncomfortable, then perhaps one can start with regulations that prohibit companies from setting different rates on the basis of some protected categories like race or congenital conditions.

But absolutely, I think it's completely fair to charge higher rates to people who make unhealthy life choices. (Just as unsafe drivers have to face higher car insurance rates.) In the present case, make the unvaccinated pay more to cover the medical bills of their cohort (so that vaccinated people don't have to see their premiums increase for no fault of their own).",,,,1629047587,{},h91vmqt,False,t3_p4tknm,False,True,t1_h91b4jt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4tknm/should_the_unvaccinated_be_required_to_pay_for/h91vmqt/,1629114838.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,Xarama,,,[],,,,text,t2_wnp70,False,False,,"&gt;why are you able to catch and die from something you are supposed to be vaccinated against?

Because the virus continues to mutate and change, as viruses like to do. It's true that the vaccines are not as helpful against the Delta variant as they were against earlier variants of the virus, but they are still quite helpful. Unvaccinated people still have a much higher risk both of getting infected, and also of getting more severely ill. 

The more people remain unvaccinated, the more people will get infected faster -- and every additional infected person means an additional opportunity for a mutation like Delta to appear. 

Delta is significantly more infectious than earlier forms of this coronavirus. It's a more advanced, more dangerous version of the virus than what was circulating at the time the vaccines were developed. The vaccines were tailored to three version of the virus that was circulating at the time, so it's most protective against those earlier versions. This is why the vaccines don't protect us quite as well against Delta as they did against earlier variants. But as I said: the vaccine still protects people, it just is somewhat less protective than before. 

The longer we allow the virus to circulate unchecked by having half the population unvaccinated, the faster it will mutate and create even more dangerous versions of itself. Every new mutation could make the vaccines less and less effective. It's literally a race of the virus mutating vs. people getting vaccinated.",,,,1629047215,{},h91uqar,False,t3_p4tknm,False,True,t1_h914s0h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4tknm/should_the_unvaccinated_be_required_to_pay_for/h91uqar/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,c1f053eea786d60c517f5b8ca8edb1b513d57a84,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1629047233.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

This remains correct. But cannot happen until full FDA approval. As soon as that occurs, the vaccine makers will be allowed to modify as events and new variants dictate, much like we currently see with the flu shot.

Another key in this process is getting approval for kids. When those two things are in place we should see pretty quick rollouts of annual or seasonal boosters, which will help a lot. But only if people take the shot.

If current numbers of refusals continue, this is going to last many years as local epidemics and worldwide as an endemic. On top of all that, we still have something like 80% of the global populace who simply have no access at all.

[],,nycphotogrl1,,,[],,,,text,t2_wem82ut,False,False,,"&gt;Why would this not happen?

Because we have high vaccination rates. Implying that the NE is just waiting for a beast of a surge is not taking the overall (positive) impact of vaccination into consideration. 

Yes, there will be individual instances of breakthrough cases (moving forward and especially during this current surge) but when we look at the course of a pandemic, it's not about measuring the impact of a virus' course because your cousin got covid even while fully vaccinated, we need to look at patterns in absolute numbers. Vaccinated people may still be able to spread delta just as much as those who are unvaccinated, but their odds of getting infected *in the first* place are still significantly lower, as well as the duration of which they are infected is *much* shorter...thus vaccination still has a massive impact on total public health outcomes.

I live in NYC and we don't actually need to look at ""nuance"" to just know that we are going through a 'hump' rather than a scary surge (like Florida and Texas) because we have high vaccination rates. Therefore the impact of delta (while still not ideal) is still far less severe and is and not overwhelming to our healthcare systems. Believe me, I was here throughout the entire ordeal and I know what horrific pre-vaccine surges looks like, and this aint it. 

The Rt in [NY](https://covidestim.org/us/NY) is not below 1 *yet*, but it's quickly headed there in the next two weeks, which means that what we're seeing in North Eastern places like NY right now is basically the 'worst' of it as far as Delta is concerned (it's essentially endemic for us.) That doesn't mean we won't still have issues moving forward for years with covid, hot spots will always be prevalent and flu season will mesh with it... but unless another variant rears it's head and KO's delta, then the country as a whole is also on the verge of having this become endemic. Places like Florida and Missouri's Rt is falling below 1 as of this week, which means they're going to be out of this mess by September or even the end of August.",,,,1629055815,{},h92ew5q,False,t3_p4orwp,False,True,t1_h91vwky,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4orwp/daily_discussion_thread_august_15_2021/h92ew5q/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,589f028d4357405277817f701ef35ee114c267b1,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1629055827.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Are there really perfectly equal odds between a poor POC and poor white person to get the parking garage bed? To even get a bed? I mean I'm sure they're doing their best there but...)  

There seem to be several ways to proceed with encouraging vaccination / implementation of NPIs:

1) Do nothing different than today (full disclosure - I honestly believe the US will end up doing this so all of this is a bit of a null discussion)

I do think that there is a strong data averaging problem with some of these surveys which is going to make it very hard to have any universal answer. 

I do believe your argument that in Chicago (and a lot of metros), access is likely the #1 issue. I think that this can likely be solved with money and sensitive community engagement.  Hopefully, local governments are aware of that and are working on that.  This seems like a challenging but solvable one.

I do think that in large parts of the country, particularly rurally, access isn't as much of an issue and it is political / ideological (I get why you wouldn't want to believe that and I wouldn't either if I hadn't been told point blank multiple times). At least from a rural perspective, we have hospitals, clinics, in my hometown the hospital would send someone to come give you a shot at your house if you needed it and our vax levels are still low. There are just no incentives for them to get shots and a lot of disincentives (e.g., socially with group identity). I don't think you can fix this without involving money and even then I don't know that this works. So honestly, most of us who engage here are frustrated because there seems to be a lack of any reasonable path forward.  

I mean think about your most deeply held identify, now imagine being perceived to be completely turning your back on that and everyone in your community with the same identity.  It would be hard. Overwhelming the hospital system seems to be helping boost rates (which may either be because it was never an access issue or because it's changed the incentives to be more important to do, not sure) I really hope that's not the best answer because it's leading to a lot of needless suffering.

2) Local mandates - This seems like the best way to enforce because they could be uniquely tailored to the situation.  I think cities like Chicago could do really interesting and creative things here with the right funding. Won't work in a lot of states because of state laws restricting mask and vaccine mandates.

 3) State mandates - This would be tougher because it's broader, but would allow coverage over more rural populations, so for states with smaller rural populations, this could be a path to push vaccinations.  Likely that Illinois could also do good this way. Not feasible in most of the South

4) Federal mandates - Only potential for limited application and enforcement, e.g., in the military.  A military vaccination mandate would likely do a lot of good for the South because of the number of military bases and would be in line with previous rulings.  This is likely the most feasible path forward for the federal government.

5) Private company mandates - For some reason, we seem to have differed here, so this is likely where any mandates will be broadly implemented.

&gt;No U.S. decision has been made because cases here so far still indicate that people remain highly protected from COVID-19, including the delta variant, after receiving the two-dose Pfizer or Moderna regimen or the one-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.

&gt;But U.S. health officials made clear Sunday they are preparing for the possibility that the time for boosters may come sooner than later.

&gt;‚ÄúThere is a concern that the vaccine may start to wane in its effectiveness,‚Äù Collins said. ‚ÄúAnd delta is a nasty one for us to try to deal with. The combination of those two means we may need boosters, maybe beginning first with health care providers, as well as people in nursing homes, and then gradually moving forward‚Äù with others, such as older Americans.

&gt;He said because the delta variant only started hitting the U.S. hard in July, the ‚Äúnext couple of weeks‚Äù of case data will help the U.S. make a decision.

&gt;Moderna President Stephen Hoge said seeing some ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù infections emerge among the vaccinated within six months has been surprising, even if most symptoms so far have not been life-threatening. ‚ÄúI think that suggests we are going to need booster vaccines to get through the winter,‚Äù he said.

&gt;Last week, the Food and Drug Administration said p eople with weakened immune systemscan get an extra dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines to better protect them as the delta variant continues to surge.

&gt;‚ÄúIf it turns out as the data come in, we see we do need to give an additional dose to people in nursing homes, actually, or people who are elderly, we will be absolutely prepared to do that very quickly,‚Äù said Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is President Joe Biden‚Äôs chief medical adviser.

&gt;While the U.S. currently is seeing an average of about 129,000 new infections a day ‚Äî a 700% increase from the beginning of July ‚Äî that number could jump in the next couple weeks to 200,000, a level not seen since among the pandemic‚Äôs worst days in January and February, Collins said.

&gt;Both he and Fauci stressed that the best way to stem the virus is for the unvaccinated to get their shots.

&gt;Currently, about 60% of the U.S. population has gotten at least one dose and nearly 51% are fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Preventio n.

I don't think anyone seriously believes that this is the real number, but it is the best that we have.

[Here](https://twitter.com/farzad_md/status/1420526578505818113) is a very interesting Twitter thread on this (by an expert) with a proposal for a better experiment to look at this.

I certainly agree with your general point, and nobody should say that there's ""no risk"" to the vaccinated, but I do believe that--at this point--the vaccinated should be able to make informed choices about how much risk they can tolerate, up to and including going to lollapalooza (though I personally would still avoid an event like that).

The other thing to keep in mind is that, in all likelihood, we are *all* going to end up with many breakthrough covid infections over our lifetime.  Antibodies will always wane (and we basically want them to fade--our blood can't have unlimited protein in it), and our memory t and b cells won't stop us from getting sick altogether, but they will keep us out of the hospital.

The question is really whether we think there will be some major advance (nasal vaccines? etc.) in the next year that we can use to give even stronger protection against symptomatic disease, but I personally doubt anything like that will happen in that timescale.",,,,1629055651,{},h92eiuk,False,t3_p4pwxj,False,True,t1_h912z89,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4pwxj/should_americans_be_worried_experts_say_socalled/h92eiuk/,1629125289.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Longitudinal study from Mayo Clinic on relative effectiveness of Pfizer vs Moderna: During the course of the study 94 vaccinated individuals from Wisconsin, Arizona, Florida, and Iowa who became infected required hospitalization, including 13 who were admitted to ICU and 1 death.

I had two doses of the Moderna several months back. Now, don't get me wrong, I absolutely don't want to take a dose from someone who is still trying to get their initial vaccination. But my state is right now throwing out thousands of doses. 

Again, I don't want to take a vaccine from someone who still needs their initial dose. But there are doses literally being thrown in the trash. Earlier in the year, the county kept a wait list of those who weren't in the most critical groups, but who could be called in if there were extra doses available at the end of the day. So if you were say, 30 and healthy, but 65+ were being prioritized, you could get a dose if they had extra left over. 

We absolutely should be doing this for booster shots. We don't absolutely know if they're 100% necessary, but they certainly don't hurt. The CDC should be encouraging counties to offer extra doses to those wanting a booster.

But instead, they're playing the same paternalistic BS they did at the start of the pandemic. They don't want people to interpret ""you can get a booster"" with ""you need a booster.""

Countries with effective poliovirus immunization protocols and younger populations have fewer and less pathogenic cases of COVID-19. Antibodies to poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2 were found in pediatric sera and in sera from adults recently immunized with polio. Sera from polio-immunized individuals inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cell cultures. These results suggest the anti-D3-pol-antibody, induced by poliovirus vaccination, may provide a similar degree of protection from SARS-CoV-2 to adults as to children.
  
&gt;**Conclusions:**¬†Poliovirus vaccination induces an adaptive humoral immune response. Antibodies created by poliovirus vaccination bind the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein of both poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2, thereby preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection.

I just wonder if anyone ever floated the possibility of have at least one major hospital that refused to accept any covid positive patients, so that the vaccinated who have need of medical care can get it. If that's even a plausible thing.   Test before admittance to an emergency room.  

My personal experience is doing everything possible to avoid the vaccine because my spouse has cancer, needed surgery, and multiple tests.  I spent over 8 hours in a freezing (sub zero) parking garage because I wasn't allowed inside with my spouse while he had multiple visits and tests.  No visitors, no waiting area for family.  We don't live in town and there is no place to go. Last winter. It sucked, our state's numbers were high but thankfully we were able to have the surgery, the chemo prior to and currently post surgery chemo. 

 I am thinking of all of those families who have done the right thing and it's like ignore everything else and focus *only* on Covid-19.  Why?  Why not dedicate one hospital in a region where urgent care for the uninfected and vaccinated can go?  Where the people who work to save lives and to preserve health are not utilized as sacrificial lambs.   

I have had cancer, my spouse has cancer, and we have had excellent care at our  nearby major teaching Hospital. Many wonderful technicians, nurses, Residents and Doctors.  We feel for you, we feel for those who are doing the best they can.  We worry that someone in our situation will not be able to get their surgery before the cancer spreads further.  Or other necessary surgery. We were at the last stage before spreading further and hopefully it hasn't. Based on all the tests we think we have an excellent chance, but if we had an earlier Covid surge, the surgery would have been postponed. I cannot tell you how angry I was at people's utter selfishness.  Not just for us, but for all the people in Health care who have been working long hours for over a year. Who have possibly been sick from this virus and are looking at maybe even a reinfection because of all the nonsense that has gone on.  Who have family they dare not get sick. 

Not enough masks, people who just refuse to do the bare minimum to keep from being infected.  It's really infuriating and I for one do not blame you for saying enough is enough.  I am also thankful for those who hang in there, but honestly, I would have probably said to hell with it, if it were me at this point in time.  At some point, you have to help yourself. If there is a vaccine, just get it already.

I would like to add, since there are probably still some of my generation working (or they've returned), that there used to be diploma programs run by hospitals. Mine was 3 years. My program, plus the associate and bachelor degrees, would all qualify someone to take the RN licensing exam. I don't know if that's still true - the exam has changed (mine was state run; I believe it's national now) - but if it is, then there's more than one way to qualify for it. The exam is what gets you the RN license, which you need in order to work as a nurse.

same time. 

We believe that when the prophets and apostles get together and come out with messages like this that it is inspired by God. (Not everything the leadership says would be considered ""gospel"" because they are fallible people like anyone of us. I.e. there are books that previous apostles of the church have written, but they wouldn't be considered 100% rule or gospel since it wasn't approved by *all* the the current leadership. It would be more like  good advice/reading than gospel).

That being said, this announcement was approved by them all. This would be considered inspired of God. Those who claim they trust in the prophets, but don't follow this don't actually trust in the prophets and apostles. Basically they have little faith. 

I also consider this more important than other guidances. I.e. members are supposed to try their best to be like Christ right? So swearing and crude jokes etc would be considered not following what we are taught. I guess the difference to me would be: swearing every now and then doesn't out others life in danger. You can improve yourself overtime. Not getting a vaccination or wearing a mask when you should is actively putting other people's life's in danger.

--

That being said I am 100% not surprised that there is pushback from people. If it brings them to leave the church they are just proving themselves to be tares (parable of wheat and tares). 

There's a pretty large problem when it comes to the culture of areas with a high amount of LDS members. The church becomes more of a status symbol to them then a religious practice. A general ""holier than thou"" vibe can run rampant in these areas (Kaysville Utah I'm looking at you). This is very obviously contrary to what the church, gospel, and scriptures teach. Christ taught us to love everyone. Help others out of the goodness of our hearts and not be like the Pharisees who were donating lots money to show everyone how much money they have and how awesome they are. 

It's not necessarily unique to the LDS church and it's not the church's fault. Things slowly start to become tradition and greed takes ahold of people. They begin teaching their kids and their friends to do thing x when really thing x is not taught nor condoned by the church. I.e some local leader (like a bishop or similar) was telling people not to let their kids stay the night at a friend's house. This eventually became really common among some Mormon families.

The church has stepped up their game recently and are trying to combat it. Lots of members I know tend to be right leaning and don't like things like immigration and helping refugees even though Christ very specifically taught us to help everyone even if we don't like them. (You fed me and clothed me... Parable of the simaritan, etc). The church has amended parts of the [general handbook](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/title-page?lang=eng) to be more specific. They have a [webpage dedicated to refugees](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/refugees) now. 

Good addition in the handbook: ""Church members offer their time, talents, and friendship to welcome immigrants and refugees as members of their communities.""

Additionally, many healthy people cannot get the vaccine yet at this time, including children and pregnant women. 

Obviously being healthy and talking preventative steps suggested by the CDC will lower your chance of contracting COVID, but they still won‚Äôt keep anyone completely safe. 

Here‚Äôs some summarized data from an actual source: 

&gt; neutralization levels of vaccinated sera are lower against the Delta variant compared to the original strain.

&gt; Data indicate that Delta is 40-60% more transmissible than Alpha and almost twice as transmissible as the original Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2. 

&gt; The study, which was conducted in the U.K., reported an 88% efficacy against Delta after 2 doses of mRNA vaccine, but only 30.7% efficacy after 1 dose

&gt; Out of the 469 identified cases of COVID-19, 346 or 74% of them were breakthrough infections that occurred in people who were fully vaccinated with 2 doses of Pfizer or Moderna, or 1 dose of the J&amp;J vaccine. Genomic analysis revealed that Delta was responsible for 90% of the 133 sequenced breakthrough infections. This information prompted the CDC to recommend the use of masks in indoor public spaces, regardless of vaccination status, in areas where COVID-19 transmission is high

At this time, in a macro sense getting Covid is a bit more concerning than getting a cold. It spreads a lot easier, so if you‚Äôre infected and you‚Äôre around someone that‚Äôs vulnerable, chances are they‚Äôre gonna get it, and that can get pretty bad, clearly. When Covid puts someone in the hospital that person tends to remain there a lot longer than with flu or other diseases. We‚Äôre talking two week stays, iirc if you do get hospitalized from flu it‚Äôs 3-5 days on average. You see a lot about 80% icu capacity, and while it is true that hospitals reach that point in the winter, with Covid that effectively doubles the number of actual beds needed- ordinarily you can just count on those beds being turned around.

Secondly, on a personal level, a couple things I don‚Äôt like. The biggest one is loss of taste and smell- this is not a usual symptom for colds, it‚Äôs a common one for Covid, even in otherwise mild, head cold like disease. Some people report a quick recovery on that front. Some report changes in how their sense of smell work. It seems to be the longest lingering symptom Covid usually presents- if you‚Äôre having symptoms lasting for six weeks or longer, it‚Äôs probably the lost taste. This isn‚Äôt a world ender- most people with this long term are otherwise completely fine, but a lot of what we enjoy in life is based on taste and smell. It‚Äôd be a shame to lose it. 

I‚Äôm reassured on the next front based on what we know, but questions are still out there: long Covid. I still don‚Äôt know how likely it is for that to happen after vaccination. 

So in short, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs more concerning than just a cold. As for whether or not it‚Äôll be more concerning than the flu in five years, that remains to be seen.",,,,1629059719,{},h92nz6k,False,t3_p4orwp,False,False,t1_h92jds7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4orwp/daily_discussion_thread_august_15_2021/h92nz6k/,1629130834.0,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

I wouldn't give Canada too much credit though. Yeah, there's a high vaccination rate here, and lots of vaccine supply. There are also virtually no restrictions in much of the country now, with rapidly increasing Delta variant cases. Instead of really preparing for what could happen with the Delta variant (hospitals being overrun again, more restrictions again), there's likely a Federal election looming - which is looking like a rush to campaign on recent success and try to win a majority before having to explain how we managed to fall into yet another bad situation.

It‚Äôs grift to want to be compensated fairly for the 11 years of brutal secondary education you had to go through to become a doctor?

Strange position.

There‚Äôs only one other careerfield that is only employed by the federal government, Air Traffic Controllers.

Those guys, unlike doctors, are allowed to unionize.

They net more per hour than primary care doctors.

They get vacation days, and holidays, and even a special version of retirement that is better than any other federal employee.

None of that is being offered to doctors who would be defacto employees of the federal government with no where else to offer their services and strict laws making it illegal to accept something other than Medicare for an encounter if they accept Medicare.

Furthermore M4A treats all doctors of a given speciality as the same. So a doctor who is more throughout, what you want in a primary care doctor, gets the same for a given encounter as a doctor who gives you 5 minutes and sends you on your way.

In a letter sent to the U.S. President, the CEOs of companies like Adidas, Coach, Gap, Hanesbrands, Nike, VF and Under Amour have emphasized that Vietnam is an important economic and supply chain partner of the U.S.  
  
According to the Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association (Vitas), the corporate honchos have stressed that the U.S. is best placed to provide the support needed to keep the supply chain going.

Vietnam ""is now the second largest supplier of apparel, footwear, and travel goods to the U.S. market. Further, Vietnam has become a major supplier of crucial inputs for America‚Äôs small but important footwear manufacturing industry,"" the letter says, adding about 3 million U.S. workers are connected - through the value chains - to many millions more in Vietnam.  
  
""The health of our industry is directly dependent on the health of Vietnam‚Äôs industry.""  
  
The CEOs have asked President Biden to accelerate the donation of vaccines and other materials to help keep Vietnam on a strong footing so it can quickly recover, noting that the crisis of their employees in Vietnam is also their crisis.  
  
On August 10, representatives of Vitas and the Vietnam Leather, Footwear and Handbag Association (Lefaso) had a meeting with the CEOs on how to procure more vaccines and resume production.  
  
Vitas also hoped that the ""health"" of the supply chain between Vietnam and the U.S. will be discussed in the upcoming trip of Vice President Kamala Harris to Vietnam later this month, so solutions to protect the supply chain can be implemented in September.  
  
Last month, the American Apparel &amp; Footwear Association (AAFA) requested the U.S. and Vietnamese governments to speed up the distribution of vaccines to major suppliers of Adidas, Gap, and other brands.  
  
The U.S. has so far given 5 million doses of Moderna vaccines to Vietnam through the glocal vaccine mechanism Covax.  
  
Vietnam so far has received 19 million doses of Covid -19 vaccine from the deal with VNVC, the global vaccine access mechanism Covax, and as support from other countries. This includes 11.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, 12,000 doses of Sputnik V, 746,000 doses of Pfizer, more than 5 million doses of Moderna, and 1.5 million doses of Sinopharm vaccine.

Speaking at a meeting to receive goods and necessities for people affected by the pandemic in HCM City, M√£i said the pandemic could become more severe if the city relaxes its vigilance.  
  
‚ÄúTherefore, it‚Äôs essential that social distancing be applied to reduce the number of new cases and gradually bring the city to a 'new normal' state"", he said.  
  
In order to do so, people's awareness is the most important factor, he emphasised.  
  
M√£i said the city has gone 80 days since the fourth wave of infections broke out with the Delta mutation. The period of social distancing, especially the five weeks of tightening Government‚Äôs Directive 16, were ""unprecedentedly difficult"" days for the political system and people.  
  
The city has made great efforts to control outbreaks and infection chains, removing hundreds of locked down areas, promoting control of red zones, as well as expanding green zones. The health sector also cured more than 70,000 people and administered vaccines for over 4.5 million people.  
  
With the spirit of making all efforts to take care of people, the city has tried its best to reduce difficulties, while ensuring the supply of goods and issuing support packages.  
  
M√£i said the pandemic in HCM City has been partially controlled but is still very complicated; the number of infections is still high; the treatment system is overloaded and its operation is not synchronous. The process of receiving and treating COVID-19 cases is sometimes not efficient and the death rate has not decreased.  
  
He said the Government‚Äôs requirement to control the pandemic by September 15 is challenging, but it was the common desire of the people. Leaders of the city affirmed maximum priority towards pandemic prevention, while putting the health and life of the people first and foremost.  
  
To achieve this goal, M√£i said HCM City will focus on implementing four main tasks.  
  
The first is to thoroughly apply social distancing, limiting the source of infection, each person and each household must strictly comply with the requirements of social distancing and the 5K message.  
  
""The pathogen remains widespread in the community, close contacts make it more easy to spread, and that could be very dangerous for people with weak immune systems, the elderly, or those with underlying medical conditions,‚Äù he said.  
  
Secondly, the city takes good care of people's lives in the coming days of social distancing, ensuring people‚Äôs needs for goods and necessities are met.   
  
The city will mobilise all possible resources to deploy welfare packages for the poor, elderly people who live alone, freelance workers who lost their jobs, to ensure the basic life of people until they return to a ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù life.  
  
Third, the city will focus on effective treatment strategies, reducing mortality. The city is expanding the number of hospitals and treatment facilities to meet the needs of emergency, oxygen support, medical care and deploying F0 home treatment.  
  
Fourth, the city is speeding up vaccination to achieve herd immunity. However M√£i emphasised that even when the vaccination rate is high, implementing the 5K message is still a requirement.  
  
The need to impose social distancing for one more month was also noted earlier on Saturday by Secretary of HCM Party Committee Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn N√™n at a conference about assessment of pandemic prevention and control results after two weeks of implementing Directive 12, issued by the HCM City Party Committee's Standing Commission on strengthening several measures to implement the Prime Minister‚Äôs Directive 16 on the prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic in HCM City.  
  
The city has implemented the Prime Minister‚Äôs Directive 16 on social distancing rules since July 9 and started to impose even more restrictions from July 24 to contain spread of the virus.   
  
On July 23, the Municipal People's Committee decided to extend the application of social distancing measures until August 1.  
  
On August 1, the city issued a decision on imposing city-wide social distancing measures under the Prime Minister‚Äôs Directive 16 for an additional 14 days from 0:00 on August 2. ‚Äî VNS",,,,1629043859,{},h91mo3x,True,t3_p4wbu3,False,False,t3_p4wbu3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4wbu3/vietnam_hcm_city_extends_lockdown_for_another/h91mo3x/,1629110276.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,Synonyms26,,,[],,,,text,t2_10wdsu,False,False,[],"HCM CITY ‚Äî A total of 85,608 people in HCM City were vaccinated with Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine (Vero Cell) on Saturday, the municipal Department of Health announced on Sunday.  
  
The doses used are part of the first shipment of 1 million doses of the Chinese vaccine that were imported by HCM City-based Sapharco under the sponsorship of the private group V·∫°n Th·ªãnh Ph√°t and delivered to the southern city last month.  
  
Another one million doses of the 5-million-doses contract arrived at T√¢n S∆°n Nh·∫•t International Airport on Saturday, pending quality controls before being administered.  
  
The department also said that two districts including Ph√∫ Nhu·∫≠n and C·∫ßn Gi·ªù had completed the first dose vaccination for people over 18 years old. Specifically, Ph√∫ Nhu·∫≠n District has a vaccination rate of 152,387 out of 163,961 people, reaching 92.94 per cent of the population. C·∫ßn Gi·ªù District has vaccinated 54,130 people, reaching 97.3 per cent. The district has more than 71,000 people, of which those over 18 years old number more than 59,000.

Tr·∫ßn Th·ªã Xu√¢n H·∫£i and her son had the vaccination at the An H·ªôi Primary School in G√≤ V·∫•p District in an excited mood.  
  
""Before getting the injection, I was told that I was to be vaccinated with Vero Cell vaccine, but I was not worried. I think any type of vaccine is fine as long as the disease could be prevented, and the sooner is the better. The doctor here enthusiastically consulted us about the vaccination and I felt even more reassured. After the injection, I feel that I am still healthy,"" said H·∫£i.  
  
Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng S∆°n, 55, in G√≤ V·∫•p District, said he was advised by the medical staff about the type of vaccine being injected. Believing in the State, he did not hesitate and signed to agree to receive the Vero Cell vaccine.  
Nguy·ªÖn H·ªìng L√¢m, deputy chairman of the Ward 12 People‚Äôs Committee in G√≤ V·∫•p District, said the ward had given clear information about the vaccine and injection work to local residents.  
All of the injection sites were organised well to ensure security and preventive measures.  
HCM City's officials have said that the injection of the vaccines are voluntary and all vaccination sites communicate clearly with the people about the vaccine being offered, amid some hesitancy against the Chinese vaccine, despite it having been approved by WHO and the Vietnamese health ministry.  
On Friday, for example, a video clip circulating online showed people leaving a vaccination site on Huy·ªÅn Tr√¢n C√¥ng Ch√∫a Street, District 1, HCM City, after being told by health workers that AstraZeneca vaccines had run out and only Sinopharm vaccines were left, on the first day of the 1 million shipment being rolled out. HCM City's representative said they are aware of the incident but the administration of Chinese vaccine still continued at the site throughout the day.  
17,916 doses of Sinopharm's vaccine were administered on Friday, according to the city's health authorities.  
To date, Vi·ªát Nam has received 2.5 million doses of Sinopharm vaccines, with the 500,000 doses donated by the Chinese Government in June reserved for people in border areas neighbouring China, Chinese nationals in Vi·ªát Nam, and people who wish to go to China for trade, studying or work, as well as those who have the need for the vaccine.  
HCM City is currently the biggest COVID-19 hot spots with healthcare system straining to deal with the large caseload, and amid global shortage, the city is quickly running out of vaccines to give to its residents.  
Vi·ªát Nam currently relies mostly on Western vaccines, primarily AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer, in its mass vaccination drive. ‚Äî VNS",,,,1629043805,{},h91mjdt,True,t3_p4wb47,False,True,t3_p4wb47,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4wb47/vietnam_85608_people_safely_vaccinated_with_vero/h91mjdt/,1629110211.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Counterpoint - if all it took was education and access, medical professionals should have essentially universal vaccine coverage and be the biggest proponents of vaccines (because they literally work in a place with vaccines and theoretically are ‚Äúeducated‚Äù about them) but there are significant rates of vaccine refusal there although it is likely most strongly dependent on region, particularly in the US. For example Houston Methodist just fired over a hundred workers over this. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/06/22/us/houston-methodist-employees-covid-vaccine-resign-fired/index.html

Also nurse hesitancy seems to be a more common problem that there seems to have been little concerted effort to dismiss:
Survey from American Academy of Family Practitioners on hesitancy (at least initially): https://www.aafp.org/journals/fpm/blogs/inpractice/entry/countering_vaccine_hesitancy.html
A Kaiser survey found higher nurse hesitancy than in the general population and an American Nurses foundation survey found 2/3 of nurses wouldn‚Äôt take the vaccine voluntarily (granted this was from last fall so obviously some more than that got it but still this reads as a giant flashing red sign)
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.myamericannurse.com/nurses-and-vaccine-hesitancy-references/amp/

I highly suspect hesitancy is much higher here in rural Texas, based on some insane comments from nurses here but I can‚Äôt provide empirical evidence on that. Perhaps it would be easier to do targeted mandates for healthcare workers like what Houston Methodist did but at the end of the day, the most important thing to me is ensuring that it‚Äôs safe to take vulnerable family members to the doctor/hospital without the risk of picking up Covid from a healthcare professional and here the only way that that will happen is through insurance premiums.",,,,1629044463,{},h91o48y,False,t3_p4tknm,False,True,t1_h91gfoe,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4tknm/should_the_unvaccinated_be_required_to_pay_for/h91o48y/,1629110990.0,17,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are lots things we could and should be doing:

**Ventilation and indoor air quality**

* The transmission rate outdoors is at least 20 times lower, probably more - the outdoors has an outstanding ‚Äúventilation system‚Äù. This suggests that that there‚Äôs *huge* room for reduction in transmission indoors by improving ventilation and air filtering. So: make a massive push to upgrade ventilation systems. We could start by distributing large numbers of portable CO2 monitors to the public, since that will make the variation in indoor air quality much more visible to the public. That could be beneficial even before many places have improved ventilation: your group could walk into a restaurant, check your C02 monitor, and say, ‚ÄúSorry, your restaurant seems really nice and we‚Äôve read great reviews, but you *really* need to upgrade your ventilation system. We‚Äôll be happy to give you another chance once you‚Äôve announced the upgrade on your website‚Äù.

**Better Masks**

* Why are we still using cloth masks? That recommendation was made when a much less dangerous version of the virus was prevalent, and there was a very limited supply of N95 masks, or even basic medical masks. Now we‚Äôre facing Delta, and we no longer have a limited supply of high quality masks. Using outstandingly effective masks instead seems like a no brainer.

**Better Vaccines, More Vaccines**

* We‚Äôre still using the same vaccine recipe from one and a half years ago, against the original Wuhan variant. Trials for an updated recipe tailored to Delta are either already underway, or will start soon. Let‚Äôs get moving on that, chop chop.
* Nasal vaccines that could provide *sterilizing immunity*, stopping Covid right at the entrance, are in development. If this works it could be a ***VERY*** good thing. This would be a genuine game-changed. Are we sure we can get it to work? No guarantees, but how about a Warp Speed 2.0 with a comparable investment of resources?
* We‚Äôre only on version 1.0.of the mRNA vaccine platform, next generation versions could be *significantly* more effective.
* Have we tested whether giving third dose of the original recipe, an appropriate length of time after the second, could get us back to the level of protection we had against the original strain? That would be fanstastic! But wait, much of the world hasn‚Äôt been able to get even one dose yet! That means we need to:

**Vaccinate the Whole F\*\*\*\*\*\* World**

* We say ‚Äúno-one is safe until all of us are safe‚Äù, but we‚Äôre not acting like we believe that. If we can drastically reduce transmission worldwide, we would expect to see new variants far less frequently, so the situation would be much more manageable. Give Pfizer and Moderna contracts to make, say, 10 billion doses of Delta-tailored vaccines, and just ***carpet-bomb the whole world with vaccines***.

**Vaccine Mandates**

* We can‚Äôt keep screwing around any more, sorry. It‚Äôs unfortunate to have to force people to get a vaccine or be excluded from participating in community life, but we don‚Äôt really have a choice any more. There‚Äôs no more time for half measures. Do we want to live like this forever? This is essentially a war. In past wars we‚Äôve forced people to risk their lives for the cause. In this situation, we‚Äôd be forcing people to ***save*** **their lives**!

Not ""not paying for that"", simply that you don't get certain discounts. For example, if you smoke - which I think already helps with health or life insurance? - you pay a little more. Similar if you engage in or have at least somewhat avoidable health issues.

It didn't touch on issues that are due to addiction: tobacco, drugs, food, whatever, but they were implied. It also didn't supply supporting evidence but did say it wasn't just a hypothesis, and could actually be seen when applied to smoking etc. It was not a huge piece but I would have liked at least something like ""a 2018 study by ...""; perhaps I just missed it. I can see it happening though so it's not incredibly far-fetched and the issues with reaching out to some disadvantaged communities are probably related, if the evidence currently isn't supplied.

(As I understand that there has been progress there; not just having a white male doctor come over and say ""do this"", but that is a component).

The only question I have is what to do about people who are rabidly pursuing, and proselyting, dangerous behavior. This includes but isn't limited to anti-vax for covid. Is there anything we can do about those who aren't just refusing to believe but actually spreading the info? I'm guessing not as it's a real Gordian knot.

Please rephrase this statement. It is incoherent.

&gt;THOUSANDS of vaccine has expired in Alabama and had to be thrown out when instead it could be given to less poorer countries that are in need. 

Ignoring the atrocious sentence structure, I would really like you to understand two things: 

1. There is no effective legal mechanism to transfer property of a state to the federal government, from the federal government to the WHO through the state department, and finally from the WHO to some third word nation in less than 6 months. There are a myriad of laws at the state level that govern how state property is disposed to prevent fraud and these are difficult to work through in an orderly fashion. 

2. The US and Europe have not had the manufacturing capacity of china and India wrt to pharmaceuticals for decades. So comparing the export amount between nations is an invalid metric in this case. A million doses exported from the US or Europe is much more significant than a million doses exported from china (whom manufacturers at a much higher rate courtesy of western investment and outsourcing over the last few decades).  

I know that as a young person you look at cases like this and think it is so simple to give A to E, when in reality you are trying to give something owned by A to B to C to D to E before it expires. Logistics is often the downfall of many good-will ideas.

&gt;China so far has been the most fairest in vaccine distribution, they don't discriminate smaller countries.

I implore you to read a history book. China does few things without an ulterior motive. Go ahead and take a look at their actions in west Africa over the last 20 years and you will, hopefully, understand. China is being generous with their less effective vaccine now because they seek access to the resources of third world countries in the future. Exactly the same as what happened when they ""invested"" in African infrastructure only to gain access to valuable mineral deposits. The mines that china won access to as a result are extremely destructive to the environment and benefit few people in the area that is being absolutely destroyed (the mines are operated by chinese workers and the ore exported to china).",,LOW_SCORE,,1629038869,{},h91b2gz,False,t3_p4qzw5,False,True,t1_h916klf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4qzw5/amid_shortages_africans_scramble_to_be_fully/h91b2gz/,1629104545.0,-7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm as frustrated with the antivaxers and the antimaskers as anybody, but this is a can of worms we really don't want to open. 

Other big ones that people usually say ""Yeah, fuck em!"" Is not paying for cancer treatment for smokers, not treating liver disease for drinkers and not paying for weight related problems for heavy people. 

But where does it end? Not paying for sports injuries (American football players and TBIs, for example) because people were doing something known to cause injuries? Not paying for prenatal care for accidental pregnancies if people aren't using birth control? Not paying for emergency care if people are in at-fault accidents? 

Hell, I have people in my family with asthma and we're currently blanketed with smoke from a forest fire. They're taking precautions (staying indoors, wearing n95s or P100s when they go outside), but if they couldn't or really had to go outside for work or to run errands and ended up in the hospital with asthma complications, would that be an at fault illness and not covered?

You cannot solely look at the world/nation through that filter at all times. Nurses deserve much bigger pay.  Prior to covid they were stretched super thin.  Prior to covid it was an issue/issue in the making. Now with covid its glaringly bad. 

We should never have treating our hospital industry like the food service industry.  Nurses are the waiters, patients and beds are the tables. The administrators are the restaurant manager on duty who spends his time in the office and not on the floor. Guess what- it's a busy night every night and you're many waiters short.  You'll be in the weeds every night.  No help in sight.  Night after night.  Far too many tables (patients) per server (nurse).  Oh you won't be getting any additional money though.

Hospitals have realized (prior to covid) they can serve as many customers as previously, pay less staff.  Increase bottom line.   This level of care should have never been acceptable on the patients' side, or from an employee side on the amount of nurse to patient ratio.  Now we have an even higher demand for nurses, but are losing them in droves as you put it.  What's the plan to replace them?  And this is what my post is about.

Also, if you only had a mild case of covid, or if your immune system is weaker, or just randomly, your immune system might not ""remember"" as much as it should about covid after it finishes fighting it off, leaving you with a weaker resistance. With vaccines, however, the same amount is given to everybody, and you get a more even immune response, and the same strong resistance between almost all people who get it.  
  
So yes, recovering from mild covid could make you fully immune for the rest of your life, but it might not, just like getting the vaccine might not. The difference is that the vaccine is much better at long term protection, and doesn't involve contracting a deadly illness that could kill you first.

I have some basic knowledge of how cutoff values are calculated for tests (i.e. turning the spectrum into a binary) using statistics, but can someone with more knowledge comment? The 2019 value could very clearly be a false positive. The others in Jan 2020?

Using loudspeakers, police officers at the checkpoints on National Road No 1 struggled to prevent them from leaving the city, urging them not to congregate and telling people to remain where they stay as per the Government's order. The law enforcement and local authorities took note of their information and address to provide support later.  
  
One man named Ho√†ng from Ph√∫ Y√™n Province told Vietnam News Agency his family has been unemployed due to the outbreak and lockdown measures but has not received any financial support, while the rent and daily expenses have become too much of a burden. He knows he is not supposed to leave on his own personal vehicle out of the city but he has no option.

[],,EmperorThan,,,[],,,,text,t2_efkqr,False,False,[],"Insurance companies don't really have a reason to cover anything they don't want to cover because they're a company not a government service provided by taxes. This is the reason insurance companies are insidious as a concept for a healthcare system. If the 'company' says it wants to up your rate for a lifestyle choice the onus is on you to find a different company that doesn't do that in a *'pretend free market with endless choices'* where you can shop for a better service. A free market libertarian capitalist would say the free market will create such a company that fits what you want but there's no reason for any company to if they all agree to do the same practice closing out that niche in the market for one to exist. That's also ignoring that most Americans can't afford health insurance that isn't connected to their workplace. So it's very rarely a choice you get to make of what coverage you get if the company doesn't want to pay for it.  
Having said all that if we ever got M4A (which won't happen in my lifetime but should have years ago) this same proposal could also open the door to the government having exceptions for coverage based on your lifestyle habits, which should be fought tooth and nail by the taxpayers all paying into the services. Obese people being required to pay for diabetes amputations, pregnant women being required to pay for pregnancy because it's a choice, cancer treatment not being paying outright if even a single thing in your lifestyle could be connected to the type of cancer you have, etc. This shouldn't be allowed IN THE HYPOTHETICAL, MAGICAL FUTURE where we all have universal healthcare covered by our taxes like a normal nation for the same reason we shouldn't require people to pay fire departments out of pocket for having fireplaces in their home even if they already pay taxes for fire departments. If you pay into the system with your taxes you get the benefit of the government services. Unfortunately, I've found all too often that people rarely see the loopholes in their logic that would hurt themselves in the future in such hypotheticals. I'm firmly pro covid vaccination, I got vaccinated as soon was was literally possible, but I'm also firmly against this idea because insurance companies shouldn't have any more power over us than they currently have and a hypothetical universal healthcare system should limit the government's ability, in the extreme, against punishing people for lifestyle choices.",,,,1629042186,{},h91inez,False,t3_p4tknm,False,True,t3_p4tknm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p4tknm/should_the_unvaccinated_be_required_to_pay_for/h91inez/,1629108252.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,
