That said, this is also a bad narrative. For every Florida, there's an Arizona or Mississippi (0.27%, 0.31%). FL had a very average response, yes, but perhaps DeSantis's policies led to Florida having more deaths than necessary -- but maybe with better leadership they could've been closer to Oregon or Vermont.

No...  For Th cells to be activated, you need to have cells that are already infected (secondary antigen exposure).  That's not protective immunity as the cells need to be infected before you have an immune response kick in.  The lag time between secondary exposure and the antibody response is 3-4 days.  For SARS-CoV-2, viral titers are highest in the pre-symptomatic stages of infection where you have rapid viral seeding through downregulation of type I IFN.  So, by the time the antibody response kicks in, you've already got an infection.  

Not to mention, natural infection (and vaccination) favors Th1 cells over Th2.  Th2 are more associated with humoral responses whereas Th1 are more associated with cellular responses, macrophages in particular.  Macrophage response is exactly what we don't want with SARS-CoV-2 infection.  M1 macrophage polarization in response to intracellular pathogens (i.e. viruses) triggers monocyte-derived macrophages to enter the lungs which leads to macrophage activation syndrome and cytokine storm.  Those that have initial Th2 response to infection (found largely in children...children with MISC have a Th1 response) fair much better with SARS-CoV-2 infection than those with a strong Th1 response.

This is why I've always said that you need antibody titers present from the start to prevent infection and we shouldn't be relying on T cells for SARS-CoV-2 as it's not proven that they will actually be helpful in disease pathogenesis and could, in fact, contribute to more severe disease/reinfection.",,,1617173543,{},gsw2tp6,False,t3_mgtxls,False,True,t1_gsvymuu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mgtxls/t_cells_induced_by_covid19_infection_respond_to/gsw2tp6/,1617173554,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

2. Therefore these doses were given to other groups that would not yet be eligible for vaccination otherwise.  
3. AZ is now considered suitable for older people and thus people under 60 moved back in the queue until the older age groups are done.

not many people in that age group would need to die from adverse effects of the vaccine for it to be ""not worth it"".

PEI safetyreport (Pauk-Ehrlich-Institut Sicherheitsreport) does not say how many of each age group died of the vaccine. they only say the entire age rage, like 24y-87y. as the total age range was adjusted down 2 time from already **at least 2** people under 29 have died so far because of vaccine complication.
  
factor in that young people are hardly getting vaccination and its not hard to see WHY vaccination have beeing stopped/halted. or why AZ is not being given to people sub 55.

* Shutdown fatigue coming as cases are on the rise

**Travel industry trade groups, airlines and other organizations are developing so-called vaccine passports** to make it easier to navigate changing rules. Most are in early stages or only used in certain destinations, though their creators say they are working to expand use. What’s less clear is whether any will emerge as a standard accepted broadly worldwide.

Birth control.

In fact there is also a new type of surgical-kind masks using 5-layers that are also measured as highly effective. Two masks at once will achieve a similar effect. I found these much easier to breathe in comparison with the FFP2 we use at work. I've also used double masks myself in contaminated areas and never got covid. unlike everyone else around here in Europe.  

One of the reasons surgical masks are ineffective is not really the material, but the fact that unlike the N95  or FFP2/3, these masks do not fit perfectly to the face. We tie our surgical ones' elastic strings a little to make them less loose and well fitting to the face. You have to stretch them well and press on the face contour, and adjust a lot to make them fit as they need. Like 95% of the users are unaware of this. I've seen everyone else not doing this tight fitting and adjustment each time, to have large gaps under the edge of the mask, near nose, chin but most often at their cheeks. So basically it's not just the mask but the fact that you are breathing from underneath it. Obviously, air will use the lowest minimal resistance channel to get in and out. So you're exposed.

Two masks at once are much better fitting due to being thicker and the double elastic, and providing sufficient protection due the extra layers but also indeed due to this better fitting to the face.

In Starbucks, or any indoor dining for that matter, you'll have multiple patrons removing their masks at multiple tables. No windows open. Easier for the Covid air to float around to other maskless patrons. 

Hence, a reason why my state, with 50% opening of indoor dining, is starting to see a rise in positive cases. People think it's now ok to eat indoors, because of the lifting of restrictions, on top of mask fatigue.

The point is that everything requires balance, and it's not at all clear to me that we have a balanced, rational, utilitarian perspective on this. In Scotland, the average age of COVID death in men is 83 while the life expectancy is normally 82.5. In Ireland, over 90% of COVID deaths were in people who never entered the ICU -- i.e. the hospital ethicists determined that their co-morbidities were so high that it would be unethical to extend their lives further. Is anyone actually factoring in ""loss of years of life"" instead of just ""deaths"" and comparing these costs to the well-known increased mortality associated with unemployment and psychological stress? If you think that it's *impossible* for the ""medicine"" to cause more harm than the disease, you're simply wrong. 

Meanwhile... the opioid epidemic has killed over 500,000 Americans, yet nobody has shut down the economy to prevent it and hardly any money has been spent to fight it.  In an normal year, the US has about 100,000 deaths from nosocomial infections and Europe has another 100,000 deaths. Yet prevention is simply a matter of demanding more PPE, better equipment sterilization, and better air handling -- all things that we could solve by spending more money. Cars kill 1.35 million people every year, yet nobody seems to suggest shutting down car traffic.  These three examples all kill people much younger than the typical COVID death, so they actually impact more ""loss of years of life,"" yet for some reason we don't spend $6 trillion mitigating them.  

In the 1950s, before the vaccine, polio caused high rates of paralysis and death in children -- our most valuable members of society who have the most years of life to lose. Yet when an outbreak hit a school, the school was only shut down for a week or two and then reopened. People thought that the cost of shutting down education for a semester or a year was too high despite the ravages of this disease. How it is that Americans of the 1950s had such a different calculus compared to Americans of the 2020s? Which one got their balance wrong? 

The Hong Kong flu killed 100,000 Americans in 1968, but there was not the slightest thought to cancel Woodstock, etc. Same with the flu of 1958. No American universities were shut down because of the Spanish flu in 1918 -- they just converted dormitories into expanded sanatoria and got students to volunteer to care for the sick.  Why the difference in attitude? Have be become smarter or dumber? Do we simply value life more now? 

The bottom line is that it is normal and inescapable to tolerate a certain amount of death as simply a part of life. We don't shut down all life in an effort to prevent every possible death. We don't spend *any* amount of money preventing death. We somehow agree on a balance. Faced with widespread media hysteria, how do we know that we have the right balance? Are politicians and policy-makers sitting down with economists, epidemiologists, and psychologists *together* to calculate the right balance? or do they only meet with one or the other separately? or do they simply react to public opinion?

Bottom line, Fully vaccinated persons have contracted covid19, both symptomatic and asymptomatic. If you are infected, you are contagious.

This virus doesn't stop being a virus because you are vaccinated. The vaccine practically eliminates the risk of severe covid or death from covid19 (though there was at least 1 death I am aware of a fully vaccinated person that I am aware of in the Israeli data).

You're scared but you continue to go to work every day and were doing so even before you were vaccinated, I'm guessing.  You rationalized somehow that your going to work is more important than your fear, which is very commendable.

&gt;As of now, if you got ""fully vaccinated"" and either were true, you wouldn't have antibodies after the Summer and you sure as hell aren't going to get a 2nd round of vaccinations before anyone else get's their first.

In fact, some textile masks (certified at 95% BFE) fit me better than most FFP2 masks due to using more elastic materials and may thus actually work better in some situations. Unfortunately, while the materials are tested and certified, it is very difficult to find information that takes the fit into account.

Rules that are not enforced are generally ignored. Even with those that are enforced, people always try to find excuses to appeal fines anyway.

In my region of Spain, we once had a rule enforcing masks outside only in crowded areas where you couldn't keep a safe distance. Result? Most people didn't wear a mask even in the tightest of crowds. It's hard to enforce and you could always say ""but there was enough distance"", ""but I just passed by the crowd for two seconds..."" so people ignored the rule. And also many people went out without masks and wanted to enter shops, because ""hey, I forgot my mask, but it's only one minute, I buy my bread and I leave"".

Then they changed it to masks outside at all times, and most people now follow the rule. People don't forget the mask, and they have it on in crowds because they have it on always. Problem solved.

She's become aggressive, snappy, very emotional and she pees herself daily. At 12 years old. 

Virtual learning is a hassle for her. She can't focus on the class, she's always distracted. We have to stay in the room constantly because she will start browsing the internet or forget to go to class. 

At this point the worst part is that it's difficult to even get her to go outside and do things because once you grow adjusted to this comfort zone, 'normal' things become scary and uncomfortable. Even I am experiencing this and I am a grown ass adult.

The normal route involves a lot more red tape, bureaucracy, paperwork etc. Lots and lots of paperwork! Rest assured the same level of review of the data, safety, and all relevant study findings are reviewed as part of the EUA! There is still much paperwork and review involved, hence why it takes weeks to submit the EUA application and then weeks more for the FDA to review before providing approval.

All that to say the EUA is not something to fear, or think “why is the vaccine not formally FDA approved, why only an EUA?” The EUA is an option reserved for extreme situations and the EUA process is being used right now in exactly the way it was intended.

The NHS has also been working with trusted community leaders, faith groups and volunteers who are well informed about the vaccine and are able to answer questions. This includes in the languages of their communities.

Pop up vaccination clinics are also being set up in places of worship such as mosques, temples and churches to make the vaccine as accessible as possible.

You mentioned penicillin, which opened the door to other antibiotics and common drugs that we don’t even think about but save lives. 

mRNA vaccines and treatment will revolutionize the medical field. They’ve already been used, to some extent, in experimental cancer research. This vaccine could lead to a “cure” for cancer eventually. It could also lead to other vaccines for viruses we never had the resources to research before. 

A lot of medical advances are held back because of a lack of funding. No one is researching the cure for common cold viruses because there isn’t money in that research so there’s no way to find it. However, there is now research into modifying this vaccine tech to fight *all* corona viruses, which can prevent us from another pandemic in the future, as well as fighting some of the viruses responsible for the common cold, SARS, and MERS. That would be incredible!

How does it work? It's essentially a solution of chimpanzee cold viruses that have had their ability to replicate replaced by an ability to create coronavirus spike proteins, which your body then generates an immune response against. The chimpanzee virus is harmless to humans and can't spread - it's used as a way to smuggle the spike protein generation into cells.

Does it work? Yes - depending on the study and interval between doses, it has an efficacy of [62%](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)32661-1/fulltext) (Testing for all COVID infection), [76%](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/azd1222-us-phase-iii-primary-analysis-confirms-safety-and-efficacy.html), or [81%](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(21\)00432-3/fulltext) (Both testing for symptomatic COVID). In all of these studies the vaccine was 100% effective at preventing hospitalistion or death. IRL it won't be 100% but it does suggest it is very effective in that regard.

Is it safe? That's a slightly more complex question. It's safe *enough* that AZ has been able to pull off three separate trials without a death from the rare type of clot it seems to cause, and safe *enough* that the MHRA and EMA seem happy with it. Should mention that it doesn't seem to cause elevated rates of 'blood clots' in general, but [one rarer and more serious type](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/cerebral-venous-sinus-thrombosis) (CSVT). For whatever reason this *seems* to be more common in Norway, Denmark, and Germany than in the UK or India, which are the most major users of the vaccine. I won't speculate as to why this is because I don't have a clue.

 As of yesterday Germany had reported [31 incidences](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSS8N2KO06C) of CSVT among their zeneca'd population, which is either [2.6 million](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-vaccine-doses-by-manufacturer?tab=table) or [3.8 million](https://impfdashboard.de/) (think it's 2.6 mn but not sure). That works out to an incidence rate of somewhere between 1 in 84000 and 1 in 123000. From those 31 cases of CSVT, 9 resulted in deaths, so the odds (in Germany) of getting a CSVT and dying after an AZ vaccine are between 1 in 290000 and 1 in 420000.

I'm wanting to compare that to the risk of other activities for context, but it's quite difficult, since getting the vaccine is a one-time (ok, two-time) event, so it feels statistically shoddy to compare it to the lifetime risks of other events. Anyway:


Event | (Lifetime) chance of being killed by
---|---
Car crash| 1 in 106
Falling down the stairs| 1 in 1657
Drowning in a swimming pool| 1 in 5573
Plane Crash | 1 in 11175
Dog attack | 1 in 118776
Struck by lightning | 1 in 180746
CSVT caused by Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca | 1 in 290000 - 1 in 420000
(Data taken from [here](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-mortality-risk))

The decision rests with you obviously, but I'd take those odds. I'd certainly take the AZ vaccine, although being young and in the UK that probably won't happen until June or July.

When you're fully vaccinated, you're 90+% less likely to become infected with covid in the first place.  Once you have covid, it's looking like you're then 95% less likely to transmit it to anyone else.  

I'm just thinking about this logically.  In many areas of the country, it's already pretty unlikely for you to encounter a case of covid (the areas of the country doing medium or decent are sitting around only about 10-15 new cases per 100k per day).  So any given person you run into is like a thousand-to-one chance of currently having covid. Then if you do unluckily encounter one, you have to be around that case for long enough that you would catch it; you obviously don't catch covid every single time you encounter a case.  Then if you're fully vaccinated, there's a 90% chance you're not gonna catch it.  So you have to run into a bunch of thousand-to-one odds to be infected in the first place.  Then once you ARE infected, the vaccine cuts your odds of transmission by 95%.  And lots of other people are also already vaccinated, and basically can't catch it from you.  And then if somehow all of these events occur and you manage to infect someone, there's obviously still a huge chance they're asymptomatic and unharmed anyway, same as it's been the whole time.

At some point it just no longer makes sense to continue restricting your life for these infinitesimal odds of actually hurting somebody.  As someone who lives in a state that's currently well under 10 cases per 100k per day and will be fully immunized in about 3 weeks' time, I'm going to start behaving a lot more normally.  I've followed all the restrictions religiously since last March.  I'm wearing a mask everywhere today even when not required.

You've caught me at a bad and drunken hour. I'll do my best. I actually made an error in my previous statement.

If after some time 200 unvaccinated people are infected and only 20 vaccinated people are infected, the efficacy of the the vaccine is (200-20)/200=0.9=90%. Now notice that ten times as many unvaccinated people were infected, that means that a vaccinated person is (10-1)*100%=900% less likely to be infected.

	Too many U-turns

Frustration at the inconsistencies in policies is growing. Germans are baffled at why some of them can take holidays in the Balearic island of Mallorca over Easter while those stuck at home aren’t allowed to visit local camping sites or holiday cottages in their own backyard.

Paradoxes and zigzags such as these are fuelling widespread indignation. One doctor, Carola Holzner, from the western city of Essen, even invented a word to describe the public mood — mütend, a cross between müde (tired) and wütend (furious).

“No to masks, then yes,” she wrote on her Facebook page. “No to rapid tests, then it can’t happen fast enough. Schools opened, then closed, then opened again. First there’s not enough PPE, then not enough vaccines. No one can stand all this political vacillation any more.”

	The list of U-turns is indeed striking. A plan to roll out free antibody tests by March 1 was scrapped because it turned out to be impossible to implement in time. Authorities initially declared the AstraZeneca jab unfit for use on people over 65, then okayed it for everyone. The AZ shot was withdrawn completely over fears it could cause blood clots: four days later it was reinstated after the European Medicines Agency insisted it was safe. Then on Tuesday authorities decided it should only be given to the over-60s.

“People aren’t corona-deniers, but they just don’t understand this constant shilly-shallying,” says Dirk Neubauer, mayor of the small town of Augustusburg in eastern Germany. The federal and regional governments were constantly blaming each other for policy failures, “but ordinary people don’t care who’s at fault — they just want the system to work”.

Part of the anger can be ascribed to shutdown fatigue: shops, restaurants, theatres and gyms have been closed since November, and the rapid spread of the highly infectious B.1.1.7 variant first discovered in the UK has stymied hopes that the restrictions might soon be lifted. Jens Spahn, health minister, warned last week that if the situation doesn’t improve, Germany’s health system might reach “breaking point” next month as intensive care units fill up with Covid-19 patients.

	‘The next fix’

Meanwhile vaccinations are progressing too slowly to offer much of a silver lining. Germans are incredulous that so few have received a jab more than three months after a vaccine developed by a German start-up, BioNTech, became the first in the world to receive approval.

“A German company invented the vaccine, was given €375m in German government funding and we’re the last ones to get it,” says Bockhahn, the official in Rostock.

He describes the anxious wait for supplies of the BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines, all of which have proven erratic and subject to delays. “We’re like junkies desperate for our next fix,” he says.

Germans mostly blame the EU for the shortage of doses: the European Commission stands accused of ordering too little vaccine, too late. But they also fail to understand why the authorities in Germany have been so slow to administer the doses they have. Only around 262,000 people received a jab on Monday, according to the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s main public health authority — down from a peak of 306,000 on March 12.

Some critics say authorities have been far too strict about who is eligible for a shot. “It’s a German phenomenon — this idea that people shouldn’t be vaccinated if it’s not their turn,” says Ulrich Weigeldt, head of the German Association of General Practitioners. “The message should be that the more people get the jab, the better it is for society.”

	Merkel herself has said authorities needed to show more flexibility. “Maybe we’re a bit too perfectionist sometimes,” she said in her Sunday TV interview. “We want to do everything right because whoever makes a mistake gets a real beating.”

But it’s not just a matter of excessive caution. Inoculations slow to a snail’s pace on Sundays — perhaps unsurprising for a country that still takes the day of rest so seriously but still extraordinary considering the gravity of the pandemic. What’s more, a number of states have announced they will close their vaccine centres over the Easter break.

The inoculation campaign has exposed a system of government that is slow and, at times, overly bureaucratic. That is particularly the case with appointments for jabs: booking websites routinely crash and hotlines are badly understaffed. “It took me five days of calling to get a slot,” says Erika Olias, an 85-year-old Rostock resident who finally got her first dose last week.

The inoculation process itself also involves a great deal of red tape. Take the mobile vaccination teams who administered jabs to care home residents up and down the country at the start of the year. “There was a pharmacist to fill the syringes, a nurse to administer the shots, a doctor to explain the procedure to patients and three Red Cross employees to do all the paperwork,” says Neubauer, who witnessed the process at an old people’s home in Augustusburg. “It just leaves you speechless.”

He said the attending doctor had to fill in, stamp and sign eight A4 sheets of forms for each patient. But a second team who came to give the second dose a few weeks later had to go home because they’d brought the wrong forms, he says.

All of the data could have been digitised. “But we’re just obsessed with paper,” he says. “And it slows us down massively.”",,,1617190837,{},gswl390,False,t3_mh2pvh,False,True,t3_mh2pvh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mh2pvh/we_are_a_laughing_stock_covid19_and_germanys/gswl390/,1617190847,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

So our actual probability is: what is the chance the OP dies given they have COVID?  We go to our sample of 20-39 year olds who have had COVID.  

None of this data is perfect, and there are a tonne of other factors to consider (like the known long term effects of a COVID infection and the risk your infection poses to others etc.), but at the end of the day their combined risks from a COVID infection are higher than a blood clot which we're not even certain can be attributed to the Astrazeneca vaccine.

[],,dancingn1nja,,,[],,,,text,t2_16kvnvkc,False,False,[],"The 'natural' incidence of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is approximately 1 in 66000  people per year.  Let's say these events have  occurred over a timespan of two to three months.  If we multiply the frequency by five, to give us expected incidence per year, then we can hypothesize that there is an increase in the risk, however in absolute terms the relative risk (when compared to the benefit of getting vaccinated) is still very low. 

Why do I say that?  This last year, 160 people per 100,000 in the USA have died as a result of merely existing, unvaccinated.   In the UK the number is higher (190), in Italy 180, just to take three countries.

The incidence of CVST would give approximately 7 or 8 cases for every 100,000 people who are vaccinated.  Meanwhile, you would be saving 152 (USA) / 182 (UK) / 172 (Italy) lives for every 100,000 people vaccinated in those countries.

Do you let 152 / 182 / 172 people die just to prevent 7 or 8 cases of CVST?

Of course, in an ideal world, vaccines would have no side effects, however in the real world, not only is that never completely true, but there is also a risk from not having immune protection.  Also, yes there are alternative vaccines, but between not vaccinating versus using the AstraZeneca vaccine you are clearly going to save (about 20 times) more lives by vaccinating than by not.

It's a tough subject to discuss and it's not enough just to bombard people with data (tempting though it is).  More open communication between pharmaceutical companies, health systems and the public on risk benefit profiles (e.g. what does safe mean?  Are you actually 'safe' if you don't get vaccinated?) and how these are worked out are the only thing that are going to build people's trust in measures like vaccination programs in the long term

Saying cases are trending downward does not match what statistics are showing.  

One of the variables we encounter is the variants and mutations.  According to reports from Brazil, where the P.1 variant originated and is predominant, more people typically not associated with higher risk (age and previous conditions) are getting very sick. This variant is shown to be more infectious and to escape immunity thanks to the E484K mutation. It also seems to be more fatal, but maybe thats just the condition of Brazil's healthcare system.  

Do I think we will see the graphs trend upwards again?  Perhaps it will. I think another wave before herd immunity is achieved is possible. I also think its possible we will require several boosters to the current vaccines to keep the virus under control. Lastly, I think its possible the vaccines will fail to make a meaningful affect if the virus mutates faster than we can create and disperse vaccines.  We may just be chasing our tails.  

With all these *possible* outcomes, I think its foolish to disregard CDC warnings. They have access to information, knowledge and experience that you or I do not likely have.

Anyways, I’m sorry for your loss. I’m wearing a mask where it’s required.

If the reasoning bothers you...it shouldn’t, because the point is that I’ll be wearing a mask.

[],,backpackwayne,,,[],,,,text,t2_3ci9p,False,True,[],"The Biden Administration has set up federally supported community centers and mobile clinics for delivering shots.

As of Feb. 3, there are 130 federally sites operational across the country. FEMA has deployed 449 staff to provide personnel and technical assistance and additional staff are supporting virtually. As the number of states with obligations increases, FEMA is working alongside other federal agencies to provide federal support for critical staffing, supplies and other shortfalls that can help get more Americans vaccinated.

The federal government  partnered with state governments to launch  community vaccination centers using primarily federal staff to support state and local governments. FEMA provides resources, operational support and federal staffing support to establish these new centers.  

Federal Funding to Accelerate Vaccine Efforts
As of Feb. 3, FEMA has provided more than $1.76 billion to states, territories and tribes for expenses related to COVID-19 vaccination at 100% federal cost share.

These funds cover emergency protective measures to include:

Supplies and commodities needed to safely store and administer the vaccine.

Transportation support and reasonable, necessary security for refrigerated trucks and support for leasing space to store and/or administer vaccines, including utilities, maintenance and security.
Medical and support staff, including onsite infection control measures, personal protective equipment for staff, cloth face coverings for patients, temperature scanners, physical barriers and disinfection of the facility in accordance with CDC guidance.
Dissemination of public information and communication regarding vaccinations.

FEMA is supporting COVID-19 vaccine distribution by providing reimbursement to governments for costs associated with vaccine distribution and administration. Providing funding to states, tribes and territories is an Administration priority. After a request is submitted, reviewed and validated, FEMA can expedite reimbursement for eligible emergency work projects to ensure resources are available to support vaccine distribution and administration.

The costs of purchasing the vaccine and support kits are not covered by these obligations and do not duplicate any HHS funding.

Federal Coordination to Identify and Fill Resource Gaps
FEMA is working closely with state, local, tribal and territorial governments to fill gaps that local health officials have identified. Additionally, emergency managers are working closely with appropriate health officials.

FEMA released “FEMA COVID-19 Vaccination Planning FAQ,” a document to help assist governments with their vaccine distribution efforts and reimbursements for associated costs. FEMA will work with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other federal agencies to ensure a coordinated approach to using Defense Production Act authorities wherever necessary so private sector companies can increase vaccine supply and spur vaccine manufacturing.

**Vaccine Guidance**

FEMA is working with the Ad Council to encourage hesitant or underrepresented Americans to get vaccinated. This research-driven public education campaign provides federal, non-profit, and medical stakeholders with insights and communications strategies to tailor communications to reach diverse audiences. The vaccine is not a perfect fix. Everyone should continue to practice other precautions like wearing a mask, maintaining physical distance, handwashing and other hygiene measures until public health officials say otherwise.

They are tracking it just like they are tracking aby side effect that occurs in the population and seems at least plausible. The difference between the placebo and the vaccine group was not statistically significant. They measured this in the trial up to one month after the 2nd dose and have continued to look at it. By now, millions have been vaccinated. If there was an increased risk of something so obvious, it would have come up by now. Out of 15k people for each vaccine there were 4 cases in Pfizer and 0 in placebo and 3 in Moderna and 1 in their placebo. Neither of these rates are higher than the confidence interval of events expected in such a large population. You haven't heard about any followup because there was nothing to followup on. There's one case of it occurring since but this person had 3 previous episodes before the vaccine. 

&gt;In the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine trials, Bell’s Palsy was reported by 4 vaccine participants. From Dose 1 through 1 month after Dose 2, there were 3 reports of Bell’s Palsy in the vaccine group and none in the placebo group. This observed frequency of reported event is consistent with the expected background rate in the general population, which suggests that a causal relationship to the vaccine cannot be made (Pfizer-BioechD-19, 2020). In the Moderna trials, 3 vaccine recipients and 1 placebo recipient reported this MAAE.

&gt; Brazil detects new coronavirus variant similar to South African

&gt; By Eduardo Simões
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Brazil has detected a new COVID-19 variant in Sao Paulo state that is similar to the one first seen in South Africa, the head of the state’s Butantan biomedical institute said on Wednesday.
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking at a press conference the day after Brazil suffered a record 3,780 deaths in a day, Butantan President Dimas Covas said the patient with the variant had no history of travel to South Africa.
&gt; 
&gt; The South African variant has alarmed public health experts as there are questions over how effective current vaccines are against it. Brazil is also grappling with its own homegrown variant, called P1, which appears to be fueling a record-breaking run of infections.
&gt; 
&gt; “It is a variant similar to that of South Africa, although there is no history of travel or contact with travelers from South Africa,” Covas said. “There is a possibility that it is an evolution of our P1 towards this mutation in South Africa.”",,,1617222237,{},gsycxoc,False,t3_mhafzh,False,True,t1_gsxzsmv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mhafzh/brazil_records_3668_deaths_in_24_hours_and_breaks/gsycxoc/,1617226035,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Historically, the pandemics last about 1-2 years before they disappeared into the background, remaining endemic to the population.

Back in May/June last year when a short immediate lockdown would probably have been the best thing to do in Melbourne, the political belief was that such steps were either not necessairy or not publicly popular.

Melbourne's subsequent long level 4 lockdown over 4 months now informs how all Australian decision makers think about COVID outbreaks. They're making decisions with the fear that if they don't do a short, sharp lockdown, and contract tracing cannot control the outbreak, then they'll be punished by public opinion.

The political cost of a lockdown for 3-5 days is easy to price in, particularly when they're highly effective. So decision makers choose the quantifable risk, versus the unknown risk of letting contract tracing do its thing, when there's no real reward for doing that.

I'd also add this, Victoria didn't lockdown in December when the NSW outbreak spread to Melbourne at a Thai resteraunt. But then subsequently did when they had the potential spread at the Airport and private gathering in 2021. Perhaps the actual context of the outbreak does change the response and we're being unfair on those making these decisions.

I'd lastly add, that it's easy in hindsight to criticise the decisions being made. It all looks so clear after the fact when we know how things played out.

Last March we had contact with someone who, two days after we met up with them had a positive diagnosis.

Some time later, my partner and daughter lost their sense of taste and smell. Other members of the house had flu like symptoms, but mildly.

There was absolutely zero chance of any of us avoiding an infection from one of the others. The house is small and distancing is impossible. 

Virus testing was, at the time, unavailable, so no proof except evidence of symptoms, but the proof seems pretty incontrovertible to me and anyone else we've told.

Now here's the bit that might seem like this is a joke post. 

I definitely caught it, right? There's no way I couldn't have been infected. If they had covid, I had covid, but my only possible symptom was...

Ecstacy.

For a couple of days when the rest of the house was at the height of their suffering with recognised symptoms of covid, I felt bloody terrific. Better, mentally and emotionally, then I had in months, even years.

Can anyone else relate? Have there been any reports in confirmed asymptomatic infections of people actually feeling BETTER while definitely infected with covid?

&gt; Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D), battling a surge of coronavirus infections in her state, appealed on Tuesday to White House officials to shift away from a strict population-based formula for vaccine allocation and instead rush more doses to hard-hit parts of the country.

&gt;“I know that some national public health experts have suggested this as an effective mitigation tool,” she said during the White House coronavirus response team’s weekly call with governors, according to a recording of the conversation obtained by The Washington Post. “And I know we’d certainly welcome this approach in our state.”

&gt;The inquiry reflects growing unease among state officials on the front lines of what health experts say could be a new wave of the virus already afflicting parts of Europe. And it illustrates the pressure President Biden is under, even from members of his own party, to show he is taking steps to address disquieting trends after a prolonged period of declining infections.

&gt;The accelerating pace of inoculations has not been sufficient to fend off case increases as more transmissible variants circulate in the United States, especially among young people who have fallen sick in outbreaks tied to schools. As of Monday, Michigan’s seven-day average of new daily cases stood at 5,157, a 58 percent increase from a week ago and the steepest increase nationwide, according to Washington Post data. The state, where restrictions were recently relaxed, also reported the largest growth in coronavirus hospitalizations, which rose by more than 47 percent.

&gt;But Jeff Zients, the White House’s coronavirus coordinator, told Whitmer the Biden administration is not inclined to change its formula for allocating vaccines. Currently, the federal government sends all three authorized vaccines to states and other jurisdictions based on the size of their populations, while setting aside separate portions for retail pharmacies, federally run mass vaccination sites and community health centers.

&gt;“We have to make sure that everything is thought through and on the table,” Zients said, advising Whitmer to work with experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure the increasing supply of shots is used most effectively to protect vulnerable populations.

&gt;Zients said a record weekly allocation to states of more than 21 million doses would provide governors with additional tools to curtail the virus. He also echoed President Biden’s call for state and local leaders to reinstate mask mandates and pause their reopening plans.

&gt;All told, the federal government is expected to deliver about 33 million doses this week. Much of the increase comes from a significant boost of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-shot vaccine, the supply of which is being split evenly between states and pharmacies, Zients told governors.

&gt;A spokesman for Whitmer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

&gt;The formula for vaccine allocation was inherited from the Trump administration, though Biden’s team has significantly expanded the number of retail pharmacies where shots are available and has also deployed federal personnel to stand up about two dozen mass vaccination sites. Biden promised another 12 in remarks on Monday. These sites are chosen because they serve residents disproportionately burdened by the pandemic, officials say.

&gt;As manufacturing continues to ramp up, some experts have suggested further changes to how vaccine is distributed.

&gt;Citing outbreaks in particular states such as Michigan, Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said over the weekend the Biden administration should “surge vaccine into those parts of the country.”

&gt;With “the incremental vaccine that’s coming onto the market, I think the Biden administration can allocate to parts of the country that look hot right now,” he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

&gt;By diverting some of the expanded supply to hot spots, the government could avoid cutting any current allocations to states, he told The Post on Tuesday.

&gt;Arnold Monto, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan and the chairman of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, said the government may also need to adjust its formula to reflect waning demand for the shots in some parts of the country while others face continued scarcity. 

&gt;“I’m not sure what the solution is, but clearly there are some problems with distribution,” he said.

&gt;Data released this week by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services show hundreds of students and staff have been infected at schools throughout the state — with the most significant outbreak occurring among 36 students at Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste. Marie in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.

&gt;Earlier this month, Whitmer loosened capacity limits for restaurants and other businesses, and eased restrictions on both indoor and outdoor gatherings. Joneigh Khaldun, the state’s chief medical executive, told reporters last week there was no single metric officials were using to decide whether to reimpose restrictions, and the Whitmer spokesman did not respond to a question about whether the governor would heed the president’s call to halt reopenings.

&gt;“We continue to look at the numbers,” Khaldun said.",,,1617142071,{},gsum9af,True,t3_mgr7sc,False,True,t3_mgr7sc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mgr7sc/michigans_whitmer_asks_white_house_to_surge/gsum9af/,1617146856,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I would disagree and say it is the upside for several reasons.

The first is that you don't have all your eggs in one basket.

The second is that local people are experts on their locality. They know things like road closures, weather patterns, hospital systems, local pharmacists and doctors, etc.

The third is that different states have different needs. 

The fourth is that bottom up almost always beats top down.

This is a great piece highlighting how a state level strategy beat the federal plan:

According to the Ministry of Construction’s figures, national housing stands at 3,824,861 homes, 39% of which are in an average or poor condition. Late last year, the deficit stood at 929,695 homes, a figure which clearly increased after the tornado that hit Havana in January.""

Speaking to CBS’s Face The Nation on Sunday, Dr Fauci said that ""children can clearly wind up getting infected"", if they play with other kids despite their parents being vaccinated.

He added that ""when the children go out into the community, you want them to continue to wear masks when they're interacting with groups from multiple households"".""

This is what the first part of the article say... 

No where in the article did Fauci mentioned that kids should not play together until they are vaccinated. Furthermore, he stated that you should be cautious and have your children keep a mask on when you're out and about with different community groups.

In the article it linked to CBS Face the Nation. Go watch that if you haven't.. he said that in the video at 4:16 that children can still get Coronavirus, when interacting with groups of multiple households.

Well, precisely.

For an example of how that looks in a more theoretically ""open"" country, like the USA, look no further than the early days of the pandemic in Washington State, where the local health authorities and the CDC were slow &amp; reluctant to declare apparent community spread of the virus.

Literally no country wants to get labeled infected and suddenly unable to travel to other nations.  At least until they're certain as to both the severity and the communicability of the disease.

The nation-state level incentives just don't align at all with ensuring global isolation of a disease.

But 39000 deaths in a year out of 2.8m recorded is about 1.4% of deaths, so it doesn't seem too unexpected (not quite sure how they calculated their 1 in 106 odds, I calculated it up to 1 in 72, mebbe I missed something) - cars are dangerous, but societally we find that risk acceptable for their utility.

The question is whether we find tolerable the risk of a vaccine that is about 2700 times less likely to kill you.

Some background:

I got my 1st vaccine shot (Pfizer) in late Feb and 2 weeks or so after I could have sworn the outside of my lips tasted slightly metallic like they would be if they were chapped. Then it went away after a day or so. Second shot was a week and a half ago and a few days ago, basically the inside of my mouth tastes very metallic.

I don't have other symptoms that Dr. Google would say would indicate that I have liver or kidney disease and my gums are not red or bleeding, however I've seen search results come back for people who have been recently vaccinated or have had Covid having metallic taste.

The only other thing to add is that I did have a pretty upset stomach between the first and second dose that lasted about a week. (The type where you get a really bad cramp the first day, and then the next several it's like a gnawing sensation) - It went away with time and probiotics/yogurt and bland foods but now I am wondering if the taste is a result of me somehow catching Covid shortly after my first dose (and that the stomach issues were because of Covid), or maybe I possibly have/had GERD which also apparently can cause metallic taste. I'm on my second week of taking Prilosec but the metallic taste is still kind of hanging around.

It's frustrating that there could be so many reasons but again this started after my recent vaccine. I took a rapid test yesterday and it came back negative. I suppose I could get an antigen test next to see if I am recovering from an actual Covid infection. So many damn variables at play that it causes me anxiety. Guess what else causes a metallic taste in your mouth? Anxiety. Sigh. At this point I also sometimes wonder if it is psychosomatic and I'm simply focusing on it too much.

So again, if anyone else has had vaccine-related metallic taste in their mouth, I'd love to compare your experience for peace of mind.

Probably the cleanest way to verify if death numbers are being fudged is to look at total excess deaths - year over year vs. COVID deaths as you can't (easily) hide dead bodies, even if they aren't accurately classified.

The NY Times has solid data on this topic in another article at: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/14/us/covid-19-death-toll.html

From it Florida shows 35,000 excess deaths vs. 30,000 reported COVID-19 deaths. This is roughly in line with national data (556k vs. 484k), so I'm not sure there is as much death hiding as in other states (ahem - Kentucky, Oklahoma, California, and WV - all showing at least 30-50% fewer COVID deaths than total increased year over year deaths).",,,1617158032,{},gsvg3um,False,t3_mgufwd,False,True,t3_mgufwd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mgufwd/report_florida_may_have_undercounted_its_covid19/gsvg3um/,1617161620,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Small variations means fast detection, and quick suppression of the virus. The virus might not even get past the mucus membrane in your nose. The only symptom might be a few sneezes.

This is why nasal swabs with PCR is such an inappropriate procedure for finding infected COVID cases. People who previously had a coronavirus cold (there are many) would never get COVID symptoms (ie, clinical illness), but they count as cases and the data can be used to raise the fear level in the population. They say never let a good crisis go to waste, and if you have equipment with a control knob where you can amplify the crisis, so much the better.

Ask yourself these questions:

* Where did all the PCR equipment come from. Which industry was so willing to donate it.
* Why did the statistics change from COVID deaths to COVID cases. Who loses potential customers with every person who gets infected and becomes immune naturally
* for which industry would global herd immunity be an absolute market disaster. They would have almost zero customers
* who has vast experience in advertising in the news media. Is it unusual for the news media to be endlessly repeating the same news story over and over. Normally, the news loses interest in any story in one week and shifts over to the next shiny object. Does one year of repetition look more like normal news or like heavy paid-for marketing

Yes, tons more paperwork will follow for each of the studies in the under-18 groups...! It will be just as thorough as the review of the trials that approved the vaccines for adults.

To answer your larger question about the blood clots and what goes into the approval process. Beyond the standard paperwork, yes, the data does get reviewed. That is the heart of the approval process. The FDA will have a panel of experts reviewing everything together. They will review the raw data, lab reports, participant’s (anonymized) medical history to determine relevance of any adverse events, regulatory compliance documentation - every little thing in a study gets recorded and filed in a big digital “binder” all the way down to brand and shipping documentation of vials used to collect blood at the study sites. Tens of thousands of pages of documents, maybe even hundreds of thousands of pages. A ton of excruciating detail the general public will never see, but the FDA will.

The FDA experts panel will include actual medical doctors, data managers and data analysts, statistics experts, regulatory (i.e. ethics committee) experts, clinical management experts, and on and on. They will review every last bit of data or paperwork collected during the course of the study. They will review what (for example) Pfizer has said their claims are on the efficacy, but they won’t take Pfizer’s word for it.

Stop it. Stop making excuses for this. Being fat is a poor life choice in the vast majority of all people. Even those with eating disorders need to seek out help to solve those, and not doing so is a poor life choice.

But also don't pretend most people are fat due to eating disorders. Most people are fat because they don't put down the fork. You can call me callous all you want for saying it, but we all know its true. 

And I personally know this to be true because I was a whale. 365 pounds. And it was **100% my fault and absolutely no one else**. I ate to much, and I ate terrible things. It was all on me, and then I fixed it.

I understand how hard it is to make the changes needed. Because I've been there and done it. But making excuses is the easiest way to continue to be fat for the rest of your life. Even if it is an ""eating disorder"", it is *still* on you to fix it and nobody else.

For a landscaper there isn't as much risk or need to have the vaccination as the guy trimming your bushes isn't face-to-face with high-risk individuals 600 times a day.

I agree the government should NOT be giving out incentives...although predicating the covid relief on vaccination status may have been an interesting approach. Maybe you get your $1000 right away, and the extra $400 after showing proof of vaccination? We incentivize lots of activity already by tax refunds/credits.

Social distancing, mask wearing, etc. make people less likely to spread the virus. And so do vaccines -- if 80% of people can't catch it from you, you're going to infect fewer people. Since the measles vaccine is 95+% effective, the R0 of measles in a vaccinated population is less than 1, even though an immunologically naïve population would have a 15.

In our population -- where many people get flu shots, and many people have had flu before, and everyone has been exposed to some variants of flu virus -- the flu normally has an R0 slightly above 1 during the winter, and below 1 during the summer. So 0.53 is lower than flu typically is! But on the other hand, in 2020, when many people were wearing masks &amp; taking precautions against Covid-19, flu's R0 was extremely low. We don't know exactly what it was, but 2020 essentially didn't have a flu season. The same mitigations that took Covid's R0 from 3 down to a little over 1 took flu from a little over 1 to basically nothing.

The important value, though, is 1. If R0 is 1, a disease's frequency in the population will stay constant. If it's below 1, it declines, above 1, it increases. The further from 1 you are, the faster that decline or rise is. 0.53 is great because it's a lot lower than 1, and will result in the infection rate dropping substantially every week.",,,1617145787,{},gsutfu9,False,t3_mgbhvt,False,False,t1_gst3c87,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mgbhvt/israel_356_new_cases_09_positivity_rate_while_the/gsutfu9/,1617150457,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Total speculation, but my guess is that vaccine mandates will be allowed to exempt those who got working vaccines that haven't received FDA approval, otherwise that's kind of a mess. Practically speaking, all the vaccines with EUA are almost definitely going to get approved, but they will probably be approved at different times which means there will be some people who got vaccinated with vaccines under EUA vaccines that are not yet approved when mandates start being allowed, and I have to imagine nobody will want a mandate that doesn't allow their kid in school because they received say Moderna instead of Pfizer and Moderna is a few months away from being approved. That would be silly.

More uncertainty in my mind - what about people who were vaccinated in other countries with vaccines like Sinovac or Sputnik V that won't even receive EUA in the US much less approval? If/when COVID vaccine mandates become a thing, will they be required to get an *American* vaccine before joining the military or starting school or whatever, or is being vaccinated with *some* vaccine enough?

It is confident of receiving approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in time to start Curevac vaccinations in two months, said company CEO Franz-Werner Haas. It is difficult to give an exact date, he said, because there must be a certain number of people with the disease in the so-called Phase 3 trial involving 35,000 subjects before it can be evaluated. The Curevac vaccine is the second vaccine from German production after Biontech. Like Biontech, it is based on so-called mRNA technology. Curevac had contractually agreed to supply the EU with a total of 225 million vaccine doses. This year, the company plans to produce 300 million vaccine doses.

Your parenthetical is likely offpoint.  FDR didn't have any Supreme Court appointments until 1937.  By the time Korematsu was decided (1944), FDR had appointed 8 of the 9 Justices.

Now, I don't really know if those Justices were more pro-FDR - a number of them (Frankfurter and Black in particular) were absolute titans of the Bench and could hardly be accused of being as overtly political as many of the modern Justices we've seen - but I wouldn't consider the fact that the early FDR Court struck down some of his policies as evidence that the later Justices he appointed weren't aligned with him.

And it's not like Korematsu was a 9-0 opinion either.

Transmission requires infection. This study is huge because it actually looked for asymptomatic carriers of the virus by PCR and did not find them in the vaccinated group.

In order to be able to transmit the virus it needs to be replicating to high enough levels in your upper respiratory tract to be able to be spread through aerosols or droplets that you excrete. This cannot happen if the virus isn't actually there. The PCR test is a direct test of viral RNA, if there's no virus it cannot be spread.  This data strongly suggests that the antibody response generated by the vaccine is enough to stop the virus before it takes hold and replicates in the respiratory tract, just like what happens with most of our vaccines.

As far as I know, none of the major chains have issued any statement on when they'll lift mask mandates, which gives me the impression that they're waiting for the recommendation of the CDC. Unfortunately, the CDC isn't talking about that either.

It's a leadership gap. The government can't or won't tell people what to expect, so people have to come up with their own rules since the politicians in charge of the response won't treat the situation with nuance or understanding. These leaders then act shocked when the states make their own decisions after the federal government refused to share information or give realistic expectations. I consider it a complete political failure.

I haven't been able to find one statement from Biden, Fauci, or the CDC about what will need to happen for them to advise the mask mandates end.

If we are careful in reopening and resuming activities, based on current projections, I believe we could likely see a return to more fully open movie and Broadway theaters sometime in the fall. This is no guarantee.

I'm becoming a little frustrated with his attitude that reopenings with masks and social distancing are actually ""reopenings."" Movie theaters, zoos, sporting events, and other big crowd circumstances like that are already open with these precautions. I think by this point he should be aware that the question is when things are open in a normal way, and he always- *always*- dodges that question.

It's not hard to understand why so many people are coming under the impression that Fauci doesn't want things to return to normal. He avoids talking about it every time he's asked. I get it, he's not a politician, he's a doctor. But if they're going to put him in front of cameras every single day and ask him questions about public policy, he really should learn how to talk in terms that keep humans in mind.

Most people aren't planning on dedicating their lives to eradicating this virus. Him not understanding that leads to people ignoring any public health guidelines.

A lot of the points you mentioned about locality are specific instances in that area, and this is of course important, but we live in the information age, and there is no real need for separately controlled strict guidelines (or otherwise) that can be contradictory and make people's lives more difficult. The idea of road closures, weather patterns, and hospital systems or healthcare locations are things that anyone can find out at any time by nature of a simple search on the internet.

To the point at hand, this article plainly states that the key to WV's success is how it has a small population that is tightly knit. This is not the case in more populous areas where a genuine plan and execution needs to be in place, because when you have millions of people wanting to get a vaccine at the same time, it causes what myself and others in this thread are dealing with right now. Because of how some states are leading due to inherent factors that are not based on their location (mainly based on factors that have accumulated over time, as the same can be said for North Dakota which is cited in that NBC article as well) and others lag is proof that something is not working and needs to be fixed.  

I think what I am saying is that our system does not demonstrate anything very positive about it when someone in one state has to scrounge and stress to get vaccinated against a deadly disease, meanwhile someone else has absolutely no problems at all and is able to do so with ease (to the point where the vaccine is delivered to you in your own home). If anything, this is the exact problem I have and I am confused as to how this scarcity due to a lack of planning and unified execution makes this a good thing.

Your article is great for West Virignia and North Dakota, but again there are 1.7 million, and 762,000 people living in those states respectively. In New York state there are 19 million, and in another place like Florida there are 21 million which makes vaccine rollout on a local level much more difficult and this is where we see the system start to break down because there are simply too many people that need to be tended to for a local government or legislature to really handle effectively without outside help. 

I understand that this case-by-case approach can work, and I am very happy for the people living in North Dakota and West Virginia for being in a safer position now. With that said there is also a lot of evidence to show how this approach is not working out so well when it comes to handling large amounts of people efficiently.

I do appreciate the idea, and I am all for it in certain instances, but at this point in my life I don't know how useful it has been for dealing with more than 5 million people very efficiently.

Yes, that's true. That's not the reason I brought up that article. I brought it up because that article makes the point that they are not yet able to conclude how their findings translate to clinical settings something you seem to be ignoring. 

&gt;The vaccine was 85% effective against severe disease cases no matter the infectious variant, and all the deaths and hospitalizations in the trial occurred among people who got the placebo, not the vaccine.

This is a good result but still, even in that article it is tempered after with the line: 
&gt;Experts also raised the question of whether the vaccines might lose more of their power against the variant faster than they would against other SARS-2 iterations. How long the protection elicited by any of the existing vaccines lasts, against any version of the virus, remains an open question. Essentially, researchers have to track vaccinated people and watch when their immunity wanes. But a weaker response could start to dissipate faster.

&gt;Andersen said the Novavax and J&amp;J results should serve as a rallying cry for the global scientific community — including vaccine makers and regulators — to prepare, in case the B.1.351 variant or some other form of SARS-2 is able to “escape” immune protection in ways the trial data do not yet show. He said people shouldn’t assume that because the vaccines appeared to guard against severe disease from B.1.351 during the trial, that people will carry that protection for a long period.

Again it seems to be still in the air how things will shake out with the new variants, though we have good reason to believe our vaccines should offer protection against severe disease we don't know to what extent which is the point that I make and I think the articles I've linked tend to make. You're very keen on ignoring that. 

&gt;We have pretty clear data from clinical trials, as well as real world scenarios with countries like Israel to support the claim that vaccines prevent hospitalization and death from all current variants of covid.

Data from Israel probably gives us a good indication that the vaccine protects against severe disease from B.1.1.7 but I'm not sure how much it tells us about other variants as far as I'm aware of. From what I'm reading it seems B.1.1.7 was the dominant variant. If you have something about what it tells us about other variants can you link me that? 

I don't understand why you can't just back off the claim and say something like, ""we have a pretty good idea that our vaccines should offer us protection against severe disease. With newer variants, it's still in the air though we have some promising results. It seems too early to be able to tell exactly how results will translate to larger clinical settings."" Instead of taking on the stance ""the current variants will not have a major impact in USA"".

Because all the scientific evidence points to maximum efficacy of 95% after the 2nd dose. It doesn't get any higher than that in any study or at any other endpoint for any vaccine.  None. Period.

After Dose 1, on the other hand?  Could be as low as 29%, per one study. Or 46%, per another. Or 52% per another.  Could be 80%

So while you may be happy to take that risk for yourself, why are you taking that risk for other people forced to be around you?

&gt;people have a risk tolerance

Yes, exactly. And when it comes to a virus that is transmissible as easily as Sars-CoV-2, your personal risk tolerance affects OTHER people.

Let's say I get my first dose.  I decide that I, personally, am now OK with taking a risk that I won't get sick if I start not wearing a mask. 

And maybe my bet pays off - FOR ME.  I never feel so much as a scratchy throat. But that doesn't mean that I didn't just infect the server waiting on me, who is also waiting to get their shot, though.  Or the bus driver on my daily commute.  Or my coworkers.

The way I look at it is this: 2 weeks post 2nd Dose, pretty much EVERY study shows that you are at the least risk to yourself and those around you.  After Dose 1?

I mean, yes I agree completely, vaccines are super protective and thankfully we don't *need* to suppress or eliminate community spread of COVID to protect vulnerable people thanks to that. But the question being asked was about whether we will reach herd immunity, not about whether deaths and hospitalizations will become untied from case counts because the most vulnerable people will be vaccinated even as COVID continues to have community spread. The comment I responded to was initially getting downvoted for accurately answering that herd immunity by summer was mathematically unlikely, although it seems rational people swung by and now it has been heavily upvoted, so consensus swung in the right direction.

&gt;Variants will always spread

Maybe! I think this is still an open question that will only be answered in time. I haven't *completely* given up on the possibility that if enough people get vaccinated and we keep tuning vaccines for the most common variants that show up that we could eventually end up finding some way to mostly suppress community spread of COVID the same way we did for other viruses like mumps - I think this kind of depends on exactly how quickly new vaccine-evading variants emerge and (relatedly) how long vaccine immunity lasts, which we don't really know the answers to yet.

Oh just ""be rich"", why didn't I think of that! 

&gt;The airlines are literally giving people what they want.

No, they are not. They found the absolute tiniest sliver between ""this isn't worth it"" and ""I can deal with this coffin for a few hours"". 

&gt;Airlines that have offered premium legroom and seat width throughout the whole cabin historically always go bankrupt because most people buy flights based on price.

Where did I say ""premium""? Why are you making absurd assumptions about what I want? I didn't say every seat should like first class and completely lay flat. 

I said it's steerage. Because it is. The seats are too narrow. There is not enough leg room. I am 5'5"", WELL below average height for a male, and I get cramped. God fucking help me if a tall person sits next to me and literally can not fit their legs straight forward. 

&gt;If you want change you should contact your representatives in Washington to mandate minimum seat pitch and width.

I have. 

&gt;Would level the playing field for all airlines but would also drive up the cost of flights.

Oh no!!!! We'd have to pay 1/30th more per ticket!!!

That's how the math works out. Remove one row and give everyone a full extra inch of legroom. 

If airlines gave a shit about being efficient they'd give everyone one free checked bag charge $50 per overhead carryon. They'd also board back-to-front, window-to-aisle. 

They don't. They only care about charging for every possible thing they can. They intentionally separate parties to punish them for not paying the extra fee for the LUXURY of choosing where to sit.

This is when we really need to start admitting that the cure has become worse than the disease. Masks and social distancing for children for much longer is an abomination. When is enough going to be enough? I don't see mask requirements indoors (at least on the federal and private sector level) being lifted until well into 2022. My child is 3 and hopefully will not have to deal with fucking masks and distancing themselves from children when she goes into kindergarten in 2023, but I am not getting my hopes up.  


Sorry, someone has to say it - I'm so over protecting the vulnerable. We gave them a year of our lives. We wore the masks, saw no family, did nothing. Kept a child indoors for over 365 days. WHo is protecting us now? Certainly not the CDC. The mental health crisis will be the next pandemic, it already is becoming that.

## Abstract

Virus-virus interactions influence the epidemiology of respiratory infections. However, the impact of viruses causing upper respiratory infections on SARS-CoV-2 replication and transmission is currently unknown. Human rhinoviruses cause the common cold and are the most prevalent respiratory viruses of humans. Interactions between rhinoviruses and co-circulating respiratory viruses have been shown to shape virus epidemiology at the individual host and population level. Here, we examined the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in the human respiratory epithelium in the presence or absence of rhinovirus. We show that human rhinovirus triggers an interferon response that blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication. Mathematical simulations show that this virus-virus interaction is likely to have a population-wide effect as an increasing prevalence of rhinovirus will reduce the number of new COVID-19 cases.

It's a annoying that the New Zealand response and most of Australia's response is seen as the best way for western nations when there is a much better response.

You must sign in using the state government app at all restaurants, pubs, hair dressers, basically anywhere you are going to spend more than 15 minutes.

## Abstract

The emergence of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants stresses the continued need for next-generation vaccines that confer broad protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We developed and evaluated an adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 Spike Ferritin Nanoparticle (SpFN) vaccine in nonhuman primates (NHPs). High-dose (50 *µ*g) SpFN vaccine, given twice within a 28 day interval, induced a Th1-biased CD4 T cell helper response and a peak neutralizing antibody geometric mean titer of 52,773 against wild-type virus, with activity against SARS-CoV-1 and minimal decrement against variants of concern. Vaccinated animals mounted an anamnestic response upon high-dose SARS-CoV-2 respiratory challenge that translated into rapid elimination of replicating virus in their upper and lower airways and lung parenchyma. SpFN’s potent and broad immunogenicity profile and resulting efficacy in NHPs supports its utility as a candidate platform for SARS-like betacoronaviruses.

**One-Sentence Summary** A SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein ferritin nanoparticle vaccine, co-formulated with a liposomal adjuvant, elicits broad neutralizing antibody responses that exceed those observed for other major vaccines and rapidly protects against respiratory infection and disease in the upper and lower airways and lung tissue of nonhuman primates.",,,1617202931,{},gsx6efq,True,t3_mh7zxv,False,True,t3_mh7zxv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mh7zxv/efficacy_of_a_broadly_neutralizing_sarscov2/gsx6efq/,1617203222,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It's pretty obvious that for the lowest risk, you'd want to be in 'Group A'.

That's why the headlines only mentioned being obese, even though the study included those classified as overweight, but not obese.

I'm not sure how that differs from the flu. Never seen direct comparisons but I'm guessing this would be a piece of the puzzle compared to how flu ends up leading to death in young children.

Here is the abstract of a paper on it.

&gt;Novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is emerged in Wuhan, and recently become worldwide pandemic. Strangely, ample evidences have been shown that the severity of COVID-19 infections varies widely from children (asymptomatic), adults (mild infection), as well as elderly adults (deadly critical). It has proven that COVID-19 infection in some elderly critical adults leads to a cytokine storm, which is characterized by severe systemic elevation of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Then, a cytokine storm can induce edematous, ARDS, pneumonia, as well as multiple organ failure in aged patients. It is far from clear till now why cytokine storm induces in only COVID-19 elderly patients, and not in young patients. However, it seems that aging is associated with mild elevated levels of local and systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines, which is characterized by “inflamm-aging”. It is highly likely that “inflamm-aging” is correlated to increased risk of a cytokine storm in some critical elderly patients with COVID-19 infection.

Does the paper work include data audits or criteria for approval? Or is it more just actual loads of paper work? Would concerns such as that be something that would be addressed in the approval process? 

I can imagine, or i’d hope, that any concerns like that would be caught somewhere along the line in the approval process.

Vaccination was initially a success (high number of doses very fast) so the government decided to relax the lockdown measures. Keep in mind that this was during our summer, so they even allowed people to travel between cities for vacation which was previously discouraged/banned. 

Then summer holidays ended and classes began, with the government encouraging schools to open (kinder to high school. Universities are autonomous and most/all decided to start the semester online). The government speech on this whole time was remarking the success of the vaccination campaign and the need to open the schools because of children’s mental health.

Another layer to the problem is that Chile is a very centralized country, with about 50 percent of the country’s population residing in Santiago, the Capital. For the holidays, Santiago residents spread the virus to the people in the regiones. So while the cases were surging in the regions, the capital numbers were decreasing, but the government always put more emphasis in the results of the capital, even when the regions where experiencing numbers of cases never seen before. As you can tell, I do not live in the capital 😂 so I have very strong opinions about this. To give you an example of centralization: my region only has one Urgent care bed (?) available, and this counts the pediatric beds that were converted to adults’ ones one weeks ago, but today the minister of health gave a speech about converting pediatric beds if there is the need to do so, which is the reality the hospitals in the regions are living.

So the TL;DR is that the government started a very good vaccination campaign (which still is very good), but they fell victim to triumphalism and centralization and spread the virus to the rest of the country from the capital in the context of relaxed lockdown measures for the summer holidays plus the start of the school year.",,,1617151587,{},gsv4dgi,False,t3_mgf046,False,False,t1_gsv2jhw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mgf046/daily_discussion_thread_march_30_2021/gsv4dgi/,1617155885,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This sub has gone downhill. Calling interim data ""literally fake news""?  This is what people write on Alex Jones forums, but isn't factually correct.   As the following quote highlights 

&gt; ""The NIAID statement does not accuse the company of trying to deceive anyone, Fauci stresses""

Both numbers were in line with each other.  Neither data release at any point included any ""literal fake"" data.  *The efficacy of AZ in older age people actually improved from 80-85% in the updated figure*. There was no statistically wild deviation.

&gt; would you prefer a company be allowed to publish old data that they know is no longer true?

Yes. If that is what the company was bound to do based on their trial protocol based on set number of events.  interim data  by its nature is outdated and designed to be superseded by more accurate data once more events come in. Interim data is not a concrete measure of efficacy nor used to gauge success, nor used by regulators independently to approve the vaccine 

&gt;they issued a press release on that data when they also had the final data available.

They didn't yet have the final data available. The primary efficacy endpoint required more events  than they had yet accrued at interim announcement and analysed. The company has to have independent statistians conduct the analysis after those cases have been accrued. The issue was that DSMB had seen some subset data which led *them* to beleive the efficacy at primary would be significantly  lower.

 As it turns out DSMB/Fauci statements about much lower efficacy and 69% etc were incorrect, whereas AZ statements about the primary announcement being in line with interim were correct. It turned out to be at best much ado about nothing and at worse fear mongering. This data was never going to be hidden. 

Releasing interim data first is exactly what multiple other manafacturers did, and as more events accrued that number was updated, the same will happen with AZ

Here is a better explanation of what occured from reputable media

&gt;The White House communication team learned about the DSMB note and contacted Fauci. “We say: Wait a minute, we have a company that already has got some checkered stuff going on from Europe, that comes out with a press release, and in good faith, the federal government copies their press release,"" he says. “And then you have the DSMB that writes a note, which absolutely is going to get leaked, that is a very harsh criticism. So, if we just keep quiet and let things play out, people will say: You're covering up something that is not right. And if there's one thing that the government does not want to ever do, is to cover up something that's not quite kosher. So, we had a meeting late into the night and said: We’ve got to clear the air.”

Basically white house encouraged NIAD to turn this non-public background critique public because of fears it would get leaked and then they would be roped in the AZ drama that was occuring in Europe and that would harm image of US regulatory process and transparency 

&gt; Jha and other public health experts say the small downgrade in reported efficacy has little meaning. Such data come with wide confidence intervals; the new analysis indicates the true efficacy likely lies somewhere between 68% and 82%.",,,1617194306,{},gswq1kp,False,t3_mh3i1g,False,True,t1_gswn5dr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mh3i1g/pfizer_says_its_covid_vaccine_is_100_percent/gswq1kp/,1617194319,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This thing is spreading out of control because half of the country is unmasked, doing whatever they want, and/or would be asymptomatic or have a long incubation period when they get it. 

If you want to stop the spread in its tracks and you have a limited supply, continue to let the elderly and pre-existing people quarantine, and make sure that you get the shot in the arms of the younger people who still have to go to work and face customers and would likely continue to spread it asymptomatically when they get it.

But that's not the whole picture.

First, COVID reinfections happen, and will likely increase in the near future as more variants emerge.  You aren't necessarily trading one COVID illness for two vaccine side effect sessions.  You might be trading two or three COVIDs.

Second, the risk of death is zero for the vaccine and non-zero for COVID, even for the young and healthy.  As an individual, my top priority is preventing my own death, and I am happy to trade off significant side effects for that, even if the risk of death otherwise is very small.  I don't want to spin the wheel of fortune with a ""you die of suffocation"" slot on it at all, no matter how big the wheel is.  I'm happy to alternatively spin the wheel of fortune with no death slots even though half of the slots say ""feel worse than COVID for a day"".  Yes, I know we take risks every day.  It's not strictly rational, but that's people for you.

The 1st link doesn't say anything about not carrying the virus, actually it says quite the opposite:  


&gt;One of this study’s strengths is its design: participants self-collected nasal swabs each week for RT-PCR laboratory testing, regardless of whether they had developed symptoms of illness.  Researchers were able to look for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection irrespective of symptoms. **A small number (10.7 percent) of infections in this study were asymptomatic (i.e., did not result in symptoms). However, the majority of infections (58 percent) occurred among people whose infections were identified by testing before they developed symptoms or knew they were infected.** The study demonstrates that these two mRNA vaccines can **reduce the risk** of all SARS-CoV-2 infections, not just symptomatic infections.   
&gt;  
&gt;This is important because **preventing both asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections among health care workers and other essential workers through vaccination can help prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2** to those they care for or serve. Findings from this study complement earlier reports that these two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines can **reduce** both asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. 

Reduce the risk and reduce the number of infections does not mean not carry the virus or spread it. Simply means the risk to the host (the person) is reduced. Yes, it does help protect you and helps prevent up to a 90% chance of being infected with the virus, but it doesn't say it stops you from being able to spread it.

The side effects we have to worry about are short-term which is why we have that 15 minute waiting period. That is the time at which you have the highest chance of something dangerous happening (most likely an allergic reaction). After that, the chances decline sharply and whatever side effects you do have are short term and bearable, like muscle aches or a temporary fever.

And so to make sure we know all about the possible side effects the best thing we can do is get as many people in the trial as possible to monitor what side effects they have while we monitor thousands of people at the same time. The chances of something happening *frequently enough to be a concern* after the trial that we didn’t see inside the trial are astronomically low - just like what happened with the AstraZeneca blood clot issue. It may not have happened in the trial, but the cases of it happening in general population were so low it can’t be attributed to the vaccine really.

Let’s take Bells Palsy for example. There were some reports of people developing Bells Palsy after getting their vaccine. Well, after reviewing those cases it was determined the number of times this happened was equal to or less than the number of times any random person walking down the street would suddenly develop this condition. In other words, if those folks hadn’t gotten the vaccine, they would have developed Bells Palsy anyway, speaking statistically.

There’s a lot of talk in the media whenever “new” side effects pop up, or even when an elderly person dies after being vaccinated. Think of it this way.... we are vaccinating most of the population all at the same time. In normal life, people have medical events or die. If we give everyone a vaccine within the same window of time, people will continue to have medical events and die. So long as these medical events and deaths aren’t occurring more often after getting the vaccine than they would be occurring in “natural life” (ie if they had not been vaccinated) this is not a concern.",,,1617213793,{},gsxuhzk,False,t3_mh3i1g,False,True,t1_gsxfjvs,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mh3i1g/pfizer_says_its_covid_vaccine_is_100_percent/gsxuhzk/,1617216042,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I’m not sure why you are trying to make this Germany vs. the US and UK...but if you want to, here’s what people are worried about:

The cumulative case rate per 100,000 (all cases):

US very slightly better. Why? Probably vaccines.

Case rate, last 7 days:

GER: 147

The gap is widening more, probably almost all due to vaccines.

Now you roll out a vaccine that will kill some fraction of those people.

What is going on here is that you are exposing to danger a particular subgroup of the population who are not at risk from the virus, in order to protect people who are at risk.

For the extreme edge cases like, say, Norway, you might end up killing more people in those groups by vaccines than by the virus. This is a problem.

If you are saying that *the side effects of vaccination are on average worse than the symptoms and risks for young people actually catching COVID*, I don't think this is even close to accurate. Like for example, my friend in his mid-twenties caught COVID and was coughing up a lung and felt like shit for a week and then recovered, and I don't know *anyone* who had vaccine side effects that were worse than having a fever and malaise for a couple days, and I'll take the latter any day. That doesn't even count the really severe tail risk that even if *extremely* unlikely, you could absolutely get hospitalized or die from COVID no matter what your age is. Like yeah it's only a very small percentage of young people who get hospitalized because of COVID, but the number of people who got life-threatening vaccine side effects has been a small handful out of tens of millions - basically a rounding error.

I am particularly concerned with anaphylactic allergic reactions due to my medical history, and there were news reports of people having anaphylaxis after getting the shot on the first few days of the public getting them under the EUA. This was concerning to me. About a month later, however, the CDC released some data of allergic reactions in the first week of administering the [Pfizer](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7002e1.htm) shot.

1 in 100 000 is pretty infrequent to me, and reasonable precautions have been taken to ensure vaccine sites have emergency medicine personnel have access to epinephrine and training to diagnose and treat anaphylaxis.

[],,TMKF2,,,[],,,,text,t2_1llpscw9,False,False,[],"Short answer for the U.S.: No.

First There's a LOT of misinformation about the way COVID deaths are reported and calculated.For example, insurers and payers don't automatically pay providers more for patients diagnosed with COVID. Their care plan costs are approved to be higher but the hospitals and clinics that are treating those patients actually have to deliver those services in order to bill for them, and fraudulent billing has been and continues to be illegal. I also assure you that the insurers have every intention of NOT paying for fraudulent services and diagnosis and have programs, and IA and specialists that do nothing all day but sniff it out. Cause of death being documented as COVID also poses no significant financial advantage to hospitals or insurers (with the exception of very minor subsidies that are often offset by increased cost of care).

Second, in the U.S. cause of death vs contribution or complication is largely based on perception of mortality risk prior to being diagnosed. If that person had early congestive heart failure, but a great 5 year prognosis prior to a COVID diagnosis and their heart condition was markedly reduced in the period where they were most symptomatic, and they died within that 28 days of heart attack, it is medically probable that COVID caused their death. The standard for causality is framed in terms of likelihood or probability that is based upon a rational review of pre-diagnosis condition and post-diagnosis condition.

More Likely than Not -  There is a notably greater likelihood than 50%. For legal purposes this means definitively causal.

At Least as Likely as Not - It's equally or more likely. I.e. at or slightly greater than 50%. This too is generally treated as causal.

Not Likely Due To - It is less likely to have been causal than it is to have not been causal.

Not Due to - It is definitively not related.

For a point of comparison lets use an unusually common cause of death: Drowning. If a person has an epileptic seizure while swimming alone, what is the cause of death? No-one is going to debate that epilepsy was the cause of death, because it is ""more likely than not"" that under no other circumstances would that episode have resulted in the death of the individual. Drowning was the cause of death.

Let's go back to the early congestive heart patient. Pre-diagnosis, their outlook was good: metabolic testing was good, blood pressure was being managed, and they started an exercise program. Then they got hit with COVID and were bedridden for ten days, or worse hospitalized. During their convalescence they started experiencing arrhythmias and diminished peripheral circulation and died. No reasonable physician, coroner or medical examiner would indicate that congestive heart failure was the cause of death when in that case it is ""more likely than not"" that the patient would continue to maintain or improve their condition had they not suffered the disease and its symptoms.

Third, in the U.S. Flu deaths are calculated and reported in the same way in terms of causality and contribution, and including a period of post diagnosis during which deaths would be considered to be caused by influenza.

At what point does isolating a growing, developing child from social interaction with other growing and developing children, nonetheless family members, become cruelty? Reading through the comments on that thread is really depressing and I really feel for those children who are being completely sheltered and trapped from the outside world.  

I've seen comments about how people are trying to now introduce interaction with other children and how their child just clams up and starts shouting at the other child or crying if someone gets too close to them.  How will a child interact when they are placed in an environment like a classroom? Is home schooling and furthering that isolation longer and longer going to be the answer? I've also read a comment about a preteen on antidepressants because of the past year of isolating. Just so saddening and heartbreaking.  

At what point is the cure worse than the disease?

A lot of that population is now vaccinated, and the ability to be vaccinated is widely available.  We've dedicated an entire year of our lives to them.

MI hospitalizations are truly exponential now, which is no surprise. Deaths are trending upwards and we should see signs of acceleration in the next week if delayed hospitalization conversion ratios hold. Given that vaccines prevent severe illness there is no reason to think they won't convert otherwise the hospital rate would be much lower.

A wave is likely, though not assured.

Wear a mask and distance as much as possible. If you can get a vaccine do it, and don't worry about taking someone else's shot.

1976: The swine flu vaccine caused Guillain-Barré Syndrome in a small number of people.  GBS has an incubation period of 10-14 days after vaccination.

1998: A rotavirus vaccine caused bowel obstruction in infants, which is an immediate medical emergency.  I'm not entirely sure how long it took for the bowel to obstruct, but they were still infants when it did.

2009: An H1N1 vaccine caused narcolepsy in a few hundred people, happening one to two months after vaccination.  This is by far the most serious incident in recent history.

That's really it.  (The CDC page lists incidents that didn't actually hurt anyone.)  So I believe the answer is definitively no, unless 1-2 months is long enough to qualify as long term.
