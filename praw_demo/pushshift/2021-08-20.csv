Vaccination breakthroughs almost never in healthy people

In a study published in a specialist magazine in July, experts evaluated data from 152 patients from 17 Israeli hospitals who were infected with Covid-19 despite having been fully vaccinated. Only six of the 152 people were previously healthy, the rest had previous illnesses, such as a weakened immune system, which can affect the effectiveness of the vaccines ( read more here ). The mean age of those affected was 71 years.


And


""So there were practically no major breakthroughs in Delta infections in people without significant previous illnesses in Israel,"" writes Morris.

There was a case I heard about many years ago where a woman in a factory had her hair caught in a machine and it ripped her scalp off. She was rushed to the hospital right away, of course, and her quick-thinking coworkers put her scalp on ice and sent it with her. Because it was preserved, the surgeon was able to reattach it. But it's not possible to reconnect all of the small blood vessels and nerves, so they basically just connected the major blood vessels and let everything else heal naturally.

And that worked, but the nerves regrew differently from how they were before, so as a result, the sensations on her head were all messed up. If she touched the front, she'd feel it in the back, etc.

So maybe it's something like that. The nerves carrying olfactory signals to your brain are trained to route those signals a certain way, but if they die and then regrow, they connect up in a different way and those signals get mixed up.",,,,1629564697,{},h9t1y4y,False,t3_p8msvv,False,True,t1_h9s4e65,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p8msvv/covid_longhauler_down_to_80_pounds_says/h9t1y4y/,1629629128.0,28,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then take whatever precautions you need until you can get a booster. I said what I said because people like you often act like getting Long COVID is a zero-sum game. The reality is that vaccinated people are not dealing with long COVID at any remarkable rate and if they were, we would have noticed by now. Even Israel, which tracks breakthrough cases very precisely, is not seeing any alarming amounts of long COVID in the vaccinated. A great defense against long COVID is being vaccinated and the best defense is being vaccinated in a highly vaccinated community.

He got AZ. I (mid-30s) got my first shot the day the walk-ins opened up to everyone two months ago and there was no question that they were giving me the Pfizer because of the risk to my age group.

So in summary I'd say that the UK being mostly Astra Zeneca is kind of a misconception now, they still give it out as a default but at this point almost everyone has something that could get them the Pfizer if they prefer it.

The whole reason nurses are able to travel to different hospitals for work is bc they all run very similarly. They might have different software programs for the computers, but hospitals generally all run the same. Some hospitals are nicer and more well-funded than others, but they are still the same.

To aid in having a more immediate response in the future, should you encounter that same virus/ bacteria. However over time your body won’t have as many of these memory cells if any at all. The big problem with Covid is it’s a virus and viruses mutate. Now if everyone got vaccinated when it’s available and we were still dealing with an alpha strain then chances are you nip it in the bud. But instead you have large pockets of people not vaccinating which allows for the variants Delta and Lambda to become the dominant strain. So unless people pull their heads out of their ass and get the vaccine when available and until everything is under control continue to mask the virus will continue to mutate. Either the virus will continue to spread until everyone that can be infected is infected or we break the chain of survival for it. There really isn’t a third option. And if you are of the mindset of well just let it keep going, you are banking that a new strain further down the line isn’t even more deadly.

In summary we have an unbelievably small difference in calculation based on slightly different figures. My mistake was to assume the dataset I used had every death, instead of reading the fine print. The full data set, however, says it includes some unconfirmed deaths too.

&gt; Now it’s like, we never said it prevented you from getting it.

There's not a vaccine in the world that will 100% prevent you from getting sick or passing it on.  Not a single one.  Instead, every vaccine always has some chance of preventing you from getting sick and some chance of being ineffective.

So what happened to polio, smallpox, and measles?  Herd immunity keeps them at bay.

Your chance of getting sick with a disease is tied both to the likelihood that you'll be exposed, and the effectiveness of the vaccine you took.  The likelihood of exposure, in turn, is linked to how widespread a disease is.  And how widespread a disease is depends on how many people each infected person infects, commonly called Rt.

If Rt is greater than 1, you'll get more infected people over time.   If it's less than 1, you'll get fewer.  The big effect that widespread vaccination has is decreasing Rt.  That's because many of the people each infected person comes into contact with will be protected by the vaccine,  even though some won't. 



&gt; I’m genuinely curious why I’d need to be vaccinated now if it doesn’t prevent/stop the spread and if I was pretty much asymptomatic. 

Natural immunity with covid seems to provide only so-so protection. 

You and all your friends getting vaccinated won't *stop* the spread dead in its tracks,  but it will *slow* the spread.  And if it's slowed enough,  covid will slowly but steadily disappear like polio and measles did.",,,,1629581740,{},h9u34jz,False,t3_p8r8eq,False,False,t1_h9tvu1n,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p8r8eq/mississippi_poison_control_calls_rise_as/h9u34jz/,1629649092.0,27,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Viruses thrive by exploiting the cells they infect, but in order to replicate and infect other cells they must produce viral proteins. As a result, viruses are also susceptible to exploitation by defective versions of themselves that do not produce such proteins. A defective viral genome with deletions in protein-coding genes could still replicate in cells coinfected with full-length viruses. Such a defective genome could even replicate faster due to its shorter size, interfering with the replication of the virus. We have created a synthetic defective interfering version of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the Covid-19 pandemic, assembling parts of the viral genome that do not code for any functional protein but enable the genome to be replicated and packaged. This synthetic defective genome replicates three times faster than SARS-CoV-2 in coinfected cells, and interferes with it, reducing the viral load of infected cells by half in 24 hours. The synthetic genome is transmitted as efficiently as the full-length genome, suggesting the location of the putative packaging signal of SARS-CoV-2. A version of such a synthetic construct could be used as a self-promoting antiviral therapy: by enabling replication of the synthetic genome, the virus would promote its own demise.",,,,1629556134,{},h9sj64t,True,t3_p8seln,False,False,t3_p8seln,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p8seln/a_synthetic_defective_interfering_sarscov2_peerj/h9sj64t/,1629619965.0,13,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now when Sydney's outbreak has broken the previous record and is approaching a thousand reported infections a day, AZ is available to pretty much anyone who wants it.

Since we didn't really have a proper second wave since March 2020 people weren't really in a hurry to get vaccinated which didn't help either.

This will absolutely not end anytime soon. Here's the math.

The R value of the first strain of covid was 2.3. this means every 1 person who got it gave it to 2.3 other people. An R value below 1 means a virus dies out; above 1 means it spreads.

This is why the vaccine target was 70%. Getting to 70 left only 30% of the population vulnerable, and the R value of 2.3 multiplied by 30% is below 1. The virus dies out.

But the Delta variant has an R value of 5.

This means a vaccine rate of 70% only yields an effective R value of 1.5 for delta (5 x 30% vulnerable population). The virus spreads.

**With Delta, we have to get to above 80% vaccination in order to get the R value below 1.** Do you think we stand any chance of doing that in this political climate?

Back when Pandemic had lockdowns, idiots hung out at Walmart just to get out. So whatever the cure, there are millions of idiots who will not follow the directions properly.

By adulthood you've consumed many things that have been substantially less tested than that.  Not many things have been administered to over a billion people aside from McDonalds hamburgers.

Seriously.  That's an insane number.  There's not that many products that even manufacture 2B units in their entire run.  Much less for 2B people.

So just by being out in the field, we know it's exceedingly well tested.  More so than anything you're doctor will prescribe, certainly more tested and more rigorous standards than anything else you consume.

[],,helembad,,,[],,,,text,t2_s0xb5,False,False,,"&gt;Since last summer I'm pretty sure as a percentage of the overall population, the Chinese have had fewer restrictions than Americans.

I wouldn't think so. Life in the US has been almost back to 2019 since March or so, and even before restrictions were very relaxed and most states have nearly no mandates at all. In places like Texas or Florida, which are pretty relevant demographic wise, businesses have been operating at near full capacity since last September. 

&gt;For the remainder of the year China's tourism industry was at decent levels. 

So was America's. Tourism in Europe has also been recovering steadily since April - most destinations in the Alps and the mediterranean are suffering from overbooking and the highways and planes are crowded as ever.

And the problem within China is not just about active outbreaks. It's also that they're scared of traveling both because the persisting draconian policies have convinced most of them that covid is much more serious than it actually is (the average Chinese in China is pretty much convinced covid has a near 100% death rate - they're still heavily traumatized by Wuhan) and because they never know whether their plans will be completely destroyed by a new outbreak coming in the way.

More generally, the current policies in China create a lot of uncertainty and difficulty. At any time, whenever one single case pops up, transport can be cut off, ports can be shut down, flights can be halted, and it's extremely difficult to get in or out and do business. Not only is this a terrible climate for investing, it's also becoming extremely hard for China to get the foreign workforce it desperately needs - that workforce would rather go somewhere else where not only immigration is easier but it's also easier to get by without having to conform to these draconian policies.

Now, this is not about what the Chinese population is willing to accept. They are willing to accept many things. Even before covid they put up with a near totalitarian regime that would be unacceptable for most Westerners. So this is an unrelated issue.

My husband &amp; I are in our early to mid 40s, no real health issues to speak of, normal weight and fully vaxxed. Our 2nd shots were late Feb to early March, which is my only concern. 

I work in up close &amp; personal ""essential"" communications retail. Like, spend an hour plus with most customers, ""what do you mean I have a password"", indoor environment in Louisiana kinda retail. I have been super cautious. I have skipped large events (weddings, parties, showers) etc pre-vax. I do grocery pick-up. No one enters my home besides me &amp; husband. My Dad &amp; MIL are both back on full lockdown. 

I'm safer on the ship than I am at work or out in my community. Period. They are running 100% vaxxed crew (most 2nd shots completed within last 2-3mos) and 95% passengers vaxxed with the 5% exemptions almost exclusively going to under 12yrs old. Every single passenger must submit a negative test to board. The ones that do receive exemptions must bring a negative PCR to the port, test negative in the terminal, a test mid week and a test to debark. Masks required indoors when not actively eating or drinking.

On flights, all you need is a mask. No vaxx required. No test required (domestic.) It's not nearly as safe. Same at my work. Mask required only. And over the course of the pandemic I have had 2 customer tell me they we covid positive at the end of our transaction after sitting across from me for an hour plus. 

I understand the risk. I'm not in a high risk group and willing to accept that risk to gain some normalcy back in my life. My mental health is important here too. Travel is my thing. This will be my 14th cruise. This risks I take going to work every day far exceed my risk on a ship.

The % fully vaccinated in the 60+ group is ~90% in Israel. So 90% of the population accounts for only half of the serious cases. This is further bolstered by the serious case rate being 9x higher among unvaccinated vs vaccinated 60+.

[],,ieatanxietyforlunch,,,[],,,,text,t2_bdltzbu5,False,False,[],"my calculation was shown, you can see the numerator is the total deaths in japan and the denominator is the population of japan, the percent is the answer.

since you delineated it by over and under 70 you came up with two percentages, all i'm asking for is the denominator and numerator for those two numbers so i can add them up and  come up with something close to the numbers i got off google (rounded of course for ease of quick math, though it's easy enough to be exact once i have exact numbers to work with).

what i'm failing to understand is why you won't just translate a few words of japanese, which you must clearly read well to gather such exact calculations from it, so that the rest of us can better understand it.

now as far as the logic of what i said, since you won't give me exact numbers. here's a simple explanation :  you said ""deaths of under 70s in Japan totals 1.22 thousandths of 1 percent since the pandemic began. There are 251 serious cases currently in this age group. Over 70s deaths are under 1/100 of 1%""

which means the under 70s are 0.00122% and the over 70s are under 0.01%, correct? the aggregate rounded total is what i said ""15,000 deaths out of 125 million people in total, that's 0.012%"" you wanted to be more accurate, so that's cool, try this : 15,592 and a population of 126.3 million for a percent of 0.012345209817893905% is that exact enough?

when you're working with two groups and one is 0.01% (you won't tell me how far under so i can't get more exact, but the lower it is the worse it is for your math skills) and the other is 0.00122% and your overall is 0.012345209817893905% then your population sizes must be 600 people in the 0.00122% group for every 1 person in the 0.01% group (which you can calculate yourself if you want or use wolfram alpha or [https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/math/weighted-average-calculator.html](https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/math/weighted-average-calculator.html) whatever you prefer)

so again i ask, could you tell me the actual number of under 70 deaths, over 70 deaths, and the two population sizes so that i can do my own math? you're a power of ten off on one of those percentages, but until you share your actual numbers none of us can figure which one and decide how important it is. 

you obviously don't have to reply since you're proud, but jesus moving a decimal in calculations like this is really easy to mess up, just admit it, fix it and your argument becomes much better.",,,,1629541498,{},h9rvqpj,False,t3_p89q18,False,True,t1_h9ru7c8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p89q18/japans_covid19_numbers_continue_to_spike_as_the/h9rvqpj/,1629608390.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,ShortFuse,,,[],,,,text,t2_31k9q,False,True,[],"&gt;There have been some issues with myocarditis as well, so that could delay EUA into October I’d imagine.

To clarify, there aren't issues. The concern is over exaggerated. The problem is that myocarditis is already extremely rare. It was expected, out of 436,000 doses that 8 would show myocarditis. It was 16. But when taking the entire 2.8 million doses, only 23 showed it, which was well between the expected range of 2 to 53.

The reality is myocarditis is so rare it's hard to get an exact number. Sample sizes have rarely been so large. Also, a vaccine triggers a somewhat strong immune response that it can expose myocarditis rather than actually be the cause of it. In fact, those who had COVID before getting the vaccine were more likely to show myocarditis meaning it's more likely that the COVID causes it in the first place.

I understand that conditions change as I made some effort to explain but it appears that it has been a month at least when the information being sent out was that break throughs were ""rare"" and didn't lead to serious illness when there were reports that were counter to this. During that period many people might have modified their behavior by wearing masks and engaging in more cautious behavior. I know that all of my fully vaxxed friends modified their behavior and probably would have done so sooner. I am perhaps overly cautious so I decided to modify my behavior when I started reading inconsistent reports of break throughs including people hospitalized or having serious bouts.

I have read (from sympathetic sources) that part of the issue is that they don't want to create a situation which feeds that lies that vaccines don't work. They do work of course.

[],,lucillekrunklehorn,,,[],,,,text,t2_wrdnl,False,False,,"I can give you one answer. My anti vax family member keeps complaining that hospitals need to come up with better treatments. ‘Isn't it strange that all the people with lasting effects were those hospitalized…’ she muses. Hmmm. Never seems to be a possibility to her it could be the severity of illness necessitating they go to a hospital that causes the lasting damage. No, it must surely be the treatments that saved their lives causing the damage. 

She texted - 
“Why aren't we focusing more on treatments and wide spread knowledge of what works the best and fastest to get people out of hospitals as quickly as possible with least effects as possible and raise that 96% survivable rate even further...but insurance companies make more money from booster vaccines than cures...”

The best and fastest thing to get people out of hospitals…oh you mean like something that might prevent them ever having to go there in the first place? Something free and low risk and backed by exponentially burgeoning data showing it’s safety and efficacy after being provided to billions of people across the globe? Something like….a vaccine? 

She is determined to pull her child out of preschool if masks are mandated there, because masks are such a risk to developing lungs, because it will surely be better for his development to be home without the preschool stimulation and education than to wear a breathable cloth a few hours per day. 

She won’t wear masks except where required, won’t get the vaccine, and is annoyed a child tested positive in her kids Sunday school class last week. ‘Why didn’t the parents keep their sick child home!’ She fumed. What do you think ASYMPTOMATIC means?? And you’re going to church in a southern state with a bunch of people who are entirely fixated on how it’s their personal choice snd why is everyone pressuring and victimizing them for not getting the vaccine when it’s a personal choice. You really think one of those parents is going to keep their sick child home if they did know? It’s their personal choice to bring them around your child after all. 

So I don’t know what they really expect. I would understand more if they would mask up and take the standard precautions if they still have concerns about the vaccine. But they refuse to do either. It has affected my relationships with antivax family more than I ever thought possible. I have spent hours trying to convince them and finally largely gave up. They are immovable. They seriously do not seem to understand this is a collective problem, that has to be solved collectively. They seem only able to think along very individualistic lines of how these things affect them personally. The idea of getting vaccinated so the virus has less bodies to find and mutate in is entirely lost on them. “But most people get it and are fine.” YES. And hopefully you’ll be one of them. But it’s about the people who won’t be fine. “Kids don’t get seriously sick, so my kids don’t need to wear masks.” Kids can get seriously sick and it might be your kid. It’s someone’s kid. And it’s about who the kids bring it home to. 

I could go on all day and have. It is impossible to make them understand the public health aspects of this. Not that I’m an expert, but unlike them I feel like it’s at least worth considering what people who have put years of their lives into studying public health have to say.

The short answer, the actual mechanism that triggers long lasting immunity isn't fully understood...understandably there are several factors that may or may not contribute to it...things like virus/bacteria type(maybe it's just something inherent to the way certain viruses and bacteria work...), things like immune system response and vaccine technology might come into play...even how often one is exposed to certain viruses might determine this...

And to answer your other question, yes vaccines for other virus also wane over time. Of those you listed I think only polio and measles are touted as ""lifelong""...smallpox immunity does wane...but not nearly as much as say the flu(decades vs as short as months for the latter).

&gt;MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Healthy and in their 30s, Christina and Josh Tidmore figured they were low-risk for COVID-19. With conflicting viewpoints about whether to get vaccinated against the virus filling their social media feeds and social circles, they decided to wait.

&gt;On July 20, Josh came home from work with a slight cough initially thought to be sinus trouble. On Aug. 11, he died of COVID-19 at a north Alabama hospital as Christina Tidmore witnessed a doctor and her team frantically try to resuscitate her husband.

&gt;”She would say, ’I need a pulse. ’I would hear, ‘no pulse,’ “Christina Tidmore said through tears. “They were trying so hard.”

&gt;”Nobody should go through this. He was only 36 and I’m 35 and we have three kids.”

&gt;She is now imploring young adults not to dismiss the risk and to consider getting vaccinated.

&gt;”Josh was completely healthy, active, not a smoker.” He would have turned 37 on Saturday.

&gt;Doctors say they are seeing a spike in cases among young adults and children as the highly contagious delta variant sweeps through unvaccinated populations. Medical officials say there is conflicting information on whether it makes people more severely ill or whether young people are more vulnerable to it, but it’s clear the contagiousness means more young people and children are getting sick.

&gt;”There is no question that the average age of people who are being hospitalized is going down,” State Health Officer Scott Harris said Friday.

&gt;”I don’t know if it’s clear that delta is worse in that age group or worse than any of the strains we’ve seen before. ... But what you have though is one that is just much, much more transmissible. Because seniors are the ones that are predominately the vaccinated population in our state, the most vulnerable are these younger people. So you see them getting infected at much higher rates than we had before.”

&gt;In the past four weeks, people ages 25 to 49 years, made up 14% of all COVID deaths in the state. And people 50 to 64 years made up about 29%.

&gt;The state is also seeing a surge in COVID cases among children, although deaths so far have been rare. The state this week set a record for pediatric hospitalizations with 50 children hospitalized with COVID-19.

&gt;In the past four weeks, 6% of cases of COVID-19 in Alabama have been among children under five while 8% have been among children between the ages of five and 17, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health.

&gt;”I am very concerned that the children of Alabama are experiencing more illness and hospitalizations as a result of COVID-19. Children can and do contract and spread COVID-19 disease. COVID-19 can be a very serious illness in children with at least 6% of children experiencing long-term consequences of this disease,” said Dr. Karen Landers, a pediatrician with the Alabama Department of Public Health.

&gt;The Alabama Hospital Association said this week that 85% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients are unvaccinated.

&gt;Christina Tidmore also had COVID-19 but recovered. She said she and her husband were not anti-vaccine, but heard conflicting information — including, she said, from doctors.

&gt;”It’s just a fight out there. This side and that side, and political garbage. ... You don’t know who to believe,” she said.

&gt;A jokester with a heart of gold, Josh loved to help others and to make people laugh, especially kids. He sauntered into Easter and Christmas gatherings wearing an inflatable dinosaur costume and ran around hugging family members. He would cheerfully photobomb beachgoers. He didn’t hesitate to rush to help a motorcyclist injured in an accident near the north Alabama church his grandparents founded.

&gt;”He could make you feel better when nobody else could. He would listen. He genuinely cared about everybody,” Christina Tidmore said.

&gt;The family is relying on their faith to get through and Christina Tidmore wants to share her husband’s story to help people — as Josh would have wanted.

&gt;”If you can try to save your life, then you probably should,” she said of vaccinations.

&gt;”I have lots of feelings and lots of regret and lots of what ifs,” she said. “”you don’t want to do that. You don’t.”",,,,1629572463,{},h9tj464,False,t3_p8vspm,False,True,t3_p8vspm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p8vspm/the_latest_more_young_healthy_die_of_virus_in/h9tj464/,1629637915.0,22,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just the term *breakthrough* is misleading now, since the vaccine was to protect you from alpha covid contraction, not delta contraction.  That certainly isn't new information in Isreal or anywhere else now.  It's not breaking through anything anymore.  Your delta varient is infecting you no matter your vaccination status.  The spike protein is changed and not hit by a firewall anymore at the door, like it was with delta.  We need an updated vaccine targeted to how delta infects you.

So vaccine antibodies help lesson your severity when you contract it, and you can and will easily contract it if you aren't wearing a good mosk and distancing.  How well your antibodies help you depends on your age and whether you got a robust response to the vaccine and made lots of lasting antibodies (much as with the flu vaccine), and your survivability is arguably based on your comorbidities, immune response, not just the vaccine antibodies.  There are plenty of people who have caught alpha twice, and delta, even now twice, and died for not getting regeneron but instead sent home, only to come back so sick within hours, that they die within a day of returning to the hospital.  Your chance of good care right now, too, or being treated well in a facility is lessening.  People are getting sick too fast to even get their PCR results back to start early enough on meds.

But ultimately that's minor as they are still highly effective at preventing severe disease and death, the secondary endpoint of the trials.

Cambridge’s Centre for Climate Repair is currently testing out some extreme climate change mitigation solutions. Their work on CO2 recycling is looking especially promising, and it helps that they’re partnering with relevant industry to make things scalable. That initiative was developed by Peter Styring of the University of Sheffield and being tested in the real world by Tata Steel. 

The wildfire work being done at UC Davis and out in Oregon is truly exciting. Not only are we finding ways to regrow native forests faster, we most recently found that proscriptive burns also work on megafires, something we hadn’t considered possible before. Remember the massive Bootleg Fire from last month? It was contained in part because it ran up against a wildlife preserve testing that burn maintenance method. This could totally change how we approach fire season. There are a number of research places around the Willamette Valley actively conducting tests, but if you want a few specific names, David Scarborough from Auburn has been doing really interesting work. Obviously if we can keep our trees alive, that’s a huge step in stabilizing our planet. 

There is a TON of work being done on reducing methane emissions from a variety of sources. This has a bunch of the studies and methods, which are incredibly promising, and the best part is that the methods we’re already rolling out are inexpensive. For example, did you know that by just feeding cows seaweed, we can cut cattle emissions by 82%? Here’s more info, and again, this is stuff we’re already putting into use: https://www.agweb.com/news/livestock/beef/feeding-cows-seaweed-could-reduce-cattle-methane-emissions-82

Kratom is a miracle for people who need to function and have severe pain but refuse to go back onto the pain pill merry-go-round or can't find a doctor to prescribe for their obvious incredible pain.

It wasn't her muscles that was the problem. Her brain just didn't know how to work her arm until LSD rewired her brain.) and all 3 of them have an LD50 so impossibly high that there has never been a recorded death from an overdose from them, including the people who snorted crystal LSD thinking it was cocaine, thus doing 1,000's of hits of LSD...

But I think the virus still has some time to run its course. I think by Spring most everything will be back to normal at least in the US. Boosters will be available if needed, kids should be able to get vaccinated, lots of people will have some previous exposure. This past spring/summer felt pretty open before this delta situation. Next fall/winter we could have an annual shot if needed. (Will say probably this could highly depend on whether the anti-vax natural infection have enough protection to save them from future hospitalization).

The situation now is much better than before though. I will say that until the vaccinated start really getting hospitalized. Even then we have some data that shows an additional booster will help if that starts to become an issue.

But yea don't be surprised if in a few months as fall/winter comes the situation ends up almost flipping the the US country. I won't be surprised to see the northeast and other areas having large numbers of cases. Many schools still haven't started and are potential for spread.

It's the response because the data points to it being true, and people are sensitive to the idea that people will see news of a breakthrough infection and assume that means the vaccine doesn't work (Because you would never see a news story about a time the vaccine *did* work so the news will always be skewed).

On that first page it mentions briefly that the ACA prevents insurance companies using health information to set premium rates. Before ACA a company could look at a whole myriad of information on you and sort you into risk pools and charge you accordingly. Under the ACA they can only look at a handful of these information. This helped everyone be accepted with insurance because they couldn’t denied coverage on a pre-existing condition. In this case on of the exceptions is smoking, it’s called the “Tobacco Surcharge” so the insurance company can charge you a certain % higher if you smoke to share the cost of treatment across all smokers. 

Off the top of my head (I’m not sure of this so no quoting) the other “demographics” they are limited to under the ACA in order to determine risk are geological location, age, gender, and one other I’m missing.

&gt;”If you come in by ambulance to a hospital, there’s not a bed to put you in,” said Seymour. “So you just stand in the hallway on the gurney, there’s no place to put you, there’s no place to treat you.”

&gt;Dr. Damon Darsey, emergency/EMS physician and patient care service at St. Dominic’s medical director for PatientCare EMS, says the impact isn’t just on the hospital. But EMS crews.

&gt; As you enter the healthcare system, whether they come from a clinic, emergency room or an ambulance, they all come into one location,” said Darsey. “Right now the ambulance services are being bottle-necked. At the one point where we are bottle-necking in the hospital... that’s emergency department. And so what we are learning from our EMS crews is they are truly our unsung heroes here.”

Taiwan's current COVID-19 Level 2 alert will remain in place and be further extended to Sept. 6, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said at the CECC's daily press briefing in Taipei.

Although the reported number of COVID-19 cases has slowed, authorities have continued to see sporadic domestic cases with unknown sources of infection, he said.

The two domestic cases on Saturday were both in New Taipei, Chen said, adding that the CECC has identified the source of infection in one of the cases and is looking into the source of the other.

Meanwhile, Taiwan reported eight new imported COVID-19 cases, two of which involved Taiwanese nationals who returned to the country from the United States and Albania on Aug. 18 and Aug. 19. 

The six others were citizens of India, Indonesia, South Africa and Japan, the CECC said.

According to the CECC, the eight people all tested positive for COVID-19 during their mandatory 14-day quarantine.

The country also confirmed one new death from COVID-19 on Saturday, involving a man in his 60s whose infection was confirmed on June 2 and who died on June 12.

During the press briefing, Chen announced that appointments for Taiwan's locally-developed COVID-19 vaccine would be opened again on Aug. 23 and Aug. 24.

He said this would allow an additional 200,000 people to receive their first jab of the vaccine, which was developed by Taiwan's Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp.

Based on CECC statistics as of Friday, more than 590,000 people above the age of 20 in Taiwan have already scheduled appointments to receive a Medigen shot.

Your logic is fundamentally flawed. I don't and shouldn't *need* a reason to *not* get vaccinated.

At any given time I'm *not* doing a conceivably *infinite* number of things. I'm not climbing Mt. Everest, today, or ever. I'm not pursuing a Ph.D. in cinema studies. I don't have to have an explanation for why I'm not; I'm simply not. It's my default state to *not* be doing any given thing at any given time.

You can go ahead and tell me why you think I *should*, why you think it's in my best interest to do a thing. And I'm free to ignore or reject those reasons and continue to not-do whatever I want. It's one of the greatest freedoms we have, to not-do something. My ancestors probably got whipped for not tending to the fields, now I'm a free man and can not-do at my own discretion. It's a beautiful thing, and you should try it.

The difference between me and you is *I don't care what you don't do*. And if you want to get vaccinated, then by all means, get vaccinated! I hope you feel safe now!

Also, to your point, the blunder was not to let vaccinated people go maskless, the blunder was not providing a verification tool to businesses to check vaccinations. The core of the surge has been because of unvaccinated people.  Additionally research from Singapore showed that even though vaccinated people can be vectors for transmission, they remain that was for a shorter period.  Which would imply the r0 is lower compared to the unvaccinated,

[],,hyouko,,,[],,,,text,t2_a0di5,False,False,[],"Those ""quick and efficient"" conversations at the desk you describe are _exactly_ what I appreciate getting away from.  Context switching is a huge productivity killer.  When someone sends me a Slack message and I am fully engaged with a task already, I can put off responding for 15-30min if I need to and finish working through my current train of thought.  When that same person is sitting next to my desk implicitly tapping their foot, I have to drop everything and deal with their request in the moment.

If you're the one doing the drive-by, it's great; you're right that there's probably no faster way to get an answer.  If you are the person everyone wants to stop by and talk to, your 2-hour free block of time for crunching on problems gets diced up into little 15-minute chunks.  Long term projects and anything requiring complex problem solving suffers.

I can see the benefit of whiteboards, but there are similar virtual tools baked directly into the conferencing tools we use (and it's easier to get a shareable, editable copy of what you come up with, too).  Drawing with a mouse is an acquired taste, but there are solutions to that, too, if it's an insurmountable problem.

Lastly, I'd say that for any inefficiencies introduced by being remote, being able to add 60+ minutes of productive and useful time to everyone's day by eliminating the commute is a massive handicap on in-office work.

&gt;Crowded medical facilities in Florida sometimes use liquid oxygen to treat Covid-19 patients who have trouble breathing, but the same product is used to help make water clean for drinking and other uses.

&gt;”Our hospitals are experiencing the highest number of unvaccinated, critically ill patients at this point as any other point during the pandemic,"" Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said at a news conference Friday. ""Many of these patients require liquid oxygen.""

&gt;Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has prohibited vaccine requirements by businesses and government and banned mask mandates in schools even as the state has set multiple records in August for new Covid-19 cases.

The team ran Ct analyses for samples received in May, June and July, when Delta was rapidly replacing other variants to become the dominant driver of COVID-19 in the country. **The results suggested that among people testing positive, those who had been vaccinated had a lower viral load on average than did unvaccinated people.

Red zones are alleys where a confirmed case has been detected for the last 2 weeks. Orange zones are at risk areas. Green zones are ""cleaned"" alleys where everyone has tested negative within the last 2 weeks. For red zones, things don't change much. The change is mostly a restriction on the green zones.

Although, judging by this [article](https://suckhoedoisong.vn/tphcm-khong-thuc-hien-tinh-trang-khan-cap-ve-dich-benh-169210821165126827.htm), that the green zones are still allowed outside is the the HCMC leaders' resisting the PM's total lockdown order. In the MoH article, the HCMC leaders cited that only the National Assembly could order the lockdown to resist the lockdown order and published the backpedal article you linked above this afternoon. Mind you, this is in spite of the military already getting here, and the PM's decision is widely supported by people in the city, despite what the Vietnam subreddit would want you to believe, so I fully expect that the National Assembly will pass the PM's lockdown decision. This is coming on the backdrop of the HCMC leaders gradually getting demoted, replaced, and hated by the people in the city for their piss-poor pandemic response and insistence on placing the economy over the people, so I don't really take the HCMC leaders' words this afternoon seriously as anything other than a last grab for power. In the end, the national government is still the big boss. The HCMC leaders' resistance is only going to kill more people, and this is sad.",,,,1629561898,{},h9svow4,True,t3_p8rz7r,False,True,t1_h9ssh3m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p8rz7r/vietnam_residents_crowd_supermarkets_stores/h9svow4/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,3c73e4db1c922dd385cc5a3c5bda84b0a2e3227c,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1629561914.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

“If you get infected, being vaccinated helps. The good news is that among Israel's serious infections on Thursday of this week, according to Health Ministry data, there were nine times more serious cases among unvaccinated people over age 60 (178.7 per 100,000) than among fully vaccinated people of the same age category, and a little more than double the number of serious infections among unvaccinated people in the under-60 crowd (3.2 per 100,000) than among the vaccinated in that age bracket.

The bad news, doctors say, is that half of Israel's seriously ill patients who are currently hospitalized were fully vaccinated at least five months ago. Most of them are over 60 years old and have comorbidities. The seriously ill patients who are unvaccinated are mostly young, healthy people whose condition deteriorated quickly.

Israel's daily average number of infections has nearly doubled in the past two weeks and has increased around tenfold since mid-July, approaching the numbers during Israel's peak in the winter. Deaths increased from five in June to at least 248 so far this month. Health officials say that currently 600 seriously ill patients are hospitalized, and they warn they cannot handle more than 1,000 serious infections at the same time.”",,,,1629574936,{},h9tof8s,False,t3_p8a6wu,False,True,t1_h9qxe62,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p8a6wu/highly_vaccinated_israel_is_seeing_a_dramatic/h9tof8s/,1629640799.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm glad you're doing your part. But here's a question for you: how critical are you of people who are vaccinated but unmasked or attending large gatherings? Would you tell them to wear masks and stay home? Do you call them out, or call them as ""selfish 5 year-olds"" when they don't go to the same lengths as you? Do you wish for large gatherings like music concerts to be canceled? Are the people who hold or attend large gatherings right now selfish from your perspective? Are you vocal about that notion to those people?

&gt;I want this to be over as much as anyone else so my kid can get back to having big parties and get togethers. The only way that happens is if we squash the virus as much as possible.

It's pretty much an endemic virus now. You can, at best, get vaccinated, and help mitigate your own chances of serious illness or hospitalization -- which I would recommend to anyone who feels like they're at serious risk. But you will most likely never live in a world where you simply can't get or spread COVID.

In previous waves, few patients with undiagnosed pathologies or no comorbidities were showing up in ICUs. The proportion is much greater now. Could a lot of the younger patients in hospitals now have undiagnosed pathologies or comorbidities? Conditions they were unaware of that make them more at risk? I don’t know. Doctors don’t seem to have an explanation either.

I think we’re gonna have to wait a bit longer for more specific details.

This is over when we have reached “best case scenario”. Things like the flu will never be gone gone. Maybe if people would have followed guidelines from day 1, we could have killed this off before it started. There are countries that succeeded in that. Now, because people were stubborn, we will likely have to suffice with cyclical vaccines, similar to the flu. That being said, flu vaccines are already available to the entire population, so I’m able to protect my child with a flu vaccine. Until we are in a comparable state, at a minimum, with COVID, people should sacrifice for the greater good instead of their own personal good, where able.

If Moderna is not fully approved but Pfizer is, from a technical point of view (more than just practical), does it ""make sense"" to keep administer it even though there is a fully approved vaccine? Let's forget that it's COVID, Covid vaccines that came almost together and all the stuff. If you could be offered one out of two drugs, one fully approved and one in EUA providing not any clear benefits more that the ones the approved drug already has, would you ever pick the EUA drug? But even more important, would the doctor even prescribe you it?

So far all the vaccines have been ""equal"", but from Monday there will be the first fully approved vaccine in the USA (and maybe West), and it's only one of the three. 

I'm suspecting USA would put Moderna and JJ more among the donation doses since it will ""need"" less for a while, but I'm wondering as well if EUA vaccines will still be administered when an approved one already exists.

At that moment, I had the worst panic attack I have ever had. Full on head trip. Asthma attack...I felt like I was going to have a stroke. Remember, Covid was so new, we only heard that it was a death sentence.  


I live in Michigan where weed is legal. I smoked illegal weed for four decades and when I can finally enjoy Cannabis without fear of the cops, I freaked out so hard that even now, I cannot enjoy low THC weed. Edibles are right out.

The problem with viruses and bacteria is that they replicate so rapidly in a matter of days you can have numerous generations. Regardless of whether we have a vaccine or not there would still be mutations. Now certain viruses with a particular mutation will be better adapted to infect, some will be better able to avoid your bodies antibodies. So what happens is that these become the dominant strain which is what we are seeing with Delta. There will be more mutations, as with any organism this happens randomly. The problem is people don’t understand the basics so then they say well then what’s the point of getting the vaccine. Well it still provides protection and what we are seeing from a medical standpoint is that even if you contract the delta variant you have minimal symptoms. The other reason is that if we can keep distancing ourselves for right now and also get the vaccine then we limit the ability for the virus to replicate and in effect stop becoming the host the virus needs to survive. That’s how you stop another mutation from becoming even deadlier and a new dominant strain that runs through the country. But unfortunately I do not think this will happen. For whatever reason a virus became a political talking point. I assure you Covid or any other virus/ bacteria does not care who you vote for. Ask HIV, Small Pox, or Polio.

Those who prioritized public health over the Republican's political agenda would be sanctioned......  
The DeSantis administration's statement read in part, ""The Florida Department of Education will then begin to withhold from state funds, on a monthly basis, an amount equal to 1/12 of the total annual compensation of the school board members who voted to impose the unlawful mask mandates until each district demonstrates compliance."".....  
And yet, there's Ron DeSantis, who suggested this week that mask protections have ""not proven to be effective,"" reality notwithstanding.....  
Federal intervention remains a possibility. President Biden spoke from the White House yesterday, announcing that he'd directed Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to ""use all of his authority, and legal action, if appropriate,"" to deter states from banning universal masking in classrooms.

Yes, and [64% of the population is fully vaccinated](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/vaccine/vaccine-dashboard.htm). 

I've given multiple links suggesting an efficacy against infection of between 70% and 90%, though I will concede that some experts think that it is lower (40%).

All of those numbers are much better than zero, so the vaccine passport policy is a good one.

However, they should do what they can to make things *safer*, and this policy does that.

It does find that rich kids with below average test scores are more likely to go to/graduate from college than poor kids with above average test scores. This is a really problematic finding.

However, this ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT mean that early school ""does shit all"" or that test scores do not matter. Indeed, test scores actually meant more for poor students -- for example, 43% of poor students with above-average math scores in 10th grade ultimately graduated from college, vs. 13% of poor students with below average scores (pg. 24 of the linked study).

In the beginning of the study they actually did try to treat the syphilis. The treatments just didn't work well. The study was started well before penicillin was wide spread. But for most of the study, they did withhold treatment. 

The other big problem with the study is that they never told the subjects they had syphilis which is a big ethical problem. It means they couldn't make informed decisions about the study or their treatment and where spreading the disease. Also IIRC some doctors where told not to treat or diagnosis the subjects so they would mess up the trial.

The study also just a shit design which makes the results worthless anyway.

In Tuskegee no one was injected with syphilis, people were found that already had syphilis and they were given placebo treatments instead of the real treatments known to work, and they were monitored along with a control group totaling almost 600. At no point was anyone actually injected with syphilis. Instead the government decided to study the progression of a disease that we already knew how to treat, and kept it secret until that study was leaked. With Covid-19 vaccines the control group, though there isn't a real one because credible scientists don't experiment on humans by infecting them with pathogens as dangerous as Covid-19, the control group in this case would actually be the people refusing vaccination and putting themselves at great danger of developing serious illness when that's avoidable with known preventative treatments (vaccines).

Furthermore, Tuskegee showed that an actual conspiracy of that importance and horrific nature tends to be outed by caring people in the know, and this vaccination program is WAY bigger than tuskegee, yet zero credible whistleblowers have come forward with evidence suggesting or proving the vaccine programs are some nefarious program being employed in ways counter to their claimed goals.

&gt;A professor who regularly smokes cigarettes in class would be reprimanded and eventually fired for endangering public health,” Fischer wrote. “But as COVID-19 hospitalizations surge in Alabama, classrooms packed tightly with scores of unvaccinated students wearing cheap, ill-fitting masks strike me as a far greater and more urgent danger to the public health than secondhand smoke.

&gt;”Unfortunately, however, not only are such gatherings permitted at UAH, but professors who refuse on public health grounds to convene them are themselves subject to disciplinary proceedings,” Fischer wrote.

&gt;Fischer said this is a moral issue that should be regarded “alongside the 1918 flu and the Tuskegee Study.” The Tuskegee Study was a years’ long medical tracking of Black Alabama men with syphilis that continued without intervention even after a treatment was known. The 1918 flu was the worst pandemic in world history with an estimated 50 million deaths. About 4.1 million people have died from COVID.

&gt;In correspondence with AL.com this week, Fischer said he directly contacted senior administrators of the University of Alabama system on behalf of 135 university employees who signed a petition to modify the school’s COVID policies to require masks and social distancing in classes and allow faculty and staff concerned about safety to work from home or take unpaid leave. The first to sign that petition was UAH’s touted space physicist Dr. Gary Zank, a member of the National Academy of Sciences. “No senior administrator ever responded to the substance of that petition,” Fischer said.

In addition, vaccinated people clear their viral loads much faster than unvaccinated, meaning that they won't be infectious for as long, meaning that it is less likely for a vaccinated person in the bar/restaurant to spread the disease.

As one example personal to me, they approved Ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones in the past as an antibiotic without warnings, which has led to doctors relying on them and prescribing them heavily, but they have since been linked with all sorts of significant and severe side effects, and may have been what actually caused Gulf War Syndrome in so many soldiers deployed in the Gulf War.

https://www.militarytimes.com/2013/11/01/new-fda-warnings-on-cipro-may-tie-into-gulf-war-illness/

The FDA has since multiple times had major warnings added to the drug. ""The FDA first added a Boxed Warning to fluoroquinolones in July 2008 for the increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture. In February 2011, the risk of worsening symptoms for those with myasthenia gravis was added to the Boxed Warning. In August 2013, the agency required updates to the labeling to describe the potential for irreversible peripheral neuropathy (serious nerve damage).""

https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-updates-warnings-fluoroquinolone-antibiotics-risks-mental-health-and-low-blood-sugar-adverse

I got the peripheral neuropathy, and possibly other issues. The urologist said ""I'm prescribing you an antibiotic"" with zero warnings so at worst I assumed I'd have fucked up gut flora from taking the pills. After taking the very first pill I was feeling tingling in my arms and legs. It took four more pills and more intense nerve tingling all over my body, including my face, before I made the connection, called my doctor, and had it switched. I kept feeling the neuropathy off and on for seven years afterwards. The neuropathy is pretty much gone now though, finally, but it's crazy that just a few pills can have such a terrible reaction.

That being said, I got the Pfizer vaccine as soon as I could. I was far more concerned about Covid-19, and by the time I was eligible anyway (April) tons of people already had the vaccine and it was pretty clear what the immediate side effects would be, and were definitely very minor. 

But I used to default to always blindly trusting whatever my doctors or health organizations told me to do, and I had to learn the hard way to be a little more skeptical of what they tell me and I definitely research anything I don't recognize that's prescribed or recommended to me now. I had my doctor recommend Saxenda the other day to help bring my weight down, and I'm still on the fence about it, because even though it's FDA approved and there's some serious praise online from people who have taken it, there's still this to be concerned about:

""However, reports of dangerous side effects including pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer have once again raised questions about whether the drugs’ risks outweigh their benefits. Some of the people who suffered from these side effects  are now in the midst of filling lawsuits for the injuries they have sustained.""

Can you pinpoint why I'm wrong? Or are they just voices in your head?  
I can, start by showing you data on deaths between 0 and 17 years old from flu in the united states in the seasons 2017/2018 - 643 deaths \[1\] and 2018/2019 - 437 deaths \[2\].  
And now compare with data provided by the same agency for covid deaths in people between 0 and 18 (they include one year more than in the flu analysis) years in the period Jan/2020 to August/2021 - 430 \[3\]  
It should also be noted that the flu data refer to deaths per year and the covid data refer to deaths for 17 months.  
I live in Portugal, I tried to find oficial data on deaths by age for influenza and covid and I can't find data that can be compared. The best I found was news from national newspapers reporting the deaths of children ( The oldest I saw was 10 years old ). In total there are 5 and all with associated comorbidities. I don't think they would miss the chance to report more if there was, but I could be wrong.  
But if you analyze, through the official Portuguese government statistics website \[4\], the total deaths by age during the last 10 years you will see that there was no excess mortality in people under 60 in 2020.

The only people allowed to be tested were those who were like... admitted to the hospital with a high fever and cough AND had recently been in China.

It was unbelievable how fast and how hard the city shut down once we realized what was happening. Within a week the city was dead, silent and empty. Everything was closed besides hospitals, pharmacies, and grocery stores. Nobody went outside unless it was to get supplies. And then everyone stayed inside for at least two months. Two months in a tiny shoebox apartment! No yards!

And then when all of the sick people started needing hospitalization, we didn't know how to treat them properly. Turns out putting covid patients on vents immediately is a good way to lead to bad outcomes. There's a reason why the death rate has dropped over the last year, and that reason is that we learned out not to inadvertently kill covid patients.

After one hour of waiting, the man finally got the paper for a 7am appointment.  
  
The man and other customers waited an hour in a queue before the supermarket opened. Some people at other food stores, however, had to return home as they were too crowded.  
  
Mega Market An Phú in Thủ Đức City, for example, opened at 7am but later closed because of the number of customers. The store staff asked customers waiting in the morning to return in the afternoon.  
  
A 52-year-old woman from Thủ Đức City had to go back home on Friday because most of the shelves were empty. She returned later but it was too crowded with customers.

Besides supermarkets, many drugstores in the city were also crowded Saturday morning.  
  
Unlike the deserted streets seen previously, many streets were busy, such as Phan Văn Trị, Lê Đức Thọ, Dương Quảng Hàm, Quang Trung in Gò Vấp District, Âu Cơ and Trường Chinh in Tân Bình District, and Tô Hiến Thành and Cách Mạng Tháng 8 in District 10.  
  
Because of the large number of people travelling on streets, many checkpoints lifted restrictions.  
  
On Saturday morning, Phan Văn Mãi, vice secretary of the city's Party Committee, said the city would ensure supply of goods and daily necessities for its people.

The teams will work with the city’s War Veterans’ Association, Women Veterans' Association, Women's Union and the Hồ Chí Minh Communist Youth Union to carry out food delivery and supervise locked-down and quarantine areas.  
  
Lương has asked military and police forces, Government agencies and the trade and industry sector to work together to ensure food and essential goods for the city’s people in the next two weeks.  
  
Phạm Thị Thắng, vice chairwoman of the city People’s Committee, said the city has assessed the nutritional value of food and specific quantity and kinds of essential goods (rice, sugar, fish sauce, cooking oil, etc) needed for daily use.  
  
The Department of Industry and Trade has been asked to work with the city's 24 districts and Thủ Đức City authorities to collect people’s opinions about whether the food should be free or paid for.  
  
The city People’s Committee has proposed that the Ministry of National Defence and General Staff of the Việt Nam People's Army send 4,000 soldiers from the Military Region, 7,400 doctors and 1,600 medical staff, and 30 ambulances with drivers and emergency medical workers to help the city.  
  
Senior Lieutenant General Lương said a military medical force has been mobilised to support the city.  
  
More than 300 doctors and students from the Military Medical University in Hà Nội on Friday were sent to HCM City.  
  
An additional 1,000 military medical workers from Hà Nội and northern provinces are expected to arrive from August 21-23. They will work with the city’s mobile clinics and community-based COVID-19 prevention teams to provide treatment and medical support to COVID-19 patients isolated at home.  
  
They will also give COVID-19 tests and vaccinations, and deal with other emergency cases.  
  
Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam said at an online conference with city leaders on Friday that the city must focus on social welfare and safety for people during the strict social distancing period.  
  
Đam asked the city and the ministries of National Defence, Public Security and Health to issue specific plans and tasks for forces on duty, all of whom must be tested and vaccinated.  
  
The city on Friday announced it was tightening prevention measures from 12am on Monday (August 23) for 15 days with the aim of controlling the outbreak by September 15 under the Government's Resolution 86.  
  
The city asked people to ""stay where they are” at all times, and strictly follow safe distancing among individuals, families, residential areas and wards. — VNS  
  
  
The Vietnam Military Medical University this morning sent 60 teams with a total of 295 staff and students to HCM City and southern provinces to serve COVID-19 prevention and control. Each team, including two doctors and three students, will go to COVID-19 patients' homes to treat both physical and psychological problems.   
  
Next week, more than 100 teams will be sent to HCM City and southern provinces. Previously, the Vietnam Military Medical University set up five teams and a testing centre in HCM City.

Preventing death, but creating more asymptomatic carriers cannot stop an epidemic, but could cause more infections. A swift death of the host would do more to stop spread. But preventing deaths itself is a good goal. Even if the vaccines led to more cases, I would still support vaccination of the most at-risk as a way to prevent the most severe of outcomes.

Abstract

&amp;#x200B;

  
Objective:  
This study was conducted to evaluate the persisting Covid-19-related symptoms of the cases included in our study and to assess their cardiac findings in order to determine the impact of Covid-19 on children’s cardiovascular health.  
Methods:  
In this study, 121 children between the ages of 0-18 with Covid-19 were evaluated based on their history, blood pressure values, and electrocardiography and echocardiography results. These findings were compared with the findings of the control group which consisted of 95 healthy cases who were in the same age range as the study group and did not have Covid-19. The results were evaluated using the statistics program, SPSS 21.  
Results:  
There was no significant difference between the study group and the control group in terms of age, weight, and body mass index. The clinical symptoms (chest and back pain, dizziness, headache, palpitation, fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of balance, coughing) of 37.2% of the cases persisted at least 1 month after Covid-19 recovery. Statistically significant differences were found in systolic blood pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction, relative wall thickness, and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion.  
Conclusion:  
The continuation of some cases’ clinical symptoms post-recovery indicates that long Covid infection can be observed in children. The fact that statistically significant differences were observed between the echocardiographic parameters of the study and control groups suggests that Covid-19 may have effects on the cardiovascular system. To shed light on the long Covid cases among children and the infection’s cardiac impacts, it would be beneficial to conduct more comprehensive studies on this matter.",,,,1629556799,{},h9skkp4,True,t3_p8sl1b,False,False,t3_p8sl1b,/r/Coronavirus/comments/p8sl1b/intriguing_new_faces_of_covid19_persisting/h9skkp4/,1629620660.0,19,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Groceries were delivered and I wouldn’t let her touch anything until they’d been decontaminated or removed them from packaging. I was hyper-vigilant and only went to work and back, put my clothes in a container by the door, showered, and wiped everything down.

I thought I must have given it to her but tested negative so... It was a pretty scary time and a horrible illness, even though she recovered at home. 

The vaccines are pretty safe and effective, and worth leaving the house for. You almost certainly eat, take, or use things that are much less safe and studied. Covid is everywhere and chances are you’ll have to go somewhere someday (post office, dentist, etc). It’s really not worth the risk of getting Covid without a vaccine.

COVID-19 is a viral disease.  The perceived severity is based on it's reproductive rate and the body's response to the virus.

Vaccination primes the body to be able to respond more effectively more quickly.  It's not a guarantee of anything.  Most people will have mild or asymptomatic infections once vaccinated, but that's not a guarantee, and no one should be claiming that.

It's also possible you were exposed to a large concentration of the virus, which may be enough to overwhelm the primed immune system.  Also possible your vaccination didn't produce a significant immune response.  Also possible you have a breakthrough variant that's going to mess us all up shortly... There's really no way of knowing.

Regardless, no one should be using imprecise language or guaranteeing anything.  The vaccines work, and there are studies that show they work, but it's the real world.

He asked two questions, the second question was whether hospital staff were going to deprioritize patients who had chosen not to get the vaccine. Kate Brown turns the question over to Dr. Jeff Absalon, Chief Physician Executive for St. Charles Hospital in Bend, OR. Dr. Absolon says ""at this point in time it is not happening in this state"" but says that we are in a dire situation and he cannot predict where things will go. He says a few more things but doesn't really specifically answer yes or no. Then Dr. Sidelinger, the state epidemiologist, (bow tie guy), asks if he can add something in and so he goes on to say that to deprioritize the unvaccinated is a ""gut reaction"" and that they have a framework already established for prioritizing patients in these types of situations. He said that healthcare professional do not prioritize patients based on personal choices. He said ""it won't come down to making a decision based on the vaccines you chose to get or not get""... then he redirects and pivots to encouraging everyone to get some kind of vaccine thing... I don't know. Some vaccine that he was pitching. He says we all need to get it. :)

Influenza, the thing everyone compares to SARS-CoV-2, mutates roughly every 18-24 months. Flu vaccines roll out at that same cadence to keep up. Sometimes we mess up our formulation and its not very effective. Those are tough years for flu. 

COVID OTOH mutates far more quickly. We're now at roughly the 18 month mark and looking at a *Gamma* variant. There are no fewer than 4 actively circulating COVID pathogens, and with the high number of available hosts, ample opportunity to spawn new ones. We have a vaccine made for Alpha.

Making matters worse, not only does Delta show a greater risk of reinfection, Gamma shows a still higher risk with something like 20% of Gamma variant cases being folks with prior infections. This wont ""burn through"", its just going to wear people down and make dead bodies until we can, as a species, get our act together.

&gt; The researchers added the gene for the coronavirus spike protein to another virus called an adenovirus. Adenoviruses are common viruses that typically cause colds or flu-like symptoms. The Oxford-AstraZeneca team used a modified version of a chimpanzee adenovirus, known as ChAdOx1. It can enter cells, but it can’t replicate inside them.

Now, this isn’t to say that your concern isn’t viable or that you need to get over it and throw caution to the wind — but, when thinking through this, keep in mind that long term side effects are probably rare, and we aren’t (yet) aware of any RNA virus (like the one that causes covid) which cause long term effects. 

So, we don’t know yet. And it’s something to keep in mind, but not completely shape our lives over for the next decade while waiting for studies. I hope there’s nothing that comes out of covid infection that involves long term side effects, but we don’t know and we won’t for some time to come.

If your parents are unwilling, you must no longer be a dependent on them (aka no health insurance, car insurance, etc. which is usually covered if you live at home or are listed as a dependent that is a college student). This can be impossible for someone like me who has $50 in combined checking and savings from week to week, working full time and overtime. Some kids can’t make ends meet and still attend college, which leads to them dropping out after a year or so. I’m lucky that my parents support me, otherwise I’d be trapped trying to constantly keep a roof over my head while working 70+ hours a week and attending college full time. Making college free (at least state college) is essential. My state offers academic scholarships to in-state students, which is the only way I’m able to get my degree.

College is almost a requirement at this point, at least if you want a decent job in most fields that aren’t special trades (which trade school is for).

Yes, the number of variants has grown. Yes, vaccination has also grown. But there is also a very large number of unvaccinated folks as well globally, and they’re still likely the largest segment of the population spreading the virus. 

The number of mutations is growing because the variants and their sub-variants are much better at multiplying. It’s easier to see more mutations when a virus produces roughly 1000x more copies successfully each person it infects (as is the case with delta).

I don't think that's even debatable.  I don't care what digital age we're in, you cannot replace face to face human interaction.  The question is more like ""are the benefits of the office actually worth it"", because WFH has some pretty huge benefits too (commute time removed, rent saved, etc).  Can't say I have an answer to that question.

One other thing I would point out though is that I strongly believe that one of the major reasons WFH has been working well for many businesses this past year is because of the relationships that formed pre-covid.  Social relationships between coworkers are extremely important for ""greasing the wheels"" of operation.  I work with a handful of colleagues now who no one has ever met, and the dynamic with them is noticeably different than it is between those of us who know each other from before.

- Philosophical allies. You probably had pretty substantial similarities to them, although that didn't prevent heated debate. In general you would agree with them. But, on finer points - and some not so fine - there could be extensive discussion. Examples might be Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglas during the abolitionist movement.

- ""The loyal opposition"". Pretty major differences of opinion; however, still respected each other and would accept when they were wrong when in argument. Ultimately your goals may be the same, they just have a different path. Sometimes a widely different path, even if the destination is the same or similar. Although fictionalized in the movie ""Inherit the Wind"" and more about McCarthyism than the actual Scopes ""Monkey"" Trial, Henry Drummond and Matthew Harrison Brady are possible examples here.

- The disingenuous / ""terrain features"". They engage in the Gish Gallop and other logical fallacies as they really don't respect you or the debate at all, will answer with ""I know what I know"", pose rhetorical questions that are dangerously leading... more or less the types we have to deal with who are ""Just asking questions, *what's wrong with that?*"". Examples abound in the modern day.

We could be either of the first two and were often assigned one of them in a debate. Intentionally engage in the third (he'd sometimes jump in with that to see how you'd defend against it) and you'd find yourself at his displeasure. My favorite was ""Gish galloping again?

Let's assume a 1% death rate from Covid, because they're always citing that 99% survival rate. There are about 150,000 commercial flights a day worldwide. If 1,500 of them crashed every day, every single day, would she get on a plane?

Like the initial vaccination, although shots were rare at the time, will see how large groups of people respond, like doctors/nurses getting third shot as they were first in december. If there really are no issues, downsides, and it's that simple I will highly consider.

But seeing a lot about antibodies waning but not quite a lot about understanding long term immunity which could prevent severe infection and hospitalization, which I guess this far has been the case, although haven't followed the Israel situation closely. I think tons of vaccinated people are still getting it but fairing fine, and wonder if a small asymptomatic encounter boost the antibodies in itself. Again would like to see some studies not just ancedotal antibody reports.

Only two things I see so far is the vaccine might not prevent from spreading, where at least kids for now can't quite protect themselves (after widespread approval yea it's a bit of personal responsibility from here out if the person next to me didn't get vaccinated). The other more concerning thing I see so far is recent reports of long Covid symptoms potentially in vaccinated individuals which definitely worries me a bit.

If there was a disease out there that caused 10% of people’s hair to turn blue but only 1 out of 100 people got the disease a year then 0.1 out of 100 peoples hair would turn blue. If they came out with a vaccine that only cause 2% of peoples hair to turn blue then 2 out of 100 treated people would get blue hair.  That’s 20 times the amount of people who are getting blue hair from the disease but you could say the vaccine is 5 times less likely to give you blue hair than the disease. 

So saying COVID is more likely to cause myocarditis than the vaccine is only an apple to apples comparison if we know for sure that 100% of people are going to get COVID.

My eyes said 'coronavirus should spread like wildfire', because there were 100 people in a bus and other high-risk activities. There were covid deaths, but it was all quite manageable, and there really wasn't too much disruption to life.

This time is different, the Delta variant is clearly far more virulent. Where I live no-one is tested. They do not want to be tested because they are scared of being sent off to a hospital and not seen again (dying isolated from their families, which definitely was the rule last year, because I was involved; not sure now). There is a notable uptick in deaths (the funerals take place on the side of the road so you can see what is going on). Speaking to people a very high proportion of people have covid right now, or in the recent past.

We hired a driver last Friday (13th) to go out for the day. The driver was ill. He had been ill for 2 weeks from what I can see. He claimed to be better. No vaccine.

I asked him after we came back (he was coughing during the trip) 'do you have coronavirus', he said 'no I was tested at the clinic, and negative'. I believe he was lying, because as mentioned nobody is going to go and get tested because people do not trust the government. 

Anyway after my girlfriend was infected with flu-like symptoms (cough, blocked nose, tiredness) I said 'you have covid'. She  said 'I don't have covid, I have flu, I don't have loss of taste or fever'. I said 'I don't care. Everyone has got covid at the moment. Flu is not spreading because covid is so good at spreading you clearly have covid. It's blindingly obvious you have covid, the symptoms are highly variable.'

 I ordered some antigen tests online. She and I both fully vaccinated with the rather weak Chinese Sinovac vaccine. She was positive, I was not. 

Walking around it's obvious that a very very high % of the population have covid. Mask wearing is low. There is no social distancing. One unmasked woman in the market said to the vendor 'I have lost my sense of taste'.  

Most people do not believe in covid, and claim that you can be tested positive because you are pregnant or whatever. 

It's a shit show.

Without data there is no science. All we have left is comparing opinions and trying to assess the relative value of the opinions. \*sigh\* Based on media reporting (which I don't trust) and some independent data collection and analysis from Mayo and academic teaching hospitals where research is still supported, breakthrough infections are on the rise, particularly from Delta.

Excess fiber (~70g/day) is going to cause inflammation, and inflammation is just generally harmful. Probiotics will be more helpful in rebuilding gut flora.

And chia seeds, while boring, are insanely filling (and you can cut the Optifiber completely if you eat chia seeds.) Skinless, boiled or baked chicken is very filling, too.

* I work full time, for a very cautious university luckily, so my work is still from my home, but there's no guarantee that I won't be called back in the middle of her semester. I also already spent the last year splitting my attention and my performance did suffer. 

* She's been there for two days so far. She really understands she needs to wear her mask. She desperately wants new friends, and she's making them. She is upholding her promises to be safe. I feel a bit monstrous thinking about taking that away.

* I just started a masters degree program in analytics during the summer when things were looking rosier. 

* My husband has a labor intensive job with a bi-weekly repeating schedule of 12 hour days that frequently calls for mandatory overtime. He can offer to do some teaching, but he may not be able to actually follow through.

Every patient that needs to be in a hospital that can't be admitted **WILL DIE**.  

Patients that need to be in a hospital, but  are sent home because hospitals are full will need to be cared for by their family.   The family will be constantly exposed to very high levels of covid virus, everyone in the family will get sick, and since everyone is sick and they are all stuck at home, they will be passing the virus back and forth to each other.  This is how entire families die.    

The COVID hospitalization rate is about 12%, Covid hospital stays are long usually 10-14 days.  

When hospitals fill up the death rate can climb as high the hospitalization rate, which is about 12%.   

Since only about 1/2 the population is unvaccinated, and the other 50% are vaccinated, but with 3 different vaccines that are all partially effective, it's the perfect environment to create a super variant.

And the Chinese model can't really be copied by individual ""small countries"", and by ""small"" I include countries potentially even like Italy and Germany. China has an enormous domestic population that allows it to sustain decent levels of tourism and consumption while very locked off from the rest of the world. There's also minimal border control required compared to its size -- most of China's land borders have sparsely populated neighbours or untraversable terrain, and  sea arrivals are negligible.

People were less inclined to take it seriously and poorly educated on that sort of thing in general. Medicine was still pretty wild back then. 

The second wave hit in the fall after a bunch of major cities literally decided to throw big Armistice Day parades and celebrations in the middle of a flu pandemic while knowing the risks. That wave was much deadlier and more intense. They had terrible hospital staffing shortages, had to close down businesses like theaters or have staggered schedules. Young people got incredibly sick. People were asked not to crowd public transport and to get as much fresh air as possible. 195,000 people died in October alone. 

The third wave came on the heels of the second and was still brutal but less so because we were finally focusing on public education and redesigning spaces for more ventilation to stop the spread. Radiators look the way they do because of 1918. 

The flu finally receded in spring when it warmed up (like Covid) and generally faded out because it had infected so many people globally. Then it mutated into a harmless strain we still have around.
