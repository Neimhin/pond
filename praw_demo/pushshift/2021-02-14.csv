June 2020 unacceptable response from China.  The idea of stonewalling in virology is both abhorrent and  selfish.  You represent that you know.  Tell us.  We are all ears, waiting for you to tell the world.  Why is China refusing to release sequences that are in China's eyes worthless, and not worth releasing.   China is withholding sequences.  You must know.  You tell us why.  Your reply is as I observed, abhorrent.  The world is not blind  WHO is not blind.

And again, the same request, now, 8 months later, WHO again asks for the same sequences.  They think it important for the world.  They sent a delegation to discuss this issue.

Why would EU say that? These are private companies, that operate in a global market, not state owned companies. Or USA and UK are the new China? EU signed contracts with expected delivery times and vaccine amounts.

The reality is that EU should have done that - slapped export bans like UK and USA, easy.

What happened was, one woman infects her downstairs neighbor who used the elevator. ONE PERSON. Bad luck. It happens.

*BUT* that neighbor's mom was visiting overnight. Mom later goes home to her boyfriend. Some days later, Mom and Mom's Boyfriend go to a party. Party Host and his sons ends up with covid. Party Host is hospitalized, then transferred to a different hospital. 20 people catch it from Party Host at the first hospital. 28 people get it from him at the second hospital. So yes, technically that outbreak ended up infecting 71 people total. But only one person caught it from an elevator.

So the lesson here is still that catching covid from an elevator ride is rare. Extended family visits at home are high risk. Parties are high risk. Health care workers are unfortunately at higher risk in their work environment. We know this already.

Two patients in Hanoi are a 24-year-old woman in Ba Dinh District and a 43-year-old Japanese man in the Somerset West Point hotel of Tay Ho District, both associated with a deceased Japanese man who stayed at the hotel and was found dead before being confirmed a Covid-19 patient Monday morning. His cause of death is yet to be determined.

The two have been in close contact with the deceased man at a meeting on Feb. 2, according to the Hanoi Center for Disease Control (CDC). They are now being treated at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, according to the Ministry of Health.

The deceased man had been quarantined for two weeks upon entering HCMC from Japan, during which time he tested negative for the coronavirus twice. Then he flew to Hanoi on February 1 before being found dead on February 13.

Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long has said it's more likely that he was infected in Hanoi.

Chu Xuan Dung, Hanoi's vice chairman, on Monday ordered local authorities to close street restaurants, coffee shops and historical and religious sites from Tuesday to prevent further Covid-19 spread.

The 38 other patients are in Hai Duong, all being close contacts of previously confirmed coronavirus cases. They are being treated at local field hospitals.

Hai Duong, the epicenter of a new coronavirus outbreak that has swept through 13 cities and provinces since late last month, would undergo social distancing starting Tuesday for 15 days to stem the spread of the virus.

Minister Long said at a Monday meeting that extinguishing outbreaks in the province, home to more than two million people, has been difficult as contact tracing and testing are not being carried out fast enough.

Long said infection sources still lurk inside the community despite authorities having collected and tested around 90,000 people, as people are getting infected faster than they could be traced, tested and isolated.

Mismanagement inside quarantine zones is also an issue, as the sheer number of people inside such zones combined with improper quarantine procedures means there were cross-infections inside the zones themselves, he said.

As a result, Long has requested Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc to put all large centralized quarantine zones in Hai Duong under the management of the army instead of civilians.

Vietnam's total Covid-19 infection tally is now 2,269, including 690 active cases. Around 150,000 are in quarantine nationwide, either in hospitals, quarantine zones or at home.""",,,1613402820,{},gnji0cx,True,t3_lkftpr,False,True,t3_lkftpr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lkftpr/vietnam_records_40_new_coronavirus_cases_as_hai/gnji0cx/,1613402831,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_10wdsu,False,False,,

[],,A9852360,,,,,,[],"Yes the UK did give advance warning. The UK's agreement with AZ gives the UK the first 100 million doses produced in the factories in the UK, funded by the UK govt. AZ were well aware of that 3 months before the EU even signed a deal meaning they were never under the impression that the UK factories could be utilised for the EU, or at least not until well in 2021. Therefore they planned to use factories in the EU to meet these contracts, however, due to the delays in the EU signing a contract the ability to meet the delivery schedules was impacted.

If the EU doesn't have to give notice then expect outrage when you try and block exports with no notice, especially when they are exports from a company unrelated to the one the EU was having a disagreement with. Also as I said previously, added bonus for when you try and torch a peace agreement at the same time without even informing the Irish govt.

""  Every contract is being fulfilled, yet EU contracts are missing deadlines and deliveries, and overall breach of contractual obligations - hiding behind production problems, **when in reality they are favoring some contracts over others**. ""

This just shows how uninformed you are. The UK's first deliveries from AZ were due in Q4 2020 (same amount of time after contract was signed as the EU's first). That first set of deliveries were supposed to be 30 million doses. At the end of Q4, the UK had less than 0.5 million. So how is the EU getting 40% of it's contracted number of doses so much worse than the UK getting less than 2%. The UK, Canada etc. are also suffering from similar reductions as the EU is from Pfizer. So overall you are completely uninformed on the topic.

"" Yes, google the delays about liability - there are plenty of articles about this in the FT, etc. "" No there aren't. They may say liability was part of it but not the entire reason as you claimed. Why don't you provide a link if there are so many.

"" This is bullshit lol, AZ didn't flinch to say they wouldn't deliver due to the delay, and only give notification that they would fail to deliver **70 MILLION OUT OF 100 MILLION ORDER WITH 8 WEEKS NOTICE**, like they didn't realize before they would fail to deliver more then 50% of the order lol - but worry not, after contract was published the production improved somehow. ""

No it's not. Yes they did inform the EU late but that doesn't prove anything is bullshit. The UK factories also had teething issues that required working out but severely reduced the initial deliveries but just had them sorted by 2021 due to that extra 3 months. The EU didn't have those 3 months so the delays are still having an impact. Production improved marginally, claiming the publication of the contract had any real impact is delusional. Production was also going to improve as the issues worked through and the EU media just claimed that an extra 8 million was some huge win despite it still meaning they were missing 50%.

Overall your argument is based on anger and misinformation. You started off by asking why the UK and USA didn't face outrage when they blocked exports (not that the UK has done that) and then when I explained why you got angry. If you don't see why informing companies and their customers of your intentions then you deserve the outrage you get. Just because they are within your borders does not mean you can act with impunity and not face criticism by the global market. If you don't understand that then you aren't mature enough for this to be worth continuing. You also have a basic misunderstanding of the facts and are under the delusion that only the EU is facing shortages or reduced deliveries. This is simply not the case but seems to be a driving part of your anger.

I'm sure I've replied most of this to you before and you still don't get it or most likely choose not to. You want to portray this image that the EU is suffering due to cruel organisations and companies to hide from reality that unfortunately the EU has made mistakes in this.

We aren't trying to claim we have it worse than anyone else, nor are we asking for any pity. However, it has been almost a year since the majority of travel bans came in place now, and for many this means over a year since they got to physically be with their partner. Several countries have put exemptions in place for couples, providing couples give proof of their relationship and still follow whatever testing and quarantine requirement is in place, but for the most part couples have been forced apart and barely acknowledged this entire time.

Now, fair enough if there was some kind of light and hope at the end of the tunnel, but as it stands there is no timeline for when restrictions might end, and if anything, more restrictions seem to be coming into place every day. I urge people, if they have the chance, to look into the Love Is Not Tourism movement.

So there have been lots of comments that have piqued my interest. One of them was talking about how we should feel sympathy for anti-lockdowners but not anti-maskers. The issue with that is that the word anti-maskers has a broad definition. For example, some pro-lockdown people can say that anybody questioning the effectiveness of lockdowns and mask mandates or tries to point out the negative effects of either is a COVID denier and an anti-masker. On one hand, we do not question the efficacy of mask mandates (or question it to some degree but we still know that masks work). On the other hand, we question the claims of masks being a zero cost measure and acknowledge the negative effects of masks. To some people, we may be seen as anti-maskers, and to others, we may be seen as pro-maskers. Imo, we are anti-maskers, but reasonable anti-maskers, not crazy anti-maskers. We are not against mask mandates in the short term, but we are against them after a couple of months. Plus, we are pro-vaccine and have reasonable reasons to hate masks (i.e. : we don’t believe that masks should stay after all older people/at risk people (except those who straight up refuse the vaccine) have been vaccinated), not just muh freedumbs and other dumb reasons.

The technology is over two decades in the making. Furthermore, the main reasons clinical trials take so long are:

1. Finding enough people to volunteer for each phase

2. Waiting for enough of said volunteers to get infected that a reasonable analysis can be made. 


In the case of this vaccine, they never had to wait to find enough volunteers to field the next phase. They had ample numbers of volunteers to fill both cohorts including all special cases. .Additionally, the contagiousness of the virus allowed us to rapidly reach numbers which were reasonable for establishing efficacy. So the time line was shorter than normal but it isn't due to short cuts taken by the FDA/researchers/etc. it was due to having enough people to finish things. 

As for safety, we have never had a better understanding of safety than we do with these vaccines. Starting at the clinical trial stage where the trials did a great job of involving minorities, women, etc. These groups are important because they often under-represented in clinical trials and, as a result, end up often having higher rates of unexpected adverse reactions.

King's family denied rumors that he died from COVID-19

Shawn Southwick King, his estranged wife, initially pushed back against speculation that King died of COVID-19.
""It was an infection, it was sepsis,"" she told Entertainment Tonight in January. 

""He was finally ready to go, I will tell you that. You know, he never wanted to go, but his sweet little body was just, it had just been hit so many times with so many things, and once we heard the word COVID, all of our hearts just sunk,"" said Shawn.
She continued that ""he beat it, but it did take its toll and then the unrelated infection finally is what took him, but boy, he was not gonna go down easily.""",,,1613428258,{},gnkyoop,True,t3_lknzdc,False,True,t3_lknzdc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lknzdc/larry_king_official_cause_of_death_was_sepsis_not/gnkyoop/,1613429192,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_8a3adueo,False,False,,

Firstly, Australia's population is overwhelmingly packed into its major 5 cities and a few other relatively dense regions - all you had to do was see Victoria's second wave last year to see that the virus spreads just as rapidly here (until it's managed). Australia is really no different to major states in America - huge cities with rural areas - and in practice, Australia has pretty typical density.

Secondly, the virus doesn't care about the size of an ocean. Australian's travel overseas very regularly (over 10 million a year) and we typically have almost 10 million tourists a year as well. The difference isn't being surrounded by an ocean at all, the difference is that we shut down all but *pivotal* border travel, and each state developed a hotel quarantine system, organised with the federal government, to isolate returning travellers in for 14 days. It's as simple as that.

It's not causing cases to rise right now, so it can't be \*that\* prevalent here.

Yes in case you didn't realize this study, like others that China has done show that the actual case numbers were quite a bit higher, hardly surprising really when it was a novel coronavirus that was particularly hard to spot,. Then when it was known the health care system in wuhan were on the brink of collapsing. Pretty hard to keep accurate numbers in that situation.

&gt;you dont mass build hospitals in days to deal with 90000 infected

No, you build them to isolate those infected, it is the quickest way of stopping community spread. And it worked well.

&gt;we had 450000 infected and 6000 deaths and we are very few hospitals.

Hence the massive ongoing community spread.

Try Ireland instead! Though it is a far smaller island, it still has a population similar to New Zealand's(roughly 5 mil each). And Ireland's main city, Dublin, has 1.1 million people in it, compared to Auckland's 1.4 million. According to wikipedia, the population of the top 3 NZ cities is just over 2 million(using 2018 census), while Ireland's top 3 cities clock in at just under 1.5 million(using a 2016 census). Sufficet to say, New Zealand has a denser urban population despite it being bigger, and multiple islands.

But I don't think being an island was the main factor that helped New Zealand. Rather, it was the fact that we got it slightly later than most other countries, because we're in a reasonably remote location, like you've mentioned. New Zealand was getting their very first cases around the same time as the virus was overloading hospitals in Italy. That gave us an opportunity. So it was easier for us because all our government had to do was not squander that. 

And they didn't. NZ looked at data from other countries, applied what they could to themselves, and learned from what they couldn't. And because they were able to do that and stamp COVID out successfully, they bought themselves time and resources to strengthen our border, testing, and contact tracing capabilities while other countries were using their time and resources to instead treat an honestly ghastly number of COVID patients.

That's why so many kiwis you've talked to are so confident in our government and abilities.

Because with the resources the government has put in place, hours after these 3 cases were confirmed, on top of the work and school places of the cases, we knew basically every place these people visited while contagious and symptomatic, down to the minute, and it's publicly available. https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-health-advice-public/contact-tracing-covid-19/covid-19-contact-tracing-locations-interest 

Today, they finished genome sequencing the positive cases, found out that it was the UK variant, cross referenced it with the cass currently in our MIQ facilities, and could not find a match.

I suggest, in other words, that rather than imitating the actions of vandals and delinquents, they behave like the law-abiding Christians they would like themselves to be seen as.

The people who are refusing to wear masks, coughing demonstratively when asked to put them on, come from largely Christian communities. Their ignorance of science, their denial of science, is no excuse. Whatever measures scientific evidence prescribes, they might want to ignore, but the words they attribute to their very own Lord require that they exceed even those, if it is a matter of care for one's fellow human: 

&gt;And unto him that smiteth thee on the *one* cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not *to take thy* coat also.

Luke 6:29

The very fact that the most behavior that is most abusive and disrespectful of others comes from the places that have the highest rates of fundamentalist Christianity is a damning (literally damning) evidence of how the religious institutions of the South and mid-West have failed in their pastoral duty. 

My Christian acquaintances fall on both sides of this behavioral divide. Some churches are at last in open conflict over the refusal to follow the word of the Lord, even as their ""pastors,"" who have steered them for decades to act like either a circus side-show or a pliant mob, fall silent or even worse, exhort inhumanity in the name of their power and their dollar. For all those on either side who just want everyone to go back to work so that the market can pick up again, here is another good line: you have to choose whether you will serve God, or money. 

For all those who praise the men and women who sacrificed something to protect them a few weeks ago, but who just refused to take any measures, in return, to protect those ""lowly folk"" from similar events in the future, consider Matthew 23:27:

Egypt owns the biggest gas field in the world, Leviathan.  They are waiting to export gas.

So, who in the area has or will very soon have a natural gas pipeline going to Cyprus and on to Greece????  Who?  The nation next door, Israel.

Palestine can join Israel and soon Egypt exporting natural gas to Western Europe, leaving Russia out in the freezing cold.  

And once that route is open, Arab countries can all export by pipeline, pennies on the dollar compared to LNG naval shipping.

Again, Palestine is never missing a chance to miss a chance.  Every Arab state interested in helping has either fully withdrawn or partially withdrawn.  There is a mental block on what's good in the real world.  So, Palestine begs for vaccine when it can fly a jet in to pick up what it needs and take every resident out for dinner for a year.   This is to me unethical on the part of their government, but let's never miss a chance to miss a chance.  Their older generation will die without an injection that will, not might, but will, save their lives.  

Worse, if Palestine doesn't act immediately, the rapidly spreading UK variant carries a virulence just now announced at 50% (40-70) higher, which means even more of their citizens of a broader age range, like from 40-45 to 100, will become infected, suffer more, and the same ratio of those infected will continue to die.

The world is in a medical emergency.  Palestine thinks the way to handle it is to ignore the financial reality, their powerful hammer, and beg, beg, beg.  Ouch.

We read about it, and I had a strong interest in viruses and epidemics and everything, and it scared me. (I said I was living near by at the time, but when I checked what year this actually was, it was just when I moved away. I was back for a visit). 

I'd gone with my parents to visit newcomers to the church who had just arrived from Hong Kong. It must have been Easter weekend. I remember being worried about having gone through Toronto, since it was so close, but I was not concerned at all about someone with SARS getting on the bus. I do remember thinking this family must be safe or they wouldn't have been let leave the airport coming from a hot spot. They were very nice, and the kid was cute. 

Kid also spiked a fever the next day. 

And we all found out that no, they really weren't screening or quarantining anyone coming from Hong Kong at the airport (sound familiar?), so the Chinese family had to go into quarantine and we were all put on notice we might have to too. 

Then there was a major power outage, so the whole neighbourhood got together to pass the time. We didn't go to church in our own neighbourhood, so none of these people had been exposed to the sick kid from Hong Kong. I do remember questioning the wisdom of this move if we were potentially going into quarantine, but I was the only one. 

In the end, the sick kid only had a regular cold, so it was fine. But there was no way we could have known that at the time. 

SARS was scary--absolutely terrifying at the time. It was the first time in my life we'd seen a respiratory virus like that. It spread incredibly fast, and was transmitted by doorknobs and fecal plumes, and killed frequently as well. Seeing our local doctors wearing hazmat suits like I'd only seen in documentaries about Ebola really didn't help. 

You asked if it was anything like now, and no, not in terms of restrictions, lock downs or masks. But the surrealness of it all at the beginning? Oh yes, very much so. The sense the world was sleepwalking into danger and I was in crazy land trying to prepare. I did think Canada would do much better than we did because of our SARS experience, but apparently we went very pants-on-head instead.

Your question indicates that you know no science of this virus.  

Virus evolves, always.  Read the headlines, UK, South Africa, Brazil, California, and plenty more.  And what does that mean, to evolve?  The virus is a series of RNA sequences; it's not living; it's matter that replicates randomly, influenced by its pretty much random environment.    The sequences carry markers that are history, like you carry some of what your ancestors, many generations before, carried.

So, looking at your genetic sequences, everyone will know a lot about you, scientifically.

This virus has a history.  The further back in time, one can see what the virus then matched up to at that time.  So, if it was a duck that was eaten that started this, that virus will show some sequences from a duck.  If it came from a top secret biochemical warfare lab, those unusual sequences would be present.  

Understanding what caused the transmission into a human being is critical to understanding what should be done, or topics that will be explored by scientific experts worldwide.  If it was from a duck, it is whatever the scientists can dream up to create early warning info, like testing randomly or all the ducks being eaten, maybe.  This is the world of virology and the allied fields.  If it were from the top secret lab, that's another issue.  That would be an explosive separate subject.  The virologists would look at how to identify and stop replication asap, before it blows up.

Which is another untargeted, blunt instrument that had to be used because there was insufficient existing unemployment support infrastructure.

Most developed countries have an unemployment system that, at least initially, pays a percentage of your most recent income. That way, if you suddenly get laid off, you don't immediately have to make drastic changes to your life and you have some time to find a new job.

But the fatigue? It just lingered, and lingered, and lingered. All through January I felt weak and tired beyond what a relatively healthy 27-year-old should. I couldn't eat. I wasn't throwing up, my body just physically revolted against getting more than a few bits of food down at time.

Zoonotic viral recombination can happen when different strains of the same virus infect the same host.

The recombination event results in a significant change in the genome of the virus, with very unpredictable results. One such possibility is that the new virus will retain its ability to infect the host animal (eg humans) but cause a severe immune response due to the parts of the viral proteins that were meant for the other animal (eg mink).

Viral recombinations like this is how we got the H1N1 pandemic (swine flu, from pigs), H5N1 pandemic (bird flu, from avians) and many other outbreaks of deadly infectious diseases.

Even worse, Viral recombination events for betacoronaviruses occur mostly in the spike protein, the target of our vaccines, and also a major factor in the virus’ severity.

If the mink-version of the virus infects a human with the human-version, and a viral recombination event occurs that shuffles its genome, we may see a new strain with increased severity that our existing vaccines will not work against.

This is why covid-infected minks are big news and many have been culled since we knew they could be infected months ago.

If you just want to test whether people get sick, you get them to pay attention to their symptoms, report if they feel ill, come in for treatment, etc. You count up who got sick in the placebo and the vaccine groups and voila, you're done. That's what the clinical trials did, basically.

But to test whether people are less contagious, you have to figure out whether they're getting people sick. How do you do that?

Well, one thing you can do is measure their viral load, and a lot of these studies are actually doing that and **assuming** that lower viral loads means less contagiousness. It's a reasonable assumption, but it's not nearly as direct of a measure as the headlines like ""Vaccine reduces spread risk"" might suggest. The twitter thread you pointed to also makes these assumption jumps: they string together a measure of viral load reduction, and combine it with an estimate of contagiousness as a function of viral load.

They'll also test whether people are getting sick asymptomatically, which is a good test of a reasonable alternative hypothesis (that the vaccine is just making people asymptomatic but still capable of spreading). This is much closer to a real test of transmission risk in my view, but it's still not quite ideal because it won't tell you directly if the vaccinated asymptomatic carriers have a lower probability of passing it to others than they would have without the vaccine.

**So TL;DR people should understand that estimating transmission effects of vaccines is going to require lots of pieces of indirect evidence** that might be harder for the general public to understand. It's much closer to a proper ""scientific theory"" in the sense that it's built upon many interlocking pieces, whereas the efficacy of vaccines at stopping disease is a much more empirically straightforward question (""What percentage of people got it?"").",,,1613415306,{},gnk7rez,False,t3_lk8xjt,False,True,t1_gnjxumy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lk8xjt/daily_discussion_thread_february_15_2021/gnk7rez/,1613415675,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_992ply7u,False,False,,

There are plenty of cultures where people keep their faces covered at all times (such as Middle Eastern countries or countries with high levels of pollution), for their whole lives, and children have no problems recognizing faces. Working with children during this pandemic, I've actually been impressed at how I can smile through my mask at a 7month old baby, and she'll smile right back at me. As long as kids are still seeing the faces of their parents, grandparents, etc, they're still getting plenty of exposure to recognizing faces. 

&gt; They're a huge environmental issue given that most people are wearing disposable ones.

Walk around literally anywhere besides a hospital. I just came out of Target. Literally 90% of the people were wearing cloth masks. I wouldn't be surprised if we are actually using *fewer* masks in the hospital. When I rounded at this time last year, I would go through 10 masks in a morning. Now, I get one for the whole day. 


&gt; Their effectiveness, while not zero, is probably a lot less than advertised. 

The ""advertisements"" are rigorous, peer reviewed scientific studies, so I'm not sure what can be said to change the minds of people believing this. In our viral clinic, where we diagnose dozens of COVID patients in one week, there has not been a single person that got infected from March through now. All that we've been doing is wearing face shields and N95s. Initially, we didn't even have N95s, so we were just wearing goggles/face shields with cloth masks. 

&gt; They cause needless divisiveness and serve as more of a tribal totem than a medical precaution.

They're only divisive if you distrust the data saying that they *work.* They are clearly a medical precaution, as we are wearing them 100% of the time in the hospital. They only cause ""needless divisiveness"" and are a ""tribal totem"" if you're a denialist that chooses to ignore the dozens of studies that support their efficacy. Do mask *mandates* work? That's a more nuanced question, because people are still gathering privately and not wearing masks, leading to spread of the virus. If you have an Instagram account, looking at the stories will show you a good picture of that in under 5 minutes.

And the short term lock downs, no more than a fee months for the most extreme case, allow us to be out and about and fully operational. If the US, one of the richest countries in the world can afford billions in corporate tax breaks then surely they can afford to keep people home for a few months at a time. Do what we did- pay anyone out of work 2k a month, and pay businesses that are down on revenue 3k per month per employee they keep on the books even if those employees are currently given 0 hours (with the caveat of that employee gets the money- the business cannot pocket it).

By Carl Zimmer Feb. 14, 2021 Updated 1:45 p.m. ET As Americans anxiously watch variants first identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa spread in the United States, scientists are finding a number of new variants that originated here. More concerning, many of these variants seem to be evolving in the same direction — potentially becoming contagious threats of their own.

In a study posted on Sunday, a team of researchers reported seven growing lineages of the novel coronavirus, spotted in states across the country. All of them have evolved a mutation in the same genetic letter.

“There’s clearly something going on with this mutation,” said Jeremy Kamil, a virologist at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport and a co-author of the new study.

It’s unclear whether it makes the variants more contagious. But because the mutation appears in a gene that influences how the virus enters human cells, the scientists are highly suspicious.

“I think there’s a clear signature of an evolutionary benefit,” Dr. Kamil said.

The history of life is full of examples of so-called convergent evolution, in which different lineages follow the same path. Birds gained wings as they evolved from feathered dinosaurs, for example, just as bats did when they evolved from furry, shrew-like mammals. In both cases, natural selection gave rise to a pair of flat surfaces that could be flapped to generate lift — enabling bats and birds alike to take to the sky and fill an ecological niche that other animals could not.

Charles Darwin first recognized convergent evolution by studying living animals. In recent years, virologists have found that viruses can evolve convergently, too. H.I.V., for example, arose when several species of viruses shifted from monkeys and apes to humans. Many of those lineages of H.I.V. gained the same mutations as they adapted to our species.

As the coronavirus now branches into new variants, researchers are observing Darwin’s theory of evolution in action, day in and day out.

Dr. Kamil stumbled across some of the new variants while he was sequencing samples from coronavirus tests in Louisiana. At the end of January, he observed an unfamiliar mutation in a number of samples.

The mutation altered the proteins that stud the surface of the coronavirus. Known as spike proteins, they are folded chains of more than 1,200 molecular building blocks called amino acids. Dr. Kamil’s viruses all shared a mutation that changed the 677th amino acid.

Investigating these mutant viruses, Dr. Kamil realized they all belonged to the same lineage. The earliest virus in the lineage dated back to Dec. 1. In later weeks, it grew more common.

On the evening of his discovery, Dr. Kamil uploaded the genomes of the viruses to an online database used by scientists across the world. The next morning, he got an email from Daryl Domman of the University of New Mexico. He and his colleagues had just found the same variant in their state, with the same 677 mutation. Their samples dated back to October.

The scientists wondered whether the lineage they had discovered was the only one to have a 677 mutation. Probing the database, Dr. Kamil and his colleagues found six other lineages that independently gained the same mutation on their own.

It’s difficult to answer even basic questions about the prevalence of these seven lineages because the United States sequences genomes from less than 1 percent of coronavirus test samples. The researchers found samples from the lineages scattered across much of the country. But they can’t tell where the mutations first arose.

“I’d be quite hesitant to give an origin location for any of these lineages at the moment,” said Emma Hodcroft, an epidemiologist at the University of Bern and a co-author of the new study.

It’s also hard to say whether the increase in variants is actually the result of their being more contagious. They might have become more common simply because of all of the travel over the holiday season. Or they might have exploded during superspreader events at bars or factories.

Still, scientists are worried because the mutation could plausibly affect how easily the virus gets into human cells.

An infection begins when a coronavirus uses the tip of the spike protein to latch onto the surface of a human cell. It then unleashes harpoon-like arms from the spike’s base, pulling itself to the cell and delivering its genes.

Before the virus can carry out this invasion, however, the spike protein has to bump into a human protein on the surface of the cell. After that contact, the spike becomes free to twist, exposing its harpoon tips.

The 677 mutation alters the spike protein next to the spot where our proteins nick the virus, conceivably making it easier for the spike to be activated.

Jason McLellan, a structural biologist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved in the study, called it “an important advance.” But he cautioned that the way that the coronavirus unleashed its harpoons was still fairly mysterious.

“It’s tough to know what these substitutions are doing,” he said. “It really needs to be followed up with some additional experimental data.”

Dr. Kamil and his colleagues are starting those experiments, hoping to see whether the mutation does indeed make a difference to infections. If the experiments bear out their suspicions, the 677 mutation will join a small, dangerous club.

Convergent evolution has transformed a few other spots on the spike protein as well. The 501st amino acid has mutated in a number of lineages, for example, including the contagious variants first observed in the United Kingdom and South Africa. Experiments have revealed that the 501 mutation alters the very tip of the spike. That change allows the virus to latch onto cells more tightly, and infect them more effectively.

Scientists anticipate that coronaviruses will converge on more mutations that give them an advantage — against not only other viruses but also our own immune system. But Vaughn Cooper, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Pittsburgh and a co-author of the new study, said lab experiments alone wouldn’t be able to reveal the extent of the threat.

To really understand what the mutations are doing, he said, scientists will need to analyze a much bigger sampling of coronaviruses gathered from across the country. But right now, they can look at only a relatively meager number of genomes collected by a patchwork of state and university labs.

“It’s ridiculous that our country is not coming up with a national strategy for doing surveillance,” Dr. Cooper said.

Passivity for whatever political structural reason is unhelpful.  The information got identified every time one of the very sick showed up at a hospital.  This is China of the 21st Century.  This is not local hut medicine.  The pathology lab, at least in the US, collects and analyzes samples.  So did China's.  It would be absurd to say that in a town of what, 50 million, there is not first rate medical technology and routines?

And that's irrespective of China's prior idea that wet markets were fun and historical, and esoteric and delicious.  China gambled and lost.  Who cares.  The question is where are the samples.  The China answer is ""What samples?""  China needs to fire or retrain its virology leadership.  

Showing China for what it is, and how it is acting is the first step.  They  can't suppress virological truth.  They know this is not a game to get them.  They know they are unwilling to ""get real"".  

No rational scientist throws there hands up and says, ""We're all done looking and we're not doing any more.""  This attitude that seems like masked fear is their Achilles heel.  

Something happened  and the virus started replicating in humans,  China claims it has no idea what that was.  It was perfectly ok that China was in the dark at the inception.  But they are not stupid.  What reason can there be, that's intellectually defensible that there is nowhere else to look?  It has been ignorance and fear at the inception, the nail getting hit.  But that's gone.  

There will be another virological event leading to an epidemic gone wild, as that's what they do in the real world.  China did well for its people at a huge price.  But that's not the point, either.  The exercise here is to use this unique time to find case #1, or 2, apparently WHO thinks there is value in that discovery.

Everyone wants all the info on the table.  On the other hand, China's science is framed by its Party rules.  Look to the WHO experts, not the general statements from the top.  Listen to what they searched for and what response they got.  Do it objectively.

I find every other country's effort profoundly unimpressive. Obviously Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Seychelles are doing an excellent job, but they have much smaller populations over a much smaller area. That's not to say it isn't impressive, countries like Luxembourg or Singapore should be in league with them, but I just don't consider most countries comparable to the United States in this regard.

I think that for countries you can compare to the United States, you could talk about Canada, China, the United Kingdom, Japan, Russia, India, Australia, and probably a few others that just aren't coming to me right now. Some people might count the European Union as a whole. I personally feel the United States is doing an incredible job, not just with distribution but with their actual vaccines. The mRNA based vaccines are both American owned, with Moderna's being developed here, and they've both proven to be the most resistant to the variants.

I've often compared the distribution of these vaccines to a moon landing level achievement, but I think the entire pandemic is a little comparable to the space race. The United States didn't get the first object in orbit or the first man in space, but we landed on the moon first. Similarly, the United States didn't handle the early stages of the pandemic well- Even if we could debate what ""well"" would look like all day- but it's looking like we'll be crossing the finish line a lot sooner than the rest.

It undermines trust people have in their public health institutions when people suspect the biggest reason covid is dropping is because many people in their regular circle of contacts have some level of acquired immunity and the experts say it's because of masks and social distancing (i.e. Because of our advice).

People look around and what they're doing now is no different than what they were doing in October and November and December. And the collapse in New cases and deaths occurred despite many, if not most, people seeing family for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Not exactly what I’d call a damning link. For Marion Koopmans, it seems she has been an adviser for the Guangdong CDC since 2007 based on information on her LinkedIn, however to what degree of involvement she had is pretty unclear.

Any answer you get that is either ""yes"" or ""no"" is wrong, for now. We have only ""maybe, probably not"", and it's going to be that way for a long time.

In order to answer the question scientifically, it would require a ""challenge study"" where both vaccinated and unvaccinated people are deliberately exposed to the virus to see if transmission occurs.

The ethical concerns of deliberate exposure prevent us from performing these studies in humans.  It's the same reason that the vaccine trials took so long, we can't deliberately infect people to see if they need hospitalization or die.

However, we did these studies in hamsters, and the results looked pretty bad. They were able to spread it. But hamsters greet each other by touching noses like all the time. Humans don't really do that (do you?). So we did similar studies with monkeys and the results look really good.

Also, you'll notice that any reputable person talking about this subject always says ""may be able to spread"", or ""maybe"", or ""we don't know if"". And that's because there is a small chance that vaccinated people will be able to spread the virus. But it's not a big chance. Doctors, scientists, and regulators are being very careful with their language on this subject, some would argue they're being too careful. That said, if they were to say that ""vaccinated people cannot spread the virus"", and then we find out that in some situations that vaccinated people have spread the virus, that would end up worse for them than if they hedge for a while. So at least to me, the way they're framing it seems pretty reasonable, you just have to put yourself in their shoes.

[Yay!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmqfk4q/)

Just because [mRNA vaccines aren't 100% effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/)  against the SA variant, *doesn't* [mean that we'll definitely need boosters](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gmu581s/).

**Spike mutation analogy:**

The spike protein is coded by 3,831 base pairs.  What does that mean?

Well, it's like a lego sculpture where you have 3,831 words in the instructions for how to build it, and the writer had to be super-detailed when explaining each motion and piece.    

In this analogy, your immune system makes lego pieces (antibodies) that can attach to any pair of exposed bumps on the lego sculpture.  We'll say there are 40 pairs exposed in this example.

A variant is when the instructions change by just one or more words.  Sometimes the photocopier for the instructions page gets a tiny smudge.  This could be really bad sometimes, especially if it's a critical word or phrase, like ""left"" or ""repeat six times"" or a description of a particularly detailed lego piece. Color might not always matter, but size would.

Out of those 3,831 words, how many have to change so much that every one of those 40 spots is no longer there?  It's probably a lot.

But wait, how many words have to change to make the whole sculpture really different, so that it doesn't work as a sculpture anymore?  Really not that many if they're in the right spots, right?  This is why most variants suck at being viruses; it's rare that a mistake would make the instructions *better*.

**Which vaccine should I get?**

When someone asks me what my favorite beer is, the answer is always the same.

It's the one in front of me.

So get the first vaccine you can, the differences are pretty minor.

**Booster questions to think about, I don't have answers**

(note: there's a difference between ""boost"" and ""booster"" here that needs to be understood.)

(also, what's the term for a mixture of sequences, heterogenous? Is my doubt about this term just from overthinking?)

(also also, I'm not convinced we're definitely going to need boosters, this is just fun to think about.)

Could a booster shot replace the second dose of a prime/boost regimen?

Should a booster shot use only one sequence of mRNA (or have all identical spike proteins), or should it have both/multiple?

For future vaccines, should the sequence/spike be the same for prime/boost or different?  If you have four spikes/sequences, would it make more sense to do two in each, or all four in each?

How much should we trust mutation modeling here? Should we anticipate future mutations and include them?  Are we good enough at that yet?

Do we need to give any non-booster doses to people who have recovered from infection?

Could we ""stretch"" doses of an mRNA booster by priming with a vaccine that's easier to manufacture, but maybe less effective (like ChAdOx1), and boost with the mRNA booster?  Could it be better or faster to prime with a current mRNA sequence and boost with an updated ChAdOx1?  

[**Conclusions**](https://gfycat.com/cleantalkativedassie)

Okay, so the vaccines reduce infections, and if someone gets an infection after getting vaccinated, they have fewer and reduced symptoms.  This currently seems to also be true with post vaccination infection with any of the known variants. We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with mild symptoms spread only slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well. 

In other words: A reduction in symptoms is at least correlated with a reduction in the ability to spread the virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections and symptoms in those who do get infected. Therefore, vaccines should reduce spread.

If people develop immunity via clearing an infection, each subsequent variant they are exposed to will just broaden their immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). So they'll have good and broad immunity to a variety of variants, which seems likely to be an indication that they won't catch or spread the virus as well in the future. Same thing happens when someone who is vaccinated is exposed to a new variant. Their immunity is broadened and strengthened by each subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. But remember, so many people will be less likely to spread the virus, so it's pretty unlikely that this reduced level of spread will be sufficient to sustain the virus in the way we have seen over the past year. So if a variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. If they don't become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing to have my mind changed on this with new information though, so don't take this as gospel. (Just don't be a gigantic asshole about it, please.  I've had to block one person.)

Should we be excited about a vaccine that's not 90%+ effective like Moderna? Excellent question! [Absolutely, yes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/l7mzvn/daily_discussion_thread_january_29_2021/gl8iyj5?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) 

They [work so well](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/l7apag/just_004_of_israelis_caught_covid19_after_two/) and are so super safe that super smart super rich [people are paying to cut in line](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kzbsfk/some_wealthy_americans_accused_of_getting/) to get them. If it wasn't safe and [effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/li9jg8/it_works_0_deaths_only_4_severe_cases_among/), they wouldn't be paying thousands for shots.

There’s no such thing as [vaccine side effects that take months or years to show up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k96ng0/how_is_it_possible_to_create_a_safe_and_effective/gfldup9/) If there is a side effect, [it shows up right away.](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2017/0615/p786.html)  Thousands of phase 2 trial participants have had the vaccine for over 6 months, and there are no worrying, lingering, or [delayed side effects.](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/covid-19-vaccine-myths-debunked)

Do the vaccines work against variants? [Yes, probably better than you were expecting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l685dy/vaccination_against_the_new_variants_realworld/) At least the mRNA vaccines [*still* work](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfp89k/neutralization_of_sarscov2_spike_6970_deletion/) on the three most worrying variants.

[This was encouraging,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmp5doo/) regarding the efficacy of vaccines against variants.

The currently approved vaccines (Pfizer/Moderna) work against [all the new variants.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kqz7y5/comprehensive_mapping_of_mutations_to_the/)  Even that [new one](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l15czh/neutralization_of_sarscov2_lineage_b117/) you just read about.  [Seriously,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4pnde/mrna1273_vaccine_induces_neutralizing_antibodies/) it's [very probably](https://reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l6vs1t/in_vitro_studies_demonstrate_pfizer_and/), like, [not going to be a problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l0yqe6/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gjwov3s?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) Yes, even the SA variant, [which might not be a concern at all.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kxkrb9/endemic_sarscov2_will_maintain_postpandemic/) The more vaccines we test, the more we find that they still [work against the variants](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lax5wa/neutralization_of_sarscov2_voc_501yv2_by_human/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), at least enough to be totally worthwhile. ChAdOx1 (Oxford/Astrazeneca) may not be so great against the SA variant.  Pfizer [seems fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lf7uph/neutralization_of_viruses_with_european_south/) against the troubling variants, at least in the lab.

Still worried about variants? Check [this out!](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/01/27/vaccination-against-the-new-variants-real-world-data) *

Most variants aren't great at being viruses.  [Some, including the mink variant have already gone extinct](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/19/danish-covid-mink-variant-very-likely-extinct-but-controversial-cull-continues).

Vaccine induced immunity is [comparable to](https://www.verywellhealth.com/antibodies-from-vaccines-and-from-natural-infection-5092564), or [better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l5whhu/increased_resistance_of_sarscov2_variants_b1351/) immunity from a previous infection. Especially [variants of concern.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgxpre/vaccineinduced_immunity_provides_more_robust/)

Post infection immunity lasts [*at least 8 months*](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/koxkm1/sarscov2_infection_induces_longlived_bone_marrow/), though [probably a lot longer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/klpvp7/sarscov2specific_t_cell_memory_is_longlasting_in/)  Again, [*at least* 8 months, though you may not even really need very many antibodies,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ldj06f/immunological_memory_to_sarscov2_assessed_for_up/) since other types of immunity seem to be more important.  It's too soon to say ""lifelong"" but [that is a possibility.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4nkco/the_immune_system_mounts_a_lasting_defense_after/) Also, it looks like those who have recovered *may* only need [one dose of an mRNA vaccine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/labst4/robust_spike_antibody_responses_and_increased/). There are some people (~7%) who don't develop lasting immunity from infections. 

Immunity from the vaccine [lasts *at least 6 months*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l9nfu8/stable_neutralizing_antibody_levels_six_months/) probably a lot,[ lot longer,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6a6pq/durability_of_responses_after_sarscov2_mrna1273/)  probably many years. 

The OG SARS virus from 2003 gave detectable immunity [both 6](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/12/7264) and [12 years later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kvbz9y/weekly_question_thread/gizs32j/)   

Covid19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, OG SARS was caused by SARS-CoV. Looks like both came from bats.  [They’re 79% the same.](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930251-8) (PDF)

Antibodies from recovered people who then got an mRNA vaccine [work on variants *and* OG SARS?!](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfiypu/antibodies_elicited_by_sarscov2_infection_and/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) 

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) * article does a good job of explaining the likelihood of vaccines *at least* reducing spread.  [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lf744r/daily_discussion_thread_february_08_2021/gml0gyi/) may help if that article is too much.

Milder cases, especially asymptomatic cases [are worse at spreading](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kcy2e0/weekly_question_thread_week_of_december_14/gg8tp7n/).  

[Pfizer's vaccine may prevent spread](https://news.yahoo.com/israeli-study-suggests-pfizer-covid-143104894.html) and disease. [Wow!](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/coronavirus/1611598602-israel-less-than-0-01-of-second-vaccine-dose-recipients-contract-covid-19) Looks like the amount of virus in people who've gotten one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and then infected is [greatly reduced compared to those not vaccinated](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfiqma/decreased_sarscov2_viral_load_following/).  This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a heavy reduction in ability to spread the virus.

NYT has [some good news!](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/briefing/donald-trump-pardon-phil-spector-coronavirus-deaths.html?action=click&amp;module=Briefings&amp;pgtype=Homepage) In fact, [they have a lot.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/la11xg/all_five_vaccines_with_public_results_have/) *

Reinfections are rare, some studies show [less than 1 in 1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kyj0bx/sarscov2_reinfection_in_a_cohort_of_43000/) (maybe in the 1 in 10,000 range).  Reinfections tend to be much milder than previous infections, even those new variants. 

Multiple [studies using monkeys](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03041-6) show strong immunity, or [sterilizing immunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/la4fud/immunogenic_bnt162b_vaccines_protect_rhesus/) from multiple vaccine types.  It's unlikely that sterilizing immunity would be found in 100% of vaccinated humans, if we even get sterilizing immunity at all. This is still good news.

Then in section A it discriminates where in the UK, among other facilities in FR/BE/ITL/DE.

&gt;Bottom line is that if AZ were in breach of contract, they'd be sued, and that isn't happening. The EU know they'd lose.

This is not out of the realm of possibility, the EU just won't do it at the moment, since it would be counter productive, and suddenly production yields improved after the contract came to public lol - interesting no?

Bottom line is this: vaccine nationalism is alive and well, USA and UK have export bans in place and they're not allowing private companies to manage their production and fulfill their contracts with other countries.

A permanent resident who returned from India is among the nine imported cases, as are a dependant's pass holder and a work pass holder who arrived from the United Arab Emirates.

Two imported cases are work permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh and Indonesia, one of whom is a domestic worker.

The remaining four infections are short-term visit pass holders. Three of them arrived from India and Nigeria to visit family members who are Singaporeans or permanent residents, while the other case arrived from Indonesia for a job placement.

They were tested while serving their stay-home notice.

MOH said 20 more COVID-19 cases have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. A total of 59,641 have fully recovered from the infection.

There are 36 COVID-19 patients still in hospital, most of whom are stable or improving, with one person in a critical condition in the intensive care unit.

It is probably a little early for vaccinations to be affecting cases because the vaccinations are among the elderly who generally have lower cases and higher illness. Or, you could say that health care and other essential workers have been contributing to the spread and now that they are immune or vaccinated that is stopping.

I was very active in china_flu subreddit (when that was the main Coronavirus sub) back in December/January last year. I remember watching things unfold like a slow-moving train wreck. We all saw China mandating masks, and taking an extremely aggressive approach against the virus. We all assumed we'd be doing the same here....may of us started buying our own supplies. 

I, along with everyone else in the sub, was totally horrified when Fauci and the CDC flat out said people should not be wearing masks.  They knew it was a respiratory infection already, and they also knew from SARS that masks were effective.

The entire argument that he was protecting supply for healthcare workers is bs. Most hospitals were using entirely separate supply chains. I tried donating my masks early on and nobody would even accept them at first unless they came from approved medical vendors.

KF94s are very comfortable, so spend $30 on a pack of those for the next few months.

Our choices are basically do nothing and have a lot of death, put masks on and keep almost everything open with some death, or lock everyone down to completely minimize death. All three options have some sort of economic or emotional cost, and I think most people would agree that masks is the least damaging of those.

The group that wants no mitigation at all seems to feel that the economy will rebound to 100% even with death and the virus all around us.

For now we have only the sequence used by the Pfizer vaccine, here's what it codes for in order ([full breakdown](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/)):

* The CAP to make sure the RNA looks like regular mRNA
* A known successful and optimized 5’ untranslated region (UTR)
* A codon optimized signal peptide to send the Spike protein to the right place (amino acids copied 100% from the original virus)
* A codon optimized version of the original spike, with two ‘Proline’ substitutions to make sure the protein appears in the right form
* A known successful and optimized 3’ untranslated region
* A poly-A tail with a ‘linker’ in there

So there's room for changes. The [next post](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/genetic-code-of-covid-19-vaccines/) notes:

&gt;Both the Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer vaccines use such modified mRNA, although I think they don’t use the exact same modification. But in many ways, the Moderna and BioNTech vaccines are very alike. Sadly Moderna has not published the RNA sequence of its vaccine, so we can’t compare directly.

In practise, we see [the following](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-vaccines-transmission/fact-check-covid-19-vaccines-have-been-found-to-prevent-death-more-data-needed-on-whether-and-to-what-extent-they-prevent-transmission-idUSKBN2A92YL):

&gt;For Pfizer/BioNTech, efficacy is said to reach 95%, while Moderna reaches 94.1% ([here](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine), [here](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-primary-efficacy-analysis-phase-3-cove-study)). Both AstraZeneca and Moderna have also reported a 100% rate of protection against severe effects of COVID-19. Pfizer, meanwhile, said 10 severe cases of COVID-19 were reported in its phase III trial – nine of which were in the placebo group; one in the vaccine group.

The effectiveness after 2 doses against symptomatic COVID-19 is pretty much the same, and the sample is too small to confidently say if there really is a difference regarding severe COVID-19. However, Moderna's vaccine [seems](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210114-covid-19-how-effective-is-a-single-vaccine-dose) significantly more effective after one dose (80.2% vs 52%), and its higher dosing could be responsible as well.

All in all, I wouldn't expect a difference of more than a few percentage points in effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19, but perhaps there is a wider one against severe COVID-19 (and in other factors like duration of protection, but we need several more months of data to say).",,,1613348057,{},gnhcz7q,False,t3_ljsjys,False,True,t1_gngqvf3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ljsjys/analysis_of_12_million_israelis_half_vaccinated/gnhcz7q/,1613355383,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_lk40y,False,False,,

I have assumed that this new variant B.1.1.7 grows and operates totally independent of the original strain, that it is not helped to spread by the earlier versions. (or is it the Virus (1.0) that is already here is mutating through cross exposure? Is 2.0 The Borg and once 2.0 and 1.0 mingle, there is no longer a separate path for 1.0)

When I look back, there are very few things that we were doing in late January through March/April  2020 to slow the spread, including widespread wearing of mask. 

“I have assumed” that lack of defensive measures allowed Covid 1.0 to grab a foothold in a handful places across America, and from there spread regionally at it’s own pace.

Now it seems to be clear that it is not just that we were unprepared in early 2020.

1.0 was always going to be spreading to every state regardless of what we did, from where it would soon branch out to hundreds of hotspots across each State.

By March 2021, the CDC predicts COVID  B.1.1.7  (or 2.0) will become the dominant strand in America. Meaning even when fully prepared, we failed just as miserably stopping 2.0 spreading across America as we did 1.0.

COVID 2.0 is believed to have hit the US in late November. A time of 90% cutback in sporting events, church meetings, in office working reduction, significantly reduced air travel, reduced in restaurant dinning, limited school attendance , gym attendance. concerts, conventions, etc...etc....All has meant little as far as preventing COVID 2.0 from quickly developing a national footprint. 

I know our precautions have prevented larger case, hospitalizations and death numbers. But it seems to have had little effect on stopping geographic spread.

It's simple. It's becoming increasingly clear that the vast, vast majority of people who got covid-19 at some point over the past 11 months are now practically immune to reinfection, and they will most likely remain immune for a long time. I would *very* conservatively estimate that *at least* 90% (but almost certainly higher) of people who got covid-19 have some form of lasting immunity.

This does not mean that reinfections don't happen. But reinfections are rare, and almost certainly something we should not worry about. Not from a personal perspective, and also not from a herd immunity perspective. Not too sound too obvious, but if reinfection has, say, a 5% percent chance of happening, it will happen 1 in 20 times, and it is then not unrealistic that many people will personally know someone who got re-infected (note: I suspect the chance of reinfection is much lower than that, but I used 5% because it's easy to visualize). 

The answer to the question of reinfection is not binary. It's not ""even if you had covid-19 you are still not going to be immune"", nor ""everyone who had it is immune"". The answer is more like ""almost all people who had it are immune"" (which is close, but not quite the same as ""everyone who had it is immune""; there is definitely a significant difference between those two).

In other words: this virus behaves like most viruses we know of. It would be a breath of fresh air if people stopped pretending it's from an ""alien planet"", so to speak, and has extraordinary properties compared to other viruses.

Look, most people are terrible at numbers; especially percentages, large numbers, exponential growth, and so on. This pandemic has made that painfully clear once again. I understand that people see news items about reinfections and get the impression that this is something they, personally, should worry about, or that this is a huge problem in general. But it is almost certainly not. If reinfection was something that happened to a significant minority (say, 20-30% of people), we would know by now.",,,1613346997,{},gnhb489,False,t3_ljmbdo,False,True,t1_gngo6gc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ljmbdo/israeli_study_indicates_postcovid_immunity_stays/gnhb489/,1613354517,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_81s54kqb,False,False,,

The kingdom of under six million people has become one of the most efficient vaccination distributors in Europe and aims to have offered its whole population a jab by June.

But before that target is reached, there's pressure for life to get back to normal for Danes already inoculated and to open up borders for Covid-immune travelers from overseas.

Morten Bødskov, Denmark's acting finance minister, last week raised the prospect of a so-called coronavirus passport being introduced by the end of the month.

""Denmark is still hard hit by the corona pandemic,"" he said. ""But there are parts of Danish society that need to move forward, and a business community that needs to be able to travel.""

The government has since indicated that a February deadline might be ambitious, but the relatively small Scandinavian country could still become the world's first to formally embrace the technology to open its borders in this controversial way.",,,1613356523,{},gnhrtu5,True,t3_lk3nti,False,True,t3_lk3nti,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lk3nti/could_covid_passports_deliver_a_summer_of_joy/gnhrtu5/,1613362237,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_9ayyzh09,False,False,,

“As Americans anxiously watch the spread of coronavirus variants that were first identified in Britain and South Africa, scientists are finding a number of new variants that seem to have originated in the United States — and many of them may pose the same kind of extra-contagious threat.

In a study posted on Sunday, a team of researchers reported seven growing lineages of the coronavirus, spotted in states across the country. All have gained a mutation at the exact same spot in their genes.

“There’s clearly something going on with this mutation,” said Jeremy Kamil, a virologist at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center and a co-author of the new study.

It’s not clear yet whether this shared mutation makes the variants more contagious, but because it appears in a gene that influences how the virus enters human cells, the scientists are highly suspicious.

“I think there’s a clear signature of an evolutionary benefit,” Dr. Kamil said.

It’s not unusual for different genetic lineages to independently evolve in the same direction. Charles Darwin recognized convergent evolution in animals. Virologists have found that it happens with viruses, too. As the coronavirus branches into new variants, researchers are observing Darwin’s theory of evolution in action every day.

It’s difficult to answer even basic questions about how prevalent the new variants are in the United States because the country sequences genomes from less than 1 percent of coronavirus test samples. The researchers found examples scattered across much of the country, but they can’t tell where they first arose.

It’s also hard to say whether the variants are spreading now because they are more contagious, or for some other reason, like holiday travel or superspreader events.

Scientists say the mutation could plausibly affect how easily the virus gets into human cells. But Jason McLellan, a structural biologist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved in the study, cautioned that the way that the coronavirus unleashes its harpoons was still fairly mysterious.

“It’s tough to know what these substitutions are doing,” he said of the mutations. “It really needs to be followed up with some additional experimental data.”",,,1613356296,{},gnhrelp,False,t3_lk1jiz,False,False,t3_lk1jiz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lk1jiz/a_new_study_identifies_seven_us_virus_variants/gnhrelp/,1613362048,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_44bjj64k,False,False,,

&gt;A “first doses first” approach — that is, prioritizing first doses by delaying the second shot from three to four weeks (the period studied in clinical trials) to 12 weeks — would allow more people to get vaccinated quickly, for example. “Fractional” dosing, such as by giving half-doses, would instantly increase the vaccine supply and has been used successfully in previous epidemics. And, of course, we should authorize more vaccines, including Johnson &amp; Johnson’s and AstraZeneca’s (despite one disappointing trial for the latter in South Africa), and the Novavax vaccine. We should take a closer look at Sputnik, the Russian formula, now that it has shown strong results in clinical trials. Finally, to get shots into arms we could ease up on prioritization rules, to streamline the process.

&gt; A new phase II study from Moderna shows that half-doses (50 μg) appear to be as good as full doses (100 ug) at generating correlates of protection such as neutralizing antibodies.

Excerpt from the paper:

&gt; In this randomized, controlled phase 2 trial, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate mRNA-1273, administered as a two-dose vaccination regimen at 50 and 100 μg, exhibited robust immune responses and an acceptable safety profile in healthy adults aged 18 years and older. Local and systemic adverse reactions were mostly mild-to-moderate in severity, were ≤4 days of median duration and were less commonly reported in older compared with younger adults. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike binding and neutralizing antibodies were induced by both doses of mRNA-1273 within 28 days after the first vaccination, and rose substantially to peak titers by 14 days after the second vaccination, exceeding levels of convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients. The antibodies remained elevated through the last time point assessed at 57 days. Neutralizing responses met criteria for seroconversion within 28 days after the first vaccination in the majority of participants, with rates of 100% observed at 14 and 28 days after the second vaccination. While no formal statistical testing was done, binding and neutralizing antibody responses were generally comparable in participants who received the 100 μg mRNA-1273 and the 50 μg dose at all time points and across both age groups. Overall, the results of this randomized, placebo-controlled trial extend previous immunogenicity and safety results for mRNA-1273 in the phase 1 study in an expanded cohort including participants older than 55 years of age [16, 19].

Vitamin C reduced time to a 50% reduction in symptoms by approximately one day.  

""Patients who received usual care without supplementation achieved a 50% reduction in symptoms at a mean (SD) of 6.7 (4.4) days compared with 5.5 (3.7) days for the ascorbic acid group...""

I was surprised to see the very generous dose of vitamin C; however, my understanding is that we will absorb a higher percentage of the dose when the dose is smaller, such as 1000mg or less.  

""8000 mg of ascorbic acid (to be divided over 2-3 times per day with meals), (2) 50 mg of zinc gluconate at bedtime""

Regarding zinc the study authors wrote, 

"" In addition, studies on SARS, a coronavirus, have shown that zinc can inhibit its ribonucleic acid polymerase.[11](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2776305#zoi210024r11) However, the biologic activity of zinc against viruses may require ionophores, such as pyrithione, to block viral replication.[13](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2776305#zoi210024r13) ""

My understanding is that the RNA polymerase is needed by the virus to replicate, but zinc inhibits it.  However you need to get higher than normal amounts of zinc into cells.  This requires a substance called a ""zinc ionophore.""

There is some lab data from a few years ago suggesting that the supplements quercetin and EGCG from green tea are zinc ionophores.  reference available if requested

In [this clip](https://youtu.be/xy8XcBodQv0?t=704) a chief of emergency med at a med school hospital mentions a successful study of quercetin plus vitamin C for prevention in health care workers.  Elsewhere he mentioned that vitamin C protects quercetin, I think from oxidation. 

The best known zinc ionophore during the pandemic has been hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).   It is thought to be more effective as an ionophore than quercetin and EGCG. 

The most impressive studies of HCQ I've come across also included zinc.  

[The Zelenko study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920304258) of HCQ, Zinc and antibiotic in high-risk outpatients reported a more than 75% reduction in hospitalization in comparison to another doctor in his community in the NYC area.  

[The Carlucci study](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jmm/10.1099/jmm.0.001250) of Zinc plus HCQ and antibiotic in hospitalized patients at NYU reported a roughly 50% reduction in deaths in the group that received zinc in addition to HCQ and AZT given to both groups.

JnJ was 72 percent effective in the US, but their definition of mild disease was \*only\* one symptom + positive PCR. Moderate was 2 symptoms + positive PCR (so if you had a headache and fever, that would automatically make you a moderate case, despite the fact that most of us would consider that still mild).

I would take JnJ now vs Moderna or Pfizer a month from now, no question, given that they \*all\* prevented severe disease and hospitalizations in trials. I can get boosted later anyways. I don't really care that much about getting a truly mild case.  


Of course, this is all academic, because 1) You won't get to choose, at least for a long while 2) if you're in the US, you're much more likely to get Moderna or Pfizer anyways within the next few months because the JnJ supply has to ramp up considerably.",,,1613364492,{},gni58jm,False,t3_ljy2id,False,True,t1_gnhry64,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ljy2id/you_think_the_us_has_vaccine_issues_130_countries/gni58jm/,1613368231,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_5tqv6ukv,False,False,,

The mere presence of alcohol is not, itself, the problem. So when a state decides to allow you to pick up booze at a drive thru, it's not the presence of booze that's the problem. It's the social and cultural outlooks that may or may not end up making it a problem. 

All told, I'm inclined to agree to an extent. We don't need to randomly start forcing people to be different just so people can have booze in their cars that they *might* drink from if they chose. I'm just saying that the issue isn't them having booze that they *could* drink in the car.

The reasons not to take it have to do with the South Africa variant.

Personally, I'm in a country where UK variant is spreading now, and stopping that spread will make the difference between a normal summer or no. AstraZeneca is effective against that. Pfizer shipments are increasing but not fast enough for summer, or at least early summer.

SA variant is rare now, so it'll be quite a while before it's dominant. By then (late summer/fall probably) we will have lots of mRNA vaccines and studies on how they work as boosters. My personal expectation is that if you've received AZ, and need additional protection for SA variant, a single dose of mRNA could work, although that's pretty much a guess.

China is the home for viral pandemics.  This is just an historical fact.  There is zero blame.  The avian highways bring many of the world's birds to the vast lakes of China.  The viruses are discovered in China.  They didn't originate there.  The birds brought them.  We remember Bird Flu.

Apparently, what WHO wants  is the earliest sequences.  What is a surprise to me, because China is a now a first world country, is the earliest sequences are not easily available, and preserved.  Again, this is not China's first encounter with pandemic.  It is the second in China's first world engagement.  In the US, every major hospital has a pathology lab.  How they operated, I don't know (but a friend is a manager of a large lab, and if the information is needed by you, I could post it within 24-48 hours)./

I don't believe it was December but mid or late November that there was already a crisis at the wet market.  Crisis meaning people were dying quickly.  Videos show people dying, not just dead.  China did amazing things.  New hospitals overnight.  Quarantine areas, etc.  But those are not the point.

You know the talk about the virology lab near the wet market.  You know the story, true or not, that a lab assistant removed an infected bird and sold to a wet market vendor.  an animal was named as the guilty animal, the fruit bat, and people were told not to eat it.  Confusion, yes.  But all along, because China is not Tuva, China was collecting samples, and in the samples were and are the sequences.  It would be irrational to believe China disposed of the samples.

In my mind, China needs to share the sequences related to those early samples.  China in Wuhan is way too modern not to have this information.

I am unaware of the details that WHO seeks.  WHO has disappointed me because I believe their leader has been himself dishonest with the truth when describing the probable outcome to the world of the exploding epidemic in China.  

The call by virologists around the world for China to be transparent became a shout by December.  We all know what a viral epidemic means; it means pandemic.  Pandemic required infection in more than China.  WHO acted horrifically as the rest of the world waited without going into full defensive mode waiting for WHO to say ""now"".

What's happening I think is that WHO cannot define what sequences it wants because it was not there to sign in the tissue samples.  And China is responding by saying, we can't help you.  That is disingenuous.  That is why the world doesn't trust China.  China's obligation is to poll its own records, looking in November for the deaths in Wuhan that match what we all know are the signatures of COVID19.  And where there are those deaths, search the pathology labs for documentation of possession of those samples.

WHO apparently claims there are up to 500.  

It is surprising that China itself has not produced this report.  The sequences may be valuable to some scholars in the world to attempt to deduce what actually happened, because this epidemic broke out with no prior warning, nothing.  One day nothing, the next day, explosion of cases, few to many within a week or two.  

There is no alternative but to find the earliest sequences to see how this virus started in humans.

China is losing an opportunity to be a world leader here.  China wants credibility.  I doubt that the WHO team was a group of functionaries.  Some were as skilled as the virologists in China.  

In closing, if I were in China, I would want to write the book on the inception of this virus.  I would be written into history.  My career would be guaranteed.  

At this time, the world is suspicious.  China can make its case, but not by saying, we don't know, and what sequences.  This is a human effort.  Everyone wants to get to case #1, but I doubt we will get there, but China can help get very, very close to that case.

&gt;Risk compensation and face mask mandates during the COVID19 pandemic Abstract Face masks are an important component in controlling COVID-19, and policy orders to wear masks are common. However, behavioral responses are seldom additive, and exchanging one protective behavior for another could undermine the COVID-19 policy response. We use SafeGraph smart device location data and variation in the date that US states and counties issued face mask mandates as a set of natural experiments to investigate risk compensation behavior. **We compare time at home and the number of visits to public locations before and after face mask orders conditional on multiple statistical controls. We find that face mask orders lead to risk compensation behavior.** Americans subject to the mask orders spend 11–24 fewer minutes at home on average and increase visits to some commercial locations—most notably restaurants, which are a high-risk location. It is unclear if this would lead to a net increase or decrease in transmission. However, it is clear that mask orders would be an important part of an economic recovery if people otherwise overestimate the risk of visiting public places.",,,1613389547,{},gniyofa,False,t3_lk8xjt,False,True,t3_lk8xjt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lk8xjt/daily_discussion_thread_february_15_2021/gniyofa/,1613389557,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_53hbxlwz,False,False,,

&gt;The reactogenicity of the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna  is likely largely due to the bubble of fat used to package the mRNA.  These bubbles, called lipid nanoparticles, seem to stimulate the immune  system in animals even when empty. In the past, vaccine makers sometimes  have added a second ingredient to a vaccine, called an adjuvant, to  enhance the immune response. The lipid nanoparticle, originally designed  to protect the mRNA and smuggle it inside cells, just happened to act  as an adjuvant as well. “It’s like a three-in-one package,” Fuller says.

This was about 2 months before the WHO or the US had declared a pandemic. I'm not sure he was wrong at this point.

&gt;Feb 17, 2020 - Fauci explains that masks are ineffective and that the risk of getting COVID is minusculely low

I do agree that he was wrong here about masks. My understanding was that they were trying to save PPE for healthcare workers and didn't want a run on masks by the general public. He should have elaborated on this and been upfront about the importance of masks to prevent spread. This was a month before the US declared a pandemic though, so the risk at the time was still low.

&gt;March 9, 2020 - Fauci explains that taking a cruise could be a fun and safe thing to do if you are healthy

This was still before the WHO or the US had declared a pandemic and there was only 1 known outbreak on a cruise ship that I am aware of. And his message that it's ok if you are young and healthy doesn't seem that off base at the time.

&gt;July 17, 2020 - Fauci explains how New York handled the pandemic correctly

I'm not sure what your issue is here.

&gt;July 24, 2020 - Fauci sits at a baseball game without a mask on and without social distancing

This seems like a stretch. He's outdoors with 2 close friends and takes his mask off briefly?

Overall though, I don't think any of these links conflict with Fauci's overall message since the pandemic was declared about wearing a mask (or 2) and to practice social distancing.

They site that they can count on one hand how many places manufacture these devices. My opinion: So? They arent on Pluto. They're still made on earth of earthbound materials by earthlings. 

My concern are bottlenecks within the bottlenecks where those (specialized equipment) companies are reliant on one or few individuals with specific skills or know-how. Getting this knowledge to others is what would likely take some time and hold up the process for everyone else.

There will always be a new strain and we’ll have to put the goalposts on Jupiter “out of an abundance of caution.” I guess I should adjust to wearing a mask everywhere in public for the rest of my life at this point (even when not sick) because the public and government leaders will never want to give them up. 

My office isn’t even talking about reopening. Not even an estimated date that’s subject to change. I took a day off on Friday because I was feeling burned out. It barely helped. I had a sense of dread when I went to sign back in this morning. I just don’t want to do the work from home alone thing anymore.

I do get out of the house and visit my family where possible and I wear a mask in public. But having nothing notable to look forward to is taking its toll.

I think it depends on your definition of herd immunity. The scientific definition is a state where R is less than 1. Using this definition India reached herd immunity in mid September.

We know that immunity can wain and the virus can undergo antigenic drift. As the surveys show there are different levels of immunity in different communities, the country, urban and in slums. This would also imply their is different reproduction numbers in these communities.

So yes I would say India has reached herd immunity, but changing seasons, change in behaviour or in immune population will lead to further outbreaks.

T Cells:

&gt;**The CD8+ T cell response in COVID-19**  
&gt;  
&gt;There appears to be heterogeneity in the immune response between patients. Some studies have reported that CD8+ T cells from patients with severe COVID-19 had reduced cytokine production following in vitro stimulation, and some have shown evidence of possibly exhausted T cells; in contrast, other studies have reported an overaggressive CD8+ T cell response or highly activated CD8+ T cells with increased cytotoxic response in patients with COVID-19 \[14\].  
&gt;  
&gt;It is still unclear how the heterogeneity of the CD8+ T cell response relates to disease features, which could be driven by, for example, patient immunotypes \[17,19\] or the nature of the interaction between respiratory epithelial cells and cytotoxic T cells and the level of response.  
&gt;  
&gt;Several chemokine receptor genes (including CCR9, CXCR6, and XCR1) and the locus controlling the ABO blood type have been identified as being associated with severe disease; however, whether these genes are directly or indirectly related to T cell responses in COVID-19 remains unknown \[14\].  
&gt;  
&gt;A higher proportion of CD8+ T cell responses was observed in patients who only developed mild disease, suggesting a potential protective role of CD8+ T cell responses \[11\]. Most of the CD8+ T cell responses were specific to viral internal proteins, rather than spike proteins, which should be considered in vaccine development \[4\]. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells are present in about 70% of patients who have recovered \[18\], which is evidence of a virus-specific CD8+ T cell response and the presence of CD8+ T cell memory. **However, the ability of these cells to protect from future infection remains to be determined.**

I think there were assumptions that two doses are better than one and would boost the efficacy and duration but I'm not sure these assumptions were tested.

If you look carefully at the data, the efficacy of one shot is 90%+ or higher, [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/l5fxba/israel_has_now_given_approximately_42_of_its/gkuqs3f/) is one explanation.

So it very well may be that one dose is enough for excellent efficacy but that doesn't mean they are going to change anything, they will stick with what's been tested.

We're not just talking about pricing; we're talking about access to affordable housing that one can build equity in. Pricing inequalities come from an entirely different - but adjacent group of structural flaws and inefficiencies that are so built into our housing markets that we take them for granted.

&gt;And you're assuming everyone wants to own their own home.  Lots of  people rent because they don't want be tied to a piece of land.  Lots of  people want apartment-style amenities (pool, fitness center, etc.) that  are less available in condo-style buildings.  Lots of people don't want  to pay the entire purchase price when they can live in a nicer unit  than they could otherwise afford.

You are helping to make the point that I just expounded on. Why wouldn't or couldn't the amenities be available to communities and homeowners if housing was not artificially constrained? Why should landlords have to build these things for us? Why can't we have them as a means to sustainable personal and societal future instead of giving our equity to rent-seeking landlords?  You are even making assumptions about what people \*want\* in their housing, as if those ""wants"" haven't been conditioned by decades and even centuries of desire conditioned by those who control shelter and housing access? (i.e. those who hold the power of wealth and use that wealth to constrain supplies of sustainable goods in order to gain more profit)

Also, where is the economic VALUE that is created by landlords, given the \*fact\* of the artificial constraining of supply.

Re: ""dint"" - I know that but Google voice doesn't.

You're also making assumptions about multi-family housing and condos that have little to do with my claim that landlords do not create economic value; they extract value. When you look at all the variables, it's impossible to deny that unless one wants to lay down a smokescreen that is full of arguments that (with due respect) gaslight the fact that it's artificial constrains that make landlords possible - that's always been the case.

Source. The USA has only in the last few weeks announced that it will even join.

&gt; All we are asking is that the UK let’s countries like Belgium, where the death toll has been higher than in any other major country keep a few more of the vaccines that are actually made in its country

What are you talking about? The UK gets no AZ vaccines made in Belgium. The UK gets to keep the first 100m produced in the UK, which is no different to the fact that the EU gets to keep the first 300m produced in Belgium. Not the UK's fault the EU was late to sign a deal.

&gt; All we are asking

Actually, the UK has not been asked. The EU has simply demanded and made legal threats which amounted to nothing because they know they haven't got a leg to stand on. They've completely shut up about it since the contract was released.

&gt; But it would not be a big problem to slow the UK roll out a little

Why not slow the rollout in all of the 26 EU countries that are worse affected than the UK or Belgium? Why are you singling out Britain? Most EU countries are better off so why aren't they doing more to share the burden? Why isn't Hungary sending its Russian vaccines to Belgium?

&gt; It just makes me understand that the UK truly never was as committed to Europe as we are to it.

So committed you tried to trigger Article 16. LOL.

&gt; India and Russia are going to be picking up the slag

The Serium Institute of India is producing 1.3bn AZ vaccines this year, **at cost**, because the UK has gone out of its way to ensure anyone who can produce the vaccine is doing so, while insisting they do it at cost.

&gt; Lots of lost soft power for the USA and UK.

Not for the UK. The UK has done more for other countries than anyone. It's made its genomics capability available to the world to track mutations. It gave its vaccine away at cost. It's donated more to Gavi and COVAX than anyone.

I think an increasingly common misconception about this vaccine is that the main benefit is to prevent you from being symptomatic - the main benefit is that it trains your body in detecting the virus early and mounting a strong enough immune response that it effectively fights off the virus and prevents is proliferation in your body.

This last one is, in my view, probably due to the reduced perceived utility from testing, as infection has shifted to the lowest-risk population, with the fewest symptoms, and because there is still no effective outpatient therapy, so testing has less perceived advantage to the patient at this point. People who would get tests are older, and they are either eagerly getting vaccinated or keeping their heads down and their masks up, until their appointment comes up.

These factors are contributing variously in various locations, and it is not possible to know which is the dominant factor, nor would greater knowledge significantly affect public health policy at this time.

Taking steps that only *appear* to reduce the risk of Covid as a form of “Covid absolutism” — attempts to reduce even the tiniest risk of Covid — ultimately can backfire and cause increased spread of Covid from knock on effects. Banning students on campus from taking outdoor walks, for example, can lead to increased instances of indoor gatherings with other students as they go stir crazy indoors — a dramatically more risky event. 

We shame and scoff at joggers without a mask thirty feet away from us because we *want* the virus to map cleanly onto our associations with other dangers — the familiar is safe and the dangerous strangers are what’s causing the problem. People do this and then turn around and hang out with their friends indoors with no mask because we have mutual trust — and wonder why the virus keeps spreading.

We need public health plans and messaging that account for human behavior and we need to avoid Covid absolutism — shaming someone distanced at the park for having no mask is likely not helping us and may even be actively hurting us in the long run. We need to have a common understanding of how this thing spreads and why it’s so important not to do certain activities while the virus is around — and I think we sort of do but also we have a lot of people who are infested in Covid absolutism as a form of denial about how the virus really spreads (primarily indoors through aerosols and extended contact with other people.)",,,1613359976,{},gnhxv6f,False,t3_ljkcyh,False,False,t3_ljkcyh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ljkcyh/daily_discussion_thread_february_14_2021/gnhxv6f/,1613364929,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_88u6mxd9,False,False,,

Nobody was advising to wear masks back then unless it was just their best guess at what might help because there was no data to support the need for masks in the general public.

You can keep reaching and taking his comments out of context if you want, but I recommend just getting educated on the matter instead.

Here's some more info on the matter since idiots like Trump also tried to take Fauci out of context like you have:

&gt; While Fauci, along with several other US health leaders, initially advised people not to wear masks, Fauci later said that he was concerned that there wouldn’t be enough protective equipment for health care workers. This was also early in the pandemic before public health experts fully knew how contagious the disease was and how it spread.

&gt; Fauci explained that at that time, “we were not aware that 40 to 45% of people were asymptomatic, nor were we aware that a substantial proportion of people who get infected get infected from people who are without symptoms. That makes it overwhelmingly important for everyone to wear a mask.”  

&gt; “So when people say, ‘Well, why did you change your stance? And why are you emphasizing masks so much now when back then you didn't -- and in fact you even said you shouldn't because there was a shortage of masks?’ Well the data now are very, very clear,” he said.    

&gt; “We need to put that nonsense behind us about ‘well, they keep changing their minds,’ ” Fauci said.    

&gt; As to Fauci’s other comments, while he occasionally sought to reassure Americans in the very early days of the virus, he consistently advised to follow CDC guidelines and that things could change.

So, thank goodness I am not in teaching this year, but if I were, I would want the vaccine. You would have a super high exposure rate being around the little kids! They have no boundaries and you are typically packed into sardine classroom sizes. One of my Kindergarten kiddos brought H1N1 to me when I was pregnant with my second, and I literally almost died from it. I actually still have blood pressure issues from it....so if I had been teaching this year, I would have quit before risking myself teaching Kindergarten. 

Also, it helps the workforce to have schools open consistently. We have been open since August and have had to go on and off hybrid schedules because of the high numbers at our schools. Teachers have to take their sick time to quarantine, and then no one wants to come in to sub during a pandemic with little kids that are already kinda gross, so then you have to combine classes so you have even more kids in one room, which leads to more kids getting it and higher community spread, and/or you have to go virtual due to lack of staff, which parents get mad at because then they either have to call in sick...or parents get sick and they have to call in sick......

&gt; What happened next showcases the power of China’s global messaging machine.

&gt; On Twitter alone, Zhao’s aggressive spray of 11 tweets on March 12 and 13 was cited over 99,000 times over the next six weeks, in at least 54 languages, according to analysis conducted by DFRLab. The accounts that referenced him had nearly 275 million followers on Twitter – a number that almost certainly includes duplicate followers and does not distinguish fake accounts.

Excuse me if I am distinctly unimpressed. Anyone who has been on Twitter knows that 99K interactions over 11 tweets is pretty underwhelming and my memory of it at the time was that the vast majority of the interaction was people dunking on him, not supporting him. 

One of the things we know about China vs Russia is that China's external propaganda game is not anywhere remotely on the same level. China devotes the majority of it's propaganda apparatus towards domestic propaganda and propaganda on foreign outlets in Chinese. When academics have looked at Chinese foreign language propaganda on platforms like Twitter, they find people with a poor grasp of English tweeting out low effort tweets to an audience of only other propaganda accounts. What's more, their attempts seem to be getting worse over time, not better.

This has been and will continue to be a major geopolitical weakness of China over time and one which China structurally struggles to overcome.

&gt;The point is that new plants specifically for COVID vaccines are being put up in multiple countries, not just retrofitted

What you're seeing are plants that didn't exist, because many of those countries didn't have infrastructure in place, yet you're somehow trying to imply that EU capacity production is rendered useless because some countries had to develop plants? I really don't understand this. BioNTech is buying new plants, and will have the capacity to produce 750 million vaccines, so this is on TOP of EU capacity... like, EU companies can't develop/acquire new infrastructures? 


&gt;Using tetanus vaccines to support ""the EU makes 70% of all COVID vaccines"" is a gross misrepresentation of the data you used that is A) almost 12 months old and B) not related to the COVID vaccine specifically.

Nah you're trying to be funny to get an outlier example of Tetanus vaccines, to try to imply that part of EU production capacity and technology is pointless for COVID efforts - which is just plain stupid. You're assuming that the knowledge and infrastructure in place is useless, and that there's no capacity for further development lol

&gt;If you've been waiting for a big national campaign telling you COVID-19 vaccines are safe and everybody should get them, don't hold your breath. Until the supply is plentiful, ***the federal effort is largely focused on minority communities hesitant about the immunizations.***

&gt;  
&gt;**It's a wise approach, say experts.** 

&amp;#x200B;

my city has a 2 mass vax centers. you go to the site, put your name on the list, they email you 24 hrs before your appt - this is for anyone who is eligible.

&amp;#x200B;

there are also four community centers.

no appointments, no sign ups, walk up only.

have to meet age and address requirements only (zip code)

&amp;#x200B;

early in the pandemic, these zips were targeted for mass testing. 

they tested every resident so they've got solid demographic info.

Putting an opposition leader in a quarantine facility is not going to help the government. There is wifi and 4g in a quarantine facility, an opposition leader can easily criticize the government from inside with his smart phone.

I have quite low trust of my government in Belgium but precisely because they did not enforce quarantines and locked down way to late. They let 20k people die for no good reason and ruined the economy because they don't want to take responsibility (and destroyed the strategic mask reserve in 2018).

In Belgium there has been some abuse of power (mayors rounding up teenagers hanging around) but the public reaction has corrected this abuse swiftly.

I'm all for civil rights and democracy but I feel that during this pandemic a lot of discussion let to delays in necessary measures causing way too many people to die. Discussion is important but we cannot let it paralyse us from doing the right thing in a timely fashion.

It is a bit similar to the ongoing battle against climate change. It is very clear what is happening and needs to be done yet governments hold endless discussions about the best course of action and keep on postponing the transition to a co2 neutral economy even though there are only advantages. Like Germany building coal power plants? How did that happen? And now in Belgium they also decided to build more gas power plants! It's 2021 we should be closing gas power plants!

Due to people who are incapable or unwilling to accept the seriousness of this virus and various governments' unwillingness to enact and enforce strict lockdowns ***and then*** reasonable protective measures, we've had to endure a fucking year of half-assed lockdowns. 

A ***FULL*** lockdown, actually adhered to and actually enforced, for a period of two months all but eradicate the virus in whichever area was locked down. No, that doesn't mean literally everyone is literally stuck in their homes for two months. It means no indoor dining, every single person who can work from home does work from home. Everyone who can't work from home and doesn't have a job that absolutely must be done has the government pay their wages. Protective equipment and measures for businesses that need to stay open. Restaurants can do delivery or take out, grocery stores allow curbside pickup. 

You don't get to blame someone's shitty behavior on lockdowns. COVID didn't make people abuse and assault others, they chose to do it. 

Children can and will catch up, don't bring up bullshit about how they will never catch up. Furthermore, it's been an entire year, there's been more than enough time to improve remote learning for younger children. 

The overwhelming majority of failed businesses and lost jobs did not need to happen. The government could have and should have paid wages to prevent layoffs and issued halts on all mortgage and lease payments. 

But no. We had people who said it was a hoax, said it doesn't affect anyone under 80, and don't wear a mask, and don't pay people to stay home. 

We could have stopped this thing in its tracks if we had done an ***actual*** lockdown last March, or April, or May, or June, or literally any time including now. And we chose not to, because fuck you I do what I want with my freedom.

I want to be able to go shopping without having to eyeball everyone else in the store. I want to have a regular Boy Scout campout where I don't have to take temperatures twice a day and have to remind them to mask up constantly. I'm tired of the hoops we jump through at work getting contractors onsite. I'm tired of seeing friends and family announce they have covid on Facebook and me having to worry about them ... especially since a few of them are now gone. I'd like to watch a crowd scene in a movie and the first thing I notice is no one is wearing a mask and it setting my defenses on edge.

Then if you read on you can see she's several months behind in rent.  

Right or wrong, I can see why a judge might grant this. Tenant's perspective is that its unfair that an exhausting illness was the final straw. Landlord's perspective is hey, why are we always last in line to get paid? Three months isn't ""several months"", but five is. I feel bad for her, but five months is a lot of months, and it sounds like the landlord has been understanding, as she was at least three months behind pre-illness and the landlord hadn't evicted her yet. She might be 7 months behind.

One of the qualifications for the CDC eviction ban is ""Tenant must make an effort to pay at least part of their rent."" I'm sure there are several people particularly in NYC who have decided that 2020 has been rent free since April. Landlords can't forgive rent forever. Since the woman couldn't show up for her trial, all the judge sees are a lot of missed payments.  

Unfortunately there is going to be a day of reckoning soon. The CDC can't hold off rent payments forever and eventually everybody who is 3 months behind or more is going to get booted at the same time.

The idea was that the people who are most susceptible to both getting infected and infecting the most other people, perhaps because they have a job that involves a lot of human interaction or they refuse to wear a mask, get infected first and their immunity protects the rest of the population.

Those estimates seemed to explain Europe’s and the Northeastern US’ summer pause in cases, but they proved obviously inaccurate when these and many other places saw massive resurgences in the fall. But then we might have swung too far the other way in assuming we need something like 70% immunity to slow the pandemic down. 

When you look at a city like Los Angeles and see the massive disparities in case rates between different neighborhoods and racial groups it makes sense that once the virus has devastated communities with overcrowded housing and lots of essential workers too much of the population remaining to infect would be wealthier people who work from home. Those people are harder to infect and aren’t as likely to infect many others if they are infected (especially now that the holidays are over), so if some restrictions continue to be in place it makes sense that case rates would be coming down.

I’m surprised the article doesn’t mention any of this. I would be more worried about new variants if cases weren’t dropping so rapidly right now.

In January every country in Europe said there wasn't a need to worry about COVID. 

In February every country in Europe said masks were ineffective and the threat of COVID was very low. This was a mistake *every* country made (well except some Asian countries that wear masks when sick anyway). The mistake was that there was no clear data that wearing a non-medical (i.e. non N95) face mask would help. Once data started to show it did in fact slow the spread the messaging changed. There was also a certain level of political pressure here as well due to many countries not having enough face masks for their healthcare workers and being concerned it would create a shortage. 

In March every country in Europe had no restrictions on travel. At least at the start of March. This is when shit got real though and suddenly COVID was a big deal in Europe and lockdowns began. 

I can't answer with regards to New York as I am not American. 

The picture of Fauci at the baseball game is disingenuous though. It was from when he was asked to throw the first pitch and the two people sitting next to him were people he was regularly around anyway. It isn't like he is in a crowd of 50 strangers and he didn't wear a mask at all. 

That's part of the problem with a new virus though. Everyone, even the medical professionals, are working blind. As they learn more their advice changes. It sucks at times as what we thought was correct changes over night and we have to adjust to changes but that's just how it is. 

While Fauci (and pretty much everyone else) got stuff wrong I think his history shows he is the kind of person you want in charge of a pandemic response. 

I feel the attacks on Fauci specifically are strange and unfair. The guy is 80 years old, he has given his whole life to public healthcare. He could have easily made a hundred times his current salary in the private industry if he wanted to decades ago after he made a name for himself back in the 70s and 80s but stayed in public healthcare.

I have not seen most of my friends since March. I have not seen most of my coworkers since March. I have not been to a party, out to eat, played video games with others since March. My coworkers and I used to play games after work every single day. 

I'm one of 3 or 4 people who go into my \~200 person office because just getting to see one or two people a day through a glass wall is better than no one. About a month ago I went to sit on the couch we use to play games because I thought it might help. I sobbed for about 10 minutes. 

Around October or November I was organizing some things and saw a bottle of bleach and lingered on it for just a little bit too long.

And that curve *didn't happen* in Australia, New Zealand, or Taiwan--the virus didn't ""simply take its course"" there; it hardly took any course at all. 

Why not? I would argue that it's for the same reason that today, with almost no cases, 70% of people in AU still like having their borders closed. In contrast, Alaska, with a daily incidence of 22/100k, has declared its emergency over and removed travel restrictions, with less than 8% of their population fully vaccinated. 

So for me, it's hard to look at Australia or New Zealand, versus Alaska, and not judge that individuals and authorities both have great influence over the course of the contagion.

Well I'm sorry but either you're too blind or you don't want to see:

&gt;**It came after AstraZeneca Plc announced large delivery cuts to the EU, and had told EU officials it could not ship doses from factories in Britain because of obligations it had under a contract with the British government**, EU officials told Reuters in January.

&gt;**London has said it has no export ban in place for COVID-19 vaccines, but has repeatedly declined to comment on whether the contract it has with AstraZeneca prevents shipment of doses to the EU.**

[Source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccine-export-idUSKBN2AB29N?utm_source=reddit.com)

It's literally there, hiding behind a contract. There was no warning, they don't release the contract, they don't even comment on it. Why are you, and many others, trying to deny this? Like, own up to it.

**They basically changed the contract terms with the EU 8 weeks before delivery**, and UK govt. doesn't have the honesty to be clear about it, just to not look bad trying to disguise a export ban. All so they can wave in a high moral ground about ""everyone must do their fair share"", while not sharing a single fucking vaccine with anyone until they're done. **It's hypocrisy to it's maximum.**

And you say ""oh everyone was expecting this""... it's ridiculous and shameful. EU was notified literally in January, from AZ itself.

and then the whole fuss about export control and ""trying to torch peace"", what a load of bullshit - trying to diverge the fact that UK isn't exporting a single vaccine and maintain a moral high ground. Well you can't have them both, and thankfully that's being noticed by international community. **Be transparent.**

**Why not make the contracts public?** Right?

So yeah, good on EU to have a choke hold on vaccine exports, and tightly control it from now on, enough with this bullshit.

&gt;Overall your argument is based on anger and misinformation.

So far your comments are the ones based on misinformation and brexit propaganda. Claiming everyone knew about AZ contract with UK (??!!) when UK govt refuses to comment on it. Then you blab about 3 months of delay, like it's EU responsibility to make vaccines and set orders (??!!).

Not only acting like China by imposing control over private companies, UK govt. refuses to comment on the contract and tries to save face on the international theater.

[https://www.milenio.com/ciencia-y-salud/calendario-vacunas-covid-mexico-2021](https://www.milenio.com/ciencia-y-salud/calendario-vacunas-covid-mexico-2021)

Apparently 870,000 doses from the Serum Institute in India where to arrive in Feb, so these are those and we are on schedule, and are expecting 1'600,00 doses in March. Other suppliers have differnet timelines. All AZ-Oxford vaccines are now intended to population over 60.

The propposed calendar from the government expected to give vaccines to medical personnel directly in Covid areas from December to February... medical personnel is getting the Pfizer but deliveries stopped in January as we all know due to Pfizer reconfiguration but I hope all medical personnel can be vaccinated by the end of February, Pfizer deliveries were to resume today. 

The vaccination plan was published in December scheduled people over 60 were from February - April... the rollout for the rest of us will go slowly all the way to June 2022 :( Hopefully plan can be updated.

As of yesterday roughly 700k doses of the Pfizer vaccine had been administered. A lot of medical personnel are still waiting for second doses.

Lastly a bit of estimates:

Population: 126 million

Covid medical personnel: 250,000

All medical personnel: 3'100,000

Population over 60: 30 million

Most people don't like to wear masks. But the rules say they have to wear masks, and the evidence suggests that's a good idea due to the extreme conditions of the pandemic. But psychologically, the effect is that someone is telling you to do something you don't want to without an immediately apparent public benefit. People are going to want to resist that and it's stupid to pretend that isn't going to happen.

Moves like this were practically inevitable. People don't want to do what they're told, so they'll pay not to as if that's somehow better.

&gt; A ***FULL*** lockdown, actually adhered to and actually enforced, for a period of two months all but eradicate the virus in whichever area was locked down. No, that doesn't mean literally everyone is literally stuck in their homes for two months. It means no indoor dining, every single person who can work from home does work from home. Everyone who can't work from home and doesn't have a job that absolutely must be done has the government pay their wages. Protective equipment and measures for businesses that need to stay open. Restaurants can do delivery or take out, grocery stores allow curbside pickup. 

This doesn't work, we did this in the UK for 3 months last year and it reduced the cases but came nowhere close to eradicating the virus. We're now doing it again for 3 months and it's again obvious that we won't get anywhere near eradication. It was much the same across all of Europe. Aside from the few countries which have both a fairly low population and borders which can be completely sealed the idea that you can eradicate Covid through lockdowns is absurd, even then it requires permanently closed borders. We have too many people essential to keeping the country functioning at a basic level who have to interact with each other to some degree for this to ever work.

&gt;You don't get to blame someone's shitty behavior on lockdowns. COVID didn't make people abuse and assault others, they chose to do it. 

Are you seriously engaging in such bad faith that you're claiming I'm excusing domestic abuse? Obviously the individuals are responsible. But these policies have created more opportunities for them to carry out their abusive behaviour and less options for victims escape, or for people to notice the level of abuse they're suffering from. The conclusion of this line of thinking would also be that we can never enact policy to reduce domestic abuse. After all, policy doesn't make them do it right? 

&gt;Children can and will catch up, don't bring up bullshit about how they will never catch up. Furthermore, it's been an entire year, there's been more than enough time to improve remote learning for younger children. 

It's not bullshit at all. UK education experts have recently stated they are very worried that a substantial number of children will never catch up. Particularly those from a disadvantaged background. Remote learning is especially lacking for these children. But apparently you somehow know better? 

&gt;The overwhelming majority of failed businesses and lost jobs did not need to happen. The government could have and should have paid wages to prevent layoffs and issued halts on all mortgage and lease payments.

Basically all of that did happen here. However even with the vast support business have been given the cracks are showing. There's a limit to how long we can artificially hold together an economy and we'll be reaching a breaking point soon.

&gt; But no. We had people who said it was a hoax, said it doesn't affect anyone under 80, and don't wear a mask, and don't pay people to stay home. 

Ok? 

&gt;We could have stopped this thing in its tracks if we had done an ***actual*** lockdown last March, or April, or May, or June, or literally any time including now. And we chose not to, because fuck you I do what I want with my freedom. 

As I said, we did an 'actual lockdown' here (and across most of Europe), it provides some benefit for a limited amount of time. It gets nowhere even close to eradication. 

&gt; Instead of two months of really shitty lockdown we've had a year of fake lockdown because of people like you. You are the cause of the thing about which you whine.

AZ seems to be the worst affected as a small trial over there showed minimal protection against mild to moderate symptoms. Although as the participants we're all young and healthy we can't draw any real conclusions from that study. So there's a chance it may still prevent severe symptoms and hospitlisations. Moderna/pfizer doesn't have any trial data on it but lab studies suggest it works still but would be naive to think it still offers 95% protection. It's likely all the vaccines should still atleast prevent severe symptoms and hospitlisations even if it has reduced efficiency against mild to moderate symptoms.
