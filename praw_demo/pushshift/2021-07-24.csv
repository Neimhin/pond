The safety of the Covid vaccines are not in question, not even the efficacy of them is. The point here is that millions of people gave no second thought at all to complying with a vaccine mandate concerning their **12-13 yr old children** and live happily with legitimate actual full on “vaccine passport” laws making vaccination a requirement to become a US citizen. This isn’t about health, safety OR freedom and it’s time to stop humoring these temper tantrums. 

What’s at stake is not the deaths of those from Covid. What’s at stake at the _very_ least is the repeated chronic disabling of billions of people for 4-6 weeks, at least once or twice a year, in massive waves at the same time, and the very real fallout of those who end up with “Long” Covid and those who are permanently disabled by pulmonary and cardiac disease.

In the UK where I live we have largely vaccinated everyone vulnerable and are at the stage of offering vaccines to healthy 18+ who really (statistically) would be fine if the caught it.


A lot of spread is necessary if you don’t have the vaccine supply. This is what was done in northern Europe and is now being done in the UK and, while
I’m sure there are many watching us hoping to fail, it is the correct decision - we want to vaccinate all over 18s but they are reluctant and reasonably so, it is their body, their choice and they really aren’t at risk of killing anyone anymore given the number of double vaccinated vulnerable.

So it is spreading among the under 30s, and yes there is a percentage of them being hospitalised and another percentage within that require serious care - but  not enough of a percentage to warrant closing down,  because we - as a country- have recognised that unfortunately some people get sick and die but it wasn’t part of our day before.

Aus need to realise that vaccines or herd immunity through infection and survival are their way out of this. Continuing to lock people down, close business, strangle tourism and keep this isolationist approach will not work long term, I promise you.

Vaccines teach or train the immune system, so that the body can:

1. identify the virus upon encountering it, and

2. know how to make customized warheads (antibodies) that are designed just for that virus.

But upon exposure to the virus, there's a delay in this immune response.  It's not instant.  And this latency period is made worse by how quickly the delta variant hijacks cells and makes copies.  It has a head start on hijacking before the antibodies are activated.

This is why vaccinated people are still testing positive.  And it's also why unvaccinated people are getting hit so hard.  It's not that delta is crazier than other variants.. it's simply that it copies hella faster than others.

It was a fair bit busier this time too, had to queue for ~30 minutes and there was a good 50 people waiting. 

Major cities like where I live (Sheffield) now have drop-in places where anyone can turn up and get vaccinated. NHS number is optional, so even undocumented folk can get jabbed. If you've had 1 vax already and have a card most of the places have every vaccine available so can give you pfizer/astra/etc. 

A friend of mine had his second jab booked already (he booked via the NHS site so you can pre-book your second one) and had an email saying he could move it forward as his second one was booked 12 weeks out. He moved it and it allowed him to also pick the exact 8 week date, so there's plenty of availability around.

I have to say I've been very impressed by the efficiency of it all, it feels odd for something to be going this well in England!",,,,1627214281,{},h6gs2yp,False,t3_oqu2iz,False,True,t1_h6e3oqu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oqu2iz/covid19_uk_cases_fall_for_fourth_day_in_a_row_as/h6gs2yp/,1627355007,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Unfortunately a ten year old passed away July 12th who was positive. His cause of death will be unknown for four months according to the coroner. But this, paired with some infections already spreading some (we won't know how much really but they update the school district Covid dashboard every Tuesday and I think Friday, they sent out a survey to ask parents what their thoughts are on the current protocol. 



At the moment and this could change soon, masks inside, none outside, they eat in the cafeteria as a large group (some people are reporting that they are trying to socially distance students as a newer precaution a few days in) but the biggest surprise to parents is that when you're told your child is a close contact of a positive case (friend your child ate with at lunch, so unmasked), it's an unexcused absence if you keep them home while you wait for results. So you send them until a confirmed positive or symptoms. If they are positive, no alternative education is provided and that absence is excused. Basically you can either do the virtual academy only or in-person but no overlap. 



I get all the logic behind these guidelines and decisions, but they were developed pre-Delta. There is a petition started by parents who want more precautions, then other parents who want to stop all precautions, but they have not started a petition they are just yelling at other parents online. The main thing I think should change is the unexcused absence punishment. For parents who work from home or have help and can keep their child home while waiting for the results, they should not have to fear being truant. I'm not sure what to think, we will be watching the numbers before ours start on their schedule next month (the elementary schools have traditional and year round calendars but the middle and high school are on the traditional calendar). 



My guess is when the CDC provides new guidelines for Delta in schools, the definition of ""close contact"" will be a wider range because it's looking like Delta is contracted from however many more feet than Alpha.",,,,1627180051,{},h6fl64n,False,t3_oqv7lg,False,False,t1_h6fjjmv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oqv7lg/coronavirus_in_california_vaccinated_and_worried/h6fl64n/,1627331125,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Up to now, Vietnam has secured deals for 130 million doses of vaccines and is in talks with other manufacturers on deals for a further 40 million shots, he said, adding that the shots are expected to arrive in 2021 and early 2022.

The decision, issued by the Standing Committee of the HCMC Party Committee, came as the city has recorded over 48,800 local Covid-19 cases in the fourth coronavirus wave, with numbers rising for each passing day with little obvious signs of improvement.  
  
Two weeks under the social distancing order as dictated by Directive 16, which requires people to stay home unless to buy food, medications and other emergencies, infections in the city remain rampant especially in quarantine zones and locked down areas. As the number of cases increases, so does the burden on the healthcare system, stretching medical workers, equipment and infrastructure to the limit, said the municipal Party Committee.  
  
To curb the spread of the virus, the city now require residents inside locked down areas to absolutely not make direct contact with those around them. People in such areas are only allowed to leave home in case of medical emergencies, and are limited to leave homes to buy essential food products only twice a week.  
  
In certain high-risk areas, residents are banned from leaving homes entirely and local authorities would deliver food and other necessities directly to them instead.  
  
The city would also suspend all business and production, as well as non-urgent construction sites. Banks and stock market facilities are only allowed to operate at an adequate level to meet necessary demands, including by dividing shifts. Government institutions would divide shifts among their workforce as well.

July 24, 2021  


Vladimir Putin planned the worldwide distribution of the Sputnik V vaccine by the Gamaleya laboratory as a major marketing and public relations campaign for his country. But things do not seem to be going in the best way due to the difficulties and delays that arose in production that have prevented meeting the terms of the contracts and are already causing concern and cancellations in Latin American countries.  
From north to south of the American continent, there are 9 countries that signed contracts with the Direct Investment Fund of Russia (RDIF, for its acronym in English), the government agency in charge of marketing Sputnik V: Argentina, Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua , Honduras, Bolivia, Venezuela, Paraguay and Guyana.  
Six of them have raised their voices with complaints about the delays. Two others also received late and less than the promised doses, but prefer to keep a low profile so as not to damage their political relationship with Moscow. Because of all these problems, another country canceled the contract it was about to sign when it realized that the Russians would not be able to fulfill it.  
There is not only the general problem of delays in shipments well beyond the deadlines established in the contracts. The particularity of Sputnik V, the only vaccine against COVID-19 that has two different components that must be applied in each inoculation, exacerbated the problem. It is that the production of component 1 (with the viral vector Ad26) has advanced at a slightly higher speed than that of the second (Ad5). Thus, millions of people who received the first dose are waiting to receive the second, greatly exceeding the 21 days between the two that had been programmed in the beginning and even the 3 months interval that were later postulated as reasonable when the delays.  
This is a review of the problems that different Latin American countries have been suffering with the provision of Sputnik V.

Argentina  
It was the country in the region that most strongly entrusted the fate of its vaccination plan to Suptnik V and, as a consequence, one of the countries that had the most problems in completing the complete scheme. Since the vaccines arrived from Moscow at the end of 2020 until this month , slightly more than 7 million Argentines were inoculated with the first dose of Sputnik V, but just over a million received the second.  
The restlessness in the population was increasing as the months went by and the second doses did not arrive. The atmosphere was further clouded by the decision of the Argentine government to entrust the vaccination against Covid-19 mainly to the Russian vaccine, (and to a lesser extent in the Chinese sinopharm and the English AstraZeneca), postponing the signing of contracts without clear explanations with the US companies Pfizer (which also carried out part of its clinical trials in Argentina), Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson.  
During this time, the Argentine laboratory Richmond signed an agreement with Gamaleya to produce the vaccine locally, but it is a process that is just beginning and is progressing slowly.  
This week the harsh letter from a senior advisor to President Alberto Fernández to an RDIF executive was leaked, complaining about the delays in the delivery of vaccines despite the fact that the Argentine government “did everything possible to make Sputnik V a great success. ”And in which he threatens to “ publicly break the signed contract ”.  
Meanwhile, more than 6 million Argentines who already have their first dose of the Russian vaccine are waiting for the second.  
The unique feature of Sputnik, which has different components for its first and second doses, has made it even more difficult to adhere to the full vaccination schedule.  
The unique feature of Sputnik, which has different components for its first and second doses, has made it even more difficult to adhere to the full vaccination schedule.  
Mexico  
The government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador signed a contract with Russia that included the delivery of 24 million Sputnik V vaccines by the end of May . However, as reported by the site La Silla Rota , at the end of June, a month after the commitment, barely 2,750,000 had been heard.  
In February, 400 thousand doses had to arrive and only 200 thousand were delivered; in March a million vaccines were scheduled, and 700 thousand arrived; by April, the commitment was 6 million doses and only one million arrived; in May, the RDIF had to deliver 16 million vaccines, but only shipped 500,000 doses.  
Thus, at the beginning of this month, 88.5% of the committed vaccines had to be delivered by the end of May. During that month, the Undersecretary of Health, Hugo López-Gatell, had revealed that his country was thinking of switching to Sptnik Light (a version of the single-dose vaccine) due to delays in deliveries and production, especially of the second dose.  
During July, 1,650,000 doses arrived, for a total of 4,400,000 to date.  
Similar to what happened in Argentina, the Mexican laboratory Birmex has signed a contract to produce Sputnik locally, with which it is expected to accelerate deliveries in the coming months.  
But the truth is that so far Mexico has managed to move forward with its vaccination plan thanks to the fact that it has trusted other providers. As of this July 21, he had received 25,791,500 doses of AstraZeneca , 24,201,815 from Pfizer, 16,000,000 from Sinovac, 5,681,140 from Cansino and 1,350,000 from Johnson &amp; Johnson.  
Bolivia  
The government of Luis Arce was another of those that had problems with the provision of Sputnik V. At the end of 2020, it signed a contract that promised to deliver 5,200,000 doses by the middle of this year, but only 1,235,000 arrived.  
The problem was not only the general delay but, as in Argentina, people began to accumulate who had received their first dose and who could not take the second to complete the scheme.  
The latest shipment, received on July 9, included 500,000 first doses and only 27,000 of the second.  
This week the arrival of 200 thousand second doses was expected. But that shipment was suspended without a certain date for its completion.  
When announcing the postponement, the Bolivian government and the Russian embassy in La Paz reported simultaneously that the period between the two doses, which had started at 21 days and then went on to 90 days, could now be extended to 180 days.  
“The period between both vaccines was lengthening. Now we have the information from the Gamaleya Institute and the Russian Investment Fund that can reach half a year, 180 days . It is even possible that the longer the period between the first and second, the greater strength it gains ”, the Russian ambassador to Bolivia, Mikhail Ledenev, tried to calm down, in the company of the Bolivian Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, Benjamin Blanco, That left to clarify the intention of the governments of La Paz and Moscow to preserve their political ties in the midst of the crisis due to the delays in vaccines.",,,,1627166323,{},h6ewi9n,True,t3_oqyt94,False,False,t3_oqyt94,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oqyt94/sputnik_at_fault_delays_complaints_and/h6ewi9n/,1627316756,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

 ""TL;DR: **Yes people in the phase 3 trial got pregnant after vaccination. There was no difference between the rates of pregnancy in the vaccine or placebo groups. No one in the vaccine group had any trouble with their pregnancy over the course of the study**. They also tested it on female rats and did not find any problems, either with fertility or pregnancy.

The Pfizer vaccine FDA report doesn't give a nice summary like this, but they do report 23 people became pregnant during the trial. They report 2 adverse events related to pregnancy, both in the placebo group.

Both companies say they will continue to monitor pregnant people. In general, there is no know reason why a vaccine would affect fertility. I don't believe any ever has before. While mRNA technology is new-ish, it's not so radically different that there would be any reason to believe fertility would be affected. On the other hand, there is growing evidence that covid-19 does affect fertility.""

They’re the “other” type of medical physician recognized by the US other than MDs. Now in the past the quality of education and curriculum in these medical schools was much more Mercola like, but in recent years they’ve adopted essentially the same curriculum as MD schools. These schools don’t tend to be as competitive to get into as MD schools overall, but they’re now teaching the same stuff.

And now they’re so similar that the allopathic (MD) and osteopathic residency training programs are merging. So the real training (residency is the real training doctors get while medical school is sort of the fundamentals to let you do the training) should be largely the same.

It’s during that training that they would choose what to specialize as. So you could have an osteopathic physician who specializes in infections and epidemiology like Fauci and they would be qualified to speak about it.

Mercola however, basically trained back in the days when osteopathic schools were more full of shit basically. So he’s the kind of DO that gives DOs a bad name. I know some good DO physicians, I know some bad DO physicians and the same applies for MDs. Usually US medical school trained MDs *tend* to be better due to the schools having higher entrance requirements (GPA, test score) but there are also plenty of awful MDs who may have gotten good grades in school but are horrible clinicians because they don’t know when to get more info or help when they run into something they’re not as knowledgeable about. The best physicians constantly question their own diagnoses and are constantly learning new things and discussing cases with colleagues to make sure they didn’t miss anything. That doesn’t require an MD from Harvard.

Basically there are good and bad doctors regardless of the degree. Usually residency and fellowship training give you a better clue about how a doctor is anyway but the best way to tell is to have a trusted friend who’s a physician tell you who’s good and who’s not.",,,,1627170197,{},h6f3mu9,False,t3_oqrqe0,False,False,t1_h6e5gbr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oqrqe0/the_most_influential_spreader_of_coronavirus/h6f3mu9/,1627320889,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That said, it’s important to keep an eye on some of the genetic research on the newer strains.  I read a pre-print last week (regrettably I did a quick search and can’t find it), showing that the protein mutations in the newer variants are not only selective for increased viral load or binding affinity within the spike protein (which increase direct transmission), but also for environmental stability in other proteins of the virus outside the spike,  I.E.  potentially longer lasting on surfaces, high humidity or higher temperature environments.

Anecdotally, up until late last year, we had very little evidence of outdoor transmission.  With the delta strain there are several instances with good evidence of outdoor transmission.  So this is something to keep an eye on.

If that weren't true, there wouldnt be a pandemic.  Those numbers were an isolated calculation about themselves.  

The most likely outcome-- you will transmit it to your  50-80 year old moms and dads, auntes, uncles, grandparents who are also  listening to ""warnings"" about the vaccine and didnt get it.

I think there are two basic problems: first, as I said, the education system failed to educate young people about basic biology, how the cells in our bodies work, what they are made of, how the virus replicates and spreads in our bodies, etc. Therefore, young people can't properly educate themselves about this pandemic. Instead, the only way you can explain anything to them is by using general terms. Now, this problem isn't only in young people, but many older people understand that there is a virus, it can harm them or it may even kill them, that's why they take care.

This leads me to the second problem. At the start of the epidemic, the story was this virus kills only the elderly who already suffer from chronic issues. So the young people felt safe and didn't care if they get infected because nothing will happen to them. Then, as the pandemic progressed, we've learned about the effects of long COVID, the virus started mutating, it became more infectious and more deadly. Now the narrative starts shifting and younger people can't understand why they should start caring about a virus that they don't see as a threat.

For example, if you were to segment it thus : 

- 90+
- 80+
- 70+ 
- 60-70
- 40-50
- 20-40
- Under 20

You'd get varying percentages for each group. 

The same applies for Comorbidities. I believe that obese and overweight people's statistics should be seperate from the rest of the population, because it is a huge factor for both the heart and respiratory diseases. 

When you drill down into the numbers, you see that younger people have a much reduced risk, so say you start out at 80% chance of avoiding serious Covid through age, then the double vaccine will add onto that. 

If you're 90 years old and basically borked if you get Covid, then the vaccine is not going to be a 99% avoid death miracle. 

This is what people don't grasp because they take a general number as an absolute. It's fine to generalize of course, but you also have to look at the micro situation. 

So in reality, it's not a 1% of dying for the average person, because the numbers are skewed. 

What we do know so far based on recent numbers:

- where there is a lack of vaccine coverage, the Delta variant is running wild. This is particularly true when you look at vaccinated vs unvaccinated US counties/States

- the AstraZeneca vaccine seems weaker vs Delta variant

- the majority of admissions to the ICU are now unvaccinated young people


All in all, from a functionality perspective, the Pfizer and Moderna jabs are solid, with great protection. 

The issue of the Delta variant is pretty simple : it spreads like wildfire in a dry Californian bush. We now need over 90% herd immunity for it to die out, but with 50% vaccine coverage in the most advanced large nations (USA, France, Germany...) we've ran out of time so there is a new wave.

Can I ask you a question? After covid, I find it hard to walk with both my foot, especially my right. It's been 12 days. (No, I'm not intubated or ICU). I just self-isolate when I had it because the hosp is full (more than full actually). 

For context, where I live (not US) the healthcare system is imploding so there's no chance to see GP at least until the cases is under control (even hospitals are running out of central oxygen - people passed from it). It's that bad. So maybe End of Sept or Early Oct?

That made me self-google'd my own symptoms and I found something like reactive arthritis / charcot foot (which would be awful) / steroid withdrawal syndrome as possible guesses that fits my symptoms.

I'd eventually go to the doctor either way but end of Sept is so far away I just have to ask if you have experience with this.

Have you seen post-covid patients with joint / muscle pain exclusively on their feet and if you do, is it self-limiting (like reactive arthritis-type thing)?

Although the local COVID-19 outbreak is under control and there was only one domestic case with an unknown source, people should not let their guard down as the virus might could surge again, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said at a press briefing.

The 12 domestic cases included six men and six women, aged from their 20s to 70s, who developed symptoms from July 23 to July 24, according to Chen, who heads the CECC.

All of the local cases were reported in the Greater Taipei area, including seven in Taipei and five in New Taipei.

In 10 of the 12 local cases the source of infection has been identified, while one had an unknown infection source and the source of other is still being investigated, according to Chen.

Chen said that while the figures indicate the COVID-19 situation is under control, people should still be careful regardless of whether they have received a COVID-19 vaccine shot or not because the coronavirus could stage a comeback amid the global pandemic.

Of the 14,336 cases reported from May 11 to July 23, 87.6 percent, or 12,555 people, have been discharged from isolation facilities.

The one imported case was a Taiwanese woman in her 60s, who returned from Myanmar on July 11 and received a COVID-19 test prior to ending her quarantine on July 23, the result coming back positive Sunday, according to the CECC.

The new cases bring the total in the country to 15,571, of which 14,098 are domestic infections reported since May 15, when Taiwan first recorded more than 100 COVID-19 cases in a single day.

To date, 786 people have died of COVID-19 in Taiwan, including 774 since May 15.

Of the domestic cases, nine were reported in New Taipei, seven in Taipei, three in Taoyuan, two in Changhua County and one each in Miaoli, Keelung and Taichung, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said at a press briefing.

Although the new cases were spread out among more cities and counties than usual, the number of cases with an unknown source of infection has remained under 10 for more than a week, said Chen, who also heads the CECC.

On Saturday, he said, 17 of the cases had a known source of infection, while only four had no apparent links to other cases, and three were being investigated.

The appearance of 10 cases from unknown sources in a day was one of the criteria the CECC set out in May for imposing a Level 3 COVID-19 alert, though it is unclear whether it will use the same standard when the alert is lowered to Level 2 next week.

Meanwhile, the one imported case was a Taiwanese man in his 20s, who returned from Spain on Thursday and whose mandatory COVID-19 test at the airport came back positive on Saturday, while he was in quarantine.

Taiwan began testing all arriving travelers for COVID-19 earlier this month, roughly a week after it suspended the option of doing the required 14-day quarantine at home, amid fears over the spread of the Delta variant.

The two deaths reported Saturday were both men in their 70s who passed away on July 20 and July 22 respectively, the CECC said.

To date, Taiwan has confirmed a total of 15,558 COVID-19 cases, of which 14,086 are domestic infections reported since May 15, when Taiwan first recorded more than 100 COVID-19 cases in a single day.

The number of deaths from COVID-19 in Taiwan has now risen to 786, all but 12 of which have occurred since May 15.

Also on Saturday, Taipei City released information on locations visited by two recent COVID-19 cases in which the source of infection is still unknown.
One of the patients, the city said, had visited a Carrefour on Chenggong Road in Neihu from 7:31-7:49 a.m. on Wednesday, before testing positive for COVID-19 later that day.

The other individual, who tested positive on Thursday, was at Addiction Aquatic Development seafood restaurant on Minzu East Road from 3:55-4:15 p.m. on July 17, the city's health department said.

As COVID-19 infections have declined in recent weeks, Taipei has increasingly released information on the places COVID-19 patients visited before their diagnosis, if it is believed they may have spread the disease to others.

&gt; The Biden administration now believes that fully vaccinated people who are older or immunocompromised may need a booster shot.

&gt; Though all three vaccines authorized for use in the United States — Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson &amp; Johnson — are highly effective in preventing Covid-19 infections, recent data suggests that the efficacy of Pfizer’s two-dose vaccine can wane slightly four to six months after vaccination, according to the New York Times.

&gt; However, a booster shot could lift antibody levels even more substantially than the current two-dose regimen for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and could be especially beneficial for people 65 and older and those who are immunocompromised.

&gt; People who are immunocompromised may receive significantly less immune protection than the general population after two vaccine doses, increasing the upside of a potential third shot.

&gt; According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee, which met earlier this week to discuss the potential need for booster shots, about 2.7 percent of the US population is currently immunocompromised in some way, whether due to ongoing medical treatment like chemotherapy, their status as organ transplant recipients, or another reason.

&gt; Immunocompromised people are also more likely to become severely ill from Covid-19, and they have a markedly higher chance of experiencing breakthrough infections despite being vaccinated — a concern magnified by a delta variant-fueled resurgence of Covid-19 cases in the US.

UQs vaccine turned didnt get past phase 1 as they triggered HIV false positives. AZ got delayed in getting rollout going initially. Once they did, the blood clotting issue became a thing and media blew it well out of proportion. 

Also with almost 0 covid spread, the independent body determined the risk of the blood clot was greater than the risk of covid and recommended only people above 60 take it. This sent another mixed message as people didn't interpret it right.

They should have never designed it like they did.
How it should have been done: each generation covers its own cost. That way fluctuations in birth rates wouldn't cause such problems.
How it works: You pay your health insurance, it gets reinvested, you pay in as much as anticipated to cover your costs in the future. If medical advances makes it more expensive in the future you'd be confronted with a expense ceiling. (just in case). obviously you can factor in and predict increased living expenses etc so that would rarely happen. (that's basically how insurance companies operate) if it did you'd have a private additional insurance or pay a little cash on top. simple.
Same for pensions.
Instead we got this : unsustainable high pensions get covered by taxes and increased payments that working age people have to pay. These people themselves will never have as high pensions when they get old. they'll also have to rely on the coming generations being able to pay for them.
I actually think it was done this way on purpose knowing what it would mean for later generations, that system ensured past generations could pay very little in pension and health insurance fees and live their luxury lifestyles with fairly low effort.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/21/delta-covid-variant-fauci-says-vaccinated-people-might-want-to-consider-wearing-masks-indoors-.html

&gt;White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said fully vaccinated people might want to consider wearing masks indoors as a precaution against the rapidly spreading delta variant in the U.S.
&gt;“If you want to go the extra mile of safety even though you’re vaccinated when you’re indoors, particularly in crowded places, you might want to consider wearing a mask,” Fauci said in an interview Wednesday with CNBC.

Now, here's the fun part where politics trumps science:

“Mr. Davidovitch said the data was based on hundreds of cases and should only be considered preliminary.”

“The ministry said the latest data might be biased because of where coronavirus tests were conducted. Many were carried out in areas of outbreaks and among the elderly, and only a small number of tests were conducted among younger people who were vaccinated. Older Israelis were the first to be vaccinated; many were fully inoculated by the end of January and currently make up the most of cases of severe illness.”

I’m not saying to ignore that data completely, but it is far too small a sample size, and disproportionately looked at those who are more susceptible to disease than the average population. Even so they claim it’s 91% effective at preventing severe illness, which means that vaccinated aren’t overwhelming healthcare systems and dying in significant numbers.

The US has been a few months behind UK/Europe this entire time but have followed the same trend line throughout. If I can figure that out, why couldn’t the CDC? Honestly, I think there have been multiple public messaging failures by the powers that be in the US, namely that vaccines make you invincible and once you’re vaccinated you can pile into crowded public spaces sans mask and you have absolutely nothing to worry about. And there is NO WAY that genie is going back in the bottle now.

The UK has failed a lot during this but one thing they have gotten right is making it clear that vaccination isn’t some kind of cloak of invincibility and that you still need to be careful. Anecdotally logging onto Instagram these days and seeing my American friends (many of whom are in Texas) going around maskless in big crowds without a care in the world feels sort of like watching a horror movie you’ve seen before hoping the dumb screaming girl decides not to run up the stairs this time.

Again, it is easy to understand how the decisions were made, but we would be foolish to view the decision as inevitable or not awful if we want to do better.

Some people get life extensions like that costing more money than they ever paid into the health insurance in their lifetime. On top of that refugees, unemployed, government employed etc get their health insurance paid by the rest of the population and since their numbers also rise the cost of the health insurance for the rest of the population increases. it becomes harder and harder for young people to make money because it becomes ever more expensive and the peak isn't even nearly reached yet. it's actually impossible to sustain this system. If nothing changes Germany will be a very poor country in a few decades.
You can't have birthrates in the working population whilst their costs keep increasing. Makes working evermore less rewarding. The less money people have the less likely they would plan to get kids.
Its already the case that unemployed with children get more money after taxes than normal people could possibly earn.
I can't actually think of a political correct solution. You'd have to give up something to save the country. You can't pay for refugees with no money and you can't get a birthrate high enough to sustain the pension and health insurance system if you put the increasing costs onto the young working population.
They try to fix it with immigration but they don't do it right because refugees are too costly and would need farrr too many ressources and far too much time to integrate to become able to financially contribute not to mention even the most perfect refugees would prefer sending money home to their in trouble families, further draining the national economy.

My own person thoughts regarding current peer reviewed study on the efficacy of masks:

There is still much to be proven—and—there appears to be some benefit to reducing airborne transmission through droplets by using PPE.

What I ask myself is this… am I willing to risk a greater chance of infection by choosing to believe that masks do not help conclusively?

And…

Which side of “I chose wrong” am I willing to be on?

The answer, for many, has already been decided a long time ago.

No matter what your choice is—be willing to read from both perspectives and do your best to make an informed decision that is free from bias. I acknowledge that the world is confusing, so if it takes us all some time to figure this crap out it’s okay.

Quote from “Biological fluid dynamics of airborne COVID-19 infection”

Q5: Can we offer reliable indications to decision makers about the efficacy of personal protection equipment and measures?

The brief review outlined in Sect. 5 suggests that the WHO guidelines currently adopted for the measures of social distancing needs to be revisited. It emerges clearly that the currently suggested social distancing would require, to be truly effective, the joint use of facial protection tools able to significantly reduce the spreading distance of respiratory exhalations. Furthermore, facial protection devices must be maintained in place when speaking, as speaking is associated with an increase of exhalations. This issue has been reviewed in Sect. 4.2, where it has been emphasized that a verbal exchange is often an occasion of short-distance interaction among asymptomatic infected individuals and susceptible ones. In the absence of facial protection, current knowledge is unable to give binding indications on how to revise current protection criteria. An assessment will require that the open problems mentioned above be satisfactorily addressed.",,,,1627168354,{},h6f09px,False,t3_oqz2av,False,True,t3_oqz2av,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oqz2av/parents_threaten_to_switch_districts_if_mask/h6f09px/,1627318923,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

At the same time, the local vaccine production was very low, and the vaccines weren't that good (I'm pretty sure they were only used a bit at the start of the year, and now aren't available). 

It all became even worse after two people died from blood clots after getting AZ, which lead to some health ministry banning AZ for under 60s while the government was trying to push it for everyone, as they had no other sources. Now tons of AZ have gone to waste or have been given to Indonesia and PNG. We've turned to Pfeizer (which we turned down at the start) and Moderna, which have just started coming in, and thanks to a deal made by one of our former PMs we should be getting more Pfeizer soon, so we can hopefully finally start mass vaccinating people. 

Sure, there was a bit of bad luck with the vaccine rollout, but our government should've done better. The US, Canada and Europe have all managed to vaccine their citizens just fine, while ScoMo and the Liberals have failed. Why didn't we get vaccines from other sources?

Phoenix Suns basketball star Chris Paul, UK health secretary Sajid Javid and US Olympic gymnast Kara Eaker have something in common: they have all tested positive for coronavirus despite being fully vaccinated.No vaccine is 100 per cent effective, so what scientists call “breakthrough infections” were always expected. In most cases, the symptoms are mild.However, as a new surge in Covid-19 cases has collided with a global vaccination campaign delivering more than 200m shots a week, more people are asking: “How protected am I?”

&amp;#x200B;

**How many fully vaccinated people are testing positive?**

&amp;#x200B;

While anecdotal accounts of breakthrough infections can make such cases feel widespread, the real numbers have remained small and were generally in line with expectations, experts said.“There’s no such thing as a perfect vaccine . . . with Covid it’s no different,” said Professor William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University.The yellow fever jab, for example, is widely understood to be the most effective live-virus vaccine ever invented, with a single dose generating long-lasting immunity in 98 per cent of those vaccinated. But even that means that on average 2 per cent of people will still get infected.Phase 3 trials for most of the leading Covid-19 jabs showed an efficacy against symptomatic infection of more than 90 per cent. Real-world studies of effectiveness in the UK, Israel and Canada suggest that vaccines are displaying a slightly lower effectiveness outside of the trial environment, probably because of the spread of the more vaccine-resistant Delta variant. Estimates put protection against symptomatic infection, depending on the vaccine, at between 60-90 per cent.According to Public Health England, about 17 per cent of the 105,598 Delta variant cases reported across England in the four weeks to July 19 were among fully vaccinated people. PHE counts people as fully vaccinated 14 days after their second dose.Anthony Masters, a member of the UK’s Royal Statistical Society, said fully vaccinated people were likely to make up a “bigger proportion” of cases as vaccine coverage was extended, particularly in younger groups who face a higher exposure risk because of greater social mixing.“If you get extremely high coverage across the different ages, it’s plausible that cases could become \[in\] majority among fully vaccinated people,” he said. About 55 per cent of the UK population had received both doses by July 21.In Israel, where nearly 60 per cent of the population are fully vaccinated and coverage is spread more evenly across age cohorts, 52 per cent of about 6,000 people who tested positive in the week to July 21 were fully vaccinated.

&amp;#x200B;

**Are some fully vaccinated people at more risk of falling ill than others?**

&amp;#x200B;

Very few fully vaccinated people who test positive for Covid-19 are getting seriously ill. According to PHE’s real-world studies, the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is still 96 per cent effective against hospitalisation, while the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot is 92 per cent effective.But Natalie Dean, a biostatistics professor at Emory University in Atlanta, stressed that these figures were averages and that efficacy depended on people’s existing risk profiles. “Everything is relative when it comes to vaccines and risk,” she said.A Financial Times analysis of global infection fatality rates, for example, suggests that a double-jabbed 80-year-old now faces about the same mortality risk as an unvaccinated 50-year-old. *Chart showing that vaccines have made Covid-19 far less lethal. A fully-vaccinated 80-year-old now has the same mortality risk as an unvaccinated 50-year-old*In England, where the vaccine rollout has been staggered from oldest to youngest and nine in 10 over-50s have been fully vaccinated, 30 per cent of the 1,788 people admitted to hospital because of the Delta variant in the four weeks to July 19 were fully vaccinated. About half of the 460 deaths in the country linked to the Delta strain since February were people who were also fully immunised.“This is simply a reflection of vaccine uptake being very high among older people,” said Masters. “It’s perversely a marker of \[a\] successful rollout. If everyone \[was\] fully vaccinated, everyone who went to hospital or died would by definition be fully vaccinated.”About two-thirds of people who die on UK roads are wearing a seatbelt, but this is a consequence of usage rates of nearly 99 per cent, Masters said. He added that the same logic applied to severe disease and death in highly vaccinated populations.Vanderbilt’s Schaffner added that people who experienced unpleasant but mild symptoms would probably have suffered severe disease, or even death, had they not been vaccinated. “Whenever my patients tell me they still had a mild illness despite vaccination, I always say I’m glad you’re still here to complain.”*Chart showing why a high proportion of double-jabbed people among hospitalisations does not mean the vaccines are failing. When a very high share of people are fully vaccinated, a large share of cases and hospitalisations will be double-jabbed people despite the vaccines working very well. When a lower share are fully vaccinated, the double-jabbed are a smaller share of cases and hospitalisations, but far more people end up in hospital overall.*

**Can you test how protected you are?**

&amp;#x200B;

Not yet. The easiest way to understand how much immunity the vaccine has generated in a person is to measure the presence of neutralising antibodies in the blood. But T cells and B cells, which supplement the body’s immune system, also play a role and scientists remain unclear about which benchmarks offer the best insight into the vaccine’s effectiveness.Commercially available antibody tests only show whether an individual has Covid-linked antibodies or not, but immunity is best understood as a “scale or continuum”, explained Danny Altmann, an immunology professor at Imperial College London. “It’s not binary. You’re not safe or unsafe, protected or not protected. People all have varying degrees of protection from the vaccine.”This range of immunity can be plotted with a test called a neutralisation assay, which analyses how many times antibodies taken from the blood can be diluted in a laboratory and still neutralise the virus.At the extremes, immunocompromised people may only generate enough antibodies to weather a 100-fold dilution, Altmann said. In comparison, healthy young people may have enough for a 10,000-fold dilution and are “likely impervious” to infection.If scientists were able to establish the midpoint between the two extremes, Altmann said “vaccine makers would be able to update vaccines quicker for new variants and policymakers could better determine which people are in most need of booster doses”.What do imperfect vaccines mean for herd immunity?Kit Yates, a mathematical biologist at Bath university, warned that the imperfect protection offered by the vaccine against infection meant herd immunity could be “impossible” without vaccine uptake of above 90 per cent.“Leaky vaccines probably put herd immunity out of reach, especially when faced with \[the\] Delta \[variant\],” he said.*Chart showing that without vaccines, England’s daily Covid hospital admissions would already be above the winter peak*Adam Kucharski, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that with the UK anticipating in excess of 100,000 cases a day by late August, the implications of imperfect vaccines “will soon become clear”.PHE estimates that on average the Covid-19 vaccines being used in the UK are between 91 and 97 per cent effective in preventing hospitalisation.Kucharski warned that small differences could have a big effect on how much this wave of infections stretches the British healthcare system. “If you flip the number, you’re left with how ineffective the vaccines are and 9 per cent ineffective rather than 3 per cent ineffective means three times more hospitalisations.”",,,,1627184717,{},h6fsqwq,False,t3_or4153,False,True,t3_or4153,/r/Coronavirus/comments/or4153/why_are_fully_vaccinated_people_testing_positive/h6fsqwq/,1627336196,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Flu ranked 7th, having a resurgance out of season thanks to almost 18 months of continued and prolonged wearing of facemasks, lowering immune system responses. Check it out.

&gt; Vaccination was highly effective with overall estimated efficacy for documented infection of 92·8% (CI:[92·6, 93·0]); hospitalization 94·2% (CI:[93·6, 94·7]); severe illness 94·4% (CI:[93·6, 95·0]); and death 93·7% (CI:[92·5, 94·7]). Similarly, the overall estimated level of protection from prior SARS-CoV-2 infection for documented infection is 94·8% (CI:[94·4, 95·1]); hospitalization 94·1% (CI:[91·9, 95·7]); and severe illness 96·4% (CI:[92·5, 98·3]). Our results question the need to vaccinate previously-infected individuals.

OP article doesn’t go into the possibilities, but is more specific stating steroid treatments is the issue. 

&gt;Less commonly, cancer patients, organ-transplant recipients, and people treated with high doses of immunity-damping drugs called corticosteroids (steroids), developed this disease too. The links between diabetes and the fungal infection are manifold. Diabetes raises glucose and iron in the blood, both of which Mucorales feed on. Also, when a diabetic patient suffers a complication called ketoacidosis, their blood becomes acidic, while their immune system takes a hit, again creating favourable conditions for infection (See accompanying article). Steroids acts along similar lines to trigger mucormycosis, by spiking blood sugar, and depressing the immune system.
Two studies conducted during the pandemic suggest that steroids were the main reason behind the massive jump in mucormycosis during 2020 and 2021. Both found that a large proportion of mucormycosis patients were diabetic. This was expected, because it was true even before the pandemic. But they also found that an equally large proportion of patients were treated with steroids for covid.
Steroid prescriptions, in fact, had jumped through the roof in the last two years. Even though they are a recommended treatment for moderate covid, doctors were often prescribing them for mild covid, and in unnecessarily high doses—a reflection of the panic the pandemic engendered all around.
But the steroids explanation doesn’t fully solve the puzzle. Several experts point out that while covid did push up steroid use, this isn’t the first time it has happened in India. And yet, India never saw such a large epidemic of the fungal pathogen before. For instance, Indian doctors treat several other respiratory diseases, including influenza, with steroids, says Ashwin Rajenesh, an internal medicine specialist at Kollam’s NS Memorial Institute of Medical Sciences. Yet, influenza season, which occurs every year, doesn’t coincide with mucormycosis outbreaks. “What we see is uncommon and unusual, to say the least,"" Rajenesh says. He and several doctors believe that it’s not just the treatment for covid, but covid itself that is making patients biologically vulnerable to Mucorales.
&gt;And there is some emerging evidence for this idea—preliminary studies show that covid can raise blood sugar in some patients, triggering a diabetes-like condition. Chakrabarti and his team are pursuing this hypothesis in two new studies, and some results may be out later this year. But if this hypothesis pans out, this won’t be the first time a new viral disease also created a susceptible host for a fungus.",,,,1627218985,{},h6gyrw1,False,t3_oqqrjn,False,True,t1_h6doalf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oqqrjn/india_records_more_than_45000_cases_of_black/h6gyrw1/,1627358530,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Since at least May of this year, various venues have required you to have tested negative in the last 24 hours, or to be fully vaccinated + 15 days, or to have a certificate of recovery from the last 6 months to access them – these include gyms, the indoor areas of restaurants, cinemas, etc. Antigen tests are accepted as a negative test and are paid for by the state (to avoid resentment among the population that was not able to get prompt access to the vaccine). In response, independent, privately run test centres have sprung up everywhere in large cities (in closed down bakeries, former nail studios, and even just in tents outside busy restaurants, to give just a few examples from my local area). These offer the free (government paid) antigen tests and self-paid PCR tests for people who need them for travel. Typically, you just show up at the centre, fill out a form (that includes your personal details and email address), go in and have your nose poked, and 20 minutes later, you get a message or email with your result. You can then either download the PDF with your test result (which comes with an official state letterhead) or sometimes even import it in to the government's CoronaWarn app, and then show it anywhere that needs a test. The option to import it into CoronaWarn is actually pretty cool, because it shows how many hours you still have left on your current test – i.e. ""Current test still valid for 3 hours and 40 mins"". But before taking this test, you usually have to click a box asserting that you do not have symptoms of Covid.

By contrast, if you thought you actually had coronavirus, you would not go to one of these test centres and not take an antigen test – you would call your local Covid practice (a doctor's office specialising in offering Covid diagnosis), get an appointment there, and go and get a PCR test. This would also be free (because your public health insurance would pay for it).

The suggestion here is not to make people pay for PCR tests at their local Covid practice if they think they have Covid – it is to make people pay 10 EUR at the private test centres if they want an antigen test to go to the gym. After all, by September at the latest, everyone who wants to be fully vaccinated will be fully vaccinated – as of today 49% of all Germans are fully vaccinated and 60% have the first dose. Any adult who is not fully vaccinated by mid-September likely did not want to be vaccinated ...  

And no, I do not think that people would fake having COVID symptoms to get a free PCR test at a COVID practice, because these usually take longer than 24 hours to return the results, which would negate the whole reason for taking the test.",,,,1627218775,{},h6gyfz8,False,t3_or8ibn,False,False,t1_h6gsdrw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/or8ibn/germanys_chancellery_minster_vaccinated_people/h6gyfz8/,1627358355,125,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Not to mention that anyone who's really rich and not just a very well paid employee, has a business or something of the sort where you cant effectively change tax income by increasing taxation. That's because you can always just buy more assets with your earnings or get more company cars or whatever to keep your official earnings very low or at zero. And you can't pay taxes on no earnings. that's why nearly all of the tax income is income tax on employees and then the sales tax.
You'd have to entirely change the taxation system to extract more from rich people. That being said it would just create more problems and reduce everyone's wealth quite a lot, you definitely don't want high taxes in a society, taxes are a very inefficient way of using ressources.
Tax the rich higher has always just been a purely political thing, in the past in the USA they had extremely high tax rates on the rich, the poor loved it, the rich were indifferent, they simply used all the purposely existing tax loopholes and the things i mentioned above about reinvesting. It actually reduced the USAs tax income as the rich became more proficient at dodging taxes and it became less attractive to take money out of your own business to pay yourself as the owner a wage.
For example if i had a business and i made 1 million in earnings i could either pay out a dividend to myself or a wage. If you tax my business 50% then ill have half a million of which I'd pay income taxes as well so I'd have less than a quarter million left. Alternatively i pay myself a dividend and pay the business tax plus capital gains taxes.
In any case I'd really want to avoid doing that. If it were 20% business tax id be more inclined to do so, dodging taxes is costly in itself id need to pay someone to help me.
So taxing the rich more = not more tax income, rich don't really want to stay in your country, and if you suceeded  getting taxes higher via for example a wealth tax aka taxing on what you own, you'd still just hurt the efficiency of your economy and you'd end up with a system where taxes are highest when birthrate s are lowest and lowest when they are highest, which is extremely counter productive and just increases the problems.
What you'd want is higher taxes on high birthrates and lower taxes on low birthrates. but you can't do that either because you also need the taxrates adjusted to match economic cycles and to manage inflation.
And that's why you shouldn't listen to regular people talk about economics. it's way too complicated, only few people who are professionally involved are worth listening to. Personally i study this stuff plus learn additional things on top of it out of personal interest and to become a better investor.

&gt; Overall, the likelihood of household transmission was approximately 40 to 50% lower in households of index patients who had been vaccinated 21 days or more before testing positive than in households of unvaccinated index patients; the findings were similar for the two vaccines. 

Central estimates were a 48% lower likelihood of household transmission for those who tested positive after AZ vaccination, 46% for Pfizer. Put another way, that’s 46-48% less transmission *given that the individual had a breakthrough case*. The *overall* suppression of household transmission will of course be much higher, since the vaccines are highly effective at preventing infection in the first place.

The impact on non-household transmission may be slightly more complex due to possible behavioural factors related to asymptomatic cases as you point out, plus isolation requirements rendering the reduction in infectious period less helpful outside of household settings, etc.

Footnote: 93% of those vaccinated in the dataset had only had one dose – the reduction in onward transmission is likely to be even larger for those who have had two doses.

As most of the risk groups in the U.K. are now protected by vaccination, fewer people are expected to die from a Delta variant infection.

Some takeaways: 

- *If you are vaccinated*, you shouldn't be ""excessively worried.""

-  *If you are vaccinated*, covid is--to you--what the covid deniers incorrectly claimed it was last year.  It is a risk comparable to the flu. 

This is from the head of the Brown University School of Public Health---hardly a covid denier.

That's not exactly how vaccines work. It protects you from getting deathy ill, it protects you from experiencing symptom's so bad you need to be put on a ventilator, it helps your body learn to produce antibodies to fight the virus

**You can still get covid. You can still spread covid. You can still experience mild symptoms. So far, the chance of it is extremely small if you're fully vaccinated but this virus is and continues to mutate into variants and the more variants, the more evasive a disease**

If you're fully vaccinated, theoretically you should be free to go on a cruise. You know you're 100% vaccinated but what about the man sitting next to you at dinner? All those children at Disney anything under 12, we know for a fact aren't vaccinated yet. Do you 100% trust everyone around you? Especially right now when there are people proudly stating on social media ""I'm not vaccinated and never will be, but Disney don't need to know that.""

It really is coming down to everyone's individual risk/reward analysis. Is the cruise worth it?

I think the authorities find themselves painted in to a corner as far as being honest about breakthrough cases. If you get infected and have the sniffles or even flu-like symptoms for a few days, that's not a societal problem. But we've been obsessing over case counts (many of whom aren't even sick but are only detected due to the mass testing protocols) for the last year and a half. So people's thinking has gotten pretty fucked up about illness.


If they go back to how they looked and counted illness in 2019 then they could be honest about the breakthrough cases because mild illness doesn't really matter. You get sick, you stay home and rest, and you recover.

I replied to a comment yesterday about how we still needed to be wearing masks because although we have a lower chance, vaccinated people can still catch and spread COVID. I got downvoted. I just saw a post on how someone got vaccinated, but still got it and then spread it to their family members, who were also vaccinated. The only 100% with the vaccine is it makes it to where you don't have a severe case. Plus of course there's the Delta variant and the knowledge that it's more contagious than the original variant, as well as the lower efficy/effectiveness rates to the original varient for vaccinated people from recent studies, there are still people who cannot get vaccinated for medical reasons, and we're still waiting on children under 12 to be vaccinated. People seem to think that the vaccine is this invisibility cloak so they don't need to worry about it anymore. The CDC doing the mask recommendation definitely did not help. The attitude now is that we've put up with this for over a year, we've been trying to do the right thing by doing everything we can to slow the spread, so I should be rewarded for that by doing what I did before since now I'm safe from going into the hospital and dying. I understand that thought process, and yeah you can now do what you did before without fearing that you'll die, but they seem to be conveniently forgetting that we are still in a pandemic, the Delta variant is still powerful, and I think it's safe to say that we're going to be in this for at least the rest of the year due to the amount of people who won't get vaccinated. The last time I checked the reason we were trying to take all the precautions against COVID is because we didn't want to catch it and then subsequently have us/somebody else die from contracing it. Wear your masks in high traffic/populated areas (work, grocery stores, department stores, concerts, and sporting events being the most important imo) where you cannot be certain that people are vaccinated so if you do on the off chance catch COVID, you will not then spread it to someone who has not been able to be vaccinated for medical reasons or spread it to a kid under 12, who can get sick and spread it to someone else, because now that's the major thing vaccinated people need to keep in mind.",,,,1627242235,{},h6i8sgk,False,t3_orb6od,False,False,t1_h6hw205,/r/Coronavirus/comments/orb6od/many_americans_were_looking_forward_to_a_carefree/h6i8sgk/,1627381600,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Based on the antibody levels of the 16-24 and 25-34 age groups, taking into account vaccination rates, this is about 30-40%. So 70% of population with antibodies from vaccination, the majority of which are double vaccinated, many of which have antibodies from natural infection, some with both, plus an additional 9-12% who have immunity from natural infection gives the UK a total population immunity of about 79-82%. 

If we want to consider full immunity then 55% are fully vaxxed, approximately 5-7% have been infected and single dosed, 9-13% have been infected but not vaxxed, for a total of 69-75% have equivalent protection to full vaccination. You could also consider that single doses do still have 30-70% efficacy, with the higher end more likely for younger people, call it 50% to be conservative, which would bump these numbers up to 74-79%.

These are likely a slight underestimate because we've been having high case rates recently and it takes time for antibodies to show up.

That's not the case in Israel. By the end of February, 39% of the population was fully vaccinated, which is about 55-60% of adults. So they would have been vaccinating plenty of people in their 30s and 40s by then.

&gt;Did they account for this?

It seems like they accounted for this, as they broke down the difference between Jan/Feb vaccination vs March and later vaccination by age groups:

&gt;In his study, the apparent waning effect in immunity was felt across all ages. For all age groups, early vaccinators were 1.95 times more likely to be confirmed coronavirus positive. Among those aged 60-plus, early vaccinators are twice as likely to get infected. For those aged 40-59 early vaccinators are 2.1 times more vulnerable, and among under 39s they are 1.6 more likely to catch the coronavirus.

Now that doesn't mean there aren't confounding variables. Perhaps younger people vaccinated by the end of February are more likely to be exposed (health care workers, teachers, etc.) than ones vaccinated later, but if that was driving this then you'd think this effect would have been seen the entire time, and not just in the last month or so.",,,,1627241948,{},h6i8721,False,t3_orfkcy,False,False,t1_h6hz19h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/orfkcy/hmo_those_who_inoculated_early_twice_as_likely_to/h6i8721/,1627381294,17,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

“Our numbers are the highest in the world,” the head of the Indonesian Pediatric Society, Dr. Aman Bhakti Pulungan, said of the death rate. “Why are we not giving the best for our children?” The jump in child deaths coincides with the surge of the Delta variant, which has swept through Southeast Asia, where vaccination rates are low, causing record outbreaks not only in Indonesia, but in Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar and Vietnam as well. 

Indonesia, the world’s fourth-most populous nation, this month overtook India and Brazil in the number of daily cases, becoming the new epicenter of the pandemic. The government reported nearly 50,000 new infections and 1,566 deaths among the entire population on Friday.""

I'm doing nothing of the kind, of course. People should definitely get vaccinated, as I have said over and over.

However, it's becoming clear that there are limits to a strategy based on vaccinations and nothing else, which seems to be the strategy that the US and European countries have been pursuing. This has to do with the number of factors:

* New variants of the virus which are much more virulent and which the vaccines are less effective against.

* Slower-than-hoped uptake of the vaccines in the population and low vaccination rates in most of the world's nations (we are at something like 12% globally now). 

* Abandonment of other measures like masks and social distancing, and the foolish resumption of risky activities like opening bars and nightclubs, operating venues at full capacity, and reopening schools even though the school-age population remains and vaccinated.

We have our summer camp at the same school district, so while school shouldn't be an imminent issue for us at the moment, it unfortunately is. And when I messaged the person who ran the camp a few days before it started to ask about mask policy, specifically because Delta was inevitably coming and I was concerned, the big-wig head of the program wrote me that ""because the camp is taking place at the school, we're following regulations for the school and masks will be required indoors but not outdoors."" (I'm putting it more nicely than he did, since he gave me a fucking attitude for asking a simple question.) One week after camp started, the guidance changed, so we have to deal with this shit not only when school starts but all summer too. Last year, our numbers during the summer were, at most, 65 a day. Now they're 150. I am truly concerned for the winter numbers, especially during Christmastime. This never had to be this way, and while I could say ""the numbers are all the unvaccinated, so they deserve what they get,"" my kid is a) too young to be vaccinated, and b) among those who could pass it on to us (we're both vaccinated, but apparently if you followed the rules and got vaccinated 3 weeks later, you're less protected against Delta than if you had procrastinated). So, I agree - it's incredibly upsetting and frustrating that these asshole parents don't give enough of a shit about their kids or other people to encourage them to wear a mask, which most certainly does not ""hinder their development.""

Even if Covid were just like the flu… I don’t want it.

But yeah, it’s far worse than the flu. Those that I know who got it were severely sick for weeks. A few of them were hospitalized, and a few others had to have nurses stop by their homes to give them oxygen.

*No!* The truth is, however uncomfortable it may be, that we simply aren't going back to brunch! An event with such a grand impact on history isn't just something we can clean up and forget about for all of eternity; we must seize the opportunity to educate ourselves and ask what valuable lessons we can learn. When we ""live with the virus"", we mean *resuming a semblance of normality albeit on higher alert, with personal precautions like social distancing, event cancellations, increased sanitation, and mask usage encouraged more, all while implementing legal mandates in areas and times where they are necessary (NOT on the same scale as 2020, of course).* It's fair to say that there's definitely going to be *some* significant degree of change, whether for the better or worse.

**Life changes,** and this is something we all must come to recognize. The definition of ""old normal"" varies between person to person: different people have different degrees of risk tolerance, certain individuals might just like sanitizing things, there are extroverts and introverts, and some people might have even worn masks before 2020 for reasons unrelated to the current pandemic.

Brazilian town experiment shows mass vaccination can wipe out COVID-19

&amp;#x200B;

As part of an unusual experiment to track the real-world   
effectiveness of CoronaVac, a COVID-19 vaccine made by a Chinese   
company, almost all adult residents of Serrana, in the state of São   
Paulo, received the required two shots between February and April, long   
before most would otherwise have become eligible for the vaccine. The   
results were dramatic. Symptomatic cases of COVID-19 have dropped by 80%  
 since the start of mass vaccination, related hospitalizations fell 86%,  
 and deaths plummeted 95%, the research team in charge of the experiment  
 reported during a press conference yesterday.",,,,1627236801,{},h6hxkdo,False,t3_orbcaq,False,True,t3_orbcaq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/orbcaq/as_delta_surges_bay_area_reaches_realization_that/h6hxkdo/,1627375986,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You are right about the labor part but you are wrong about how much the labor part matters. (not to mention that labor can be transfered globally so its really hard to run out as long as you outbid others) The current system can end up putting so much load on one single worker that he has to bring in taxes equivalent to &gt;100% of what he earns to cover it.
Printing money to cover costs is a short term thing, it doesn't create value, it thins out the value of everything to the benefit of the government at loss to everyone else.
You can transfer money over time very easily though. For example if the government didn't health insure and force pension payments onto everyone, each person individually would have to pay for their own pension, in such a scenario the elderly could outnumber the working population 100:1 and yet taxes wouldn't have to be increased. 
In the current system that one guy would have to feed 100 elderly people with his sole work output.

An interesting thing to me is that there are many countries that have achieved extremely low covid rates even in the absence of any vaccine. Australia comes to mind, and Vietnam until recently.  There are certainly others. So there seem to be good ways to keep the virus from spreading that don't rely on every single person immediately flocking to get vaccines, which at this point seems like it's not happening.

None of that requires actually being able to read scientific papers.  Just hearing an explanation of the (rigorous) process and that the vaccine was borne out of such a rigorous process suffices.  This is what is generally meant by understanding science, or trusting evidence-based reputable research.

It’s not mystifying anything, but if you insist so, then similarly wherever you end your desire to read and scrutinize is where the mystification begins.

Frankly it is too much to ask of people, and only opens them up being misinformed with information they aren’t accustomed to making sense of.  People flexing their “healthy skepticism” of scientists leads them down a rabbit hole of self-affirming conspiracies.

Come to Germany and live as a foreigner student and you will understand how different and difficult the bureaucracy is. Obviously I have learnt a lot throughout the years. But 'getting letters' isnt an issue just in my case. It's something all foreigner students face here.

You have to register your new address in 14 days after you move to a new place. But some cities have such huge waiting times that it can take up to 6 months to get an appointment. But since you are registered at a different address, all your letters would be sent there. But you name in your older address would be removed and so either your letters wouldn't be delivered or it will be thrown into garbage. So after 6 months when I do my registration for the new address, I will get letter directed there with more fines. For certain things like I can personally change my address easily (bank, university), for something you just cannot.

Back in 2014 my dad died and my residence permit was already expired as I got appointment after 6 months and when I was at the airport the security didn't let me leave as I had appointment confirmation only as email, but not on paper with stamp. But the city I live in gives only email appointment. Even the police couldn't get in touch with the immigration office, as they are literally only reachable via email.

Given with what had happen in Israel, it's no surprise that people would not be eager to get the vaccine.

The Health minister had lied about the vaccine they had said it was approved by the FDA , Pfizer had given several 28 millions ILS to the dr association members (there's a claim that one of the ones who approved had worked for Pfizer). 

Claim had been limited by 250K ILS for all damages, if person sues he can only sue once and he is obligated to prove damage was because of the vaccine and even that AFTER he get disability ranking.   


All medical expenses are on the person who got the vaccine - I know first hand a person who now pays for each MD to visit his house which is 250 ILS per appointment and he also need to cover the meds and can not work for the next three weeks (he is one one the very few who got cardio problems post the second dose).   


If a person leave in Tel Aviv , and has covered full medical insruance he should be covered, if you live outside like in Tveria you are about to pay 400ILS to go to T.V (Taxi + M.D visit). Many minimum wage don't have the insurance that cover the special M.D (we had helped a friend who had to pay 750 ILS to see a cardiologist in his town).

Illness does seem to develop more quickly than with prior strains, but there’s nothing concrete just yet regarding potential severity. 

&gt; “The Delta variant is more aggressive and much more transmissible than previously circulating strains,” Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a White House briefing on Thursday. “It is one of the most infectious respiratory viruses we know of and that I have seen in my 20-year career.”

…

&gt; Other evidence suggests that the variant may be able to partially evade the antibodies made by the body after a coronavirus infection or vaccination. And the variant may also render certain monoclonal antibody treatments less effective, the C.D.C. notes.

…

&gt; But much is still unknown or unproven, including whether this variant may cause more severe illness. A recent Scottish study, for instance, found that people infected by the Delta variant were roughly twice as likely to be hospitalized as those infected with Alpha. More research and data are needed to assess its effects in comparison to those of other variants.

&gt; “The severe disease piece I think is the one question that really hasn’t been answered yet,” Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said last month.

[source](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/22/health/delta-variant-covid.html?referringSource=articleShare)

More reading: 

&gt; A new study in the journal Nature found that the viral load, a measure of the density of viral particles in the body, is roughly 1,000 times higher in people infected with the Delta variant than those infected from previous versions of the coronavirus. “Putting it all together, Delta’s really difficult to stop,” Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong who was not involved in the study, told Nature.

[source](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/07/covid-b-1-617-2-delta-variant-what-we-know.html)

And another: 

&gt; In a preprint posted 12 July1, the researchers report that virus was first detectable in people with the Delta variant four days after exposure,compared with an average of six days among people with the original strain, suggesting that Delta replicates much faster. Individuals infected with Delta also had viral loads up to 1,260 times higher than those in people infected with the original strain.

&gt; The combination of a high number of viruses and a short incubation period makes sense as an explanation for Delta’s heightened transmissibility, says epidemiologist Benjamin Cowling at the University of Hong Kong. The sheer amount of virus in the respiratory tract means that superspreading events are likely to infect even more people, and that people might begin spreading the virus earlier after they become infected.

It's not believing one data set and not believing another. Both are likely correct and they are both measuring different things. We need to pay close attention to data from Israel, not outright dismiss it. Everyone was fine with their data until it said something they don't want to hear.

[I've got this.](https://www.medicaldaily.com/effects-alcohol-binge-drinking-breathing-problems-393437)


&gt; A new study, published in the journal Chest, reveals the first **link between excessive alcohol consumption and nitric oxide levels** — a naturally produced gas **that helps fight bacterial infections in the lungs**. **Study participants who had lower levels of the gas were also the excessive drinkers**, while those who never drank had higher levels of nitric oxide. The more a participant reported drinking, the lower their levels, which told researchers that their bodies were less equipped to kill bacteria and fight off lung infections.

But that's bacteria and infection, not my OG claim.

[So, to the study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/08/160801142051.htm)! 

Who did they count?

&gt; The Loyola researchers examined data from 12,059 adults who participated in NHANES between 2007 and 2012.** Excessive drinkers were defined as heavy drinkers (more than one drink per day on average for women and more than two drinks per day for men) and people who binge drink at least once per month** (four or more drinks per occasion for women and five or more drinks for men).

And what did they find?

&gt; ""Alcohol appears to disrupt the healthy balance in the lung,"" said lead author Majid Afshar, MD, MSCR. Dr. Afshar is a Loyola Medicine pulmonologist and an assistant professor in the division of pulmonary and critical care medicine and department of public health sciences of Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine.

So no, I can't quite show an easy link between plain ole binge drinking and too much extra breath, just research that points to OTHER conditions that alcohol exacerbates breathing in, like anemia. 

So do people overall breath heavier if they're drinking?

Whether this makes sense or not depends on who you are and why you are masking, though.

Cloth masks work just about as well to protect others.

If you are masking to protect yourself, then an N95 is your best bet, but a surgical mask is substantially better than cloth.

I can imagine many--especially younger, lower risk--vaccinated people aren't worried, so will wear cloth where required (and potentially nothing where there is no requirement).

Some vaccinated people might be worried and want to protect themselves, but not badly enough to wear an N95, which is both more expensive and much less comfortable.  These people might choose a surgical mask.

Finally, vaccinated people who want maximum protection and are okay with being much less comfortable will choose N95s.

This time a month ago: 498 cases/day.

This time last week: 11,000 cases/day.

Most recent number: 5,000 cases/day.

Why this doesn't add up is the sheer speed in the upward direction, the upturn coincided with Delta becoming dominant, but the speed implies that R was very high, and therefore there was a lot of people lacking immunity. But if that were the case, then how the hell have cases fallen so fast? I know they've reintroduced some measures, but we've seen in other places how tough you have to be with Delta to regain any control. If R was so high for explosive growth one week, masks alone shouldn't halve cases the following week.

So it looks nothing like herd immunity, and looks nothing like moderate mitigation measures.

What else could it be?

The weather? Not likely, cases are growing in Germany and Belgium (very slowly) as well as France (quite a bit faster). The only immediate neighbour (well, across the sea) with declining cases is the UK, but the UK has had increasing cases (predominantly Delta) for three months so is in a different situation entirely.
