Two weeks is barely enough time for those infected at the event to start showing up at the hospital (incubation time + some time sick before needing hospital care).

Of course, those extra cases go on to infect others, but that will have more to do with the general effective R in the community: if everyone infected in Florida now infects 0.8 people on average, the extra cases added won't do much, but if they infected 1.1 people, it would add to cases over time - but that average is decreasing with vaccinations, so hard to say how many.

Whether adding up to some hundreds of cases now is worth the joy from the event can be debated.

\- Pfizer and Moderna have [80%](https://www.asbmb.org/asbmb-today/science/040421/how-effective-is-the-first-shot-of-the-pfizer-or-m) protection with one dose for at least a few months. I highly doubt this protection would just drop off.

\- If you had Covid already you have about [80%](https://www.contagionlive.com/view/denmark-study-covid-19-patients-80-percent-protected-reinfection) protection for at least six months. (I have seen other studies putting it higher)

We're dealing with variants that are known to be more highly contagious.

Add in the fact that a fair number of 60+ people have been vaccinated, and it kinda makes sense that you'd be seeing a shift towards younger patients becoming hospitalized.

Not far from these shelters is beautiful luxury housing which sits empty as an investment vehicle for people who gave more money than they know what to do with. The median income is not enough to rent a studio apartment in most of the city. People live in crowded arrangements, often with roommates as adults. The pause on evictions will end at some point, and all of this will get much worse.

We have three generations of people who enter the job market with at least a downpayment on a house worth of high interest debt, if not a whole house. Most of them will never pay it off, and will have a several hundred dollar a month bill in perpetuity. In a few more years we will have a fourth generation. The price of not taking on this debt is generally to be unqualified to get a non minimum wage job.

The economic impact of the virus will amplify all of this. The current administration is trying to mitigate it, but is limited to bandaids because their party’s ties to capital prevent them from supporting the necessary changes.

The claim: A new Pentagon microchip can tell if you have COVID-19

Our rating: Partly false

The claim that a sensor developed by Pentagon scientists is a microchip with an antenna that can detect COVID-19 is PARTLY FALSE, based on our research. The sensor is not a microchip, as it's inert and doesn't have any metal that could relay personal information to other devices. And it was developed by a private company, though using federal funding. The chip also doesn't directly detect COVID-19, but it can relay information about changes in molecules that could indicate the presence of COVID-19 or other diseases. ""

Gala was expected to be sent home this week from Beaumont Royal Oak. His brother-in-law, who caught the virus around the same time, died a few days ago at another hospital.

Gala still wonders when and how he caught the virus.

Vaccines are out of the question. They require 1-2 months to take effect assuming ad absurdum that DE will just take doses away from their own people, ship them to IN tomorrow &amp; IN will magically distribute them in the blink of an eye.  

Ventilators (the kind that requires intubation) are pretty much useless. I'm from Romania. We are 2nd world in terms of health care. There are a lot of hospitals in RO where fatality rate for those who need to be intubated is 90%+. There are lots of ICUs where doctors are ultra-depressed because they have RARELY seen someone recover once they are intubated. In the West fatality rate is ~40% for those who are intubated. The difference comes from the quality of health care. How much prompt attention &amp; intervention is given to such a critical patient makes the difference between 4 out of 10 dead vs. 9+ out of 10 dead. You can't ship quality health care to India so that's also out of the question.

Finally, O2 is the most important concrete item that's missing in their hospitals but that's prohibitively expensive to ship. It needs to be manufactured on-site and hospitals either have the necessary installations or not. You can't just ship O2 to India in any amounts that will make a difference.

It's like one of those on-again, off-again romance movies where it's totally obvious but they keep missing each other.

Fauci takes a hard line requiring scientific evidence for certain things but then makes other recommendations where there is no scientific backing. He says he has to see the evidence before finally admitting that vaccinated people can't spread the virus. But he recommends masks, 6 feet distance, and other restrictions when the science supporting them is iffy at best. He throws percentages out for herd immunity that are all over the place, anywhere from 60% to 90%, admitting that the number he gives is intended to convince people rather than being backed by science.

At this point, Fauci isn't a scientist. He's a policy maker and a spokesman, and he is astoundingly bad at it.

In a crisis, you rarely get to make decisions with perfect information. But like you said, the vaccine blocking transmission was always by far the most likely outcome.

But instead of pushing the message ""the vaccine almost certainly blocks transmission, we're waiting on data to be totally sure, but earlier results suggest..."" he pushed a message that has perfectly reasonable and well intentioned people believing the vaccine doesn't block transmission, and handed a huge weapon to the anti vaxxers.

The costs of that fuckup is increased vaccine hesitancy that might be the difference between herd immunity and not. The costs of earlier lies and dumb decisions, like masks and refusing to say it was airborne, is measured in hundreds of thousands of lives.

A scientist's perspective and caution is a terrible way to make policy in a crisis.

The assumption is always that if the US is doing something there's no need to replicate the work yourself since the US will take care of you given you have pledged fealty to it (behind the scenes of course; publicly everything is framed as ""partnerships""). 

Anyway, why does canada have a tiny army? Because the US has a giant army and if anyone attacks us the US will take care of them (if only because are are on the US' border).

Why would Canada build out pharma companies when the US already has them?

The first dose of both mRNA vaccines essentially ""primes"" your immune system to be on the lookout for the spike protein. This is why people who had covid often have a stronger reaction to the *first* dose than the second.

So after the first dose, you may have some light side effects, but then a few weeks later, the second dose (which is the exact same ingredients and size as the first) then tells your body basically ""this spike protein is dangerous,"" and that's when the immune system really ramps up to create more and longer lasting antibodies. 

Since the spike protein is new for us, we react pretty strongly to it it seems. With the flu, we've all been exposed to it on some level for most of our lives, so the vaccine (for most people) isn't anything strong. I and others have a strong reaction, but it's not the norm.

Back to mRNA, the two-dose regimen for Pfizer and Modern don't contain ""boosters,"" rather two shots of the exact same thing. The eventual booster may be a slightly different formula to account for variants, or it may be a half dose, there's not much info on it.

With that in mind, I'd bet there will be more side effects than the first dose, but likely less than the second for most people since it's many months later as opposed to ""shocking"" the immune system just a few weeks later.",,,1619320552,{},gvs4p1v,False,t3_mxqd37,False,False,t1_gvs3ngg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mxqd37/the_flu_vanished_during_covid_what_will_its/gvs4p1v/,1619335805,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Sure those gatherings were already against  the rules but it's almost impossible to enforce what people do in their own homes.

And also in the same article.

Brazilian trials have indicated general efficacy of the drug at preventing symptomatic infection at just above 50%, though shower far higher efficacy at preventing hospitalization and against moderate and severe cases.

Indonesia gave the vaccine emergency-use approval based on interim data showing it was 65% effective, while in a Turkish trial it had an efficacy in preventing symptomatic infection of 83.5% and 100% in preventing severe illness and hospitalization.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah... the number varies a lot, but 50.4% fit the narrative therefore its most repeated.

However it is pretty obvious that mRNA vaccine so far shows the best result as it uses cutting edge technologies, Chinese vaccine uses old style traditional technologies that are less effective, however it does not mean they are useless or bad.

I do think the spread is heavily influenced by circumstances and behavior rather than this variant being much more terrible than other variants. India is pretty packed, population density is insane and hygiene conditions aren't ideal in large parts of the country. Mask-wearing isn't all too common and there have been few nation-wide regulations, especially over the last couple of months. People essentially thought the pandemic was a thing of the past once the first wave ended and everything went mostly back to normal. There's been tons of protests and religious ceremonies where people gathered in masses. All of that creates perfect conditions for true exponential growth, which is what we're seeing.

That being said, the variant likely plays a part, especially if it's more transmissible. It's just probably not going to be ""the"" variant that will destroy us, if that makes sense.

I don't know how controllable the situation in India really is. I feel like at this point they probably have to ""ride it out"" and wait till cases go down on their own, but obviously that's terrible and will lead to a lot of deaths.

On top of that, these companies have been making mRNA vaccines since before Trump was even elected. They were already working on multiple other mRNA vaccines because of MERS.

These companies had over 20 years of research ready to go in building this new type of vaccine. We got incredibly lucky with timing.

Operation Warp Speed paid for the vaccines manufacturing and purchasing.

Long version. 

The finish line is blurry. Maybe you've been vaccinated but a new strain emerges that the vaccine you got doesn't protect very well against. Though mostly the vaccines seem broadly effective, AZ versus the SA strain being a notable exception. 

But for the time being I'd say the finishing line is: everyone has been offered the chance to get an effective vaccine. 

Hopefully that also means everyone that can have the vaccine has had their vaccine shot. But if you won't, then so be it. Those that have been vaccinated have accepted the very small risk of major vaccine side effects. Those that won't get vaccinated accept the relatively larger risk of serious consequences when they get the virus.

Even without vaccination, treatment has improved greatly since the early stages. If you can keep the disease level under control by social measures and increasingly vaccination hospitals can cope. Where I am case numbers are very low, and even in those that are infected deaths are extremely rare.

Once social measures (travel restrictions and quarantine) are removed herd immunity will be rapidly achieved. People will have had the vaccine or will have had the disease. It is that simple.

The problem group is those that can't get vaccinated. Hopefully one or more of the vaccines will be safe and effective even for the very young.

The residual issue is those that can't get the vaccine because of some health condition. This is the challenge group to think through as it isn't clear how big this group is and if there are treatments that are effective for them.",,,1619364689,{},gvtr4q4,False,t3_my696q,False,False,t3_my696q,/r/Coronavirus/comments/my696q/officials_say_the_us_is_getting_closer_to_the/gvtr4q4/,1619367305,20,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,

There is no such thing as ""perfect"" immunity. If you continuously expose yourself to an insanely large amount of virus, your immune system will eventually be overwhelmed, like a well trained army that got overrun by an endless swarm of enemy. The vaccine works by rapidly throwing antibodies and immune cells against the virus, and if there are way too many virus, your immune system won't be able to produce the defense fast enough, and some of the virus will get through and end up infecting your cells. This is called ""breakthrough"" infection. Under normal conditions, the immune system can catch up and destroy the infected cells, limiting disease severity. But if you stay in that tub, the virus will eventually kill you no matter how vaccinated you are.

Have a look at /r/COVID19/comments/mfrv1i/interim_estimates_of_vaccine_effectiveness_of/ ""Under real-world conditions, mRNA vaccine effectiveness of full immunization (≥14 days after second dose) was 90% against SARS-CoV-2 infections regardless of symptom status; vaccine effectiveness of partial immunization (≥14 days after first dose but before second dose) was 80%"".

Note the ""regardless of symptom status"" part, this includes asymptomatic infections. So under real world conditions, about 90% of vaccinated healthcare workers are #1, 10% of them are #2. If those vaccinated healthcare workers were, say, not wearing masks and singing with their patients all the time, you would expect to see the ratio change as more of them get breakthrough infections.",,,1619350797,{},gvt4s7c,False,t3_my2wdt,False,True,t1_gvspoa5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/my2wdt/daily_discussion_thread_april_25_2021/gvt4s7c/,1619354357,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

""In the last 24 hours, looking at the Covid-19 situation worldwide and in the region, we are anxious about possible Covid-19 infections from the outside,"" Long said.

With India recording more than 340,000 new Covid-19 cases, Cambodia confirming more than 600 in the last 24 hours and Laos’s daily tally surpassing Vietnam’s highest of 82 cases on January 28, the health ministry is ""very anxious,"" Long said.

The new ""double mutant"" variants in India and the U.K. variant in Cambodia that are more transmissible pose a greater risk of community transmissions.

On Sunday, the HCMC Pasteur Institute confirmed that 85.7 percent of infected samples taken from imported Covid-19 cases from Cambodia contain the U.K. variant, and 14.3 percent have the South African variant.

""The global pandemic situation shows that new outbreaks are often larger, stronger and more devastating than previous ones,"" Long said.

""The health sector has prepared for the scenario of widespread local outbreaks, especially in the Mekong Delta region,"" the minister said, adding that his ministry is preparing for worst case scenarios like undetected infections in the community.

Over the last few months, the National Steering Committee on Covid-19 Prevention and Control and the Health Ministry have been warning about a new outbreak in the country as many people have entered the country illegally and others have dropped their guard.

Vietnam’s first coronavirus wave struck between January and February last year, with the epicenter being the northern province of Vinh Phuc. The second wave, which struck between July and August, was centered in the central city Da Nang City, and the third one earlier this year in the northern provinces of Hai Duong and Quang Ninh as well as Ho Chi Minh City.

The Mekong Delta, where the four provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap, Kien Giang and Long An share borders with Cambodia, has been named a potential Covid-19 hotspot.

People arriving from Cambodia are held at a border station in Vietnams An Giang Province, March 2021. Photo courtesy of An Giang border guards.

As Vietnam tightens border controls on land, controlling illegal entrance by sea remains a challenge, Long said.

He advised people to strictly adopt prevention measures and report any illegal entry to local authorities.

""We suggest that all localities ramp up surveillance to detect new infections early. They should prepare for scenarios of outbreaks spreading in the community, so they are ready to act without fumbling,"" Long said.

While Vietnam has sealed its borders, there are occasional illegal entrants who evade checkpoints to avoid mandatory quarantine. Several foreigners have also been caught entering the country illegally.

As per protocol, everyone entering the nation must be quarantined for 14 days, during which he/she will be tested at least twice.

So far, 16 out of 18 Lao provinces and cities have applied lockdown and curfew measures.

Vientiane is now said to be the hotspot in the second wave of COVID-19 outbreaks in the country.

A representative of the steering committee said at a press conference that all areas in Vientiane are at risk of infection.

People in the capital city were demanded to stay at home and only leave their houses in urgent cases, at the same time strictly follow disease prevention regulations.

The Lao Ministry of Health also encouraged people to continue to get COVID-19 vaccinations. It opened an online vaccination registration system for local people and foreigners living in Laos.

Vientiane’s steering committee for COVID-19 prevention and control on the same day said that the city was ready in all aspects, both in terms of manpower, quarantine facilities, hospitals and equipment, to cope with the pandemic.

Laos has so far reported no deaths related to COVID-19.

Meanwhile, 11 deaths were confirmed in Thailand over the last 24 hours, raising the toll to 140, according to the Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA).

CCSA said the country reported a total of 55,460 COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began, including 2,438 infections over the past 24 hours.

To prevent the pandemic from spreading, the Bangkok authorities ordered the closure of parks, gymnasiums, movie theaters and kindergartens from April 26 to May 9.

Obviously, that timeline is very different considering we’re at 100% eligible now in April, but I think the logic at that point was fair.

 I’m biased; I’m a teacher in Oregon and I signed up for my shot the day I was said to be eligible. I also notice that the state rates have been climbing- and that seemed to start about 3 weeks after schools started opening in mid February. With that, I am so incredibly thankful that I was able to be vaccinated before getting back in the classroom. I’m not sure the best route forward in this current stage. Distance learning was such a struggle, we’ve been back for 2 weeks and I’m finally seeing students who never showed up to Zoom, and never signed on to Canvas.  Even kids who started the year trying and doing well lost motivation and their parents are tired of fighting with them about school- but they’re starting to try again because they’re back in the classroom. 

But rates are climbing. I think we have had a couple students go home for quarantine due to close contact already.

The core difference for the vaccine is vaccine access. The US has the heavy industry and the shear dollars to produce vaccines within it's borders. Canada does not. The reason Canada does not have vaccine production is that it's previously nationalized vaccine development program was gutted before the current government, privatizated and sold off, so Canada does not have the scientists nor equipment to produce vaccines within it's borders. This doesn't really have anything to do with Canadian healthcare because you generally speaking don't think of healthcare as the heavy industry to develop novel vaccines but rather patient point of contact...which Canada has been on par with everyone else at. Aside from a glut of AZ due to medical review, Canadian provinces were pretty much in line with the states as far as using delivered vaccines into patients, some good and some not so good but overall on oar. 

So because of no domestic production, Canada needs to import and this is where the current troubles start. Because it was in all likelihood that the Trump admin was going to block things (this happened with PPE last year where the US government stopped a shipment of PPE bound for Canada mid transit and confiscated it), the Canadian strategy in procurement was to not fully rely on any one manufacturer or country....and this meant lots of orders in different parts of the world but mainly Europe, Canada went wide and basically ordered enough vaccines for something like 8 or 10 doses per person. I don't remember the exact breakdown but Canada was heavy into novavax and J&amp;J and COVAX but had plenty of orders of all viable vaccine candidates. This differed from the Israeli strategy (keep in mind Israel is only about 10m people compared to 35m in Canada) where Israel paid something like triple price for only Pfizer. In hindsight that worked out but if mRNA being new tech had some issues then Israel would be up a creek without a paddle. It was a ballsy gamble. Now because of Canadian sourcing mostly in Europe and India due to US defacto export bans and AZ being no go due to UK priority, moderna and Pfizer has some early production struggles which mean several early deliveries slipped which put Canada behind the proverbial 8 ball. Both Pfizer and Moderna early on in Europe had component sourcing issues (a side effect of the US Defense Production Act give US plants massive buying power) which delayed these a bit which consequently explains European and Canadian struggle. 


I don't know if that sheds light better. Love him or hate him but the Trudeau strategy was to go wide but not necessarily deep with varying timelines whereas other countries went narrow and deep and/or had domestic production capacity to rely on.",,,1619310920,{},gvrno6v,False,t3_mxle8r,False,False,t1_gvri2jc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mxle8r/from_scarcity_to_abundance_us_faces_calls_to/gvrno6v/,1619327159,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

More open borders during normal times is absolutely a good thing, however during a deadly global pandemic, you have to take care of your own people.  It isn't xenophobic to close off travel to regions that aren't taking the pandemic seriously and having giant, no mask, no distancing superspreader events despite being #1 in the world for new cases.  Pretending that it is because you want to take an imagined moral high ground is absolutely moronic.

Even if every other person in the world was fully vaccinated (which we're not even remotely close to), it would _still_ be a terrible idea to allow unrestricted travel to regions where the virus is running rampant, because while the variants that have emerged _so far_ aren't overwhelmingly resistant to the current vaccines, a country that's having a 50% test positivity rate is basically a giant petri dish.  Every single transmission has a very low chance of a vaccine-resistant mutation, but when you have that many new infections per day, the overall chance rises significantly.

Calling basic preventative measures xenophobic is not only insulting to the people out there who are currently trying to save lives as best they can, it's insulting to people who actually work to enact positive social change.  If you want to stop xenophobia, get off of your high horse and work to make positive changes in society.

&gt; I don't see the particular danger of a flight full of people from a particular country with a high case rate

Then you have no understanding of how this virus spreads.  A flight full of infected people could spread the virus to every person they come into contact with.  Those people would then unknowingly spread it to all of the people _they_ come into contact with, and so on and so on.

Hopefully, we can add 12-15 year olds to those numbers by the end of May. That would put another \~15M people (or \~5% of the population) into the mix and inch us closer to herd immunity.

In fact, based on [the CDC's estimates](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html) and assuming some decay from old cases, we're actually right around 2/3 of the country (66.6%, in fact) having some sort of antibody level in their system. We're getting *very* close to the herd immunity threshold.

For those worried about the vaccine hesitant, it looks like we don't need them to end this  pandemic in the US.

That Canada, a country with little-to-no domestic vaccine production, is “*ahead*” of the average E.U. member with that sort of access is frankly incredible.

They were much much later to embrace capitalism than most other Asian nations. 

Vietnam is a bit unique in fighting Covid. Very few other nations of similar economic status were able to do what they were able what they did: convince the populace that Covid was an evil invader and must be defeated to show the greatness of their society. It proved an effective strategy but could not be replicated in India. Not a valid comparison. 

Look at Latin American nations of similar prosperity as India. I don’t think any were successful fighting the pandemic, but don’t have the data in front of me. 

India really does need the foreign currency from their pharma sector. They don’t want to seem to be a risky place to do business, either.

The entire developed world is basically scrambling to get chips manufactured much faster now- It's the big reason you can't buy a PlayStation 5 or RTX 3080 right now.

/u/Mulla_ki_barat was making a joke that the chip shortage is actually due to chips being used in the vaccine, since there's a conspiracy theory that's at *least* a decade old about vaccines being used to [""Chip""](https://petkey.org/public/purchase/chipproducts.aspx) people in the same way you can chip a dog so a veterinarian or animal control person can identify it later if it's ever found by a stranger. There's also a misunderstanding that animal tracking chips- Which again are supposedly being used in humans- function as GPS tracking chips even though that [is and always has been impossible.](https://tractive.com/blog/en/good-to-know/dog-gps-implant-reasons-and-myths) Even so, billions of these impossible tracking chips being manufactured in a handful of months probably would cause quite a chip shortage, especially since each vial would probably need to be loaded with these damn things for them to get into everybody who gets vaccinated.

I usually get annoyed with these conspiracy theories because I just have a lot of experiences with real deal ""I hear things in the walls"" crazy people, but I've gotta admit sometimes it's incredibly entertaining to think about how these peoples' world views can even make hypothetical sense. Like where does the power supply come from? We need to charge our phones every night, do we need to charge the tracking chips embedded in our blood stream? The smallest ARM based processor ever made is 1.6 mm, and I'm honestly not even sure if it's sophisticated enough to consistently communicate GPS coordinates to some kind of online database since I'm not a computer guy, but that's still more than thrice as large as the width of a hypodermic needle, 0.6 mm. So how are these chips even getting inside of us? It's just fun in my mind, I think that about 95% of people aren't susceptible to these kinds of conspiracy theories so they're something that people who wanted it day one and even the people who don't feel comfortable getting vaccinated can come together to laugh at.

Otherwise it seems everyone else languished. 

Allen at Simon Frasier University argued that the lockdown policies are not effective because governments can't get enough compliance from individuals for them to be effective. That overall, between more restrictive and less restrictive policies, it's a wash.

And the more ""island-like"" a country, the more likely it is to do better.

http://www.sfu.ca/~allen/LockdownReport.pdf

It may be that the US approach (Texas, for example) nets better results overall, does overall less harm than the off and on ineffective lockdowns. We'll have to wait some years and look back to see what worked and what didn't work as well.

What bugs me a bit is why it's so commonly said that the denominator is 8 million doses administered.  The whole reason why this raised the concern was because the blood clots only impacted younger women, mostly 18-48, a group that presumably was disproportionately represented.  Rather than saying it was out of the total population of 8 million getting the vaccine, how many women 18-48 received it?  Granted, it's probably still pretty low risk, but the way is messaged is pretty disingenuous and misleading and could cause mistrust-- something there's too much of already.

What I don't understand is why there wasn't a formal recommendation or at least a consideration for another option where women 18-48 are recommended to seek one of the other two vaccines if they can and they're available?

The popular opinion back at the time in twitter was that the Costa Rican person was on average cleaner, more educated, better behaved and less stubborn than the average Panamanian.

Now we average like 300-400 new cases and 3 deaths per day. I'm not fan of the current government but it seems that after some initial missteps, they have managed to manage the pandemic well since January. Now I can see people in twitter saying we're better behaved than the Costa Ricans...lol",,,1619335253,{},gvsoj3t,False,t3_mxvckm,False,False,t3_mxvckm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mxvckm/costa_rica_breaks_three_records_in_a_single_day/gvsoj3t/,1619345794,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I explained this was unlikley as I had been isolating and taking all measures since last Feb 2020 and I work at home.  I am not eligible for vaccine yet.

So we all freaked out as I'm high risk due to pre existing health issues and I help care for elderly vulnerable high risk people.

I took the over the counter test and it failed. Took it again and it said negative. 

Now waiting on a blood test from gp. 

My symptoms which causes the dentist to insist I had have covid are a persistent nasty metal taste in my mouth ,  some jaw pain and dryness.

The different flu strains come from Asia during the rainy seasons.  It travels to the rest of the world from there.

It's not vaccines because we have flu vaccines every year and the flu is back again every year.  We need a new flu vaccine every year because we get a new strain from Asia every year.  Quebec actually stopped vaccinating people against the flu.

It's not masks because many Asian countries wear masks regularly and even more so during flu season.  They have never got rid of the flu.  New Zealand has not required masks since September and they have had no coronavirus or flu.

Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia had H3N2 on schedule in 2020 even with masks and lockdowns.  You can look on the WHO Flunet to see 

Lockdowns are all over the place in terms of severity.  We are seeing a total disappearance of the flu outside of Asia regardless of lockdown severity.  Not a 50% reduction or 30% reduction, a near total disappearance outside of Asia.

So, what is a common measure countries have taken that could affect the flu?  Most likely it is quarantines and travel restrictions.

There have been some indications of travel restrictions affecting the flu in the past.

Even the MIS-C kids I've taken care of- there have been a few that were REALLY sick, but I can count the number on one hand. Most do just fine. Meanwhile, last year (in January before COVID hit) the flu was crazy and like a quarter of the kids in the hospital were suffering from flu related complications, including some in the PICU.

Locking a country down is not to keep it from entering new areas, but to keep it from entering new human hosts. 

I've seen some reasonable arguments against a major lockdown in India, mostly that the Indian government isn't stable enough or wealthy enough to support the poor of the country through said lockdown, so they're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place. In the US, Europe, AU/NZ, etc, we could lock down in theory because we could still feed ourselves. India might not be able to do that. So locking down could cause widespread famine leading to even more deaths simply because India apparently can't keep everyone fed.

Some people just don't have that luxury.

Some people had a really bad reaction to the first shot (which I've seen all over that if you have a really bad reaction to the first shot, you've likely already had covid, so it's very similar to a second shot booster anyway) so they are scared to go get the second shot.

And lastly, I'm sure there's many people that see '80% effectiveness after one shot' and go 'eh, good enough!'.

Considering it amounts to less than 10% of people, supposedly (I read locally the numbers were 40% skipping it, so it must be much higher locally than nationally, which is interesting) I think we're doing pretty darn good.

Full on lockdowns won't work. Our economy is already pretty bad and a imposing complete lockdown would destroy it. 

Last year, when the government imposed a lockdown because of the first wave, a lot of poor migrant labourers who came to work in cities had no jobs and hence had to go back to their villages hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away.

Since during the lockdown, all forms of public transport like trains were restricted, these migrant labourers had to make the journey to their village through cycling or walking.

Some of them could reach their villages, but some have actually died under the sun while walking thousands of kilometers. Many of these people have been left unmarked and I doubt most of these people even got a proper funeral or their families even got notified of their deaths.

Imposing a lockdown is good and everything, the maximum the middle class/upper class people might suffer is a pay cut/dent in their revenue. That isn't really the case for lower middle class/poor people who are probably working as contract labourers, hawking vegetables, etc. They will be affected the most. And unlike say, the US or Australia, most people just don't magically get over a thousand dollars a month provided by the government(and I don't think our government can afford to do so anyways).",,,1619372433,{},gvu7g3h,False,t3_my7jk5,False,False,t1_gvtwtyy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/my7jk5/us_racing_to_send_aid_to_india_as_covid19_cases/gvu7g3h/,1619376937,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Its not like they have government assets and forex reserves, maybe thats what they could have been asking for. Cant wait for you to complain about China taking over Sri Lankan ports over failure to pay back loans, but when an American company wants to do it, its all ok. Somewhat hypocritical I guess. Recently, Pfizer did agree to sell at a not for profit price to the Indian govt, so I dont see why we are arguing over this. 

Then again, if you think I’m asking for free doses, keep thinking that way. Maybe Americans are used to predatory lending, but its a fairly new concept here in India on a large scale, so maybe I dont know much about it. I do know that asking for a military base isnt the first thing you should be asking for collateral when theres many other things you can ask for.

Calgary-based Providence Therapeutics said it has wrapped up Stage 1 clinical trials and will be headed to Stage 2 by June.

“We’re anticipating receiving approval in Q1 of 2022, and we will have tens of millions of doses ready to go when that approval arrives,” he said. “As soon as that approval happens, we’re going to be able to distribute those doses.”

Sorenson said the company is speaking to both provincial and federal government officials about procurement of its product, however, no formal contracts have been signed.

... 

companies like Edmonton-based Entos Pharmaceuticals are also looking at delivery of its vaccine, and preparing for booster shots required in the future.

“I think hindsight is 2020,” said John Lewis, the company’s CEO. “I think if we look at countries that have successfully vaccinated their populations, did invest early and substantially in vaccine development and manufacturing, I think Canada could be a lot farther ahead if we’d maybe made some more substantial investments.

“With the timeline we have, if everything goes well, we should be ready to file for emergency-use authorization by the end of the year.”

&gt;When asked when the Biden administration would decide on India’s request to lift a ban on the export of vaccine raw materials, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said: “...the United States first and foremost is engaged in an ambitious and effective and, so far, successful effort to vaccinate the American people.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“That campaign is well underway, and we’re doing that for a couple of reasons. Number one, we have a special responsibility to the American people. Number two, the American people, this country has been hit harder than any other country around the world – more than 550,000 deaths, tens of millions of infections in this country alone,” he said on Thursday.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is not only in the U.S. interest to see Americans vaccinated; but it is in the interests of the rest of the world to see Americans vaccinated, he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The point the Secretary (of State Antony Blinken) has made repeatedly is that as long as the virus is spreading anywhere, it is a threat to people everywhere. So as long as the virus is spreading uncontrolled in this country, it can mutate and it can travel beyond our borders. That, in turn, poses a threat well beyond the United States,” Mr. Price said in responses to questions.  
&gt;  
&gt;As for the rest of the world, “We will, of course, always do as much as we can, consistent with our first obligation,” he said.  
&gt;

[],,eternityslyre,,,[],,,,text,t2_y8bdk,False,False,[],"I agree that links to studies and data would have made this article better.

That said, there are two points to keep in mind here:

1. We need young(ish) people to know that they're not safe from COVID. This article makes that clear. It oversimplifies, but it is completely right on the fact that hospitalizations among young people are increasing, and it's at the point where ICU capacity may become a limiting factor. Dying because too many people are also dying and have taken up all the life-saving equipment is a really foolish way to go.

2. The data is very, very easy to find. I just googled ""Michigan COVID hospitalizations by age"" and got [Michigan.gov's official data](https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98163_98173_105123---,00.html). As you can see in the latest slide deck, hospitalizations among the age 18-59 group is up a lot. A lot a lot. Around 500% or more. So not only are cases increasing, hospitalizations are increasing. Young people might do better than old people with COVID, but they're still getting sick enough to overwhelm hospitals.

So there's a messaging question to think about, here. What do we want people to know? I think we want people to know that young people are ending up in hospitals with COVID, and need to shake off any ideas of youth-based immunity. I think we want people to know how to find the information. (And I agree that the NYT article could have been more quantitative about this.)

But I don't think we want people to ask, ""what does the data mean?"" and not have a clear answer. So I think the NYT messaging covers the important point.",,,1619369946,{},gvu23rx,False,t3_my8pqw,False,False,t1_gvtjqnn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/my8pqw/michigans_covid_wards_are_filling_up_with_younger/gvu23rx/,1619373758,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Why do you think mutations will work it way around current vaccines and nulify any efforts so far? Vaccines work well so far, maybe there are those combo mutated strains that could make vaccines less efficient, but not useless, people will just suffer some minor flu like symptoms instead of not catching it at all, the protection against serious problems is still there. Plus if a new mutant emerges, it takes months to widespread in the country of origin (for example the british variant was first detected in september, it was up to 70% more contagious, and it took 2-3 months to make problems in Britain, and about 6 months till it made problems in Europe and USA and other places), so even if right now todaya new mutant is created and it can bypass 100% of the current vaccination, which is very very unlikely btw, it would take unzil June or July that we would detect it, it would be widespread in the original country by July or August, and the rest of the world maybe by October or November. Vaccines production is ramping up so much, that we will be able to give booster shots (a 3rd dose, remember now people need 2 doses, but after that only 1, so we vaccinate 2x faster) to everyone who wants it in under 3 months. Pfizer said they will have the 2nd generation vaccine which is fully targeted against those nasty brazilian and south african variants ready in September. If they didnt have to still produce the original 2 shots per person vaccine, they would be able to flood all modern countries with the 3rd booster shot before Christmass.

So, we need to focus on giving people the first round of protection asap, and once people are imunized and new nasty variants emergence, we will have the production capacity and delivery on such high level and speed that we will be able to protect people faster than any possible variant could spread ( more people will receive a booster shot per day than how many people will get infected).

But, the last few weeks in Germany, all citizens are entitled to a free test each week. We've also seen multiple new testing centres open up where I am, testing increased in schools, workplaces etc. So we are testing more and finding more cases which is good. 

From what I hear in India, testing ranges from ok to poor depending on where you are. So it's likely that the numbers in India are heavily undereported depending on where the testing is better Vs where the outbreaks are. In comparison, I think Germany now is getting closer to ""true"" numbers, although you can never find every case so still undereporting by thousands per day like every medium to large country the world over I should imagine. 

The person above is right in that large numbers in Germany are less of a threat to wider society than in India. Here we tend to live in homes with space and room to quarantine. We can practice social distancing in our communities and have robust social security. In parts of India it's impossible to quarantine from your other household members and even more impossible to walk down the street with 2m distance from others. Its Also such a large country that it's much harder to pool resources across state lines like we see with oxygen (re)distraction because of the sheer time it takes to move stuff from one state to another, due to size but also road and train infrastructure. It's why the Indian government fucked up big time by not forward planning during their lull in cases. Much like how we in Germany let things slip in summer when we were down to 2-3oo a day.

Previous serology studies have found 0.01-0.1% IFR when combined with official deaths.  If we assume IFR is actually around 0.3%, then the undercounting is 3-30x.  I actually have no idea how you'd try to get a better estimate than this.

Another problem here is that because of this we don't have the slightest idea if their E484Q lineage is more, the same, or less deadly.  It sounds paranoid to say ""the mortality of this strain could be 10% for all we know"", but, well, if it were 10% we wouldn't know yet.  The E484Q mutation hasn't been seen anywhere else and we really just don't know anything about it (though this is surely going to change quickly).",,,1619375193,{},gvudctx,False,t3_my2wdt,False,False,t1_gvu9qcf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/my2wdt/daily_discussion_thread_april_25_2021/gvudctx/,1619380857,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
