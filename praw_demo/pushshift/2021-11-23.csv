&gt; In 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the smallpox taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly and still regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This I mention for the sake of the parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died under it; my example showing that the regret may be the same either way, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen.

So I think there have been parents who have gone through some of the same thoughts as you for about the last 300 years, if that's any comfort.

An [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653186/) from 2007 takes Franklin's situation and uses it to illustrate making decision trees to analyze the probabilities of outcomes from combinations of choices:

&gt; Decisions in medicine would be easy if they consisted of this choice: take treatment and you will live; don't and you will die. Unfortunately, Franklin's choice was not so simple. Franklin's son could die if either choice was made. If there was no risk of smallpox then ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù made sense. Inoculation became a relevant option when smallpox arrived in town. The key to the decision was the probability that Franklin's son would become infected in the natural way. If this risk was high enough, then at some point inoculation with its 2% mortality would be justified.

With a 15% mortality rate for smallpox infections and periodic recurring outbreaks throughout the 1700s, they came to the conclusion that the odds of becoming infected and dying were much greater than the odds of dying from inoculation. For COVID, the numbers of deaths and other ill effects from the disease and any major side effects from the vaccines are much smaller all around than for smallpox, but the odds are similarly in favor of vaccination.",,,,,,,,,1637737213,,,{},hlvglnt,False,t3_r0sk04,False,False,t1_hluz0qi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r0sk04/the_real_risk_of_heart_inflammation_to_kids_is/hlvglnt/,,4,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1638111010.0,

 He is against the vaccine, but this has scared him. Over the last 2 years he has spent a lot of time on the internet following political stuff.  I'm not a political person at all, I'm more common sense and prefer crafts, gardening and cooking to listening to other people's opinions. I'm vaccinated and hoping to make it through this with minimal symptoms. So far I am asymptomatic and I pray every minute of this I stay that way.

[],False,,rogmew,,,[],,,,text,t2_d0crs,False,False,"&gt; COVID doesn‚Äôt have the same statistical outcome when comparing the chance of death.

From an study by the Texas Department of Health and Human Services:

&gt; [From September 4 through October 1, 2021: Unvaccinated people were 13 times more likely to become infected with COVID-19 than fully vaccinated people.](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunize/covid19/data/vaccination-status.aspx)

That's a real, quantifiable 13-fold increase in risk of spreading a very deadly virus. In the analogy, being unnecessarily unvaccinated is like being drunk. If you're drunk by yourself in your own home, then you aren't really a danger to anyone else. Interacting with others in close-quarters while being unvaccinated is like *driving* drunk. You're not *guaranteed* to kill someone, but there is a substantial and quantifiable increase in risk.

&gt; Nobody should be expected or be forced to take a mandatory vaccination.

In the analogy, that's like saying nobody should be forced to be sober. To my knowledge, nobody in Austria is being *forced* to be vaccinated. They just can't do literally everything a vaccinated person can due to the increased risk to other people. Just like drunk people are allowed to be drunk, but aren't allowed to do everything a sober person is.

&gt; I am already at peace with the idea that they don‚Äôt.

I have a good friend who has myeloma and is immunocompromised as a result. I don't know how long we have together, but these unvaccinated people are putting my friend at a substantially increased risk of premature death. When you say you're ""at peace with the idea"" that people are putting my friend at risk, it seems very insensitive. It's like saying you're at peace with people driving drunk.",808981fd83c039c65a722ff638b217552bb9df39,True,False,,,,,0.0,1637744466,,0.0,{},hlvq53k,False,t3_qtody3,False,True,t1_hko2kf0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qtody3/austria_approves_lockdown_for_unvaccinated/hlvq53k/,1637744482.0,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,,,

Because yes, I feel perfectly ok being treated by someone who believes in the science of natural immunity.

If you‚Äôre not, that‚Äôs on you.  You can try to switch to a different nurse if you get one that‚Äôs not vaccinated.  And if there are none, you can drive to the next hospital to see if they have any vaccinated nurses available to serve you. 

Should all the rest of society be deprived of even having the option just because of how YOU feel about the situation?

I‚Äôm vaccinated.  I work in healthcare.  I don‚Äôt give a single damn about the vaxx status of any of my coworkers, nor do I fear them.  There‚Äôs bigger fish to fry here.  A ton of my coworkers quit when the vaccines were mandated.  A number of them probably won‚Äôt come back even if offered the opportunity.  The remaining few are now picking up the slack and doing the job of 3-4 people each and getting super burned out.  This was an industry that was already short staffed even before Covid, Covid made it worse, now the mandates will be nail on the coffin for some.  I warned you guys at the beginning of all this mandate business that we‚Äôve been closing down entire wings.  We will see entire hospitals shut down next.  How is this ‚Äúsaving our healthcare system?‚Äù  Now is this ‚Äúincreasing hospital capacity?‚Äù  It‚Äôs literally doing the opposite.  All because people like you decided your distaste for certain people were more important than providing healthcare for all.

There is an article a couple posts up about that big healthcare system in Massachusetts  having to cancel surgeries due to short staffing.  So why did they fire like 2,000 healthcare workers over vaxx status, while ignoring natural immunity?  

Ive been seeing reports in the news about hospital closures. A hospital in Connecticut that was serving a low income community.  One In Pennsylvania.  Another in New York.  Wait, scratch that, two in New York.  One in Arizona.  One in Long Beach California.  And that‚Äôs just in the last three days.  Go ahead and plug ‚Äúhospital close‚Äù into Google and click the news tab.  Look at all the hospitals closing in the past week alone, way more than I can mention here. All across the country.

Is that what we want during a pandemic right before the winter wave?  Is mass hospital closures across the country a sign that mandates are working as intended?

I get that people are upset at healthcare workers who made a choice they disagree with.  That‚Äôs why you want them punished, right?  Firing them was not enough for you, you guys were really pushing to make sure they wouldn‚Äôt even get unemployment benefits.  You guys came here and called them stupid dumb idiots and made your distain known.  What about when the backlog of surgeries plus Covid plus flu cases start to overwhelm you as hospitals around you are shutting down due to short staffing.  Might you want them back if it gets bad enough.  Do you think that after getting worked to the bone all throughout this pandemic and then being let go and publicly shamed and disrespected and denied unemployment benefits, they‚Äôll even want to come back?  Many would, I think, and god bless them for it.  But I know at least one healthcare worker who used to work with me who said she‚Äôs over being worked like a dog and then disrespected and put out like yesterday‚Äôs trash just because she got Covid serving the public last year before vaccines existed and now no cone wants to talk about natural immunity.  

So when can we start talking about natural immunity?  I‚Äôll start.  Last week, a foia request was made to the CDC asking it to release any data on naturally immune individuals being reinfected who went on to transmit the virus.  The CDC admits they have no such record of ANYONE was had a prior infection, recovered, got reinfected, and went on to transmit the virus to others.  NOT ONE.  

&gt; The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, said it has no record of an individual previously infected with COVID becoming reinfected and transmitting the virus to others. The FOIA request, submitted Sept. 2 by attorney Aaron Siri of the Siri &amp; Glimstad law firm on behalf of the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN), sought the following information: ‚ÄúDocuments reflecting any documented case of an individual who: (1) never received a COVID vaccine; (2) was infected with COVID once, recovered, and then later became infected again; and (3) transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to another person when reinfected.‚Äù The CDC responded Nov. 5, stating: ‚ÄúA search of our records failed to reveal any documents pertaining to your request. The CDC

So can the CDC please continue this conversation to let us know why we are firing nurses with higher than average levels of natural immunity when they lack any data to suggest they can catch the virus again and transmit it to others?  If there is no evidence they pose a danger to their coworkers or patients, why are we shrinking hospital staff and closing down hospitals and entire hospital wings based on this unfounded fear?

[],False,,michaelthecoder,,,[],,,,text,t2_llftk,False,False,"Absolutely it makes sense to get a booster.

You likely won't need a booster every 6 months. The public guidance is atrocious, and I can confirm that our health officials are being dishonest. Despite what people think, last year we pretty much expected boosters by this point, though maybe it's a couple months earlier than expected. However, what people don't realize is that boosters are normal and nearly any disease we vaccinate against requires two or three boosters with an increasing amount of time between them. So far the research leans towards that COVID is the same, as the booster is giving far more antibodies than the original shot does, which is a great sign. It's quite possible that the COVID vaccine is really just a 3 or 4 shot vaccine, and that with boosters we might even be able to get to herd immunity and COVID can go away.

So if the news is this great, then why the public depression about the vaccines? Well, the main reason is that the WHO is basically lying to get the political effect they want. The WHO is pretending that boosters are useless, and have said things such as that the booster is ""a third life jacket"". While they are correct that it won't really protect you against dying any more, they are lying because it has a drastic effect on spread.

I don't have a degree in health, but I do have one in math. If you had looked up a video on vaccines before the pandemic, no one would have talked about how great they are because they protect you personally from dying. Rather, the greatest effect of vaccines is that they prevent people from spreading it. This causes a butterfly effect, where you don't spread it to people and they don't spread it to people and entire branches of the tree of infection. This reduces infection, hospitalization, and death, possibly even more than the vaccine's self protection, but it does it all indirectly and is hard to measure. While the protection against your personal death isn't effected by boosters much, to get protection against spread the boosters are extremely important. So the WHO is basically lying to everyone to try to promote vaccine equity - which is short sighted and will harm global health once we have enough vaccines and people need to be boosted.

The other aspect that is making think boosters are worse than they likely are is that people are comparing this vaccine to the flu vaccine. The flu vaccine does need to be taken yearly. However, that is because the flu mutates much more to the point where we need a different vaccine each year. COVID does mutate a lot, but at this point we are still using the same vaccine. It's possible this could change, so I can't promise one way or the other and we still could end up needing vaccines yearly. But at this point I'd say it at least looks possible and maybe even favorable that boosting once or twice should be enough.

Finally, you may have noticed that I said once a year. All signs we have currently point to that COVID is seasonal. So even in the worst case that for some reason we technically need vaccines every six months, that's not how it would work in practice. I believe the flu vaccine doesn't actually give you yearly protection either, we just time it to get past the peak. So if for some reason we need constant vaccines going forwards (which I think is the smaller possibility), then we would almost certainly get it with the flu vaccine yearly before the winter peak would hit.",4d4082b22434969d86ee5029f980f3163f7436ae,True,False,,,,,0.0,1637767413,,0.0,{},hlwr2xh,False,t3_r0zygy,False,True,t1_hlwimkc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r0zygy/daily_discussion_thread_november_24_2021/hlwr2xh/,1637767425.0,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,,,

\&gt;Tons of people are getting Covid  
  
Yes, that's exactly the problem.  
  
\&gt;They get better  
  
Over 5 million people didn't. The current worldwide death toll for COVID is sitting at 5.17 million people (roughly the population of South Carolina). In the US alone, 775,000 people (roughly the population of Seattle) have died from COVID. [Around half of people who recover will experience ""long COVID""](https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/how-many-people-get-long-covid-more-half-researchers-find/), and there is a [real possibility of organ failure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7533045/), even in otherwise young and healthy patients. I personally know people who have permanent organ damage because of COVID. So no, they don't all get better.  
  
\&gt;Get the vaccine or don‚Äôt. Risk it if you want  
  
The problem with this mentality is that if you don't get vaccinated, you're not just risking yourself but every person you come into contact with who may not be immunized. There are quite a few legitimate reasons why someone might not have immunity. Maybe they got the shot but are receiving medical treatment using immunosuppressants which counteract the vaccine. Maybe they're too young to get it yet. Maybe they're too pregnant to get a booster (one of my friends is in this situation right now). Maybe their doctor told them they can't get it because of an allergy or an autoimmune disease.  
  
The point is that when you can get vaccinated and choose not to, you're risking more lives than your own.  
  
\&gt;Why are outlets still reporting about people getting Covid  
  
Because people are still dying from COVID, like what? It's a global pandemic that, again, has killed over 5 million people. The news reports on current events and COVID is still a current event.",,,,,,,,,1637766331,,,{},hlwoiyr,False,t3_r0j8lx,False,True,t1_hlwek7b,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r0j8lx/seven_doctors_contract_covid_after_attending/hlwoiyr/,,1,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1638137096.0,

It is really easy to understand that once you start deciding one group of people is not worthy of medical treatment you can start applying that thought process to other people. 

Think of it this way: if you decide anti-vaxers are not deserving of medical treatment because they could have avoided the virus by getting vaccinated then what stops a religious doctor in a conservative state from denying STD treatment to a gay man? Or denying OBGYN treatment to a woman pregnant out of marriage? They could easily claim those people could have avoided their ailments.

I'd say yes. The risk of myocarditis is very small (at most, 1 in 10K, and almost all of those are small or moderate, with no lasting consequences). 

&gt;Also, I'm not sure if the vaccine is really all its cracked up to be, as reading the NY Times, this year, we already have more deaths than last year, when there was no vaccine. 

It is all it's cracked up to be. First of all, COVID didn't start until March in 2020, and we didn't have a large percentage of vaccinations until maybe April/May? And then the Delta variant is much more contagious than the original one, so the comparison of 2020 with 2021 doesn't tell you much about vaccines.

&gt;It seems like people are just getting re-infected with COVID, as it doesn't make sense that we can have 100k cases a day and still not have infected everyone in the U.S.

100k cases a day give you \~36M cases a year, the US population is \~300M, so it would take you almost 10 years, assuming no reinfections. It's hard to reason about big numbers :)

We don't know how often we will need the boosters, with some luck it will be less than once a year. Vaccines protect you, but also the community, so, although not \*everybody\* who skips the vaccination or booster is a horrible person, unfortunately, it has become politicized, so most who don't get it \*are\* horrible people, or at least doing it for horrible reasons :)

Some guidance will change, since COVID is new, and there's a ton of stuff we don't know. Our health officials are not purposefully lying, it's just we're learning about this stuff, and some people are purposefully trying to highlight and exaggerate any mistakes.

Try not to get depressed.

I've read numerous news articles about studies showing the protection from *getting a symptomatic infection* wanes over time, but the protection against illness on a level leading to hospitalization and/or death remains high. Put more simply, shortly after vaccination, you're unlikely to get sick from covid at all, much less be hospitalized or die, but over time the possiblity of you getting sick from covid (but still not being hospitalized or dying) slowly goes up.
  
Every symptomatic case of covid, where it's got it's hooks in you and your immune system is playing catch-up, is an opportunity for it to mutate. If, by getting boosters as directed, you not only maintain those high levels of protection against hospitalization/death, but also to getting a symptomatic case, it means your body is defeating the virus before it can get a foothold and before you become detectably ill.  Fewer cases of covid overall is good and desirable, period.
  
Think of it like this, if it helps... Imagine a house being you, the house being on fire is a symptomatic case, and the house burning down is like hospitalization or dying. Right after immunization is like the fire department having just had a drill with tiny fires around your house and putting them out. Now there are a bunch of firefighters standing around nearby. That's your immune system on high alert. If something so much as starts to smolder (you're exposed to covid), the near-at-hand firefighters stomp that out right away (that's you not even getting symptomatically ill).  Over time, if there hasn't been a fire in awhile, fewer firefighters are hanging around nearby. If something smolders or catches fire (covid exposure), it may take longer to put the fire out with fewer firefighters around, but they call back to the station for reinforcements, and the fire is contained and your house doesn't burn down (that would be you getting perhaps a mild symptomatic case, but still not getting severely ill or dying). Even later, after awhile with no fires (exposures to covid) you don't really have firefighters hanging around ready to leap on the first sign of smoke anymore, and you catch fire again (another covid exposure). You call the fire department, and they hustle out, but by then you've got a bit of a fire going because it took time for them to mobilize out to you. They still put it out before the house burns down (you don't go to the hospital or die, but you got sick, maybe a pretty bad case).",,,,,,,,,1637785118,,,{},hlxzyjz,False,t3_r16po0,False,False,t1_hlxm75s,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r16po0/us_braces_for_fifth_wave_of_covid_on_eve_of/hlxzyjz/,,38,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1638163864.0,

&gt;  
&gt;**Exactly, they don't factor in if they think the person is deserving**. You proved my point exactly.

Lol wut?

&gt;No, **nurses and doctors do not factor in if they think an individual is deserving** when triaging them. They just try to save as many lives as they can.  
&gt;  
&gt;**That is also why they examine a patient's life when considering organ transplants**: to get the most value out of that gift. If you are an alcoholic or smoker your likely going to live a less healthy/long life than someone who isn't so they give it to the person likely to live the longest and healthiest (in terms of quality) life.

So they do decide who is more deserving of an organ donation, or they don't? Contradicting yourself within two sentences is pretty impressive.

&gt;This is a strawman no one is arguing. No one person is more deserving than another, that is firmly established in medical ethics.

But you just said that doctors choose who deserves organs, so which is it? Do they or don't they choose who is deserving of care/organs?

&gt;That is fine, but you have to realize your opinion is irrelevant and you will never see anyone that has any responsibility over deciding policy even remotely consider your position.

Wrong again. 

This is already being debated on medical ethics boards all over the country. Here's a few examples, but a quick Google search will turn up many more. Plenty for rationing care to the unvaccinated, and plenty against. However, this is a very active debate and hardly ""irrelevant"" or ""anyone that has any responsibility over deciding policy even remotely consider my position"".

""However, the strength of a physician‚Äôs obligation to treat may vary under different circumstances, and determining whether, in a particular instance, a physician may ethically decline a patient requires careful reflection. In the context of a highly transmissible disease that poses significant risk of severe illness for which a safe, effective vaccine is available, the decision to accept or decline a patient must balance the urgency of the individual patient‚Äôs need; the risk the patient may pose to other patients in the physician‚Äôs practice; and the need for the physician and staff, to be available to provide care in the future.""

[https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/ethics/can-physicians-decline-unvaccinated-patients](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/ethics/can-physicians-decline-unvaccinated-patients)

""Some clinicians wonder whether they are ethically obligated to treat unvaccinated patients. ‚ÄúThis is a serious concern among many doctors. I suspect that sooner rather than later, some physicians will start avoiding unvaccinated patients in the outpatient setting,‚Äù says Jacob M. Appel, MD, JD, MPH, HEC-C, director of ethics education in psychiatry at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.""

""When it comes time to ration health care resources, there are no good options left. The question is how to find the least-bad option and save the most lives.  
The Governor‚Äôs Expert Emergency Epidemic Response Committee is updating the state‚Äôs crisis standards of care for how hospitals should prioritize patients if a worsening COVID-19 crisis leaves them unable to provide the best health care to everyone.  
That process can lead to potentially thorny ethical questions: Should vaccinated patients be given priority over people who‚Äôve chosen not to get inoculated against the virus? In what way should patients‚Äô age play into decisions made about rationing care?  
When the standards were written at the beginning of the pandemic in spring 2020, vaccines weren‚Äôt yet available, science knew relatively little about the new virus and the biggest concern was running out of ventilators.  
Now, Colorado is more likely to run out of dialysis machines or beds in intensive-care units than ventilators; doctors know more about which drugs might help COVID-19 patients; and vaccines are widely available.""

It is kind of like drug court, but I would argue that this virus is much more dangerous than any drug use in terms of societal impact. The problem is, there is no political will to do this. We already tried that carrot approach, now it is time to take out the stick.

Another incentive would be to not pay out federal tax returns until a person shows proof of full vaccination. Although, I don't see any political will to get out the stick anytime soon.

They could have spent months seeing if 30 days or 45 days or 60 days etc was the best time for the second shot. Faster rollout was advantageous at that time, it‚Äôs far easier just to give a booster.

J&amp;J probably suffered this as well it should be two doses but it‚Äôs a long slow ramp up (such to the point where 14 days really shouldn‚Äôt have been considered fully vaccinated and it should have been at least 28).

Yes you are right. I think many people actually will get ""breakthrough cases"" but thats not a bad thing at all as long as the vaccines and cellular immunity protects us from severe disease.

Many people consider immunity only as ""sterilizing immunity"" but there are actually many endemic viruses we have immunity but no sterilizing immunity against. For example any of the other 4 endemic coronaviruses like Oc43 or other common cold viruses like rhinoviruses. We catch them from time to time and get a mild cold although we have immunity against all of them.

Immunity is much more complex than just ""sterilizing immunity"".

Nobody wants to get COVID, right? COVID is no fun, it‚Äôs extremely infectious, and can cause permanent organ damage even in children. 

There exists an extremely safe preventative measure that prevented 100% of COVID infections in adolescents in a scientific trial. 

You suggest people prevent COVID by... getting COVID. 

The worst case outcome of getting vaccinated is that a kid:

-	gets a treatable case of myocarditis (much less serious and much less likely than the myocarditis associated with COVID infection, I‚Äôll add)
-	gets COVID anyway (but have a milder disease), which would provide that natural immunity you covet so much

So the worst case outcome of getting vaccinated is still better than getting COVID as an unvaccinated kid, which is your plan. 

I reiterate, if your hesitation with vaccinating children is myocarditis, then you should be much more worried about children contracting COVID, because the chance of myocarditis is a lot higher with COVID infection.

[],,,MrDedham,,,[],,,,text,t2_n29i942,False,False,"Re-exposure to an antigen (such as the Spike protein or Nucleocapsid protein) would result in class switching of the B-cells from IgM to IgG. This would occur in the case of a booster dose of any vaccine targeting SARS-CoV2 S protein, and the predominant blood antibody would be IgG and not IgM after a second dose (or reinfection). Additionally, while in many cases serology would reveal that anti-S IgM (or IgG) indicates acquired (adaptive) immunity and anti-N IgG or IgM indicates prior infection, certain vaccines contain both antigens (eg Sinovac)*. 

In the case of a whole-inactive vaccine*, the first dose would result in humoral response consisting primarily of anti-S and anti-N IgM. After the second dose (if enough time is given between doses), a whole-inactive vaccine (or any boosters) would result in humoral response of IgG to both Nucleocapsid and Spike. 

In the case in which a whole-inactive vaccine is boosted with a Adenovirus-vectored** or mRNA** vaccine (or vice versa), the serology would show a humoral response of IgG to Spike and a IgM response to the Neucleocapsid antigen. 

*Whole-Inactive vaccines will expose the BCR to both S and N antigens, as all structural proteins are present (in a similar manner to  infection), and so the immunoglobulin tighter should reflect ""immunity"" to both (although only an anti-S humoral response would be protective).

Am I understanding correctly that you're referring to anecdotal health issues that arise post-vaccination?  I would say if that's the case, we should have credible peer reviewed studies on the matter.  The same exact ones we have for post infection.  We have such studies in regard to myocarditis, but I am not aware of others.  I am sure this is where the antivaxxers would step in with ""Well yea, but that's because agenda!"".

&gt; Critical thinking in this case might lead to the idea that that in some cases immune system overreacts to vaccine and can seriously screw things up.

Again, this is where you need a peer reviewed study or two.  And this again brings me back to the fact that if you assume infection is inevitable, you're already assuming this particular ""risk"" regardless.  And just to be clear, I'm putting risk in quotes because until we have peer reviewed studies on said risk, it's nothing more than ""agenda"".",42ff8968350870963a06c5757ab2264b42dd935f,True,False,,,,,0.0,1637765290,,0.0,{},hlwm2ka,False,t3_r0sk04,False,True,t1_hlwkm3x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r0sk04/the_real_risk_of_heart_inflammation_to_kids_is/hlwm2ka/,1637765304.0,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,,,

Also, I'm not sure if the vaccine is really all its cracked up to be, as reading the NY Times, this year, we already have more deaths than last year, when there was no vaccine. It seems like people are just getting re-infected with COVID, as it doesn't make sense that we can have 100k cases a day and still not have infected everyone in the U.S. 

I'll probably get the shot, as it can reduce the chance of a severe reaction, but I don't want to get a booster every six months just to reduce the potential for a severe reaction, when a severe reaction is already unlikely because I'm young, and I wear masks every time I go to public spaces. It's just, I'm a little frustrated that the conversation around the pandemic is that ""if only we had more people vaccinated, our situation would be much better"" when this year, we're doing worse in cases and deaths than last year, and Europe is doing even worse than us when its population is more vaccinated than us. 

I think the conversation around COVID, if what I'm saying is true, should be that its seasonal like the flu, though its much more severe, and that the vaccines can help reduce the risk of severe disease, but there are potential negative reactions to it and it won't protect you so much from getting the virus and spreading it, and so you're not a terrible person if you decide not to get it (though its probably the best you do get it). 

I don't know, I think I'm just a little depressed about this whole situation. It's just this whole pandemic situation doesn't make sense to me.

I am no statistician, but I bet we could find one here.  Risk is often calculated over a certain period of time.  Most leading scientists believe that it is guaranteed that every single person on earth will end up with COVID at one point or another in the future.  In the same way that everyone (and especially kids) have encountered the flu.  Given this information, I believe it's safe to say that your child is going to either assume the smallest of risk of myocarditis from the vaccine now, or a larger risk at some point in the future.

Now, we also know that there are a litany of potential side effects that come with COVID.  Less so with children, but there are plenty of posts on Reddit here of parents with children has lost the sense of smell or taste for a prolonged period of time.  Imagine what kind of eating disorders that can lead to.  Not to mention a bunch of studies on all sorts of other stuff that the COVID virus has the potential to inflict.  Again it's still early and we won't really know these things conclusively for potentially years to come.  But there are definitely signs of organ damage, neurological damage, etc.  Surely it'll be less in kids, but we won't know any of this for a while.  The vaccine however has no virus attached to it, it's merely a part of the spike protein.  It's literally just the harmless part of the virus.  The only potential side effects are those from the immune response, as there is no virus to harm you.  So if we assume that you and your child will encounter the virus sooner or later, this entire things is reduced to a complete no brainer.

That's gotta be one of the biggest sources of infection for children.  Their risk of heart inflammation is going to be much higher going to school unvaxxed instead of getting the vax and then living a full life.

The perspective makes a certain amount of sense, but ultimately it's a choice either way.  Choose to isolate completely and stunt their childhood, choose to mostly isolate and they're already at risk of covid, or choose to get them the vaccine and inject the extremely small chance of side effects directly into them.  Either of the first two choices are simply wrong based on the math.

I've thought for a while that a lot of vaccine decisions are like the trolley dilemma and the (related) fat man dilemma.

Giving people vaccines will *cause* a small number of deaths due to side-effects, whereas not giving them will *allow* a larger number of deaths due to the virus (the gap between deaths caused and deaths prevented by the vaccine is smaller for younger age groups).

In theory, it's obviously much better to cause a few deaths than to allow many, but a lot of people have a very hard time making that decision.",,,,,,,,,1637727887,,,{},hlv0xmj,False,t3_r0sk04,False,False,t1_hluz0qi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r0sk04/the_real_risk_of_heart_inflammation_to_kids_is/hlv0xmj/,,19,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1638102347.0,

Even though I was very exposed to many of them, even sharing a cigarette with one of them who tested positive the next day, I managed to avoid it...

All of those infected, including the one unvaccinated person, had mild symptoms which mimicked the usual seasonal stuff that comes around this time of year, and no one had serious symptoms luckily.

Right now all studies about cellular immunity with double vaccinated people prove a pretty solid immunity after 6 months+.

If you speak about antibodies you are right but it is pretty normal that protective antibodies decrease over time after any vaccination or infection because our body don't want to waste ressources to create antibodies that might not be needed.

[],,,D1x13L0u,,,[],,,,text,t2_whwtb,False,False,"I know you've made three posts and had them refused. To be honest, it seems like you've made up your mind already that vaccines do not work.  I don't believe that to be true, and you asked for a response, so here is mine.  Vaccines did work to lower the amount of severely ill patients that were in ICUs, filling beds.  It's fine if you don't want to believe it, but the data is there. The CDC  has posted it, complete with pretty graphs to make all of it easy for even me to understand.  Those that were filling those beds were unvaccinated people.    
Then, as time went on, we heard from Israel that they were seeing some waning in the vaccine's efficacy.  It's a new vaccine, so there was no way to know how long they would stay effective.  We were already seeing breakthrough infections, but to be honest, we never knew what type of vaccine those breakthrough cases received.  The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine was only 77% effective from the get-go, but many people chose it anyway due to its ""one and done"" dosing, their distrust of mRNA technology, or the fact that Johnson &amp; Johnson is a trusted household brand name.  I suspect that many of those breakthrough cases were J&amp;J recipients...but as no one has disclosed that data, I cannot prove that.     
Now that vaccines are waning, we are now seeing breakthrough cases again, and those who had underlying conditions that could worsen with Covid are now joining those unvaccinated people in the ICU.  In addition to Covid patients, though, we now have people who delayed treatment for their chronic conditions needing those beds also because their conditions have worsened while they were sheltering at home, fearful of putting themselves at risk to sit in a doctor's office.   Hence, they are now asking for people to get boosters.  Boosters are restoring efficacy in Israel, so we believe it will help in the US as well if people get them.     
The problem is, it was hard enough to get many of the vaccinated to actually roll up their sleeves, and we don't know if they will all willingly do it again and get a booster.  I hope they will, personally, especially if they have underlying conditions that would make Covid non-survivable for them. I don't want anyone to die from this.  I understand 60 million people in the US are still not vaccinated.    
As for your question of when we go back to normal...I do not see in the near future how we could ever return fully to 2019-living without risk.  I predict masking and distancing will always be with us in some manner for the long-term.  I am not a fan of mandates, but I don't think personal responsibility works either.  How can we expect people to use personal responsibility to mitigate a virus that many of them do not even believe is a threat?  Some people still think this virus is a hoax or nothing more than a flu.  There was a story out of Italy this week where a man nearly died from attending a Covid Party, intentionally getting infected, and he still said afterwards that he didn't' think Covid was real and he thought he had normal pneumonia.  How can we ever reach any semblance of normal when so many people in the world cannot understand how viruses work?  It was one thing when people denied Covid because they, themselves, had never known a person to fall ill or die from Covid. Now we have people who barely survived their Covid infections saying they still don't believe they had it.  How can we move forward with that type of thought?

No disease has been in the news in our lifetime like COVID and no vaccine has been so important.

Well, even before the COVID vaccine was a thing, some healthy 45 year olds suddenly died of heart attacks. Weird stuff happens. But people weren't making threads about it.

Instead, more people in the United States have died from Covid-19 this year than died last year, before vaccines were available.

&gt;As of Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had recorded 386,233 deaths involving Covid-19 in 2021, compared with 385,343 in 2020. The final number for this year will be higher, not only because there is more than a month left but because it takes time for local agencies to report deaths to the C.D.C.

&gt;Covid-19 has also accounted for a higher percentage of U.S. deaths this year than it did last year: about 13 percent compared with 11 percent.

&gt;Experts say the higher death toll is a result of a confluence of factors: most crucially lower-than-needed vaccination rates, but also the relaxation of everyday precautions, like masks and social distancing, and the rise of the highly contagious Delta variant.

&gt;Essentially, public health experts said, many Americans are behaving as though Covid-19 is now a manageable, endemic disease rather than a crisis ‚Äî a transition that will happen eventually but has not happened yet.

&gt;Yet many are also refusing to get vaccinated in the numbers required to make that transition to what scientists call ‚Äúendemicity,‚Äù which would mean the virus would still circulate at a lower level with periodic increases and decreases, but not spike in the devastating cycles that have characterized the pandemic. Just 59 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated, the lowest rate of any Group of 7 nation.

&gt;‚ÄùWe have the very unfortunate situation of not a high level of vaccine coverage and basically, in most places, a return to normal behaviors that put people at greater risk of coming in contact with the virus,‚Äù said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ‚ÄúIf you take no protections whatsoever, you have a virus that is capable of moving faster and you have dangerous gaps in immunity, that adds up to, unfortunately, a lot of continued serious illness and deaths.‚Äù

&gt;Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center, estimated that roughly 15 percent of the U.S. population might have immunity from prior infection, which is not as strong or durable as immunity from vaccines.

&gt;Many of those people have also been vaccinated, but even assuming the two groups didn‚Äôt overlap and so 74 percent of Americans had some level of immunity, that still would not be enough to end the pandemic, said Dr. Gounder. It would probably take an 85 to 90 percent vaccination rate to make the coronavirus endemic, she said.

&gt;‚ÄùWhen vaccines rolled out, people in their minds said, ‚ÄòCovid is over,‚Äô‚Äù Dr. Gounder said. ‚ÄúAnd so even if not enough people are vaccinated, their behavior returned ‚Äî at least for some people ‚Äî to more normal, and with that changing behavior you have an increase in transmission.‚Äù

&gt;Some news outlets reported last week that confirmed 2021 deaths had surpassed 2020 deaths. Those reports stemmed from counts of deaths based on when the deaths were reported, not when they happened ‚Äî meaning some deaths from late 2020 were counted in early 2021. The C.D.C. counts, which did not show that mark being reached until this week, are more accurate because they are based on the dates on death certificates.",,,,,,,,,1637769645,,,{},hlwwjym,True,t3_r18dz7,False,False,t3_r18dz7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r18dz7/despite_vaccines_the_us_has_lost_more_lives_to/hlwwjym/,,9,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1638141763.0,

So Astra Zeneca decided to give 2nd dose anyway, Sputnik V decided to use a different adenovirus for 2nd dose, but that's costlym and looks like they are going the same route as AZ with Sputnik Lite. J&amp;J decided to turn the disadvantage into a feature so just said the vaccine is a single dose.

My personal experience wasn't too bad. The tooth came out really easily and the recovery wasn't bad at all, I didn't even fill the prescription for painkillers that the oral surgeon gave me. I got super lucky in that the surgeon was able to place the post the same day as the extraction which is possible in some cases depending on which tooth is being extracted and the state of your jawbone. 

About 4 months later I went back to the surgeon for a follow-up to check on the healing process and got cleared for the crown placement which was to be done by my dentist. My dentist got me in for measurements the following week and then 3 weeks later placed the crown. 

The whole process took just under 5 months from extraction to crown placement.

&gt;The C.D.C. said the data, updated almost every day on its website, had been corrected. As of Tuesday evening, about 81 percent of people in Pennsylvania had received at least one shot of a vaccine, according to C.D.C. data, whereas on Monday the data indicated that about 84 percent of people in the state had gotten a shot.

&gt;The agency has been periodically revising vaccination numbers in states since July 14. Altogether, the C.D.C. and the states have reduced the number of reported doses in the U.S. by about 2 million.

&gt;The C.D.C. has posted on its website that the revisions are part of a collaboration with states to gather their most ‚Äúcomplete and accurate‚Äù data. Sometimes the revisions result in more shots being added to a state‚Äôs tally. Other times they result in a drop. Illinois, for example, revised its data to add about 316,000 doses in late October only to subtract about 214,000 doses a few weeks later.

&gt;Barry Ciccocioppo, communications director for Pennsylvania‚Äôs Department of Health, said that the department ‚Äúcontinues to update and refine our vaccination data throughout the commonwealth to ensure duplicate vaccination records are removed and dose classification is correct.‚Äù He said that the C.D.C. had now begun to ‚Äúrectify‚Äù the data.

&gt;‚ÄùThis is not a practice specific to Pennsylvania and the C.D.C. is going through a similar process with other states across the country,‚Äù he said.

&gt;Cindy Prins, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida, said she feared that people might jump to the conclusion that there were deliberate errors in the initial reporting, but she did not believe that was the case. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs just a process of cleaning up and making sure what is in there is accurate to the best of our ability to know that,‚Äù Dr. Prins said.

&gt;Still, without fully accurate and up-to-date vaccination rates, it would be difficult for counties to make informed health recommendations, she said. If vaccination rates were overreported, that could give counties a false sense of confidence that more people are vaccinated than actually were.

&gt;More than 230 million people across the United States have received at least one shot of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the C.D.C. Last week, the agency authorized booster shots for all adults. Across the U.S., Covid-19 infections have been rising, with more than 90,000 cases reported on average each day.

Starting Wednesday, ticket inspectors on public transportation networks in Germany began conducting random checks of passengers‚Äô proof of vaccination, recovery from Covid or a negative daily test, as Germany confronts a worrying rise in its caseload.

&gt;Masks have been mandatory on public transportation since the early days of the pandemic, but transportation providers ‚Äî and the current minister of transport ‚Äî have pushed back against calls to require passengers to show proof of immunity to ride.

&gt;The decision to take the extra step was made last week when Parliament voted on a law proposed by the parties that are poised to take over the government after September‚Äôs election. The law also stipulates similar rules for the workplace.

&gt;On Tuesday, German health authorities registered 66,884 new cases, a daily record, and the country‚Äôs Covid death toll is nearing 100,000.

&gt;Documents will be checked at random, mostly by people responsible for checking tickets, although the police can be called in to help. Deutsche Bahn, Germany‚Äôs national railroad, said it would aim to run spot checks on 400 of its routes every day.

&gt;Children younger than 6 and schoolchildren, who are tested for Covid several times a week with their classes, are excluded. Other riders must prove either that they are fully vaccinated, that they have recovered from the disease less than six months ago or that they have a negative test result from an official testing site that is less than 24 hours old.

I don't know which part of the state you live in, but Covid and other respiratory infections are going gangbusters up around my part of North Jersey.

In the last three weeks, 12 of my friends tested positive for covid, only one of them is unvaccinated. Two have already received boosters. Since I was in close contact with nearly all of them shortly before they tested positive, I was nervously counting down the days before it was my turn. I started to feel sick last Thursday, but have thus far tested negative on 3 rapid tests and two PCR's, so something else ended up getting me (ended up being strep + bronchitis) while Covid tagged the others. 

On top of that, a pattern emerged with those who ended up testing positive. Their symptoms matched whichever seasonal malady they usually get this time of year, for a few it was allergies, for others it was Sinusitis, and for another it was just fatigue and headaches. They all tested negative when they first started feeling off, and in a few cases again after a few days just to be sure, so seeing those negative results and believing it was just their usual seasonal bullshit, they kept coming out to events or going out to the bar on Saturdays. They only finally tested positive when they got tested again out of an abundance of caution when they heard that others they were around tested positive recently.

&amp;#x200B;

I've taken covid **extremely seriously** as someone with asthma. I'm fully vaccinated with a booster. I still wear an n95 mask when in public. I stayed mostly completely isolated with my wife for most of 2020. I was the only one in my office who wore a mask at my desk 8 hours a day last winter.

We literally spent Christmas on Zoom exchanging presents. My life did not return to any semblance of normalcy until this spring when my family and I got vaccinated. I have close friends and family who work in the ICU telling me first hand horror stories about covid. My close friends mother died on a vent a few months ago (fully vaxxed too, old with health issues). I've gotten into countless arguments with people on social media and on reddit with people who actually didn't take covid seriously. I've literally been a vocal proponent of following the rules, listening to public health officials, getting vaccinated and doing everything you can to personally limit the impact of this pandemic.

Perhaps you should make less assumptions about someone after taking two minutes to browse through their comment history. The fact of the matter is now, at this point, the pandemic is over for me. I still think about it every day. Probably too much. I don't want covid. Even vaccinated I know it will be rough for me. But me, my wife, my sister and my elderly mother are all boosted.

With fast-track visas and promises of permanent residency, many of the wealthy nations that drive the global economy are sending a message to skilled immigrants all over the world: Help wanted. Now.

&gt;In Germany, where officials recently warned that the country needs 400,000 new immigrants a year to fill jobs in fields ranging from academia to air-conditioning, a new Immigration Act offers accelerated work visas and six months to visit and find a job.

&gt;Canada plans to give residency to 1.2 million new immigrants by 2023. Israel recently finalized a deal to bring health care workers from Nepal. And in Australia, where mines, hospitals and pubs are all short-handed after nearly two years with a closed border, the government intends to roughly double the number of immigrants it allows into the country over the next year.

&gt;The global drive to attract foreigners with skills, especially those that fall somewhere between physical labor and a physics Ph.D., aims to smooth out a bumpy recovery from the pandemic.

&gt;Covid‚Äôs disruptions have pushed many people to retire, resign or just not return to work. But its effects run deeper. By keeping so many people in place, the pandemic has made humanity‚Äôs demographic imbalance more obvious ‚Äî rapidly aging rich nations produce too few new workers, while countries with a surplus of young people often lack work for all.

&gt;New approaches to that mismatch could influence the worldwide debate over immigration. European governments remain divided on how to handle new waves of asylum seekers. In the United States, immigration policy remains mostly stuck in place, with a focus on the Mexican border, where migrant detentions have reached a record high.

&gt;Still, many developed nations are building more generous, efficient and sophisticated programs to bring in foreigners and help them become a permanent part of their societies.

&gt;‚ÄùCovid is an accelerator of change,‚Äù said Jean-Christophe Dumont, the head of international migration research for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or O.E.C.D. ‚ÄúCountries have had to realize the importance of migration and immigrants.‚Äù

Young males infected with the virus are up 6 times more likely to develop myocarditis as those who have received the vaccine.)

Of note, only 8 of these 23 patients had cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) for diagnosis and none of them histopathological evidence (probable myocarditis).)

Keep in mind that the vaccine trials were done very fast, with the imperative of producing a good vaccine to deal with the pandemic.  They designed the trials to produce viable data, but did not have the luxury of figuring out optimal dosing strategies, storage, etc.  Everything was done to get safe, effective vaccines into arms as quickly as possible.

If the trial designers had the luxury of time, they likely would have spaced out the doses for the mRNA vaccines out much than a few weeks, probably similar to the dosing schedule for childhood vaccines (e.g., six months between shots).  They likely wouldn't have considered J&amp;J a ""one shot"" vaccine but would likely require two or more shots (there are very, very few single shot vaccines; most vaccines require multiple shots).  Probably all the COVID vaccines, ideally, would be two shots, spaced six months apart, for maximum durable effectiveness.  But we don't live in an ideal world.

[Here's Peter Hotez talking about the dosing schedule](https://twitter.com/PeterHotez/status/1463116132479643655).  He argues that the two closely spaced 1st and 2nd doses probably is seen by the immune system as a single bad infection, so it's less necessary to mount a sustained immune response.

Yes, this is called triage, and is typically used for emergency events. 

&gt;We have already thought about it, and at no point has a reputable person ever said ""lets decide if they deserve treatment""

Many times triage is used to decide if someone deserves treatment or not based on their condition, and likelihood of survival.

Perhaps you would like to do some reading about how organ recipients are selected. Hint: they pick and choose who receives organs based on many factors including lifestyle decisions.

Now consider that widespread hospitalization from a virus that has a highly preventative vaccine is not an emergency, and the influx of unvaccinated patients is burning out staff and depleting the overall quality of care for all other patients. Why are the ignorant unvaxxed more deserving of care than someone who was in a car accident, or had a heart attack?

You can dislike that point as much as you want but it is just the way it works, medical ethics isn't something we're figuring out on the fly.

&gt;Still a higher risk with COVID itself

I fully acknowledge that the incidence rate for myocarditis is higher with getting COVID than the vaccine. This is one of the reasons I still got vaccinated as a young male, despite some anxiety around vaccine induced myocarditis (I've struggled with anxiety about my heart pre COVID, mind you).

My only point is that we should present our arguments for the vaccines *honestly*, and acknowledge risk propery, i.e. stratify data for age when discussing vaccine induced myocarditis.

10.69 in 100,000 is 1 in 10,000, not far off what I posted (1 in 6000, source: https://www.science.org/content/article/israel-reports-link-between-rare-cases-heart-inflammation-and-covid-19-vaccination). It's still much higher than the overall incidence rate when you don't stratify for age, because it's a much more rare adverse effect in other demographics.

The reason I replied to the OP is because inaccurately arguing for the vaccine can help anti-vaxxers argument; we have to stick to honesy.",,,,,,,,,1637771707,,,{},hlx1ph6,False,t3_r0sk04,False,False,t1_hlwujtz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r0sk04/the_real_risk_of_heart_inflammation_to_kids_is/hlx1ph6/,,7,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1638144690.0,

Again, that is exactly my point. At no point does a doctor or nurse try to examine a patients social media or personal life to try to determine if they are an anti-vaxer and deny treatment to them based on that. Because that would be obviously unethical.

We call this an appeal to emotion. I'm not saying anti-vaxers are more deserving than someone else. I'm saying that ethically speaking we don't deny treatment to people based on if we think they are deserving.

Who decides what is moral? According to some religions it is immoral to have sex out of wedlock. It is immoral to be gay. What if there is a person just like you but on the opposite side of the political spectrum in a conservative state making the same argument you are. Instead of saying ""they should be vaccinated"" they are saying ""well this pregnant woman and this gay man with a STD could have easily prevented their need for treatment according to my morals, so I'm not going to treat them"".

Also I cannot stress how unlikely it will be that you need vaccines every 6 months. This is another myth like the ""**eternal mutating killer variant coming soon to a theatre near you**"".

Also, CureVac 'drop' (chases activities)  this vaccine candidate (for various reasons, but mainly because the *""overall vaccine efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 of 48¬∑2% ""*). They plan a 'redesigned' version ot their vaccine candidate.   


I copy below what i summarize today ([in another subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/r13kt2/comment/hlwaj30/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) 

&gt;CVnCoV --&gt;&gt; It's the CureVac (Germany) mRNA first vaccine candidate.  
  
Key points ('highlights' selected by myself):  
  
Method:  
  
HERALD is a randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 2b/3 clinical trial conducted in 47 centres in ten countries in Europe and Latin America. By use of an interactive web response system and stratification by country and age group (18‚Äì60 years and ‚â•61 years), adults with no history of virologically confirmed COVID-19 were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intramuscularly either two 0¬∑6 mL doses of CVnCoV containing 12 Œºg of mRNA or two 0¬∑6 mL doses of 0¬∑9% NaCl (placebo) on days 1 and 29.  
  
Findings:  
  
Between Dec 11, 2020, and April 12, 2021, 39‚Äâ680 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either CVnCoV (n=19‚Äâ846) or placebo (n=19‚Äâ834), of whom 19‚Äâ783 received at least one dose of CVnCoV and 19‚Äâ746 received at least one dose of placebo.  
  
After a mean observation period of 48¬∑2 days (SE 0¬∑2), 83 cases of COVID-19 occurred in the CVnCoV group (n=12‚Äâ851) in 1735¬∑29 person-years and 145 cases occurred in the placebo group (n=12‚Äâ211) in 1569¬∑87 person-years, **resulting in an overall vaccine efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 of 48¬∑2%** (95¬∑826% CI 31¬∑0‚Äì61¬∑4; p=0¬∑016).  
  
**Vaccine efficacy against moderate-to-severe COVID-19 was 70¬∑7%** (95% CI 42¬∑5‚Äì86¬∑1; CVnCoV 12 cases in 1735¬∑29 person-years, placebo 37 cases in 1569¬∑87 person-years).  
  
In participants aged **18‚Äì60 years, vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease was 52¬∑5%** (95% CI 36¬∑2‚Äì64¬∑8; CVnCoV 71 cases in 1591¬∑47 person-years, placebo, 136 cases in 1449¬∑23 person-years).  
  
**Too few cases occurred in participants aged 61 years or older (CVnCoV 12, placebo nine) to allow meaningful assessment of vaccine efficacy.**  
  
Solicited adverse events, which were mostly systemic, were more common in CVnCoV recipients (1933 \[96¬∑5%\] of 2003) than in placebo recipients (1344 \[67¬∑9%\] of 1978), with 542 (27¬∑1%) CVnCoV recipients and 61 (3¬∑1%) placebo recipients reporting grade 3 solicited adverse events.  
  
Interpretation:  
  
CVnCoV was efficacious in the prevention of COVID-19 of any severity and had an acceptable safety profile. **Taking into account the changing environment, including the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, and timelines for further development, the decision has been made to cease activities on the CVnCoV candidate and to focus efforts on the development of next-generation vaccine candidates.**  
  
  
  
Note: i'm not the OP.  
  
May relevant add-on information about CureVac CVnCoV and CV2CoV (from CureVac official press releases):  
  
""CureVac to Shift Focus of COVID-19 Vaccine Development to Second-Generation mRNA Technology"" (October 12, 2021)  
  
""announced the **strategic decision to focus its COVID-19 vaccine development towards the development of second-generation mRNA vaccine candidates in collaboration with GSK and to withdraw its first-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate**, CVnCoV, from the current approval process with the European Medicines Agency (EMA)""  
  
""CureVac Publishes in Nature Preclinical Data of Second-Generation COVID-19 Candidate, CV2CoV, Demonstrating Comparable Antibody Levels to Licensed mRNA Vaccine"" (November 18, 2021)  
  
""announced the online publication of the extended preclinical study of the second-generation vaccine candidate, CV2CoV, jointly developed with GSK, in the journal Nature. The newly published data features a direct comparison of CV2CoV with the licensed mRNA vaccine, Comirnaty¬Æ (Pfizer/BioNTech). Neutralizing antibody levels measured following full vaccination of animals with either 12¬µg of CV2CoV or a 30¬µg standard dose of Comirnaty¬Æ were shown to be highly comparable.""",,,,,,,,,1637777206,,,{},hlxfsb7,False,t3_r13leg,False,True,t1_hlw9mra,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r13leg/efficacy_and_safety_of_the_cvncov_sarscov2_mrna/hlxfsb7/,,3,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1638152609.0,

&gt;In many cases there will be instances where there is not enough data known and doctors can disagree

Now I am addressing what you said:

&gt;I think doctors should only lose their license if they are recommending something dangerous. Ivermectin is only dangerous if in the wrong amount. 

This is a perfect example of what I am trying to say. We know that Ivermectin has been approved for humans to fight parasites. But there has been know peer reviews data that has shown it is effective in testing covid. Hell, for all we know, it could be more dangerous for people who have covid. We simply do not have the data to support this one way or another. So rather than saying ivermectin is dangerous or helpful for covid patients, the goal of my comment was to prevent doctors from making any claims without ample peer reviewed data to support their claims. 

We simply don‚Äôt know how ivermectin impacts a covid patient, so at this time we shouldn‚Äôt recommend it. We should study it more to find out. But any doctor currently recommending it is not doing so based on any scientific analysis. Covid has become highly politicized and is subject to conspiracy theories and a drastic misunderstanding of science and disease. We can‚Äôt afford to let doctors publicly make unsubstantiated claims based on political ideology and compound the confusion even further. Doctors should err on the side of caution and simply say, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have enough meaningful evidence that Ivermectin is effective. So don‚Äôt take it until we have a better understanding.‚Äù

On the other hand, hundreds of millions of people have had the vaccines without serious side effects or death. There is a plethora of double blind, randomized, peer reviewed research showing the effectiveness of vaccines and how they reduce the transmission and seriousness of symptoms of covid. All doctors should be recommending the vaccines based on this plethora of evidence. But not only that, but all doctors should pay attention to and seek out the constantly changing body of evidence as more studies are conducted about the various aspects of covid, mutations, vaccine effectiveness, boosters, etc. sure there is a lot of stuff that we don‚Äôt know yet and might not ever learn, but there is certainly enough there for doctors to point people in the right direction without making unsubstantiated claims.",9c52615e38e40b7aebb32fc62fa0a31d9d44cbd5,True,False,,,,,0.0,1637777077,,0.0,{},hlxfgfh,False,t3_r0j8lx,False,True,t1_hlx9fbr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/r0j8lx/seven_doctors_contract_covid_after_attending/hlxfgfh/,1637777093.0,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,,,
