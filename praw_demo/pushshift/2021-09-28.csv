And economy pretty much wins always, even in the cases of states that are stricter on mask usage and the like. In all cases, nothing seriously drastic is done that would upset the economy, *as it currently operates,* in a big way. As in, we aren't paying for people, or providing people the material resources, to stay home for a while, comfortably. And without that, it's untenable for most people not to work. And those who run some of the essential parts of the economy (meat packing plants, factories etc.) aren't willing to invest in the time and money to truly make them safe places to work in the meantime.   


So, understandably, as this has been going on for more than a year, people get sick of it, and resign themselves to the idea that people are just going to die. It has all been mentally debilitating, experiencing sociality like this for so long, and I often find that it doesn't even feel quite real. The idea of a virus is abstract enough in the present that it's hard to connect to concrete reality.   


But I think it's important to remember that so much of the confusion and conflict stems from policy failure. I truly believe it's because you fundamentally can't prioritize people's health to a strong enough degree because of the precedence that the economy takes, especially in the United States. I guess I'll say I am mostly speaking for the United States as my knowledge about how it is going in the rest of the world is minimal.",,,,1632890735,{},heoqpx0,False,t3_px0qu4,False,True,t1_henrh4q,/r/Coronavirus/comments/px0qu4/daily_discussion_thread_september_28_2021/heoqpx0/,1633034468.0,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think mostly a guy like LeBron knows a ton of very smart, educated folks, and possibly has access to the biggest experts in the field of epidemiology and vaccines if he were to make a few phone calls.

There are many important factors in understanding how vaccines work, but here are a few:

* History
* Science/biology behind them, especially how they provoke an immune response and how they sustain it.
* Types of vaccines in use today: MRNA, DNA, Viral Vector, etc. how they differ and what their goals are and if they're different in anyway
* Statistics: this is the most critical piece. People don't know how statistics work and how they relate to how trials are performed to gauge both safety and efficacy. People don't understand why you have a control group and a test group, what large numbers mean... what the efficacy numbers mean.
* Numbers are also critical in seeing how the vaccine is fairing against different variants and also understanding why people vaccinated are still getting infected.

There are just too many things here to understand that a guy like LeBron doesn't have the time or interest to fully grasp.

You can't say something is rampant just because it happened in your immediate vicinity. That's like saying there is rampant hunger just because you're hungry, and then hunger is solved because you ate lunch. You are you, and the people around you are one group of people. You are not the world.

I'm not ignoring inconvenient or uncomfortable data, because you haven't presented any. You presented a single data point, which doesn't tell us anything about what's happening in the world at large.

Those masks are usually used at work places, if you go grocery shopping for 20 minutes its reasonably understandable that this doesnt equal a shift of 8 hours. Of course you shouldnt wear them anymore once they show physical damages, different color/stains or get moist (let it dry). Look at them properly each time before putting them on. Avoid touching the surfaces of the mask.

the nk95s can be reused aswell, up to 5 times. how? hang them between each use for 7 days, at the 7th day they can be used again OR treat them with heat. how? put them in a plasticbag, get rid of the air inside, close it properly. put enough water in a cooking pot so the bag doesnt touch the ground. when it boils put the bag inside, close with a lid, wait 10 minutes. then get it out and hang it again (dont leave it in the bag). you can do this maximum of 3 times. alternatively you can put the mask in oven for 60 minutes at 80¬∞C=175F. this can be done 5 times. this is based on a study of a german university, source in german https://www.fh-muenster.de/gesundheit/downloads/forschung/ffp2/02_ffp2_info25022021_doppelseiten.pdf

This is absolute fantasy thinking. And insulting people is going to convince them how wrong they are about *anything*. Notice how my condescending tone here has made you defensive and immediately averse to my argument.  
 
If people really cared about turning their deaths into messaging that might save other's lives, they'd tell their story to as many people as they could reach and say it could happen to *you*. They'd need to go to these vaccine hesitant people, in particular people who knew the deceased, and pry on them.  
Getting together with a bunch of other already vaccinated people in a particular subreddit as yet *another* social media bubble of groupthink is not going to change minds beyond the maybe dozen or so posts in that sub saying as much.   
 
It's just another hate sub dressed up in self-righteousness which, like all hate groups, believes *that* other is okay to hate and gloat over.

Pls forgive back of napkin math.  I may be totally off base with this.   
 From what I could find as an example.  In California there have been a total of 35 deaths in Children 0-17 in California, 10 of these being 0-5.  There were 88 deaths of vaccinated individuals.  

[https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-19-Cases-by-Age-Group.aspx](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-19-Cases-by-Age-Group.aspx)

So California has a death rate of .38 per 100k of vaccinated and a death rate of .38 per 100k of children 0-17.  The death rate for 0-5 would be .33 per 100k.

So 0-5 children have a lower death rate than vaccinated adults as a whole and my assumption is that if I could find a breakdown of breakthrough deaths by age we would find the 40+ vaccinated death rate is higher than the .38 for the group as a whole.",,,,1632872846,{},henr33b,False,t3_px4c8i,False,True,t1_hemsedf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/px4c8i/pfizer_seeks_fda_authorization_for_covid_vaccine/henr33b/,1633014756.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

What I see is much less death during this wave then the last.  The last had masks but more deaths.  This had some masks some not and a lot of vaccines.  The only variable is the vaccine.

Yeah I think we should have waited until after new years to unmask... but would it really matter?  People aren't masking around their family at all anymore if they are it's a very small minority.

Of course the COVID infections may be underestimated, but looking forward as a virus mutating much slower and with the amount of people vaccinated, it doesn't seem far-fetched that the amount of re-infections per year from now on will not significantly exceed 10%.

And I don't know about you, but I have never heard of ""long flu"". It does seem to be a thing, but ""twice the risk of this thing you never heard about"" isn't super frightening to me.

I don't want to downplay that this is something that should be kept an eye on, definitely. But looking at it like this, the results from this study are not exactly apocalyptic; I would even go as far and say they are reassuring.

I cannot count the times I have had arguments around things like helmet laws, seatbelt laws, or just traffic laws in general. 

In the great state of South Carolina, at least the portion in which I am currently located, traffic laws appear to only apply to whomever is unlucky enough to raise the ire of the badge at that moment in time. Traffic lights are a suggestion, even if there‚Äôs a cop sitting at the light. Intersections are blocked because folks think they have a right to pull forward when traffic is backed up (primarily because some other douche canoe ahead did the same at another light up the road). School speed zones are for the weak. Etc, so forth. 

This fighting against a so-called paternalistic state is laughable. The reason these laws, much like business regulations, exist is because enough dumbfucks caused enough damage to warrant it.

There was ABSOLUTELY healthcare hesitancy in the black community before covid. With good reason - there's a lot of evidence that black people are treated more poorly by the healthcare system. They're more likely to have poorer treatment, to not have their pain taken seriously, and to be seen as drug seeking - even when adjusted for wealth. Black women are 3 to 4 times more likely to die from birthing complications according to the CDC. And white Americans are more than twice as likely to be prescribed opiods despite more black Americans reporting chronic pain (sources at bottom)

Personally I think Tuskegee is a simple to understand, well known, and powerful example to point to in the face of all the deeper, more complex problems and lesser well known tragedies. There is credence that [people are using historical racism to promote rhetoric and conspiracy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Racism:_The_New_Apartheid). But it's manipulation of [real historical pain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Apartheid).

Imo the hesitancy is a tragedy, but it's coming from a very different place and needs to be addressed very differently.

We now know that the health impacts of covid on this age group were overstated and that the vaccine effectiveness was overstated (transmission and efficacy over time).  Most of the analysis was on if the vaccine was safe which I think it is and not whether it was really needed.  I see the same hand waving for the younger age groups now.  

Overall it seems the narrative at some point shifted from a pandemic of unknowns into entrenched political positions each with their own misleading propaganda.

When they first closed schools here back in March of 2020, it was done very sloppily and with too much haste in my opinion (they waited till the eleventh hour‚Äîthey should have done it sooner but also given parents time to make arrangements in the meantime). People were left with a day‚Äôs notice to coordinate childcare, what to do about work, tech for virtual learning/Internet, needs for SPED students, and needs for students who rely on school for two meals a day. 

They finally started to get some of their shit together by working deals out with a local Internet provider, handing out hotspots, providing iPads/laptops or paper packets for those in which virtual was absolutely not an option, and a ‚Äúfood bus‚Äù for some time until they decided food had to be picked up from different hubs instead of delivered to the regular school bus stops for whatever reason. Some of these decisions and efforts took longer than others. 

What I think some of the schools implemented that was a good decision was that for children who were most adversely affected by the schools closing, such as specials needs children who rely on in-school therapies and children whose parents could not coordinate childcare (or had other very real problems that made virtual learning damn near impossible) for different, confirmed reasons (poverty, access, etc.), the schools would form very small cohorts to teach in-person at the school(s). Teachers and most students‚Äîconditions allowing, were masked, and screened for COVID daily. This continued through the end of the school year. 

When last school year began, we started with A/B weeks where half the school would go one week, then the other. We were doing a hell of a lot better last year COVID- and quarantine-case wise than we currently are‚Äîeven by last winter‚Äôs numbers. Everyone is going to school right now, no every-other-day or week, and most classrooms are at or close to capacity. Teachers and students are under a mask mandate currently, however I do not know if that will be revisited at some point later in the year. 

Anywho, sorry I rambled. The gist is I think closing/limiting exposure is an option, especially in high risk and exposure areas, and also more can be done for kids and parents who are harmed more by these closings than others. I was really disappointed when our school didn‚Äôt start out with A/B weeks this year, but they didn‚Äôt announce the mask mandate until a week or so before the first day, so honestly what should I have expected, right? I doubt most schools will implement any such measures, like A/B days or weeks unless things get reallyyyyyy bad. 

Just my experience and 2¬¢. Be well.",,,,1632887383,{},heol3tp,False,t3_pvpr01,False,True,t1_hebzcvl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pvpr01/portland_school_board_will_consider_vaccine/heol3tp/,1633031413.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; The US public private partnerships tend to result in one sided gains for Private corporations at the expense of american public health.

Sure, I agree. But only for those things that are addictive and kill you slowly - High fructose corn syrup, as you mentioned. Money is the bottom line, and yes, the addiction to sugar does indeed lead to higher profits, even at the expense of a decreased lifespan. Now let's think about the vaccine, and play devil's advocate. We know that millions around the world have taken the vaccine. Is the vaccine addictive? No. Two shots and you're done, with maybe a booster needed every year, just like how you take vaccine shots every year anyways. Nothing out of the ordinary. 

Two possibilities. Intentional and Non-intentional:

Intentional:

Now let's say the vaccines were intentionally designed to kill us - slowly or fast, doesn't matter. What's the net benefit monetarily here? Not much. We know everyone has to take it. How could anybody benefit from killing off the entire population that they need to be alive in order to function as a society, that also are NOT dependent/addicted to the vaccine like with corn syrup in a way that provides substantial monetary gain? And on top of that, the vaccines are free! 

&gt; There were early fears that heart problems were arising from the vaccines. Black americans have long family histories with heart problems.

Another devil's advocate. Could it be remotely possible that the creators of the vaccine grouped up and said ""let's make this so that it fucks over black people *specifically*"". No. Not a chance. That would require untold more amounts of money and research to cause such effects amongst primarily black people, and not so much in other races. Occam's razor, my friend.

Unintentional:

Let's say the vaccine was unintentionally dangerous in that yes, the product causes some deaths by heart attacks or whatever. Fine. I can see this happening. Well then it is on the black person to start critically thinking. They need to determine HOW many and what percentage of deaths. The media loves to blow things out of proportion and so they will only say ""X vaccine increases risk for heart attack!!!!1!1!1!!"" and the black person will see that and think, well, fuck that, I'm out. If the black person is not willing to look further, then who is to blame? And what is the alternative? They can clearly see how many people are dying. Do they want to be part of that statistic? It's easy to search online and do your ""research"". Now you can bring up the point that maybe the black person cannot afford to do this research, or are uneducated, indoctrinated, whatever. Sure, then yes, I agree with you, that is out of their control. But a man such as Lebron James who can afford to buy probably every computer in the US, fuck it, buy a personal research scientist, how is it not laughable that he was skeptical about this?",,,,1632876942,{},henzrv7,False,t3_pxc6hb,False,False,t1_hemnm73,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pxc6hb/lebron_james_reveals_hes_vaccinated_i_was/henzrv7/,1633019612.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pick a different vaccine.

See above.

You can pay for an expensive test or take an extremely safe and free shot.

A [third dose](https://investors.modernatx.com/static-files/c43de312-8273-4394-9a58-a7fc7d5ed098) might improve that all by another factor of [as much as 10x](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01377-8), but it will give you the best effect if there's been a longer time since the second dose.  Moderna's trials were all done at 6-8 months and with a half-dose (close to Pfizer's current dose).

If you're in your twenties and vaccinated the risk to you (hospitalization/death) if you do catch COVID is very, very small.  If you have family that's much older it is they who are at higher risk.

The issue is you're taking away a first dose from someone elsewhere in the world.

Additionally, are samples from vaccinated people who get infected containing viable virus, or just shredded parts? 

Another thing to consider is... well... OF COURSE they're the same CT value, you're sampling their nose, *where the infection gets started!*  Do vaccinated people make enough infectious virus in their nose before the immune system kicks in in order to spread it? The few studies that looked to culture virus from vaccinated people with infections had a hard time getting any viable virus.

[],,red_nuts,,,[],,,,text,t2_5nb9a,False,False,[],"You are being told that it's poorly messaged, because conservatives have political reasons for wanting you to believe that. It's bullshit. The CDC communicates all their recommendations on their website. Not saying you're a conservative, but talking shit about the CDC is a conservative talking point, it forms a big part of performative conservatism these days, and it helps form the backstory to a huge scam which is making COVID grifters rich.

The CDC may or may not communicate about the relative frequency of how often vaccinated people spread COVID relative to the unvaccinated. That's because the CDC takes good research from everywhere, they don't necessarily do or fund that research themselves.

In this case, the research comes from many places around the world, where they measure real-world breakthrough infections. In Israel, for example, one study shows that 0.2% of COVID cases were breakthrough infections. The CDC looks at a lot of information, and the real-world facts on the ground data that we have shows that our vaccines are highly effective. The CDC doesn't have to publish that information, or tell you about it. Their job is to be the experts, to know what the research is telling us, to participate in the scientific community of experts, and to communicate their recommendations to us.

As lay-people, you and I should be interested in the reasons why the CDC makes the recommendations. But you and I should also understand - deeply understand - that we are not the experts, and our conclusions are going to be completely WRONG 99 times out of 100 if we ignore what the CDC says.

""they should have never reinstated mandated masking for fully vaccinated people""

You don't know that. They are the experts and qualified to interpret the data. You on the other hand are a dude on the Internet. Are you a welder? Are you a bank manager? Day trader? Chemical engineer? Fuck if I know, but the chance that you are an expert who is just in-between jobs working for the CDC is very very low. I'm a software engineer, and extremely smart. In fact, I'm smart enough to know that a) infectious disease isn't my field and b) if I disagree with an expert in infectious diseases then I am the one who is wrong.

There was a significant difference in how the two groups fared in july/august 2021, which they looked at specifically to limit results to delta. The severe disease breakthrough in 65+ was nearly tripled, and 18-64 it was about 50% higher.

Unfortunately they didn't have a control group of unvaccinated and doing a suitable comparison of the overall VE would be a whole paper itself, but it does clearly establish that protection wanes in a time dependent manner, and show we absolutely need a booster at some point. But the FDA probably wants to play games and wait until *after* we can perfect the timeline by observing the increase in the general population, rather than get ahead of it because it's clearly starting.

The main differences between the ONS analysis and this study are:

* The ONS used a 4-week window to look for symptoms in, this study used a 3-month window to reach the 37% figure

* This study includes 3 symptoms that the ONS analysis does not - ""cognitive symptoms"", ""anxiety/depression"" and ""other pain""

* The equivalent figure for the ONS analysis would be 5.0%, not 3.0% - the 3% figure is the ONS estimate for people with continuous symptoms, whereas this study is looking at people who experienced a symptom at least once. I agree that in general the rate of people with continuous symptoms is more relevant, but for the purposes of comparison, let's compare like with like

So once you factor in that this study looked for symptoms in a window that's 3 times longer, and looked for a wider array of symptoms (including anxiety/depression, which was this most widely reported single symptom in this study), then 5% and 37% look a bit less far apart from each other.",,,,1632871967,{},henp7dl,False,t3_pxce1v,False,False,t1_hemqxud,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pxce1v/covid_37_of_people_have_symptoms_six_months_after/henp7dl/,1633013714.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The booster doesn't just give a slight boost for ""peace of mind"" as Singer puts it. It raises people's protection against Delta from &lt;50% to &gt;95%, an incredibly significant increase that could save millions from getting sick. While a lot of anti-booster arguments center around the important fact that the vaccines, despite their reduced efficacy against disease, still provide significant protection against hospitalization and death, that paints an incomplete picture and disregards the seriousness of post-covid disabilities that affect many people after mild to moderate cases.

In addition, the argument presents a false dichotomy between giving doses and vaccinating the rest of the world. Vaccine production has ramped up significantly, and we're at the point where production exceeds demand. The solution to vaccinating the rest of the world isn't as simple as the US just shipping off its stockpile; logistical ""last-mile"" problems in poorer countries are a much larger roadblock to getting the whole world vaccinated. Not to mention that the doses do have an expiration date, and the US's stockpile surely has plenty of doses that wouldn't last long enough to actually help poorer countries before they expire.

Every pharmacy in the US is literally dumping unused doses down the drain every single day. The better alternative is to recognize that the current data shows that two doses just doesn't cut it anymore and fully vaccinate those for whom vaccination is readily accessible, while at the same time still doing everything possible to work toward getting the rest of the world vaccinated.

Back in May, when the CDC advised vaxxed people to (mostly) unmask, ages 12-15 had only just become eligible, with zero time to get fully vaxxed. Delta lurked in the shadows as well, having already wreaked havoc in India and worrying Israel and the UK.

Almost all of us unmasked - vaxxed or not. That loosening did not go well.

My county's under a mask mandate. Before they loosen up, I hope they look at vaccination rates, hospitalizations and deaths (2-week plateau or 2-week drop) and that they allow the youngest eligibles sufficient time  for a significant number to get fully vaxxed (2 months).

There's a reason that lab had the data on the closest relative to the virus. That it started in Wuhan, a fair bit away from the range of the likely spillover bat species but where the bat coronavirus lab was located, is actually significant evidence of a lab leak. Most people falsely equate evidence with proof or with coincidence. It's certainly not conclusive proof, and all evidence can be parsed as a coincidence. One of the major reasons non-CT nutjobs latched onto lab leak was that they were spammed with ""there's no evidence"", when the very first factoid we knew about the virus was indeed evidence. It was also quite clear the WHO was being obsequious to China when the outbreak started. Also Daszak ordering a premature pledge from scientists to say it definitely didn't come from a lab (before anyone could evaluate that) was gross, and you didn't need to be a CT nutjob to smell a conspiracy there.

[],,Umpass-stay,,,[],,,,text,t2_ax30660c,False,False,[],"Coronavirus infections that start in the mouth or nose gain their foothold in the higher part of the nasal passages where food and drink don't go unless you accidentally choke or it ""goes down the wrong pipe"". This is why droplets and aerosols cause infection - the act of inhaling brings these tiny molecules all the way up to the top of the nasal tract virtually unencumbered. Coronavirus is pretty sticky, so once it attaches itself to a surface, it's not going to just float off. It takes a disturbance or force. If you put food or drink in your mouth that has particles of coronavirus attached to it, the overwhelmingly likelihood is that it stays attached to the food and you swallow it. We're getting really theoretical here, but if it somehow moves from the food, the most likely destination is your saliva. That's still not going all the way up your nasal tract. It's almost definitely going down your throat or out your mouth. In any case, coronavirus entering your mouth/nose is much more scary in droplet or aerosol form than attached a physical object that is ground up and swallowed with the help of your saliva. This doesn't even touch on viral load which is another huge factor in a successful infection. COVID happens when you inhale a bunch of aerosols or droplets and the viral load is big enough to overcome your body's defenses. This is why you can probably converse with an infected person for a minute or so and not be in trouble, but spending 15 minutes talking to them puts you in a lot more danger. Now if someone with COVID literally coughs or sneezes on your food and hands it directly to you, yeah, that's a problem. But such a huge chain of unlikely events has to happen for you to get sick from food. Someone capable of spreading COVID has to cough/sneeze/breathe more than enough coronavirus onto your food to make you sick. Enough virus to make you sick has to successfully attach to your food. Then, enough virus to make you sick has to survive on your food until you eat it. When you eat it, enough virus to make you sick has to detach itself from your food and stay in your mouth/throat without being swallowed. Then, enough virus to make you sick has to make its way high up in your nasal tract, even though it's not aerosolized or in a form very capable of doing so. It's not an impossibility, but it's so incredibly unlikely that it's not something to stress about.",,,,1632893245,{},heouh47,False,t3_px0qu4,False,True,t1_heor8qq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/px0qu4/daily_discussion_thread_september_28_2021/heouh47/,1633036537.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The YouTube algorithm is messed right up. Im I‚Äôm about as pro vaccine as you can get and my YouTube history should show that. But my feed always has antivax shit mixed in. For example Russel Brand, fairly tame antivax sympathizer. I was curious so I clicked on a couple of them. But made sure to thumbs down and I definitely never subscribed. But he‚Äôs always near the top of my feed. Every night. I also see other more conspiratorial ones sprinkled throughout.

It‚Äôs enough to make you wonder if there‚Äôs another reason. But it‚Äôs probably because I used to be subbed to Joe Rogan (dropped him after he came out as antivax) I‚Äôm also into MMA channels. (rampant with antivaxxer types) and yea my guilty pleasure, Aliens‚Ä¶But I‚Äôm subbed to plenty of quality science channels and have watched tons videos that should suggest I‚Äôm pro vaccine. 

Why am I getting antivax shit still?? I refuse to believe they‚Äôre doing it on purpose. It‚Äôs Silicon Valley for crying out loud. The algorithm is straight broken. Like we‚Äôre accidentally brainwashing people here, it‚Äôs insane! 

Both my parents, total liberal hippies. Walking around naked all the time in the 80s (it was gross). Radicalized by YouTube rabbit holes. They‚Äôre climate change deniers, pro gun, anti abortion, anti Muslim, the whole works man. They‚Äôre were on FB too. But I know for a fact it was more YouTube that FB. Pumping out the outrage because it encourages binge watching. Unbelievable incompetence on the part of YouTube. They created a huge god damn problem in the name of money and it‚Äôs going to bite us all. Facebook too they‚Äôre as much to blame I‚Äôm sure. You‚Äôre not getting rid of either platform, that‚Äôs a pipe dream. All we can do is hope they can fix it. Deleting antivax videos is a good step in the right direction. Hope the do more.

I thought I might find myself in a similar situation because I have a cousin that was (is?) very antivax. However, he did get vaccinated against COVID.

I haven't asked him what changed his mind, but I suspect it had to do with his initial reason for being antivax, which had something to do with the diseases at issues not being active threats (measles, for example, notwithstanding that measles is coming back because of anti-vaxxers like him). There was also the normal BS about vaccines not being safely tested and big pharma profits and the like, but that all paled in comparison to the very real threat of COVID.

I live in the Netherlands but my partner lives in Portugal. I didn't travel here very much during the worst parts of the pandemic, but post-vaccine, I have been able to come here a bit more often. The Netherlands is a more individualistic culture than Portugal, it's much closer to the US in fact. I am using the [Hofstede Insights](https://www.hofstede-insights.com/country-comparison/) as my source of ""individualistic"", by the way.

It is most certainly the case that the Portuguese follow the rules and guidance more closely than the Dutch. There were so many protests, people not wearing masks in stores despite a mandate, and conspiracy theories copied verbatim from the US in NL that it was sometimes painful paying attention to news during the worst parts of the pandemic. In Portugal I cannot even recall a time when I saw someone with the mask hanging under their nose. And they are still wearing it despite the high vaccine numbers! Though that will change soon.

That said, both NL and Portugal have quite high vaccination rates, so it's nice that we don't have as many anti-vax nuts (tho they do exist).

I'm subscribed to the channel of an M.D. on YouTube who discusses COVID-19, vaccines, etc. He is very careful to (repeatedly) point out that he is vaccinated, he has personally vaccinated hundreds of patients, he encourages everyone to speak to their doctor and follow their recommendations, believing that the vaccine is beneficial for the overwhelming majority of people. But, for all that, he has had videos taken down, and worries that it will happen again.  
&gt;  
&gt;Months ago he was insisting that the people who had contracted COVID-19 and who had antibodies in their system may not need the vaccine. Now, we have a number of studies coming out to support that. But months ago that was ""anti-vax"" (employing the slanderous use of the term).  
&gt;  
&gt;People are going to cheer that ""wackos"" will no longer have a platform. It's not the wackos we should be worrying about. It's the stifling of legitimate public debate, the stifling of legitimate voices who find themselves in the minority.

Correct.


There is the additional factor that the younger population has a much lower rate of vaccination. The Delta variant is much more contagious and it has been running through unvaccinated populations like wild fire. This means there's a lot more vulnerable individuals in the younger population.

This really isn't an accurate headline -- the finding from [the actual study](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003773) is that ""36.55% [...] had one or more long-COVID feature recorded [...] between 3 and 6 months""

The difference is that ""have symptoms"" implies an ongoing experience -- i.e. frequent, or at least multiple, occurrences of those symptoms. That's very different from ""experienced the symptoms at least once in a 3 month period"".

As a hypothetical example, if you had abnormal breathing for one day 4 months after getting covid, you would be counted in that 36.55% even if it never happened again -- but most people wouldn't say you ""have symptoms six months after infection"". I doubt most people would consider you to have ""long covid"", because that usually refers to ongoing, recurring symptoms.

By sticking with scientifically accepted theory. You see, there are some of us who actually study the sciences.  And we know something is scientifically accepted either as fact or as plausible theory based on studies being done according to *scientific method*.   


*Scientific method* is a real thing that exists. It‚Äôs not 2 words randomly thrown together on a social media platform. There are criteria that must be met in order to be considered a study done by scientific method. 

For something to be accepted as a scientific research study, rigid criteria must be met that involves ethical as well as scientific standards. It involves large test group, matching control &amp; experimental groups, variables, control for bias, statistical significance, gold standard. There are regressive studies and prospective studies. There are clinical studies &amp; clinical trials.   


Opinion isn‚Äôt science. Somebody wearing a suit, talking confidently, making in-jokes about non-believers, giving slogans and memes shouldn‚Äôt automatically be believed because some people are really good at conning. Watch tv evangelists &amp; late night telemarketers. They sound convinced, don‚Äôt they? Don‚Äôt buy anything from them, ok?   
Those of us who studied science know what it is. The problem is those who didn‚Äôt study science who think they know what it is. I know a few things about cars. I know how airplanes fly, but I‚Äôm not an aeronautical engineer. I might be able to convince you I‚Äôm an aeronautical engineer, but it doesn‚Äôt mean I am one.

If most scientists say ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt believe this is true,‚Äù you should listen. If one scientist says s/he believes something is true and most scientists don‚Äôt believe it, tell that one scientist that you‚Äôll believe it when you see multiple scientists, using scientific method of research, get the same result &amp; come to the same conclusion s/he did.

Censorship can be conducted by governments, private institutions, and other controlling bodies.

The coronavirus disease 2019 has infected over 150 million people worldwide and led to over 3 million deaths. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 lineages B.1.1.7, B.1.617, B.1.351, and P.1 were reported to have higher infection rates than that of wild one. These mutations were noticed to happen in the receptor-binding domain of spike protein (S-RBD), especially mutations N501Y, E484Q, E484K, K417N, K417T, and L452R. Currently, there is still no specific medicine against the virus; moreover, cytokine storm is also a dangerous factor for severe infected patients. In this study, potential S-RBD-targeted active monomers from traditional Chinese medicine Ephedra sinica Stapf (ephedra) were discovered by virtual screening. NanoBiT assay was performed to confirm blocking activities of the screened compounds against the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We further analyzed the blocking effect of the active compounds on the interactions of mutated S-RBD and ACE2 by computational studies. Moreover, antiinflammatory activities were evaluated using qRT-PCR, enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay, and Western blot analysis. As a result, pseudoephedrine (MHJ-17) and its derivative (MHJ-11) were found as efficient inhibitors disrupting the interactions between ACE2 and both wild and mutated S-RBDs. In addition, they also have antiinflammatory activities, which can be potential drug candidates or lead compounds for further study.",,,,1632948911,{},herqij4,True,t3_py4h04,False,False,t3_py4h04,/r/Coronavirus/comments/py4h04/pseudoephedrine_and_its_derivatives_antagonize/herqij4/,1633089226.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

There's been tons and tons of studies on the effectiveness of the vaccines, even with seriously low estimates it still shows it makes you less likely to contract the virus compared to an unvaccinated person.

And i'll be the first to admit that in regards to ""big tech"" that some discussions absolutely need to be had, but we're far past the point of discussing ""are vaccines good for you?"". The answer is yes. The scientific community has spoken and we've had a general consensus about the validity and effectiveness of vaccines for decades. Yes, with anything medically related there are always risks involved, but anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers are being completely disingenuous about those risks. Millions and millions of people for decades have taken all sorts of vaccinations and lived side-effect free. Vaccines have been mandatory for things like public schools for **decades**.

Censoring this type of bullshit content isn't an indicator that we're living in this liberal dystopian future that a good amount of these anti-vaxxers seem to think we're living in. It's basically tantamount to removing those videos where idiots were dying from eating those detergent pods. We've 100% reached a point were we know that anti-vaccine beliefs are wrong. Enabling people to continue to put out factually misleading content about vaccines is basically like promoting that drinking bleach is good for you.

This type of censorship, whether you believe it or not, is 100% for the greater good. Anti-vaxxers are wrong. If you believe that vaccines are some sort of liberal conspiracy perpetrated by the deep state lizard people you should be in a mental institution. I ultimately feel bad for everyone who has fallen pray to bullshit conspiracy theories and are the victims of a poor public education system, but now the health and wellbeing of my family and myself are at risk and it's time to put an end to these dangerous beliefs.

This is not that dangerous relative to the other things we are allowing. The hospitals are full in a few states, such as Texas and Florida, but otherwise, they are at normal winter levels (hospitals are rarely empty, and admin is almost always pushing us to discharge patients because we're at 97-99% capacity for half the year). Kids, *especially* if vaccinated, are at low to minimal risk of hospitalization. And if you die because you're not vaccinated and you sent your kid to homecoming, that sounds like a personal problem. You're probably also doing other high risk things that can lead to your demise, such as attending concerts or sports games or large gatherings. Arbitrarily banning homecomings, when the kids during this pandemic have sacrificed the *most*, is cruel.



If we're not going to allow school dances, then I guess we also have to cancel all concerts, weddings, sporting events, conventions, and conferences.

So then we would include a complete waiver of all medical assistance in fighting that infection?

I mean, morally, I don't like that one bit, but if you want to give people the option to fight it on their own, then let's give them that option.

While we are at it, let's make them take full and complete liability for any and all infections that can be traced back to their infection.

&gt;That said, thinking the only way forward is to actually mandate that everyone gets a needle in the arm kind of **ignores science**

Ah, right.  When in doubt, claim the other person is ignoring science.  No, saying we want the best protection possible without forcing people to get infected is not ""ignoring science.""

Hospitals are struggling as it is.  We need to do everything we can to help them and having people intentionally infect themselves will make thr situation worse.

&gt;People with Natural Immunity, **who already** recovered, especially those in low risk categories, simply don't actually need the Vaccine.

If you only wanted to grand father in those that had established antibodies as of yesterday, that would be acceptable.  But any avenue that results in a reason for people to get infected is a non-starter because you'll put unnecessary pressure on hospitals.

So, Lydia, what should we do about it?  Do you have any suggestions or just more finger wagging?  Do you have any thoughts on a vaccine mandate that would end this pandemic?

Ethicists like Lydia always seem to be coming to the defense of the feelings of a dangerous minority over the needs of the population.

Likewise Healthcare workers on the frontlines are risking their health treating Covid patients. I would not mock them for catching the virus as a hazard of their job, even knowing the risk of being in a hospital worker right now. 

The people like in HCA are not being criticized (I don't see very much mockery honestly) because they took a risk. They are being criticized because they spread propaganda, downplaying the virus and didn't take reasonable measures to protect themselves or others. Oftentimes they were mocking people who got the vaccine or wore masks. They presumed they knew better than scientists and health care workers because they saw something on a blog. They weren't often taking a noble stand but rather being contrarian and at times, smug. And the subreddit showed that disbelief in the virus does not make it any less deadly.

I just wonder what other dumb, easy to disprove beliefs they hold. It's not my close family, we're meeting from time to time, and it's weird to have to avoid covid related subjects to stay ""respectful"", but it's just so ridiculous to me that in this age when they can easily get educated using google, they hold these beliefs. 

I think our education systems are to blame. We learn a lot of unnecessary stuff, a lot of FACTS, instead of learning how to do things. I don't mean they should teach kids ""COVID EXISTS"", I mean school should tell kids ""Hey, our brains, in their complexity, are sometimes really simple. One of the bigger issues with our minds is confirmation bias. Here's why, while helping you stay in your comfort zone, it's bad. Here's how you counter it"". 

People don't know how to search for information. They don't like finding information that makes them uncomfortable. Also all the ""smart algorithms"" help them in finding what they want to find instead of proper information. I remember when I talked to some anti-vaxxer before covid happened and I mentioned ""the first result in google when you search for \*something\*"". It turns out, in my case it was a research. In his case it was a personal blog of some anti vaxxer who didn't even sign his articles with his full name. Anyway, if someone believes vaccines are bad, they'll google for ""why vaccines are bad"" rather than ""why vaccines are good"". But then, even if they tried to fight their confirmation bias and google for ""vaccines myths"", I'm afraid they would find the anti-vaxxer kind of ""myths"" list. Personalization of search results in search engines should be illegal in my opinion. I don't understand how it's not a major part of discussion in subject of the spread of misinformation. In case of covid searches google used to show some WHO info (can't actually see it now when I search for ""why covid vaccines are bad""), maybe in this specific case they're fighting the misinformation (seems like they don't really do a good job), but overall search results are still personalized and the algorithm does a pretty bad job at understanding if it promotes misinformation or not.",,,,1632866118,{},henciip,False,t3_pxc6hb,False,False,t1_hemmtee,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pxc6hb/lebron_james_reveals_hes_vaccinated_i_was/henciip/,1633006747.0,30,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;The companies said that they would submit a formal request to regulators to allow a pediatric dose of their vaccine to be administered in the United States in the coming weeks. Similar requests will be filed with European regulators and in other countries.

&gt;The announcement, coming as U.S. schools have resumed amid a ferocious Delta wave, brings many parents another step closer to the likelihood of a Covid vaccine for their children.

&gt;Just over a week ago, Pfizer and BioNTech announced favorable results from their clinical trial with more than 2,200 participants in that age group. The F.D.A. has said that it will analyze the data as soon as possible.

&gt;The companies said last week that their vaccine had been shown to be safe and effective in low doses in children ages 5 to 11, offering hope to parents in the United States who are worried that a return to in-person schooling has put children at risk of infection.

&gt;About 28 million children ages 5 to 11 would be eligible for the vaccine in the United States, far more than the 17 million of ages 12 to 15 who became eligible for the vaccine in May.

&gt;But it is not clear how many in the younger cohort will be vaccinated. Inoculations among older children have lagged: Only about 42 percent of children ages 12 to 15 have been fully vaccinated in the United States, compared with 66 percent of adults, according to federal data.

&gt;Although many remain eager to inoculate their children, opinion polls suggest that some parents have reservations. A survey published last month by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 26 percent of parents of children ages 5 to 11 would vaccinate their children ‚Äúright away‚Äù once doses were authorized for their age group, 40 percent said they would ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù how the vaccine worked before doing so and 25 percent said they would not have their child vaccinated at all.

&gt;Studies have shown that unvaccinated children who contract the coronavirus tend not to get seriously ill, leading some parents to wonder whether the potential risks of a new vaccine outweigh the benefits.

&gt;And some parents who are themselves vaccinated have expressed concerns about the relatively small size of children‚Äôs trials and about a lack of data on the long-term safety of the shots.",,,,1632865709,{},henbkx3,True,t3_pxgs4y,False,False,t3_pxgs4y,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pxgs4y/covid_live_updates_pfizer_gives_fda_its_data_on/henbkx3/,1633006261.0,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Module 3 is the quality section including chemistry manufacturing and controls, Module 4 is nonclinical data (animal studies, toxicology etc) and module 5 is clinical data.

When clinical trials end they lock the database and send it to statisticians for analysis and they produce tables and figures based on the data. Then the summary sections are written by medical writers etc referencing the data.

They already have section 3 as this is probably an amended submission so they will probe my send information for any dose changes for filling. Section 4 wouldn‚Äôt change either.

""Well.. what can we do?""

My son asked.. Are we the states united as America. I said no.. we are the United States of America as a title, but thank you because you just said something that needed breaking down. The original freedom was based on individual states that represented different forms of FREEDOM uniting. 50 states leaves alot of room for variable. New York City alone has an abundence of diversity is an example is needed.

BUT NOW.. sadly. Diversity is being used as a weapon. An opportunity to not unite but divide, while TRULY diversity means growth as a collective nation. But fair to be fair we as a country need time to absorb. Control is out of control. There ia no sacet measures in place. There is now only the machine.

Meet your new public enemy. Solution without judgements over differences but instead over threats.

Both foreign and domestic. 

If I have to do it alone. Ill die spreading this message. Come together or become why we all fell apart. If it be only my own family. Let it be but let freedom ring please. Let life be life in its own capacity. It is time life became worth living again for all.. on all scales.

I mean, this is commonly parroted but not really true. I suppose it's likely more true for makeshift masks like cloth masks, bandanas, and gaiters, but a proper surgical mask, KN95, or N95 will protect the wearer just fine. I was forced to spend hours in rooms with COVID patients last year. The hospital ran out of N95s, so we had procedure masks only. These were patients that were *known* to have COVID, weren't wearing masks, and were sick enough to be hospitalized, so likely with pretty high viral load. Not a single employee got COVID from occupational exposure. Similar things were observed in Italy during the initial PPE shortage.


&gt;2. True. But that's why schools should require masks, social distancing, and offer online schooling for those who are at higher risk. If they don't want to cancel stuff, fine, but stop being stupid about everything and just take some precautions.


Online schooling is always an option. The requirements for homeschooling are minimal. Social distancing is a wishy washy measure.

The shots are no different than the first 2 you got.  Even if the evidence isnt 100% there that is going to do a whole lot, it's quite literally harmless besides some normal side effects  from getting a shot.

The more groups the booster is opened to, the more shots get boosters, the deeper we get into flu season, the more difficult it will be to get it when you want it.  Not trying to pressure you, but chances are you got this at a local pharmacy which as we go along is only going to get busier and busier- if you're going to get it in a month, you might as well do it now while its still a bit calm.  October and November are some of the busiest months with flu shots at full force.

Not to mention, while supply is good now, we ran out of JnJ months ago and we get a *million* calls every day asking if we have it in stock.  We are low on moderna, and we burn thru pfizer like crazy- the more mandates that happen the harder it will be.

Similarly, you can believe that nobody deserves to suffer while also believing that it would be better if certain people learned through suffering (rather than not learning at all).

All these things are compatible. They just don't neatly unify what people deserve (or don't). But that's just the thing: we can't all always get what we deserve. Life is messy.

I won't rule out anxiety as I'm an anxious person, but I noticed my HR was consistently 20 beats higher on runs than at any point in the past.  My 2nd shot was much easier in the heart realm, although this higher beat aspect persisted for a few months.  It was odd because I've actually tried to increase my high HR before and have never been able to.  It was always very difficult for me to break 163 or so.  A wider HR range can be helpful in training to indicate better performance.  After my shots, I could hit 170 on less than intense runs.  I also follow other professional athletes who post HR data and I found similar elevations in HR.  On longer, medium intensity runs, I would find my HR was 15-20 beats higher on average compared to identical runs in the past.  My resting HR however was never really affected at all.  I definitely don't want covid and think it was the right choice to get the vaccine, and I recognize that covid would have likely been worse, but it does create some hesitation when I consider another shot or future ones after that.

**Critical appraisal of omega-3 fatty acids in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder treatment**


Abstract

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder. The classical treatment of ADHD where stimulant medication is used has revealed severe side effects and intolerance. Consequently, the demand to search for alternative treatment has increased rapidly. When comparing levels of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (œâ-3 PUFAs) in ADHD patients with those in age-matching controls, lower levels are found in ADHD patients‚Äô blood. œâ-3 PUFAs are essential nutrients and necessary for a proper brain function and development. 

Additionally, there are strong indications that œâ-3 PUFA supplements could have beneficial effects on ADHD. However, the results of œâ-3 PUFA supplementation studies show a high variability. **Therefore, we reviewed recent studies published between 2000 and 2015** to identify effective treatment combinations, the quality of design, and safety and tolerability of œâ-3-containing food supplements. We searched the databases MEDLINE, PubMed, and Web of Science with keywords such as ‚ÄúADHD‚Äù and ‚Äúœâ-3/6 PUFA‚Äù and identified 25 studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results of these œâ-3 PUFA studies are contradictory but, overall, show evidence for a successful treatment of ADHD symptoms. Tolerability of the given supplements was high, and only mild side effects were reported. **In conclusion, there is evidence that a œâ-3 PUFA treatment has a positive effect on ADHD**. It should be added that treatment could be more effective in patients with mild forms of ADHD. Moreover, the dosage of stimulant medication could be reduced when used in combination with œâ-3 PUFA supplements. Further studies are necessary to investigate underlying mechanisms that can lead to a reduction of ADHD symptoms due to œâ-3 PUFA treatments and also to determine the optimal concentrations of œâ-3 PUFAs, whether used as single treatment or in combination with other medication.",,,,1632927722,{},heqa91n,False,t3_pxv04x,False,False,t1_hepwvh7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pxv04x/youtube_is_banning_prominent_antivaccine/heqa91n/,1633063488.0,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,
