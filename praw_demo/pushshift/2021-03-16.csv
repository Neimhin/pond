 The AstraZeneca case continues to be discussed.  After the suspension of the vaccine by AIFA, the verdict of the EMA is expected, set for next Thursday in order to resume, in the event of a positive verdict, the administration of the doses.  From many quarters, Astrazeneca and especially Ema in the lead, reassurances have arrived on the possible correlations between suspected deaths from thrombosis and the administration of the vaccine.  But the words spoken this evening at Porta a Porta by Professor Pal√π, president of Aifa, make us reflect.  Pal√π did not mince words and stated: ""The risk-benefit ratio is clearly in favor of the benefits. Obviously we must wait for the evaluation of the EMA, which will probably give a warning note because if female subjects with coagulation problems have  having had this thrombosis, it will probably be necessary to study and ask for more attention to these subjects "".  And again: ""The vaccine has caused thrombosis in some women, perhaps who have coagulation defects, women who take the pill. It is better for these people not to do it? It could be so but let's wait"".  In short, according to what was declared by Pal√π, most likely on Thursday the EMA could correct the shot on the vaccine.

What slave labor? Keep eating up western propaganda. China currently has a lower percentage of people in poverty than the US, contrast that to a life expectancy of 35 years less than 70 years ago. According to Marx can capitalism do that? The answer is no.

They did have to go through rough times because they were basically a feudal society and according to Marx and Lenin there's no better vehicle to industrialize than capitalism, China is still to this day largely rural, so they had to adopt some of those measures.

* MHRA have missed the very serious illnesses and deaths of a few dozen younger British women following the vaccine 
* duff batch poisoning continental Europeans
* some brand of medication not used in the U.K. causes a serious interaction with the vaccine (the contraceptive pill?)
* Genetic effect (don‚Äôt think likely - cases also seen in Norway and lots of Scandinavian genes in the British Isles due to the Viking era)
* Seasonal effect - is the diagnosis naturally more common around this time of year, so naively using annual rates makes it look worse than it is
* misunderstood diagnosis - it‚Äôs just more common than we previously thought

&gt; Regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine, the findings revealed that a single vaccine dose is approximately 60 ‚Äì 75% effective in reducing symptomatic infection. With the Pfizer vaccine, an effectiveness of 70% was observed after 28 days of first dose administration and an effectiveness of 90% was observed after 14 days of second dose administration. With the AstraZeneca vaccine, effectiveness of 60% was observed after 28 days of vaccination, which further increased to 75% after 35 days of vaccination.  

In the real world rollout Pfizer is ~roughly as effective as AZ.

The most likely to die, aka your grandma and my grandparents, should have been a priority.  People who have to go into work should have had priority.  These are the people who end up in hospitals and the people who end up spreading the virus.  Not people working from home.  

Instead of doing an online sign-up, businesses should have been offered slots to their employees.  Vaccination sites specifically for those 55 and older.  Whatever is left over each day, put the WFH people on standby lists.  That way, the right people get vaccinated, and the people with the flexible schedules can drop everything and go running at a moment's notice.

I feel you on the shouting into the void.  So many people don't realize how absolutely fortunate they are to be in the position they are in and are really tone deaf to the people who have supposedly been ""keeping the economy going"".

I get we all want to get back to our lives, but it really diminishes the sacrifice people like me had to make for the last year, not being able to even WORK safely, while people bitch about not being able to go to the fucking beach.  And now these are the people getting vaccinated when I still have to work in unsafe conditions.  It makes me crazy.  Like can't sleep at night angry.  I've been taking on a huge risk for not just my literal life, but the life of my loved ones.  The least society could do is pay me back with a vaccination date before all the people who have been hiding in their homes.  Most places aren't having people back before the fall.  Meanwhile, I am still at work, vaccine or not.  But hey, put me further to the back of the line.  I guess people deserve their beach time more than I do my health.

Finally, they call my number, give us less than two weeks before dumping the rest of the population onto this mess.  I feel like I'm NEVER going to get vaccinated, and I'm going to have to watch all these people go back to their normal life while I get left behind AGAIN.  So much for my sacrifice.  I have never felt so meaningless in my life.  That an entire society believes I am expendable.  

And now a new problem.  I've been shit on by this society for a year, and now everyone can use me as a punching bag because it's ""so easy to get a vaccine if you can do all these things only WFH people have the privilege to do"".  Try being a shift worker.  Try having only a thirty minute lunch each day of a 45 hour work week.  Try getting a vaccine when you know you can get fired for having your phone out while on duty.  Then, tell me how easy it is.

People need to understand that they are privileged and not make people who already feel like horseshit feel even worse.  It's the least people can do.

The disease was likely passed to him by the staff or a visitor who, like many people I know, wasn't being careful.  Suddenly, I did know someone who died of covid.  You don't want this to be you.

Also, the covid IFR is around 0.5% and around 1/3 of the population has been infected.  So that is 1 in 600 that have died.  That is about the average size of a (large) social circle, so it absolutely makes sense that some people, like you, don't know anyone who has died.  But 0.5% is a HUGE number of people, is a much higher fatality rate than the flu, and would be a much higher number if our hospitals were overrun.",,,1615945528,{},gr6xbiz,False,t3_m6kz0l,False,True,t1_gr6s0c3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m6kz0l/brazils_deaths_from_covid_break_record_with_2842/gr6xbiz/,1615949173,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

‚ÄúThe idea that all of the vaccines are pretty much the same, in that they‚Äôre perfect at preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations and death, got its legs on social media. The USA Today op-ed by the former members of the Biden team illustrated this by linking to a data table found on Twitter. Created by the infectious-disease doctor Monica Gandhi, it showed a variety of trial results for six different vaccines. One column was rendered in canary yellow‚Äî‚ÄúProtection from hospitalizations/death‚Äù‚Äîand every cell read ‚Äú100%.‚Äù A similar table, tweeted out a few days earlier by the dean of Brown University‚Äôs School of Public Health, Ashish Jha, conveyed the same idea through a grid of zeros‚Äîas in, zero people hospitalized, zero people dead. The prominent physician and researcher Eric Topol followed with his own clinical-trial data summary featuring a column of 100 percents. ‚ÄúThat is impressive!‚Äù he wrote across the top. All told, their posts would be retweeted about 15,000 times.

The data were indeed suggestive of an encouraging idea. Based on the numbers so far, we can expect the vaccines to provide extremely high levels of protection against the most dire outcomes. Still, we don‚Äôt know how high‚Äîand it‚Äôs clear they won‚Äôt uniformly cause hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 to disappear in vaccinated people.

 
The experts understand this, of course. Gandhi has been updating her table as more data come in, and now pegs Moderna‚Äôs efficacy on that front at 97 percent; Jha has since tweeted that ‚Äúnothing is 100 percent ‚Ä¶ But these vaccines sure are close‚Äù; and Topol told The Atlantic that the numbers in his tweet are not a sufficient basis from which to draw ‚Äúany determination of magnitude of effect,‚Äù though the fact that they all point in the same direction is ‚Äúvery encouraging.‚Äù Still, the message of perfection that their initial tables and tweets spawned‚Äîthe gist, for many readers, of all those 100s and zeros‚Äîhas since been picked up far and wide, and misinterpreted along the way.
To grasp the shaky nature of these particular data, it‚Äôs important to remember how the vaccine-development process began. Last April, not long after the pandemic began, the World Health Organization set out a target efficacy for vaccines of 50 percent, with options for how that value should be measured. A vaccine could be shown to reduce the risk of symptomatic disease, severe disease, or transmission of the coronavirus. The FDA offered similar guidance in June, and other regulatory agencies also followed the WHO‚Äôs lead. Among these choices, symptomatic disease was the most feasible, because it‚Äôs both a common outcome and one that‚Äôs easier to confirm in a large-scale trial. An outcome that included asymptomatic infections would have been even more common, but screening for all infections would have been prohibitive, especially early in the pandemic. So that‚Äôs how the vaccine trials were designed: Each would try to demonstrate at least 50 percent efficacy with respect to symptomatic disease as its ‚Äúprimary outcome.‚Äù

 
The trials could have used severe disease, hospitalization, or death as primary outcomes, but that would have slowed things down. These events are far more infrequent‚Äîthere could have been 200 infections for each COVID-19 death in the U.S.‚Äîand that means it would have taken more time, and larger numbers of trial participants, to generate enough data to be sure of a 50 percent efficacy. Developers did include ‚Äúsevere COVID-19‚Äù as a secondary outcome‚Äîthat is, one that would be measured and analyzed, but for which the trial might not have been designed to provide a definitive answer. Efficacy against hospitalization and against death, however, were not included as secondary outcomes for every trial.

Given that fact, the data can‚Äôt support a claim that the vaccines are 100 percent effective at preventing these serious outcomes. (Topol highlighted this very issue in an op-ed last fall for The New York Times.) Out of the six vaccines included in the dramatic data tables that made the rounds on Twitter, the clinical trials for only two of them‚ÄîOxford-AstraZeneca‚Äôs and Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs‚Äîincluded hospitalization for COVID-19 as a secondary outcome, and reported that efficacy rate. The clinical research for one other vaccine, made by Novavax, had hospitalization as a secondary outcome, but that trial hasn‚Äôt been reported in full yet.

Moderna: 94% effective at preventing any symptomatic case of COVID

&gt; Cases of COVID‚Äë19, starting 14 days after Dose 2, were defined as symptomatic COVID‚Äë19 requiring positive RT-PCR result and at least two systemic symptoms or one respiratory‚ÄØsymptom.

Johnson and Johnson: 66% effective at preventing moderate to severe COVID (72% in USA)

&gt; Moderate COVID-19 was defined as laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 plus either one of the following: evidence of pneumonia; deep vein thrombosis; difficulty breathing; abnormal oxygen saturation or a respiratory rate equal to or greater than 20; or two or more signs or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, such as cough, sore throat, fever or chills. Severe COVID-19 was defined as laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 plus evidence of clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness, respiratory failure, shock, significant organ dysfunction, hospital intensive care unit admission or death.

AstraZeneca: 62.1% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID

&gt; The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against NAAT-confirmed COVID-19. The primary outcome was virologically confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19, defined as a NAAT-positive swab combined with at least one qualifying symptom (fever ‚â•37¬∑8¬∞C, cough, shortness of breath, or anosmia or ageusia).",,,1615961366,{},gr7lvh2,False,t3_m6ii4p,False,True,t1_gr7i93z,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m6ii4p/the_damage_is_done_europes_caution_over/gr7lvh2/,1615961377,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It's been shown that humoral immunity is short lived and that the antibody repertoire is largely antibodies that have undergone limited somatic hypermutation.  That indicates a lack of selection against self autoreactivity largely due to the lack of GC formation.  Mild patients have a better GC response but it's still not on the level that we see with other respiratory viruses.  Even in mild cases, there's a thoracic LN GC low population of individuals.  Formation and re-entry into GCs following immunization without the associated inflammatory response (which is still there in mild disease but not overt) would eliminated autoreactive B cells.  

&gt;Unless the idea is that some of the less directed anti-spike antibodies are anti-self, which, fair enough, they could be. 

It's not just anti-S that are involved here.  Anti-self can be anything that's extrafollicular.  But, reformation of GCs can induce cells to re-enter, even when not targeted specifically by the antigen in question.  The GCs formed after vaccination aren't ectopic GCs like those found in AI disorders.  That being said, there are patients that do have anti-ACE2 IgM which I believe may be a result of aberrant recognition of an ACE2-S complex.    

&gt;This isn't completely unreasonable for people who have a cytokine storm as part of their disease course I guess. 

You don't need anti-self antibodies to induce macrophage activation syndrome in SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Delayed type I interferon is basically all you need to get the ball rolling.  Essentially, within the first 3 days of infection, if you don't have type I IFN being produced by the alveolar epithelial cells, you're going to run into issues as you'll have monocyte derived macrophage infiltration into the lungs.  Once that occurs, it's pretty much guaranteed that you're going to have a hyperinflammatory response as these macrophages are polarized to M1 (versus that tissue resident macrophages in the lungs which are polarized to M2).  What patients with mild disease or even asymptomatic disease can have is lung inflammation but they don't even realize it.  It's not uncommon to see ground glass opacity in the lungs of even asymptomatic individuals.  What the asymptomatic individuals don't seem to have is endothelial vascular cell dysfunction for some reason that we just don't know yet.

&gt;It's not a good explanation for people with long-covid after cases which don't have this occur, which is a vast majority of cases.  In the normal (read: sub-ICU) course of infection, people seem to undergo a standard pattern of memory B-cell evolution.

Most asymptomatic/mild cases also don't develop long COVID.  As I said, there's a small percent of individuals with low GC formation even in mild disease.  There's also around 7% of patients that just flat out don't seroconvert with detectable anti-S antibodies.  It would be interesting to see the outcomes from these populations of patients and whether they contribute to long COVID or if it's something like errant anti-aPL autoantibodies.",,,1615961276,{},gr7lrpd,False,t3_m6a417,False,True,t1_gr7aq07,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m6a417/vaccination_may_ease_long_covid_symptoms_early/gr7lrpd/,1615961287,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

As much as governments have tried to cause both the physical and mental health of society to deteriorate, I care about intrinsic health and have a very capable immune system that doesn‚Äôt rely on a multitude of external factors to fight something such as this virus. 

Herd immunity has been demonstrated in most places to be extremely significant at this point - I don‚Äôt have the links because I have too many things saved to sift through but you can find it if you look. T cell immunity is also another thing that provides protection but of course, it is not widely discussed.

Otherwise, it isn‚Äôt an obligation. Seeing as my life and many others have been turned upside-down by this overblown situation, I simply don‚Äôt have the energy to be guilted into caring about people who quite clearly do not care about me. 

The healthcare system being overwhelming due to covid just simply was never going to happen, and after a year it should be obvious that it will not happen. If it would have happened, that would have been due to the failures of structure, funding and management, not covid, at least in my country.

Pandemic. it doesn go away just because it shows us how fucked up most of our inefficient and harmfull systems are.


Online teaching is not inherently bad, online teaching in the system we have now is just making it even worse.
Just changing it back to in person school does not get rid of the underlying problem.

Welcome to the world of brexiters.

In the UK we have had to live with 40 years of weaponising lies to smear the EU at every chance they got. They are ideologically driven and have no issue ignoring facts and reality.

There is a simple way to look at all this. Certain medical regulators in some countries found some irregularities and **did their job** by recommending a short pause while they investigate. Politicians saw this as a really prickly issue so they talked and decided they didn't want to overly spook the public so they should try to convey a joined up message and strategy.

But this is an ideal opportunity for brexiters. Instead of going with the simple and correct explanation, they can seize that, twist it to say that politicians across the EU (and outside the EU but lets ignore that) coordinated to force medical regulators to suspend the AZ vaccine because they were sour that Britain left the EU and is ""winning"" the vaccine race.

Honestly, we're living in an awful timeline.

There is absolutely no truth in these accusations. Norway isn't part of the EU and its not politicians that have  suspended AZ, its their medical health agency which has nothing to do with politicans, due to weird statistically significant serius conditions arising after vaccination. Why would Norway try to score political points when they are not part of the EU? Sweden has suspended AZ vaccination, and it is not a political decision. Its a decision by the Swedish health agency that is completely free from any political interference. Astra Zeneca is 50% swedish and the biggest drug producer in Sweden. Why would Sweden sabotage their own company over political points? Same thing with Denmark and Germany, the german health agency Paul Erhlich Institute have paused the AZ vaccine, not politicans. The danish health agency have paused the vaccine, not politicans. Politicians can not pause vaccines in these countries since they don't have that  type of judicial power. The health agencies of european countries have judicial power to pause anything health care related, whether it's drugs or vaccines. People on this sub are acting like pausing vaccines/drugs is something new when in fact, medications are paused yearly by EMA and health care agencies in different countries.

Germany, Norway, Denmark, Austria and other countries have paused vaccinations due to several cases of DIC, a serious condition that causes bleeding, clotting and low blood palatels and has a mortality of 20-50%. It is notoriously difficulty to treat. Norway has started vaccinating their health care workers recently and they already got 6 cases of DIC in female health care workers between 20 and 40 years old, 3 have died. It is so weird that the norwegian chief physician on the hematology department says [he has never seen anything like it before](https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/i/wenlan/behandlende-lege-om-blodpropp-funn-ikke-sett-noe-i-denne-gaten-foer) Austria has reported 3 cases of DIC, two nurses from the same hospital, one has died. Germany has reported 7 cases of DIC, 6 of them young women and three deaths in that group. The only commonality between these cases have been that they have been vaccinated with AZ 3-14 days after severe symptoms.

The Paul Erhlich Institute calls it ""statistically significant and striking""

&gt;Following intensive consultations on the serious thrombotic events that have occurred in Germany and Europe, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut recommends the temporary suspension of vaccinations with the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca.  
&gt;  
&gt;Compared to the status on 11 March 2021, additional cases (as of Monday, 15 March 2021) have now been reported in Germany. Analysing the new data status, the experts of the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut now see a striking accumulation of a special form of very rare cerebral vein thrombosis (sinus vein thrombosis) in connection with a deficiency of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) and bleeding in temporal proximity to vaccinations with the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca.

A pause for some days to investigate these cases is not the end of the world, especially when its about young previously healthy people, and I bet the same people complaining over the pause would have called these countries murderers if they didn't investigate the cases and it turned out to be something wrong with the vaccine.

Brazil‚Äôs rolling coronavirus disaster is a threat to the world
Ishaan Tharoor
In the tortuous course of the coronavirus pandemic, there has been at least one constant: Latin America‚Äôs most populous nation has not handled it well. Brazil lags behind only the United States in coronavirus-related deaths and infections. But the latter is starting to battle its way out of the pandemic; in Brazil, the outbreak is now worse than it has ever been.

The country on Tuesday reported close to 3,000 deaths, a spike that accelerated this month. In the past week, Brazil posted a record of 12,888 new deaths and more than 467,944 new cases, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Experts warn that Brazil‚Äôs hospital system is on the brink of collapse, with occupancy peaking near or even pushing past capacity in over half the states of the country. Rather than going up, the daily numbers of administered coronavirus tests ‚Äî key to tracking and stopping a surge in cases ‚Äî have declined dramatically since December.

Part of the problem is the emergence of a more virulent coronavirus variant in Brazil, one whose rapid spread since January has raised global alarm. ‚ÄúIf Brazil is not serious, then it will continue to affect all of the neighborhood there ‚Äî and beyond,‚Äù Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, warned earlier this month. ‚ÄúThis is not just about Brazil. It‚Äôs about the whole Latin America, and even beyond.‚Äù

Even in communities that are developing greater levels of immunity, an uncontrolled outbreak can still give rise to dangerous variants ‚Äî and scientists fret that Brazil is incubating possibly deadlier new strains. A patchwork of inconsistent curfews and lockdowns in states and cities failed to stave off the crisis many Brazilian medical workers feared would come. Doctors and health officials are now battling against a rising tide.

‚ÄúPatients are being transferred from state to state ‚Äî sometimes traveling hundreds of miles ‚Äî in a nationwide hunt for hospital resources,‚Äù my colleague Terrence McCoy wrote last week. ‚ÄúWithout ventilators, nurses have pumped infected patients‚Äô lungs manually. Cemeteries are running out of space to put the bodies. Refrigerated containers wait outside hospitals to take the overflow. People all over the country are dying at home, unable to get treatment.‚Äù

It‚Äôs impossible to overlook the role played by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. The far-right firebrand bumbled through the pandemic ‚Äî famously deeming the coronavirus little more than a ‚Äúmeasly flu‚Äù a year ago and, more recently in December, declaring that the outbreak had reached its ‚Äútail end.‚Äù He contracted the virus himself but continued to tout unproven remedies and raged against social distancing measures and other precautions advocated by regional officials and his political adversaries. Under Bolsonaro‚Äôs watch, Brazil ‚Äúsuccumbed to denialism, disorganization, apathy, hedonism and medical quackery,‚Äù wrote McCoy.

In an illustration of the chaos, Bolsonaro announced this week that he would be appointing a new health minister ‚Äî the country‚Äôs fourth since the pandemic began. The first two fell afoul of the president after questioning his leadership and covid-era decision-making. The third, an active-duty general with no medical training, is now being investigated by the country‚Äôs top court for alleged neglect that led to the collapse of the health system in Amazonas state earlier this year.

During a briefing Tuesday, Marcelo Queiroga, a cardiologist who will transition into the role of health minister in the coming days, reiterated his loyalty to Bolsonaro. ‚ÄúThe president is very worried about the situation,‚Äù he said.

Critics wonder if that‚Äôs true. Brazil‚Äôs lack of effective national coordination on the pandemic is, in part, Bolsonaro‚Äôs fault. He and his allies initially pushed misinformation downplaying the threat of the virus and the efficacy of social distancing and masks. Later, Bolsonaro questioned the value of vaccines, stoking anti-Beijing sentiment even as a Chinese vaccine was undergoing trials in Brazil. Last October, he blocked federal government plans to purchase tens of millions of doses of the Sinovac vaccine.

On this front, Bolsonaro had a fellow traveler in former president Donald Trump, who similarly scorned covid-era lockdowns and sought to blame his domestic rivals, as well as China, for the woes of the pandemic. Last year, the Trump administration also pressured Brazil to not obtain the Russian Sputnik V vaccine for its population.

But with Trump gone and infections spiking, Bolsonaro is in the midst of a humiliating about-face. His government announced last week that it had ordered 10 million doses of the Russian vaccine. And it had to go to China, cap in hand, to request tens of millions of doses of a Chinese vaccine, as well as the raw materials to mass produce it on Brazilian soil.

‚ÄúChina spent months batting away resentment and distrust as the place where the pandemic began, but in recent weeks its diplomats, pharmaceutical executives and other power brokers have been fielding scores of requests for vaccines from desperate officials in Latin America, where the pandemic is taking a devastating toll that grows by the day,‚Äù noted the New York Times. ‚ÄúBeijing‚Äôs ability to mass-produce vaccines and ship them to countries in the developing world ‚Äî while rich countries, including the United States, are hoarding many millions of doses for themselves ‚Äî has offered a diplomatic and public relations opening that China has readily seized.‚Äù

Meanwhile, in Brazil‚Äôs turbulent domestic political scene, Bolsonaro‚Äôs mismanagement has presented a new opening for his main rival. Former leftist president Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva scorned Bolsonaro‚Äôs ‚Äúmoronic‚Äù handling of the crisis. ‚ÄúThis country is in a state of utter tumult and confusion because there‚Äôs no government,‚Äù Lula declared last week, lamenting the lives that could have saved and warning that ‚Äúcovid is taking over the country.‚Äù

Brazil‚Äôs medical workers are desperately trying to prevent that from happening. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to help people but this disease is much faster and more aggressive than the tactics we‚Äôve been using,‚Äù Andr√© Machado, an infectious-disease specialist in the city of Porto Alegre, told the Guardian. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like we‚Äôre flogging a dead horse.

I think ultimately that Merkel is to blame.  For buying into the bullshit about the EU falling apart if they didn't buy this medicine together.  

""

Things got so bad that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron had a call the first working week of January to patch things up. The Elys√©e official said that by the end of the call, Macron was convinced that Germany wouldn‚Äôt try to actually fulfill its side deals.""

&amp;#x200B;

The deal with the EMA should have fallen apart when Poland balked at buying enough of the vaccine from Biontech/Pfizer or Moderna.  

""

Germany, however, wanted to throw more money at the problem. Specifically, it wanted to bet even bigger on its homegrown mRNA vaccines ‚Äî especially given that BioNTech was well into Phase 3 trials. In mid-September, Berlin announced it was giving ‚Ç¨375 million to BioNTech and ‚Ç¨252 million to CureVac.

Why invest in expensive, unproven technologies that need to be transported at super low temperatures? ...  
Poland spoke out against having mRNA vaccines represent half the stock.

""

&amp;#x200B;

Didn't seem to matter to countries like Poland that the results of the tests were very promising or that many of the EU countries could actually distribute the cold vaccines... they had to cater to the lowest common denominator.  Which in this case, was a disaster waiting to happen, considering that mRNA vaccines have been pretty much the saviour here.  

&amp;#x200B;

So the contracts were signed too late , for too little vaccine, and with seemingly very little forethought about how they, the manufacturers, would make enough of the stuff in time.

Because the supply rate is increasing.  If you are vaccinating the same rate today as you did yesterday you are failing.  Full stop. 

It made sense to vaccinate the elderly first - overwhelmingly it was a population that could benefit MASSIVELY from focused protection.  But after that it is diminishing returns.  

Right after the elderly, what we should be shooting for is herd immunity.  If we get there faster and end this sooner, Covid will have less chance to mutate.  This is not just minority good for society, it is HUGE. It outweighs every other criteria (after protecting the elderly). So at this point the ONLY thing that matters is if you have vaccination schedule openings.  If the schedule is not 100% full, you just screwed up big time, you slowed down the race to the biggest goal, you should have errored on the side of opening up more categories.  The goal is to reach the most total number of people, which slows the spread.

Somehow we got into a mentality that the order matters matters more than getting to herd immunity.  It doesn‚Äôt.  Every person that gets the vaccine 1 day sooner slows the infection rate to everybody that has not been infected.  

Everybody needs to stop worrying about the order, it is a distraction.  

The time is rushing up on us quickly when some percentage of the population are either anti-vaccination, or too lazy to get in line and keep that vaccination schedule full.  Nobody is totally sure at what exact percentage we reach herd immunity, but one recent article said when 70% are vaccinated, so let‚Äôs use that as an example.  If we get to 60% and the lines dwindle and they are sitting on more and more unused vaccine, we ALL LOSE.  If we can get across that finish line to 71% or even 75% or a slam dunk bury this thing 80% we all win big.

Pfizer paid 100% of the costs for the development of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

Back in April 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced their partnership for which Pfizer paid 100% of the development costs. Agreement with Germany only comes in September 2021, by which time they already had a successful candidate and were conducting late stage trials. No German money was spent on the actual development of this vaccine, that was all Pfizer money.

Any German money that BioNTech may have received for this vaccine went to ""market authorization"" (applying for a license) and for manufacturing facilities (which came online only back in February 2021). Source 1 (April 2020):

    ‚ÄúWe have already started working with Pfizer on our COVID-19 vaccine and are pleased to announce these further details of our ongoing collaboration, which reflects both companies‚Äô strong commitment to move quickly to bring a safe and efficacious vaccine to patients worldwide,‚Äù says Co-Founder and CEO of BioNTech, Ugur Sahin, M.D.

    Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will pay BioNTech $185 million in upfront payments, including a cash payment of $72 million and an equity investment of $113 million. BioNTech is eligible to receive future milestone payments of up to $563 million for a potential total consideration of $748 million. Pfizer and BioNTech will share development costs equally. Initially, Pfizer will fund 100 percent of the development costs, and BioNTech will repay Pfizer its 50 percent share of these costs during the commercialization of the vaccine.

Source 2: September 2020

    the funding is an important contribution to accelerate the development and scaling-up of our COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing capacities in Germany. It highlights the tremendous importance of our mission to efficiently find a lasting solution to control the pandemic,‚Äù said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech.

So German money was used for a factory in Marburg and not for developing a vaccine.

A better and more fair approach would have been to put people in groups based upon their birthday and randomly select the group to receive the vaccine over the next 1-2 weeks (based on supply) via lottery, i.e. the Contagion method. You get random (well not completely, but close) subsets of the populations vaccinated at once, which allows things to start reopening safely. 

Plus you have to take into account groups of younger people who now have lifelong health complications due to catching the virus.

Of course not.

I definitely see where you're coming from about being pissed about your friends getting vaccines while you're getting hung out to dry. It's like a worse form of finals week during college; day 1 everyone is in the same boat and praying for it to be over, but by day 7 most people have gotten their tests done and gone home. Me and you are on day 4 when it's a mix of people just finishing up and unlucky ones that haven't even started yet.

And to your point about people saying you're being difficult, that must be so aggravating. People who aren't understanding of circumstances that they've never experienced, like difficulty getting the vaccine, can sometimes be so callous :( It's **hard** to find a vaccine! Even when someone dedicates their day to finding appointments, odds are they end up not finding anything. And that's not even getting into cases like yours where you can't spend every waking minute looking.

There had to have been a better way to roll out vaccines.

Otherwise we would have seen that explosive spread way sooner than we did. As a lab professional in Canada we were definitely testing anyone with suspicious symptoms in February and had very low/no positives until March.

As an aside, a few years ago I thought I had a cold that would just not go away. Just had a sore throat and a bit of sniffles, eventually developed a cough. Never had a fever, so I was convinced it wasn't the flu or something bacterial. Convinced it was something viral I didnt bother going to an urgent care clinic knowing they'd just say it was something viral and send me home. It took me having this cold on and off for two weeks before I finally went to see a Doctor, who wouldn't believe I wasn't a smoker when he checked me with a stethoscope. Turns out it was strep, still have no idea how I never had a fever or much more of a sore throat. Moral of the story is infections can be weird and you can have one thing that presents completely atypically.

Stating all the vaccines are equivalent is another ‚Äúwhite lie‚Äù similar to telling people not to wear masks;  it comes from a good place, because every person even partially vaccinated helps the overall population, but it is absolutely not equivalent at the individual level.

Unfortunately, people can see through the way these have been presented to the public in many countries, and it‚Äôs unnecessarily been creating vaccine hesitancy.  The far better approach is to promote the positive aspects of each vaccine and trust people to make the right choices.

In the US, the lower-efficacy J+J vaccine is very popular among people who are afraid of needles or with busy schedules - the single dose regimen is creating quite a bit of demand, freeing up mRNA vaccines for those who want them.  

A similar argument should be made for AZ - it‚Äôs lower efficacy but available immediately, and is perfect for lower risk individuals who want protection sooner.  Under those conditions, many people will naturally choose it - no inaccurate propaganda required.",,,1615944914,{},gr6w5vj,False,t3_m6ii4p,False,True,t1_gr6vdf0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m6ii4p/the_damage_is_done_europes_caution_over/gr6w5vj/,1615948603,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

FAQ: What does this mean? 

The amount of karma (points) on your thread and Reddit account has decreased by one. 

Why did you do this? 

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to: Rudeness towards other Redditors, Spreading incorrect information, Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s. Trump. 

Am I banned from the Reddit? 

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy. 

I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it? 

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception. 

How can I prevent this from happening in the future? 

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct.

&gt;Autoimmune antibodies. So there's no virus left but there's a broad immune response caused by the infection which has been left.

This is my working theory and I think it fits the disease quite nicely, actually.  Not so much narrowing of the response.  But, elimination of extrafollicular B cells that often produce autoreactive antibodies.  Early Ab response and lack of germinal centers are seen in SARS-CoV-2 infection which leads to extrafollicular B cells that haven't undergone selection (and that antibody repertoire is similar to that seen in SLE which shares a lot in common with the symptoms of long COVID).

The most important point. I would argue that this data doesn't qualify as fatality rate for that reason. It's a little irresponsible to be calling it that imo. 

&gt;Equally, the high CFR may mean that it won't transmit easily because people get sick and become less mobile (see SARS1).

There is a hardly a silver lining in SARS-CoV-2 becoming more lethal. Incubation period is what matters in what you're describing. We know that people don't get symptoms right away, so they are capable of infecting others for a while before they figure out that they're infected themselves. Also, the virus is airborne, so it's transmitted much more easily.

[],,vitt72,,,[],,,,text,t2_cyw94,False,False,[],"Very unlikely. For reassurance, I like to apply some basic statistics to things. For instance, in order for you to have gotten covid from this situation a number of assumptions have to be made which have various probabilities.    
**Assumption 1: That person had covid.**    
Per worldometers, there's about 7 million active cases of corona currently in the US (assuming you're from the US). Now there's probably more bc I believe this is based on those who have tested, but this number is also probably smaller because you are not highly contagious the entire time you are an ""active case"" and a large percent of these people are probably staying home. So lets still just call it 7 million. 7M/330M us population ~ 2% chance this man has corona. 

**Assumption 2: There was enough viral load in one breath to infect you**    
This one is harder to quantify because there have not been direct studies to measure this, but most research says you need sustained contact with an infected person to also become infected. Most corona spread has been indoors, and drops off drastically outdoors. In fact, the CDC only considers ""close contact with an infected"" if you spent more than 15 minutes with them over a 24hr period. You spent around 1 second in their breath stream. For sake of this example I'll quantify it and say 5%, a number which is probably *vastly* too high.     
    
**Assumption 3: Enough viral load got through your N95 mask to infect you.**    
Another harder to quantify assumption, but considering you were wearing an N95 mask which is the gold standard for mask effectiveness, this number is again probably ridiculously low. From just things that I have seen however, I will again make an educated guess here and say the chances that enough infected particles make it through your N95 mask at maybe 5%.

A quick multiplication of (0.02)(0.05)(0.05) brings us to **0.005%** chance that you got infected.

a couple other options that matter for florida (but not sure how much) is that tourist cases count in their home areas not in florida and many locals intentionally avoid tourist areas, so they become somewhat isolated from whatever the tourists brought in. the same could be true of florida seniors versus other state seniors since florida has so many intentional retirement communities (the villages, among others) that are more self contained cities that people don't have to leave in order to get medical care, food, etc etc.

Of course it is, because it's not banned because they've found blood clots. They've suspended it because they've discovered an increase in this very specific type of blood clot in addition to other symptoms that link these cases. 




&gt; 28 of these events out of 26 million doses.

In Germany, they found 7 cases in 1.6 million people vaccinated, when they would expect 1 case normally. In Norway it's a lot higher: 4 in 120 thousand. That points towards there being an issue. The additional symptom of low platelets makes it even more suspicious. It's also been found mostly in people who are healthy and relatively young.


Many types of blood clots are common. Pretending that these cases should be thrown into the same statistic is dishonest. 



 &gt; Surely companies making billions out of this vaccine would have no reason to want to discredit a not for profit vaccine but maybe that's just me not paying attention



So the conspiracy theory now is that Pfizer poisoned people, then bribed health authorities and experts in Norway, Denmark, Germany, France, Spain, etc. ? 


sounds very likely. 


&gt; Suspending this vaccine has done more harm than good


Countries like Norway don't have much of the vaccine anyways, and it can be stored for a few weeks until we clarify the situation.

&gt;In seven cases (as of 15.03.2021), **a special form of severe cerebral venous thrombosis associated with a lack of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) and bleeding** has been diagnosed in connection with vaccination with the AstraZeneca COVID 19 vaccine \[...\]  
The number of these cases after the AstraZeneca COVID 19 vaccination is **statistically significantly higher than the number of cerebral venous thromboses that normally occur in the non-vaccine population**. For this purpose, an observed-versus-expected analysis was performed, in which the number of cases expected without vaccination in a time window of 14  days was compared with the number of cases reported after about 1.6  Million AstraZeneca vaccinations in Germany. **About one case would have been expected, seven cases had been reported. \[...\]**  
All experts were unanimous in their opinion that a pattern could be identified here and that a connection with the AstraZeneca vaccination was not implausible. 

So what we have in Germany is a cluster of very rare side effects well over the expected number of cases in the general population. They also affect a low-risk Covid group (20-50 years old, mostly in the lower range of that. For context, we've had less than 30 fatalities in the 20-29 age range and three deaths from this already). 

What the institute now needs to do is evaluate the background of this side effect (bad charge, medicine reaction to something else, specific preexisting conditions that increase the risk, actual risk of this occurring) to reevaluate the risk/reward of the vaccine. It could be that it's a cross-reaction with a specific medication mostly taken by younger women, in which case you can just slap a ""DNI if you take XY"" on it and move on. Could be that they don't find the cause but end up deciding that the risk is too high for the very low-Covid risk age groups so they'll get taken out of the AZ rotations. Or they decide the risk is low enough that as long as the people are informed of what the risk exactly is (i.e. they can say ""there is a x in y chance of this happening"") the vaccinations can continue as normal. 

AFAIK the UK is mostly using AZ for older people, right? Could be that mainland Europe is seeing these because of their younger vaccination pool. Could be some problems in manufacturing. Could be nothing. But we need to actually follow the normal procedure and figure it out. People have been saying ""The vaccines follow normal safety procedures!"" all along but now that they're still just doing that it's suddenly an issue?

The theater is at 40% capacity, and there wont be anyone sitting next to me 2 seats to my right or left, but there will be someone behind me.  I do go food shopping every 2 weeks, and there is much more people at the grocery store then will be at the movie theater, but everyone has masks on.

So my question is, is it foolish for me to go to the theater to see this movie AND eat popcorn while Im there? I know there is always some risk, but I dont see it as very high.

Edit: I felt like I should add some extra info.

My showtime is 4pm on March 31. Its the first showtime of the day, so no one will be in my seat since the Sunday before (the place is closed on Monday and Tuesday).  My community is Vestal NY, (I dont know how to look up the covid cases in my area).  When I wear my mask, it greatly fogs up my glasses and I cant see.  I always take the glasses off when Im food shopping, but if I take them off at the movie, I wont be able to see it.  I also do plan on eating popcorn, I dont intend to touch anything other then the popcorn bowl with my hands.  I asked the theater how many people are showing up for showtimes, and they said they are generally selling out. But that they are at 40% capacity, and everyone will have 2 empty seats to their right and left, so there will be a max of 20 people in the theater.  The theater itself is pretty spacious, but it does look like I will have somone sitting behind me. I might be able to change my seat, so that I have no one next to me from any angle.  I am in my high 30s, and not vaccinated, but am in quite good health, and dont have any pre-existing things that make covid extra bad for me. My roommate is getting his second vaccination shot on April 2. Other then food shopping, this would be the only time I am out of my apartment, Ive been a hermit for the past 6 months. This movie is a very big deal to me, and the only other option to see it is on my crappy home tv. I wont be able to get full vaccinated before the movie is out of theaters.  Even before covid, I only ever went to the movies maybe once every 3 years, and this would be one of those times, so that goes to show how big this movie is to me.

So my overall question is, whats the likelihood of me catching covid, if I go to the movie and take off my mask in the theater, and eat popcorn?  How muck of a risk to my life is it?",,,1615980846,{},gr85xpd,False,t3_m6ug1j,False,True,t3_m6ug1j,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m6ug1j/daily_discussion_thread_march_17_2021/gr85xpd/,1615980856,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The more outrageous the story, the more papers/ads/whatever they sell.

Take the vaccine as an example, in the UK its all being reported as the EU has failed to come up with a proper plan or strategy, whereas in the EU it's reported as the strategy is great - it's all Britain's fault as they forced AZ to halt shipments etc.

The truth likely lies somewhere in the middle.

Same with this. I'm certain the UK news would do their bit to keep the British public vaccinating themselves without a care right now. Just as I am certain the big Euro media would like to stick it to their previous ally. Again, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Norway isn't part of the EU (yes, the EEA, but not the EU) and wouldn't follow what some made up German chancellor told them. Same goes for Sweden, while they are in the EU they take every opportunity available to do the opposite of what Brussels tell them. Not to mention that Sweden has done their own thing this entire pandemic, yet they also decided, over night, to stop the AZ vaccine until the EMA could re-evaluate and see what's what.

South Africa halted its planned rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine in early February, when evidence emerged it might not be effective against a local mutated version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, called 501.V2 or B.1.351.

The variant has a number of mutations on its spike protein - the pointy bit the virus uses to enter human cells - which make it more infectious. 

The decision to halt the rollout of the vaccine - also known as ChAdOx1 nCoV19 - was made based on early data from a study by scientists at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. The full details of that research have now been peer-reviewed, and were published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine.

In the study, 750 people got two shots of the AstraZeneca vaccine and 717 a placebo. Of those who got the vaccine, 19 went on to develop ""mild-to-moderate"" COVID-19, compared with 23 in the placebo group. Of the 42 COVID-19 cases, 39 were the B.1.351 variant.

All-up, this gave it an efficacy of just 10.4 percent.

""A two-dose regimen of the ChAdOx1 nCoV19 vaccine did not show protection against mild-to-moderate COVID-19 due to the B.1.351 variant,"" the study concluded. 

In contrast, rival vaccines such as those made by Pfizer and Moderna have shown more than 90 percent efficacy against the original strain of the virus, though there are ongoing concerns they too might not work as well against B.1.351. 

While studies have found the AstraZeneca vaccine - like the others - is effective at preventing severe illness and death, a mysterious condition known as 'long COVID' is possible even after mild infections. People showing symptoms are also believed to be more infectious than those who catch the virus but don't get sick, potentially putting more people at risk.

The AstraZeneca vaccine, developed in conjunction with the University of Oxford, has had a troubled development. Mistakes were made in its trial phase, which led to some volunteers getting injected with the wrong amount; its effectiveness during its trials wasn't quite as good as that achieved by vaccines made by some of its rivals; and there have been recent reports it could be causing blood clots, prompting several countries to stop using it.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged countries to keep using it, saying there's no evidence linking use of the vaccine to blood clots, and even if there was, current data suggests the risk is still extremely low compared to that posed by COVID-19. 

ChAdOx1 nCoV19 is cheaper to produce and easier to transport and store than some of the other vaccines developed so far, making it a key weapon in the WHO's arsenal against COVID-19, particularly in poorer countries. 

Most vaccine manufacturers expect they'll need to make booster shots as new variants of the virus emerge, but they won't be available for months, at least. Some medical experts have predicted COVID-19 will become endemic like influenza - another disease that is here to stay, constantly mutating to evade existing vaccines. 

Its deadlier predecessor SARS was wiped out after killing less than 1000 people because it wasn't as infectious as SARS-CoV-2.",,,1615983303,{},gr899h0,True,t3_m6ymwt,False,True,t3_m6ymwt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m6ymwt/coronavirus_astrazeneca_covid19_vaccine_useless/gr899h0/,1615983313,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union on Wednesday threatened to take tougher measures to curb the export of COVID-19 vaccines, escalating an ongoing row with Britain and the Unites States over their restrictive handling of vaccine deliveries to the 27-nation bloc.

‚ÄúIf this situation does not change, we will have to reflect on how to make exports to vaccine-producing countries dependent on their level of openness,‚Äù EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference.

She said Europe just wants to make sure it gets its fair share.

‚ÄúWe are ready to use whatever tools we need to deliver on that,‚Äù von der Leyen said.

She warned that the bloc ‚Äúwill reflect on whether exports to countries who have higher vaccination rates than us are still proportionate‚Äù.

Our rate of vaccinations are very high, but part of me wonders when it's going to begin flattening. It's easy to vaccine people who are going out of their way to sign up and go get it, it's going to be much harder finding the hold-outs, especially in rural areas. Whether we like it or not, herd immunity will require the vast majority of people accepting the vaccine, even those on the fence.

I can think of 4 or 5 mechanisms by which a vaccine could clear long COVID symptoms.

The B cells producing these IgG antibodies are derived extrafollicularly and haven't undergone selection for self.  The vaccine induces germinal centers which would allow B cells to undergo selection for self, thereby clearing up cross-reactive antibodies.

[],,Dmitrygm1,,,[],,,,text,t2_tha9vg4,False,True,[],"Critical thinking is something that is severely lacking among people in general, while it has at the same time become increasingly important in the digital age. Unfortunately, a lot of Americans use the term 'critical thinking' without understanding what it is - critical thinking isn't just asking questions and 'doing your own research', it's about being able to evaluate sources of information and arguments in an objective and critical way, as well as being aware of your own biases.

In this case an example of critical thinking would be starting with the question: will lifting the mandate likely lead to higher levels of infections and hospitalizations? Then, finding evidence in support of and against your argument, and- most critically- evaluating this evidence! Is the source of information reliable? Is there any bias influencing any of the evidence?

What too many people do is start with an opinion or feeling, then trying hard to find anything that supports how they feel, missing the most important step- evaluation. Research should be focused on finding the answer independently of how you feel.

Let's look at the data and what we know:
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/

The fall in new cases in the US has been slowing down in recent weeks, that is clear.
It is also clear that the [B117 SARS-COV-2 variant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineage_B.1.1.7) is more transmissible than previous variants, and has been the cause of a surge in new COVID-19 cases across Eastern and Central Europe. It is almost a certainty that B117 will become the dominant variant across the US in the coming weeks.

Your body responds to being stabbed by a needle. In response to being punctured, your body increases blood flow to that area to facilitate healing. Increased blood flow creates an increase in pressure which puts strain on your nerve endings. Strained nerve endings send pain signals. This is the most common reason for pain after an injection.

Reason 2. Your skin has an allergic reaction to the vaccine at the injection site. Your body might not be thrilled that a foreign agent interacted with the skin and create a small allergic response in kind. This is fairly uncommon though.  

So than why didn't your shoulder hurt? It is possible that the person who gave the injection was more skilled than the person who gave it to your friend and caused less trauma to the area. You may have also been more relaxed than your friend which caused the needle to do less damage. Your friend may also just have a more sensitive injury response system than you do.

Why would Norway try to score political points? Sweden has suspended AZ vaccination and Astra Zeneca is 50% swedish and the biggest drug producer in Sweden. Why would Sweden sabotage their own company over political points? 

Germany, Norway, Denmark, Austria and other countries have paused vaccinations due to several cases of DIC, a serious condition that causes bleeding, clotting and low blood palatels and has a mortality of 20-50%. It is notoriously difficulty to treat. Norway has started vaccinating their health care workers recently and they already got 6 cases of DIC in female health care workers between 20 and 40 years old, 3 have died. Austria has reported 3 cases of DIC, two nurses from the same hospital, one has died. Germany has reported 7 cases of DIC in young females.

The decision was somewhat controversial. Some regulatory authorities took the view that the manufacturers had only tested 3 week intervals, therefore they should only dose at 3 week intervals. As far as I can tell, the JCVI relied on their experience with other vaccines and immunology generally to judge that efficacy probably would not diminish rapidly after 3 weeks. That seems to have been a correct call, but as a layman I have no way of knowing whether any luck was involved.

Of course, at the beginning of this year the UK was in a desperate situation. The new B1.1.7 variant was spreading rapidly and our hospitals were in danger of being overwhelmed.

It's worth pointing out that PCR target failure is not that uncommon. In the UK, the PCR testing used is a multiplex test that tests for 3 separate genes: S, N, and ORF1ab.

The ""UK variant"" is notable, in that the main S gene mutation is at a primer site used for PCR. As a result, this variant could be reliably detected without the need for sequence by a PCR result showing N and ORF1ab Positive, with S negative. This UK variant is now approximately 100% of circulating CV19 in the UK.

A separate sub-lineage of this variant has also acquired mutations in the ORF1ab gene, leading to gene target failure.

So hard to say. I should state...I'm totally not a doctor! I was briefly working on a project with MIT and some epidemiologists at John Hopkins at the beginning of the pandemic, and it triggered and interest in the data, so I've been ""in"" the data a lot over the course of the last year. 

If I pull up Oxford's Our World In Data, and look at testing per 1000 people, it looks like Canada and Norway currently track at about 660 / 730 respectively. If I look at our current test positivity rate vs Norway, we sit at 3.5% vs your 1.7%. Could this mean we have room to test a little more? ...Maybe? We certainly are very far behind the likes of Denmark when it comes to testing per capita, but so is most of the world. 

https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?country=ITA~KOR~USA~DNK~NZL~CAN~DEU~ESP~GBR~NOR

It is hard to say how much this contributed vs Norway, but our long-term, elder care homes were an utter disaster...we had to call in the army to get things under control. Staff got sick, spread to patients, and then there was even fewer staff to take care of them. We have both for profit and publicly funded homes.... 6.5% of all residents in for-profit facilities died of COVID-19, whereas 5.5% died in non-profit facilities. Our CFR for the 80+ is 25%. It was an absolute disgrace.

The amount of hydronium is what actually makes the acidity and it's measured with the pH. But not all acids are the same amount of good at that. HCl, the acid in the stomach is really good at it. Every single bit of HCl will turn one bit of water into hydronium. Weak, organic acids, like the acid in apples are really bad at it. That means that the same amount of bits of HCl- makes a much stronger acid than the same amount of apples acid. But what are the bits of apple acid doing that are not turning water into hydronium? They turn another bit of apple acid into a weak conjugate base. So a large part of the apple acid is busy with itself and doesn't make the water more sour. They are in an equilibrium. When the apple acid then comes into contact with the stomach acid, HCl knows it's the expert and better at the job of being an acid, so it pushes the apple acid out and takes the role of the acid parts in the equilibrium, while the base bits of the apple acid remain inside. The now unemployed bits of apple acid are bored, but only few of them are able to give protons to water and most of them just create a new equilibrium among themselves. More HCl bits spot the new equilibrium and push the acid bits out again, while the converted base parts remain. This continues until all of the apple acid bits are turned into base bits. As a result, in the stomach a lot of Cl- are missing that formerly were there, no longer creating a high concentration of hydronium. We remember, the concentration of hydronium that's the pH value, so pH sinks.

It's all well and good to say that, but the fact remains that renewables fluctuate in supply, and as the proportion of renewables in the entire market grows, the amount of energy storage you need to keep a steady baseline grows *dramatically*. For example, in a grid mostly powered by, say, solar power, at a small but significant proportion of overall production, you might need some energy storage to balance out the demand at night. At solar=100%, what happens when you need to prepare for a completely overcast summer? Yes, that's just an example because most places will have some amount of diversity in their renewables, but the point still stands that a grid needs a steady baseline and that has to come from either fossil fuels, nuclear, or very large amounts of storage.

It's vastly more economical, environmental and scalable for renewables to be balanced by a nuclear baseline than a mind-boggling amount of lithium-based energy storage.

&gt; In principle, I don‚Äôt dispute what you‚Äôve just said here. But in practice, the EU is out to punish someone.

They're looking to blame and punish external parties for sure, which is a shame. 

US was upfront about it's export situation, and every dose the US produces and uses is a dose that they otherwise may have imported, 

But in EU AZ confidence has been actively undermined with presidents claiming the vaccine is quasi effective, suggesting it only has 8% efficacy, etc and the recent pause based on adverse events building on the back of refusals based on side effects of inadaquecy. The fact is many regions in EU have large chunks of the limited supply they do have unused, whilst bemoaning that the UK is not sending over more of the vaccine produced domestically, just doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  Also extra capacity for other vaccines like pfizer &amp; J&amp;J is coming online but rollout pace is still slow in terms of daily dose delivered compared to places like US or UK

Biontech CEO urged EU leaders to commit to much more doses early on, (back when EU was initially billed 54‚Ç¨ per dose of Biontech/pfizer). The large order was delayed until much later, while they haggled on price and indemnification- now they want to retroactively stop exports and punish other countries based on the idea some places have more of their population vaccinated, but that's not how contracts work. that type of logic might work at the local neighborhood butcher shop but it's a recipe for geopolitical tension, it's nonsense.

The best vaccine is a vaccine people are comfortable taking. If people want to vaccine shop, let them.  In a matter of weeks we will have enough doses for that to be an easy thing to do.

There are legitimate advantages and disadvantages to each of the vaccines, and people should be able to make an informed decision based on that. 

 J+J likely is a lower efficacy at preventing symptomatic disease, but it also likely is about as good at keeping you out of the hospital and dying.  It is also more convenient for people to get one dose and a faster ‚Äútimeline‚Äù (2 weeks vs ~6 weeks) and doesn‚Äôt have bad side effects.

Pfizer and Moderna are likely both quite a bit better at preventing symptomatic disease.  If people are stressed about long Covid, let them wait to take one of these if they want, but make the argument to them that it would be better to take the first available.  Give reasons.  These vaccines also have real disadvantages in timeline and in pretty (only day long) side effects. 

All of these things are ‚Äúvalid‚Äù concerns, and your arguments aren‚Äôt going to convince anyone.

I don't think this is really true, assuming that similar-ish numbers of people will want each vaccine (which I think they will).  It isn't that hard to figure out which vaccines are being given out at which places.  Once things really open up (which will be in like 2-4 weeks), it will be as simple as going to a vaccination site with your vaccine of choice.

[Here](https://www.startribune.com/some-minnesotans-are-shopping-for-the-covid-19-vaccine-they-want/600034356/?refresh=true) is an interesting article about ""vaccine shopping"" in Minnesota. From the article:

&gt; ""The public health goal is that every person who can possibly get a vaccine gets it at the first second they possibly can,"" Ehresmann said in an interview. ""But it's not just a numbers game. People need to feel comfortable about the vaccine they are receiving.""

I agree with this.

&gt; My problem is that their constant shaming of other vaccines will cause other people to be hesitant for no reason.

Nobody should be doing this.  As I said, there are real, legitimate *advantages* to each one.  My girlfriend *actively* wants J+J, though she would take any in a heartbeat.  I don't think that is a ""wrong"" position at all.

I used to really want an mRNA vaccine, but I'm not sure that I care any more.  The convenience arguments and watching deaths/hospitalizations fall and things slowly move back towards normal make the two week timeline of J+J really tempting.

That said, many people are making dishonest arguments to try to convince others that the vaccines are ""all the same.""  These arguments will fail, and fail badly.

They were hit earlier. Sweden had time to stop the wave of death last spring and failed to do so.  

&gt;Plus while sure we have a few restrictions we don‚Äôt have any mask mandates in our public transport like you have just recommendations

The public transport mask rules in NZ are not enforced. Not a single person has been fined and compliance is about 50% at most.  We also don't have widespread public transport like Europe so it impacts extremely few people. 

&gt;Our shops and bars are all open since before the pandemic, we never suffered the economic consequences of a lockdown. 

The correlation between tightness of lockdowns and economic harm is the opposite of what you are claiming.  Nations with tighter lockdowns suffered less GDP loss.  NZ hasn't seen spikes in unemployment and the retail and hospitality sector has been saved by our V-shaped recovery.  That's thanks to people feeling safe to go out and shop.  

&gt;And quite frankly we've had 13K deaths of a population of 10M, that's literally nothing at all.

What a callous and horrific thing to say.  The US has lost more people than in WWI, WWII and Vietnam combined, in a single year.  Sweden as a historically neutral nation can't even compare this death toll to past wars.  

&gt;Covid is only 2.5x deadlier than the flu and with vaccines the whole world should already open up completely.

Every piece of evidence I have seen says that number is completely wrong.  A bad flu season kills 60,000 in the US.  So far 540,000 are dead from Covid.  The IFR is between 6 and 10 times the flu and since it is also twice as infectious that means it will kill 12 to 20 times as many people.  And the new variants are more infectious and deadlier, so those numbers are getting worse.  

Once everyone is vaccinated of course you can open up, but we aren't even close yet.  Italy has fully vaccinated 3% of their population.  In NZ we've vaccinated about 15,000 people out of 5 million.  It would be stupid to open up too early.  

&gt;If people are so scared of this mild ass virus then they can feel free to stay home with their dubble mask &amp; face shield until their vaccinated, but let us normal people get on with our normal lives already.

And here is where you prove yourself to be a Covid denier who will ignore any argument.  You're a hoaxer death cultist happy to kill everyone's grandparents so you can avoid wearing a mask... because... freedumb?  

&gt;Places without lockdowns have been doing fine and will keep on doing fine.

Sweden 1,299 dead per million.  NZ 5 dead per million.  But sure, no lockdown countries are just the same as lockdown countries if you like watching the most vulnerable members of your society suffer slow painful deaths. 

&gt;There is literally no point in doing a lockdown as you can never get rid of covid. 

Not locking down leads to collapse of the hospital system.  Sweden protected theirs by literally forbidding nursing home patients being sent to the hospitals, letting them die in their beds in mass numbers in the first wave.  Brazil's system is collapsing now.  Italy's hospital system collapsed in the first wave before they locked down.  NZ has among the fewest ICU beds per capita in the developed world, if we let the virus get to even close to the levels it reached in Europe we would have a total collapse of the medical system. 

&gt;Even in NZ there still are covid cases even though you got ""rid"" of it.

No, there aren't any community cases.  Not even one.  The only cases are in border hotels, picked up overseas.  When a case slips through we stop it spreading, every single time.  And of course it isn't forever. It's until we get people vaccinated.  We've got enough vaccines purchased to vaccinate everyone by September. It would be unbelievably stupid to abandon our successful strategy now.",,,1615988115,{},gr8h9i7,False,t3_m6qj2u,False,True,t1_gr8d3b4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m6qj2u/why_are_covid_cases_rising_in_europe_despite/gr8h9i7/,1615988125,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You are wrong.  Reopening should be done when it doesn't cause a spike of cases, that is not where we are right now.

I think reopening should be tied to specific % of the population receiving their vaccines, and mask mandates should be enforced until Herd Immunity is reached.  Again, the masks are nothing more than a mild annoyance and they are effective at preventing spread of the disease.  I'd be fine with being forced to wear them for another year while people get their shots if that's what it takes, because wearing a mask in public really isn't a big deal.  

I think it's *profoundly* selfish for people to think wearing masks is too great a sacrifice vs potentially saving even one life.

As I've said elsewhere on this thread, mask wearing only works if we all do it.  Saying that you personally choose to wear a mask but won't insist on others doing it is just virtue signaling and woke theater- you're trying to show off how considerate and safe you are while actually not caring if people die or not.

I have read that argument a couple of times on this subreddit, and can't figure who first came up with such idea.

International affairs of this importance ain't treated like 8 year old kids playing football, where when the owner of the ball loses a match and is forced to sit out, he grabs the ball and heads home so nobody else can play.

There would be a tremendous backlash if the UK did a move similar to that. There is a big, big difference between blocking vaccines exports and distribute them between your population, and simply blocking exports of vaccine components and let them rot.

If the UK has some place to send the vaccine components, then the ban could be a reality. But if it can't do anything with them, simply blocking the exports and stopping the production is really harming the whole world, and only for blackmailing purposes?

Yes, the Texas mask mandate removal did not apply retroactively and make people sick before it was removed.

I wouldn't expect it to make a massive difference even going to the future, at least in the short term - mask mandate specifically is about a 1% in cases per day to start, growing to 1.8%, and even adding up the effects of the other restrictions, the coming month is more determined by variants and other issues, and after that vaccines.
