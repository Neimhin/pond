Not in the stats that AstraZeneca are showing.. that's the point.

&gt; If there is actual evidence that these severe and unusual symptoms are occurring in vaccinated populations at a rate different from the unvaccinated population, that's a legitimate concern


One of the doctor treating the 3 patients who are still alive said he hadn't seen anything like it. Other patients with the same symptoms have been identified in other countries, all of them have taken the vaccine.


&gt; And if it's not increasing the overall mortality, and it's not increasing the number of significant clotting events, regardless of the location or etiology, 


This could cause both. The cases are more severe than normal clotting events. And they are also much, much harder to treat because using blood thinners on patients with already low platelets is dangerous.


&gt; Even if you know for a fact that the vaccine will cause an additional 5 directly caused deaths in a given population, if you also know that delaying the vaccine by X number of weeks will cause 25 additional deaths, the ethical thing to do is to still issue the vaccine.


The thical thing is to figure out how significant the risk is and then inform the population. If you decide to ignore these symptoms, telling people there's no need to wait and investigate, and tell people to vaccinate anyways, and it's then revealed that there was a correlation between these clots and the vaccine, then you're never going to get the population to trust you again.

Yep, we know. The AAP has consistently advocated for re-opening schools, but the part that gets cherry picked out is ""when it's safe to do so."" 

I have a number of teachers in my family, including my wife, at all levels. Kids are not acting in a responsible way in any of their schools for the duration of the day. 

And the teachers in this state have not been able to get vaccinations yet. 

I'm all for re-opening schools, but even the CDC's guidance fails my metro area with too many community infections to safely re-open. 


&gt; And also that covid doesn’t really spread much in schools, so it seems a very poor decision to have kept them closed 

That depends entirely on which data got cherry-picked. Covid doesn't spread much in schools where numerous levels of precautions are taken, where students follow the guidelines and are spaced apart appropriately. Where parents are keeping their kids home if they are symptomatic. That's not happening where I live. 

My daycare kicked one of my kids out because an adult exposed him and my boss is reminding me that it doesn't mean *I* have to work from home. Like I should just put a bowl of food and water out for my 1 year old and hope for the best between 8 and 5.

&gt;Non-vaccinated subjects who get asymptomatically infected will experience a short-lived raise in antigen-specific antibodies. The latter outcompete innate/ natural Abs for binding to the virus. At the same time, the longevity and affinity of these Ag-specific antibodies are not sufficient to protect them from disease upon subsequent exposure to the virus. The higher the overall infection rate in the population, the higher the likelihood the virus will bump into somebody who happens to experience a short-lived raise in Ab titers and hence, is subject to innate immune suppression. This is how and why youngsters are now becoming increasingly susceptible to the disease. If vaccinated, the suppression of your innate immune system just becomes much worse as these Abs are now long-lived and reach much higher titers than they normally do in asymptomatically infected individuals.

Masks, when used wrong, can increase spread. In Sweden this risk of increased spread has certainly been exaggerated. Now, since maks usage is not recommended there is no routines around masks in that environment, that makes teachers nervous and they decide to send the student home.

Personally, I don't think vaccines were wasted up to now, but after the AZ controversy [a lot of people are renouncing their vaccine](https://www.ansa.it/sicilia/notizie/sanita_sicilia/2021/03/14/vaccini-a-caltanissetta-lo-fanno-solo-194-su-600-prenotati_5d37f3cf-12c7-481e-8f6e-6b01f9a28873.html) so probably the country needs a more efficient plan to re-assign doses.

The study alone changed the consensus on reinfections, the fact that you're looking for genetic sequencing when you must know that at the time it was run, the US was sequencing less than 1:350 tests in absurd.

Sometime in the next few weeks, someone with 2 shots + 14 days is going to be put on an ECMO machine. 

I suppose when that happens, it'll also just be a meaningless data blip to you, too.

It really is something else that you implied that I might have a block from allowing me to see the data, and then pulled this song and dance, or maybe you didn't know about how little we were sequencing? I'm not sure with you, you seem much less informed than most medical sorts I bump into.

Why would you make such an intentionally misleading sentence? It's true on a technicality, but in reality Israel hasn't been in a lockdown half that time. 

&gt; You can say Israel is totally open, but the restrictions are still more than we have here 

It's not completely open, but it's pretty damn close. Where is here?

&gt;and thus we'll have a worse outcome given we're rolling back to little-to-nothing? 

Vaccine efficacy has nothing to do with restrictions as it's calculated on vaccinated and unvaccinated under the same conditions.

I'm not sure how can you use Israeli data to conclude that vaccines won't work alone, while the data suggests the opposite. Sure restrictions have not been completely lifted yet, but that's because Israel is extremely cautions. Still that's the clear trajectory we're going. 

We're going to lift the mask mandate soon, open up the airport even further, allow clubs and parties. All that in the next week. We wouldn't have been taking those measures if data was showing that vaccines are not sufficient.

The problem with the article posted by OP is that the data is not detailed enough. ""After 2 doses"" time period includes the first 1-2 weeks, before the vaccine achieves max efficacy. Worse than that, because of the lag between infection, illness and severe illness, people who are hospitalized days after the 2cond dose likely caught it before the vaccine has had any effect (12-14 days after 1st dose).

This is not a completely theoretical discussion, looking at Israeli COVID deaths in February we get this:

 

\- 935 COVID deaths in Israel in February.

\- 553 unvaccinated.

\- 240 after 1 dose (so between 1 and 3 weeks after 1st dose, of them 2 unprotected yet).

\- 142 deaths in the 1st week after 2cond dose.

\- **0 deaths 1 week after second dose.**

Ignoring essentially any potential argument about the study design and validity, which on its own merits doesn’t entirely prove reinfection, the data itself is just not impressive alone. None of my colleagues or friends would be particularly interested by this study. 

From all the other things you’re saying you don’t necessarily have to convince me there. Fundamentally I agree with you. But for different reasons. Primarily being we still don’t know how these variants will play out or the other unknowns regarding vaccination campaigns. 

If breakthrough infections occur I don’t think it’s going to be because neccesarily of vaccine failure, Americans being unhealthy, or whatever you’re theorizing. But rather because of mutation and selection pressure on the virus itself. 

The reason I even asked to begin with is because the claims you made, particularly of “high reinfection rate” and breakthrough cases, is so profound that it would change the way public health and medical professionals view the current virus landscape. I was concerned I had fallen behind on the data.

Given that Americans *tend* to be older than 18-20, more overweight than a new military recruit, and generally don't observe 100% mask discipline (nor get six weeks a year in strict isolation), while passing around variants that have established escape mutations:

# CORONAVIRUS/Taiwan COVID-19 drug gets positive review, clinical trials to advance

 

Taipei, March 15 (CNA) Taiwanese drug developer Senhwa Biosciences said Sunday that its investigational drug for the treatment of severe COVID-19 infections has received positive reviews from an independent monitoring group in the United States, and its clinical trials can go forward.

The oral drug Silmitasertib (CX-4945) is currently in phase two trial at Banner Health-University Medical Center in Phoenix, Arizona, which sponsored the research.

In an evaluation on March 11 of the data from the first batch of patients, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) said there was no need for modification of the trials.

Senhwa Biosciences can proceed to the recruitment of patients for the treatment of severe COVID-19, the company said in a release.

The DMC, also known as the Data and Safety Monitoring Board, is an independent group of clinical experts that monitors patient safety and/or treatment efficacy data during an ongoing clinical study.

According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's guidance, the DMC advises the sponsor on the continuing safety of trial subjects and those to be recruited to the trial, as well as on the continuing validity and scientific merit of the trial.

1) Israel basically achieves herd immunity through vaccination and cases eventually get down to zero. Mutations that occur in other countries do not impact the effectiveness of vaccination and therefore Israel remains virus free. 

2) There is a mutation in Israel and we get a vaccine-resistant strain (called the ""Israel Variant"") and the virus then attacks everyone who has already been vaccinated.

3a) Israel drives cases down to near zero, but a mutation occurs in another country that is vaccine resistant. This new vaccine-resistant variant gets into Israel and spreads among the population despite almost everyone being vaccinated.

3b) Israel drives cases down to near zero, but a mutation occurs in another country that is vaccine resistant. Israel manages to maintain tight border controls and prevents the new vaccine-resistant variant from spreading there. They would probably achieve this by putting incoming travelers into quarantine when they enter the country. 

The first scenario is the best scenario. Second is the worst. 3a is pretty bad, 3b is alright. 

What policies would I recommend instead? I don't think there are really any good solutions. The mass vaccinations might potentially make things much worse, so not vaccinating at all might be better than vaccinating in the middle of a pandemic. 

I'm not sure I really know what to do at this point. Maybe just bubble the vulnerable people and let the virus run its course. 

Maybe try to get certain geographic areas completely free of covid and gradually try to expand those areas. At this point, that almost seems like an impossible task.

Maybe the government should just do nothing and let people and businesses decide for themselves what to do. Maybe send out vitamin D pills to everyone or something like that. 

I agree that the vaccines have the potential to get us out of this situation... but they also have the potential to make the situation much worse. So I would hold off on the mass vaccination until we know more. Maybe try it out in one country, but keep the boarders super tight so that if it does create a vaccine-resistant variant, it doesn't spread around the world. See if it's possible to completely eliminate the virus without any consequences on a small scale before attempting it globally. Maybe pick an island nation as a test case so that if a variant is created through viral immune escape, it doesn't spread around the whole world.",,,1615786156,{},gqzgrks,False,t3_m55xlw,False,True,t1_gqzdnty,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m55xlw/the_vaccine_works_only_8_of_those_hospitalized/gqzgrks/,1615786167,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In short? While two shots + 14 days (or whatever it turns out to be) will be the highest antibody response, just after getting your shots is *about* as good as you're going to get, the response does degrade over time. America is already seeing clusters of these, and possible even transmitted from hospitals. 

That's a very indicator.

&gt;  collective antibody response

Well, that's what vaccine studies are, I'm not trying to be rude. Look at SA vaccine trial antibody response compared to Israel. 8x compared to 6x compared to less than, depending on the vaccine and trial. 

&gt;So what if less Americans get vaccinated (in this context) ? It is a RELATIVE RATE. Who said it was advantageous? What are you talking about?

In THIS scenario, where vaccine efficacy rate is lower than expected **AND** falling at a fairly rapid clip, then the absolute worst, the NIGHTMARE scenario then becomes two things:

- Americans get less vaccines than international counterparts

AND

- Americans lose even more social trust in their institutions because they believed vaccines would make them and their loved ones effectively immune

These things all coming together at once is walking down chucklefuck alley with no underoos on.

The lower the vaccine efficacy, the more you need 100% population taking it, being willing to take boosters, not being cynical of the results.

The worse off a vaccine does, the more you need other policies in place, and the better it is to have everyone vaccinated.",,,1615789478,{},gqzki2n,False,t3_m55xlw,False,True,t1_gqzjfbd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m55xlw/the_vaccine_works_only_8_of_those_hospitalized/gqzki2n/,1615789489,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I really don't feel like digging for publications. 

Well, I did the 10 second googling on your behalf



&gt; **It is true that natural infection almost always causes better immunity than vaccines** Whereas immunity from disease often follows a single natural infection, immunity from vaccines usually occurs only after several doses. However, the difference between vaccination and natural infection is the price paid for immunity [ I.e you get more sick the natural way]  

source: https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/immune-system-and-health

&gt;but there could still be room for reduction in shedding and onward transmission. 

&gt; Yeah, from 94% to 100% but that's a tall order for any vaccine. 

No, because the 94% refers to symptomatic disease only (and in addition fair few suspected cases were not included) in terms of reduction in asymptomatic and reductiom in viral load, the room for improvement is much higher than 6%. 

&gt;It's not really vague, it's just a summary from a qualified person.

As of right now, only about 15% of the population has been fully vaccinated.  An additional 6% or so have received at least their first dose.  That's about 20% of the population *plus* those previously infected and recovered (and we don't know how these overlap) who have some level of protection, and the rest who don't.  Let's conservatively put that number of non-protected at 70% of the population.  THEN, factor the number of people who HAVE been fully vaccinated, but will nonetheless become infected AND symptomatic enough to get tested and test positive.

That's the population of potential hosts for the virus *right now*: 70+% of the U.S. population. 

And as news of our vaccination successes spreads and eligibility expands, it creates this gap where people will *act* as if everybody has been vaccinated but the actual work of getting of shots into arms is still to be done.

Combine that with people seeing the falling number of cases from our January peaks AND good weather pulling people out of their homes and into community settings, AND governments (particularly state &amp; local) sending out signals that ""it's all over"", a larger and larger share of that 70+% of the population are inevitably going to engage in the activities that contribute to transmission.

We see this in TSA airline travel, with daily travelers approaching the 1.5 million per day figure: still well below normal (2019) numbers, but much higher than typical numbers during 2020.  We see it in restaurant bookings and retail foot traffic all on the rebound.

This is all wonderful of course, SO LONG AS the actual work of vaccination - instead of just good news - outpaces this increase in transmissible activity resumption.

Anything of whether the U.S. would approve the vaccine or not is circumstantial so it's incredibly jumpy to think Biden won't or will actually approve them. I won't take these kind of your arguments of whether he will or not do as a true answer to _everything_. Like I said, it takes time and patience, and it will come in a few weeks of whether the FDA would authorize AZ vaccine.

&gt;It's borderline immoral to block a private company from selling a life-saving product to other customers while you lock it away in warehouses as it slowly expires.

The U.S. isn't blocking AZ from selling anything, so quit making things up. The issue is that AZ ask the U.S. to led their American-owned vaccines to other nations, which won't happen. These doses you're speaking off aren't paid and owned by other nations, they're _American-owned_. It's not America's fault that other nations' priorities got screwed in terms of managing their vaccine supply line, and America is still facing 5,000 cases and 9/11 every single day. America is trying to meet its own timeline to vaccinate and no American citizen would stand for its own government putting foreigners at priority before America can be fully vaccinated.

Conclusion from the report:

Conclusion: The combination of mass vaccination and infection prevention measures is a recipe for a global health disaster. Following the science, one has to conclude that all age groups (possibly with the exception of small children) will be heavily affected and subject to rates of morbidity and mortality that raise much faster and much higher than those expected to occur during the natural course of a CoV pandemic. This will particularly apply if the sequence of mass vaccinations following the first infectious wave parallels that of natural infection (i.e., immunocompromised people and elderly first, followed by the younger age groups). No one, for that matter, should be granted a right to implement large-scale pharmaceutic and non-pharmaceutic immune interventions, especially not during a viral pandemic, and certainly not without an in-depth understanding of the immune pathogenesis of a viral pandemic. When one follows the science, and nothing but the science, it becomes extremely difficult to not label ongoing mass vaccination campaigns as a crime, not only to public health but also to individual health. 

To substantiate the reasoning above, the manuscript will first explain how components of the innate immune system can protect against Covid-19 and render infections asymptomatic. It will then go on to explain in more detail why and how, in an immunologically Covid-19-naïve population, selective (i.e., adaptive) immune escape shifts the first wave of disease and death from the elderly (and immunocompromised) subjects to those who at the outset of the pandemic got away with asymptomatic infection (i.e., the younger and middle-aged population segment). Similarly, it will be explained how accelerated viral immune escape in the asymptomatically infected population finally shifts back the burst of morbidity and mortality to the elderly, and how the population eventually controls the pandemic by controlling viral immune escape. This will already illustrate the critical importance of desiccating the changing contribution of innate and adaptive immunity to the population’s overall immune defense against a viral pandemic. Understanding these dynamics helps to comprehend the sophisticated course of a natural CoV pandemic, how it eventually merges into an endemic infection and why human intervention has a highly detrimental impact on the refined interplay between the virus and its host. In regard of the latter, the devastating global health impact of ongoing mass vaccination campaigns and accompanying stringent and widespread containment measures will be explained in more detail as the global and individual health consequences could simply be unbearable for many years to come. After the introductory section on innate immune defense mechanisms relevant to Covid-19, other relevant topics will be addressed in form of questions and answers. Last, a section will be dedicated to the scientific rationale for using NK cell-based vaccines that could provide sterilizing immunity and hence, wipe out Covid-19 and related variants all together.",,,1615793009,{},gqzo8ie,True,t3_m5f472,False,True,t3_m5f472,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m5f472/why_should_current_covid19_vaccines_not_be_used/gqzo8ie/,1615793020,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Data from the phase 1 trial of the Moderna vaccine suggested that neutralizing antibodies persisted for nearly 4 months, with titers declining slightly over time. Given the absence of information on how long the vaccines will be protective, there is currently no specific recommendation for booster doses. However, both companies are developing vaccines that could be administered as boosters, and that also have coverage for emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 less susceptible to vaccine inhibition. (Last reviewed/updated on 24 Feb 2021)

&gt; Specifically, right now it is not recommended that people wait for a new or changed vaccine in the hope that it will be more effective against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, though both Pfizer and Moderna are developing modifications to their existing vaccines designed specifically for broader activity against emerging strains.

The breakthrough covid phenomenon is being investigated. There to my knowledge hasn’t been a large amount of cases reported at this time. Even just by going on your google search request you can’t really come to this conclusion: 

Minnesota’s department of public health wants to track it and be notified but they’re not saying anything about case numbers. A lot of public health departments are issuing these directives to health providers. Minnesota’s just shows up on google. The Oregon hit has 4 cases (albeit it is interesting since there’s been reports of the immune evading variant in Oregon so it’ll be interesting to see that develope. 

You’re discussion about breakthrough covid though is making it sound like this is much more catastrophic then it is. 

Everything you’re saying about collective antibody response just sounds cockamamie and a lot of really interesting logical leaps are being taken that almost appear like you have some sort of bias guiding your idea on that. 

And then you made the claim on reinfection that you apparently are walking back on. 

Otherwise I agree with what you’re saying fundamentally. Americans and the world looks like it’s going to prematurely walk back safeguards because of vaccines before we have a full picture of what’s going on. I specifically like your point about how if Americans are let down it’s going to ruin their perception of vaccination and undermine efforts further.

It's possible this was not the case. 

not sure exactly what's going on in that thread you link but it looks like it's been brigaded and is running more on emotion than facts, which is odd for that subreddit which is quite strictly moderated usually. 

The top level comment is from an account that's been *very* active in posting what's essentially copy pasta about the AZ adverse events these past days over in r/europe, r/world news etc highlighting how strange this adverse events are.  That same user makes a whole bunch of unsubstantiated claims in that thread, and insinuates it's surely indicative of a bad batch or bad vaccine.  it's too early for people on the couch to make such assesments based on what is really preliminary data at this time.  We also do not have clinical reports or autopsy reports to the best of my knowledge and so any talk about DIC is premature guesstimation extrapolated from plugging symptoms together. 

 The highly upvoted reply to their top level comment is a brand new several day old account that pops up to confirm how weird it is, as if it's already been determined that this is what they experienced ( also.. it really isn't that weird in context of covid infections, as anyone who has been following the clinical reports from the early days can attest) 

I see a lot of posters on that thread you link who I've never see on covid-19 before, their usual home is more often r/europe. A couple of posters in that thread are most certainly writing some probably dubious info that I know they have been called out for in other subreddits. I'm surprised so many comments have not been deleted. 

Not suggesting there's nothing to this, that there is zero possibility of bad batch etc, we really don't know enough now, especially from our armchairs

but such symptoms are really not as atypical as is being suggested in that thread, and more importantly that thread seems taken over by some fresh people who are cultivating theories about clinical picture and explanation based on only few news articles, people that are not usually contributing to scientific discussion.

Israels restrictions are still lockdown, for over 70 straight days, with their airports having quotas per day of how many people can come in period, strict bans on a number of areas, etc.

MOST of their easing of restrictions has been the so called ""Green Pass"" system, which is letting vaccinated people into certain areas like gyms, keeping unvaccinated out (as policy).

So, just from a policy perspective (and there's LOT of reasons why the vaccine will be lower in Americans than Israelis from a population standpoint, this isn't even any part of that argument), the efficacy *will* be lower here, because we don't have the same level regulation to begin with, as we both ease ours as countries. 

The point is not to say the vaccines won't work. The point is the say that vaccines won't work alone, and not for any country, certainly as large with more challenges as America.

The country has recorded 1,594 domestically-transmitted infections, including 901 cases since the latest outbreak hit Hai Duong province and some other northern localities on January 27.

As many as 39,613 people who came in close contact with COVID-19 patients or arrived from pandemic-hit areas are under quarantine nationwide, including 503 in hospitals, 16,056 int other quarantine sites, and 23,054 at their residences.

The Treatment Sub-committee under the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control said that 2,086 patients have been declared to be clear of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 so far.

Among the patients under treatment, 48 have tested negative for the virus once, 48 twice, and 91 thrice.

According to the National Expanded Immunisation Programme, a total of 11,605 frontline medical workers and members of community-based anti-COVID-19 groups in Vietnam had been injected with COVID-19 vaccine as of 4:00 pm on March 14. The country began its COVID-19 inoculation campaign on March 8.

Quang Ninh, Dien Bien and Dong Thap provinces are to start COVID-19 vaccination this week.

Vietnam is to begin human trials of COVIVAC candidate vaccine, developed by the Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals (IVAC) on March 15 at Hanoi Medical University.

This is the second made-in-Vietnam candidate vaccine tested on humans. Earlier, Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology Company completed the first phase of human trials of its Nano Covax, and began the second phase on February 26.

SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, a variant first detected in the UK in September 20201, has spread to multiple countries worldwide. Several studies have established that B.1.1.7 is more transmissible than preexisting variants, but have not identified whether it leads to any change in disease severity2. Here we analyse a dataset linking 2,245,263 positive SARS-CoV-2 community tests and 17,452 COVID-19 deaths in England from 1 September 2020 to 14 February 2021. For 1,146,534 (51%) of these tests, the presence or absence of B.1.1.7 can be identified because of mutations in this lineage preventing PCR amplification of the spike gene target (S gene target failure, SGTF1). Based on 4,945 deaths with known SGTF status, we estimate that the hazard of death associated with SGTF is 55% (95% CI 39–72%) higher after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, care home residence, local authority of residence and test date. This corresponds to the absolute risk of death for a 55–69-year-old male increasing from 0.6% to 0.9% (95% CI 0.8–1.0%) within 28 days after a positive test in the community. Correcting for misclassification of SGTF and missingness in SGTF status, we estimate a 61% (42–82%) higher hazard of death associated with B.1.1.7. Our analysis suggests that B.1.1.7 is not only more transmissible than preexisting SARS-CoV-2 variants, but may also cause more severe illness.",,,1615834739,{},gr1kb0y,True,t3_m5s0qk,False,True,t3_m5s0qk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m5s0qk/increased_mortality_in_communitytested_cases_of/gr1kb0y/,1615837173,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;Wouldn't Americans ALSO be less likely to have a proper immune response to covid if we can't properly generate antibodies from a vaccine. Don't you think that MAYBE there is some correlation there that might, oh idk, even it out a little bit? This is my argument. Effectiveness is a relative number.

No, for a long list of reasons. To try and shorten them up, the little information we have already shows a higher rate of ""Break through"" transmissions, in addition to a high rate of reinfection, and that was before variant diversity came into effect.

In short? You can measure a countries' collective antibody response pretty effectively by how many people it's kept out of the ground over the course of the last 15 months.

That is the best indicator you can get for what future antibody response will look like.

Basically, all information says that the vaccine will work much less effectively in American's bodies, with America's policies and with the incredible logistical challenges that we have that a small country simply doesn't. 

This is of course totally bypassing the likelyhood that less Americans will get vaccinated and we're using a vaccine with a lower efficacy rate that they aren't.

And so many other, this is super short sum up list of only the most natural of consequences that will for sure happen.

There shouldn’t be any health reason not to get one whenever you can, and since vaccine distribution has been ramping up so significantly, I’m of the opinion that the 90 day courtesy wait should be out the window at this point.

I do believe that if you received monoclonal antibody treatment, there was a recommendation that it would indeed be best to wait the full 90 days after receiving that, but I’m not sure why and I haven’t heard that in a while so it may be an obsolete recommendation.

That’s like the coach leading the team on the field and saying “I’ve got no plan...just go out and do whatever you want.” The previous administration did nothing other than get big pharma to start working on a vaccine.

""Hematologists with expertise in treating immune thrombocytopenia said they suspected that the vaccine did play a  role. But they said that cases after vaccination were likely to be exceedingly rare, possibly the result of an unknown predisposition in some people to react to the vaccine by developing an immune response that destroys their platelets. The disorder has occurred, rarely, in people who received other inoculations, particularly the measles-mumps-rubella one.

“I think it is possible that there is an association,” Dr. James Bussel, a  hematologist and professor emeritus at Weill Cornell Medicine who has written more than 300 scientific articles on the platelet disorder, said in an interview. “I’m assuming there’s something that made the people  who developed thrombocytopenia susceptible, given what a tiny percentage  of recipients they are.”

He added:  “Having it happen after a vaccine is well-known and has been seen with many other vaccines. Why it happens, we don’t know.”

Dr.  Bussel said it was important to share information about the cases, because severe thrombocytopenia can be serious, and physicians need to know how to treat it. Sometimes the condition resists standard therapies, and if very low platelet counts persist, the patient faces an increasing risk of severe bleeding and even brain hemorrhage.

A few of the patients had previously had platelet disorders or other autoimmune  conditions that might have made them vulnerable, Dr. Bussel (pronounced  Bew-SELL) said. People can have low platelets without symptoms, and it is possible that in some, a vaccine reaction could drop the level further, to a point where it becomes apparent by causing bruises or bleeding, Dr. Bussel said.

Dr. Jerry L. Spivak, an expert on blood disorders at Johns Hopkins University, also said the connection to the  vaccine appeared real, but predicted that cases would be exceedingly  rare and called them “idiosyncratic,” perhaps related to underlying  traits in individual patients.""",,,1615838328,{},gr1sf1c,False,t3_m5m3d8,False,True,t1_gr1pilc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m5m3d8/germany_suspends_astrazeneca_vaccine_over/gr1sf1c/,1615841405,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Meaning that most likely the vast majority of people who are vaccinated not only will not experience bad symptoms but will also not be infected liekly because the body fights off the virus before it can replicate.

That's a good question.  They are cumulative. AND from what I can tell, they don't take waning immunity into account and presuppose that (previously infected) = (seroprevalence of antibodies at the time of the study). They specifically compare their estimates to total number of known cases to date.

Of course, to the degree that waning immunity after infection impacts the numbers, it impacts them in the direction toward fewer people having antibodies today, i.e., toward the possibility of another surge.  But I personally don't believe that this is a major *yet* (based on what we know about the current variants, and absent the emergence of some ""monster"" variant).

&gt;I just have to think that we've certainly gone over 50% just in infected, at least in most major metros.

I'm not saying that your gut estimate is 100% *wrong*, but I'm saying that your certainty for it might be a bit premature.  Again, I can't wait to see more recent seroprevalence data.

This is strange.  The vaccine has been rolled out for around ten weeks across 17 million people and there have been a vanishingly small number of cases. If there was a problem with the vaccine you would expect it to be spread fairly evenly across the whole continent in relation to the number of people who have been vaccinated throughout the last two and a half months. 

One hospital is reporting that they have three cases at the same time in young people and i have seen it brought up several times as evidence there is an issue with the AZ vaccine. Three cases in a small time period in a localised geographical area doesn't really point to a general vaccine problem that is being rolled out for a long time across a large area.

&gt;It was published by the Danish Medicines Agency on Sunday.

&gt;It is an unusual picture of the disease around the death that made the Danish Medicines Agency react. The Danish Medicines Agency found a similar disease picture in other reports in the European adverse reaction database. Norway has no later than Saturday described possible side effects that are similar in the disease picture, writes the Danish agency.

&gt;The Danish woman had an unusual clinical picture with a low number of platelets, blood clots in small and large vessels and bleeding, says unit manager Tanja Erichsen.

&gt;It was this death that on Wednesday prompted the Danish authorities to suspend the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine .

&gt;Norway followed on the same day, while the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency said that there was no reason to pause the vaccination .

&gt;On Friday, it became so known that a female health worker who had received the vaccine died on Tynset.

&gt;Then it emerged on Saturday that three additional health workers were hospitalized with blood clots, bleeding and low platelets at Oslo University Hospital (OUS). Everyone had received the AstraZeneca vaccine.

&gt;Chief physician Pål André Holme, who treats the three patients at OUS, described it as ""striking"" that three previously healthy and relatively young people get such an unusual picture of the disease after being vaccinated.

&gt;I have not seen anything in this street here before, Holme answered on Saturday when asked if he often sees similar cases.

&gt;The same picture of the disease had two people who died in Austria after receiving the vaccine, Steinar Madsen in the Norwegian Medicines Agency told VG on Saturday.

&gt;It is not known if there is a link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and the cases of blood clots and cerebral haemorrhages that have been reported in recent days. The vaccination with this vaccine has been paused while this is being investigated.

&gt;This weekend, FHI asked AstraZeneca vaccinated people who have a strong feeling of illness for more than three days, unexplained bruises that do not disappear when you press them with a glass or signs of stroke to go to the emergency room.

A Norwegian study of more than 2,600 people shows startling results regarding long-term effects after Covid-19 infection, reports TV 2. The University of Bergen, together with the University Hospital and American researchers, is conducting the study.

\- When we saw patients after six months, we saw that over 60 percent had long-term problems. We  saw that many between the ages of 16 and 30 had difficulty  concentrating, problems with breathing and memory loss, says Professor Rebecca Cox at the University of Bergen to the channel.

The study from Bergen shows that most women struggle with the late effects.

\- It only reinforces what we have said all along that Covid-19 is not like a regular flu, as in fact some still say. It  must be added that here a significant number have late effects, says  head of department and professor at the Department of Emergency Medicine  Dag Jacobsen at Oslo University Hospital.",,,1615766010,{},gqykugy,False,t3_m561k5,False,True,t3_m561k5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m561k5/60_of_covid19_patients_suffer_long_term_effects/gqykugy/,1615768519,1,True,True,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,moderator

In the final days of the Trump admin, distribution was horrendous and communication around it was non-existent. States were promised different amounts every day and had trouble planning whether to use reserve shots and gamble they’d have enough for 2nd rounds when the time came. In fact it was so bad, HHS even started telling states they were out of vaccines around January 20th. (1)

One of the first things the Biden admin did was smooth out communication. They immediately implemented a plan to tell states what to expect in terms of deliveries 3 weeks out. This was a huge shift in vaccine planning. All of a sudden states could count on the arrival of second doses freeing up more doses for 1st shot. If you want proof of this, just look at how percent of vaccines used change in the weeks following inauguration. It went from below 50% to near 80%. (2)

https://deadline.com/2021/02/joe-bidens-promise-los-angeles-vaccine-1234695922/

Additionally, the Biden admin took major steps to increase cooperation with states. This includes steps in terms of partnering with black and brown churches to distribute vaccines. These groups are among the most vulnerable and most skeptical of the vaccine. These partnerships and this communication will play a huge role in the declining daily deaths. (3)

Biden also signed orders allowing the pentagon to finally deploy troops to help vaccinate. In early February there were plans to deploy at least 1000 national guard members to set up and run vaccination sites all around the country. As these sites get going they still vaccinate up to 6,000 people a day. Many of these units have already started vaccinating folks and most definitely are part of the increase of % used and overall increase we have seen. (4)

Biden has also taken the personal steps expected of a leader to reinforce trust in the vaccine. Biden took both doses on national TV and actively encouraged people to get whatever shot they could when it was their turn. Trump secretly got the vaccine in January and told no one. (5)

The theory is not that the vaccine increases the amount of blood clots, it's that it causes a very small amount of very severe blood clot cases (combined with low platelets).. That wouldn't necessarily show on the statistics.

That is the same question. If the vaccine ""causes"" a severe side effect, but it doesn't cause it at a rate that is statistically distinguishable from the unvaccinated population, then it effectively doesn't cause that side effect in a meaningful way. It doesn't matter if that side effect is a sniffle or your head exploding. In fact, if you want to say that it actually ""causes"" the side effect, but not in a statistically distinguishable way, then you also have to essentially argue for replacement. Which is to say, if you have a 1 in a million chance of dying of a blood clot from taking a particular vaccine, and you also have a 1 in a million chance of dying of a blood clot if you're not taking the vaccine, and you are certain that the vaccine is causing the blood clot directly, then it must also be preventing some other number of blood clots in order to offset the additional numbers so that it still balances out.

This isn't to say it shouldn't be researched, just in case there is some confounding factor that would make it much more likely in some subset of the population (like perhaps a drug interaction), but at the macro level that is not a reason to stop overall administration in the mean time, given the known risks of *not* being vaccinated.",,,1615766791,{},gqym8f7,False,t3_m53lac,False,True,t1_gqyjzlw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m53lac/update_on_the_safety_of_covid19_vaccine/gqym8f7/,1615769192,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

However, while a lot of good people were doing work at the ground level there was a lot of chaos in the upper levels of the Trump administration. Any observer could see that Trump was more focused on the election, both before and after November 3rd, than he was on Covid.   


Take something simple like Trump's vaccination. That should have been an easy score for him, inviting the press to watch him get vaccinated where he could both encourage people to get vaccinated while scoring political points by touting his government's role in the helping vaccine development and distribution. But that event never happened and people didn't even find out Trump was vaccinated until months after. Trump was more focused on trying to overturn the election than fighting covid, which is unfortunate for both the American people and the Republican party. We have as many doses as we do now because of purchases made by the Trump administration, but their messaging was so mixed that just about no one will give them credit.   


Biden, on the other hand, has made covid his priority and has generally stayed out of the partisan fray. His administration hasn't done as much as some of his biggest proponents might suggest, they weren't actually starting from zero when they came in. But they have been able to clean things up and bring some order to the vaccine pipeline. The executive branch can't make vaccines out of thin air, but they can help organize and connect all of the millions of moving parts, cutting through red tape and cutting checks when necessary to keep things moving. It's not so much any one big thing as it is countless mundane deals and details that add up to a well-oiled pipeline.",,,1615762337,{},gqye79a,False,t3_m52afy,False,False,t1_gqxyyau,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m52afy/us_administers_1071_million_doses_of_covid19/gqye79a/,1615765253,19,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The study from Bergen shows that most women struggle with the late effects.

So lets look at this point by point. Did six 37 years olds die as you just claimed or was 37 the youngest age of the 6 people who died? Details are important.

When you say the probability of a 37 year old to die of a blood clot is a 0.000xx what do you mean exactly? Do you mean the probability of any given 37 year old to die of from a blood clot in a week? Id be shocked it was that high, frankly. If xx was a medium 5-0 that would be 10s of thousands of people in their mid to late thirties dying from blood clots every week in the EU. If you mean per year, that is still in the hundreds for any given week. Is that what you mean?

Also you cant just find some data points that look unusual in a vast sea of data and say QED as you are trying to. Thats a well known mistake. Here is the wikipedia entry on it. You will notice that the example used is extremely similar to the one we are discussing.

I was following the example provided by the person I replied to and I was highlighting why it isn't ideal to give a vaccine to a healthy 18 year old who lives with a cancer patient before giving it to a cancer patient themselves.

I think it's pertinent and in scope of conversation given that it's a type of protection induced by natural infection and this is a respiratory viral infection, we should be mindful that it factors into the comparison of natural vs vaccine induced immunity 

 &gt; The current vaccines have been shown to be incredibly efficacious. 

Indeed. Not disputing that, and this study supports that view.  But we have also seen studies of existing vaccines administered Intranasally vs intramuscularly with all indication being that the Intranasal route is as good if not superior, and that's especially intriguing in the context of coming closer to 'sterilising immunity', further blocking chance of progression to LRT, lung and reducing onward transmission.  Here's one such example; 
 https://mobile.twitter.com/DrNeeltje/status/1349067365418364928

&gt; Vaccinations offer longer lasting immunity compared to natural infection

I presume you're not talking about covid specifically since we couldn't know this yet on account of vaccines not existing for all that long,  and instead speaking in general. Could you link a source on that?

&gt; Also, not everyone who fights off an infection has to develop any antibodies at all

 True but most people do. The average seroconversion rate for iGG and iGM is between 90-100% 

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0897-1/
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33284684/

  Even across studies of asymptomatic seroconversion without neutralization capabilities people had mild or no symptoms, but it's somewhat moot imo because this study refers *only* to those with detectable antibodies (and not everyone vaccinated with produce sufficient antibodies either)

&gt; so having been infected before doesn't necessarily mean that you will fight off a future infection more easily. 

True, but the same goes for vaccines. Broadly speaking, the vast majority of people infected or vaccinated previously will fight off a future infection more easily. That's really how our immune system tends to work Irrespective of whether our immune system has been primed by a needle or through the nose

&gt; I will still take this study with a grain of salt,

Why? Im so confused, there's nothing really controversial here, it's a decent quality study.  

 &gt; because it really has been shown before that vaccines give stronger immunity than natural infections.

Could you link a source to where that's been shown? Preferably a scientific source and not a talking head from CNN who stated it.

[],,Salezec,,,[],,,,text,t2_468zgfxg,False,False,[],"As for the duration and quality of the immunity after vaccinations and natural infections, I know that from reading on it for both other viruses and SARS-CoV-2. I'd need to put a bit more effort into finding an actual study. What I have found is from this site by UCSF:

&gt;Is immunity from the vaccine stronger than natural immunity from infection?

“The first time your body sees the spike protein, it activates some immune system cells to begin to recognize and develop antibodies against that protein,” said Boslett. The response may be similar whether that first encounter is from infection with the virus or from the first dose of the vaccine.
Studies of the mRNA vaccines suggest that one dose may offer between 50 to 80 percent protection against symptomatic COVID-19, though more data is needed, said Boslett. “We know you get some amount of protection after one dose of the vaccine or after infection with the virus, but we don’t know in either case how long that protection lasts,” she said. Some cases of reinfection have been reported after three to six months, so the protection from one dose of the vaccine also may wane in that timeframe.
“However, when you get the second dose of the vaccine, you’re further training your immune system,” said Boslett. “You’re strengthening that response from the antibody-producing B cells and you’re also activating T memory cells that stick around for much longer.” Getting both doses of the vaccine means your body is shown this spike protein multiple times in a short duration. “So that immune response might be bigger, better and longer lasting than just getting the infection one time,” she said.
Because the booster effect is so important, Boslett adds that this is why people who have had COVID-19 are still recommended to get the vaccine.
VERDICT: Probably.


&gt;But we have also seen studies of existing vaccines administered Intranasally vs intramuscularly with all indication being that the Intranasal route is as good if not superior, and that's especially intriguing in the context of coming closer to 'sterilising immunity',

I remember you being a big fan of intranasal vaccines 😂

In the clinical trials of some of these COVID-19 vaccines, sterilising immunity is defined as decreased likelihood to detect viral RNA in the upper respiratory tract. As you said, it's very important for estimating how effective a vaccine is in preventing transmission. Pfizer's vaccine has been shown to be 94% efficacious in this sense in a recent real-world study from Israel. Is there published data on an intranasal vaccine being more efficacious in that sense?

&gt;Why? Im so confused, there's nothing really controversial here, it's a decent quality study. 

I don't find it to be controversial, it's just that it *is* contradictory to what I've heard before and what has been shown in the past. That's all. I'll wait to see more data or maybe even read more takes on this same study before I make up my mind.

&gt;I presume you're not talking about covid specifically since we couldn't know this yet on account of vaccines not existing for all that long, and instead speaking in general. Could you link a source on that?

We know that there have been reinfections with the same strain of the virus and it's been shown that the immunity lasts 3 to 6 months after natural reinfection. Vaccines are *expected* to provide immunity that is much longer lasting. Leading scientist that developed Sputnik V said that he expects his vaccine to provide immunity that lasts at least 2 years, based on their work on other viruses using the exact same platform and design for that previous vaccine. Again, these are just estimations, but they are still based on science and data.

I guess short term, got more vaccine available in the US faster, and caused much angst in Canada and other countries as Puurs production was curtailed for a short time.  Long term, it sounds like non-US capacity is being added to compensate.

All the US has to do is lift the restrictions on exports sooner rather than later.

On the other, health agencies in Norway and Denmark claim this type of blood clots are actually pretty uncommon, with the clots coinciding with a low number of blood platelets.

Can someone make sense of this? I also find it strange how 3 health workers from the same hospital fell ill in Norway, while there are other EU countries where there have been no adverse effects.

You must understand, there's a whole lot that you can do in many states right at this moment. Wanna go to a bar? Depending on where you are, you can do that. Wanna eat inside a restaurant? Depending on where you are you can do that. Wanna go to a movie theater? Depending on where you are you can do that. Wanna go for a walk/hike? You can do that anywhere. Wanna hang out with friends? You can do so responsibly.

What does this all mean? Well it means that what you can and cannot do comes down to your own personal risk assessment. Right now you may not feel comfortable in doing some of the activities that I listed (despite the fact that they may be allowed where you live). However, with each day that passes, each activity becomes less risky and more safe. 

This is all to say that once you feel COMFORTABLE in living your normal life again, many normal activities will be there for you, as they're already there as I write this out. As vaccinations continue to increase, and as cases/hospitalizations/deaths continue to decrease, you're getting closer and closer to that point where you'll say ""ok, I'm ready to dine-in/go see a movie/go to a bar etc."" That's how I look at this.

I know it feels like that point is so close yet so far away, and that feeling is frustrating/stressful but it really IS near. We really are getting close. To this point you've persevered, and you've managed to make it a long way. If anything that shows that you're a caring and kind person, it shows that you're wise in that you understand that the world is much bigger than your own individual desires.

[Here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.16.20194787v1) is the first study, and it was pretty good research for the time.  They took a lot of blood donors and did a seroprevalence test, then (using the logic of the time that antibodies were lost after a month or more) did some funky math to get final numbers.  The raw numbers are interesting in that they start high and then drop.  The consensus now seems to be that this was an overestimate - donating blood is a free way to get an antibody test, so those who thought they'd had it would participate.  The raw numbers dropped to a bit under 30% through (northern hemisphere's) summer, which is more likely to represent the true number since (as we now believe) there's no ""sero-revision"".

[Here's](https://mortalidade.com.br/am) the all-natural-cause mortality graph for all of Amazonas (population 3.4 million), or possibly just Manaus (population 2.2 million).  Median age of Manaus is 26 and only 2% of the population is over 70, so even in the absence of medical care you would not expect very high IFR.  Anything under about 30% attack rate from the first wave starts to give non-credible levels of IFR.   The second wave caused roughly twice as many deaths.

As there were no additional deaths beyond the first wave, the second paper concluding that the attack rate had continued to rise is nonsensical.  The actual serology numbers continued to drop, and only the sero-revision calculations made them seem to rise.  The only logical conclusion is that the lower numbers are more accurate.

[Here's](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.25.20201939v2) a different model in which they estimate the herd immunity threshold as 30% and the attack rate as 65%.  

Manaus is right on the equator in the Amazon, and gets a lot of rain.  The first and second wave both happened in the ""wet"" season.  The intervening period was the ""dry"" (less rainy) season.  This does give a possible explanation for managing many months of total suppression.  We've seen that when people are forced indoors, spread increases.

Nonetheless there is no ""good"" explanation for this data.  P.1 and P.2 were responsible for almost all cases at the start of the wave - by the end, it was just P.1.  During December, P.1 outpaced ""wild lineages"" nearly 4-fold per week in its growth.

As predicted end of last week, cases keep going up without stopping due to widespread ignorance and refusal to adhere to mandatory restrictions and mask use along with to little restrictions and no control on execution of restrictions.

The government announced that if cases to no stop, the next step will be again a country wide lockdown. 

As a reminder in Poland a lockdown means that cultural venues and hotels will be closed. Any sort of workplace or construction zone, factories etc. are still open but the government “suggests” to work from home if possible. Also mask use is mandatory at places of work but nobody follows that requirement and nobody controls it.

There’s also reports of widespread abuse of the loophole that professional athletes can go work out in gyms so gyms sign up their members as professional athletes in tug of war and other nonsense. Meaning everyone still goes to the gym.

Doctors warn that hospitals are filling up and patients getting younger ans younger.

On the upside, after 3 month of extremely slow vaccinations, 10% of the adult population has received at least one shot.

In my area, the city/state/county is my local health department and they are giving clinics based on front-line workers only, with elderly added in the last week. Up until about 2 weeks ago, if weren't not part of an organization (i.e. municipal school employee, town service, corporation) for which they were running their clinic you couldn't get an appointment. At the end of the day, they are taking elderly (65+) without appointments for ""spare"" doses. Hospitals have zero doses. Primary Care physicians have zero doses. (note: they are through their major front-line lists and are calling all registered residents in priority order now...but they will call you, not the other way around)

Random people deciding to wear masks of their own volition when they're sick (because the mandates are certainly going to go away, probably this year) isn't really a change to everyday life, it's just a personal choice. And yeah, after the pandemic is over, there will certainly be people who refuse to accept that they don't have to wear a mask anymore, but there were people like that after 9/11 too. They wouldn't go into large crowds for fear of a terrorist attack, and they thought you were insane if you did.

9/11 definitely changed large events as well. There is more security and restrictions as to what you can bring in to large venues than there were before. I remember going to hockey games when I was younger and you just showed them your ticket and walked in. You go to one in 2019, there's gonna be a metal detector, a pat down or wand sweep, and a list of things you can't bring into the venue.

9/11 also caused a cultural shift in America, by, one, throwing gas on the xenophobia fire, and two, the PATRIOT Act. Americans were willing to sign their privacy away due to fear of the great Other.

There are definitely more over arching changes to society as a whole after 9/11 than just air travel.

This is just straight up wrong. There is a very explicit export ban on any vaccines produced in America. This doesn't mean just doses the USA bought, but it extends to any doses *produced* on American soil. This means AZ, Pfizer, Moderna, etc. are explicitly prohibited from selling to anyone other than the US, if the vaccines were made in the US. [There are a million stories on this, here's just one.](https://www.dw.com/en/eu-seeks-us-supplies-of-astrazeneca-vaccine-report/a-56793089) (Obviously this doesn't apply to factories located outside the US, if that's the reason you're confused). 

Long story short. AZ operates plants around the world, including in the US. Those US plants, although not owned by the American government, are strictly not allowed to sell their product to anyone but America. They simply cannot use those plants to meet contractual obligations with other countries. It doesn't matter who paid what, who invested how much, who placed orders when. The only thing that the American-based factories are allowed to do is continue producing doses to add to America's stockpile.

You seem incredibly confused about the difference between American-purchased vaccines and American-produced vaccines. They are totally different concepts.

Completely agree with this. I'd go so far as to say that if we had gotten a sufficiently high/rigorous level of compliance, we could have brought covid to heel months ago.

Like if literally everyone stayed in for the same 4-6 week period, anyone who had it would either have gotten over it (and become non-infectious) or died (and become non-infectious). Barring non-human transmission, there would be no covid to go around.

But we half-measured so much.

Regarding the rate for immune thrombocytopenia, I'm not a medical expert, but it seems that is not exactly what these people have. That disorder refers just to the low amount of blood platelets, but later developing blood clots could be Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) or Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC). These conditions are much rarer. Once again, I'm not an expert, so I'll link the post where I saw this.

Frankly, ***given the information available at the time***, the EU strategy was perfectly sensible and if I were in charge, I wouldn't have done things differently.

When the vaccine agreements were being negotiated (late summer):

* The Covid situation in Europe was under control. If it worsens, EU could deploy the same successful playbook it did in late Spring
* Collectively, vaccine manufacturers were promising 800M doses by the end of 2020 worldwide, stockpiled waiting for regulatory approvals. The bottleneck was supposed to be the length of Phase III trials, not manufacturing capacity
* EU Commission focused on three goals - equitable distribution among member states, reasonable profit for pharma without price gouging, and liability for vaccines produced at profit - all perfectly reasonable goals
* EU hedged their bets by ordering a portfolio of vaccines if any one of them fails
* mRNA vaccines were an unproven bet - they're included in the portfolio, but more proven approached were given priority
* If there's one thing private sector is incredibly efficient at - it's the logistics of manufacturing and supply chains - their core competence. They know what to do. Getting public officials involved is generally a terrible idea, leading to needless frictions, delays and red tape
* One major leg of their strategy - Sanofi/GSK is the world leader in vaccine production, with manufacturing chains mostly in Europe
* The other major leg of their strategy - AstraZeneca, by far the most promising vaccine of later summer 2020
* Furthermore - the UK's priority agreement export-ban-in-all-but-name, hasn't been public. Neither has Israel's ""we-pay-you-to-experiment-at-us"" agreement

Covid worsened, the same playbook didn't help. Every single manufacturer overpromised by an order of magnitude. Sanofi vaccine flopped, not due to any first-principles problems, the approach is likely completely fine - it's failure was traced back to low dosage, caused by faulty readings on some antibody concentration sensor. That's just bad luck. AstraZeneca turned into a soap opera - that's just bad luck. Basically all major vaccine suppliers pulled some kind of shady business practice and acted in bad faith. Did anyone seriously expect all of those to turn out the way it did? And even then, EU's vaccination rate is merely disappointing, it's not disastrous by any means. All healthcare workers and most of the vulnerable population have received their jabs by now.

It turned out that the best strategy is to shower pharma with taxpayers money, with no strings attached, assume they lie through their teeth about everything, and furthermore assume they're incompetent bunglers that need constant handholding and surveillance to meet their targets.

Tell me which of the following you dispute and I'll provide facts to back it up:

*The AZ vaccine wasn't developed in America

*AZ is a European company and its factories are privately owned

*The US has imposed a blanket export ban on all domestically produced vaccines, regardless of whether or not they invested in their development. This isn't a DPA thing, it's a blanket ban. 

*The US is the only country with a vaccine export ban

*The US is on track to vaccinate everyone by May without needing a single AZ dose

*The AZ vaccines have a shelf life of 6 months

*The lipids required to producr this vaccine come mainly from the EU, UK, and Canada, and if these countries retaliated with their own export bans the US wouldn't be able to produce a single dose.

The short answer is that there is no reason to believe the Pfizer vaccine causes blood clots or clotting problems. For that matter, there is essentially no reason to believe the AstraZeneca vaccine does either.

The Pfizer bit is a pretty simple explanation: it hasn't been reported as being remotely significant or frequent at all despite millions upon millions of vaccines being administered around the world. There's basically no biological rationale at all to support that, and there's no evidence supporting that either. For what it's worth, I personally got the Pfizer vaccine, my entire family got the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, several of them actually have a history of clots, and I have absolutely *zero* concerns about their health with regards to this ""problem.""

The AstraZeneca decisions are also, frankly, baffling to me. There have been millions of AZ vaccines administered to date, with only roughly 40 individuals developing coagulopathies -- and frankly, among a white European population, I would not really be raising my eyebrows at that. That's very much consistent with -- and even below! -- the expected number of clotting disorders from that number of people just from random chance, which is why the EMA and WHO are currently saying there is no reason to believe the AZ vaccine is associated with clotting disorders.

I think this article by Derek Lowe sums up my thoughts on the matter nicely: https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/12/04/get-ready-for-false-side-effects. To quote the relevant section:

&gt; We’re talking about treating very, very large populations, which means that you’re going to see the usual run of mortality and morbidity that you see across large samples. Specifically, if you take 10 million people and just wave your hand back and forth over their upper arms, in the next two months you would expect to see about 4,000 heart attacks. About 4,000 strokes. Over 9,000 new diagnoses of cancer. And about 14,000 of that ten million will die, out of usual all-causes mortality. No one would notice. That’s how many people die and get sick anyway.

TL;DR -- please don't cancel your vaccine appointment out of fear of clots! There's no reason to at all.

In general, we can think of vaccine-related side effects as being either directly due to the components themselves or as the result of the body’s reaction to the vaccine components.

The first one is going to be a fear of a side effect from direct action of the mRNA molecules itself (or the lipid nanoparticles, but liposomal formulations of drugs are not uncommon, so that's not particularly new). That is unlikely to happen as a direct result of the mRNA after any significant period of time; as we know from decades of mRNA research, mRNA is so unstable that it doesn’t survive for a long time at physiological conditions. Rather, it is rapidly degraded and cleared and poses little risk of having some sort of side effect ""pop up"" later on. As such, the mRNA itself is overwhelmingly unlikely to cause issues that don't show up immediately.

The second question is on delayed issues that occur because of the body's reaction to the mRNA; essentially, we're thinking about autoimmune reactions here. As noted above, the vast majority of those cases will present within weeks of immunization, if they occur at all; the likelihood that we see an unforeseen autoimmune reaction in any significant numbers long after the vaccine is given out is very small. It's also worth remembering that these mRNA molecules encode for a protein already encoded by SARS-CoV-2, and to date, we haven't seen a massive rise in autoimmune reactions from that virus beyond that which we would expect for a widespread viral infection. To that end, if this vaccine causes a widespread problem in the future (which, again, is very unlikely), it would be reasonable to suspect this hypothetical adverse event would occur from natural infection as well.

In summary, the delivery system may be relatively new (although it's been used before in investigational drugs and has decades of underlying research, as noted in the post body), but the underlying biology of adverse effects is pretty similar to that of other vaccines.",,,1615845557,{},gr26hr1,True,t3_k96ng0,False,True,t1_gq8uzwt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/k96ng0/how_is_it_possible_to_create_a_safe_and_effective/gr26hr1/,1615851487,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; The success of COVID-19 vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA) is smoothing the way for using the novel technology not only in other vaccines, but possibly as treatments for cystic fibrosis, cancer and other hard-to-treat diseases.

&gt; Scientists say mRNA has the potential to target diseases that cannot be reached by conventional drugs.
...


&gt; U.S. emergency authorization of the vaccines - one from Moderna Inc and another from partners Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE – and their gene-based manufacturing processes has shown that the Food and Drug Administration is open to broader use of the previously unproven technology, according to interviews with eight top experts in the field of mRNA.

...

&gt; Billions of dollars in capital have flowed into mRNA-focused companies based on these raised expectations – hundreds of millions in the last few months alone. And with FDA acceptance, the field is attracting top scientific talent, experts said.

&gt; “There is more attention and focus on mRNA now that it has proven to be a technology that works,” said Glenn Hunzinger, U.S. pharmaceutical and life sciences leader at consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.

&gt; Regulatory authorization of the vaccines “accelerates the process” for other mRNA therapies, providing real-world evidence that it is possible to secure fragile mRNA components during manufacturing and distribution, said Josh Kellar, co-lead of Boston Consulting Group’s COVID-19 team.

&gt; The technology is often likened to the operating system on a computer, allowing drugmakers to alter their target by inserting new genetic code into a manufactured form of mRNA, a natural chemical messenger that instructs the body to produce specific proteins.",,,1615818128,{},gr0jdoh,False,t3_m5lmb5,False,True,t3_m5lmb5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m5lmb5/money_talent_flowing_into_mrna_sector_after/gr0jdoh/,1615818139,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

We went over this already, and such a statement can mean anything. The vaccine is contracted by the U.S. government and for the U.S. government even if it's a non-U.S. company, period. They're American-owned and are pre-approved for rollout. We _bought_ and _paid_ for these vaccines, period. It's just pre-approved ready for rollout while awaiting FDA EUA that will come in two weeks (which I find your statement ""AZ was [not] already under FDA consideration"" to be inaccurate). if I buy a certain product, that means I own that specific product. It's no different here with the AZ vaccines, and a country always puts its citizens first before the world.

The reason being even when the virus is successfully able to replicate in your body the immune system has been trained to fight the virus and neutralizes it more quickly to reduce the damage to the body. So it’s not simply that they’re suppressing symptoms but that they’re reducing symptoms by likely reducing damage and the ability for the virus to replicate successfully. Early on we were worried that we would still see asymptomatic spread but it seems more and more likely that asymptomatic infection is greatly reduced and even those who are infected don’t have as bad of health outcomes and are far less likely to spread it then if they were not vaccinated. This was a simplification and may not be able to say everything I’ve said with absolute confidence but I think it’s fairly accurate and a lot of the evidence points to this being true,,,1615836314,{},gr1nudy,False,t3_m5ewml,False,False,t1_gr1lrjo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m5ewml/daily_discussion_thread_march_15_2021/gr1nudy/,1615839057,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

1. We haven't (yet) seen huge numbers of fully vaccinated people being reinfected, which would mean we NEED the booster shots for vaccines to be effective 

2. We haven't (yet) seen reinfected fully vaccinated people present with severe disease

So, yes, it's good news we are working on boosters and having infrastructure and stockpiles ready just in case, but there's no need to panic yet. Current vaccines are effective. Even more so than we had initially hoped. This critical period will end for the general public.

My father has both liver and blood conditions and took extreme precautions as he almost died from bronchitis/pneumonia that was caused by the swine flu in 2009. He searched every day looking for some kind vaccine appointment (in addition to being “pre registered” through the he state) but they were all restricted to nurses, the elderly, and teachers. Keep in mind he is eligible for the current vaccine phase, but most places will not take folks with underlying health conditions.

I joined a local Facebook group for people searching for vaccines and basically out of pure luck I found a local clinic doing those with underlying health conditions. It’s 2021 and we have to resort to using a Facebook group to find vaccine appointments because the state/county registration systems are so awful. That clinic stopped taking appointments a week later because people were coming from all over the state and out of state to get vaccinated.

The most annoying thing is, I’m a college student, and I can probably list off about 20 people I know (all in their early 20’s) who have been vaccinated simply because they got a leftover vaccine or work at a grocery store.

Sometimes clinical trials are too small to find super rare side effects. It happens. It will take some investigation to figure out if the vaccine increases your risk of clotting. 

If it does, that doesn’t mean it won’t still be approved. Lots of medications have very serious side effects and they’re approved because of the good they do. For example, birth control is known to increase your risk of clotting but it’s still widely available and considered relatively safe to most people. 

So even if this vaccine increases a risk of clotting, that would just mean *some* people would be recommended to another vaccine. 

As someone with a genetic propensity toward clotting who found out after developing multiple PEs while on birth control, this is not the end of the world. I’d still encourage other people to use birth control if it’s right for them.

No it's not, what are you on about? The theory is not that the vaccine increases the amount of blood clots, it's that it causes a very small amount of very severe blood clot cases (combined with low platelets)..  That wouldn't necessarily show on the statistics.



&gt; If the vaccine had a rare side effect then it would show up repeatedly if given to a big enough sample size in the population

We have one in Denmark, four in Norway and two in Austria.
They all have similar symptoms, they have all taken the AstraZeneca vaccine, and there's not equivelent cases where the patient has not received AstraZeneca. You'd be an idiot if that did not raise some alarm bells.


&gt; If it's not about the general population then why stop giving the vaccine to the general population?


What do you mean? Do you think we know who is susceptible to these side effects beforehand? 


&gt; His response is essentially saying ""disprove that the vaccine caused this! No not with evidence! That's cheating!""


No, because AstraZeneca doesn't have evidence. It's not hard to understand. That the vaccine doesn't cause a high enough increase in blood clots to show on the statistics does not mean that it doesn't cause these severe cases. That's very simple.

Yeah, guess what, it's still happening. People are still dying, and there has to be something causing it. The most obvious thing linking them right now is the AZ vaccine.

So you have have 4 blood clot events with symptoms that a doctor who treats them describes as ""never seen anything like it"" and it all happens within a couple of days, and in several countries. And they have all taken the AZ vaccine, but you don't think that's enough to be worried?

&gt; If you can explain why my inability to point out a resource that is distributed in a universal manner between nation states makes my point of view that things shouldn't be this way batshit insane I'll concede that your response isn't completely moronical.

It shouldn't be that way because all those other countries have sovereignty over their lands, meaning there's no way for the US to enforce its laws over there. The most important implication of this is that we don't get to collect money from the people living in their lands, and so the ability of our government to give a fuck about those people is naturally limited. You might be happy to throw resources at people you can't control, but uncle sam is more risk-averse than you, and thank god for that.

Now if you propose that those other countries give up their sovereignty, then I'm sure the US would consider their annexation offer. But those offers typically never get made (mongolia is the one notable example I can think of in the modern era). In the reverse direction there is no shortage of examples as countries have been declaring independence at a rate of [~1 country per year since the 1800s](https://twitter.com/GrayInGlasgow/status/494863214371676160/photo/1).

I don't mind hearing about people feeling really tired and run down after the vaccine but learning about that particular side effect scared me.

I am aware that Covid-19 can cause nausea and vomiting so a small chance of one day of vomiting due to a vaccine vs a much larger chance of vomiting multiple days on top of many other symptoms (and possibly death) if I got Covid-19 is something I'm keeping in mind. So I am still going to get the vaccine when it is available to me but I'm very anxious about it (and of course, anxiety can cause psychosomatic symptoms like nausea). I may take some anti-nausea medication with me just in case I feel even a little bit nauseated after the shot. I think that will ease my anxiety about it.

I think if people have a bad reaction, they should report it and then STFU about it. Nobody needs to know that you had a bad reaction except for you, your doctor, and the vaccine manufacturer.

# The Paul Ehrlich Institute informs - Temporary suspension of vaccination with the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca

After intensive consultations on the serious thrombotic events that have occurred in Germany and Europe, the Paul Ehrlich Institute recommends the temporary suspension of vaccinations with the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca.

Compared to the status of March 11th, 2021, further cases (status: Monday, March 15th, 2021) have been reported in Germany. When analyzing the new data, the experts at the Paul Ehrlich Institute now see a noticeable increase in a special form of very rare cerebral vein thrombosis (sinus vein thrombosis) in connection with a lack of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) and bleeding close to vaccinations with the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca.

The data will be further analyzed and assessed by the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ).

Until the evaluation by the EMA has been completed , vaccinations with the COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca in Germany will be suspended. Today's decision concerns both initial and follow-up vaccinations.

This is stated by the Norwegian Medicines Agency at a press conference on Monday.

On Saturday the thirteenth, the Norwegian Medicines Agency and FHI stated that three people who had been vaccinated had been admitted to Rikshospitalet due to serious cases of blood clots. Rikshospitalet has stated that one of them is dead, says Steinar Madsen.

The deceased person was thus among the three health workers from Helse Sør-Øst who were admitted with a cerebral haemorrhage or blood clot after vaccination .

The person who died was a female health worker under the age of 50, who was transferred to Rikshospitalet from a local hospital on Friday. She died on Sunday, says chief physician Trine Kåsine at Rikshospitalet. She appeared fresh in advance, according to the superior.

At a press conference on Saturday, infection control director Geir Bukholm in FHI said that it was about younger people and that the symptoms were very serious, and special.

FHI decided last Thursday to temporarily stop the vaccination with AstraZeneca, after a 60-year-old woman from Denmark died after receiving the vaccine .

## This is what they are looking at now

The health authorities are investigating whether there is a connection between the AstraZeneca vaccine and special blood clot cases. It is not concluded whether there is a connection.

\- We assess whether there are similarities between the three patients that can say something about the reason why they have had such a special course of the disease, says Madsen.

The Norwegian Medicines Agency is working to gather all documentation and see if the course of the disease has a connection with the vaccine. They do this by examining all the side effects reports in the country that may have to do with blood clots. In addition, they receive data from Denmark and other countries.

In recent days, the Norwegian Medicines Agency has received about a thousand new side effect reports, says Madsen.

**- We work to go through and look at the most serious first.** **Most are transient side effects, such as fever and dizziness, usually go away after two to three days.** **We have not received any more reports of serious cases, says Madsen.**

The Norwegian Medicines Agency and FHI were also notified last week of a death following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine in the Inland. A young female health worker died after a brain haemorrhage. This is seen in connection with the blood clot cases, says Madsen.

\- It is a disease picture that will vary slightly from person to person, but the main features are present in everyone. What we have talked about: Low platelets, bleeding and blood clots

He also points out that the UK has vaccinated many elderly people with this vaccine.

\- They have vaccinated many elderly people, who react in a different way. If it turns out that there are differences from country to country, we must try to find out what may be the cause, says Madsen.

## Examined in Europe

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is reviewing similar cases to see if they may be related to vaccination, says Madsen.

\- There will be meetings at European level during this week. We will see what the discussions end in. Pausing the vaccination is a national decision, but has nothing to do with the approval of the vaccine, it is still approved

European health authorities have reviewed the number of blood clot cases in Europe associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine. A total of 30 such cases have been registered among five million vaccinated. Their conclusion so far has been that there is no basis for saying that vaccination leads to blood clots.

Madsen at the Norwegian Medicines Agency [told](https://xjigavcwfy5z7g4pn6cwygwdue--www-vg-no.translate.goog/nyheter/utenriks/i/VqjVn3/derfor-fortsetter-de-med-astrazeneca-i-sverige-har-ikke-data-som-tilsier-at-dette-er-farlig) VG [on Sunday](https://xjigavcwfy5z7g4pn6cwygwdue--www-vg-no.translate.goog/nyheter/utenriks/i/VqjVn3/derfor-fortsetter-de-med-astrazeneca-i-sverige-har-ikke-data-som-tilsier-at-dette-er-farlig) that there are two levels to investigate side effects at: Group-based and individual-based. He said there is no evidence that the AstraZeneca vaccine is associated with a greater risk of blood clots in the statistics, but that it is being investigated whether there may be side effects that are special and affect few people.

Sweden has not stopped vaccination, and the Swedish Medicines Agency says they have not seen the same type of cases as in Norway. Read more about why they think it is safe to continue vaccination [in this case.](https://xjigavcwfy5z7g4pn6cwygwdue--www-vg-no.translate.goog/nyheter/utenriks/i/VqjVn3/derfor-fortsetter-de-med-astrazeneca-i-sverige-har-ikke-data-som-tilsier-at-dette-er-farlig)

The UK has set a high number of AstraZeneca doses. But they are not in the talks with EMA, according to Madsen.

\- No, unfortunately they are out of the EU, do their own research, but of course we cooperate internationally across national borders. What is important now is to look at all the messages that are similar to what we have received in all European countries",,,1615815778,{},gr0eyd8,False,t3_m5ked5,False,True,t3_m5ked5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m5ked5/evidence_does_not_suggest_astrazeneca_jab_linked/gr0eyd8/,1615815788,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

If they're American-owned, they're American-owned even if its produced on American soil. Simple as that. There's no confusion, and your argument is incredibly driven-based narrative not backed up by facts, just like everything else.

&gt;A country, under normal circumstances, does not own the output of private companies located on its soil.

You're once again horrendously clueless how things work. Any relationship between a private company and a government would undoubtedly means the latter would get their hands on it and do whatever they want. In case of total war like WWII or public emergency like COVID, private companies which are contracted by the government gets paid by the government to produce a certain product and in exchange, the government gets to keep that product and do whatever they want. AZ last year was contracted and paid to produce the vaccine by the U.S. government under the Defense Production Act. In exchange, the U.S. government owns these AZ vaccines you speak off. They're American pre-approved stockpile ready for rollout. No one is legally entitled to American-owned vaccine unless it's being approved for export, which I said multiple times, we would know in a few weeks. So what's there to dispute?

There's no way AZ would break the contracts with the U.S. government during a public health emergency so that foreigners like yourself gets American-owned vaccine before Americans.

I'll leave SF out because it is a little more unique. COVID has totally ravaged the Hispanic community in both states equally.

The real reason that CA and TX have fared pretty equally is that lockdowns only work if they are true lockdowns, which in CA, they are not. Also, lockdowns can't last forever. People are still  getting together with friends and family and, as your said, essential work is still chugging along, exposing people left and right.

To be fair, there is not much the EU could have done to avoid this.

There are 3 vaccines available. Moderna came out of left field, and the EU leaned heavily on the other two. Turns out one of them is made by a company that is either incompetent or actively malicious and straight up lied to the EU on multiple occasions. That is not something the EU would take into account.

In fact, we would be about on par with the UK at this point, had AZ delivered as agreed upon in the contract.

Why is the UK faster? Having a fraction of the population is helping. The EU has its own home supplier in Pfizer, but unlike the UK and AZ, the European population is too big for one supplier. Hindsight is 20/20, but AZ seemed like our best bet at the time and we could not foresee that AZ would just go and screw us over.

Would more investment have made things better? Yes, but not dramatically better. AZ was always going to prioritise the UK and its allies, no matter how much the EU invested in them, and J&amp;J and Curevac are gated by their late approval, not their production capacity. Pfizer could have ramped up a bit sooner and we could have gained a few weeks.

&gt; It's a petty spat because the UK and EU aren't the best of pals right now and the AstraZeneca vaccine was a major success for the UK.

The EU has literally nothing to do with the blood clot thing.

I've posted a few studies in the past which demonstrate robust, lasting protection of natural infections against reinfection which translated to equivelent or superior protection to what's been observed with vaccines, although at the time they were referencing phase 3 trial data:

https://www.reddit.com/comments/lm0mc2
https://www.reddit.com/comments/llzpzr

&gt; Is this study on healthcare workers different in some way that could explain that?

There's nothing radically different about this study except it directly compared natural infection in the same setting, with two seperate vaccines in real world and also covers variants. No revolutionary findings but it's a useful confirmatory study, very pleased to read it. 

As for the conflicting info bit- from an antibody perspective alone, you could say vaccines give 'stronger protection' (compared to responses from convalescent sera) but of course there are qualative reasons the current intramuscular vaccines could conversely be considered slightly inferior to natural infection- ie no induction of mucosal immunity

I think there's plausible explanations as to why health agencies suggested and will continue to suggest vaccination gives better protection, and that's to encourage people getting vaccinated and to discourage people getting infected naturally. If they were to acknowledge openly 5 months ago that people who were previously infected were essentially safe (as was plausible) there would then be many millions of people already infected at some point in the past who would be getting increasingly agitated upon restrictions placed upon them.

 In effect, in some regions 10-30% of the population have been 'fully vaccinated' for many months now yet living under lockdowns, unable to travel, unable to socialize etc. It would introduce additional complexity to sort people into previously infected or not and treat them differently so logistically easier just to vaccinate everyone and say we can reopen things when a certain threshold is vaccinated. 

I think the most interesting takeaway from this study is the confirmation that naturally infected people had even lower viral loads than vaccinated people. Bodes well for vaccine candidates like Bharat Biotechs nasal spray. I would hope that the countries currently banking on vaccine passports would consider this, and update to consider previously infected people as vaccinated based on the risk of them transmitting being lower;  but that one's probably less likely .",,,1615809139,{},gr04otm,False,t3_m5hxoe,False,True,t1_gr016ur,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m5hxoe/two_doses_of_vaccine_offer_same_protection_from/gr04otm/,1615809149,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

An early study of 1000+ hospital patients in China for example, reported 36% with low platelets upon admission to hospital 

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32109013

There have also been several accounts of post-viral immune thrombocytopenia, occuring after covid infection e.g

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhae/article/PIIS2352-3026(20)30175-7/fulltext

We would possibly expect in settings of the ongoing spread of a more infectious variants (b117) to be seeing more cases naturally anyhow

Also as of last month, there have been at least 36 similar such cases from Pfizer or Moderna vaccine in US (out of a total 31 million doses): the following story previously got some attention after the death of a Dr in Florida, forcing both Moderna and Pfizer to issue statements that the vaccines were sadw after many antivax platforms took statements from a John Hopkins professor that suggested there was likely a link, to advance their own agendas

With sample sizes this big, we're bound to see some kind of mortality- and of course it's going to be under the microscope, but so far, these numbers are not really statistical outliers.  For example, Last year Flu vaccinations in South Korea were paused after 25 deaths, including a 17 year old (that was based on 8.3 million doses, a smaller amount of innoculations that what is occuring with the covid vaccines rn)

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/22/doctors-in-south-korea-call-for-flu-vaccinations-to-be-paused-after-25-deaths

Right now, many Italian regions have suspended batches of the AZ vaccine or entire AZ vaccinations after several deaths post vaccination. To the best of my knowledge the only one that has been fully investigated and autopsied has been determined not to be linked to the AZ vaccine, similar to the death of someone in Italy that had received the Pfizer vaccine (was ruled an unrelated stroke). 

Again, worth pointing out that number of deaths are not itself so unprecedented,In 2014, the Italian Medicines Agency suspended as a precautionary measure the use of two batches of flu vaccine after three post-vaccination deaths 

The researchers estimated that, ""by pure statistical chance, 15-20 people die every day in Italy during the two month flu vaccination campaign within 48 hours of vaccination. ""

Now moving on to what you mention in your closing paragraphs about Norway, 3 cases in the same hospital would certainly be a little more intriguing. I just went to research that a little to find the number of employees at hospital etc. 

but wasn't able to find any evidence that those 3 cases were in fact from the same hospital.

So the first link from UCSF is a bit of a vague hypothesis rather than evidence based, it's not entirely illogical at all but it's not like we can verify it at this point. It seems to be just as much making the case for two doses over one as it is for making the cases for vaccine over natural infection. 

The provable data we do have, with those two links I shared earlier for example shows us that even in high risk settings like hospitals or in care home setting full of immunosenecent individuals that typically have subpar or faster waning immune responses we see 94-96% protection from reinfection even 8 months after being naturally infected.  Importantly, some of these re infections were 'distinct' 

Wrt to longevity, we saw with the original SARS outbreak 90% of patients had detectable antibodies (iGG) after 2 years 

[Duration of Antibody Responses after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851497/)

Antibodies started waning, and were found in 50% of patients after 3 years, however

&gt; Unlike waning serum antibody levels in patients, CTL responses against the S and N proteins can still be detected from the PBMCs of recovered SARS patients 1, 2, 4, 6, and even &gt;10 years post-infection

In fact here's a more recent study of 23 SARS patients (patients that were obviously naturally infected not vaccinated) that found all still possess long-lasting memory T cells' reactive to the virus 17 years later 

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z_reference.pdf

Obviously longer lasting protection is ideal. But we don't necessarily need lifetime immunity, I mean sure a lot of what's ideal will depend on whether this becomes endemic or whatnot, and I'm definately not making the argument we should go for natural herd immunity over vaccination, there's clearly a long list of reasons why we vaccinate, but whether immunity lasts 2 years or 4 years might not be such a huge deal, if one is making the argument about dose prioritization for example and arguing that they should put previously infected people at back of the line for vaccination 

&gt; I remember you being a big fan of intranasal vaccines 😂

Aye, I have high hopes for them.

&gt; Pfizer's vaccine has been shown to be 94% efficacious in this sense in a recent real-world study from Israel. Is there published data on an intranasal vaccine being more efficacious in that sense?

Not in terms of numbers like that, because they're only in phase 1 trials for now, moving slowly.  Clearly against vaccines like pfizer the room to improve is limited, but there could still be room for reduction in shedding and onward transmission. 
 
&gt; I don't find it to be controversial, it's just that it *is* contradictory to what I've heard before

Well to be fair if it's anyone thats got a vested interest in promoting vaccination, which would be most governments, health agencies, pharma companies , doctors, physicians, really anyone remotely sensible or professional  it's not going to be that surprising the messaging leans towards vaccination being important, similar to how the messaging about handwashing is emphasised. 

 &gt; and what has been shown in the past. 

still confused about that though, I've seen other studies of other diseases that suggests natural immunity is typically stronger than vaccination, even with the flu this is true yet for obvious reasons vaccination is still prioritized 

&gt; That's all. I'll wait to see more data or maybe even read more takes on this same study before I make up my mind.

Fair enough 

&gt; We know that there have been reinfections with the same strain of the virus 

Of course, but we also know some of these purported reinfections (same strain, not genetically unique) turned out to be actually lingering virus or even dodgy testing.  and we also know that you can be vaccinated and later infected, that's why these vaccines aren't advertised as 100% efficacy

&gt; and it's been shown that the immunity lasts 3 to 6 months after natural reinfection.

Where did you read that? That's way outdated, we know natural immunity typically lasts *at least* six months, more recently thats changed to more like 8 months based on several large studies, I linked one such example above, only a few reinfections seen at 8 month mark 

 &gt; Vaccines are *expected* to provide immunity that is much longer lasting. Leading scientist that developed Sputnik V said that he expects his vaccine to provide immunity that lasts at least 2 years, it was in an interview I saw, so can't provide you with the source.

It's okay I heard the same interview. I know what you say there is true 

&gt; Edit: Also, being vaccinated with many of the first gen vaccines does guarantee that you'll fight off a future infection more easily. Efficacy in preventing severe disease in many of these vaccines is 100%.

The studies were not adequately powered to to assess impact on severe disease at population scale though (as real world data already proves, see israel data on hospitilization of fully vaccinated vs not vaccinated vs partial vaccinated for example)

absolutely the results against severe cases or death are statistically significant and absolutely vast vast majority of vaccinated participants will have better chances against severe infection in future which is intuitive-- but that 100% can't translate identically to real world

Also the same is true of natural infection, it's our immune system that's doing the heavy work here not the vaccine itself. If you're previously exposed to virus chances are you're going to be in better shape next time however it was exposed to you",,,1615819416,{},gr0lxyj,False,t3_m5hxoe,False,True,t1_gr0fjyv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m5hxoe/two_doses_of_vaccine_offer_same_protection_from/gr0lxyj/,1615819449,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

If you close it on a hair trigger, you’d be closing the borders every 3 years in my opinion, for stuff like Ebola and Zika.* 

The thing is, if there is even a sniff of a pandemic coming from Africa or South America, the world shouldn't be afraid of closing the borders or denying entry people who travelled to these countries cause they aren't nuclear powered crazies who throws a hissy fit if they dare mention the though of something bad originating from them.

 *Additionally in my opinion the west doesn’t have enough border security to maintain even 99.9% effective border control. Our borders are leaky.* 

The refugee crises was a wake up for the EU that they needed to really take control of their borders, they had bad state actors in the East, bad state actors flowing from the south and through Syria

Honestly, I think there isn't great data (because we're looking at dynamic and [practically] open systems--it's like reviewing socioeconomic data, where you have to take reasoned guesses to identify and then strip out confounding effects). (And when you think about it, of course the data isn't/wasn't good. Like, if we had good data, the answers would have been obvious. There would be no controversy about lockdowns/restrictions at all.)

That said, it's not zero data.

Time- and place-bounded do show effectiveness in places like New Zealand, Taiwan, etc.

And... logic and a modicum of common sense/common knowledge would show effectiveness just in terms of you personally. (Like, covid virus doesn't just spontaneously materialize out of thin air. It comes from somewhere. So if you shut yourself in and have some concept of Germ Theory of disease, it would have to be a fluke if you caught it.)

Anyway, the argument should (abstractly) be the same as herd immunity...

Below certain levels of compliance, restrictions don't do anything. Below certain levels of infection, there is no herd immunity (the virus can theoretically just circulate indefinitely).

Above a certain level of compliance, restrictions choke off the spread. Above a certain level of population infection, herd immunity can exist.

I don't want to get too mathy on it. Intuitively, it's [the Game of Life](https://playgameoflife.com/) writ large. This reminds me, there was also a pandemic/infectionator type flash game from like 15 years ago (where you try to infect the world, so you choose mutations, like airborne v water v intervivos, durability of the virus, severity of illness, mortality, etc. in efforts to spread globally by avoiding national quarantines, etc. Like, if you're a virus with low mortality and mild symptoms, officials will mostly ignore you--just like in real life.

be education, period.

The Pfizer vaccine FDA report doesn't give a nice summary like this, but they do report 23 people became pregnant during the trial. They report 2 adverse events related to pregnancy, both in the placebo group.

Both companies say they will continue to monitor pregnant people. In general, there is no know reason why a vaccine would affect fertility. I don't believe any ever has before. While mRNA technology is new-ish, it's not so radically different that there would be any reason to believe fertility would be affected.

For anyone who is not familiar with the **Lessons Learned from Polio:**

By the early 1950s, polio paralyzed [13,000 to 20,000 children every year](https://www.historyofvaccines.org/timeline#EVT_100325).  Pressure for a vaccine was overwhelming. Virologist Jonas Salk began  work on a vaccine in 1953 under the assumption that if the body was  presented with a vaccine containing “killed” polio virus, it would  create antibodies protecting it from live polio virus. The trick was to  inactivate the live virus just enough so it could not cause infection,  but not so much as to destroy its structure and prevent antibody  production. Within two years, Salk’s vaccine went from development to  field testing in nearly 2 million children.

On April 12, 1955, Salk’s vaccine was [declared to be safe and effective](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmp048180).  Within three hours of this announcement, the federal government granted  licenses to five pharmaceutical companies to begin producing the  vaccine. Thanks to political pressure, mass vaccine production,  dissemination, and inoculation began on April 13.

Within days there were reports of post-vaccine paralysis. Even as the  number of children who developed polio after getting the vaccine grew,  repeated assurances of safety by the vaccine developers combined with  minimal federal oversight allowed polio vaccination to continue for an  additional three weeks.

When the surgeon general finally [stopped vaccinations on May 6, 1955](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1955/05/06/Government-halts-vaccine-approval-pending-safety-review/6251941041623/),  40,000 children had developed vaccine-induced polio, 200 were  paralyzed, and 10 had died. Salk’s inactivation method had been used  incorrectly by several manufacturers, and 200,000 children had received  vaccines containing live poliovirus.

Meier’s analysis of the vaccine program’s failure is a cautionary tale for coronavirus. Writing in [Science magazine in May 1957](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/125/3257/1067),  he noted that government leadership accepted without question the Salk  laboratory’s assertion that the vaccine was “absolute\[ly\] safe.” He  critiqued the elimination of safeguards in the rush to fast-track  production. He uncovered the fact that a vaccine manufacturer hid  relevant safety data from the public. He concluded that if an  independent monitoring program had existed, the manufacturing flaws  might have been identified before distribution or, at worst, the program  could have been halted when the first cases of vaccine-induced polio  were reported.",,,1615829024,{},gr17f1m,True,t3_m5otpk,False,False,t1_gr14c8h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m5otpk/trudeau_says_astrazeneca_vaccine_is_safe_after/gr17f1m/,1615830484,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I'm in support of policies that would make it more ideal under my definition, I didn't say I wasn't at any point. What I literally said in your quote is that I'm not proposing any (in any of the comments in this thread).

&gt;other countries have sovereignty over their lands, meaning there's no way for the US to enforce its laws over there. The most important implication of this is that we don't get to collect money from the people living in their lands, and so the ability of our government to give a fuck about those people is naturally limited.

I agree. That's why I said it's a sad state of the world that it is this way. I don't think the US is in the wrong when acting out of self-interest in the current scenario.

&gt;Now if you propose that those other countries give up their sovereignty, then I'm sure the US would consider their annexation offer.

Yes, a world government would be ideal to solve global problems provided it's a democratic one. A country that doesn't have an idiotic common law tradition and has a better legal system would be better suited as a foundation but beggars can't be choosers. I'll take the US annexing the whole world.

Additionally in my opinion the west doesn’t have enough border security to maintain even 99.9% effective border control. Our borders are leaky.

Anyway here’s what the UK pandemic preparedness strategy in 2011 said about it. It’s mainly talking about pandemic flu because that was the main concern. 

&gt; The Foreign and Commonwealth Office will issue advice regarding travel to affected countries. There are no plans to attempt to close borders in the event of an influenza pandemic. The UK generally has a high level of international connectivity, and so is likely to be one of the earlier countries to receive infectious individuals. Modelling suggests that imposing a 90% restriction on all air travel to the UK at the point a pandemic emerges would only delay the peak of a pandemic wave by one to two weeks10,11. Even a 99.9% travel restriction might delay a pandemic wave by only two months. During 2009 it became clear that the pandemic virus had already spread widely before international authorities were alerted, suggesting that in any case the point of pandemic emergence had been missed by several weeks. The economic, political and social consequences of border closures would also be very substantial, including risks to the secure supply of food, pharmaceuticals and other supplies.

The simple answer is that science has vastly greater experience making vaccines than antivirals, so there's a lot more existing technology and expertise to leverage when making a vaccine.

&amp;#x200B;

Making vaccines is fairly straightforward. Your immune system is designed to learn how to recognize foreign proteins and destroy them. So developing a vaccine is just a matter of figuring out how to safely get copies of viral proteins into a person's body, then letting the immune system do its thing.

Developing an antiviral drug is a different ballgame. You're not leveraging any existing systems in the body. So you're searching for a compound that interrupts the virus's replication, but does no harm to the person. This is ***really*** difficult, because viruses and humans share a lot of the same molecular machinery (so it's difficult to find something that targets just the virus), and that machinery is really complicated (so it's difficult to find something that is effective at all).",,,1615832975,{},gr1gbbo,False,t3_m5ewml,False,True,t1_gr0y2bp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m5ewml/daily_discussion_thread_march_15_2021/gr1gbbo/,1615835102,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I could have wanted to talk about the special rules as it relates to particular IRS codes, or treatment of payments (above Part 3) as it relates to 1324 of title 31 of the USC, or have a discussion about how literally one sentence within a multi-hundred page document uses definitions based on subsections from other laws - meaning, to have effectively read this bill, you'd need to read dozens of other laws with familiarity of the United States Code and IRS special provisions, totalling in over twenty thousands of pages.

My position has always been the same. My original comment was just saying how it's less than ideal that vaccines aren't distributed to those that need it most first.

At no point did I criticize any country for what they were doing, not the US nor any other country. I don't expect countries to act in a different manner, they act in self-interest as they should from their perspective. This is what I called the sad state of the world.

After your first reply misrepresenting everything I said and assuming shit I didn't, I assume out of a sheer lack of reading ability in your native language and not out of malice, you brought up the US annexing countries which from my perspective isn't exactly a bad idea.

Immunity from the vaccine [lasts *at least 6 months*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l9nfu8/stable_neutralizing_antibody_levels_six_months/) probably a lot,[ lot longer,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6a6pq/durability_of_responses_after_sarscov2_mrna1273/)  probably many years. It's looking like it'll be permanent or [semi-permanent in a good portion](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m1xbz4/sarscov2_mrna_vaccines_induce_a_robust_germinal/) of the population.

Covid19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, OG SARS was caused by SARS-CoV. Looks like both came from bats.  [They’re 79% the same.](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930251-8) (PDF)

[This was encouraging,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmp5doo/) regarding the efficacy of vaccines against variants.

Pfizer [seems fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lf7uph/neutralization_of_viruses_with_european_south/) against the troubling variants, at least in the lab. At the very least, the mRNA vaccines [*still* work](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfp89k/neutralization_of_sarscov2_spike_6970_deletion/) on the three most worrying variants.

Most variants aren't great at being viruses.  Some, including [that one mink variant,](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/19/danish-covid-mink-variant-very-likely-extinct-but-controversial-cull-continues) have already gone extinct. I think there are other Mink variants that have made it into wild Mink populations, but that doesn't mean that it's definitely going to stay in Mink forever (it might, though).

**Vaccines Seem to Reduce Spread**

Vaccination and previous infection[ reduce viral load, which reduces spread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s).

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) * article does a good job of explaining the likelihood of vaccines *at least* reducing spread.  [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lf744r/daily_discussion_thread_february_08_2021/gml0gyi/) may help too. Data from [Scotland looks great](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m3tx1n/covid19_vaccine_linked_to_a_reduction_in/). 

[""Moderna vaccine blocks &gt;90% (87-93%) of infections &amp; 91% (89-94%) of transmission.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmqfk4q/)

Milder cases, especially asymptomatic cases [are worse at spreading](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kcy2e0/weekly_question_thread_week_of_december_14/gg8tp7n/).  

Looks like the amount of virus in people who've gotten one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and then infected is [greatly reduced compared to those not vaccinated](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfiqma/decreased_sarscov2_viral_load_following/).  This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a great reduction in ability to spread the virus. [Maybe even with just one dose!](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242) You should [get both doses though.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m2mtnv/immune_response_to_sarscov2_variants_of_concern/)

Reinfections are rare, some studies show [less than 1 in 1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kyj0bx/sarscov2_reinfection_in_a_cohort_of_43000/) (maybe in the 1 in 10,000 range, you'll have to read the study, it's awesome).  Reinfections tend to be much milder than previous infections, even those new variants.

Any answer you get that is either ""yes"" or ""no"" is wrong, for now. We have only ""maybe, probably not"", and it's going to be that way for a long time.

Challenge studies with monkeys and the results look [*really good.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03041-6) They show strong immunity, or [sterilizing immunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/la4fud/immunogenic_bnt162b_vaccines_protect_rhesus/) from multiple vaccine types.  We're still figuring out if and how much sterilizing immunity can be expected from the current vaccines, though it's starting to look really good.

Also, you'll notice that any reputable person talking about this subject always says ""may be able to spread"", or ""maybe"", or ""we don't know if"". And that's because there is a small chance that vaccinated people will be able to spread the virus. But it's not a big chance. Doctors, scientists, and regulators are being very careful with their language on this subject, some would argue they're being too careful. That said, if they were to say that ""vaccinated people cannot spread the virus"", and then we find out that in some situations that vaccinated people have spread the virus, [that would end up worse for them than if they hedge for a while.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/los8r9/daily_discussion_thread_february_21_2021/goa8cu0/) So at least to me, the way they're framing it seems pretty reasonable, you just have to put yourself in their shoes.

That said, they seem to be [saying what I've been saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s). 

**Additional Thoughts/Cool Stuff**

Testing and the Positivity Rate: It's been said a lot in other subs that the positivity rate should go up over time as more people are vaccinated and don't require testing. Last year, it was *the* metric to watch, but it will likely wane quickly in importance as overall testing drops.  Don't necessarily worry about sudden high positivity rates, as mass testing will likely drop off pretty quickly, particularly as testing sites are converted to vaccination sites. 

We may want to use our newly found testing and sequencing capacity to test and sequence a higher proportion of flu samples.  This might give us a head start on which flu genetics are circulating, and help eliminate a flu or two.  We're in the single digits of flu cases most places, which is awesome!

The problem is that you have to wait longer for the second dose, and therefore, full protection.

Just because [mRNA vaccines aren't 100% effective](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/)  against the SA variant, *doesn't* [mean that we'll definitely need boosters](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgvaxv/mrna_vaccineelicited_antibodies_to_sarscov2_and/gmu581s/).

I like [thegracefuldork's prediction about vaccine availability](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lcatpp/daily_discussion_thread_february_04_2021/gm0bwc8/) more than my own previous prediction.  Not because it's ""rosier"", but because it's just better.

**Which vaccine should I get?**

When someone asks me what my favorite beer is, the answer is always the same.

It's the one in front of me.

So get the first vaccine you can, the differences are pretty minor.


[**Conclusions**](https://gfycat.com/cleantalkativedassie)

Okay, so the vaccines reduce infections, and if someone gets an infection after getting vaccinated, they have fewer and reduced symptoms.  This currently seems to also be true with post vaccination infection with any of the known variants. We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with mild symptoms spread only slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well. 

In other words: A reduction in symptoms is at least correlated with a reduction in the ability to spread the virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections and symptoms in those who do get infected. Therefore, vaccines should reduce spread.

Regarding side effects of the vaccine:

Nobody is saying there aren't side effects. There are clearly side effects. I'm not even saying there aren't side effects from the vaccine that could last for years. The effects of an infection may not show up for a while, [and we know they can last a long time](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m4jhpf/rapid_implementation_of_a_cohort_for_the_study_of/), most notably a loss of sense of smell.

I'm saying that we'd find out about all the side effects within a few months. There won't be side effects that suddenly show up six months after vaccination that haven't already shown up in some people.

If you have an example of a side effect from any vaccine where side effects not seen within the first four months were suddenly found over four months post-vaccination, I'd change the wording in my post.

I'll tell you though, I've still not gotten an example of a vaccine side effect that didn't show up in at least some people until way after the vaccine was administered.

I get plenty of ""look, this vaccine used decades ago in some tiny country rarely causes this one long-term side effect, so you're wrong"", which doesn't address the point I'm making.",,,1615836671,{},gr1onc5,False,t3_m5ewml,False,True,t3_m5ewml,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m5ewml/daily_discussion_thread_march_15_2021/gr1onc5/,1615839479,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
