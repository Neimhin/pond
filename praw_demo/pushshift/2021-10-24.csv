After Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei refused to accept vaccine donations from Western countries, the Islamic Republic has sought to make the shots domestically, though that process lags far behind other nations.
The supply of non-Western shots remains low, creating a black market offering Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech shots for as much as $1,350 in a country where the currency, the Iranian rial, is on the verge of collapse. Meanwhile, U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran mean the cash-strapped government has limited funds to purchase vaccines abroad.

&gt;“People are using it because they’re so anxious about Covid, and anxious about the state of affairs in the world,” she added, referring to booster shots.  
&gt;  
&gt;Generally, scientists on the two committees are asked to vote yes or no on questions posed to them by the federal agencies they are advising. In some cases, committee members said they voted one way or another simply because of the way those questions were phrased.  
&gt;  
&gt;In December, when F.D.A. advisers evaluated the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for people ages 16 and older, the evidence for its use in 16- and 17-year-olds was limited.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Archana Chatterjee and three other committee members voted against the vaccine and were criticized for it. But Dr. Chatterjee said she would have voted differently if the F.D.A. had asked about authorizing the vaccine in adults 18 and older.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We were basically told, ‘Here’s the question, and say yes or no,’” said Dr. Chatterjee, a pediatric infectious disease expert and dean of the Chicago Medical School. “We were also not given the opportunity to explain the vote.”  
&gt;  
&gt;In subsequent meetings, the F.D.A. allowed the science advisers to request changes to the question and to explain their votes. But they are still restricted to voting only on the data included in a company’s application.  
&gt;  
&gt;At a recent meeting, for example, some F.D.A. advisers said they wanted to recommend that Johnson &amp; Johnson recipients have the option to choose any vaccine for their booster. But the F.D.A. only asked the panel to vote on a booster of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.  
&gt;  
&gt;One of the panelists, Dr. Stanley Perlman, said he voted yes because it was clear that Johnson &amp; Johnson recipients would benefit from a second shot. But the unanimous vote signaled far more confidence in the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine as a booster than he felt, said Dr. Perlman, an immunologist and coronavirus expert at the University of Iowa.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Perlman said he was opposed to boosters for younger people at first, but voted in favor for other reasons. In the case of health care workers, for example, “I didn’t want to have any nurses or doctors staying home because they had asymptomatic” infections, he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Several experts said they have tried to be clear about the limitations of the data and the rationale behind their decisions. But communicating in the midst of a pandemic has proved to be tricky.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Through no intentional fault of anyone, the messaging has been challenging — and then there’s a lot of misinformation, which is tragic,” Dr. Kotton said.  
&gt;  
&gt;In approving the boosters, however reluctantly, federal agencies and their advisers may have given Americans the impression that two doses were not protective enough, some experts said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“They continue inadvertently to damn the vaccine, when what they should say is, ‘It is remarkable,’” said Dr. Offit. “It’s a  miracle vaccine.”

It astounds me that an agency like the CDC makes the decision not to collect data on breakthrough infections - unless it results in hospitalization or death - and then complains that they don’t have enough data.  

I know, I know, we need the vaccines to prevent hospitalization and death, not cases.

[],,Viewfromthe31stfloor,#46d160,,[],02cc5c36-ae80-11eb-a76b-0e911ea99c5d,I'm fully vaccinated! 💉💪🩹,light,text,t2_3nelaphm,False,True,[],"&gt;Australia, home to the world’s longest lockdown, is scrapping quarantine requirements for vaccinated residents returning from overseas. New Zealand, famed for its commitment to a “Zero Covid” strategy, abandoned it this month. Around the world, people are vacationing, visiting family and resuming business trips across international borders.

&gt;Not China.

&gt;The country where the coronavirus pandemic began is also the only one in the world still trying to completely eradicate the virus within its borders. Officials have repeatedly dismissed the idea of living with the virus, citing China’s large population and their success in containment so far — even as the country has continued to record sporadic outbreaks, triggering mass testing and strict lockdowns.

&gt;”Every locality should firmly adhere to the policy of ‘Defend externally against importation, defend internally against rebound,’” Mi Feng, a spokesman for the National Health Commission, said at a news conference on Sunday. “The current control measures cannot be relaxed.”

&gt;China has continued to record local cases — around 130 in recent days, after a spate of cases linked to domestic tourists. Parts of Beijing, Inner Mongolia and Gansu Province are under lockdown. Schools and businesses in those areas of Beijing are closed, and organizers of the Beijing Marathon, which had been planned for this weekend, announced on Sunday that it would be indefinitely postponed.

&gt;China’s tough stance on loosening Covid restrictions is possible in part because of China’s huge domestic consumer base, which has helped to keep retail spending afloat, and because of the ruling Communist Party’s tight grip on power. The authorities can implement lockdowns and mandate multiple rounds of testing with astonishing efficiency.

&gt;In addition, many Chinese are satisfied with the government’s approach. Domestic travel has surged in areas with no cases, and the country’s low death rate — it has officially recorded fewer than 5,000 deaths — has become a source of nationalistic pride, especially at a time when China’s relations with many other countries are growing increasingly fraught.

&gt;Xi Jinping, China’s leader, has repeatedly pointed to China’s success in containment as proof of the superiority of its governance model. When Zhang Wenhong, a prominent virologist, suggested this summer that China learn to live with the virus, he was attacked viciously online as a lackey of foreigners

&gt;There is a clear incentive for China to remain closed off, at least in the short term: With Beijing set to host the Winter Olympics in February, officials have acknowledged that they are under pressure to keep cases under control.

&gt;Still, the question of sustainability looms. China’s economic growth is slowing. The country’s diplomatic efforts may also suffer from its long isolation; Mr. Xi has not left China or received foreign visitors since early 2020, even as other world leaders prepare to gather in Rome for a Group of 20 summit and in Glasgow for climate talks.

&gt;Some officials have started to tentatively broach the idea of loosening restrictions, though without any timelines or firm commitments. Zhong Nanshan, one of the country’s most prominent doctors, told a Chinese magazine this month that China could begin opening up when vaccination rates had exceeded 85 percent, a goal that could potentially be reached this year.

&gt;But, he added, there was another caveat: Other countries would also need to get cases under control.

I would say it’s a quirk of the data.

I would also say that lots of other data sets show that infection risks are higher in unvaccinated:

So as soon as things went remote many people at our company were offered way more and moved. We lost 18/20 software engineers on my team. And it is one of the better places to work in Utah. Higher wages, ESPP, RSU, 401k match, 100% paid healthcare, unlimited PTO, free food, healthy work environment, etc. Just couldn’t match some of these other places. 

Also, many of the people working in services like restaurants were laid off in the early stages of COVID and went to tech boot camps to fill the crazy need for software engineers.

My understanding (not a medical professional, but I was curious so I googled) is that the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) keeps the recipient from getting *sick* if they catch polio, but they can still transmit the virus. So they'd be an asymptomatic carrier.

The oral polio vaccine (OPV) prevents transmission, but there's also a risk that the vaccine recipient can pass on actual polio for a short time after vaccination.

I categorized it as Americans being ""intense"" or ""extreme"" but maybe it is just the lack of subtlety in the dissemination of information.

We were told and shown (reference to studies) by the government and scientists from the beginning that vaccination is never a 100% effective and never a 100% safe. Of course it isn't. How could it be? That's not how reality works. But it was made very clear that the chances of an adverse effect of getting Covid versus getting the Vaccine and then maybe getting Covid (the chance of that happening is already significantly diminished by the vaccine itself) are very different. And yes, they said that the long term effects of the vaccine are unclear but that all currently available data suggest no significant difference to other vaccines.

At the end of the day it is a matter of trust I suppose since nobody is really able to verify all claims. I would need to get a degree or at least the education of an virologist, pandemic specialist, medical doctor, lung specialist, immunologist and several others to check all of it myself. No matter how far along the knowledge track you are at the end of the day you have to either trust or not trust someone.

&gt;That follows a protest Sunday night at the Barclay's Center in support of Kyrie Irving.

&gt;A crowd of people rallied as the Brooklyn Nets lost to the Charlotte Hornets at their home opener without their point guard.

&gt;At one point the protest turned violent when some demonstrators tried to break into the arena, clashing with security and police.

&gt;Irving has refused to get vaccinated. As a result, he's not getting paid.

&gt;The same could soon be said for thousands of city workers if they don't get the shot by Friday.

&gt;That's the threat from Mayor Bill de Blasio with vaccination rates lagging behind the general population at several large city agencies including the NYPD and the FDNYP.

&gt;""It's time now. If you don't want to get vaccinated, you'll be put on unpaid leave. Well, the vast majority of human beings go to work to get paid. And also, I think for a lot of our first responders, there's a calling. They believe in the work, they care about the work. Those two factors I think are going to cause the vast majority to get vaccinated,"" Mayor de Blasio said.

&gt;The mayor did offer a $500 incentive for city workers to get vaccinated and even that's causing controversy, with several unions now demanding back pay for workers who already got vaccinated without a bonus.

&gt;Also on Monday, the PBA filed a lawsuit in Staten Island state Supreme Court seeking to overturn the vaccine mandate.

&gt;PBA President Pat Lynch said they will also file a request for a temporary restraining order asking the court to bar the city and the NYPD from implementing the mandate while the suit is pending.",,,,1635179599,{},hi03rik,True,t3_qfkl3f,False,False,t3_qfkl3f,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qfkl3f/nyc_workers_march_across_brooklyn_bridge_in/hi03rik/,1635327885.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CDC guidance is that a whole new vaccination would be unnecessary:

&gt; People who were vaccinated outside the United States with a currently FDA-approved or FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine or a World Health Organization (WHO)-emergency use listed COVID-19 vaccine2 and who have received all the recommended doses do not need any additional doses. People who received the first dose of an FDA-approved or FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine that requires two doses do not need to restart the vaccine series in the United States but should receive the second dose as close to the recommended time as possible. Similarly, following completion of their second dose, these people may receive a booster dose &gt;6 months after a Pfizer-BioNTech primary vaccine series (if indicated) or an additional dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine &gt;28 days after an mRNA COVID-19 primary vaccine series if they are moderately to severely immunocompromised.

Asking people to prove that filters filter on the basis that perhaps filters don't filter seems like a strange thing to argue about on the internet, and not one that I personally would want to engage in.  Why argue basic, well established science?

It seems to me that the basic problem with vaccination is that if the herd immunity threshold is 80% (r=5), then we need a vaccine that can reduce transmission by 80% or more.  Studies are showing less than 80% reduction in transmission, so we may never get there even with 100% vaccine uptake.

So in the end, it's a bit like living in the American south pre-1950.  You may catch malaria.  That may seem OK to some people, but my preference is change the interior environment.

I have had two Pfizer vaccines and am not sure whether to get the Pfizer or Moderna for my booster.

I know that Moderna after Pfizer has been shown to produce a higher amount of neutralizing antibodies.

But I am curious if these are the same antibodies as the Pfizer antibodies?

I know they are generally the same antibodies to the spike protein, but are they identical?

I was thinking in terms of the durability. If I am getting a higher amount initially but not ""nurturing"" the ones I already have, I wonder if I am then losing out on a longer term benefit.

I had a bad reaction to the second shot and want to maximize the booster hoping it will last a long time.

I am wondering if the initial higher antibody count they found after Moderna following Pfizer is just like what would you get if you were vaccine-naive and had only had your first shot of  Moderna vs Pfizer.

The point I assume is to not just increase the neutralizing antibodies in the short term but also to increase the b and t cells.

At the second dose, your body is ready to mount an immune response. But unlike with a natural infection where particles would enter your nose and your body would start to fight them off and there would be a delay before the virus starts replicating, you are being mainlined with the spike protein portion of the virus engineered to release quickly and your body has an immediate immune reaction. The vaccine is getting around a lot of your regular immune defenses, like the mucosa in your nose, for example. The vaccine is going directly into your system and is designed to proliferate and create an immune response.

I would assume that  accounts for the response to the third vaccine, as well.

I also wonder where they are getting the test result data. I doubt it's randomly from the population at large, so are those who are vaccinated more likely to get tested because they are in fact feeling sick, whereas the unvaccinated may be required to be tested regularly by their work (or to get into events etc) due to their vaccine status, resulting in many more negative tests? The age groups that show higher rates among the vaccinated suggest to me it's the workforce that is showing this disparity. And if vaccinated workers are no longer required to mask, or are otherwise exercising more risky behavior, are allowed into larger gatherings, etc then as you suggest that could play a role too. If it's not a random sample of vaccinated / unvaccinated individuals being tested then it's not a good basis for comparison.

Okay so what happens is this
* You have a vaccine that prevents 99.9% of infections. (random number)
* Should you be the 1 in 1000 person to still get infected, you will transmit it to others as normal though.

So to summarize, transmissions are down by 99.9% **but** we still say ""it's not effective against transmissions"" simply because it doesn't so anything to them. In 100% of cases where someone would be able to transmit it before the vaccine, they stilk can. It's only that the frequency of those cases goes down by 99.9%, which of course reduces transmissions by roughly the same amount.

This is also the absurdity of the anti-vax talk right now, even **if** the current vaccines did nothing to transmissions, we are getting infected far less and hence transmissions are naturally down.

It's easy to stop spread when numbers are low, because things like contact tracing are possible. At specific positivity rates testing becomes less useful. 

So stuff like vaccine passports and masking are done later on, yes they make a difference.

However testing takes long for results, contact tracing is harder because there is many more individuals with many more contacts, the dynamics of what close contact means masking or not masking etc etc etc.

Yes it would be effective still, but those policies are 10x more effective at lower case numbers then higher case numbers, and as positivity in testing increases the problem compounds.

Cavuto is of course right and is stating what so many of us have been trying to communicate to others for so long now--and just saying it out loud makes one want to laugh because it's so absurd it shouldn't have to be said to an ostensibly educated, 21st Century population: pandemics and vaccines are a matter of science, not politics. Like many, before we started hearing about the many people refusing to get vaccinated, each with their own (usually quite bizarre) reasons, it never would have occurred to me that such a thing would happen, certainly not in an age of advanced science and technology. My parents remember the Polio epidemic of the early 1950s, the terror people lived in, and how when the Polio vaccine was developed it was taken as something just short of a miracle. People lined up six times around the block to get it. (One of my own relatives contracted Polio and never walked again.) Apart from the AIDS epidemic, which could at least be controlled through abstinence, getting an STD check with a potential sex partner before having sex, and later with the AIDS cocktail drugs, we really haven't had a massive pandemic type event for generations. One of my theories about why some people won't get vaccinated is that we didn't realize how spoiled we were until the pandemic hit. Between modern medical science and modern high-tech infrastructure, we in the First World are not used to events that not only kill large numbers of people, but even threaten to cause a breakdown of the supply chain and other key areas of the economy. We've had it so good for so long that maybe some people just don't or won't believe that anything can threaten their safe, healthy high quality of life.

We don't have much data yet on the residency or robustness of those defenses, but we did just get our first data about b cells and t cells in the vaccinated and everything looks good so far, even when antibodies wane, which likely means you're still fairly protected. The main issues are: we still have only been in this pandemic for about 2 years, so we have less than 2 years data on long term immunity for any category of people, and then there's the issue of our having recommend the second dose too early. Data suggests we should have waited something more like at least 4 months, so this 6 month booster looks to be more analogous to the actual second and final part of a completed immunization. We don't know yet if boosters will be necessary after that because we don't have long term data from the essential completion of vaccinated. The reasoning behind that is the germinal centers, where antibodies go after an infection to kind of report on their efficacy and then educate the immune system so it can develop effective memory bcells and tcells, those germinal centers apparently aren't doing as good a job when you spread the challenges (spike vaccine or altered adenovirus) merely between weeks, instead of at least 4 months apart.

[],,archi1407,,,[],,,,text,t2_5roacr9q,False,False,,"&gt; I am vaccinated. Have been since February. But this is hopium containing almost no evidence. Against Delta, almost all large scale population studies show that the effects of vaccination on populations dissipate extremely rapidly in the months after.

As far as I know, there are only *two* studies looking directly at Delta transmission. The UK preprint,^[[1]](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264260v2) and the Dutch preprint;^[[2]](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.14.21264959v1) Both suggest reduced onward transmission from vaccinated indexes.

There are plenty of data/studies suggesting a quicker viral clearance, shorter infectious window, and lower/less infectious shed virus in cases of breakthrough, though.^[[3]](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.28.21261295v1)  ^[[4]](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.20.21262158v1) Transmission appears (relatively) inefficient. There is also concern testing by PCR (as most studies do) overestimates this.^[[5]](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30868-0) It’s pretty established that Ct count has not been proven to be a good corollary for viral load/infectiousness, and that it’s probably just a measure of viral material in the nasopharynx. Other analyses such as the large ongoing/realtime UK REACT-1 analysis also found a lower viral load(and reduced infections, decent VE) on average among vaccinated persons. It says this is because they sampled the population at random and included any person who tested positive, which makes sense.

You must also consider that vaccination works to prevent infection in the first place. That alone has an effect on reducing spread.

&gt; https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02689-y

&gt; ""Unfortunately, the vaccine’s beneficial effect on Delta transmission waned to almost negligible levels over time. In people infected 2 weeks after receiving the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, both in the UK, the chance that an unvaccinated close contact would test positive was 57%, but 3 months later, that chance rose to 67%. The latter figure is on par with the likelihood that an unvaccinated person will spread the virus.""

This is for AZ which unfortunately appears less effective, especially for protection against infection. It’s been hypothesised that UK’s reliance on AZ for a large part of their population is partially responsible for their high transmission. 

It’s not unexpected though, for vaccinated breakthrough cases, after some waning of VE, to be more transmissible, if not as transmissible as unvaccinated indexes, eventually.

There are also other confounders such as the unvaccinated continuing to gain infection immunity, and hence if they keep using the same methodology, the VE will technically continue to appear to decline towards zero, even if there’s little/no actual decline(which especially significant in a country like the UK). Eyre et al. mentions this as a limitation. They also mention the other limitations in their methodology which may underestimate VE against transmission.

Again, you have to also consider the fact that vaccination works to prevent infection in the first place—as both studies mention.

&gt; UK Covid surveillance for the last 6+ weeks has shown that for many age groups, the double vaccinated crowd had a higher infection rate per 100k people than the unvaccinated (page 13):

This is not true and a recently popular myth. Putting aside the fact that this is raw data with no adjustment for confounders whatsoever, and should be not interpreted at face value(as the document cautions against); They don’t know the number of people in the unvaccinated group(the denominator) and are using population estimates. Here they use NIMS data(which is off by a lot, but there are reasons why it is preferred and used by the NHS); if they use ONS data(also not accurate, but the better available data), it paints a different picture, favouring the vaccinated group, with the unvaccinated group showing double infection rates. See [figure](https://images.theconversation.com/files/420834/original/file-20210913-13-1r7vohq.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=320&amp;h=213&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3) here that shows this. Short [article](https://theconversation.com/amp/covid-19-why-infection-rates-among-double-vaccinated-older-adults-look-worse-than-they-are-167836) explaining the same. Neither is accurate, obviously, which is the reason for the caveat about the denominator in the document.

Hence any raw data that relies are knowing the number of people in the unvaccinated group is unreliable—not that you should be reading into raw data anyways, as mentioned above...That’s why they warn against misinterpretation of this raw data, and point out there is available data(studies, real-world studies/analyses, not raw data) which shows good VE against infection(even 6 months on from 2nd dose, although with some wane in protection). Their most recent REACT-1 analysis PR didn’t look bad either. For some reason people decide to read into these raw surveillance data but not the massive REACT-1 analysis.

&gt; Let's have an honest and open discussion about vaccine efficacy when it comes to transmission. The evidence shows that it cuts hospitalizations and deaths by 50-90%, but it does not really support reduction in transmission.

Hmm, a difference in communication it seems. We have a pandemic here every year. It's the flu pandemic. We usually rise above the threshold required for it to be declared a pandemic (usually around January).

Now, our government thinks, based on the data available to them, that Covid might very well go in that same direction and that it might never go away completely. Our goal was initially to prevent the pandemic but that dream was shattered within days. Since then it was made clear that the goal is to endure the pandemic with an acceptable amount of deaths. The main goal was and is to make sure the health system doesn't collapse so it won't have consequences for other people that require it. Death is inevitable in such an event and we are very lucky that Covid is as tame as it is. Sure, no Covid would be better but it could be much worse as well.

In all of Europe we maybe had and have the least strict mandates and rules. Individual freedom and the rule of law is just as important as the prevention of bodily harm.

The short summary is, there are thousands and thousands of viruses naturally occuring in wildlife and livestock and millions of people in China interact with them each day giving lots of opportunities for viruses to jump over. And we know viruses hop over to humams every day, for example I work on just one strain of flu, and there around 100 human infections from domestic or wild birds every year.


 There is a handful of viruses in one lab at most, and as covid19 shows no sign of editing we are looking at a random escape event. Considering the volume of natural exposures of novel viruses that happen everyday Vs the number in a lab, there's your probability. 

Experts think that oif t was associated with the lab in Wuhan, the infection was most likely a researcher collecting samples in the wild getting infected that way. Again the variety of viruses one can be exposed to in the wild is much higher.

""Unfortunately, the vaccine’s beneficial effect on Delta transmission waned to almost negligible levels over time. In people infected 2 weeks after receiving the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, both in the UK, the chance that an unvaccinated close contact would test positive was 57%, but 3 months later, that chance rose to 67%. The latter figure is on par with the likelihood that an unvaccinated person will spread the virus.""

UK Covid surveillance for the last 6+ weeks has shown that for many age groups, the double vaccinated crowd had a higher infection rate per 100k people than the unvaccinated (page 13):

There is a persistent bias toward higher prevalence and increased severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in males. Underlying mechanisms accounting for this sex difference remain incompletely understood. Interferon responses have been implicated as a modulator of COVID-19 disease in adults, and play a key role in the placental antiviral response. Moreover, the interferon response has been shown to alter Fc receptor expression, and therefore may impact placental antibody transfer. Here we examined the intersection of maternal-fetal antibody transfer, viral-induced placental interferon responses, and fetal sex in pregnant women infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Placental Fc receptor abundance, interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression, and SARS-CoV-2 antibody transfer were interrogated in 68 human pregnancies. Sexually dimorphic expression of placental Fc receptors, ISGs and proteins, and interleukin-10 was observed following maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, with up-regulation of these features in placental tissue of pregnant individuals with male fetuses. Reduced maternal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titers and impaired placental antibody transfer were also observed in pregnancies with a male fetus. These results demonstrate fetal sex-specific maternal and placental adaptive and innate immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.",,,,1635174616,{},hhzrqyc,True,t3_qfiu6a,False,True,t3_qfiu6a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qfiu6a/maternal_sarscov2_infection_elicits_sexually/hhzrqyc/,1635321821.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abstract  
Covid-19 endangers lives, has disrupted normal life, changed the way medicine is practised and is likely to alter our world for the foreseeable future. Twenty months on since the presumptive first diagnosis of COVID-19 in China, more than two hundred million cases have been confirmed and more than four million people have died globally, with the figures rising daily.  
  
One of the most striking aspects of COVID-19 illness is the marked difference in individuals’ experiences of the disease. Some, most often younger groups, are asymptomatic, whereas others become severely ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia or proceed to fatal organ disease. The highest death rates are in the older and oldest age groups and in people with co-morbidities such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity.  
  
Three major questions seem important to consider. What do we understand about changes in the immune system that might contribute to the older person’s risk of developing severe COVID-19? What factors contribute to the higher morbidity and mortality in older people with COVID-19? How could immunocompetence in the older and the frailest individuals and populations be supported and enhanced to give protection from serious COVID-19 illness?

Some in the FDA are completely ignoring the science, or perhaps simply being too technical with their definitions to avoid having to talk about it.  A booster dose is to counter waning immunity; it's very clear immunity wanes after the 2-dose regimen in everyone but it's not clear if young people should care.  A third dose is to give more immunity than the second dose, and it is 100% clear from every study that third doses are overwhelmingly, pandemic-endingly, good.

But the most infuriating thing the FDA - and many other health departments - is doing is not considering the societal benefit, only the individual benefit, to vaccination.  There's no measurable reduction in hospitalization from a booster in under-30s, because there's no measurable amount of hospitalization after the first two doses (or maybe even after the first dose).  But there's actually a higher reduction in infection in that group than in older groups, who also have a 20+ fold reduction in hospitalization.   Acting on individual benefit alone is not how most of us got through the pandemic.  When you prevent an infection (by wearing a mask or getting vaccinated) you on average prevent *two* infections.  The first one is you, but the second one on average is anyone in the population.",,,,1635177136,{},hhzxr4k,False,t3_qfb1yf,False,False,t1_hhzerjk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qfb1yf/daily_discussion_thread_october_25_2021/hhzxr4k/,1635324849.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

\&gt;Moderna also has longer spacing between first and second dose, for example, and that could be an alternate explanation for the difference

The recommended spacing was 3 weeks for Pfizer and 4 weeks for Moderna - one week is likely not going to make a huge difference, but even if it did, many places, including major retail pharmacies like Walgreens, were just scheduling all the mRNA vaccines 4 weeks apart.  I got Pfizer and mine were scheduled 4 weeks apart, just like Moderna.

Now, in the autumn of 2021, I don't think that argument makes sense anymore because there are two extremely robust individual choices anyone can make to avoid getting sick: (1) Get the vaccine, (2) Wear an N95 mask.

If you do both of those, your risk from COVID is basically nil.

Doing whatever you can to stop it from growing, spreading, whatever you want to call it is how we save lives. I went to the movies last night and in California you have ot wear masks and if you purchase food, which will likely mean you take off the masks in the theater, you have to show a vaccination card.

The idea that we should forgo all that and just not bother to protect ourselves is insane. Calling a 5% or 2% or 1% chance of death is absurd. We don't accept this risk in any other activity of daily life.

Take, for example, school activities that we see all over every year. Christmas with Santa. At my local school this is a big event where kids and their families line up for 30-45 to take picutres with santa, enter into raffles to win prizes, buy cookies and other treats, and do a variety of activities.

 \[emphasis mine\]

Again... Source for this?

All I'm finding is that the CDC said that vaccinated people can still transmit the virus, which is true:

[Vaccinated People With Breakthrough Infections Can Spread The Delta Variant, CDC Says](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/07/30/1022867219/cdc-study-provincetown-delta-vaccinated-breakthrough-mask-guidance)  
All I remember seeing in any interview or statement has supported the idea that vaccinated people could still spread the disease (which is true) and thus masks were still needed.  The degree to which vaccines *reduce* the spread was unknown until data started coming in (and continues to do so).  

This was certainly confusing for a variety of factors, including how viral loads were being measured, but the CDC can only report on the data it has.  It would've been entirely counter-productive for them to say, ""vaccines stop any transmission"" when clearly that has been known to be untrue from the beginning.",,,,1635115163,{},hhx38ks,False,t3_qevew6,False,True,t1_hhwz0mj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qevew6/vaccinated_people_may_be_even_less_likely_to/hhx38ks/,1635268676.0,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If there was a 100% vaccination rate, the cases would plummet and deaths would all but disappear. That sentence doesn't mean there would be 0, it means there would be way, way, way fewer. A lot of families who lost someone wouldn't have lost someone. There would be so many fewer cases and deaths that it wouldn't be a serious public health issue anymore. And there would be more beds in hospitals available to give everyone who needs it the best available treatment. And more beds for people who need them for reasons other than Covid.

No vaccine is 100% effective. That's exactly the reason it's important for everyone who can to get vaccinated. That's how vaccines work. That's why you never got smallpox. Because people didn't used to be such entitled brats about public health.

Not even the majority? Why don't you look up some statistics on that. Yes, the majority of deaths at this point are unvaccinated people. The ones who are vaccinated and still get covid, at this point, most likely got it from someone who is unvaccinated.

And deaths are also not the only problem. Many times more people end up with long term health problems after contracting covid. Many lives ruined.

Besides, even if it was only 10 people in total (the real number is likely several factors of 10 more than that) who died because of people who refuse to get a vaccine for no legitimate reason, that's 10 people who were killed directly because of antivaxxers.

&gt;She had five job offers even before she was formally fired, two of them from hospitals that had not yet mandated the vaccine.   

Would you want to be sick and have no choice but to go to a hospital full of unvaccinated nurses?    

**Get vaccinated.** Protect yourself, your family, your coworkers, and your community by greatly decreasing the likelihood of becoming severely ill and passing the virus on to others. This is the stupidest fucking shit I have witnessed in my lifetime. No one complained about getting vaccinated before going to kindergarten, joining the police force, or becoming a healthcare worker. There's literally people out there protesting a vaccine who have already provided proof of vaccination to acquire employment. Now that you have an extremist political party supporting your delusions, you've lost any ability to think critically.   

Who in their right mind would choose to lose their job and put themselves and their family at any risk at all for the sake of saving a trip to get a potentially life saving shot of medicine?

In it, regulators who were in charge of the decision said they remain skeptical of boosters. Basically the tone of the article is that boosters make people feel better psychologically but has nominal benefits for most people. 

There was also [this article from The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/09/when-you-should-get-your-covid-booster-shot/620123/) about a month ago which is best summarized by this line: “‘I think it’s important to not just say, Should I get a booster or not?’ Dowdy said, ‘but rather, Would I prefer to have a booster now or save the opportunity for later?’”

From the beginning I’ve been guided by science. I got the vaccine as soon as I could because the evidence is overwhelming in favor of it being effective.

i dont even have words for this... First off, its a full time construction job and they were saying they were only going to pay $10/hr?! thats pathetic. then it gets even worse with them saying they were actually going to start him at $8.65/hr despite their state's minimum wage being at $10/hr as of last month?! yeah, no wonder they're not getting worthwhile employees.

this example is perfect to everyones that's complaining about ""no one wants to work"", ""oh no, stimulus checks are over, time to not be lazy anymore and go back to work"" (which we only had 3 stimulus checks and for majority of the population, those checks dont even cover a month's worth of bills), ""we can't find anyone to fill these positions!""

i am more than willing to bet that majority of the places that cant find worthwhile employees, the positions they're offering are either terrible in pay/benefits, or the overall position itself is terrible and not worth working. When a lot of restaurants, fast food places, retail, and all other basic service type jobs are offering anywhere from $12-15/hr now, why would you apply to a place where you'd have to work tougher positions or possibly a crazy amount of hours for not much more pay? yeah, i wouldnt either.",,,,1635168610,{},hhzejva,False,t3_qet8xp,False,False,t1_hhy3uph,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qet8xp/thousands_of_workers_across_the_us_would_rather/hhzejva/,1635315077.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DENVER (KDVR) — The Denver Zoo announced Monday that 11 African lions, ranging in age from 1-9, tested positive for COVID-19.  
The zoo said animal care and veterinarians describe the symptoms as being relatively mild at this point, and they are closely monitoring and treating the lions individually as needed.  
Zoo keepers noticed the lions were coughing, sneezing, acting lethargic and battling nasal discharge. The lions tested positive after nasal swab samples were sent to Colorado State University’s Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. The positive cases were confirmed by the US Department of Agriculture’s Veterinary Services Laboratories, the Denver Zoo said on Monday.  
“There have been a number of big cats to come down with COVID-19 at zoos throughout the country, including our two tigers, Yuri and Nikita,” said Brian Aucone, Senior Vice President for Life Sciences for the Zoo. “Fortunately, the vast majority have fully recovered, and the upside is that there’s an established knowledge base for us to draw from to help treat our animals. We’ve been in touch with other zoos that have also recently managed COVID cases in their big cats to inform the care we’re providing.”  
Earlier this month, two of Denver Zoo’s Amur tigers tested positive for COVID-19. The zoo said the African lions started showing symptoms after the tigers tested positive. It is unclear if the two groups of positive cases are connected.  
The zoo said the animal care staff adheres to strict COVID-19 protocols around our animals, including required use of personal protective equipment, hygiene, cleaning, employee self-screening, and health management.  
None of the lions were vaccinated against COVID-19, according to the zoo.  
“Our veterinarians are planning to vaccinate them along with the tigers as soon as more doses of the animal-specific Zoetis vaccine become available,” shared the zoo.",,,,1635190802,{},hi0vef3,True,t3_qfokly,False,False,t3_qfokly,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qfokly/11_african_lions_test_positive_for_covid19_at/hi0vef3/,1635342887.0,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Nasdaq: MRNA), a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines, today announced positive interim data from the Phase 2/3 study, called the KidCOVE study, of mRNA-1273, the Company’s vaccine candidate against COVID-19, in children 6 to under 12 years of age. This interim analysis showed a robust neutralizing antibody response after two doses of mRNA-1273 at the 50 µg dose level with a favorable safety profile. Moderna plans to submit these data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other global regulators in the near term.  
  
“We are encouraged by the immunogenicity and safety profile of mRNA-1273 in children aged 6 to under 12 years and are pleased that the study met its primary immunogenicity endpoints,” said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. “We look forward to filing with regulators globally and remain committed to doing our part to help end the COVID-19 pandemic with a vaccine for adults and children of all ages.”  
  
KidCOVE is a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, reactogenicity and effectiveness of two 50 µg doses of mRNA-1273 given to healthy children 28 days apart. The study population is divided into 3 age groups (6 to &lt;12 years, 2 to &lt;6 years, and 6 months to &lt;2 years). Today Moderna reports on the 6 to under 12 years of age cohort.  
  
This cohort enrolled 4,753 participants who were 6 to less than 12 years of age. In the trial, the SARS-Cov-2-neutralizing antibody geometric mean ratio (GMR) comparing the response in children to the response in young adults from the Phase 3 COVE study was 1.5 (95% Cl: 1.3, 1.8), with a seroresponse rate of 99.3%, representing a difference of 0.6% (95% CI: -2.8%, 2.8%) to the Phase 3 benchmark. These results demonstrate strong immune response in this cohort of children one month after the second dose and met the co-primary immunogenicity endpoints for 6 to less than 12 years olds in KidCOVE.  
  
mRNA-1273 was generally well tolerated with a safety and tolerability profile generally consistent with the Phase 3 COVE study in adolescents and adults. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. The most common solicited adverse events were fatigue, headache, fever, and injection site pain.",,,,1635175392,{},hhztjwy,True,t3_qfj34d,False,True,t3_qfj34d,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qfj34d/moderna_announces_positive_top_line_data_from/hhztjwy/,1635322745.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,whitebeard250,,,[],,,,text,t2_mrz49,False,False,[],"True, I was expecting some new research since the title kinda implied this. But some existing data/analyses I replied previously to someone else:

&gt; There are plenty of data/studies suggesting a quicker viral clearance, shorter infectious window, and lower/less infectious shed virus in cases of breakthrough.^[[1]](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.28.21261295v1)  ^[[2]](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.20.21262158v1) Transmission appears (relatively) inefficient. There is also concern testing by PCR (as most studies do) overestimates this.^[[3]](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30868-0) It’s pretty established that Ct count has not been proven to be a good corollary for viral load/infectiousness, and that it’s probably just a measure of viral material in the nasopharynx. Other analyses such as the large ongoing/realtime UK REACT-1 analysis also found a lower viral load(and reduced infections, decent VE) on average among vaccinated persons. It says this is because they sampled the population at random and included any person who tested positive, which makes sense.

&gt; As far as I know, there are only two studies looking directly at Delta transmission, and they were only uploaded recently on preprint server. The UK preprint,^[[4]](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264260v2) and the Dutch preprint;^[[5]](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.14.21264959v1) Both suggest reduced onward transmission from vaccinated indexes.

&gt; We must also consider the fact that vaccination works to prevent infection in the first place—as both studies mention. That alone has an effect on reducing spread.

&gt; There are also other confounders such as the unvaccinated continuing to gain infection immunity, and hence if they keep using the same methodology, the VE will technically continue to appear to decline towards zero, even if there’s little/no actual decline(which especially significant in a country like the UK). Eyre et al. mentions this as a limitation of their study. They also mention the other limitations in their methodology which may underestimate VE against transmission.

&gt; Overall it appears to me that the data does support a non-trivial reduction in transmission.",,,,1635164104,{},hhz6cb1,False,t3_qevew6,False,True,t1_hhx83qi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qevew6/vaccinated_people_may_be_even_less_likely_to/hhz6cb1/,1635310843.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We had opportunity to do an in-between when spread was slower when Delta didn't exist, but now we know this is highly contagious, a few days ago a study was released on a Navy ship that had 100% sequenced Delta Variant of Concern, it spread to infect 90% of the entire ship in just 25 days. Now you might think, well, that's a ship, and you'd be correct, it is a ship, but winter is coming, we haven't mass adapted hvac systems to scrub the air of viral particles, so you're going to have little wood and brick ships packed with humans, aka homes and offices, for months.
