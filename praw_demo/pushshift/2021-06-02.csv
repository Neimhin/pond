To start, nightlife was in full swing this entire time in Houston - clubs/bars reopened officially in early fall and packed, almost pre-pandemic level partying was ongoing from Winter 2020. Masking was very limited in these venues. We're talking dozens upon dozens of super spreader events occurring each and every individual Wednesday, Thursday, friday, Saturday and Sunday (and some Tuesdays - thanks to Industry nights!) for months on end in the heart of the 3rd wave.

Masking in businesses had always been relatively higher, but this too varied, and when the governor's mandate dropped in March that variation grew. Anti-mask sentiment in Texas is very strong and anti-maskers quite numerous, so that was a green light for many. 

I won't even get into the many private parties/pregames/post-games. 

All of these social gatherings were far less frequent in places like NY or MA.

I was living in Downtown Houston, going to mostly normal spots a Houstonian would go to. I do know that Austin was significantly more shut down in 2020 than Houston (although it too roared back to life once the governor dropped the state mandate in March).

TL;DR: Texas has largely controlled the pandemic, but my anecdotal experience would indicate that this success was not linked to high compliance with CDC guidelines re: masking and other mitigation measures. Indeed, Texans have been moving in quite the opposite direction this entire time. They've done the bare minimum (masking up in Walmart or Costco most of the time), but pretty much nothing else (many more social gatherings indoors and maskless, less distancing, etc).",,,1622704751,{},h0evynf,False,t3_noh1ew,False,True,t1_h02tri8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/noh1ew/record_low_071_7day_average_positivity_rate_in_ny/h0evynf/,1622828786,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Third point: the tens of thousands of people reaped what they sowed due to government incompetence, how is that their fault? Why would they be offered no condolences or sympathy due to their government when comparable countries were? Which there were. Italy were incompetent many times over later in the pandemic when Britain got its shit together more.


There's also the fact that this mindset prevailed well into the second and third wave. Those waves happened in a time of mass testing, one of the highest in the world, and local lockdowns etc. That wasn't down to purely incompetence but because of a new, little understood variant. How is that not comparable? A variant that the UK found, amongst others, because pretty much no other western country can be bothered to sequence them.

My entire point was that I have a feeling this could have been done in a more efficient way than it is being handled. By this I mean, figuring out a longer term solution rather than sending out unused doses as an olive branch to the rest of the world.

 The fact that nearly half of the entire population of the US, UK are fully vaccinated, and the entire rest of the world has yet to cross 10% shows the disparity in distribution of vaccines and the lack of cooperation on our end as the ""economic leader"" in this world.

As the world’s less affluent countries scramble for COVID-19 vaccine and contend with deadly surges of the disease, researchers in South Africa have just documented an ominous development: the collision of the pandemic with HIV/AIDS.

Geneticists and infectious disease specialists there have uncovered potentially dangerous coronavirus mutations in a 36-year-old woman with uncontrolled HIV who was unable to shake the SARS-CoV-2 virus for close to eight months. The driving force behind the patient’s rapid accumulation of genetic changes is probably her impaired immune response due to her unsuccessfully treated HIV, the researchers said.
The case highlights a difficult truth: that affluent nations racing to vaccinate their own populations will remain vulnerable as long as the coronavirus is spreading and mutating in low- and middle-income countries, where lack of vaccine has kept COVID-19 immunization rates low. That’s especially true in countries like South Africa, where HIV infections are common but often undetected.

“This underscores the advantage that this virus has until we can put the brakes on it, and we have to put the brakes on it globally,” said Dr. Bruce Walker, founding director of the Ragon Institute, an immunology research center in Boston.


While the South African patient was diagnosed with HIV back in 2006, doctors had been unable to control her viral load with standard antiretroviral therapy, and her immune system’s population of CD4+ T cells — which may play a role in clearing coronavirus infection — were very low.
For 216 days, the woman continued to test positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. She was hospitalized with moderate illness for nine days in September soon after she contracted the coronavirus, but she never became severely ill with COVID-19.
Still, the coronavirus that lingered in her body underwent 13 genetic changes related to its crucial spike protein, along with at least 19 other genetic shifts elsewhere that could change the behavior of the virus.

The new findings raise the specter that HIV/AIDS — a 40-year-old scourge that has killed 32 million worldwide — could complicate efforts to eradicate a COVID-19 pandemic that has killed more than 3.5 million in less than a year and a half.
Until the South African patient, there has been little evidence to suggest that HIV-infected people could complicate the pandemic’s trajectory. HIV-positive people were not known to be more likely to become infected with the coronavirus. And research had suggested they did not suffer worse medical consequences of COVID-19.
But if her case turns out to be typical, that picture could change: HIV patients whose infections are not controlled with medication could “become a factory of variants for the whole world,” said Tulio de Oliveira, a geneticist at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, who led the new research.

Worldwide, roughly 8 million people are thought to be infected with HIV but unaware of their status. An additional 1.7 million are on antiretroviral medications that aren’t working well.
The prospect that close to 10 million patients’ uncontrolled HIV could spawn new coronavirus variants has wide-ranging implications.

1. There's a weird ideological alignment between conservatives and rejecting covid measures including vaccines. The UK doesn't have the same thing, we have dedicated anti-vaxxers and anti-lockdowners, but they are a very small movement


2. I think offering vaccines by age group very tightly helped with uptake. In Scotland people got sent letters with their appointment so most people probably wanted to get it when they had the chance, whereas with an open systempeoole might delay booking.

3. People travel internationally in the UK than in the US and I think the thought that they may need to be fully vaccinated to travel was a good incentive. It takes up to 15 weeks from first dose to being fully vaccinated here, so it's too late to get vaccinated last minute when you decide you want to go on holiday.

4. Lockdowns have been harder in the UK than in many US states. We went through a 3 month complete lockdown in 2020 than a four month complete lockdown in 2021 with partial lockdowns in between. By comparison things seemed to be pretty free in states like Florida.

I only get the level of protection that the vaccine I get gives. None of these vaccines protects everybody that gets vaccinated. Pfizer may give over 90% protection - while AstraZeneca reduction in disease transmission may be as low as 67%.

Certainly we need to attain herd immunity - and as we do not know how many people have become immune through previous undetected infections, we cannot know how many people we need to vaccinate in order to achieve the magic number of immune people that will give us herd immunity.

Certainly I am better off having been vaccinated, but it is not a guarantee that I will not become infected, or pass that infection on to others. Possibly to others who are unable to get vaccinated themselves because of previous medical conditions.

&gt;They may be leery of the mRNA technology

Everyone is 'leery' of the technology, everyone knows there is a risk when you get vaccinated. That is not an excuse for refusing a vaccination. It is a form of cowardice - and demonstrated selfish behavior, of people that think they can get a free pass, while the rest can take the risk of being vaccinated.

I make sure my masks fit as tight to my face (I have facial hair) as I can get them. Throughout the pandemic I have taken every precaution and have had to defend my position almost daily from the constant peer pressure to “be normal” and “not let covid fear rule my life”. 

At one point, I was being tested every week because of verified exposures and just before my first vaccine shot I had an antibody test done. From all the evidence I have, I never got covid (and neither did my family). Which, in a twisted way, people use as “evidence” that covid isn’t easy to get and the media hyped it up - while ignoring how many people died or have long term effects from it. I still have a handful of people in my office that are not vaccinated and (to my knowledge) not had it but also refuse to get the vaccine. 

My co-worker is walking around proud he got it at this point. He talks about how he lost his smell/taste and was “a little stuffy” but was still lifting 400+lbs at the gym (he also went to the gym while sick). He keeps talking about how it “wasn’t a big deal” and he “doesn’t understand what all the fuss” was about.

He even made a comment about me wearing my mask yesterday, telling me that I didn’t have to wear a mask around him anymore since he is now immune (taking the opportunity to tell me, yet again, that he’s had it and it isn’t as bad as “they” say). My response was “look, I know you’re a young pup and you were lucky. But, frankly, it’s people like you that are keeping me in a mask. Since you were nice enough to come to work sick and expose me, that’s proof enough to keep taking precautions because of the selfish people of this state who have no regard for human life or even an ounce of decency for their fellow man. I’ll wear my mask until I’m damn good and ready not to.” There was a little more tit for tat, but I basically made my position clear.",,,1622719177,{},h0fcu3u,False,t3_nr16jb,False,False,t1_h0epxlz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nr16jb/about_500_people_in_colorado_are_still/h0fcu3u/,1622839986,31,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It absolutely does. You can’t just unanimously say masks are not uncomfortable and expect people to take it as the objective truth. Especially when they have there own subjective opinions from there own experience. For one it doesn’t convince anyone who disagrees with you, and two you are asking them to disprove your subjective opinion which is just as impossible as telling someone there subjective opinion is wrong.

46.5% of all adults (18+) have received at least one shot, and 19.5% of all adults are fully vaccinated. In terms of full population (Sweden has 10.38m inhabitants), the percentages are approx. 36.7% for first shots and 15.4% full vaccinations. A total of 5 400 436 doses have been administered, i.e. 52 per 100 pop.

Currently most (new) vaccinations are made with either Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna. AstraZeneca is reserved for 65+ and that age group has pretty much finished vaccinations save for the second doses. J&amp;J is paused indefinitely and will likely never be used. Excess doses are AFAIK being donated to COVAX.

Most of Sweden's 21 regions are currently vaccinating 50+ or around that age, together with 18+ with comorbities and medical staff. The nationwide age distribution is currently

Age | First dose coverage | Full vaccination
---|---|----
18-29 | 9.88% | 3.87%
30-39 | 12.56% | 5.06%
40-49 | 22.67% | 6.4%
50-59 | 57.33% | 8.69%
60-69 | 85.19% | 18.95%
70-79 | 91.94% | 51.64%
80-89 | 93.08% | 84.66%
90+ | 90.55% | 83.84%

The national goal is that all adults should have been offered a first dose by Sep 5. The past 7 days a total of 489 629 doses have been administered, which is an average of 69 947 per day. Adjusted to US population this corresponds to 2.2m doses/day.

Around 650k doses of Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna were delivered this week. A bit more than 16m doses is required to fully vaccinate all adults, i.e. around 11m additional doses are needed for that.

Who's ""fawning""?

&gt;They are giving a false sense of confidence to the population when really they are only borderline effective after two doses (50% protection from symptoms, 70% protection from hospitalization and death) and useless after one (literally, Coronovac is only estimated to be 3% effective after one dose).
&gt;
&gt;And those efficacy numbers are before considering vaccine evasion from some strains that may push that down even further.

[This new study](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/npnv2y/immunization_of_serranas_population_with/) from Brasil - so with one of the worst variants widespread - shows a ""reduction of 80% of the symptomatic cases and 95% of deaths after the second vaccination of the last group of the city"". It does clearly work well enough, as long as enough people get fully vaccinated.

Yes, clearly the more modern vaccines are better. But there simply isn't enough of them in the world for everyone.

&gt; A needle-free COVID-19 vaccination has passed pre-clinical trials, with its developers excited by the possibility of a painless, easy-to-use patch that could roll out in future waves of coronavirus vaccination.

&gt; Australian company Vaxxas, which was spun out of the University of Queensland to develop the technology, has been working with the University of Texas Hexapro vaccine candidate for the study.

&gt; UQ’s David Muller, who has been running the pre-clinical trials, said they had seen excellent results in their mouse models, even better than the results from the same vaccine administered via needle and syringe.

&gt; The patch has thousands of tiny “microprojections” or mini-needles on its surface that are coated in the vaccine.

&gt; Dr Muller said those delivered the vaccine to a specific layer of the skin that prompted a more immediate and robust immune response compared with tradition vaccinations.

&gt; Unlike needles, the patches do not hurt, and because they are single-use there is no risk of cross-contamination.

That was my 2020.  Watching someone die pretty much every month or so.  Stood at the side of many graves.  Went to a few virtual funerals.  Some didn't even have services due to covid.  Most were covid.  One was cancer.  One was various other medical issues.  Scattered amongst all those people dying were phone calls I got from panicked friends telling their husband/wife/mom/dad/grandma/grandpa was in the hospital and they didn't think they were going to make it.  My dad (who I am estranged from and haven't spoken to in 5-6 yrs) called me one night and told me my mom (who I knew was sick) probably wasn't going to make it and that I should prepare myself.  All of these people ended up making it including my mother but I had no idea that was going to be the case as I got the same call about other people who didn't.  You lift all covid restrictions back in March and do nothing and I could've ended up on the side of 20 different graves instead of 10.  Is that better at all?  

And I'll say again that the year is entirely what you make of it because life is entirely what you make of it.  I turned 40 in 2020.  I had a big birthday bash planned at Disneyworld for my family/friends.  Instead I did nothing.  Did that suck?  Yes.  But you make the most of what you have.

The way COVAX has been set up is rich countries pool in money together for bulk contract deals with pharmaceutical companies at a 2:1 ratio for what they get to keep. For every $2 spent rich nations get $1 in vaccines. The other $1 goes to poor countries, so it's a way for rich nations to get something out of it but also donate something in return to poor nations.

COVAX has delivered a decent amount of vaccines so far to poor countries so Canada is making an impact. 

The criticism being made here is about Canada receiving that $1 out of $2 spent it's entitled to under the COVAX system. Those criticizing are stating that they believe Canada should instead be giving out the full amount it paid into COVAX and have all of the vaccines go to poor nations instead of 50% which is how the COVAX system is intended to work.

This is a fair criticism. Canada has been able to receive a very large amount of vaccines from unilateral bulk contract deals it has made with pharmaceutical companies. It has a high vaccine rate compared to the world average, so the criticism being made is it's not doing enough. I would agree with that. I think Canada should be donating more at this point.

Take a look at this plot of seasonal flu vs rhinovirus:https://twitter.com/InfectiousDz/status/1333615011634294790

Isn't it weird that [rhinovirus which has been pretty clearly shown to be spread by fomites is still running rampant](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/116/5/828/111471), but flu is virtually nonexistent in the wake of COVID prevention controls?

Or you can look at this recent experimental study where they purposely infected participants with the flu and these ""donors"" failed to infect almost anyone in a well ventilated environment compared to their pilot study with poor ventilation.

&gt;Uncertainty about the importance of influenza transmission by airborne droplet nuclei generates controversy for infection control. Human challenge-transmission studies have been supported as the most promising approach to fill this knowledge gap. Healthy, seronegative volunteer ‘Donors’ (n = 52) were randomly selected for intranasal challenge with influenza A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2). ‘Recipients’ randomized to Intervention (IR, n = 40) or Control (CR, n = 35) groups were exposed to Donors for four days. IRs wore face shields and hand sanitized frequently to limit large droplet and contact transmission. One transmitted infection was confirmed by serology in a CR, yielding a secondary attack rate of 2.9% among CR, 0% in IR (p = 0.47 for group difference), and 1.3% overall, significantly less than 16% (p&lt;0.001) expected based on a proof-of-concept study secondary attack rate and considering that there were twice as many Donors and days of exposure. **The main difference between these studies was mechanical building ventilation in the follow-on study, suggesting a possible role for aerosols.**

Coronavirus And influenzas are literally entirely different families of viruses.  The symptoms that they mirror are because they are viruses that infect the lungs. 

Of course anyone can have the same outcomes. 

The coronavirus vaccine efforts began a long time ago  on the original SARS and MERS. All the research had already been done. It was a minor tweak to make it into COVID because it’s not really significantly different. That’s also why it’s so important to vaccinate now, because the more people that are vaccinated, the fewer people can get infected. Fewer infectable hosts means less spread, less spread means lower chance of mutation, lower chance of mutation means we don’t do this whole dance again in another 5 years.

""Not clear to me why boosters are needed. So far most of the vaccines appear to prevent severe disease with all the variants. Infection is not prevented, only moderate to severe disease. That is how most human vaccines work. I think there is a tendency to extrapolate from influenza virus where a decrease in antibody neutralization titer against current strains triggers reformulation of the vaccine. But SARS-CoV-2 is not influenza virus. I think we need to observe how vaccinated people respond to infection and keep track of disease severity. If it seems like more severe disease is occurring in vaccinated people, then we might change the vaccine. But remember that T cells protect against severe disease and their epitopes do not change in the variants.""

""Those studies were done shortly after vaccination when antibody levels are very high. In a year the serum and mucosal antibody levels will be very low and will not prevent infection. However the memory response will kick in in 2-3 days and prevent extensive replication, shedding, and disease.""

""The benefit of the inactivated vaccines is that they contain other viral proteins, not just spike. Those other viral proteins have T cell epitopes which can only be beneficial and help prevent disease. The need for booster probably comes from not having enough inactivated virus, or it not generating a good memory response.""

My mother is much happier (and safer!) Now that she's vaccinated.

That’s magnitudes away from building, staffing, and running a lab to make mRNA vaccines.

So we are talking years and years just to build the facilities, think about that, even if the patent were released the lab wouldn’t be build for years, well after the pandemic is over.

If they wanted to help, they’d make the precursors, those are largely free from patent and in short supply (proving that patents alone do not hinder development, people cant just make anything at the drop of a hat).

Could have done better? They rolled out two effective vaccines in a calendar year that are safer and more effective than anything else developed anywhere.

Yes there were delays in scale, we were supposed to have 100m doses by the end of 2020, it took much longer to get there.

If the guys who have been living and breathing mRNA vaccines for a decade had issues getting the plants they designed up to full capacity with the US government using the DPA to source rare supplies, do you really think any scientist in a country with no notable native vaccine production could possibly get production of a cutting edge vaccine done in a reasonable amount of time with just the patent information on the vaccine itself.

Just think about that.

A highly complex biotechnology and you think that some completely inexperienced scientists who aren’t native English speakers could effectively develop a way to make the vaccine and it’s lipid delivery system while there’s a global shortage of materials.

And those efficacy numbers are before considering vaccine evasion from some strains that may push that down even further.

Very true.

However, the majority of the misinformation is targeted, with the aim of causing more deaths.  I'll just ignore anything coming from a layperson that implies that people shouldn't get vaccinated as soon as possible.  Up until recently, I'd also ignore anything arguing that safety measures were unnecessary.

So that's part of it, but the other part is that propaganda, while effective, is not usually entirely subtle.  Propaganda victims often use what I call ""cargo cult arguments,"" where they parrot phrases they've heard in other contexts without really understanding what they're saying.

For example, a week or two ago, you'd see people coming out of the woodwork saying ""trust the science"" in an effort to get people to stop wearing masks.  This meets both of my conditions.  It seems to be oddly aggressive about a common safety measure, and it uses a particular set phrase that has turned into a bit of a shibboleth.

I guess that's a third thing.  People all of a sudden repeating the same message, even if it's something that doesn't quite make sense.  My favorite recent example of this is people saying that wearing a mask until cases drop somehow implies a lack of belief that vaccines work.  It's a bit of a two-fer in that it allows the propaganda victim to attack masks while also managing to sneak in a negative comment about vaccines.",,,1622724262,{},h0flcc1,False,t3_nqzldd,False,True,t1_h0ebvux,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nqzldd/97_of_covid19_cases_in_king_county_are_among/h0flcc1/,1622845562,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

A longer answer is that although the situation is much much better right now in the US than elsewhere in the world, it is NOT due to the covid being weaker than the flu. It is due to the relatively widespread vaccines and, more importantly, it is due to the many sacrifices healthcare workers and parents have made so far.

The risk calculation differs family to family. But there are still many parents in the US who don't want to take risks with their unvaccinated children. It is just untrue that ""children aren't at risk for covid"" or ""the flu is literally more deadly than covid for young children"" 

There was also an article in Lancet saying that ""Our results demonstrate that relaxing social distancing measures for vaccinated individuals would have minimal impact on incidence, but extending such guidelines to other individuals before adequate vaccination of children could fuel a rapid rise in COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations, and deaths.""

What they are probably referring to is the Oral Polio Vaccine, which hasn't been used in the US for 20+ years.

&gt;A vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is a strain of the weakened poliovirus that was initially included in oral polio vaccine (OPV) and that has changed over time and behaves more like the wild or naturally occurring virus. This means it can be spread more easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a sneeze, of an infected person. These viruses may cause illness, including paralysis.

&gt;For this reason, the global eradication of polio requires stopping all OPV in routine immunization, as soon as possible after the eradication of wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission.  To protect against all three types of WPV, the United States exclusively has used IPV since 2000. For more information on OPV cessation, please visit the Global Polio Eradication Initiative’s websiteexternal icon.

Basically the oral vaccine had a weak version of the virus that mutated and can spread to unvaccinated people.

&gt; The occurrence of iVDPVs is very rare. Only 111 cases have been documented worldwide since 1962.

It hasn't harmed anywhere near the 350,000 who contracted real polio, which was the last peak in 1988.  Yearly we're down to about ~35.  Even it it were only 35 every year since 1962, that's still 2065 cases of real polio versus 111 of VDPV.",,,1622718547,{},h0fby0g,False,t3_nqzldd,False,False,t1_h0fabu1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nqzldd/97_of_covid19_cases_in_king_county_are_among/h0fby0g/,1622839395,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Taipei, June 3 (CNA) Health and Welfare Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said Thursday said that Taiwan seems headed for a new peak in COVID-19 cases, as 585 new infections and 17 deaths from the disease were reported earlier in the day.

Of the 585 cases, 583 were classified as domestic infections -- with 364 newly confirmed and 219 reported from a backlog of test results over the past two weeks.

While the total number of cases on Thursday was slightly lower than the previous day, it was higher than on Tuesday, Chen noted at a Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) press briefing.


The latest numbers are ""not a good sign,"" he said, adding that it will be become clearer in a few days whether Taiwan is approaching a new peak.

Meanwhile, the percentage of COVID-19 patients in the 20-39 age group has climbed from 19.9 percent to 25.2 percent in the past two days, Chen said, cautioning young people in particular, and everyone else, to continue to follow the CECC's disease prevention regulations.

He said young people may be letting their guard down because of a decline in the number of cases reported last week.

However, ""we cannot afford to be overly optimistic now,"" he said.

CECC data on Thursday showed that New Taipei and Taipei remained the two main COVID-19 hotspots, reporting 265 and 224 domestic cases, respectively.
Miaoli County reported 34, Taoyuan 30, Changhua County 15, Taichung five, and Keelung four.

Tainan confirmed two cases, while one each was reported in Hsinchu and Kaohsiung cities and Hualien and Yilan counties.

Of the 583 total domestic cases, 14 had unknown sources of infection, and three were under investigation, the CECC said.

The two imported COVID-19 cases reported Thursday involved Indonesian and Vietnamese nationals who came to Taiwan to work, according to the CECC.

The 17 fatalities were 13 men and four women, aged 40-100, who passed away between May 28 and June 1, the data showed.

Taiwan has confirmed a total of 9,974 COVID-19 cases, 8,500 of which are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded more than 100 cases in a single day.
The number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths in the country has risen to 166, including 154 recorded since May 15, CECC data shows.

Prof Gupta told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK was already in a third wave of infections and at least **three quarters of cases were the variant identified in India.**  
He said: ""Of course the numbers of cases are relatively low at the moment - all waves start with low numbers of cases that grumble in the background and then become explosive, so the key here is that what we are seeing here is the signs of an early wave.""  
However, he said the number of people who had been vaccinated in the UK meant **this wave would probably take longer to emerge than previous ones.**  
**""There may be a false sense of security for some time, and that's our concern.""**

But Prof Gupta - a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) - **said ending restrictions in June should be delayed ""by a few weeks whilst we gather more intelligence"".**

All people with rather intimate knowledge I trust more than the evening news. Mind you my ""keyboard warring"" was getting KN95 and other respirator-type masks in the hands of people working with the public well over a year before the CDC/WHO accepted the clear science that aerosol spread was a major factor.

We don't need lockdowns for the rest of our lives. They are only a temporary tool of last resort to get the community spread to zero. Better monitoring can allow them to be smaller and targeted to specific regions too. After that, the quarantine of incoming people is the tough part that needs to be maintained until more of the world is vaccinated. Several countries have been able to live pretty close to normal over the last year with such strategies in place including Taiwan which had a stretch of 8 months with 0 local cases. It is a lot of work at the forefront but it allows much more life with normalcy while saving lives and keeping transmission low to slow the mutations that can set us back.

Elimination over mitigation is also better overall for the economy and civil rights which are ironically the excuses often used to water down restrictions and open too early. We need to accept we've been shortsighted when looking at the bigger picture that includes working examples we can build from.  


&gt;The trade-off between different objectives is at the heart of political decision making. Public health, economic growth, democratic solidarity, and civil liberties are important factors when evaluating pandemic responses. There is mounting evidence that these objectives do not need to be in conflict in the COVID-19 response. Countries that consistently aim for elimination—ie, maximum action to control SARS-CoV-2 and stop community transmission as quickly as possible—have generally fared better than countries that opt for mitigation—ie, action increased in a stepwise, targeted way to reduce cases so as not to overwhelm health-care systems.

If, for some reason, we did see numbers of that nature, I would expect pullback or pause on Pfizer to determine if there is a causal link and a serious risk of illness or death in children. 

And it's not like every kid should get them. There are legit contraindications. I guess I don't see any reason they shouldn't be allowed to if they've asked their pediatrician about it. I still think from a public health standpoint the risk to reward ratio of reduced transmission and reducing their albeit small chances of COVID while also allowing them the ability to participate in activities they would otherwise be prohibited from or masked for is worth it. Of course, the last component is non medical, but has to be worth considering for kids who that may be a barrier to (sports, school, camps, family, etc)

Fine.  How many virtual bar crawls did you set up with them?

[],,girlwriteswhat,,,[],,,,text,t2_50vh1,False,False,[],"Sure. But if YOU get vaccinated, you're protected, and everyone around you is protected from you. 

People may have their own reasons for not getting vaccinated. They may have had vaccine injuries in the past (they're rare, but more common than most people think). They may have already had the virus and recovered, and have natural acquired immunity. They may be leery of the mRNA technology (Pfizer, Moderna), which has never been deployed on this scale before and has, at best, a 20 year track record of human trials. They may be concerned about the blood clot issue with AstraZeneca, especially if they have a vascular condition. And we know that some people, because of their specific health issues, either should not be vaccinated, or if they do get vaccinated won't be helped by it.

As someone who's been infected and recovered, I don't think I should be pressured into getting an unnecessary shot. And frankly, while vaccines are still in short supply, I'm not going to take one away from someone who needs it when I do not. 

And we also need to consider that many people were infected and recovered without knowing it because they were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms. They will also now be immune. 

Herd immunity is not about how many people have been vaccinated. It's about how many people are immune. Of myself, my husband and my 3 kids, only one was tested, but we've all had it. My nephew lost his sense of taste and smell for 3 weeks early last spring before the lockdowns. His mother (who is a doctor) is 99% sure he had COVID, but because he didn't have severe respiratory symptoms and wasn't a health worker, he didn't qualify for a test at the time.

This means more people have had it than have tested positive for it.

It's entirely possible that herd immunity can be achieved with a 50% vaccination rate. In my extended family alone, there are 5 people who've had COVID but were never tested, and one who had a positive test.

If 34 million people in the US have tested positive, based on my family's experience, there could be as many as 170 million people who've had it and are now immune. I suspect a lot of people who are getting vaccinated now have already had it and never knew it. And there will be duplicate positive tests, as well.

But if herd immunity can be achieved at 75% of the population having immunity, we're well on our way with 50% vaccination rates.",,,1622682798,{},h0dvrj9,False,t3_nqm614,False,True,t1_h0d4gba,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nqm614/threequarters_of_adults_in_uk_have_now_had_first/h0dvrj9/,1622804999,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Thanks. I didn't know they solved the trash can ""mystery"" (I assumed it was aerosols). I heard about it transmitting through aerosols before and that Covid aerosols can linger in the air for 20 minutes to a few hours. But I didn't realize they could float through a door and then through the air and through another door within 18 seconds. You would think that the viral concentration in the air would be insanely low at that distance with the door only open for a few seconds, but I guess not.

&gt; I'm going on a limb here, but B1617 appears to be more transmissible; several clusters in the newest wave of infections in Singapore have been linked to the Delta variant (B16172), like the Changi Airport cluster (108 cases) and the Tan Tock Seng Hospital cluster (48 cases). Cases from one more, the JEM/Westgate shopping centre cluster (50 cases) have tested preliminarily positive for B1617.

Damn. I heard about the airport and that a relatively large number of fully vaccinated people got infected, but I didn't know there were other outbreaks/superspreader events associated with this virus in Singapore.


&gt; It's a bit concerning that several of the possible index cases were fully vaccinated;

Yeah, no kidding. My understanding is that the MRNAs are around [75% effective against this variant, which is what the CEO of Pfizer said](https://globalnews.ca/news/7882376/biontech-covid-19-vaccine-india-variant/). The data from those outbreaks seems to support that claim.


&gt; the possible index case only visited one of the shopping centres - Westgate - on a single day (May 6) before testing positive the following day and subsequently being sent to the hospital.

Wait, does that mean they were hospitalized one day after contracting the virus?

Results: Seven days after the first vaccine dose HCWs with previous infection experienced a 126 fold increase in antibody levels (GMC 26955 AU; 95% CI 18785-35125). However, in the HCW naive group the response was much lower and only 5 of them showed positive antibody levels (&gt;50 AU). The HCWs with previous infection did not significantly increased their antibody levels after the second dose while there was a significant increase in the naive HCW group (16 fold; GMC 20227 AU; 95% CI: 15179-25275). Approximately two months after completing vaccination, the level of antibodies was much lower in naive HCWs (GMC 6595 AU vs. 25003 AU; p&lt;0.001)

I'm not sure where that's coming from, but people on immunosuppressants are urged to get vaccinated. It may or may not work (post-organ transplant, its about 25%) but the refrain on Reddit that immunocompromised people shouldn't get vaccinated is simply wrong.

Taiwan has been a model for how to control the pandemic, but a recent spike in domestic infections has increased the need to inoculate people faster.

During a video call with international media in Japan, Foreign Minister Joseph Wu repeated complaints that China, which claims the island as its own territory, has hampered efforts to secure more vaccines, and kept Taiwan excluded from the World Health Organisation.

So far, Taiwan has received only the Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) and AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) vaccines. But Wu said his government was ""negotiating with individual companies like Pfizer"" and J&amp;J, while expressing confidence in its domestic vaccine rollout.

""When and if our own vaccines are rolled out toward the end of July, I think this will become the most important supply for the vaccine demand here in Taiwan,"" Wu said.

Johnson &amp; Johnson was not immediately available for comment.

Responding to Reuters request for comment, Pfizer said: ""As Taiwan is outside the scope of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine collaboration agreement with BioNTech, we will have to refer you to BioNTech for any questions on this matter.""

BioNTech did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Wu did confirm, however, that the German government has helped with talks underway between Taiwan and BioNTech SE (22UAy.DE), after a deal fell through earlier this year. read more
Taiwan had blamed China for blocking that deal.

Beijing, which has offered to supply Chinese-made vaccines as well as BioNTech shots via the German firm's Chinese partner Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd (600196.SS), has denied that accusation.

Wu also cited Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi as saying that Japan is ""seriously and positively"" considering donating vaccines to Taiwan. ""Taiwan and Japan are always very good partners. And in times of difficulties, we always try to reach out to each other,"" Wu said.

Japan plans to donate about 1.2 million AstraZeneca vaccines to Taiwan, public broadcaster NHK reported.

This means we can’t really know how effective the vaccine is at preventing infection. We can only know how effective it is at preventing severe enough symptoms that the person seeks treatment and/or testing. 

This discrepancy matters because if vaccinated people are spreading covid without knowing it, we are still encouraging variants that will ultimately beat our vaccines. Additionally, our communities remain unsafe for those who cannot reap the benefits of vaccination. 

So we need to be aware of the limitations of our efficacy stats and push hard for mandatory vaccination for all who do not have a legitimate medical exemption. Religious &amp; philosophical exemptions aren’t appropriate in matters of public health. In the past, we made smallpox vaccination mandatory and we can and must do the same with covid. Really, we should have been doing it with measles, but too many of us falsely believed that personal freedom trumps all else despite that our Supreme Court has upheld that public safety is more important.",,,1622742904,{},h0gswl7,False,t3_nqzldd,False,True,t1_h0e3h5t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nqzldd/97_of_covid19_cases_in_king_county_are_among/h0gswl7/,1622871592,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
