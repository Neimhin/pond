Her school has a couple of thousands of students, and the cafeteria was crowded. In addition, the Round Rock Independent School District outside Austin didn’t require masks, so some students weren’t wearing them. Even her honors biology teacher was maskless.   
Daniels said her daughter, who like her is fully vaccinated, is terrified of bringing home the coronavirus because it could infect her 7-year-old sibling, who is too young for a shot.   
“Every morning I wake up with knots in my chest, just like, ‘Am I making the right decision, putting myself and my child at risk for my older two to go to school?’” said Daniels, who is immunocompromised.  
To top it off, students exposed to the virus may not be required to quarantine despite guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, risking an even more rapid spread among children, the youngest of whom aren’t yet eligible for vaccination.    
“An optional quarantine just doesn't work,” said Allison Stewart, lead epidemiologist at the Williamson County and Cities Health District, which oversees 12 school districts, including most Round Rock schools. When it isn’t required, “it seems that there’s only a cursory effort to actually identify contacts.” And then there’s only “a cursory effort to quarantine.”   
“There is more transmission occurring in a school setting than there is in the community right now,” Stewart said, “which is the exact opposite of what happened last year.”",,,,1630540454,{},hb9362e,True,t3_pg65lg,False,True,t3_pg65lg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pg65lg/to_quarantine_or_not_the_hard_choices_schools_are/hb9362e/,1630630266.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether or not vaccines will be *that* effective, you’ll likely also have access to Covid anti-viral pills you can start taking as soon as you test positive, stiffling the infection quickly. The Biden administration has already committed nearly 4 billion to the development of these drugs, and there seems to be a lot of optimism about this project. And while these measures would likely greatly reduce the risk of getting Long Covid, hopefully we’ll also have a much better understanding of the mechanisms behind it, and how to prevent and/or mitigate it.

Yes, overall it was extremely hard on parents to have kids at home and harder on both teachers and students to do school via zoom.

But, it wasn't hard for everyone. Some kids thrived learning online.

Also, hybrid learning was great when kids who were normally in the classroom but had to quarantine for a few weeks. Remote learning for a couple of weeks and then returning to the classroom is infinitely better than trying to do two weeks of worksheets and then returning two weeks behind.

What I'd love to see is:

* Mandatory vaccines for everyone eligible
* In-person is the default, with mandatory masks nationwide
* Districts are required to offer a full-remote option for kids who do better in that environment, or for kids who refuse to comply with the mask mandate
* All classrooms are hybrid-enabled, and when any kid is home sick or home quarantining, they can still watch their class and participate as much as possible from home
* When there's an outbreak, everyone in a class/grade/school/district goes home and switches to remote for 2 - 3 weeks
* Funding should be available to parents who want to host a distance learning pod at their home - that way parents who need to work would be able to get together with parents who can assist with remote learning and get compensated for it",,,,1630566734,{},hbaefvx,False,t3_pg1dgl,False,False,t3_pg1dgl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pg1dgl/worried_about_covid_most_parents_no_longer_want/hbaefvx/,1630654269.0,15,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

But it *does* come across as a bit tone deaf and missing the forest for the trees. By the time this vaccine is approved, it will simply be too late. Even in districts that do a good job of masking and isolation, most kids will have had COVID by the time this is approved so long as in-person schooling continues (which, right or wrong, is important to most kids and most families). Schools are low ventilation high interaction density germ factories that spread disease rampantly even when not in a pandemic. Delta is just too infectious to pretend like you can control it in those environments with NPIs. This isn't going to a grocery store; it's sitting feet away from others in a small classroom with substandard ventilation with 20-30 kids for 8 hours a day. 

It is pretty clear based on the preliminary vaccine studies and available disease data, COVID is clearly way worse for kids than the vaccines. Data points like this article reinforce that point. And, we're talking about public health here: every time a kid gets infected, they're probably infecting a parent or relative too. I had two fully vaccinated colleagues in two different states call out sick this week because their kid brought COVID home and they caught it too. And so community spread continues, killing the unvaccinated or the ultra-high risk vaccinated.

&gt;First identified in January 2021 in Colombia, the Mu variant has seen sporadic cases emerge throughout South America and Europe. Globally, the variant accounts for less than 0.1% of all cases worldwide. However, the WHO has noted that it has become considerably more prevalent in Colombia and Ecuador, where it accounts for approximately 39% and 13% of respective cases.

&gt;Further research is needed to accurately verify if this new variant, also known by the designations VUI-21JUL-01 and B.1.621, could be resistant to vaccines. The WHO is still monitoring it as a Variant Of Interest, as there are several mutations, two of which were designated E484K and K417N, suggesting it could resist immune defenses in a similar manner to the Beta variant found in South Africa.

As the vaccination campaign lags and the contagious Delta variant spreads, cases and hospitalizations are at their highest since last winter. Covid-19 deaths, too, are on a steady incline.

&gt;After every other peak has come a trough, however, often for reasons that were not immediately obvious. In Britain, where the variant is also the dominant form of the coronavirus, daily cases fell from a peak of 60,000 in mid-July to half that within two weeks, though they have since been climbing again.

&gt;In India, the numbers spiked to more than 400,000 daily cases this spring; experts estimated that the true figure could be more than 20 times greater. The unimaginable toll shocked many who had declared that the country had successfully eluded the virus. But then, in June, infections fell drastically.

&gt;Scientists are struggling to understand why Delta outbreaks in those countries dissipated, even if temporarily, and what that may mean for similar surges, including the one in the United States.

&gt;In the United States, the variant’s pace has slowed, and new infections are falling in some states, like Missouri, that Delta struck hard. The number of infections over the last week is now 14 percent higher than it was two weeks ago, a fraction of the rate during much of July and early August.

&gt;Is the Delta surge beginning to slow in the United States? Or is the variant putting the country on course for months of bumps and valleys?

&gt;Expert opinion varies widely on the direction of the virus in the coming months. A number of national forecasts being tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predict that cases will rise in the early weeks of September — but many foresee the opposite.

&gt;”Whatever downturn we have, I think, will be fairly mild,” said Dr. Celine Gounder, an epidemiologist and infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York. “We’re right at that tipping point where back-to-school will tip us back into growth at some point.”",,,,1630574724,{},hbaninf,True,t3_pgebk0,False,False,t3_pgebk0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pgebk0/when_will_the_delta_surge_end/hbaninf/,1630658601.0,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ok more ""out loud"" thinking: 

Some states would absolutely love available funds earmarked for education. Let them have it. Drift punish every state because others are bullheaded. As for the others.. Big gov could incentive states to funnel money into education somehow...? C'mon, teachers, coaches, etc., chime in: how do you creatively incentivize your ""worst"" students to make the right choices? Think pizza party but for state officials, lol. 

What about offering federal funded free education programs, and letting states also do what they want? Then states could privatize, but parents could easily chose the federal option. Federal gov is starting to take steps in paying for some years of community college and erasing student loans (I know, long way to go, but still, efforts being made) I don't see why they can't somehow make something work for pre-college education.

Or, direct tax benefits for teachers. Like, really really good ones. Free federal healthcare for educators... Direct gov-to-educators benefits..

I dunno. I'm deflated after thinking about all this.

The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, Vincent Marconi and colleagues9 assessed the use of baricitinib in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial (the COV-BARRIER study). Importantly, the study's randomisation was done strictly through an interactive response system and stratified by disease severity, age, region, and steroid use. The trial was conducted in 101 centres across 12 countries, and enrolled 1525 patients. Compared with placebo, patients who received baricitinib had a 38·2% relative reduction and 5 percentage points absolute reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality (hazard ratio \[HR\] 0·57 \[95% CI 0·41–0·78\]; nominal p=0·0018), with a number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one additional death of 20. No other anti-COVID-19 therapy has shown such a profound reduction in mortality. For comparison, the only other two immunomodulatory treatments that were associated with a reduction in mortality were dexamethasone (which showed a 17% relative reduction and 2·8% absolute reduction in mortality and an NNT of 36)6 and tocilizumab (which showed a 15% relative reduction and 4% absolute reduction in mortality and an NNT of 25);10 however, these treatments were assessed in open-label trials with a high-risk of bias",,,,1630592631,{},hbbiail,True,t3_pgiwpz,False,False,t3_pgiwpz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pgiwpz/baricitinib_the_first_immunomodulatory_treatment/hbbiail/,1630674099.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

There’s a few titles for books that you might enjoy: “Trauma-sensitive yoga:bringing the body into treatment” and “overcoming trauma through yoga”, both by David Emerson. Then the “main” yoga book is called “yoga sutras of Patanjali”. (I don’t condone piracy and there’s a website called libgen that I’d avoid if you want to download them for free, in any format. )

I started using YouTube videos when I started. Yoga with Adrienne and Cole Chance are very pleasant instructors who create videos. Then I took a class and felt super overwhelmed because I didn’t understand how fast they were going. So I enrolled in a yoga teacher training to make my own sequences. I’m currently (and very slowly) working on a project. My Instagram handle is @halfspeedyoga. The idea is to offer the information you’d pay for in a teacher training (yoga philosophy, forms and anatomy), but for free. And I’d like to develop an app to upload classes on. Main focus will be inner child healing. 

Follow where your life energy is taking you, if that’s yoga, give it a shot because it might just be the last piece you need to continue rebuilding on your journey.

&gt;*One of the virtues of meta-analysis is that it allows conclusions to be adjusted with changing evidence. One Randomized Controlled Trial included in the BIRD Group's meta-analysis of Ivermectin has been challenged in The Guardian. It is unclear if the study in question is fatally flawed. In this clip, Tess Lawrie shows us what happens to the meta-analysis when the suspect study is eliminated. Answer: the estimate of the medication's effectiveness change somewhat (prevention of death drop's from 62% to 49%. Prophylactic effectiveness goes up slightly from 86% to 87%. Confidence intervals become somewhat wider). The conclusion of the analysis remains the same: Ivermectin reduces deaths substantially and is a very effective preventive measure against the contraction of COVID-19.*

All they needed to say is that your health does predict your outcome. Healthier people will fare better than those with chronic health conditions.

Covid is a threat. It is even more likely to harm you if you have diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, and other conditions. Over the course of the next year we will be working to make it easier for you to access healthy foods, providing free fruits and vegetables to every family as an incentive to get healthier. 

We believe that be increasing fruit and vegetable consumption we can save tens of thousands of people from dying from covid and here is the research to support our findings.

_______

The issue with completely ignoring health is that we now find ourselves a year and a half later, people gained about 2lbs per month and are more sick than before the pandemic. This will put people at risk for deaths bud hospitalization even if they are vaccinated. 

Are we healthier now than before the pandemic? I wouldn’t say so. We had the chance to encourage the country to eat healthier and to actually incentivize it and we failed to do it.

A number of people being hospitalized now are also people who have been infected more than once.

Even looking at that study, it still also shows that being vaccinated and having the virus offered far more protection than just natural immunity. You also have to keep in mind that this study did not include the Delta variant.

A while ago, I believe that 10/11 of the /r/Coronavirus moderators agreed to private the subreddit to protest but the top mod felt that the subreddit was too important for health information, and removed the other mods.

A kicked out mod:

&gt; However, certain subreddits should be handled differently when they have an over-reaching scope that affects more than just the Reddit community and situations like this occur.
&gt; 
&gt; In this case, I think the situation concerning the main /r/Coronavirus subreddit should at least be more closely examined.
&gt;  
&gt; A large portion of the most active moderators have already left the mod team at this point, and they were ones that had an actual passion for helping the Reddit community get through this public health crisis.
&gt; 
&gt; Many have medical backgrounds and I've seen them all work tirelessly and spend hours upon hours throughout the past year to improve various aspects of the subreddit coming up with new ideas and resources to keep the public up to date on the virus.
&gt; 
&gt; **It's entirely within their rights to do so, but having one single top mod come in and single-handedly dictate subreddit policy on such an important subreddit when that policy will likely affect millions of people**, as well as do things like remove every single permission from every single mod below them, are things that should not be allowed.

Who knows.

Honestly, there's no crystal balls or accurate predictions about whether you're going to get it or what will happen if you do. We only know that your chances of becoming hospitalized or dying is significantly less if you're vaccinated.  So you got that going for you. We already know that outdoor stuff is better than indoor but big crowds are more dangerous, so there's also that. None of that is helpful, sorry. I hate all the uncertainty too.

If you're vaxxed and masked, what I would do (*in my non-professional, know-nothing-more-than-anyone-else and just tries to keep up to date on official recommendations opinion) is look at my whole situation. If I did not have underlying conditions including obesity I would get tested a few days prior and stay home until then; if negative (of course) I would go to the festival; and then wait 3 days and get tested again, staying away from people, not coming in close contact with anyone else for more than 5 minutes, etc. until my second results came back. I have tickets to a Rugby match in LV and this is what I plan on doing. I will be masked the whole time I'm not drinking $22 beers and you have to have proof of vaccination to get into the stadium. I don't plan to be indoors anywhere (except my hotel room) for the one day I'm going to be in Vegas. I also work from home so staying away from others before and after is easy (and I hate people, so bonus). If any of these things were different, like if I lived with immune suppressed folks, unvaxxed kids, worked with them, or the public in any other fashion I'd have different things to think about. 

I hate thinking about it, but I think if Covid isn't forever it's at least here for a long time and we have to make the smartest decisions we can while still living our lives as mentally and physically well as we can as little specks on this space rock.

This could explain why the previous Random Control Trials showed no benefits to any kind of mask: Respirators or otherwise. It's possible the data needed to be stratified by age to find a benefit.

For example, here is this peer reviewed and published RCT that shows no statistically significant benefit to masks:

It's *asinine* that some teachers have 20+ kids. 10 is impossible to imagine! I mean, look at these comment threads - parents can't handle their one, two, three kids for a year of homeschooling, do we honestly expect one teacher to successfully educate, corral, and individually help an entire gaggle of them, every day?!

Hybrid learning would allow for half a school to be online while the other half is in school. Rotate the schedules. 

Let's not even get into supply shortages and the fact teachers have to buy a lot of classroom items out of pocket. We now have millions in funds freed up *per day* from the Afghanistan war ending to shift over to educators. And again, no corporation should receive money before our education system. Gross.

I'm just spitballing. Maybe I'm stupid for thinking this could work but I think it's stupid the only arguments anymore are forcing a new system onto a broken machine.

Ivermectin is a drug that’s existed for like 40 years for human use as an anti-parasitic.  Now I know, viruses aren’t parasites, I’m not saying take it.

That said, it’s something that has demonstrated some efficacy, so saying the ((human)) form is useless is also “misinformation”:

Now that said, why not to take it: current studies show you need to take a lot of it.  And I mean a very unsafe amount.  That said, there’s other studies in the US and UK ongoing to investigate its efficacy in lower doses (currently in Phase 3 in the US):

As an example, in WWII, we were able to very accurately estimate the number of tanks the Germans made based off the statistical analysis of a small number of serial numbers taken from destroyed tanks.

I can't speak for how the 3 million / 3% number was arrived at, but here are some possibilities:

* Some counties report the numbers, and others don't. You can extrapolate for the counties which didn't report based on the rates seen in the counties that did. You could further refine this by using data from other places to see how things like like urban density are likely to affect things.
* Even if cases aren't reported, deaths or hospitalizations can be. Again, you can use data from other places to see what the ratios of these numbers to the number of infected tends to be, and thus calculate how many infections must have taken place as a result.
* You can model how the virus spreads among a population. If you have vaccine data, you can factor that in. We have good data around how many people get infected and how fast, detailed by which strains are dominate, what percentage of the population is vaccinated, how densely populated an area is, and how much people are moving around (which you can tell based on data from cell towers which let you see how often people are moving between towers). These models are only as good as the information you feed them, but if you have good data to start with, they can be surprisingly accurate.

Ultimately, we don't actually know the number of unreported cases, but we have a number of ways of coming up with a really good guess.

For anyone who isn’t aware of why this is an important question, sometimes antibodies from outside the body are used to stop immune reactions. For example, when someone with Rh negative blood is pregnant with a potentially Rh positive fetus, they’ll get a couple of injections of Rh antibody that will coat any fetal cells that might be in her bloodstream and keep the maternal immune system from forming antibodies against them, which could cause miscarriage of future pregnancies. 

So, if regeneron does the same thing, and hides viral particles from the patient’s immune system, we would want to know that. 

I don’t *think* it does, since generally there are early symptoms before you’d get the infusion, but that’s an educated guess, and it would be nice to have some firm study on that. Or if it creates a weaker immunity. I do know you should wait until the monoclonal antibodies have fully cleared before getting a vaccine, to make sure they don’t interfere with the immune response to the vaccine. 

I’ll add that to the list of things I’m watching for studies on, because that’s an interesting question.",,,,1630605480,{},hbce0pl,False,t3_pgco9t,False,False,t1_hbccdrk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pgco9t/daily_discussion_thread_september_02_2021/hbce0pl/,1630691998.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the part I don't understand.  It's like a collective delusion.  Another person on Reddit posted a few months ago that he/she had to go to a funeral for a family member, and the extended family all showed up and treated it like a family reunion, nobody wearing masks.  The funeral, the dead person?  Died from COVID.  So... treating a funeral like ""hey let's get together and party"" already seems insensitive, but then to not wear masks as you mourn a COVID death in a room full of extended family members seems... stupid... at least.  And of course that person was posting to Reddit because, you guessed it, the extended family came down with COVID.

It almost feels like people not only don't value life anymore, but they don't even value *their own* lives.  They're acting like, ""Ha ha!  So what if I die?  So what if *you* die?  Drive recklessly, boycott science, do hard drugs and fall into addiction, fuck random people and if you get an STD pass that shit on to the next random you fuck because NOTHING MATTERS AND I DON'T CARE!  I won't mourn you when you're gone, but I'll make a joke at your funeral and get a laugh, so that'll be cool.""

I know how frustrating it is as someone that loves to push myself on my bike. I'm never one to rest an injury, if I tear something in my knee I'm back out riding the next day with KT tape.

I took me over a full year to really get back to 100% at cycling. You do get better, and it will seem almost instantaneous when it happens.

I was infected last March, and after my symptoms left I thought I was fine. I went for a ride, did almost a mile, turned back, collapsed on the sofa and puked. The last ride I did before I got sick was around 50 miles.

It wasn't until August that I could ride any amount of distance, and that was on flat rail trails. Anything with a hill and I was done. I was also slow, but each time I went further. It helped my girlfriend rode with me.

But anytime I tried to push, I'd end up crashed for a few days. Same thing with any exertion. I could only have sex on Fridays, as I'd be wiped for two straight days. But being me, despite everyone saying take it easy, I'd go push myself. I puked a lot this last year.

Finally this May-June I started riding like I used to, but it was sporadic. One ride I'd be great, the next ride I'd get wiped out and have to sit mid ride.

But now I'm not only back to riding like I used to, but also just crushed a bunch of old personal records on a bunch of Strava segments. I compared a bunch. In March, I rode one particular segment at 13mph. In May and through July I did it at ~16mph. My previous record was 20mph on that segment. This last time, 24mph!

Now, once I get this Covid weight off I'll really be fast.

I do have bouts of insomnia though. Not sure if that's Covid related, or just anxiety about the state of things.

I think our health care system is partially blamed because of this. 
Since there is distrust of the institution that turns people to medical bankruptcy if they need help from sorts of illness or injury. Asking help towards fixing a minor or substantial issue heath wise costs you an eye, arms, or leg to even get that help. There are some shady practices that the medical industry practically corrupts practices by enticing them to certain medication from company and only to that pharma company for a certain ailment. 

Along with political rhetoric of the Republican party. A party that once promotes social welfare now wages social warfare. With the rhetoric of anti intellectualism in the party and its ideology it prevents their constituents from gaining correct path knowledge towards questioning governing body, governing ethics, foreign and immigration policy reform, science and technological ethicd and mst of all questioning corporate powers that influence heavily on our sociopolitical and socioeconomic issues.

But then again the damn thing is free and the side effects are like a day or two. Come on man if you broke an arm or leg before, you can get pass this.

[From a recent Cochrane review.](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD015017.pub2/full)

Based on the current **very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence**, we are uncertain about the efficacy and safety of ivermectin used to treat or prevent COVID‐19. The completed studies are small and few are considered high quality. Several studies are underway that may produce clearer answers in review updates. Overall, **the reliable evidence available does not support the use of ivermectin for treatment or prevention of COVID‐19** outside of well‐designed randomized trials.

[Official statement from Merck.](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/)

Merck known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:
**No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19** from pre-clinical studies; 
**No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19** disease, and; 
A concerning **lack of safety data in the majority of studies.**

She has been sedated almost a month and of course has not seen her newborn. She was on a ventilator until they decided that alone was doing too much damage to her lungs so they put her on ecmo with less ventilator power. Then they decided to do a tracheotomy to move the ventilator, and surgery to insert a feeding tube. All this while recovering from a csection. A lung transplant hasn't been ruled out. The other day her o2 dropped to 40%.  She has bed sores that they have to be careful about treating because movement can cause o2 to drop too. The longer she's on the machines, the longer and harder recovery.. and more chance for deficits. 

I have no idea - does sedation ease the pain? Do the doctors one day say ""sorry, it isn't looking up and we need this machine for someone else who is more likely to survive""?  Will she be the ""same"" person if she comes out of this?

The issue is that there are not enough ECMO machines. They cost 5-10X more per unit than a vent and more complex and require more maintenance and monitoring to boot. Because of this, there is also some bias here in terms of who gets placed on them (younger patients with more life years ahead of them may get prioritized which may impact survival rates for example). 

If they weren't in such short demand, there is an argument that ECMO should be considered before ventilators because ventilators can cause lung damage over time that aggravates the underlying damage from infection. That said, ECMO carries its own major risks - bleeding out during installation and removal of the device, blood clots, and systemic infection are big ones that have to be considered.

I've been working remotely from home and live alone, so I haven't had any human contact this entire time. But it was alright. I kept safe and protected those around me in doing so as well. And with vaccines being widely available (even if not as widely accepted as I'd like) it seemed like things were... well, not returning back to normal, but at least getting to a point where it seemed like I might have some opportunity to have some level of human connection again in the near future.

And then Delta hit. Now, I feel even less safe than I did last year, even though I'm vaccinated. The vaccine has only ever reduced infection rates to about 1/7 of what it is for unvaccinated people, which was fine in the context of reaching a level of herd immunity. But Delta is about 7 times as infectious as the original strain, which means that herd immunity is basically off the table, and it seems like I only have two options now - either hope that when I eventually catch the virus, the vaccine allows me to have minimal symptoms from it, or live the rest of my life alone and shut away from everyone.

As much as I hate masks too, keeping a mask mandate until the majority of the country is vaccinated is probably necessary, and was before Delta. With people finally traveling to visit family for the first time in over a year, there was just a huge chance of spread. I think keeping indoor mask mandates while they slowly dropped other mandates would have been the better option, honestly.

Covid 0 has been thrown out the window since Delta.

However, the medical system can still be strained to the point of collapse and we need AS MANY people vaccinated as possible to reduce hospitalizations.

That's the end goal here.

Yeah, covid is likely to be around forever, mainly due to Delta (If delta hadn't arisen we'd basically be done by now).

The best way to get back to normal is to get EVERYONE vaccinated. If everyone vaccinated right now, we could lift almost every restriction out there. 

If we were all vaccinated, it would be akin to the flu. You're likely to get it at -some- point in your life, but it won't kill you, and the big thing is that you won't overwhelm the hospitals.

So to answer your question, unfortunately, we can't return to normal until we've gotten enough of the population (90-95%+) vaccinated to ensure the medical system will not collapse. When that happens, we can go back to normal.

If we just lift all restrictions right now, so many will die, not just of covid, but of manageable issues that require hospitalizations that aren't available due to the healthcare strain.

And no, before you say 'just increase beds FOREHEAD', it's not that simple. Burnout is very real, and nurses/doctors are not easy to come by right now. They're already dealing with heavy workload from covid the past 1-2 years, and increasing it even more will lead to a quicker healthcare collapse.

So, to fully answer your question, since I know we are only getting 95% vaccinated in my dreams: We will be able to return to normal when enough of the mouthbreathers get sick enough to either die, or develop enough antibodies to create a rolling endemic rather than pandemic, through the use of lockdowns and restrictive measures over months to ensure the safety of our healthcare system, to ensure the mouthbreathers catch covid over time rather than all at once.",,,,1630538085,{},hb8yj5v,False,t3_pfu6l4,False,False,t1_hb8furh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pfu6l4/september_isnt_bringing_a_return_to_normal_many/hb8yj5v/,1630627851.0,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Entitlement has been through the roof since March 2020, people refusing to follow basic guidelines, and since I work at a pet store, I have to deal with the people who wanted a quarantine pet that they barely knew how to take care of (and most couldn't care less - hamsters and fish and reptiles and birds are literally just decorations or toys to some people). 

I'm burned out. I'm exhausted. I spend most of my days teetering between mental stability and feeling like I need to go into a psych hospital again. 

I see people who couldn't give less of a fuck about if another person lives or dies, so long as they don't have to wear a scary piece of cloth on their face.

 I never ven got to lock down. I've had to be at work 5 days a week since this pandemic started. No comfy sitting at home working without being face to face with people who think that buying a fucking hamster is their God given right and that quarantine doesn't apply to them.

And to top it all of, there's been no hazard pay. No raises. In 2020 corporate gave me maybe a total of $300-$400 extra (before taxes of course) and cut my hours in half. Have I gotten those hours back? Barely. We now work with crew that makes bare bones look overstaffed. Same hours of operation, same operational expectations, only a fraction of the manpower. 

Last year we got a letter that said thank you and this year they gave us a bit more money and some small bonuses. Now instead of barely making over federal minimum wage, I'm making just a few bucks under what could be considered a barely livable wage.

&gt;Meta-analyses based on 18 randomized controlled treatment trials of ivermectin in COVID-19 have found large, statistically significant reductions in mortality, time to clinical recovery, and time to viral clearance. Furthermore, results from numerous controlled prophylaxis trials report significantly reduced risks of contracting COVID-19 with the regular use of ivermectin. Finally, the many examples of ivermectin distribution campaigns leading to rapid population-wide decreases in morbidity and mortality indicate that an oral agent effective in all phases of COVID-19 has been identified.

There is also a listing of of 113 controlled studies, FWIW, though the robot removes it if I link it here.

This doesn't mean that every new dominating variant will be more lethal, it could go the other way next time. Alpha and Delta both found a way to replicate faster inside their host after infection. ""More virus inside the host"" leads to higher probability of severe disease and more virus shedding (= spreads easier which leads to them becoming the dominant variant).

Maybe the next variant to become dominant will specialize in infecting your throat, nose etc. and won't infect lungs, liver and kidneys as often. So it will be less lethal, but it will spread like wildfire because you have even more virus in your nose and throat, so you spread it everywhere you go and breathe.

Many viruses are different because you feel terrible before you can infect others.

&gt;The study, which was published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal on Wednesday, also provides more evidence that the two-shot Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines offer powerful protection against symptomatic and severe disease.

&gt;”This is really, I think, the first study showing that long Covid is reduced by double vaccination, and it’s reduced significantly,” said Dr. Claire Steves, a geriatrician at King’s College London and the study’s lead author.

&gt;Although many people with Covid recover within a few weeks, some experience long-term symptoms, which can be debilitating. This constellation of lingering aftereffects that have become known as long Covid may include fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog, heart palpitations and other symptoms. But much about the condition remains mysterious.

&gt;”We don’t have a treatment yet for long Covid,” Dr. Steves said. Getting vaccinated, she said, “is a prevention strategy that everybody can engage in.”

&gt;The findings add to a growing pile of research on so-called breakthrough infections among vaccinated people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed that the highly contagious Delta variant is causing more of these breakthroughs than other versions of the virus, although infections in fully vaccinated people still tend to be mild.

&gt;The new findings are based on data from more than 1.2 million adults in the Covid Symptom Study, in which volunteers use a mobile app to log their symptoms, test results and vaccination records. The participants include those who received at least one dose of the Pfizer, Moderna or AstraZeneca vaccines between Dec. 8 and July 4, as well as a control group of unvaccinated people.

&gt;Of the nearly 1 million people who were fully vaccinated, 0.2 percent reported a breakthrough infection, the researchers found. Those who did get breakthrough infections were roughly twice as likely to be asymptomatic as were those who were infected and unvaccinated. The odds of being hospitalized were 73 percent lower in the breakthrough group than the infected, unvaccinated group.

&gt;The odds of having long-term symptoms — lasting at least four weeks after infection — were also 49 percent lower in the breakthrough group.

&gt;”Of course, vaccines also massively reduce your risk of getting infected in the first place,” Dr. Steves said. That lowered risk means that vaccination should reduce the odds of long Covid by even more, she noted.

&gt;The study has limitations, the researchers acknowledge, the most notable of which is that the data is all self-reported. Long Covid is also difficult to study, with wide-ranging symptoms that may vary enormously in severity.

&gt;But Dr. Steves said that she hoped the findings might encourage more young people, whose vaccination rates have lagged behind, to get the shots. Young adults are less likely to become seriously ill from the virus than older adults, but they are still at risk for long Covid, she noted.

&gt;”Being out of action for six months has a major impact on people’s lives,” she said. “So, if we can show that their personal risk of long Covid is reduced by getting their vaccinations, that may be something that may help them make a decision to go ahead and get a vaccine.”

[],,gengengis,,,[],,,,text,t2_4fwaj,False,False,[],"Reddit is pretty good at downvoting bullshit, and calling out bullshit.  Reddit is in better shape than Facebook, or Twitter.  Where Reddit breaks down is when subreddit moderators use their ability to ban users to instill a mono culture, or an echo chamber.

The solution to this is not banning the subreddit.  Look at what happened with a certain sub associated with a former president that moved off Reddit and onto their own platform.  That community has higher traffic now than it ever did on Reddit, and it has no rules, and it is far crazier now than it was before.

That same community allows every other community banned on Reddit to setup shop there, and they do.  Banning it on Reddit often makes it worse

The solution is meta moderation.  Don't let moderators of these subs use banning to control the culture.  There is no reason Reddit needs to allow moderators unchecked power over a fiefdom.

Here's a simple suggestion: using objective measures, like the standard deviation of number of bans, or the number of community complaints, subject subreddits to sanctions.

Sanctions might include things like meta review of ban decisions.  When a moderator bans a user, surface this decision to moderators of unrelated subreddits.  They will moderate the moderation decision.

If a moderator has a large number of decisions overruled, remove the moderator.

Basically, allow the broader community to police nefarious moderators.

How about we stop blaming “the media.”

Point to the idiots raiding tractor supply stores and poisoning/self-treating against the advice of their own human medical doctors. They gave Ivermectin a bad name **because they’re idiots** … **and they’re ruining it for everyone**. 

Best answer, always: 

Please follow FDA guidance and only take Ivermectin **exactly as prescribed by your own licensed human-person medical doctor**.

Nobody debates N95s are effective, even antimaskers. If the messaging had been clear from the get-go that this was a temporary stopgap with a clear transition to real PPE that actually works, then they would be a lot less obstinate about this. 

They literally believe that since these masks arent effective, that the masking efforts are purely about social control, and when you see the useless mask theater like everyone wearing barely effective masks while shoulder to shoulder in metal tubes commuting for 4-8 hours in planes and the like, its pretty easy to see how they could maybe come to that conclusion.

We need these mandates to make sense in order to convince people to follow them.

It's not ""wrong,"" it's just unlikely. Put together enough of these studies and you start seeing the full bell curve of results, and throwing it out is tossing real sampling.

Suppose more studies skew high than low, and removing them is enough to take the results of the metastudy from 2.8% to 3.1%. I'd argue that's not wrong, always conditional on the studies being well reviewed and sound. And if the real efficacy of the drug is 3%, you're getting a better picture from including every study.

Obviously a lot of math goes into what you can conclude from samples of different sizes, but I think the key concept here is variation is to be expected.

So that's my view about it: vaccine passports from the point of an individual level are not very relevant, considering vaccinated can transmit the disease (even if with a less likelihood) and will not be tested as much as part of this policy. At a societal level, they can increase the vaccination rates, as being unvaccinated becomes a nuisance. However, in countries with high vaccination rates it's mostly a feel good measure. For countries with low vaccination rates, there's another problem - if a significant part of your population is reluctant to do something and the state effectively forces them to do it, that's not going to do wonders for the political health of your society in the long term, as now you have a large portion of your population with a grudge against the rest and with an even bigger distrust of public institutions.

Often studies will find a link, but too weak to conclude much based on the sample size. Say for a group of 200 you find some drug improves outcomes by 3%, but you would've needed to find 5% to conclude a statistically significant correlation at the level of confidence you're aiming for. The study therefore could not conclude the drug helped, but is that because it actually doesn't help or it just doesn't help enough to be demonstrated with a small sample size? But get thousands of people into your sample size by grouping together a bunch of studies, and suddenly even if the benefit is still only 3% you have enough people to have confidence in that result. 

Based on this you can see how a single falsified study might skew the results. If your total population is 10,000 people, and 2,000 of them are from a study showing that a drug causes a 60% improvement of some measure and all the others hover around 0% because the drug doesn't work, that can really mess with your data.",,,,1630597624,{},hbbu81s,False,t3_pgged9,False,False,t1_hbbl9u5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pgged9/a_major_study_used_by_antivaccine_figures/hbbu81s/,1630680785.0,17,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,HW90,,,[],,,,text,t2_58rca,False,False,[],"I think the UK situation just shows that it's not going to be as easy as it could have been, rather than that it's horrendously bad.

Maintaining high numbers was always a possibility with borderline herd immunity, the UK has been unlucky in that it reached that point whilst cases were relatively high. To an extent this might also be a good long term plan because it's reinforcing vaccine immunity with natural immunity at a time when this causes the least amount of harm. I imagine if this wasn't the idea they were going for then they would have announced a circuit breaker around early autumn which would drop the cases back down substantially.

It's worth noting that the UK's cases are only really climbing because of Scotland, the other constituent countries have pretty stable case levels, if not slightly decreasing. Whilst schools restarting earlier in Scotland is a contributing factor to this, it's difficult to say whether it's the factor which is breaking herd immunity. Scotland has always had to implement stricter restrictions than England to achieve the same results so this might just be another case of the same thing happening again.

It's likely a case of being one well-tailored vaccine away from a solution rather than anything more prolonged.

It appears you are making the case that obesity does not contribute substantially to hospitalization, because the percent of hospitalized covid patients that are obese is similar to obesity in general population (so, by this reasoning, covid hospitalizations are merely tracking against population metrics). 

The reason I dont think this is true is that covid exploits comorbidities generally. Obesity isnt the only one, theres cancer, diabetes, immuno-compromised, and many others. And I think age--85+, is the biggest factor. Anyway what Im saying is that if 78% of covid hospitalizations are obese, that doesnt mean the other 22% are perfectly healthy. That 22% likely, by and large, have other comorbidities. 

Honestly it would be interesting to see hospitalization or death rate for healthy individuals without comorbidities.

My completely unscientific WAG is that the zoonotic origin of the virus could have happened anywhere in the world and the virus was circulating worldwide at low levels, undetected for months before Dec 2019. Some mutation of the virus happened in Wuhan in Dec 2019 that caused it to explode across Hubei. Another mutation happened in Europe to cause the D614G strain that spread across the world and then another mutation in India caused the Delta variant that we have today.

We've seen that each successive mutation effectively wipes the previous one off the map over the course of about 2 months. This coupled with early testing in other countries being restricted only to those with travel history to China means we lost key parts of the evidence. This would explain why animal testing in China failed to find the origin of the virus and how we have so many puzzling (frustratingly ambiguous) reports of early COVID (in France, Italy, Brazil, the US) that complicate the timeline.

The media has been shockingly complicit in not airing the totality of the early covid evidence. eg: 3 deer were recently found with COVID antibodies across different states in the US in Jan 2020 but this news barely made a ripple: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/wild-us-d...",,,,1630614522,{},hbd0sxw,False,t3_pgo7tv,False,True,t3_pgo7tv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pgo7tv/how_did_a_kansas_grandmother_just_become_the/hbd0sxw/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,64f0126798d26e1e529651ea73f8d6207c8a272d,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1630614537.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

at this point it is not enough to shift any particularly state for sure. i looked at congressional seat level data but did not see any where it would shift there either, but keep in mind that it's hard to find excess death data on that level and even harder to find that age/race/gender/party delineated.

  
that said, demographics typically slowly shift a certain way and covid is essentially killing xx% more than a usual year, so you'd see that much of an increase in shift, so perhaps a few months worth of extra shift, maybe a year extra?

  
it's too hard to figure out how many of each party of each age vote, but my suspicion is that elderly donkeys vote less than elderly elephants which might cause a greater shift than the numbers would indicate. 

one thing to note would be if florida/texas have a TON of extra deaths, the electoral votes per person would be a little wonky, but that will sort itself out next cycle

As far as I can see, that ""1 in 7"" figure is not actually in the study at all.  The closest seemed to be that there were 30% postive testing with 3+ symptoms vs 16% negative-testing, so I suspect some journalist just subtracted one from the other and ignored all the careful qualification around issues and went with the ""14% with long covid figure"".  But even ignoring that that's not what the study actually said, just subtracting like that isn't correct, since it ignores overlaps in the populations.  

&gt;but the signal is quite clearly higher in the Covid-positive group of kids.

[],,emrythelion,,,[],,,,text,t2_a2jat,False,False,[],"That can definitely still be depression. You can absolutely still have fun doing specific things while also being depressed. In severe cases, some people feel absolutely apathetic about everything… but in many cases, people still have things they enjoy. Said things can also be a comfort and distraction from the depression itself.

Personally, during my depression, I also still enjoyed video games. The running out of steam aspect was also the exact same problem I had. I enjoyed gaming, but I could run out of steam quick. Doesn’t mean I didn’t enjoy the gaming before, but it would honestly be like I used up all of my ability to enjoy something too quickly, so I’d have to move on faster. And if I couldn’t move on to a different game, that’s when I’d get tired or more apathetic.

Now that I’m in a much better mental space, I don’t have that same issue anymore. I still get bored occasionally, but I always did- but it just doesn’t feel the same. It legitimately felt like I’d run out of steam playing a game when I was depressed, whereas now it’s just minor boredom… and I take a short break and enjoy doing something else and then can get back to it no problem.

I’m not saying you absolutely have depression or anything- but you should still talk to your doctor about it. Being able to enjoy something doesn’t mean you aren’t depressed, and there are a lot of levels to depression and they effect everyone differently. And if it’s not depression, feeling overly fatigued is a symptom for a lot of things, so it’s worth talking to your doctor about what you’re dealing with. Stress, anxiety, vitamin deficiencies, allergies, etc. can cause fatigue. And feeling fatigued like that is miserable.

Congrats on figuring out the sleep apnea! Getting proper sleep at night is a great first step.

Some of the symptoms are probably via a similar mechanism as ME CFS. But so far, we know way to little to dismiss it as ""just ME CFS"". ME CFS is serious as well, that's why it's good for them to get recognition.

There is also the mystery of viral persistence, the WHO made a statement about this:

""We are beginning to understand why people get these symptoms. They include persistence of the virus in some parts of the body that are sheltered from the immune system, such as the brain; direct damage to organs, such as the heart and lungs, and also the pancreas, causing some new cases of diabetes; and blood clotting, which can cause heart attacks and strokes. However, there is a huge variety in both the pattern of symptoms and their severity.""

You can make your own choices. For me, I'm awaiting research about how well the vaccines protect against long covid before taking risks.

But this is just wrong: 
&gt;And honestly what average parents have the time and the ability to stay home and teach their children without working.

Many do. And they dont need the ability to do all the teaching, they just need resources to supervise an education plan. 

Personally I would say If you want to go by the best adjusted, highest grades, social character development, and minimum input by ""average parents"", by all means send your kids off to a private boarding school. All data shows this has the best outcome.

There are no longer any age criteria (other than being aged ≥12 years) for using these agents in patients with the following conditions: sickle cell disease, neurodevelopmental disorders, medical-related technological dependence, asthma, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and chronic lung disease.",,,,1630546624,{},hb9gjq5,False,t3_pg4jfm,False,True,t1_hb9fyk3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pg4jfm/joe_rogan_a_podcasting_giant_who_has_been/hb9gjq5/,1630637252.0,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This commentor is basically saying, “If we have more time without restrictions, people would be okay cooperating later.”

No, probably not. In fact, dropping the restrictions just made people careless and accelerated the spread and helped overflow ICUs.

Moreover - “America is diverse” is correct and not everyone lives in a state with miles and miles of open land and low population density. 

Here in NJ, we have THE highest population density in the country. Higher than India or the Philippines too. So, we have to handle a pandemic much more cautiously because it can spread so much faster in a place like this.

Mask color had a statistically significant but minor impact on mask adoption.



&gt; This study has several implications for policy-makers. First, there is **clear evidence that community mask-wearing can reduce COVID-19.** The effects were **substantially larger in communities where surgical masks were distributed**, consistent with greater filtration efficiency measured in laboratories, and surgical masks reduced 1 in 3 symptomatic infections among individuals aged 60+.



&gt;Second, community mask-wearing can be increased through a combination of four core intervention elements, now called the “NORM” model, which stands for “No-cost mask distribution, Offering information, Reinforcement to wear masks, and Modeling by local leaders. Many other factors did not increase mask-wearing: researchers found no evidence that public commitments, village level incentives, text messages, altruistic messaging, or verbal commitments changed mask-wearing behavior in this context, which underscores the importance of rigorous, real-world testing before rolling out behavioral interventions at scale.

I am recovering from breakthrough infection, self-employed healthcare worker who was vaccinated in February.  I was so winded I couldn't stand up. I am so fatigued I am barely functioning. I haven't worked in two weeks. Not that it matters, but I am not obese, no pre-existing conditions, unless pandemic stress-fatigue-burnout counts, which of course it does.   
My toddler has interstitial lung disease, and asthma. He is on inhalers 4 times a day and sleeps with oxygen support. He was due for a repeat CT and bronchial lavage to check on the ground-glass opacities throughout his lungs, which of course now is rescheduled another two months out. He cannot be vaccinated. He is at the greatest risk. Thank god he has tested negative, and we hope it stays that way. 

Whether you believe me or not, I see almost no one. I do not leave the house without a mask. We do not socialize with the VACCINATED without masking indoors, us and them. We have absolutely no idea how I caught it. NO CLUE. Maybe my stress was so high it took one molecule?  Maybe walking by someone on a sidewalk? I do not know anyone in my circle of vaccinated masked people who have gotten it. It is a mystery. 

No one I know or have seen (which is about 5 people in the entire month of august, from afar, outdoors) has tested positive. Maybe asymptomatic? But please, your freedom to not mask is more important. Thank goodness we are privileged middle-class, my spouse can take time off (without pay, mind you, no more PTO left because we often have a sick kid), we can keep our health insurance, we won't lose our home...I'm scared to make those student loan payments though.

There are millions of people that are not getting the vaccine for a slurry of reasoning. the one that gets the most attention, even though a minority of those who are not getting vaccinated, are getting all the media attention. Back to the social group though, like I said, people want to be apart of a social group, because we are social animals. If they feel like they are outside of their social group they become depressed and have a feeling of abandonment. Changing a viewpoint is very hard to do. When you have a shining torch that everyone is looking at (Joe rogan) you feel like you are apart of a social group, which you are. But when that torch goes out that will not change your opinion. IF Joe Rogan now says trust the vaccine, some will more than likely go get the first jab, but there will still be people that are anti-vaccine. Look at what Trump said at that rally. He said the vaccines were good and to take it, then he gets boo'd. what the media supported was the anti-vaccine people. headlines should have simply said ""Ex-President Donald Trump is in Full Support of Vaccinations."" That would have spiked the numbers in vaccinations, it would have reached out to those who are just hesitant, not anti-vaccine.  


People that are just hesitant will subscribe to the anti-vaccine movement, not because they are full fledge anti-vaccine, but they aren't being shamed for being hesitant. my own story, though I cannot speak for the majority, I have a very close friend who I work with and he was/is hesitant. He and I have nuanced conversations about the vaccines. he has recently said that he is looking for someone to do the J&amp;J vaccine. I also had a conversation with another co-worker about my friends hesitancy and this co-worker just said he was a dumbass for not trusting the science. If that's a reoccurring thing across America then getting hesitant folks on board will be difficult. shaming people and wishing harm on those who are hesitant is not the way to go. I would put my money down on the majority of non vaccinated people that most are hesitant and not anti-vaccine, I may lose that bet, but if my experience and idea about with media, social and corporate, is right then articles like to make mountains out of mole hills. I remember when Covid deaths were ""projected"" to be 20,000,000 by NBC articles.   


I suggest taking a step back, flush away the aggravation you (the collective, not you personally) have with unvaccinated people. if someone says they are skeptical, tell them your story with any side effects you experienced. don't push it, people still like to make their own decisions. but give them something to think about. guaranteed if we all stop shaming everyone, vaccination numbers will have a little spike. We are now at 72.4% of people over the age of 12 that have received at least 1 does, 61.5% are fully vaccinated, 1.08 M second doses have been given since Aug. 13th and something like 900,000 vaccines are given a day (though that number is probably different now)

Your body has many layers of defenses - front line cells that literally *eat* invaders, berserkers that go scorched earth on the entire area vomiting poison everywhere, automated protein landmines that flag invaders as foreign and tear holes in them, intelligence cells that decorate themselves in bits of the enemy and carry them off for study, tactical cells that instruct soldiers to fight harder (or not, if the fight is over), inspector cells that literally order infected cells to kill themselves, weapons factories that do nothing but pump out antibodies, and many more.

Immunity is gained *if* you reach the point of activating B cells, the ""heavy weapons platform"" of the body that pump out antibodies. But if your front lines are able to contain an infection, your body doesn't bother with antibodies - they're expensive, and there's no reason to make them if the invaders are so weak they can't even survive the macrophages and compliment system. And the B cells take about a week, give or take, to come online.

And the same really goes for an external treatment. From your body's perspective, that bacterial infection you killed with penicillin was just weak. And likewise, if you get a transfusion of COVID antibodies externally that gimps the infection and lets your body clean up (antibodies are more like handcuffs that restrain their target until it can't fight back or run away). So if you sweep the infection with medicine, you won't become immune because... why would you need to?

This was born purely out of necessity, and that time of need is *over*.

Purpose To determine the potential associations between physical activity and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe illness from COVID-19 and COVID-19 related death using a nationwide cohort from South Korea.  
  
Methods Data regarding 212 768 Korean adults (age ≥20 years), who tested for SARS-CoV-2, from 1 January 2020 to 30 May 2020, were obtained from the National Health Insurance Service of South Korea and further linked with the national general health examination from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019 to assess physical activity levels. SARS-CoV-2 positivity, severe COVID-19 illness and COVID-19 related death were the main outcomes. The observation period was between 1 January 2020 and 31 July 2020.  
  
Results Out of 76 395 participants who completed the general health examination and were tested for SARS-CoV-2, 2295 (3.0%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 446 (0.58%) had severe illness from COVID-19 and 45 (0.059%) died from COVID-19. Adults who engaged in both aerobic and muscle strengthening activities according to the 2018 physical activity guidelines had a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (2.6% vs 3.1%; adjusted relative risk (aRR), 0.85; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96), severe COVID-19 illness (0.35% vs 0.66%; aRR 0.42; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.91) and COVID-19 related death (0.02% vs 0.08%; aRR 0.24; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.99) than those who engaged in insufficient aerobic and muscle strengthening activities. Furthermore, the recommended range of metabolic equivalent task (MET; 500–1000 MET min/week) was associated with the maximum beneficial effect size for reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (aRR 0.78; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.92), severe COVID-19 illness (aRR 0.62; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.90) and COVID-19 related death (aRR 0.17; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.98). Similar patterns of association were observed in different sensitivity analyses.  
  
Conclusion Adults who engaged in the recommended levels of physical activity were associated with a decreased likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe COVID-19 illness and COVID-19 related death. Our findings suggest that engaging in physical activity has substantial public health value and demonstrates potential benefits to combat COVID-19.",,,,1630593360,{},hbbk1m8,True,t3_pgj4tm,False,False,t3_pgj4tm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pgj4tm/physical_activity_and_the_risk_of_sarscov2/hbbk1m8/,1630675056.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,binary__dragon,,,[],,,,text,t2_l6ecmlg,False,False,[],"It's complex. The virus works by having some special spike proteins on its surface that bind to the ACE2 receptors on your cell walls. These spike proteins then interact with other things on your cell walls to allow itself it enter the cell in a manner than makes it harder for your immune system to prevent (I'm glossing over a lot of complex details here). The vaccines work by causing our bodies to produce this spike protein, which is by itself harmless, teaching our immune systems to be able to combat them if they see them again, before the virus can actually infect a cell.

So say the virus mutates to have a slightly different spike protein. Our bodies won't recognize it as easily, and so it has a greater chance of reaching a cell to infect. But, at the same time, than change is likely to inhibit how readily the spike protein can bind to your ACE2 receptor, and thus limit its infectiousness in that way.

But, that isn't a guarantee. It's possible that there can be mutations that both increase the ability for the virus to bind (such a mutation is what makes Delta more infectious than the OG virus), while also making the protein different enough to evade the immunity we have set up. The odds are lower for that - think of it like the odds of rolling a single 6 on a die vs rolling double 6's on a pair of dice. The virus has to essentially get lucky with its mutation in two ways at once for this to happen, and that's not nearly as likely as it getting lucky in only one of the two ways.

His podcast with Bill Burr is where I believe he made the silly statements against the masks (and added to the general anti-vaxx sentiment). But what Bill Burr said is fucking spot on....I have a ton of respect for someone that can say I am not an expert on this but I am willing to listen to the people who ARE experts on that. Medical professionals, epidemiologists, virologists, etc. I have a bachelor's in Biology and I do NOT consider myself an expert in anything in that field. I do my research and check sources and what not, but if I am not sure on specific subject in a scientific discipline I check the research and data of people that commit their lives to that subject. It applies to almost any subject. Kind of a bad example but I don't know shit about plumbing....am I going to just take a Facebook post or headline at face value for how I should fix or maintain my home's plumbing? No. I am going to listen to what actual professionals who work in that field and take their advice, not just look at 5 memes and treat them as literal factual data lol.

Here is the clip of part of that Bill Burr episode: **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1chYhsp3NRw**

We need more people that have the mindset of Bill Burr. We will never know everything individually and it's okay to be wrong, but it's also okay to admit we are not an expert in certain subjects and that we should probbbbably pay attention to the people who are, especially if the majority of them agree on masks (within limits), vaccination, etc. And not just their voices, but their data, does it follow the scientific method? Is their use of statistics or data fair and unbiased? Is it empirically based? etc. It's not easy to read through scientific literature or data of even subjects that some people find to be easy. But it's not that hard over time to train yourself to be able to tell when a headline or article is full of shit or clickbait...always check your sources, read the language they use, the data they use, etc.",,,,1630610590,{},hbcqu5w,False,t3_pgd78x,False,True,t1_hbcoct9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pgd78x/joe_rogan_says_he_has_covid_took_widely/hbcqu5w/,1630699055.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;As noted, the activity of ivermectin in cell culture has not reproduced in mouse infection models against many of the viruses and has not been clinically proven either, in spite of ivermectin being available globally. This is likely related to the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic safety window for ivermectin. **The blood levels of ivermectin at safe therapeutic doses are in the 20–80 ng/ml range \[44\], while the activity against SARS-CoV2 in cell culture is in the microgram range.** Ivermectin is administered orally or topically. If safe formulations or analogs can be derived that can be administered to achieve therapeutic concentrations, ivermectin could be useful as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent.

First off, any research showing that Ivermectin works on a virus is being done in a lab with samples and has not been reproduced in mouse infection models and definitely not in humans.

Second, the amount of Ivermectin that is needed to impact any number of viruses was at a level far higher than what the human body can safely tolerate. Note, ng/ml is a billionth of a gram, microgram is a millionth of a gram. A lot of research is needed into making sure that the Ivermectin can be safely targeted to the virus without creating a toxic build up in the human body.

For the vaccinated, nobody knows at this point how many become asymptomatic or instead simply repel the virus.

Also early in the pandemic, people started noticing that what the layman thought of the word ""mild"" was not at all what epidemiologists meant when they said it. Mild simply meant ""You won't go to the hospital, but actually you still might, but your life won't be truly threatened."" You might be the sickest you've ever been in your life, but you can still be classified as having a ""mild"" case.

And all along we've heard about long covid. Estimates range from 10-30% of cases being long covid, but the thing that I find gets reported the least reliably is what exactly that means. If you lose your sense of smell, and two months later you're totally recovered from covid but your sense of smell has only returned ~50%, that's long covid by some definitions.

Dr Liz Whittaker, another of the study’s authors and a senior clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Imperial College London, said: “Most of the young people that we’ve seen were symptomatic, but they’re very mildly symptomatic.

Think about the list of symptoms ""associated with coronavirus"" - it includes headaches, fatigue, congestion, also all of the common respiratory symptoms also associated with allergies, etc.

I'm not on a great sleep schedule right now so I'm feeling very fatigued.  I also am relatively allergic to grass this time of year, so I have pretty bad congestion and then subsequent headaches if I forget to take my allergy medications.

So, if you are a parent who works for the state and have no other reliable child care option, that's tough because it isn't their responsibility to make sure you specifically have childcare. And on top of that, they aren't amending the reasonable accommodations to include childcare or care for elders or ones with illness. The only amended period was a 3 month period, right before the return to work proposal which starts on the 7th. So for the whole entire period of lockdown and telecommuting, only the past 3 months was it ok to be approved to 100% telecommute for childcare. That to me is not taking your workers best interests in mind. Especially now when kids are being hit hard, and they are pulling people back with no proof of vaccination or mandate for one? Just the honor system and string suggestions to get the vaccine. They are asking us to put our job before our safety and the safety of our families and it feels really shitty just accepting that as ""policy"".

 This lockdown thing has been going on and off for over a year now. Given that my older one is a little over four, it's 1/4th of his life - and probably 1/2 of his sentient life. School is only part of it - people are very reluctant about playdates, a lot of after-school activities are shut down, and he *badly* wants to meet other kids, to the point that going to visit someone, when I can arrange it, is the best reward I can possibly give out.

 It's a bit better with my kids, because I have two of a similar age, and they at least play with each other. Some other kids at the playground are not only miserable, but lack social skills to the point of *WTF?* 

 What's more, there is no kids' media, whatsoever, to explain what's going on. Paw Patrol pups don't wear masks, don't socially distance, and don't freak out about strangers. Actual people do all of the above. 

 Finally, why everyone is trying to egg on school and kids, while there are tons of unvaccinated 18-29 year olds screwing around at pubs, concerts and the like?

Difference is, when my amazon driver slips on my icy steps in January and fucks up his back for life, he's kicked to the curb, but when a cop does the same thing, he gets to ride out his career behind a desk and receive his pension for life.   


For curiosity, i also ran the figures for loggers, and the injury incidence rate is 1,344 per 100,000. So you're a third as likely to get injured and survive, but 10 times more likely to die on the job than a police officer.",,,,1630536595,{},hb8vjkh,False,t3_pfwb1h,False,False,t1_hb8m9vg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pfwb1h/funeral_for_police_officer_who_refused_vaccine/hb8vjkh/,1630626332.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

A part of me thinks it's a great idea, given the close proximity of in person classes and dorm living, not to mention students will be students and not be careful when partying. Another part of me wonders what the repercussion would be if people do die from the vaccine after a mandate, and the field day anti vaxxers will have with that. I know a handful of people who have their own reasons, separate from political ones, to not get vaccinated. They still mask up and are considerate with others, and I feel bad for them. It makes it hard to blindly label everyone who doesn't vaccinate as a moron who deserves to get sick, which is a response from most people I know.

I went from a guy who never spent a dime on music to easily spending hundreds directly supporting artists as a direct result of Spotify. I think the thing you have to be critical of with the ""boo Spotify"" narrative is that it's mostly being brigaded by a parasitic recording industry who is sad that they can no longer make big bucks selling CDs like they did in the late 90s.
