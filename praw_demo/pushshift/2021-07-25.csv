I do. Can't imagine there are that many people left in the USA who don't given the sheer amount of reporting on said cases.

&gt;The above poster is most worried about breakthrough cases because it's plausible (likely? guaranteed?) that they will create an evolutionary pressure (or whatever you want to call it) towards variants that evade the vaccines more and more. His theory is that having a split population like the US is much better breeding grounds for variants that will evade the vaccine than locations with basically no one vaccinated where the dominant variants will become whatever is most effective against unvaccinated people and anything that's ultra effective won't have any real advantage over variants without that boon

The thing is, my friend was worrying too much about her mom (who had mental problems and was suicidal) and now my friend was free and at peace.

My predicion is that people who have stressful lives are the long haulers. Stress causes the nervous system to sensitize and not work properly to heal the body. The body is burnt out.

So, destressing (and knowing how you've been stressing yourself) is important.

The anti-vax people are emotional people and stress their body because of all the fears they have. So it's not only because they didn't vaccinate that cause so much death, it's because their nervous system is dysfunctional and can't work properly.

&gt;Abstract

&gt;Background: The period from February to June 2021 was one during which initial wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strains were supplanted in Ontario, Canada, first by variants of concern (VOC) with the N501Y mutation (Alpha/B1.1.17, Beta/B.1.351 and Gamma/P.1 variants), and then by the Delta/B.1.617 variant. The increased transmissibility of these VOCs has been documented but data for increased virulence is limited. We used Ontario COVID-19 case data to evaluate the virulence of these VOCs compared to non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 infections, as measured by risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death. Methods: We created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontarios testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and screened for VOCs, with dates of test report between February 7 and June 22, 2021 (n=211,197). We constructed mixed effects logistic regression models with hospitalization, ICU admission, and death as outcome variables. Models were adjusted for age, sex, time, comorbidities, and pregnancy status. Health units were included as random intercepts. Results: Compared to non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, the adjusted elevation in risk associated with N501Y-positive variants was 59% (49-69%) for hospitalization; 105% (82-134%) for ICU admission; and 61% (40-87%) for death. **Increases with Delta variant were more pronounced: 120% (93-153%) for hospitalization; 287% (198-399%) for ICU admission; and 137% (50-230%) for death. Interpretation: The progressive increase in transmissibility and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs will result in a significantly larger, and more deadly, pandemic than would have occurred in the absence of VOC emergence.**",,,,1627289068,{},h6ketus,False,t3_ork0oh,False,False,t1_h6j6vxf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ork0oh/doctors_warn_about_slightly_different_symptoms/h6ketus/,1627424781,13,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_l796l,False,False,,

Unfortunately, darker skinned people absorb Vitamin D from sunlight a lot slower than lighter skinned people.  Most people don't spend enough time outside to get an appropriate level of Vitamin D from sunlight (so for black people this is kind of genetic/evolutionary as the warm climate in Africa had our ancestors outside throughout the year; white people in the north were dealing with winter and being inside more), and should be supplementing with Vitamin D3 (4000IU is considered safe for long term though you will find many supplements at 5000IU, which is going to be fine for quite a while), Magnesium (Glycinate, Malate, Taurate are good options, stay away from Oxide), and K2/MK7; these work synergistically, Magnesium helps absorption of D3, K2/MK7 helps your body get it to the right spots.

Zinc is also helpful (but depletes copper, so supplement with that from time to time as well or eat some orange vegetables like carrots or peppers), as well as NAC for stimulating glutathione production, your body's master antioxidant, which covid creates a lot of oxidative stress in your body.

Going by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/i7y7io/myocarditis_is_this_something_really_risky_and/g166ha0/) old comment, it seems that Myocarditis can cause an increase in risk of heart disease.  Is that only from more severe cases of Myocarditis? My impression was that more severe cases determine the repercussions now, but the long term effects are still unknown - even when patients are out of the hospital. I am in no way in the field though so that assumption may be wrong.

I just don't understand - why not give AZ or J&amp;J to young men who are most at risk? 1/5000 is still fantastic odds by I personally already know 2 people (and my friend group isn't large) who had medium-severe reactions to the Pfizer vaccine. While I'm fully vaccinated (and would do it again), my own father had a bad reaction to it, and part of me wonders how much of that is hereditary.

From September:

&gt;By the end of September, average margins across these four markets remained relatively high (and loss ratios relatively low or flat) compared to the same point in recent years. These findings suggest that many insurers have remained profitable even as both COVID-related and non-COVID care increased in the third quarter of 2020. The results for the individual and group markets continue to indicate that commercial insurers are going to owe substantial rebates to consumers again next year under the Affordable Care Act‚Äôs (ACA) Medical Loss Ratio provision. For Medicaid, application of risk sharing arrangements that many states have in place may ultimately reduce overall margins calculated in the quarterly data. https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-brief/health-insurer-financial-performance-through-september-2020/

[],,McCaffeteria,,,,,,[],"But the analogy *also* demonstrates that your belief is unfounded.

People wear sunscreen because they prefer the mild inconvenience of being slightly sticky to being burned. There is also a significant amount of people who appreciate the benefits of *not getting skin cancer* on top of not getting burned.

You are someone who sits there and claims ‚Äúonly people with thin skin get skin cancer, sunscreen is pointless.‚Äù You‚Äôre just wrong.

Healthy people get skin cancer and healthy people get covid, and healthy people die from both *all the time.* Sunscreen and the vaccine both have minimal impact on you, especially when compared to getting a sunburn or getting infected.

The vaccine comes with other unique benefits that you aren‚Äôt even considering. Covid, unlike sunburn, *is fucking contagious* and by getting the vaccine you help protect people who *do* have underlying health issues.

The vaccine, unlike sunscreen, is also *permanent* so you just physically don‚Äôt have the option to selectively only use sunscreen when you go outside. You have to make the choice ahead of time and for *all* weather types. Your analogy is intentionally incomplete because it‚Äôs inconvenient for you to admit that refusing the vaccine is *also* like refusing sunscreen when going to the beach just so that you don‚Äôt *also* have it at night, even though there‚Äôs no *downside* to having it at night as well. Sure, you don‚Äôt need sunscreen at night, but choosing to only use ‚Äúsunscreen‚Äù when you need it *isn‚Äôt a physical option due to biology* when it comes to covid.

You also aren‚Äôt considering the long term complications of contracting Covid. It‚Äôs not as simple as ‚Äúyou get sick for a week, and then you either die or are fine.‚Äù

You *also* aren‚Äôt considering the cost of having to use healthcare resources on people for no reason if they contract it, even if they survive, when the case was preventable. The way that you prevent infections is by inoculating people, and every infection you prevent lowers the chances of overloading the healthcare system. Were you under a rock during the whole flatten the curve thing? Did you learn nothing?

Let me put it this way: I don‚Äôt like sunscreen. It‚Äôs gross and it smells bad, having to reapply it is extra annoying, and when it gets in my eyes it‚Äôs really uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt even like to go outside in the first place, it‚Äôs hot and there are bugs and there‚Äôs not much to do out there that I find fun. I don‚Äôt use sunscreen unless I‚Äôm going to be literally in the sun all day and I know I‚Äôm gonna have a bad time if I don‚Äôt.

And yet, if there was a way to have the benefits of sunscreen permanently (maybe not even ‚Äúlifelong,‚Äù but mostly permanently), it was free even if I didn‚Äôt have sunscreen insurance, it was a quick and easy procedure, there were basically no downsides, and it meant I didn‚Äôt have to wear sunscreen or a hat on days I knew I was going to be in the sun, I‚Äôd get the fucking sunscreen vaccine.

I probably wouldn‚Äôt even go outside more and I probably wouldn‚Äôt have even needed the sunscreen vaccine, but *why the fuck would I not get it?*",,,,1627326479,{},h6mb14v,False,t3_orywgh,False,False,t1_h6m7qiv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/orywgh/if_you_are_not_vaccinated_against_covid19_you/h6mb14v/,1627460145,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_axo0l,False,False,,

[],,KinnerNevada,,,,,,[],"New York City will require all municipal workers to be vaccinated against the coronavirus by the time schools reopen in mid-September or face weekly testing, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday morning.

Last week, Mr. de Blasio announced a similar mandate for public health care workers ‚Äî part of an effort to speed up vaccinations as the city faces a third wave of coronavirus cases driven by the spread of the Delta variant.

The new requirement will apply to roughly 340,000 city workers, including teachers and police officers. The Sept. 13 deadline, when about a million students are set to return to classrooms, shows the importance of the reopening of schools for the city‚Äôs recovery and for Mr. de Blasio‚Äôs legacy.

Speaking at his morning news conference, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat in his final year in office,  also reiterated his call to private employers to set similar or stronger vaccine mandates for their workers.

‚ÄúSeptember is the pivot point of the recovery,‚Äù Mr. de Blasio said, ‚Äúand so on Sept. 13, the first day of school, every single city employee will be expected to be either vaccinated or be tested weekly.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wait,‚Äù said Dr. Dave Chokshi, the city‚Äôs health commissioner, calling on all city employees to get vaccinated sooner than the September deadline. ‚ÄúWe need stronger medicine to deal with Delta, and that‚Äôs why we are taking these steps today.‚Äù

Whether all the city‚Äôs unions will be fully on board with the new mandate remains an open question. Mr. de Blasio said he was acting out of a sense of urgency, so city officials had not yet spoken with all of the municipal unions involved.

Those the city had spoken with, he and other city officials said, had reacted positively. The United Federation of Teachers signaled its approval on Monday.

‚ÄúThis approach puts the emphasis on vaccination, but still allows for personal choice and provides additional safeguards through regular testing,‚Äù Alison Gendar, a spokeswoman for the teachers‚Äô union, said in a statement.

The city‚Äôs largest public employees‚Äô union, however, said on Monday that there were still steps to be taken before it would consent to the testing requirement.

‚ÄúWeekly testing is clearly subject to mandatory bargaining,‚Äù Henry Garrido, the executive director of the union, DC37, said in a statement. ‚ÄúNew York City is a union town, and that cannot be ignored.‚Äù

Nearly five million New York City residents have received at least one dose of the vaccine, but the speed of inoculations has slowed. Two million adult New Yorkers are still unvaccinated. The number of virus cases has risen to more than 800 on average per day, more than triple the daily average in late June.

Mr. de Blasio was among the first big-city mayors to open schools for any in-person instruction last fall, and he announced in May that the city‚Äôs public schools would reopen for full-time live instruction in September, with no remote learning option. That made New York one of the first large school systems to declare a return to fully normal schooling for the coming academic year.

But parents and educators have expressed anxiety in recent weeks as the city‚Äôs average test-positivity rate has ticked up. Some parents say they are worried that the new school year will face major disruptions, as it did last year, and some teachers say they are concerned about returning to classrooms with cases rising.

The city‚Äôs education department estimates that around 60 percent of its employees are vaccinated, about the same rate as for employees at the city‚Äôs public hospitals. Vaccination rates appear to be lower in the police department, which has administered the vaccine to 43 percent of its members. The city‚Äôs fire department has roughly a 55 percent vaccination rate.

New York City‚Äôs vaccination rate as a whole is 65 percent for adults, better than the national average, but there are some neighborhoods where the rate is under 40 percent.  

City health and hospital employees must be vaccinated or get tested weekly starting  Aug. 2, the mayor announced.  On Aug. 16, 45,000 city employees who work in congregate or residential settings, like homeless shelters and senior centers, will have to do the same. The mandate for the rest of city employees goes into effect on the first day of the school year.

Mr. de Blasio said the city will reinforce a current rule requiring all unvaccinated employees to wear masks indoors at all times. The rule will now require people to show a one-time proof of vaccination to get out of that mask mandate.

The mayor also said the city is introducing a new ‚ÄúNYC Covid Safe‚Äù app to help employers keep track of vaccination status and weekly test results. New York State has an app, the Excelsior Pass, with a similar function.

Mr. de Blasio said the threat of the Delta variant made the new steps by the city necessary.

‚ÄúIf someone is unvaccinated, unfortunately, they pose a threat to themselves, but they also have a greater chance of spreading the disease,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSeptember is when the rubber hits the road, and this is when we have to make the difference.‚Äù",,,,1627318401,{},h6lsd0f,True,t3_os2unu,False,True,t3_os2unu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/os2unu/covid19_updates_new_york_will_require_vaccines_or/h6lsd0f/,1627450875,10,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_m76zflk,False,False,,

It looks like expecting these sorts of changes to go smoothly and have everyone be appreciative is not how it works.",,,,1627318185,{},h6lrv27,False,t3_orb6od,False,True,t1_h6kjjdp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/orb6od/many_americans_were_looking_forward_to_a_carefree/h6lrv27/,1627450631,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_9wtca,False,False,,

[],,POP_PRO,,,,,,[],"Hmm... Lost me initially with the link, but interesting idea... Veganism is growing for good reason. The more I think of it there is correlation. 

I'm all for the consumption of less meat in society and making it more expensive, may be a way to do just that. For both, encouraging people to get vaxed and to eat less meat.

I think giving people choice is best. Unfortunately or perhaps fortunately we are driven by our wallets. So if we charged those who are unvaccinated for corona testing to be able to take part in what many consider standard societal activities, then I believe many will choose to get vaccinated. Due to ppl being cheap and lazy. 

I think you can do the same with meat, just charge more for it and use that to subsidize the alternatives, lab meat and lentil burgers or whatever the latest awesome tasting option is. 

So yeah I think this could be applied across the board, even when considering climate change and veganism, not just our current distraction which is the coronavirus.

Hundreds of children in Indonesia have died from the coronavirus in recent weeks, many of them under age 5, a mortality rate greater than that of any other country and one that challenges the idea that children face minimal risk from Covid-19, doctors say.
The deaths, more than 100 a week this month, have come as Indonesia confronts its biggest surge yet in coronavirus cases over all ‚Äî and as its leaders face mounting criticism that they have been unprepared and slow to act.
‚ÄúOur numbers are the highest in the world,‚Äù the head of the Indonesian Pediatric Society, Dr. Aman Bhakti Pulungan, said of the death rate. ‚ÄúWhy are we not giving the best for our children?‚Äù
The jump in child deaths coincides with the surge of the Delta variant, which has swept through Southeast Asia, where vaccination rates are low, causing record outbreaks not only in Indonesia, but in Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar and Vietnam as well.

In donesia, the world‚Äôs fourth-most populous nation, this month overtook India and Brazil in the number of daily cases, becoming the new epicenter of the pandemic. The government reported nearly 50,000 new infections and 1,566 deaths among the entire population on Friday.
Based on reports from pediatricians, children now make up 12.5 percent of the country‚Äôs confirmed cases, an increase over previous months, said Dr. Aman, executive director of the pediatric association. More than 150 children died from Covid-19 during the week of July 12 alone, he said, with half the recent deaths involving those younger than 5.

Over all, Indonesia has reported more than three million cases and 83,000 deaths, but health experts say the actual figures are many times higher because testing has been very limited. Critics say the nation‚Äôs leaders have relegated health experts to a secondary role in combating the spread of the virus, even after the Delta variant devastated India earlier this year.

‚ÄúThe government has never taken this pandemic seriously from the beginning,‚Äù said Alexander Raymond Arifianto, a research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. ‚ÄúThe voice of the actual experts in how to best handle the pandemic is simply not being heard.‚Äù
On Sunday, Indonesia‚Äôs president, Joko Widodo, extended some restrictions on gatherings and commerce through Aug. 2 but relaxed others, such as allowing traditional markets to resume operating as usual with strict health protocols.
Mr. Joko, a former businessman who has been reluctant to impose lockdowns that slow the economy, had said he would begin lifting restrictions if case numbers declined.

‚ÄúWith our hard work together, God willing, we can soon be free from Covid 19 and the socio-economic activities of the community can return to normal,‚Äù he said Sunday evening.

More than 800 children in Indonesia under the age of 18 have died from the virus since the pandemic began, Dr. Aman said, but the majority of those deaths have occurred only in the past month.
‚ÄúUntil now, children have been the hidden victims of this pandemic,‚Äù said Dr. Yasir Arafat, Asia health adviser to the nonprofit group Save the Children. ‚ÄúNot anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot only are countries like Indonesia seeing record numbers of children dying from the virus,‚Äù Dr. Yasir said, ‚Äúbut we‚Äôre also seeing an alarming rise in children missing out on routine vaccinations and nutrition services that are critical for their survival, which should ring major alarm bells.‚Äù

Health experts said a number of factors contributed to the high number of deaths among children. Some could be vulnerable to the virus because of underlying health conditions such as malnutrition, obesity, diabetes and heart disease, doctors said.

The country‚Äôs low vaccination rate is another factor. Just 16 percent of Indonesians have received one dose and only 6 percent have been fully vaccinated, according to the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford. Like other countries, Indonesia does not vaccinate children under 12 and only recently began vaccinating those between 12 and 18.
At the same time, many hospitals have been stretched beyond their limit by the recent surge in cases, with patients waiting in hallways and overflow tents for a bed in a ward to open. Few hospitals are set up to care for children with Covid.

If the children get sick, where are we going to take them?‚Äù Dr. Aman asked. ‚ÄúTo the emergency room? Emergency wards are overwhelmed with adults. And as you have seen for the past couple of weeks, people have to wait at the emergency room for days. How do we expect children to go through that?‚Äù

With hospitals at capacity, about two-thirds of adult patients are in isolation at home, which increases the chance that children will be infected, said Edhie Rahmat, executive director for Indonesia at the nonprofit health-care group Project HOPE.
Infants are also put at risk by the tradition of friends and neighbors visiting a newborn‚Äôs home to celebrate the birth, he said.
‚ÄúThese newborns are being released from hospitals with negative Covid-19 status, but later contracting Covid-19 and dying after being visited by neighbors and extended family members,‚Äù Mr. Edhie said. ‚ÄúIt is heartbreaking.‚Äù

Dr. Aman said educating the public and getting more people to comply with health protocols would be a good start in protecting children.
‚ÄúIt all goes back to the adults,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe adults are the stubborn ones. They refuse to wear a mask. They bring their children to crowded places.‚Äù

Indonesia, a vast archipelago of 17,500 islands, also ranks in the bottom third among nations in testing, said Dr. Windhu Purnomo, a lecturer in epidemiology at Airlangga University in Surabaya.

The country‚Äôs health minister, Budi Gunadi Sadikin, has set a goal of 400,000 tests a day. But the country has never come close to that figure. Last week, the number dipped below 115,000.
Positive tests are averaging more than 30 percent, a sign that the virus is spreading rapidly and that not enough tests are being conducted. The World Health Organization recommends a positivity rate below 5 percent.
‚ÄúIf we evaluate these numbers, this means that the emergency restrictions haven‚Äôt been working,‚Äù Dr. Windhu said.
Luhut Pandjaitan, the coordinating minister for maritime affairs and investment and perhaps Mr. Joko‚Äôs most trusted adviser, is leading the country‚Äôs Covid-19 response. He pledged last week that the government would increase testing and tracing and provide more isolation centers, especially in densely populated neighborhoods.

 I should have knew better than to post in this sub, it has become way too polarized and is full of a lot of people that have one dimensional thinking.

Well no, for one just like we don't have numbers for infections of those who never got tested, those same people probably didn't report a reinfection.

Here's an [article/video](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/how-does-natural-covid-immunity-compare-to-the-vaccine/ar-AAMcONx) on the question about natural immunity vs vaccine. One of the points made is that it seems for a severe infection (that leaves you in the hospital) vs a mild infection, the future immune response is better/stronger for defending against covid (kind of like you only exercised the front-line troops in the mild infection). 

One point they *didn't* make though is that the majority of people *don't* end up in the hospital, so I'm dubious about both people relying on past infection for immunity and also that we have good numbers on reinfections.  

They also talk about how much a wild card variants are. We don't yet know how well natural immunity helps against them, while we do have a good idea on vaccines.

Lockdowns and masks mitigated it early on because that was the best we could do at the time, but lockdowns now to an extent is a failure on the government. Also lockdowns will wreck the economy and takes toll on mental health and not a feasible option for an endgame. 

Covid is with us at this point and spread too well to where it's highly unlikely to be eradicated at least in the short run. The best thing to do at this point is keep pushing vaccine efforts as endless lockdowns and mask mandates (at least for places like the US where the vaccine is abundantly available) this far in is not effective and will just piss people off. People have had enough of the restrictions and ready to get back to their lives. As somebody who is fully vaccinated, it's frustrating to see that we get punished for doing what's right because Joe the Anti-vaxxer choose to not get it and overall sends a mixed message for people who are on the fence of getting the vaccine because they may see no benefit to them.

Up-to-date information on the number of COVID-19 cases, including those without clinical manifestations, is daily reported by the Operational Headquarters to prevent the importation and spread of a new coronavirus infection in Russia and is published in the public domain on the stopkoronavirus.ru website. As of July 15, 2021, 5,882,295 cases of COVID-19 were registered in Russia.  


  
The Ministry of Health, to a clarifying question about the register of those who had been ill, replied that the commentary of the headquarters reflects their position as well. According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Health, ""the only thing that this figure \[27 million\] looks like is the number of people vaccinated with the first component as of July 9th."" And to assess the number of cases, he urged to focus only on the daily reports of the operational headquarters.

  
That is, the federal headquarters for the fight against coronavirus and the Ministry of Health suggested that, asking a question about 27 million records, journalists confused the registers of those who had been ill and vaccinated.  
But this is not the case, and this can be seen in the anonymized screenshot of the certificate of a person who recovered from covid on February 18, 2021.  


  
The number of his certificate cannot be taken from the register of vaccinated in any way simply because at that time there were several times less vaccinated in the country. The serial number in this certificate is 17 million, and by mid-February only 11 million doses of vaccines were produced in Russia and  about four million people were vaccinated .  


  
If we assume that the number of the patient's certificate closely reflects the number of cases of covid in the country, then an indicator of 29 million cases would lead Russia to the third place in the world in the absolute number of cases of coronavirus. In terms of a million inhabitants, the country would rise from 85th place to first, ahead of even the small states of Andorra and Seychelles.

&amp;#x200B;

  
Update. After the publication of the text, a reader contacted Mediazona, who in July 2021, due to an error on the State Services website, received a certificate from COVID-19, although he was sick with coronavirus back in April 2020. As proof, he provided the editorial board with a screenshot of this certificate and a letter from Gosuslug, which indicates the date of his recovery - the dates on these documents coincide, and this is May 2020.

Not a perfect study by any means.

And there is also the possibility of over adjusting variables. Controlling for weight is a prime example.

Animal products are more calorie dense when compared to plant protein. 900-1100 calories per pound from meat and milk compared to 500-700 calories per pound for beans and starches. If you make up most of your main portions from animals you‚Äôll probably be eating more calories than people who eat mostly unprocessed plants.

So if you control for weight you‚Äôll be over controlling since animal based diets tend to include more calories. Now processed foods and processed oils are the most calorie dense, thus it‚Äôd be helpful to sort it out further.

Same can be true for diabetes. Eating chicken just once or twice a meat was associated with higher diabetes rates in the Nurses Health Study. So if you control for diabetes you could have an incomplete picture.

Same is true for controlling for blood pressure when looking at salt intake and mortality.  There are ways to obscure the effect by controlling for moderators.

If animal products -&gt; increased calories -&gt; higher BMI -&gt; worse covid outcomes. Then controlling for BMI would break the chain and obscure the results. 

Agreed the study isn‚Äôt perfect, I‚Äôd like to see more detail on foods consumed too!

If you cannot vaccinate for whatever reason, such as a medical reason, be prepared to jump through some hoops. Fair enough during a pandemic.
Like taking an instant covid19 test. Which by in large, are fast and accurate.
Blanket discrimination for those who cannot vaccinate or just simply unwilling is not the answer. 
Not everyone who doesn't get the vaccines are anti-vaxxers.
I cannot be vaccinated due to a medical condition. Not because I'm simply unwilling.
I've never had an issue with wearing a mask, temp checks or even taking the rapid covid19 test. Which I've done many times already. It is what it is.
I do my part where and when I must.
Is it really fair to deny me the privilege of attending a concert or enjoy a movie at a theatre again, because of my condition?
Wouldn't that be unfairly discriminatory ?

The actual result is as follows:

&gt;4 of 109 seropositive children (4%) vs 28 of 1246 seronegative ones (2%) reported at least 1 symptom lasting beyond 12 weeks (see Table for all symptoms lasting beyond 4 and 12 weeks). The most frequently reported symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks among seropositive children were tiredness (3/109, 3%), difficulty concentrating (2/109, 2%), and increased need for sleep (2/109, 2%). None of the seropositive children reported hospitalization after October 2020. Similar proportions of seropositive and seronegative children reported excellent or good health.

It's still not a very big study, but 4% of previously infected children (seropositive) reported long-lasting symptoms vs 2% of never-infected children (seronegative). The symptoms included common stuff like tiredness and difficulty concentrating, so it's good that this study had a ""control group"" on uninfected children. The 4% is not significantly different than than the 2%.

The earlier Italian study that reported the 27% had no such control group. The most common long-lasting syndrome was insomnia, which may have cultural confounding issues as Italian kids generally don't have set bedtimes and go to sleep when their parents do. 

The [0% study was an Australian study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00124-3/fulltext) where 155 out of 155 children were back to baseline health status upon follow-up 3-6 months later.

Yes, Rosstat reports late (in June the publish the report for April, in July for May etc), because they wait for the data from civil register to arrive (say, if one was born or died on 31th of May then the certificate was issued in June but the event should go to the May report), still they correct the past reports when publishing a new one because sometimes the data arrives very late (although those are low number that don't affect the general trend).

While the early days of the pandemic showed that the ""it's just a flu bro"" minimalism was flat out wrong, the fact is that if we vaccinate enough, it actually *does* render the virus so much less effective that it basically becomes at worse a cold/flu level event. Maybe even less so.

The UK is showing that we can break the ""link"" between high case load and unreasonably high death totals. The Delta surge  (which seems to already be fading over there) never had  even close to the hospitalizations/deaths they had during the pre vaccination surges.

[],,benh999,,,,,,[],"Taipei, July 26 (CNA) Taiwan reported 11 new COVID-19 infections but no deaths from the disease on Monday, the second consecutive day nobody in the country was reported to have died of the disease, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).

Of the 11 cases, 10 were domestically transmitted -- four were reported in Taipei and three each originated in New Taipei and Taoyuan, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (Èô≥ÊôÇ‰∏≠), who heads the CECC, said at the CECC's daily briefing.

The 10 patients consisted of seven men and three women in their 20s to 70s. Five tested positive during home isolation or at the end of their home quarantines after developing symptoms between July 19 and 25, Chen said.

One of the 10 domestic cases has an unknown source, and another is still being investigated, he said.

The one case contracted overseas involved a Taiwanese man in his 50s who worked on a fishing boat, Chen said.

The boat departed from Taiwan on June 22 and when it returned on July 20, it was found to have eight stowaways on board -- six from Indonesia and two from Myanmar.

All people on the boat received COVID-19 tests, and while the Taiwanese man tested negative at that time, he was taken to a government-run quarantine center to be isolated because six others on the boat tested positive, according to the CECC.

The man began to experience a scratchy throat on July 25, so he got tested again, and the results came back positive on Monday, the CECC said.

Chen said the man was determined to have contracted the disease on the fishing boat on the high seas, and his case was therefore classified as imported.

The new cases bring the total in the country to 15,582, of which 14,108 are domestic infections reported since May 15, when Taiwan first recorded more than 100 COVID-19 cases in a single day.

To date, 786 people have died of COVID-19 in Taiwan, including 774 since May 15.

There is absolutely nothing rational about it.

My first BA was in psychology, so I spent most of my upper level coursework tearing apart research papers. It taught me how to research effectively with a healthy amount of skepticism.

There are so many data issues and questions with covid that it's hard to draw any real conclusions from it.  But the UK has something like 55% fully vaccinated, and about 10% infected and recovered.  It's commonly agreed that ""true"" infections are about 4 times higher than what's reported in high-testing countries like the UK, so it's probably close to 40% infected.  If you assume (admittedly based on nothing) that about half of that is overlap (recovered and also later vaccinated), then the country would be at about 75% immunity - right around the number that was theorized all along as the herd immunity threshold for covid.  And their covid metrics behaved like you would expect in a country that's roughly herd immune.

But that was before delta.  Delta is more contagious, and the contagiousness of the disease is a major variable in the herd immunity equation.  So all of a sudden, that 75% immunity became insufficient.  They were no longer herd immune.  But presumably still not terribly far off it, right?  How much more immunity is required?  Looking at the numbers from the UK, their uptrend started picking up steam about a month and a half ago.  Since that time, they've had about 1.2 million cases reported.  Using that same 4x idea, that'd be just about 5 million cases in reality - around 7.5% of the population of the country.  They also vaccinated something like another 1% of their population in that time.  

So maybe it's simply that the herd immunity level required for the Delta variant is something like 9 or 10% higher than for the previous ones?",,,,1627330504,{},h6mk3cx,False,t3_os16q4,False,False,t1_h6lqfto,/r/Coronavirus/comments/os16q4/covid19_uk_reports_24950_new_coronavirus_cases/h6mk3cx/,1627464588,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_m0d0v,False,False,,

**Abstract**  
Currently approved viral vector-based and mRNA-based vaccine approaches against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) consider only homologous prime-boost vaccination. After reports of thromboembolic events, several European governments recommended using AstraZeneca‚Äôs ChAdOx1-nCov-19 (ChAd) only in individuals older than 60 years, leaving millions of already ChAd-primed individuals with the decision to receive either a second shot of ChAd or a heterologous boost with mRNA-based vaccines. However, such combinations have not been tested so far. We used Hannover Medical School‚Äôs COVID-19 Contact Study cohort of healthcare professionals to monitor ChAd-primed immune responses before and 3 weeks after booster with ChAd (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ32) or BioNTech/Pfizer‚Äôs BNT162b2 (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ55). Although both vaccines boosted prime-induced immunity, BNT162b2 induced significantly higher frequencies of spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and, in particular, high titers of neutralizing antibodies against the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 variants of concern of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.",,,,1627329800,{},h6mihz3,False,t3_os4pv3,False,False,t1_h6mh64h,/r/Coronavirus/comments/os4pv3/immune_responses_against_sarscov2_variants_after/h6mihz3/,1627463786,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_tyrm2,False,False,,

The vaccine trains your immune system to catch the virus earlier. The earlier and faster your immune system catches and kills virus particles, the less damage the virus will do to your lungs and less chance you'll die by drowning in your own fluids. 

The vaccine both increases the quantity and quality of your immune response to the virus (more antibodies and also specialized antibodies that recognize the virus quicker). 

It's like being the US Special Forces vs someone who just passed boot camp. When faced with the enemy they both know how to fire a gun, but which one do you want in your side? If somebody is shooting at you would you rather have one soldier on your side or 20?

No mask and no distancing is just the highest risk.

I will also add that I appreciate your skepticism, but IMO, you make mistakes that many skeptical people (myself included) make when confronted with a decision or policy that doesn‚Äôt seem sensible based on what you know. One is a tendency to assume the intent of the decision or policy. Often, this assumption is informed by conscious or unconscious biases. Second is to assume that you know the processes, discussions and evidence that went into the policy or decision. Third is that you may not consider other possible explanations for the decision or policy. 

I have done this many times only to learn that the people involved in the decision or policy were looking at it on a level far deeper than I had imagine and were weighing possible complicating factors and other  things that I had not even thought of. But of course that doesn‚Äôt stop me from getting annoyed by what seem on the surface to be stupid decisions or policy. 

Okay, here the text and the link. 

‚ÄúOur review of the literature offers evidence in favor of widespread mask use as source control to reduce community transmission: Nonmedical masks use materials that obstruct particles of the necessary size; people are most infectious in the initial period postinfection, where it is common to have few or no symptoms (45, 46, 141); nonmedical masks have been effective in reducing transmission of respiratory viruses; and places and time periods where mask usage is required or widespread have shown substantially lower community transmission.

The available evidence suggests that near-universal adoption of nonmedical masks when out in public, in combination with complementary public health measures, could successfully reduce Re
 to below 1, thereby reducing community spread if such measures are sustained. Economic analysis suggests that mask wearing mandates could add 1 trillion dollars to the US GDP (32, 34).

Models suggest that public mask wearing is most effective at reducing spread of the virus when compliance is high (39). We recommend that mask use requirements are implemented by governments, or, when governments do not, by organizations that provide public-facing services. Such mandates must be accompanied by measures to ensure access to masks, possibly including distribution and rationing mechanisms so that they do not become discriminatory. Given the value of the source control principle, especially for presymptomatic people, it is not sufficient for only employees to wear masks; customers must wear masks as well.‚Äù

Wishful thinking, confirmation bias and the echo chamber effect.

Some people (for example, the majority of reddit's most prolific users, and the main target demographics for certain broadcasters) *want* to believe that they can blame r\*publicans for everything, so they pay more attention to information that confirms that idea and ignore information that doesn't. And when lots of people who think that way congregate in the same place, they can create their own version of reality because they all support each other's beliefs, giving each other the feeling that they are right, because everyone they talk to tells them so.

Conversely, the demographic that wants to blame r\*publicans for everything also tends to be very reluctant to say anything bad about anyone who's not white, so while they revel in stories about r\*publicans refusing vaccination, they'll avoid talking about black people doing the same thing, or make excuses for it (these excuses often display a lot of paternalistic racism and show that they see black people as lacking the ability to make up their minds and take responsibility for their decisions).",,,,1627250241,{},h6ioz23,False,t3_orezl4,False,True,t1_h6hulal,/r/Coronavirus/comments/orezl4/vaccine_stragglers_explain_hesitancy/h6ioz23/,1627390094,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_5ytfnepx,False,False,,

This is a whataboutism. Two things can be selfish at the same time. 

The difference, however, in a COVID context, would be that the anxious person views this as a *real* threat to themselves *and* you *and* others, and they're actually trying to protect *everyone*, not just themselves. They don't view it as irrational ‚Äî to them, what they're asking of others is something as rational as saying ""please don't drive drunk and endanger me,"" which I really don't think anyone would classify as a selfish request. 

In short, even if we grant that the anxious person is irrational, the difference is that the anxious person is making requests out of a very real *perceived* threat to themselves and to others, and the person who doesn't follow their requests is doing so purely out of self-interest and with disregard the fear and discomfort it may stir up in the anxious person. That's very different from someone who doesn't follow their requests in an effort to give them a degree of exposure therapy. The same action can be selfish or not depending on what the motivation is. 

Either way, I'm not arguing a specific situation here. I'm saying that the specific wording you used, abstracted from any specific circumstances, is basically the definition of being selfish.

[],,MauriceReeves,,,,,,[],"1. We actually probably have more than 4,5 mil deaths from this. That number is almost certainly an undercount because many places aren't able to provide an accurate total or are unwilling. Furthermore, just because someone is old and/or sick doesn't mean that their life is somehow less important or less meaningful or less worth protecting. In addition, the ages of the people who are being hospitalized and/or dying from COVID are younger than those who were dying from earlier strains. In fact the age band with the highest rates of infection now are between 15-45. Some places are reporting the median age of new infections is 35. While the rate of death isn't climbing yet, that can change as the more infectious delta variant pushes more people into hospitals and there is less access to care for people who will need things like oxygen and meds. So yeah, there is data on this, just no valid data that supports your argument. And again, why is it okay for someone who is 50 to die from COVID? 
2. Just because we will never reach 100% vaccination doesn't mean we shouldn't attempt to. We know we can't reach 100% because there are people who are not able to get the vaccine due to age or pre-existing condition, but the reason herd immunity works is because enough other people who can get the vaccine do, and that protects those who are most vulnerable.
3. That's literally how diseases work. The more a disease spreads in a community, the more it has a chance to mutate and each mutation has the possibility of making it more transmissible, more deadly, etc. That's what diseases do. That's the entire study of microbiology and virology. It's why there needs to be a new flu vaccine every year because it mutates and changes.

Finally, the vaccines have been approved. They have been tested. They've been proven to be effective, and there have been very few side effects. The reason most vaccines take longer to come out is for a few reasons:  
1. Lack of money  
2. Lack of manpower  
3. Competing interests  


In all of the cases above, they've been a non-issue because COVID is a global pandemic and has the focus of the world, and the resources of many governments backing it up. It's been a scientific all-hands-on-deck moment and government agencies and private businesses and scientific institutes and universities have all pitched in to do the work to get these vaccines out like they did because it's the only way to stop the spread and end the pandemic.   


Again, saying you're not going to take it even though the science is very clear that everyone needs to get vaccinated to keep the world safe is a very selfish decision on your part, and puts peoples lives at risk. If that's how you want to be, if you want to be selfish and tell yourself a bunch of crap to justify your poor decision making process, that's your prerogative, but don't for a second think that your actions only affect you. They don't. Your decision to not be vaccinated affects those in your community too. And what happens if you do get sick and suffer the consequences. Even then it's not just you who pays. Your long-term health care and everything that goes with it is paid for by the nation you live in, and you're asking everyone to pay up for your poor rationale to not get a vaccine.

&gt;A spotlight was put on the punishment after a report that Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians would fine a player ""$14,000 on the spot every time he isn't wearing a mask or is breaking a protocol.""

The $14K fine is for players breaking covid protocol. Vaccinated or not. Same as last year. This isnt nothing new. The ONLY thing that changes for vaccinated players is IF theres a team outbreak and they have been exposed they dont have to do the 5 day quarantine like the other players.

Three strategies were reported very consistently: consuming a low-calorie, low-fat diet, doing high levels of physical activity, and weighing themselves frequently. Recently, a fourth behavior was identified: consuming breakfast daily (13). Each of these behaviors is described below. Registry members reported eating 1381 kcal/d, with 24% of calories from fat. In interpreting their data, it is important to recognize that 55% of registry members report that they are still trying to lose weight and to consider that dietary intake is typically underestimated by 20‚Äì30%. Thus, registry members are probably eating closer to 1800 kcal/d. However, even with this adjustment, it is apparent that registry members maintain their weight loss by continuing to eat a low-calorie, low-fat diet.  
More recently, we have examined other aspects of their diet. Of particular interest is the fact that 78% of registry members report eating breakfast every day of the week (13).

[],,AdministrativePilot3,,,,,,[],"It turns out that when creating a certificate for a patient who has recovered, the ""Gosuslug"" portal simply takes its number from the Federal Register and adds the first eight to it (and vaccination certificates begin with the number 9). This is evidenced by the version of the certificate in a specialized JSON format, which can also be downloaded from Gosuslug: there is a 15-digit unrz field and a 16-digit unrzFull - with an eight in front, like the certificate number.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
But since the UNRZ in the Federal Register is formed during the registration of the disease (and then enters the certificate for the recovered), it turns out that the last eight digits in the certificate are the serial number of the sick person.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
Meduza's interlocutor in one of the regional ministries of health confirmed that the serial number in the register is the same throughout the country and reflects the total number of registered cases at the time of the creation of the NRM for each patient.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
125 thousand new cases per day  
Several dozen numbers of certificates and dates of recovery, which Sergei Shpilkin collected from volunteers, made it possible to assess the real scale of the epidemic over the past six months - ""older"" numbers on ""State Services"" are not available, since the QR code for a patient is formed only for the previous six months. But the most recent of the certificates sent - from a person who recovered at the end of June 2021 - has a serial number of 27 million 300 thousand. A source for Meduza in one of the federal agencies, familiar with the work of the Federal Register, when asked whether this figure corresponds to the number of entries in the register, replied: ‚ÄúIt is.‚Äù  


&amp;#x200B;

  
Now, As journalists from Meduza found out, the serial numbers of State Services' certificates for those who have been ill already exceed 29 million. This is almost five times more than the officially registered number of patients in the country during the pandemic - six million.

  
Since the certificate number is created at the moment when a person falls ill, and the certificate itself is issued only when he recovers, the number of today's certificate would show the number of entries in the register (that is, sick) that was observed two to three weeks ago. The certificate is created only after the person has recovered, but the number in this certificate refers to the moment of illness. Therefore, it is impossible to say exactly on what dates the peak of the appearance of new entries in the register fell. Officially, the maximum number of cases of coronavirus in Russia - 29,935 cases per day - was recorded on December 24, 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

  
Advertising  
""The register is filled out very honestly, but it is inaccurate""  
However, the number of entries in the Federal Register does not accurately reflect the number of people who have been ill. For example, if a person falls ill again, a new record is created for him. But that's not all.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
According to the  instructions of the Ministry of Health, not only people with a positive result of a ""laboratory test"" (meaning PCR and other tests), but also those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 ""using other diagnostic methods"" (according to the recommendations of the Ministry of Health, speech is about computed tomography). In addition, the register includes ‚Äúall pneumonia cases, including outpatient cases‚Äù.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
Journalists were unable to estimate the proportion of patients with pneumonia not related to coronavirus in the register. For statistics on the incidence of pneumonia without taking into account COVID-19, Mediazona turned to Rosstat, which has already provided such data for the first months of 2020. Now, the department replied that there is no longer a separate column on pneumonia in the data on the incidence coming from the Ministry of Health and Rospotrebnadzor.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
In addition, according to a Meduza source in one of the federal departments, the regions themselves determine how to maintain the register: to enter there only cases of coronavirus and pneumonia, or also doubtful cases of SARS, which can be up to 20-30% in the register.

&amp;#x200B;

  
‚ÄúThe register is filled out very honestly, but it is inaccurate,‚Äù explains the interlocutor, adding that at the federal level it is necessary to double-check the data from the regions.  
Another error that can arise when evaluating by the register number is due to the fact that patients whose initial diagnosis of COVID-19 has not been confirmed is removed from it, and the released serial number is then assigned to a new patient.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
Among the certificates that Sergei Shpilkin received, there are examples of inconsistency in the numbers. For example, a certificate with a serial number starting with 2327 was issued to a sick person in April 2021, and a number starting with 2376 was issued to a patient who had been ill in March.  
But this error only means that the specific number of the NRHZ may be less than the real number of cases in the registry.

&amp;#x200B;

  
""Information does not correspond to reality""  
At the request of the journalists of Mediazona to the Ministry of Digital Science (this ministry is responsible for the operation of the Russian portal ""State Services"") to confirm that the certificate number of the patient is formed on the basis of the UNRZ from the coronavirus register of the Ministry of Health, the press service of the Ministry of Digital Affairs replied that ""the portal"" State Services ""is a showcase of data contained in the register of COVID-19 patients operated by the Ministry of Health. ""  
""When generating the certificate, the register record of the Ministry of Health is used"", - said the press service in response to a request.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
Meduza and Mediazona appealed to the Ministry of Health and the federal operational headquarters for the fight against coronavirus with a request to comment on the number of entries in the register and how it differs from the official incidence reports. The headquarters was asked to provide their entire comment. There he is:

I switched jobs to help with mobile vaccine efforts; going to non-profit health care. I used to be the lead manager of a mass vaccine site that did 1600 people a day, then switched to doing mobile pop-up events in local stores and parks, and now I do community outreach where I go door to door to ask people to get vaccinated and to recommend others.

You know what I regularly got, and now receive even more?

Hate.

I got spit on, called a killer and murderer, that I was injecting poison into children. I got bottles thrown at me. Most people I talk to nowadays say they will only get the vaccine if the government forces them to, and some said that they'll have their gun on them if the government forces into their home. It's crazy... I had people rip up vaccine facts sheets in front of me and scatter them around our events for us to clean up. I've had people stand by us and debate us at length for how sinful we were.

At this point, I'm done with helping people. I feel I've done my part and helped as much as I can. I can't stand the amount of hate I get daily at my job; because trying to bring in people who don't want to get vaccinated just brings out the worst in them.

I'm so done.

People keep saying this but the UK has been getting hit pretty good with cases for over a month how.  If hospitalizations were going to spike significantly, we'd have seen it by now.    In places with high vaccination numbers, 50% and above, we're still seeing spikes in cases but hospitalizations and deaths are nowhere near the previous highs.

I think a big part of this is that the people most vulnerable to this virus, namely seniors, are vaccinated at high percentages.  Even in the US, over 80% of seniors in every single state have been fully vaccinated.   If the cases you're getting trend younger and younger, its only logical that hospitalizations and deaths won't be reaching previous levels.

This is what you're missing. In the situation you provided, the person isn't asking anyone to bow to their wishes, they're saying there is a serious threat to everyone, themselves included, i.e. it only relates to them in that they are part of everyone. Their ""demands"" are for the good of society as a whole. Your response, as you've presented it, is that you don't care what's good for others, you care what's good for you, and what you want to do for yourself.

As I said, something is selfish based on the motivation behind it, not the action itself. You can do the same exact thing and in one case it will be selfish, in another, it will not. If someone wants people to wear masks because they personally feel threatened, its selfish. If someone wants people to wear masks because they think *everyone* is threatened, it's not selfish. Similarly, if someone says that we *shouldn't* wear masks because it's better for *everyone* to be mask-free, it's not selfish, but if it's for one person, then it's selfish. You presented a view along the lines of the latter, i.e. *you* don't want to wear a mask, and you'll just do you regardless of how anyone else thinks or feels.

For example:

&gt;And what if I'm terrified of terrorist attacks and I demand that everyone getting on a plane needs to be strip searched to increase security?

Who's safety are you trying to protect? Yours alone? Everybody's? What if you're someone who doesn't fly and is worried about the safety of people who do fly ‚Äî in what way would that be selfish?

And again:

&gt;They just want to live their damn life, which they have every right to do.

Is this about *one person's* life, or is it about *everyone's* life? I.e., are you saying that you think that for society as a whole, it's important to have more freedom than the increased safety? Or is this just for your own personal enjoyment? If it's the former, it's not selfish, if it's the latter, it's selfish.

What you did is say that you can't call people selfish for saying that they only care about their own wants and desires.

[],,stirfriedaxon,,,,,,[],"I was traveling in Asia in 2020 when the pandemic started. By the third week of January 2020, all hotel and airline staff, also retail staff, wore masks and had hand sanitizers available everywhere. The general population there also wore masks without resistance - and no, this was not in China so no one was being ""forced"".

After arriving back Stateside at the end of January 2020, I saw the news with the CDC saying masks are ineffective in preventing transmission. This is accurate medical information? I think not. China was not forthcoming with data but there were other countries that had data regarding transmission pathways and contagiousness. At the same time, masks were already ""sold out"" everywhere in the US before Covid-19 was on the US population's radar, as if they had been sequestered by the government for healthcare workers' use. It seems to me that the CDC told the general population that masks were ineffective in order to provide them to healthcare workers. The CDC had months to plan (data from Asia, Europe) and react before the pandemic really ramped up in the US and failed miserably. 

I fail to see how saying ""no masks if vaccinated"" was a responsible strategy when the data consistently shows a large percentage of Americans are resistant to wearing masks and/or getting vaccinated. It is more logical to conclude ""those who resist masks will also resist vaccines"" than ""those who resist masks will get vaccinated to avoid masks"". Now we have maskless non-vaccinated people making the situation worse for everyone.

Your reply said NZ's experience wasn't representative.  You didn't say lockdowns have failed in NZ too.  So either you accept lockdowns work for NZ, or your previous reply doesn't make sense.  

&gt;And that's economic hardship that follows for ALOT of people. I've experienced and witnessed it first hand where I'm from. I seen small business closed shop, employees laid off, lose homes, etc

In both NZ and Australia the govt totally subsidised businesses so they would not shut and would not lay-off workers.  After the lockdowns business bounced back with both NZ and Australia having some of the best economic performance and lowest unemployment in the developed world now.  

In NZ we have had a total of 6 weeks of national lockdown and 3 weeks of Auckland-only lockdown in the 18 months of pandemic.  The whole rest of the time there has been zero restrictions. We don't even wear masks.  No capacity limits of any kind.  Since people can't travel overseas they have spent way more money on domestic travel and retail, keeping the economy strong.  The housing market is booming.  

&gt;Obviously from what I can see, lockdowns haven't been a success in Australia.

What?  They've been incredibly successful in every Australian state except NSW, which was the sole anti-lockdown state.  Victoria and South Australia will end theirs at midnight tomorrow.  Western Australia is already back to normal and has been for weeks.  All of them have totally stopped previous outbreaks with a 3 to 7 day lockdown, then gone on to live normally for months at a time.  

They've now had two major outbreaks both caused by a failure to lockdown.  Melbourne last year and now Sydney.  Melbourne learnt their lesson well, but Sydney didn't learn from them for political reasons.  

&gt;As I said earlier, lockdowns are not the best approach to this pandemic. It's been quite obvious for awhile now

It's been obvious that they are the best approach in any country able to control its borders.  But, and this is absolutely key, they only work if you do it immediately, when you have just a handful of cases.  Europe and North America never had a chance, there was already to much virus spread to every eliminate it via lockdown.  Those lockdowns were to save the health system and went on and on.  

That's totally different to the approach NZ and Australia take and you can't compare a mitigation lockdown strategy with an elimination lockdown strategy.",,,,1627272116,{},h6jt8r5,False,t3_orgvoe,False,False,t1_h6jruhy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/orgvoe/australian_prime_minister_calls_lockdownviolating/h6jt8r5/,1627413016,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_y78jf,False,False,,

Anyways I called and expressed my concern to which I was given all of these reasons. And after she said that she still would not get it I asked if she would do me one favor and it was to atleast keep and open mind, to which she said she would keep an open mind to any article I send her. 

So in conclusion I am trying to compile a list short/credible articles or videos about the safety of the vaccine and why she should get it.

This fear about mRNA is unfounded, because at least on paper it is much safer than vaccines we had so far. Most viruses ultimately produce mRNA to replicate themselves. With this vaccine instead of giving a weakened virus or part of a virus (like in case of HPV vaccine) we just deliver mRNA of that part of the virus. Essentially skipping these steps. We also don't need adjuvants (like the aluminum that antivax people complained about being present in previous vaccines).",,,,1627275918,{},h6jyzxn,False,t3_orb6od,False,True,t1_h6jgd20,/r/Coronavirus/comments/orb6od/many_americans_were_looking_forward_to_a_carefree/h6jyzxn/,1627416117,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_3pr1l,False,False,,

1) Most importantly if the vaccines aren't the end game? What is? The pre-vaccine NPIs should not last forever and ever, at some point there needs to be an end?

2) I am vaccinated, I am protected to some degree, it is my understanding as a common person and not an expert that if I were to get COVID-19 as a vaccinated person, I would most likely get a cold, maybe even a bad cold, but I most likely wouldn't be admitted to a hospital. Unvaccinated is a different story entirely, but how is that my problem as a vaccinated person? If a person ""chooses"" not get the vaccine, that is on them, they made the choice, they need to live with the consequences, wouldn't they? 

My point, even if a vaccinated person can spread it and I grant you it is possible, to another vaccinated person it would most likely be a cold, even a bad cold, not a major deal, to an unvaccinated person, it could be much much more, their choice  their risk, their problem isn't it?

Part of the reason is that vaccinated people are both less likely to get infected and less likely to pass on the virus even if they do get infected, scientists say. A vaccinated person without Covid symptoms seems especially unlikely to infect somebody else.  
‚ÄúWhat is clear is that people who are vaccinated and have symptomatic breakthrough infections can transmit it to other people,‚Äù Dr. Ashish Jha of Brown University said. ‚ÄúWhat is not at all clear is whether vaccinated asymptomatic people can transmit it.

Unvaccinated people are at higher risk to contract and spread the virus, and given the how transmissible COVID-19 is, once a breakout starts in a community it requires a dramatic cessation of normal activities in order to prevent it froms spreading widely.

As we know, the risks of the virus are both short term hospitalization and death, but also long term compromised health and disability. Unlike a private citizen, an organization the size of the NFL cannot pretend that it isn't aware of the dangers of COVID-19, because like all organizations, they've studied the data and know that if they have a breakout, and someone dies or contracts a long term disability that they can trace from infection through NFL activities, then the NFL will be exposed to a lawsuits for negligence but worse financially for them would be a star player, and important coach, or someone close to them contracting the virus and suffering life altering consequences and having that person with a massive platform be blaming the NFL publicly.

These are all risks to operations that the league is unwilling to carry, and therefore has shifted onto unvaccinated individuals.

Delta is still much less serious for kids than the previous variant was, but it‚Äôs also clearly more serious than the variant from last year. 

IMHO, I‚Äôd rather my kids had naturally acquired immunity last year when we had clear data showing that it was low risk, than wait around until it is higher risk.

Since the vaccines were originally developed with senior citizens in mind, it‚Äôs entirely possible a major reformulation is necessary for a safe and effective dose for those under 12, and a long study, etc. 

Kids are at the time of their life that they are learning the most rapidly, and body language and facial expressions are very important to learn.

Personally, I suspect that what we are seeing is a function of the high vaccination rate in Israel. Vaccine efficacy is a **relative** measure, that is, relative to unvaccinated, how much protection do you receive from being vaccinated. Combined with the fact that higher the vaccination rate the more likely the unvaccinated population is extremely different compared to the vaccinated population. The remaining hold-outs for the vaccine could be some how more cautious (children? socially isolated? stricter masking and gather precautions??) than the general population.

&gt; But the study, among the first to comparatively assess social interactions across households and mental wellbeing during the pandemic, found many older people experienced a greater increase in loneliness and long-term mental health disorders as a result of the switch to online socialising than those who spent the pandemic on their own.

‚Ä¶

&gt; ‚ÄúWe were expecting that a virtual contact was better than total isolation but that doesn‚Äôt seem to have been the case for older people,‚Äù he added.

&gt; The problem, said Hu, was that older people unfamiliar with technology found it stressful to learn how to use it. But even those who were familiar with technology often found the extensive use of the medium over lockdown so stressful that it was more damaging to their mental health than simply coping with isolation and loneliness.

&gt; ‚ÄúExtensive exposure to digital means of communication can also cause burnout. The results are very consistent,‚Äù said Hu, who collected data from 5,148 people aged 60 or over in the UK and 1,391 in the US ‚Äì both before and during the pandemic.

‚Ä¶

&gt; Hu said more emphasis needed to be placed on safe ways to have face-to-face contact in future emergencies. There must also, he added, be a drive to bolster the digital capacity of the older age groups.

Full vaccination is 87% for Pifzer - and there were zero fully vaccinated test-positive cases for Moderna/AZ (just means they weren't in the system - not that they are 100% effective).

I wonder if the recent work by DeepMind and the ability to accurately predict protein structures from the RNA data will be utilized - I have to imagine so, especially in conjunction with mRNA vaccines. 

We could analyze a virus, and if we find a point on that virus we want to 'mass produce' via an mRNA vaccine, we could run the expected RNA sequence through this AI, and see what structure is likely to pop out. I imagine this would dramatically cut down on time and cost.

[],,bigP0ppaJ,,,,,,[],"It's fairly straightforward math.  For herd immunity to be a thing, you need a certain percentage of the population to be immune and unable to spread the disease.  It's an estimate, but estimates for alpha variant were around 70%.  It's possible that delta variant would require something more like 90% though.

In the United States, currently almost exactly 50% of all inhabitants have been vaccinated.  About 160 million.  There are also 35 million known covid cases.  Now, it's possible there's overlap between those two groups, and also a lot of covid cases that weren't measured.  But we're talking rough numbers.  In a population of about 330 million, that leaves about 135 million people left who have no immunity whatsoever.

To get to herd immunity, we need to be at 90%.  90% is 297 million.  So we need another 100 million people to gain immunity.  We have enough data now to know that COVID kills about 1% of infected people in the best case - where the hospitals aren't overrun and people can get effective medical care.  But we've seen in a number of countries, that when hospitals get overrun, that number goes up a LOT.  3%.  5%.  These can all happen.  People who would otherwise survive end up dying in cabs, trying to get into hospitals that are full.  Bodies end up floating in rivers, because there's no place to bury or cremate them.

So it all depends on how fast COVID burns through the remaining population.  We could have another million deaths, if they refuse vaccination.  We could have 3 million, if Delta keeps growing exponentially.

If the vaccines had not ended up being effective, and we still only had barely effective treatment options, instead of our highly effective prevention options?

So, you let your kids or are fine with parents letting their kids play in lightning storms with metal rods? That‚Äôs what opening schools while Delta is running rampant is equivalent to. Most of the kids playing the storm won‚Äôt die, so it‚Äôs no big deal, right? The one kid that dies and the several that suffer long term damage aren‚Äôt a big deal, right? 

&gt;	Saying kids have died of COVID like it‚Äôs some kind of gotcha is juvenile and unproductive. 

Never said it as if it was a gotcha. Go back and review the context of my messages. My first and primary point is that COVID affects children negatively. Especially Delta. And that death isn‚Äôt the only metric to judge that.

But of course there‚Äôs always the anti-maskers and vaxxers that think children are of no consequence in this equation and it‚Äôs a travesty to suggest that we protect them from a novel virus they have zero protection from. Like the user I responded to.

Again, my primary point was that covid can have devastating effects on children outside of just death. Their response was that children aren‚Äôt dying from it. So I provided a source to the contrary. It‚Äôs that simple. It‚Äôs not a gotcha, it‚Äôs data to contradict their only point. 

&gt;	The point is whether it is significant. 

It is. Glad we established that. Outside of death their are a myriad of complications we know of and a possibility of some we don‚Äôt. A novel virus, in and of itself, in which we have no information for long-term, is significant. To suggest we protect children from that, and a mutated form of the virus at that, is not crazy.

&gt;If you're planning to visit the city this weekend, you might want to carry your vaccination card as many bars are now requiring to see proof of immunization.

&gt;Aside from your ID card, bars such as 7 Stills Brewery and Distillery started asking for proof of vaccination only if dining inside their establishment.

&gt;""Proof of vaccination either means you have your actual card or photo of your card. But that‚Äôs only inside,"" said manager Texas Enkil. ""Outside you can dine or drink in our beer garden, no proof of vaccination required.""

&gt;Mr. Tipple's Recording Studio, a jazz club in the city, made a similar move.

&gt;Since they only have indoor space, all of its musicians, staff and customers are now required to show proof of vaccination.

&gt;""It was done in order to keep our staff, our community, our musicians safe and hopefully to prevent another shutdown,"" said owner Jay Bordeleau.

&gt;Some bar goers are confused about the new requirements, and others are on board with business owners' decision.

&gt;""It‚Äôs a big logistical issue in a lot of ways but I think businesses have the right to enforce something,"" said Ari Lawrence from Oakland.

&gt;""I think it‚Äôs great. I don‚Äôt know how we‚Äôre all gonna get out of this if there isn't some way to prove that people are vaccinated,"" said Jennifer Redmond who is visiting from San Diego.

&gt;Ben Blieman, San Francisco Bar Owner Alliance's president said bars in the city are choosing to keep their staff and patrons safe, and not necessarily taking a moral stance on vaccination.

&gt;The group which represents more than 500 bar owners in San Francisco is expected to announce an updated policy on vaccination status Monday morning.

&gt;According to Blieman, 85% of bar owners in the city are in favor of requiring proof of vaccination for indoor customers.",,,,1627324964,{},h6m7jxk,True,t3_os543k,False,False,t3_os543k,/r/Coronavirus/comments/os543k/sf_bars_now_requiring_proof_of_vaccination/h6m7jxk/,1627458405,115,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_3yt33fuj,False,False,,

[],,fishicle,,,,,,[],"What vaccines essentially do is provide pieces of the virus (depending on the vaccine it can vary, some old ones were similar, less harmful viruses or viruses that have been damaged to prevent them from replicating, for the mRNA ones they make a limited number of copies of the protein the virus uses to enter cells) and your immune system, which reacts to foreign objects in your body, reacts to those virus pieces as foreign objects. In the process of reacting, it forms a memory of what was most effective against that foreign object, so if you get infected at a later time point by a similar object, then the body can much more quickly react with an effective response. That's why even when infected, a vaccinated individual will typically get lesser disease symptoms. Furthermore, after exposure your body will regularly produce more antibodies against it that will circulate in your blood, which is what we measure as the ""antibody titer"" to determine how effectively immunized someone is - the higher the antibody titer that targets the desired pathogen, the better your body is at preventing infection in the first place. For instance, when I got a summer job at a hospital I had to have my immunizations for a number of diseases confirmed with antibody titers and found that my Hep A titer was below threshold, so I got a Hep A booster vaccination.

As for why myocarditis (heart inflammation) can occur as a rare vaccine side effect, sadly I don't have a straightforward answer for you, though it is a current topic of research and wouldn't be surprised if we find out more in the coming months. The following stuff is purely my best guess based off of my knowledge having majored in biology and now being 4 years into a PhD studying developmental biology in fruit flies - though not strictly the same, some concepts carry over and I have some skill in reading and interpreting biomedical literature, but I'll openly admit that (in my opinion) the immune system is one of the most complex and difficult to understand areas of human biology along with the central nervous system.

Inflammation in general is part of an immune response, in a very basic sense you can divide the immune response into a local, immediate inflammation that acts generally and a systemic, slower antibody response that is specific to the foreign object it's reacting to. Specifically, myocarditis has been observed in response to some viral infections, including the flu and SARS-nCoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), though whether this is due specifically to virus infecting the heart tissue or is occurring when the virus infects other tissues. One possibility that springs to mind is that IF myocarditis can occur in SARS-nCoV-2 infections of non-heart tissues (which would be through some immune mechanism, specifics uncertain at this time), then the myocarditis events in the case of the vaccine would very likely occur through the same path. If so, that also may provide a potential method for preventative treatment of COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis if we can block that path safely. Another possibility, though I'll admit I do not fully know how far fetched this may be, would be if the mRNA of the vaccine is taken up in cells of either the circulatory or lymphatic that manage to migrate to the heart before the mRNA has degraded, such that at the heart they make the present the viral spike protein and cause an immune response against it to occur in heart tissues. Such immune response could reasonably include inflammation. It is important to note here that there still wasn't any actively replicating virus, merely one of our cells producing a single viral protein when the cell is at the heart. Such events would be rare, as the data has shown, and as for why it is higher in young males, myocarditis in generally is higher in young males so I would hazard to guess that whatever factors make them more susceptible to it in general (such as in response to a flu infection) would apply the same to myocarditis that is vaccine-related.

Just as a final note, though the Israel study did find increased myocarditis in young men in response to the vaccine, it is important to note that it includes minor cases and most clear up within a few weeks, so the risk of severe, life-changing effects is significantly lower than \~1/5000, here's a nice link from Yale about it ([https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/myocarditis-coronavirus-vaccine](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/myocarditis-coronavirus-vaccine)).

Boris Johnson believes that the impact of last Monday‚Äôs ‚Äúfreedom day‚Äù will drive infections up again meaning the UK is ‚Äúnot out of the woods yet‚Äù, a spokesman said.

&gt; The number of infections reported on Monday was 24,950, a drop of 40 per cent on the figure from one week earlier. It is the lowest daily number for more than three weeks and confirms that the decline in cases is not just a statistical quirk.

&gt; The past week is the first time that the nation‚Äôs epidemic has turned from growing to shrinking without a full lockdown. Experts have pointed to the impact of warm weather, school holidays and the end of the European Championship football but are uncertain whether the decline will be sustained.

&gt; Ministers and Downing Street officials are concerned that the good news on cases could encourage people to let down their guard and send the trend into reverse. A No 10 spokesman said: ‚ÄúThroughout the pandemic we have always said it‚Äôs encouraging when cases are falling‚Ä¶ but the PM has said many times that the pandemic is not over and we are not out of the woods yet.

&gt; ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that we will have seen the impact of step four on case numbers yet. We‚Äôve been always been clear that step four of the roadmap, given what it entailed, we believed would lead to an increase in cases.‚Äù The Government wants to encourage the use of regular lateral flow tests, as well as vaccine uptake, to stop infection rates spiralling out of control.

In the UK: 

* The least lonely group was the one that had frequent face-to-face AND virtual contact. 
* The group with the highest wellbeing had frequent face-to-face contact, and the amount of virtual contact made no difference.

  
In the USA:

* The group with the highest wellbeing was, again, the one that had frequent face-to-face AND virtual contact.
* The loneliest group was the one the headline refers to, who had frequent virtual but infrequent face-to-face contact.

  
Miscellaneous bits of interest:

* They aren't sure whether the loneliest American group were cause or effect -- whether they were experiencing more loneliness because they were burnt out on virtual contact, or whether they were initiating more virtual contact because they were lonely (I would buy either or both of these explanations, tbh).
* People living alone had more face-to-face contact in both countries (I could take a punt at why this was the case in the UK -- living alone during lockdown allowed you to form a ""support bubble"" which meant you could freely mix with one other household of any size. I don't know if anywhere in the USA had similar policies). 
* Data was collected with a postal questionnaire in the USA, and an online one in the UK, which might mean different levels of comfort with technology, or not.
* The USA got much lonelier overall during the pandemic. In the UK 11.1% of people got lonelier, but 13.6% of people got less lonely.
* The Guardian article interviews the first author on this study, and quotes him as saying that older people who were unfamiliar with technology were stressed by it. This is definitely a thing in general, and they quote other research on it in the study, but I can't see anywhere that they asked their own dataset about it, so who knows.

tl;dr: more contact is better, face-to-face actively helps; beyond that, shit's complicated.

  
I work in an area adjacent to this (hence my interest) and we are basically finding that older people are *extremely* split on whether virtual contact is helpful or harmful (but also that it depends partly on what activities they use it for). I would also note that the big stressors for a lot of the people I work with are not so much things like getting online or installing Zoom, but more a general mistrust of stuff like online safety and privacy; softer skills that the internet is really scary without.",,,,1627314626,{},h6ljpxs,False,t3_orxzs3,False,False,t3_orxzs3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/orxzs3/virtual_contact_worse_than_no_contact_for_over60s/h6ljpxs/,1627446482,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_5l2q5wse,False,False,,

The shifting numbers still overwhelmingly show young people are safer.  The change in ratios of young to old infected are a reflection of the difference in vaccination rates.  The one good thing about this though is that it shows the vaccinations are working‚Ä¶really friggin well.

Put another way, and these numbers are very arbitrary, the previous ratio let‚Äôs say is 100 old to 1 young person.  Now with vaccination, it‚Äôs 10 old to 1 young person and 10 of the 11 in that ratio are unvaccinated.  Well with a new variant and the new variable of vaccination status on top of all the other dependent variables, drawing conclusions is difficult even if pretty obvious.

Vaccines reducing the severity of symptoms and hospitalization is probably true.  But for young people with a minuscule hospitalization rate and something even lower when vaccinated will need an exorbitantly high number of cases to power a statistical proof which is just unlikely.

At the same time, it‚Äôs an unmitigated disaster from a policy perspective. It benefits the anti-mask/anti-vax crowd because there‚Äôs no enforcement of the ‚Äúvax = no mask needed‚Äù bit. That, piled on top of the variant strains currently circulating (which are ridiculously contagious and should require masks even if vaccinated persons) means that we need to go back to masking in general, and might even need to go back to enforced closures.

They should have a) tied relaxation of mandates to local % vaccinated rather than making it an individual thing, b) explicitly made it contingent on having the numbers stay in control, and c) tested it on a local level before making it a national policy.

I live in Ontario, probably the most locked-down place on the entire continent, and I see that cases are rising (as they are most places that haven't already had a Delta wave) and it's likely we'll wind up rolling back even the modest amount of reopening we did.

It gives me horrible flashbacks to summer 2020, when I was living in downtown Toronto, and I knew that nothing we were doing would be enough to stop a wave when it eventually came. Masks? Contact tracing? If Zero COVID is not possible (something like it was possible for Atlantic Canada, but that was luck, not virtue) then you are going to get hit with a wave the same time as your neighbours do, and delaying reopening will not help. It just takes away the time people have to enjoy their lives before the wave hits. Now it's happening again.

My point of view is pessimistic, I guess. I think the people who think anyone can suppress COVID are as over-optimistic as the people who think it will go away on its own. Every pre-2020 pandemic plan called for keeping life as normal as possible in part because restrictions get less effective over time, and morale drops, and you don't have anything left to fight the big waves. But we threw all that away and adopted this unprecedented idea that we should throw everything at it as soon as we can. Lockdowns and even mask mandates should be saved for when things are at their worst, like in 1918 (the way people talk about it you'd think they had restrictions for years; weeks was more like it).

I went back and forth on whether to agree with Sweden. On the one hand, they did much worse than their neighbours, so I have to assume they did something wrong. And on the other hand, their policy was actually more hard-line than I'd like (e.g. banning gatherings over 50: in much worse pandemics, no one thought it was OK just to wipe out live entertainment indefinitely).

But what I think people don't understand about Sweden's policy is that it did not come from a place of optimism. It was from a place of extreme pessimism: we are going to be doing this for years, and we have to have restrictions that don't make people miserable. Whereas Ontario and many other places adopted the idea that if you make people miserable now, everything will be fine later. Of course that's not true and we should never have thought it was true. Misery now just leads to more misery later.",,,,1627260423,{},h6j8btq,False,t3_or6v1d,False,False,t3_or6v1d,/r/Coronavirus/comments/or6v1d/daily_discussion_thread_july_25_2021/h6j8btq/,1627401510,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_b2hn134v,False,False,,

Just let it burn itself out through the population.  

That might not be a popular opinion around here because of how wrong it was when it was first suggested over a year ago, but the argument looks MUCH stronger to me today than it was back then for several reasons:

* We have the vaccines now.  They are still highly effective against Delta.  So they are still a great option for anyone who wants to personally protect themselves.  This totally changes the social situation - protecting others who can't protect themselves is a completely different ask than protecting others who refuse to protect themselves.

* Our healthcare system is almost surely going to be just fine.  Hospitals weren't burning to the ground in January when we had five times as many daily cases as we have now, and it's highly unlikely that we'll ever surpass that peak.  It's clear that we have a massive capacity to handle covid cases without our whole system grinding to a halt as was feared last year.  

* It looks to me like we already had herd immunity, because we had this thing totally under control for damn near 6 months, with several of those involving few/no restrictions almost anywhere.  Delta has now come in and simply moved the equation (because the contagiousness of the virus is a major variable in herd immunity).  Perhaps we were at 70% immune and that was enough, but now Delta is so contagious that maybe we need 85%, or 90%, or what have you.  Whatever the number is, we can't be THAT far off of it still.

The health ministry's ethical committee had in May suspended the approval process for the clinical trials, and requested additional information. 

According to the state drug register, five Russian clinics will hold trials that are set to finish in early March, 2022.

Both the AstraZeneca/Oxford and Sputnik V vaccines involve two doses -- an initial shot and a booster-- but Sputnik V uses different viral vectors for its two shots.

So-called viral vector shots use harmless modified viruses as vehicles, or vectors, to carry genetic information that helps the body build immunity against future infections.

&amp;#x200B;

For only three weeks, Moscow restaurants did not serve visitors without QR codes. They could be obtained not only by vaccinated people, but also by those who had been ill, as well as those with a fresh negative PCR test. At the same time, statistical indicators from federal registers were encrypted in QR codes with certificates that began to come to Russians. Studying the certificates issued by State Services, Meduza, Kholod and Mediazona found that there are already more than 29 million entries in the register of the Ministry of Health, created to track the number of cases of coronavirus. This is five times more than officially reported by the operational headquarters for the fight against coronavirus.

&amp;#x200B;

Mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobyanin announced on June 22 that in a week, restaurants and cafes will only allow visitors with QR codes. Those Muscovites who had been vaccinated, had had covid in the last six months, or passed a negative PCR test could get them through the mos.ru Moscow portal of state services .

&amp;#x200B;

The measure was not planned as a short-term one, and it did not leave any chances for non-Muscovites to get into restaurants, so for them a similar system of assigning QR codes was later implemented through the federal portal ""Gosuslug""; and if the Moscow site began issuing codes on June 28, then ""Gosuslugi"" - only from July 1.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Deputy Minister of Digital Development of Russia Oleg Kachanov explained this delay on June 24 by the need to integrate ""State Services"" with the bases of the Ministry of Health. ‚ÄúThere is a unified register of those who have been ill in the information resources of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation ... We will do this integration, and for those who have had it, and there are about nine million such records in the register, we will receive them \[QR codes\],‚Äù he said official in an interview with ""Russia 24"".

&amp;#x200B;

The number of patients named by Kachanov - about nine million - became a sensation, because, judging by the data of the headquarters on the same day - June 24, - just under five million Russians were ill with the coronavirus. However, as the journalists of the three editions found out, the official did not overestimate, but even underestimated this number.

&amp;#x200B;

The researcher of statistical anomalies, physicist Sergei Shpilkin, who studies vaccination rates, drew attention to the words of Kachanov and their discrepancy with official statistics. And soon he put forward a hypothesis that the real number of those who had been ill can be estimated based on the numbers of the State Services certificates with a QR code - since they are somehow connected with the federal register for covid.

&amp;#x200B;

Physicist Sergei Shpilkin usually investigates statistical anomalies in voting, but with the onset of the epidemic, he began to closely monitor the statistics of morbidity and mortality from covid, as well as the progress of vaccinations. He noticed that on the ""State Services"" vaccination certificates are numbered in order, and asked those who wish to send him part of the number of their certificate. An analysis of the collected numbers led him to the conclusion that the numbering of vaccination certificates is the same for the whole of Russia, which means that by the number of the certificate (the last eight digits) you can find out how many people have been vaccinated in the country by that moment. The numbers obtained by Shpilkin completely coincided with the data on vaccinations, which were collected by independent analysts (the Ministry of Health never began to publish these data).

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, Shpilkin ""had another idea . "" He suggested that since vaccination certificates are numbered in order, then certificates for those who have been ill can be arranged in a similar way. And again he asked everyone for help: send an impersonal part of the certificate number and the date of recovery from the coronavirus indicated in it.

&amp;#x200B;

Unique numberA Mediazona reader from Moscow contracted the coronavirus at the end of March, but got sick easily and within two weeks already received a negative PCR test. Three months later, the Gosuslugi app sent her a notification about a ""COVID-19 immunization certificate"" and a QR code for visiting Moscow restaurants.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, this code is a simple hyperlink that leads to a special section of the site ""Gosuslug"". By opening this link, the restaurant employee must make sure that the visitor can be in the restaurant premises. And if you open the link on a computer and look at the page code, you can see that the certificate number is indicated by the abbreviation UNRZ (unrz). This is the ""Unique register record number"", this term is used in many registers of the Ministry of Health - the same designation is also on the page with the vaccination certificate code.

&amp;#x200B;

The day after the speech by Deputy Minister Kachanov on integration with the register of cases, on June 25, a description of the data download scheme ""from the COVID register"" appeared in the  situation center of the Ministry of Digital Science and on the  technical portal . In addition to other data, the 15-digit UNRZ number must also be transferred from the register.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it possible to see this number in the certificate of the patient who has recovered? The journalists of Meduza, Holod and Mediazona found out that yes.The number of the certificate of the past illness consists of 16 digits: this is an eight, a two-digit region code and a unit (this number is the same in all the certificates we checked and, judging by  similar registers , denotes the recipient of budgetary funds); the next four digits are month and year; but the last eight digits are the unique number of the patient.

&amp;#x200B;

The same format (only without the eight at the beginning, that is, 15-digit) is used in the formation of the NRM in the  Federal Register of Persons with New Coronavirus Infection.

* Remarks to Parliament give first timeline for reopening border
* Leaders expect to have 80% of population vaccinated by then

Singapore aims to relax more virus curbs, including starting to allow quarantine-free travel in September, marking the first time it‚Äôs set out a timeline to reopen borders that have been mostly shut for more than a year.

The Southeast Asian city-state expects to have fully vaccinated 80% of its population by then, placing the nation in a solid position to move forward with reopening, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong told Parliament on Monday.

That will allow authorities to ease measures, including allowing larger gatherings of fully vaccinated people. The country also will be able to start reopening borders and establishing travel corridors with other countries or regions that have infections under control.

‚ÄúWhile other countries may have come to terms with a certain level of Covid -19 cases and even deaths, this is not the choice we want to make in Singapore,‚Äù Wong said. ‚ÄúAt the same time, there is no need to wait for everyone to be vaccinated before we begin to open up. That would mean holding back the entire reopening timeline until much later in the year, which is not tenable.‚Äù

One of the world‚Äôs success stories in containing the virus, Singapore suffered a setback in mid-July after infections spread in karaoke lounges and a fishery port that supplies produce to markets all over the island. More than 1,000 people have been infected in the clusters, and the city set a daily record of local virus cases.

**Temporary Setback**

Singapore was aiming to have two-thirds of the population vaccinated by its Aug. 9 independence day, after which it planned to ease more measures. But the outbreaks and growing concern that 200,000 elderly have yet to be vaccinated prompted authorities to tighten curbs, raising questions as to whether the city-state was deviating from its reopening path.

‚ÄúThe answer is a clear no. We are determined to get to our destination of being a Covid-resilient Singapore. But our journey must take into account public health realities,‚Äù Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong said in a separate speech to Parliament. ‚ÄúSometimes, we may need to take a detour if we see hazards ahead. This way we can ensure that we will get to our final destination safely, even though it may take a little longer.‚Äù

Authorities will review existing virus curbs in early August based on factors such as the overall infection rate. A positive outcome will allow the government to ease some of the measures -- but only for vaccinated people, Wong said.

Once key inoculation levels have been reached, Wong said, fully vaccinated people may be able to travel without serving a 14-day hotel quarantine on their return. Depending on the risk level of the countries visited, quarantine can be replaced with a rigorous testing regime, or the quarantine can be shortened to seven days and served at home. Unvaccinated individuals can also travel, but will have to quarantine.

**Shifting Approaches**

Health Minister Ong Ye Kung told Parliament that Singapore is already shifting parts of its approach to live with the virus, and having 200 or more cases a day may not be unusual in an endemic scenario.

More infected patients who show no or mild symptoms can now be housed in community-care facilities rather than hospitals, he said. That has already been the case for patients aged 17-45, and authorities will expand the bracket to age 59, he said.

That means that as many as 60% of infected cases may recover in community-care facilities. The government aims to raise the number to 80%, with some patients even recovering at home, he said.

Although Singapore is proceeding with progressive easing, Wong cautioned that it may have to dial back on its measures if the situation worsens.

‚ÄúAt each stage of easing we will monitor the health outcomes, especially the hospitalization and intensive care unit cases closely,‚Äù Wong said. ‚ÄúWe will ensure that these remain acceptable and stable, before we proceed to the next step. But if hospitalization cases -- or worse, severe illnesses -- were to shoot up, we will have to be prepared to slow down, or even pull back.‚Äù",,,,1627322596,{},h6m24dw,True,t3_os2iqs,False,True,t3_os2iqs,/r/Coronavirus/comments/os2iqs/singapore_eyes_starting_quarantinefree_travel_in/h6m24dw/,1627455735,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_57c32zx5,False,True,,

It's not *just* that naive guidance from the CDC, but the way the cards were issued to begin with.

There was no barcode or QR code with the data on the card (so it couldn't be faked, as some people are doing), and there's no digital passport (so while you can take a picture of the card, it's not actually proof). 

Not that any of this matters since some states are actively barring the inquiry of vaccination status and most everyone is extremely skittish about doing so anyway. Some employers or colleges have begun to require it to attend or register the status in order to allow exemptions from mask wearing, but the average person doesn't know if their colleague or peer is following those rules or not.

God‚Ä¶. Mother Fucking people. Look it‚Äôs real simple - this is a simple binary decision. Here‚Äôs how it goes. You WILL encounter covid one day over the course of your life time. Period. The virus is far too transmissible and endemic for you not to encounter it one day (may be tomorrow, May be 4 years from now.) So, you can A) not get the vaccine and face covid head on, with no pre-orchestrated immune response Or B) take the vaccine and give your self a significantly greater chance of being asymptomatic or lightly symptomatic (in the 90% range for all current variants). 

So there we have it. You and your loved ones will deal with the consequences from this simple decision making process. I wish more people were educated and can see this is a very simple weighing of pros and cons. I leave with a final thought, lack of evidence against something is NOT evidence for THAT something. Because the vaccine trials didn‚Äôt explicitly test for fertility issues, microchips, heart issues etc. doesn‚Äôt mean there is evidence for those things. It simply means that you shouldn‚Äôt assume any of those things to be true without evidence. In either case, at this point side effects are incredibly rare.

The fact that we are still learning bout how unpredictable this virus can be is alittle scary and I've had a few people come up to me and ask why I got vaccinated because I had covid.

Alot of people are bring up the SARS 1 how they had immunity years later but let's also not forget that it didn't have the amount of people and time to mutate like covid has I don't really know though still says,reinfection is rare but we don't know how rare it really us yet not enough time has,passed.

Volunteers include nearly 300 doctors, 200 pharmacists and nearly 700 people working in various sectors joining the front lines.  
  
The city‚Äôs Department of Health is mobilising volunteers for COVID-19 treatment health facilities and districts facing a shortage of human resources for prevention and control activities.  
  
S∆°n, head of the ministry‚Äôs special standing division in HCM City, issued an appeal letter on Saturday calling for people with a medical background, including active and retired medical officers, lecturers and students, as well as members of health associations, to help relieve some of the burden on the healthcare system, which is now under severe strain.  
  
People can sign up to volunteer by contacting the Department of Health via 02839309967 or 0907574269.  
  
Last week, city leaders asked the central Government to mobilise more than 12,000 medical officers, including doctors, nurses, and medical technicians to support the fight against the COVID-19 outbreak.  
  
Overburdened system  
  
The COVID-19 outbreak has overwhelmed the city‚Äôs public healthcare system, which is estimated to be capable of treating about 30,000 COVID-19 cases, according to Deputy Minister of Heatlh Nguy·ªÖn Tr∆∞·ªùng S∆°n.  
  
The city is in dire need of support from the central Government and the Ministry of Health to add more resources to curb the outbreak.  
  
As of Sunday, the city had reported more than 61,192,000 cases since late April.   
  
The newly established HCM City Rehabilitation Hospital with 1,000 beds for severely and critically ill patients needs more than 1,300 medical staff, said Dr. Nguy·ªÖn Tri Th·ª©c, director of HCM City COVID-19 Rehabilitation Hospital.  
  
It has 835 medical officers and administrative staff so far, according to Th·ª©c, who is director of Ch·ª£ R·∫´y Hospital.  
  
With a surge in the number of cases, the hospital asked the Ministry of Health to mobilise more human resources for treatment of severe cases.  
  
Dr. Nguy·ªÖn Duy Long, director of the 115 Emergency Centre in HCM City, said the centre was struggling as 1,200-1,800 positive COVID-19 cases were being transferred to hospitals every day, far exceeding its capacity.  
  
He has asked the health sector to mobilise more emergency medical staff from other health facilities to provide emergency services for COVID-19 patients in a timely manner.  
  
The Field Hospital No. 2 in the city‚Äôs District 12 with nearly 200 medical staff is now operating at full capacity to receive COVID-19 patients.  
  
The hospital has proposed adding more physicians who are respiratory specialists as doctors there are working double their normal shift. ‚Äî VNS",,,,1627315630,{},h6lm0cr,True,t3_os1voy,False,False,t3_os1voy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/os1voy/vietnam_city_seeks_volunteer_medical_staff_to/h6lm0cr/,1627447642,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_10wdsu,False,False,,

‚ÄúResults: In this cohort of 6 lactating women who received 2 doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we observed significantly elevated levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA antibodies in breast milk beginning at Day 7 after the initial vaccine dose, with an IgG-dominant response.


Conclusions and Relevance: We are the first to show that maternal vaccination results in SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulins in breast milk that may be protective for infants.‚Äù
