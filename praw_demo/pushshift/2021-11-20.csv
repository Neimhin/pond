Dr. Topol has been awesome on this issue. His Twitter feed on COVID related issues is a must read for me. He always links to the newest studies on vaccines and news about new treatments in the works. Very good info there.

Here is a debate he has with Dr. Sarah Long (one of the most anti-booster scientists who serves on the CDC ACIP group). Fast forward to about 1 hour and 6 minutes in. Dr. Topol (arguing in favor of boosters) has been waiting and waiting while Dr. Long was doing her spiel and then just tears into the whole ""all that is important is protection against hospitalization and death"" argument.

&gt; “We went into this project thinking we would see a higher rate of negative outcomes in people with a history of malaria infections, because that’s what was seen in patients co-infected with malaria and Ebola,” said Jane Achan, a senior research advisor at the Malaria Consortium and a co-author of the study. “We were actually quite surprised to see the opposite — that malaria may have a protective effect.”

[],,Embarrassed_Low2183,,,,,,[],"Covid is not endemic yet by far. Endemic means we are at a reasonable infection and death rate. This is why it's called a pandemic because we are not at the endemic phase. Just because we have our vaccines does not make it endemic.

Here's a couple things to think about.

Many serious viruses like polio, mumps, measles were eradicated or are basically eradicated.

Influenza and it's variants are really the only serious virus that became a pandemic to become endemic in the United States (at least for dice s very longtime). Sure there are some serious viruses like West Nile present but no where near the same numbers of infection as influenza. 

The interesting thing about influenza is we gained population immunity through those that survived. Their genetics were passed on to us. It's really interesting because they have found parts of the human genome that they used to call junk, however some of that junk is DNA from ancient viruses. They are still learning how this so plays in. 

 If you look at the Spanish flu (influenza) there was no vaccine. Those who couldn't survive it didn't, unless they were lucky, and thus their genes weren't passed on. So why is this important? Well we have a vaccine protecting us from covid. However, it's protecting many people who are genetically susceptible to covid. This still puts them at much higher risk and no one knows who these people are. This is particularly true because new studies are finding genetic involvement for severe covid. Unlike the case with the Spanish flu pandemic we are working against natural selection with our covid vaccine.

The r value of the Spanish flu was 1.8 for covid strains (like Delta) I have seen an r value up to and between 6.5-8. This means it's way way more contagious, up to 4x. 

Many of the really serious viruses mentioned above didn't end up endemic. Influenza did but again there wasn't a vaccine for the Spanish flu so it was just natural selection acting, so as a population we are genetically predisposed to survive it thanks to our ancestors genetics. That's why the comparison of the flu to COVID is drastically off because genetically I'm many areas the weeding hasn't been done. 

The goal of a virus is not to kill it's host (unless it spreads through dead I suppose). If a virus kills it's host it's not passed on,  but some people are going to die even a new virus is introduced. In the case particularly, because this coronavirus likely coevolved with bats which have way better immune functioning than humans due to their extremely fast metabolism and other factors which keep it in check. Being many people haven't been exposed to lineage B type coronaviruses (Sars, covid, ECT) there will be genetic weaknesses present in the population. This is generally when natural selection occurs.

Cool thing about viruses is they mutate. So eventually they can get around vaccines if they don't die out. They have found strains of covid where the spike protein was much less readily identifiable by antibodies from vaccination. However, the more infectious strains are stopping the spread of those right now like Delta. It is true covid has what we call proof reading machinery which causes less mutations to occur which is maybe good. Although, with an r as high as 8 how will that fair? We have already seen mutations and it's only two years. Plus, they are finding it infects wild resivors like deer. Spreading between different species can often introduce mutations as well. With the way our modern world works the spread around the world is much easier than many of the historic pandemic viruses. This leads to higher spread that may have never been possible in previous pandemics. Our modern world is primed for crazy viral spread like this unfortunately. Bill gates was telling people this for years and that we needed to prepare because it was inevitable but no one listened. 

These things all lead to one major difference from previous pandemics. This is the first time we were able to vaccinate a large portion of the populate before natural selection has taken place realistically, so this is all just a giant science experiment. As vaccine immunity wanes or mutates arise we may not see the endemic phase right away. Would it be awesome if we did? Hell yeah, but nothing in life is that simple. 

So there are many more variables than just what we want and what has happened with previous pandemic viruses that became endemic at play.

And if you think about it, do you know any immunocompromised people? Because when we all say fuck it those people are exposed. Immunocompromised people are only as immune as those around them often. The vaccine may help them or old people but may not be enough in the end. That'll be different when we have antivirals and know the mechanism of disease action though.

So what is the point of using other mechanisms of prevention? It's not too try and wait till COVID goes away, that's just stupid. It's not going away. It's just giving science more time to catch up and flattening the curve.

Again, not endemic I wish people would stop spreading this. Just cause it's not going away doesn't make it endemic yet. It will be though. 

If we reacted better to this in the very beginning as a world it could have been much better. However, how would we do that as a world.

I'm sure I'll get down voted because what we want is different than reality.",,,,1637481789,{},hlhj80g,False,t3_qy9pdy,False,False,t1_hlg5rm7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qy9pdy/dutch_police_open_fire_on_covid_lockdown/hlhj80g/,1637835402.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_9753gigj,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Israel was at UK's point by early August in terms of boosters. Cases kept skyrocketing until late September. Singapore had the same timing.

[],,Gatsu871113,,,,,,,"Vaccines don’t kill COVID.  It’s not like there are clouds of sterilizing mist hovering like an aura around vaccinated people.  
  
Vaccines give the vaccinated person’s immune system the recipe to identify and make immune cells that can fight off a COVID infection after it already takes root in a host.  Whether asymptomatic, or feeling horrible, most vaccinated people’s total “COVID journey”, is a 3-8 day affair.  Some indeterminate period where the virus is present and the body is unaware of, or just getting acquainted with the disease, followed by the period of time the person experiences COVID’s effects and fights it off.  Sometime the whole experience goes unnoticed.  That’s what an asymptomatic “carrier” *is*.  
  
Unvaccinated people generally have longer duration experiences with COVID, and more of them are symptomatic, more of them are hospitalized, and more of them die.  Since they are more symptomatic and longer-duration infections, they get the lion’s share of blame for transmission.  
  
I don’t see it as a black and white difference.  
  
Anyway, since the virus can multiply and be transmitted regardless of the host type, just to differing degrees, the answer to your question is obvious... the disease is like a type of chain reaction.  It spreads so easily and multiplies so fast, it only ever dies permanently (in a pragmatic sense) when there are an insufficient number of people for it to leapfrog to, who lack the active form of the immune cells that actually do the “COVID killing” duty in our bodies.  
  
Our immune systems archive that “recipe” for making the active immune cells some duration after an episode of I understand defender is complete.  If reinfection occurs, it takes time for the system to demobilize the same recipe, because the body doesn’t immediately know if it is responding to a flu, COVID, or a paper cut that introduced some bacteria into the body.  
  
It’s looking like we live in a world where there are enough free hosts without currently-active immune *fighting cells*, where COVID can do as it wills, leapfrogging from person to person.

Lipsitch is far from alone in his belief that this virus will continue to spread widely. The emerging consensus among epidemiologists is that the most likely outcome of this outbreak is **a new seasonal disease—a fifth “endemic” coronavirus.** With the other four, people are not known to develop long-lasting immunity. **If this one follows suit, and if the disease continues to be as severe as it is now, “cold and flu season” could become “cold and flu and COVID-19 season.”**

This is what we are seeing now. It would have been good if more public health officials were up front with this, instead of implying or directly saying that through behavioral actions we could ***eradicate*** COVID-19.

You can't tell me the covid death stats is even remotely accurate. South Africa for example has registered 89,000 covid deaths according to worldometers the most in Africa yet some of it's neighbours like Kenya with a similar population only has 5,300 covid deaths or Nigeria only has 2,900 covid deaths with a much bigger population. All those countries have a fairly young population but i think it's pretty clear from those stats you can see Africa is no doubt missing a large number of covid deaths. Hell even South Africa is because the excess deaths in South Africa since March 2020 is 271,000 which is like 3x higher. Of course not all those excess deaths would be covid but that still shows that South Africa is likely missing quite a number of deaths. 

A few articles have even showed it's pretty evident they're missing deaths due to lack of infrastructure etc.

The backstory is we have a new DHSS director and this one follows science. So on the one hand, we’re getting massive backlogged data of things like deaths and non-lab-confirmed Covid tests that the prior director suppressed. A massive dump was shared Thursday evening and some places recorded it Friday but it’s not backdated. 

On the other hand, some counties also shut down for holidays and have massive delays so they’ll report just once a week which shows poorly on data (Jackson reports more frequently but did have a delay). Especially when our state is in a climb which it is now. Jackson also just dropped masking so that’s likely going to give a bump of its own. 

Missouri likely will not have any good data this week or next because of the holiday and data dumps so we won’t have reliable data trend info until the first full week of December, at which point it’s likely to be bad. Our positivity rate rose about 5% in the last 10 days across the state and that’s before holiday spread.

&gt;During the latter half of 2020, epidemiologists began to observe signs of a concerning phenomenon known as viral recombination, in which different versions of Sars-CoV-2 exchanged mutations and combined to form a totally new strain.

&gt;Thankfully, Gupta says recombination does not appear to be that common, but it remains one feasible source of a new super variant, particularly in parts of the world where sizable proportions of the population remain unvaccinated and viral strains can circulate freely. “Now that Delta is overwhelmingly the key virus, this has become less likely,” he says. “But there are large swaths of the planet that we’re not sampling and we don’t know what’s going on. So it is a very real possibility.”

Many experts told that super variant stuff is more like a sensationalism rather than true possibility. They say there will be an unstoppable monster that will make vaccines useless, medicines will be useless and it will destroy everything and everyone on its path.

Background  
Asymptomatic patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can develop hypercoagulable conditions and acute vascular events. The objective of this study is to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 was present in resected specimens from patients with acute bowel ischemia, but asymptomatic for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and with persistently real-time polymerase chain reaction negative pharyngeal swab.  
  
Methods  
Three consecutive patients presented severe abdominal symptoms due to extensive ischemia and necrosis of the bowel, with co-existent thrombosis of abdominal blood vessels. None had the usual manifestations of COVID-19, and repeated pharyngeal swabs tested negative. They underwent emergency surgery with intestinal resection. Immunohistochemical testing for SARS-CoV-2 on resected tissue was performed.  
  
Results  
All tested samples were strongly positive for SARS-CoV-2.  
  
Conclusions  
This is the first case report in which patients with severe intestinal symptoms presented a marked SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the resected tissues, without any usual clinical manifestations of COVID-19. These results suggest that the patients might be infected with SARS-CoV-2 presenting acute abdominal distress but without respiratory or constitutional symptoms.",,,,1637494396,{},hlhz9q1,True,t3_qyt63b,False,False,t3_qyt63b,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qyt63b/bowel_ischemia_as_onset_of_covid19_in_otherwise/hlhz9q1/,1637843539.0,15,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Public health departments identified primary and secondary cases by using coronavirus disease surveillance data, case investigations, and contact tracing. A primary case was defined as SARS-CoV-2 detected &lt;14 days after travel to or residence in Provincetown during July 3–17. A secondary case was defined as SARS-CoV-2 detected &lt;14 days after close contact with a person who had a primary case but without travel to or residence in Provincetown during July 3–August 10. We identified 1,098 primary cases and 30 secondary cases associated with 26 primary cases among fully and non–fully vaccinated persons.

Back and forth transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) between humans and animals will establish wild reservoirs of virus that endanger long-term efforts to control COVID-19 in people and to protect vulnerable animal populations. Better targeting surveillance and laboratory experiments to validate zoonotic potential requires predicting high-risk host species. A major bottleneck to this effort is the few species with available sequences for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, a key receptor required for viral cell entry. We overcome this bottleneck by combining species' ecological and biological traits with three-dimensional modelling of host-virus protein–protein interactions using machine learning. This approach enables predictions about the zoonotic capacity of SARS-CoV-2 for greater than 5000 mammals—an order of magnitude more species than previously possible. Our predictions are strongly corroborated by in vivo studies. The predicted zoonotic capacity and proximity to humans suggest enhanced transmission risk from several common mammals, and priority areas of geographic overlap between these species and global COVID-19 hotspots. With molecular data available for only a small fraction of potential animal hosts, linking data across biological scales offers a conceptual advance that may expand our predictive modelling capacity for zoonotic viruses with similarly unknown host ranges.",,,,1637493631,{},hlhy948,True,t3_qyszia,False,False,t3_qyszia,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qyszia/predicting_the_zoonotic_capacity_of_mammals_to/hlhy948/,1637842979.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There seems to be currently a relatively broad consensus that acute Covid-19 infections are not that dangerous for children (and for Long Covid, hard data is simply missing).

However, the high incidence numbers among children turn out to spread up to older age groups.

- addresses the population that has already shown acceptance of the vaccine, which is a very easy target to squeeze out a bit more immunity; i.e. it might not be the best way to turn your stocked vaccines into improved control over the pandemic, but it is certainly the *easiest* for politics

- addresses fears of the disease in the population and makes people feel safer (even if that were completely irrational, it would work)

[],,helembad,,,,,,,"&gt;This week for instance we were at 48k at the start and now after several days of dips, today we are on 40k.

No, cases are trending up week on week, you're just comparing two different weekdays as if after almost 2 years into the pandemic we still haven't realized it doesn't make sense.

UK's healthcare system right now is just about under as much stress as the German one right now, in terms of patients, admissions, and deaths; 150-200 daily deaths in the UK are equivalent to 250ish in Germany. 

The main difference is that the trend in the UK is currently flat with minor fluctuations, while Germany and other European countries are rising. So the situation is barely sustainable - for now. I definitely wouldn't count my chickens before they hatch, the UK (and many other countries) have done it so many times during the pandemic and it mostly ended up biting them right in the ass. Not only that, but the problem with hovering at high infection/death rates with constant up and down obscillations is that it will leave you very little room to react fast in case you experience an actual long lasting surge, because it would take very little time for hospitals to get pushed past the breaking point, yet most would still dismiss it as yet another short term ripple at first.

The UK is on a risky path, which has sort of paid off so far, but I don't think you realize just how much of a knife's edge situation it is. No longer than a month ago Germany had vastly fewer cases than the UK and everyone was fretting over a surge and a potential new variant emerging in England.

Walt Disney World could have been facing fines under the policy now on hold, illustrating how even one of the most iconic tourism brands in the state has to deal with the headwinds of political debate over the pandemic response.

The Republican-controlled Florida Legislature delivered the bill blocking Covid-19 mandates on Wednesday and Gov. Ron DeSantis signed it into law on Thursday, casting the measures as an effort to protect workers who could lose their jobs for lack of compliance.

Governor DeSantis, also a Republican, has been at the forefront of the political fight to curtail mask and vaccine mandates, saying the push against those restrictions counters overreach from the federal government. “Nobody should lose their job due to heavy-handed COVID mandates and we had a responsibility to protect the livelihoods of the people of Florida,” the governor said in a statement.

The Biden administration has ordered vaccinations for workers in large companies and members of the federal work force, but the effort has met resistance across the country. Florida is among states that have challenged federal mandates in court.

The new Florida law prohibits employers from enforcing strict vaccine mandates, allowing employees to choose exemptions that include health or religious concerns, pregnancy or anticipated pregnancy, and having had the virus and recovered from it. Unvaccinated workers could instead undergo periodic testing or wear protective equipment, at the employers’ cost. Fines for violation could cost $10,000 a day per employee violation for businesses with fewer than 99 employees or up to $50,000 per employee violation for larger businesses.

Government entities and school districts are also restricted by the Covid mandate ban.

Disney World had struck a deal with employees to require theme park workers be fully vaccinated against Covid to keep their jobs, and the company defended that rule in a statement Saturday. “We believe that our approach to mandatory vaccines has been the right one as we’ve continued to focus on the safety and well-being of our Cast Members and Guests,” the statement said in part.

More than 90 percent of active cast members in Florida had verified they were vaccinated, the company said, before it sent a memo to employees halting the mandate.

Walt Disney’s website tells visitors it has been “very intentional and gradual” in operating safely, recommending guests exercise caution: wearing face coverings, checking for symptoms and getting the shots. “We encourage people to get vaccinated,” it says.",,,,1637483449,{},hlhlfpd,True,t3_qyqnpe,False,False,t3_qyqnpe,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qyqnpe/disney_halts_vaccine_mandate_for_theme_park/hlhlfpd/,1637836526.0,31,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_3nelaphm,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Organizers considered a strong showing necessary to prove that they were a force to be reckoned with.

But the paltry turnout  in Rome — a few thousand vaccine skeptics decrying “dictatorship” at a protest at the Circus Maximus  — and the inability of demonstrators in Milan to dominate, or even reach, squares where they lacked a permit, again showed that the opponents of the health pass are a small  minority, and not a powerful movement. 

Nevertheless, police officers were out in force to protect shops and prevent  violence. Store owners have lamented that the protests disrupt business, especially as Christmas shopping is ramping up.

After an initial large rally in Rome in October that was hijacked by violent neofascists and a burst of activity in Trieste, a northeastern port city, the demonstrations have diminished. Italy suffered through one of the world’s worst outbreaks early in the pandemic, and by now, most of the Italian public has embraced vaccination. And while the country is experiencing part of the Europe-wide surge in cases, the bump in its caseload has been relatively small.

Roberto Burioni, a leading virologist at San Raffaele University in Milan, attributed Italy’s success in keeping down its Covid numbers partly to its aggressive vaccination campaign — more than 73 percent of the population is fully inoculated — and partly to its early intervention with the health pass. Requiring that certificate, known as a Green Pass, has allowed Italy to avoid more draconian measures, he said, such as the nationwide lockdown being imposed in Austria starting next week.

Mr. Burioni also said the strict measures in the Green Pass, which is required for entry into bars and clubs, had perhaps motivated Italy’s younger people to get vaccinated.

“What is surprising is the rate of vaccination for people between 19 and 29,” he said, putting the rate at nearly 84 percent. “It is very high.”

As Italian officials continued to urge people to get inoculated against the virus, the government on Friday reported success in delivering third vaccine doses to people, with 160,000 doses administered in 24 hours. But roughly 6.7 million Italians over age 12 remain unvaccinated, in a country of just over 60 million people.
When the Green Pass was introduced last month, it was the toughest such measure in Europe, requiring the entire Italian work force to  be vaccinated, have recovered from the virus or have frequent negative tests to earn a paycheck.

The government has said that it has no plans to toughen up the pass. But some top ministers and many politicians in the country’s northern regions, which share border with Austria and other countries in which cases are soaring, are urging that the swab option be taken away, essentially mandating vaccinations.",,,,1637482830,{},hlhkmf6,True,t3_qyqj0z,False,False,t3_qyqj0z,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qyqj0z/protests_against_italys_health_pass_fizzle/hlhkmf6/,1637836107.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_3nelaphm,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There may be a few reasons for this. 

 sickness of all types is highly prevalent everywhere. We had incapable health care before Covid, it a just a lot worse now.

we don't have the resources to test, South Africa is still ok, but Zimbabwe, Uganda and so forth we have no idea.

It is such a convuluted means of different healthcare systems, traditional beliefs, Mega Church Pasters, own agendas.

We actually don't know what the state is, and news that creeps out is very little. 

Then we have to deal with the societal stigma of being sick, it's deep routed, and highly unfortunate.

The only metric we can generally reliably work on even here in South Africa could be the sharp increases in Excess deaths, over baseline.

For every person who makes it to a test there are at least 100 that don't. 

We can also see there has been a sudden drop off of people getting vaccines, once the wave of people who knew what a vaccine was, was vaccinated, it's just dropped off. 

Our government is trying to have events, to get people vaccined, they even giving them money / food vouchers as motivation. 

We know it's bad, we know it's a matter of time, it's just impossible to do a PCR test on everyone everywhere.

It's coming, there is a reason that, a lot of infectious diseases originate here.

This is just my 2c

Many cared extensively at the beginning of the pandemic and their efforts were very commendable. However, as people got vaccinated the focus seemed to shift from we need to do this to help the community to I'm vaccinated and these are my freedoms, I deserve xyz. 

Now, many did not change their routine and habits in the beginning of the pandemic because of their ""freedoms"". Many people were very mad about this and called them greedy. However, now many of the same people who chastised them are announcing since they are vaccinated and now they deserve xyz. What changed? Many were vaccinated so their perogative changed. Why? Is it because they are safe now so it doesn't matter to them?

Continuing measures isn't just about unvaccinated people... It flattens the curve so our health care workers aren't overwhelmed. It protected those that are vaccinated and immunocompromised. It protects the older population who are still vulnerable even with vaccination. It protects those that are vaccinated and will go on to get long covid regardless. It keeps hospital space open for those who don't have covid related problems like a heart attack. It reduces breakthrough infections. It reduces the formation of new variants till we know more about the virus. It gives more time to figure out solutions and the science. 

Western countries have been acting entitled about their freedoms like we deserve everything. Look at some of the Asian cultures like Taiwan. They follow the measurements for the greater good of everyone. Sure, it sucks but they know a couple years of their lives gives away to many families that will enjoy the rest of their lives together.

My friends mother just passed away from covid. She was fully vaccinated. Her daughter said its ridiculous we have to live like this once vaccinated and went back to normal life. Well, she infected her mother and her mother died. Yes, she was 63. However, it destroyed the family. 

This gives rise to a bigger question. Is this a bigger systemic problem in the west, particularly the United States? Will we always feel entitled to our freedoms over the common wealth? Is this why are politics become so divided we cannot think together in either side? The tragedy of the commons is like a metaphor for the United States way of thinking nowadays. 

My grandmother is quite old. She lived through a very bad round of polio where she lived in the United States. I asked her how she handled it because I was complaining how unfair it was I was missing college. She said, my community decided it was for the better good to pull kids from school and try to reduce spread in the towns. She said she was sent off to a farm. I asked how long were you there? She said, I don't even know it was many years, during which I saw almost no one. I said that sounds horrible you probably missed so much, and she said we don't always get what we want but what we need. Then she said, it helped so many people to take these measures. She went on to say I'm old enough that if I die it doesn't matter, but it brings me great sadness how this pandemic is going. She said, I see young people dying and people laughing about it. To which she said, when this happened during polio no one laughed that is a life no matter who it is. To add, both my grandparents are very conservative and they don't understand these massive complaints about freedom and what people want. I thought that was really interesting. They both said, younger generations haven't learned the sacrifices life includes. My grandma then said don't feel like you deserve anything. I then thought back to my childhood. My grandparents saved every ice cream pale, glass jar, scrap wood cause they grew up with that as a necessity. 

I guess I am glad I had someone to pass these lessons on to me and I understand many people haven't. I just like to share. 

Am I scrutinizing everyone? No. Everyone struggles, I have struggled with this. I have thought many times to myself why does it matter it doesn't effect me. I definitely have felt lost in the depths on this especially during the loneliness of the pandemic. A weird example I always think of is quite trivial as it is when I was living in an apartment complex with shared dryers. No one would clean out the lint or just throw it on the ground because the garbage was far away. I remember thinking why does it matter someone else will clean it? Well, I thought about how it felt to me everytime I had to clean it and thought what if we all just did our part no matter how small. It's stupid yes, but it applies to life overall in a broader manner. Beyond this, I tried to do my part with the dryers. Well many didn't and one day one caught on fire. It nearly burned down the building with 500 people in it. Luckily someone happened to walk past it at 2am and see the fire cause someone stole the batteries out of the smoke detector in the laundry room. Even these small decisions can make rippling impacts. 

Imagine if we collectively worked toward a better common goal. We could accomplish so much more and as a society in many retrospects if we were willing to make some sacrifices. 

Everyone pretends like we have to sacrifice our freedoms to do this, but does freedom not come without sacrifices?

Yes, this will become endemic. However, we are not there yet so why act like it? Once the science catches up we will be in a much better place. Also, yes I recognize it's not fair people are being foolish and not getting vaccinated... It makes those out us that are spiteful. Should we wish death upon them though?

Everyone is talking vaccines, but that's a sideshow. Unless the R number is maintained below 1 it will continue to spread and infect throughout the community, and with a population spreading it on because they ""don't feel that ill"" you can guarantee it will mutate into a form that evades the vaccine - and then we are back to square one with an endemic, deadly, disease.

This is the opportunity to maintain and enhance measures against the spread of the virus such that R number is well below 1 and the virus dies off in the community - unable to spread and unable to mutate further. Only when you have zero cases do you open up internal to a region.

How does someone decide which parts of science are valid and which are not?

The entire idea of paying someone to push a tube down your throat so a machine can do your breathing for you?  Perfectly valid.  And you're sure no one was bought off or bribed to get that procedure approved?  When you googled up your research, it all looked sound, right? 

Radiation for cancer.  Your hair falls out.  Your immune system gets curbstomped.  But, no worries there either? 

The pile of vaccines you got when you were a child?

Xrays.  Your doc puts you in front of the emitter and hides until it's over.  No questions?  That one wasn't pushed through by a secret cabal bent on world domination?  You sure?  How are you sure?  

You piloted a ton and a half of steel at speeds where the only thing giving you a chance of not needing to wet vac'ed out of the wreck if you hit something is more science, just to be able to get that xray.  All that stuff is fine too?   The computer controlling your throttle?  The computer controlling your brakes?  Certainly not a hidden conspiracy to control how you drive or whether you live or die, amirite?

Then due to the pandemic that clinic was closed for several months. Once it was back up, the nodules had grown and the treatment was no longer suitable, so she died.

So that would mean 90% of 4m are unvaccinated as they claimed 10% of people over 12 are not, which is equal to 400,000. So we’ll say 1.4m are unvaccinated with the knowledge that the very young age portion of that is extremely unlikely to catch or be hospitalized by Covid. 

So to clarify the context of the article above. Using the source below from Gallup, unvaccinated hospitalization risk is &lt;1%. So even if we use 1% then this epidemic (assuming that hospital capacity is what Ireland is referencing as the main subject burden) is presumably being caused by &lt;14000 people, knowing that this figure is 70% people under the age of 14, as that’s the figure I found available per their 2016 census, and that some amount have already had Covid or been hospitalized. Just find that interesting when broken out.

I can’t blame Biden. The same way I didn’t blame Trump. This stupid virus is unlike anything we’ve ever seen. Was it mismanaged? Absolutely! A few things stood out: 

1) Too many immunologists, doctors, and non-immunologists and doctors who believed they were and whose opinion was respected, were speaking out and making recommendations. And so everyone then had an opinion and a mother’s friend’s cousin who heard on the news about x, while someone else heard about y. 

2) the media was too trigger happy to release news. The world literally shut down, so there was nothing else to report on. So Fauci and other doctors were pestered into making recommendations, sometimes prematurely, and literally any hint of news was spun out. 

3) this virus happened during an election year. Don’t get me started on the con$piracy theories, but then it was politicized beyond belief.

If having a sense of normality (i.e. going to restaurants or to a baseball game) requires vaccinating, then I'm willing to take the vaccine every six months if needed. It's either that or having to live with worse restrictions than those who either haven't vaxxed or those who vaxxed long time ago. Also:

&gt; plenty of cases coming from those vaxxed 6+ months ago.

Cases happen on vaxxed people as well, this was shown when Delta came. The thing is that hospitalizations and the risk of death is cut. Sure, hospitalizations may rise because of that, so it's in the hands of those who vaxxed take their boosters as well. Israel did that and it worked, since their last wave settled down very quickly.

I can understand people who took their vaccine a while ago, it's antivaxxers who haven't done their part since the beginning that frustrates me. The last straw would be if the Merck/Pfizer pill came out and they still wouldn't trust it.

The most straightforward and obvious option for a country with universal public healthcare is to simply deny treatment to voluntarily unvaccinated patients.   


There are all kinds of procedures public healthcare won't cover by default. It should be sufficient to propose a law that goes:  
\- if you're of age A and don't have grounds G1 through Gn, the state health authority will not provide treatment to for complications arising from Covid-19 infection.  


Hell, you don't even have to go as far as refusing treatment. You could simply say that if and when triage is required, you may be deprioritized.  


At the end of the day, the person can then decide how they want to mitigate that risk. Ideally, they get the vaccine. But maybe they just never leave the house. Maybe they do nothing and end up getting the disease (and like most people experience nothing more than a day feeling kinda shitty).

But these vaccines are in a different class. They use mRNA which has never been tried before. I don't know if or when side effects will occur, but there seem to be some issues with myocarditis and some nuerological problems reported.. My main argument was that I don't think a partially effective vaccine that might require long term boosters demands a mandatory status.

&gt;The only other side effect we would expect would be ADE, and we’ve seen ZERO of that.

None that has been proven. There are some minor reports here and there that ADE might be a slight issue. This might have something to with the N protein. There was a report on twitter (I can't find the source) that seemed to suggest that antibodies against the N protein are important if people want a vaccine that works. With ADE, there aren't enough neutralizing antibodies to completely incapacitate the virus, so it might lead to a slightly enhanced effect. This might also take place because of the waning antibodies. The research doesn't seem to be complete yet. ADE may not be a worry, but the data seems more convincing that the vaccine could be less than 50% efficacy within 2 years.

&gt;FYI that many childhood vaccines became mandatory within years or less of their being released.

It would be easy to look up instead of badgering us.  Rudely.

Hospitals are preparing to go into ""Code Black"" where they are going to have to leave some to die due to lack of treatment.

Now, most of us don't really want people to die in the corridors of overloaded hospitals, so the lockdowns.

I'm sort of missing where you're coming from.  Is it that you have a better solution to the fact that there are more new cases than our hospital system can handle?  Is it that you don't care if a lot of people die due to lack of medical treatment?

We know a lot about the virus and accompanying disease, much more now than we did in the beginning. As time has gone by, we’ve learned that surface contamination is far less of a concern than shared air, and all sorts of other important things. 

Unfortunately, the virus has mutated into the Delta variant, which means that what used to protect us from infection, now mostly protects us from hospitalization and death. This is why we need boosters, to bring our protection from infection back up to the levels we initially saw with the first variant. 

The nature of scientific knowledge requires that it change as new information comes to light.

By the same standard, it’s not fair to foist this responsibility onto business owners either. But this is already the case wherever these policies have been instituted.

That article is shooting down a strawman version of perfect ever lasting sterilising immunity. That's not needed to achieve population immunity. As they say:

&gt; The smallpox vaccine wasn’t sterilizing; it still helped us eradicate a pathogen.

Same with measles and other diseases that are generally absent but can occasionally be reintroduced and cause small outbreaks among the unvaccinated and then die out.

But for covid that seems to require very high levels of triple or more vaccination to achieve, if at all possible. And even if everyone cooperates then it'll take months and people are decidedly not cooperating. 

Meanwhile covid is still not a disease that can be given free rein in a third of the population plus whatever is the probability of breakthrough or reinfection.

Everyone in this thread will probably get it (whether asymptomatic or symptomatic) at some point in their lives.

What we can do is vaccinated which brings death/complications levels very low.

Again, makes no sense. First, it's not like the Netherlands didn't ""stick"" with it - cases just went down naturally because the wave burned through the susceptible population.

Plus, Spain also had a massive surge that went down fast, and the situation is now quiet. Not sure what you're implying here.

&gt;But epidemiologists also believe that relying on vaccines alone is not enough. Gupta says that even as we attempt to find a way to live with Covid-19 in the UK, there should still be some restrictions in place to limit the spread of the virus and reduce the number of opportunities it gets to mutate.

&gt;”The case numbers are so high at the moment that it’s much better to prevent new infections,” says Gupta. “In other words, we shouldn’t be wandering around in crowded places, in buildings without masks on, even though it’s hard to do. If you look at the variants we’ve had, they have all emerged in countries with very high, uncontrolled transmission – India, the UK, Brazil. There’s a reason why we haven’t heard of a Singaporean or South Korean variant.”

&gt;It is a philosophy many of his colleagues agree with. “You want to limit the number of opportunities that the virus gets to roll the dice,” says Hanage. “With natural selection, you’re basically talking about the most creative force that we know of when it comes to solving problems. It’s amazing. And so this is why you’d never bet against it. We expect the virus to keep evolving.”

This is a reason to not allow cases to go as high as the UK has done since the summer.

However, I haven't received Moderna before and just concerned about any potential risks. Which is better?

Secondly, I've also read and watched a lot of videos talking about concern about why the pharmacist or nurse should ""aspirate"" the needle before injecting to possibly prevent serious problems.. how can I figure out which pharmacies in the U.S aspirate before doing the injection?

[],,mikeright25,,,,,,[],"I have a nurse friend that wants Longitudinal studies before taking any vax...

I'm like.. If the leading physicians IN THE WORLD have read the current studies and got their vax.. Were there Longitudinal studies before the people got the first measle vaccine? I think we can surely agree this is not a matter of Longitudinal studies that require years of time. We are in a pandemic, still; with a novel virus that is extremely contagious, has killed millions, &amp; rapidly mutates. The less it is able to transmit to a different host (human) the less it has the ability to mutate, right? You can either be a guinea pig with fighting the virus without a vaccine or have one that has already proven to the satisfaction of the world's leading scientists &amp; doctors. Either way we're guinea pigs. About 460 million vaccine shots have been given in the US from the 3 most trusted vaccines. In the time constraint that we have, what testing would make you feel more comfortable? I feel like once they pool all the data together, we will have literally the largest vaccine study ever. 

Here's a current look at the numbers:
Current analysis puts unvaccinated at around 12+x more likely to be hospitalized &amp; on Average around 20x more likely (multiple sources).

""The protective effect of vaccination was most noticeable among younger groups. During September, the risk of COVID-19 death was **23 times** higher in unvaccinated people in their 30s and 55 times higher for unvaccinated people in their 40s.
...Then, looking at a longer time period -- from Jan. 15 to Oct. 1 -- the researchers found that **unvaccinated people were 45 times more likely to contract COVID-19** than fully vaccinated people.""

Here's my advice: ask a local doctor that you trust with your life. The math says he's already vaccinated,ask him/her why.

[],,Irisgrower2,,,,,,,"For 9 months I prepared for a hip replacement that was postponed indefinitely 3 days before it was to occur due to the hospital needing beds for the unvaccinated. The ripple effects in my life will be humongous.

 I'm a farmer. These next few months are my quite time, when I could take the time off. Next spring I'll either be recovering from surgery or still waiting, unable to move around. Early spring to early summer is my busiest time of year. Effectively my whole season will be shot. I planned out cortisone shots through out this year so I could get things buttoned up on the land. Knowing I wouldn't be able to carry in firewood for the stove I stacked enough inside to make it into the new year. I mounted the winter tires on my truck so my wife could use it to commute these next few weeks while I recovered. The chains and plow are hooked up to the tractor so I could clear the way for her during the snowy part of the year but I won't be able to do that now.

The insurance deductable we'd strategized to meet isn't happening so that's more bills next year. My wife's cancelled interviews for a new employer because qualifying for insurance can take time.

I will continue to be in physical agony until the hip replacement. The financial agony of putting food on the dinner table (not figuratively, I mean growing it) will be real. Hiring a farm hand, someone to plow, I'm not even sure if I'll be able to take my dog outside during the day, all this is very real. 

As a farmer the whole ""social isolation"" thing hasn't done much to my lifestyle. I've left the property slightly less often then before the virus. I've worn a mask because it's the decent thing to do. I've done that because it's a civic duty. I got my shots because as independent as I tell myself I am I know it's an interdependent world. My area had relatively low case numbers through out the pandemic. Now the test positives and hospitalized are at the highest they have ever been.

I don't know how to end this post. I'm bitter and angry and sad and scared.

I can't get under 12s stats but even if 50% of under 12s took the vaccine (low estimate) the stats show that the Irish population is HIGHLY HIGHLY vaccinated yet the virus continues to spread like wildfire since easing of restrictions for VACCINATED people: [https://www.google.com/search?-b-d&amp;q=ireland+covid+chart](https://www.google.com/search?-b-d&amp;q=ireland+covid+chart)

The Irish population has close to a 90% vaccination rate all while government mandates stop the small unvaccinated population from going to cinemas, restaraunts, pubs etc through the use of COVID certificates: [https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel\_and\_recreation/travel\_abroad/digital\_covid\_certificate.html](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_abroad/digital_covid_certificate.html)

And this isn't even counting people with natural immunity who caught the virus and recovered!!

Any logical person must therefore conclude that while vaccinated people are at less risk of death and hospitalisation they DO still SPREAD the virus at a very high rate and the unvaccinated cannot be demonised as the sole spreaders of the virus anymore.

Any other opinion is clearly politicaly motivated and not based in reality of the evidence.

Unfortunately if a population had a 100% vaccination rate the virus would still be spreading without other measures/treatments.

Everything is open.  Well, open enough.

Except they haven't lifted the final capacity restrictions on certain types of venues.  ( They're limited to like 50% capacity for restaurants and bars. )

Everyone still wears masks at stores.

Desk jockeys work from home.

I can't find an indoor soccer game to play - because of the capacity limits and kids are first in line for that (as is appropriate, if us men get desperate we can go play outdoors in the wold - like we made the Mexican national team do in Edmonton last weekend.

The problem is when you have ZERO restrictions - like the Netherlands I presume - somehow the Netherlands has managed to see saw between ""full lockdown"" and ""wild west open"".

The problem with full full opening and zero restrictions of any kind - is that even with 20% of the population unimmunized - you'll overwhelm your hospitals for 3-6 months straight.  Certain American states have chosen this path.

Anyone who chooses that path - will have between 300% and 500% more deaths than the rest of us:

So let's be really really clear about this.  Each country is choosing between:

* ""figure out how to get orce our citizens vaccinated and act a bit differently""
* 1700 additional deaths per million people (above where they are right now).

So everything that is happening in the Netherlands right now (population 17.5 million) - is them arguing with themselves on letting 30,000 more people die or not.",,,,1637511008,{},hliu1jk,False,t3_qy9pdy,False,True,t1_hlip4zj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qy9pdy/dutch_police_open_fire_on_covid_lockdown/hliu1jk/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_3fakm,False,False,,False,648f963e00784b1a0ecf108c401632dca3e45a6e,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1637511026.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

This hasn't been proven yet. They haven't given out enough doses. There are other countries that are putting a hold on that, which says that there is enough reason to be cautious.

Because those vaccines have a decent track record for safety, and they weren't rushed through. They probably took 10-15 years before they made them mandatory. 

&gt;Tell me in your own words why the antibodies against nucleocapsid proteins matter.

Because they've done immune tests for reactivity, and found the N protein is displayed high. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33515911/

Virtually every argument about trying to do anything to solve this problem hinges on reducing it all down to one point while ignoring any other point. 

The whole reason this is a pandemic in the first place is because of the aggregate of several qualities of this coronavirus; ease of transmission, average length of infection, average severity of infection, rate of asymptomatic spread, rate of hospitalization and death rate. All intensified by no real treatment options initially and unusual cases that elevate the risks of long-term damage across a variety of internal organs. 

It's all of these things at once that make this situation what it is. But the people arguing against vaccines or against masks or against social distancing all they ever do is pick one point and go ""well this isn't 100% perfect so we obviously can't do anything!""

So, at first glance its pretty safe and you dont have to give anyone access to a ""vaccine registry"". The information is in the QR code.  

Since its nearly impossible to fake these codes, we have atleast 2 ways to get a valid qr code matching your ID.  
\#1 you fake your little yellow vaccine record book, change the cover or whatever, and visit a pharmacy which will create you a QRcode.  
\#2 you have corrupt people who are working at an official place, which can create these qr codes. Most likely your telegram people, but I really hope a lot of scammers are in these groups.     

You also dont need the app. Its enough to print out the QR code, maybe laminate it, and be good with low battery.  

I think its time we stop accepting the little yellow books and stop allowing pharmacies to create QR codes. By now everyone had enough time to get his code.  

But regulations and vaccine mandates will bring people to buy fakes. Its much easier to get your fake then to wait at least 5 weeks to be fully vaccinated.  
With our latest law, we also got some hefty fines and jailtime.

Right now we have some problems, revoking these QRcodes. But since they only last for a year anyway ... lets see how good/long these booster shots will do.

Also, antibodies don't always kill a virus. They use 4 different methods to get rid of pathogens. The more appropriate word is probably neutralize.

* And say that population has 1000 COVID cases in hospital.
* If 100 of those people are vaccinated and 900 are unvaccinated, that would equate to a clickbait headline of **""10% of hospitalisations are vaccinated""**

“Neutralizing antibodies primarily target S protein in coronaviruses, in particular the S1 subunit and the RBD contained within the S1 subunit, preventing viral entry into the host cell. Authors of a recent study conducted by the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center concluded that serological testing using the S1 protein including the RBD is needed to identify individuals with neutralizing antibodies. Researchers warned against serology tests that only confirmed the presence of antibodies against N protein, which may mislead people to falsely believe that they have potential immunity against re-infection. In SARS-CoV-2, there is a heterogeneous IgG response to the S1-RBD and N proteins and these responses do not always correlate with each other. In this study, patients with antibodies to the N protein and not the S1-RBD, failed to exhibit neutralizing antibodies. Additionally, the neutralizing capacity was higher in patients with antibodies against the S1-RBD compared to N protein (86% versus 74%). Furthermore, the rate of healthy individuals positive for antibodies against the N protein was higher compared with the S1-RBD (3% versus 1%). Overall, this indicates that antibodies against the N protein portrays prior exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 or related viruses, and not necessarily is an indicator of presence of neutralizing antibodies.”",,,,1637451844,{},hlg28if,False,t3_qy63cy,False,False,t1_hlg1sy8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qy63cy/europe_is_learning_a_crucial_lesson_vaccines_work/hlg28if/,1637807747.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_1m8xz0hz,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,Sao_Gage,,,,,,[],"This is a comment I made on another subreddit regarding this issue:

The misconceptions about the vaccines stems from the fact that they originally conferred strong protective immunity against the original and Alpha variant. Delta came along and with its tremendously increased virulence combined with the passage of time causing natural antibody attrition, and now the vaccinated are much more likely to both test positive and be symptomatic vs where things were at a year ago.

From early studies the boosters appear to bring the level of protective immunity back up considerably, though of course it just simply isn’t to 100%.

This nuance has neither been well communicated nor well understood by the general public and it’s the reason we’re seeing so much confusion and surprise when people test positive.

Of course, thankfully, protection against severe illness has remained at a much higher level than infection resistance. However even now I’m reading that fully vaxxed but unboosted individuals (mainly in higher age brackets) are unfortunately suffering an uptick in progression to more severe COVID, which is why they’re now really pushing to get people their boosters.

There’s also a misconception now in the other direction where people are acting like the COVID vaccines were never developed with preventative immunity in mind, but that just isn’t accurate. But it’s coming from a place of helping to remind people to be cautious and continue to practice COVID countermeasures regardless of vaccination status (which is the right thing), so it’s not particularly problematic.",,,,1637451445,{},hlg1d7b,False,t3_qy9hy8,False,False,t1_hlf0ry3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qy9hy8/too_late_some_question_why_boosters_werent/hlg1d7b/,1637807281.0,54,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_jh7b6,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A lot of people (not saying this is you) think that being exposed to filth, not washing their hands, catching a virus, etc. Will improve their immune system response overall. People are stupid. This is not true.

In theory, if you've had a coronavirus, especially recently, you will have some experience in fighting off covid-19 - and maybe that's part of the puzzle with who gets hit hard and not. Sure.

Everyone differs and when your body deals with a virus it's using experience and trial and error to deal with it every time.

The covid vaccines work by introducing the threat and then when you get the second shot it's like checking to make sure the body has worked out how to deal with it. When you catch a virus, your body doesn't get an easy introduction and a follow up course. It just has to throw everything at the wall and see what sticks, or doesn't. It's incredibly inefficient and the result isn't necessarily better at dealing with the virus in question in the future.

My point is just that this idea that ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"" is horseshit. It's probably the opposite. Your immune system post dealing with a bad infection is not better.

My hospital is in the red and has been for a while because travelers cost 3-5x what staff nurses do and it's not sustainable for the long term.  It's not cutting into executive bonuses, it's cutting into the bottom line.  The other complicating factor is that procedures and operations are the big money makers for the hospital, always have been.  Covid has ground those to a halt multiple times due to us locking down elective procedures, due to risk, but primarily due to bed shortages.  We literally can't room people when we have so many Covids on the floor.
