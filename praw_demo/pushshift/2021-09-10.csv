Unlike with covid, there’s no magical vaccine to avoid obesity. Someone who’s obese can’t just go to a pharmacy right now and pick up a vaccine to cure them if their obesity before they end up in the hospital. It takes months of effort, at the absolute minimum, to get to a healthy weight. For the severely obese, it usually takes years. An obese person might be doing everything right to try and fix their weight when they end up in the hospital- because it’s not a single/two part shot that decrease their chance of severe illness.

Obesity is a major problem we need to address, but we have decades upon decades of not teaching young Americans how to eat healthily nor take care of themselves.

There’s also the larger fact- obesity isn’t contagious. Someone who’s eaten themself into needing a bypass doesn’t affect me or my health. I don’t have to worry they’re going to breathe near my immunocompromised grandma and kill her. They’re not spreading their obesity via aerosols to everyone around them, pushing hospitals over capacity. They’re just affecting themselves.

It’s literally nothing alike. I think we need to push better programs to get Americans healthy, including subsidizing healthy food if need be. Gym memberships even. But I still have no problem in someone obese getting health care.

I do have a problem with anti-vaxxers who are spreading the virus rampantly, taking up hospital beds from people who need it. Why? Because all they had to do was get a shot. A free one. That’s it.

Some people are so hateful to others, they are not asking for extra money from anyone. I see people commenting and being rude, and calling them names. 

If u cannot get a vaccine based on religion, or cannot get one for medical reasons, and ur fired, this is 100% wrong. They should receive unemployment. 

But to put blanket statements out there saying they r hypocrites, or leeches for collecting unemployment, u r wrong. What u pay in should be what u receive. What people were upset about is when they were being paid unemployment passed what they put in, and on top of it collecting pandemic relief money. And some refusing to work because they were able to collect for a year and make more than they would have if they were working.

I’m actually pleased to see so many being forced to pay back, if you lied about job interviews or applications, yes u should be held accountable. Many never went on weekly interviews or even called to ask if businesses were hiring. Yes u may not make what u did, or work in the industry u used too, but a job is a job, making money vs collecting and not doing what ur supposed to be doing, which was looking for work still. 

Heck I saw some asking is ebt was accepted in other countries and that they were taking a vacation to some island. 🤦‍♀️ this is what upsets people. Ur collecting unemployment to survive and save if possible to pay bills, but like I said some abused it.

The problem is not everyone abused the situation, many collected for legitimate reasons. But because there were a some refusing to return to work for reasons like fear, or because they were getting twice as much as they made, caused many to get upset and rightfully so. 

We’ve been understaffed for a year, since unemployment ended, now people are randomly coming in asking if we are hiring, almost daily. This is the sad reality of many businesses.

But wow, everyone is just so hateful, or calling people hypocrites, when they are not looking at both sides of a situation or refusing to believe there r more perspectives than their own, is kinda sad. 

I swear people never cease to amaze me, so many assume they know what other people are saying. Or judge a group based on the actions of a few. 🤦‍♀️ it is exhausting, not every Republican is the same, not every Democrat is the same, this is not about politics yet somehow, it turns into it. It is just disheartening to see so many people immediately say it is anti-vaxxers that are causing this and that, or now want handouts. There are anti-vaxxers on both political sides, I know a lot of dems who are against it for many reasons.

I have friends in the medical field who medically cannot get the vax, and they could lose their jobs. They are not anti-vaxxers, so they should be able to collect unemployment. They even worked thru the pandemic in covid wards, well before their was a vaccine. 

Anyone making immediate assumptions and saying people shouldn’t collect because they aren’t being vaxxed, speaks volumes. 

You are judging others, and this is just sad. I’m not judging you for saying what you have, simply showing u how u are perceived by others, and to maybe ask yourself to be kinder to one another or not put out blanket statements about one group.",,,,1631378118,{},hcg9izt,False,t3_plpg6t,False,False,t3_plpg6t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/plpg6t/fact_check_workers_fired_for_refusing_a_vaccine/hcg9izt/,1631474679.0,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We started buying nitrile gloves and masks and the last week in February we went to the grocery store and bought $1100 worth of canned goods, ramen, and other stuff that would sit shelf stable for a while. When Italy really went to shit I told my kids “I’ve never seen this in my lifetime. This is very serious.” Starting in March my wife’s doctors told her to not leave the house and that only one of us should do any additional shopping, so I was masked up from that point on. 

I am also ecstatic that there is a vaccine and we got everyone vax’d as soon as possible. My wife’s already got her first booster and if a Delta-specific one comes out we will talk to her doctor about getting her that one too. I’m going to get my booster next week just to keep her safe.

So, let’s say that per your model, 100% of US is vaccinated, masked, and sheltered in place for a month. How would that not control the spread **in the US**? Not the 7.6 billion other people, just the 328 million here. 

An unfortunate reality is that Americans are helping spread covid due to our lack of complicity and freedom to travel. We’re the highest number of covid cases and deaths in the world, and we’re going on tour!
If we can take a baby step and clean up our act, it can make a difference abroad and at home.

What breeding grounds aren’t being covered enough? The new vaccine mandate has me hopeful that many of these will be addressed. Schools, hospitals, federal buildings, any workplace with more than 100 workers: these are the hotspots that stand out to me.

Getting rid of covid entirely does seem hopeless at this point, but controlling the spread and limiting the ability to further mutate seems like the best shot we have. Imagine if we can get the numbers down to a similar level as the flu! Even pre covid flu mortality rates (~22k-34k last two seasons) are preferable to recent covid mortality rates (~375k for 2020).

Vaccine to vaccine transmission does happen, but the lethality is less. Complications are less. 
It’s easy instead to point at the people not complying and accuse them. They ARE being selfish; they’re choosing themselves over their neighbors.

With all this covid exposure I've had over the last year, I probably got it and didn't realize. Don't worry, all my patients had covid, so I couldn't give it to anyone. And I made sure I lived alone so I wouldn't give it to anyone. I literally moved across the us to the complete opposite side a 2 day plus drive away from everyone I knew to take that job because I knew I'd be working in the thick of covid and didn't want to bring it home to someone I loved. Here I was thinking I was being exceptionally clean to not have caught it and I probably did. Break rooms taking off our masks is probably what did it. We didn't have a nurse's lounge... it was a room between the nurse's station and the locker room. High traffic area. Kinda hard not to have someone walk by when you were eating. Lunch.  Ah well. All I had happen to me was I got a sore arm. Got the 2nd after my first shift of 3. (Ended at 7:40am, got it at 10am, took some tylenol and went to bed) Didn't have a fever or nausea or vomiting or diarrhea. My arm was still hella tender. Took some more tylenol. By day 2, i could lift things with that arm and be touched in that arm and not nearly fall over in pain. (Literally a brush would have me hurting bad on night 1. I work 7p-7a) Now day 3, it only hurts if i press on it. All i had throughout was a mild headache each day that went away with tylenol. I know tylenol also stops fever, but i didn't have any other symptoms other than the headache. I didn't need to call out and didn't call out. We were short staffed both days. I had 10 patients and we had 2 techs for the whole floor, which meant no help with any heavy lifting. If you wanted your patients cleaned up, you'd have to do it yourself and pray they cam roll. They can't hold their leg up for a dressing change? Better improvise and find something to prop their leg up on. Need a boost up in bed? Good luck... But yeah, no symptoms from the vaccine yet day 3 other than a headache and tenderness in the injection site. Guess I had it already.  I don't think I would have even gotten paid time off as I'm a travel nurse, not staff. 
My other job where I probably caught it? They didn't give extra PTO if you got sick. They used your PTO to pay you for working holidays, why'd they give you sick time for catching covid. If you caught it, you were on your own. Glad I left. The staff was nice, the way the hospital handled the staff kinda sucked. No unions in that hospital in ND, so they can get away with it. I was planning on getting it before, but I still had my NY insurance, and I'd have to go to the er for insurance coverage out of network. I went to get my ""free"" shot and they asked if I had ins. I didn't with me as it was supposed to be free and the lady just looked at me like I was stupid and sent me on my way. I wouldn't have time off for the shot anyway and wouldn't have gotten paid time off for getting sick. Call in sick and you get grilled and they ask you harshly why you're sick, what symptoms you have and what you're doing about the symptoms... and your first day comes from your already non-existent PTO... gotta love Dakota. 
When I came back to NY, the Gov't had already made sure no one was charging for the vaccine or the administration of the vaccine, so I went to cvs. There was no day I wouldn't work 28 days after the vaccine, so my 2nd shot came in the middle of my work week, Haha.

At this point infection followed by a single dose of mRNA vaccine has shown to result in the best breadth of antibodies. These antibodies are capable of neutralizing multiple lab-created escape variants, and can even neutralize SARS-Cov-1, which I find fascinating.

There’s also some evidence that people who have received doses of vaccine of different types (ie. AstraZeneca and then Moderna) have better antibodies than those who have received two identical doses.

What they do treat was already known and was a little bit understood before COVID. Inflammation. A complication of severe illness but not the illness or virus itself. That leaves little need for discovery and approval as it's already approved to treat inflammation. It only needs studying for use in patients with COVID because it can also suppress the immune system.

So why might Corticosteroids be approved for treatment of COVID but X isn't? Probably because Corticosteroids aren't treating COVID. Even if it was treating COVID, it wouldn't be its only use in COVID patients.

Communism is the broadly the idea that in addition to establishing a socialist economy, we should work towards abolishing the state. (I know looking at most of the communist governments that have existed, that might not seem to be reflected in their actions, but that is broadly, the theory. It is just, they would argue, reshaping society is very difficult, so you must use a strong hand and someday, we will have achieved our goals and the state will just go away) (sorry if you can see my bias, I'm not a communist)

The United States is a capitalist economy. This means that, broadly, there are two social classes, workers (the ""proletariat""), who make living by doing work (making things, providing services, generally depending on being paid consistently a wage for work) and the capitalist class (the ""bourgeois"") who make a living by owning things (yes, some members of the capitalist class do managerial work, but they could delegate this others and not have to work) and are able to direct, as they see fit (within the law) how the businesses are run. Welfare programs still allow private ownership of means of production, so really, even if you have a ton of welfare, that doesn't really have anything to do with socialism.

(There also is the, I know confusingly named, political idea of ""social democracy"" which calls for strong intervention by democratic government into the economy. This has historical roots in socialist politics, but modern social democracts want a capitalist economy, so they aren't socialists.)

Admittedly, these terms are used differently sometimes than I have described because leftist politics have shifted around quite a lot over time and various parties who might agreed in the past now have different views but similar names (for instance, the party the Bolsheviks were part of was the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party: certainly they didn't follow what I described as social democracy!).

It’s not their fault they don’t understand what the central dogma of biology is, that it’s impossible for the mRNA to enter your genome because that would require a reverse transcriptase (which if they could such an enzyme that was that specific and nom-immunogenic would be absolutely fascinating and would throw crispr cas9 to the wayside, definitely Nobel fast track). The role of a good and well intentioned physician is to educate, that’s all.

For anyone that has just been on unemployment, ESPECIALLY those that have exhausted standard benefits, in many States you will need to earn a minimum total amount before being eligible again.

Here is [CT's rule](https://www.ctdol.state.ct.us/progsupt/unemplt/claimant-guide/uc-288.pdf) for example:

&gt;Base Period - The 12-month period from which wages are used to calculate entitlement is called your base period. Your wages during a specific 12-month period will determine your weekly benefit amount. The base period, determined by law, is the first four of the last
five completed calendar quarters. The alternate base period, which is only used when you do not qualify in the regular base period, is the four calendar quarters immediately preceding the quarter in which the claim is filed.

&gt;The weekly benefit rate will be calculated based upon one twenty-sixth (1/26) of the average of total wages paid during the two highest quarters in the applicable base period. If you have wages in only one quarter, those wages will be averaged with the second highest
quarter, which will be zero. If you have less than $600 in your total base period of earnings, then the alternate base period may be calculated the same way as shown below.

&gt;To determine if you have sufficient wage credits to establish a benefit year, **the law requires that you must have a total amount of base period earnings that equals or exceeds 40 times the weekly benefit rate.** *(emphasis mine)* Using the weekly benefit rate of $152 noted in the example above, you would need to have earned total base period wages of $6,080 or more to qualify (this is because $152 x 40 = $6,080).

If you can't establish the minimum amount of earnings, you won't qualify for UI.  Given the number of people out of work over the past year and a half, this is going to be a lot of people.",,,,1631374185,{},hcg0jac,False,t3_plpg6t,False,True,t3_plpg6t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/plpg6t/fact_check_workers_fired_for_refusing_a_vaccine/hcg0jac/,1631469040.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the alternative of not everyone being vaxxed only makes it 1 in 5000 because the risk of infection is twice as likely in the non vaxxed.

So this is 1 in 5000, I approach 2% in 3 months.

So why should I care so much when its double chance of in/reinfection of such a small number?  And if I should care about double the size of that number, then isn't that number too big in the first place? And will likely get bigger with new variants of the virus.   


As we are only talking about contraction here not efficacy of the vaccine in relation to severity of infection.

Unfortunately, many in the pro-vax camp don't realize this, and instead of trying to find out the reasons for mistrust (some of which is political and in this case, I see little hope; others, however, has much to do with poor messaging and incompetent communication) and addressing those, they just keep repeating the statements made by the authorities and calling people idiots for not believing them.

The problem is none of the authorities are calling them idiots. That itself is misinformation, and you yourself have fallen for it. Just like them, you're conflating social media posts or media personalities agreeing with the authorities with the authorities themselves, as if a random Reddit poster or an MSNBC anchor is a spokesman for the CDC or something.

I just don't buy this claim that giving them more information will do anything.

My understanding is that generally with vaccines, a longer gap between doses leads to better immunity. Widening the time between doses was recommended here in the US also, but wasn't listened to. There's another benefit to this though - having quickly vaccinated the willing population means the waning will generally happen within a similar timeframe. Having a more a spread out vaccination period, the waning of vaccines will impact a smaller portion of the population at a time.  
  
This is conjecture but I think you could take the period of linear growth of first doses to be the rolling window of waning immunity. So, if first doses were consistent for five weeks, there would be a five week wide window of waning immunity. If first doses remained linearly utilized for, say, twelve weeks, I think they would be in a far better position than Israel, who had a huge supply relative to population.",,,,1631377574,{},hcg8ap2,False,t3_pm4m5a,False,False,t1_hcg6bpa,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pm4m5a/covid19_90_of_adults_in_republic_of_ireland_now/hcg8ap2/,1631473891.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

If we walk out, we can be fired, fined (my contract charges me thousands of dollars if I quit), and the district can go after your entire teaching certificate which would potentially remove your ability to teach… ripping away your profession. 

Even if they don’t take your certificate… every single teacher job app asks if you’ve broken a contract before, and that may as well be a “throw this application in the garbage” button. They’re going to want to talk to your former supervisor, and that principal is going to tear you a new hole when they get contacted.

[],,NoRepresentative338,,,[],,,,text,t2_81qhahpy,False,False,,"I didn’t see the post so can’t comment on it specifically but can comment on what you said about it and the tweet. And it’s fairly misleading for several reasons.

1) Reduced risk of infection and reduced risk of hospitalization/death aren’t really separate, independent events. The fact that we have vaccines that are so good that they significantly reduced people’s likelihood of even being infected is pretty critical to the vaccine’s success. The tweet doesn’t include the context on reduction in infection so it makes it seem like anyone can just get infected. But if we look at the numbers in the CDC study, in the high delta period fully vaccinated people were getting infected almost 80% LESS often than non fully vaxxed. That’s a huge reduction! So anything that happens “after infection” has to take into account that infection is much, much lower in the first place. It is saving lives right from the start.

2) The whole 1.5x more likely to go to the hospital or 2x more likely to die also downplay the numbers because they don’t take into account my first point. For the same period as mentioned before, 30% fewer infected but vaccinated people were hospitalized than non fully vaxxed. That’s a big reduction, but importantly it comes on top of 80% FEWER people being infected in the first place! These numbers start to compound, and what you end up with is the number of vaccinated people hospitalized and dying being close to zero percent.

3) The study lumped in partially vaccinated people with unvaccinated, so that likely led to a lower gap between the two groups as partially vaccinated people are likely to have a T cell response that reduces their chance of being hospitalized and dying even if their risk of infection reduced as much. The study’s authors mention this as a complicating factor in their analysis.",,,,1631382350,{},hcgjdez,False,t3_pm2lft,False,True,t1_hcg3f3r,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pm2lft/daily_discussion_thread_september_11_2021/hcgjdez/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,8f0f76615a5bad29a3e4d6f94224b2d99ab75fad,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1631382366.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Remdesivir probably makes little or no difference to deaths from any cause (4 studies, 7142 people). In 1000 people, 8 fewer die with remdesivir compared to placebo or standard care.

Did patients get better with remdesivir?

Remdesivir may have little or no effect on the length of time patients spent on invasive mechanical ventilation (2 studies, 1298 people). 
The authors do not know whether remdesivir increases or decreases time on supplemental oxygen (3 studies, 1691 people).",,,,1631385526,{},hcgqsok,False,t3_plxi07,False,True,t1_hcgkc5k,/r/Coronavirus/comments/plxi07/fact_checkthe_us_prescribes_ivermectin_to/hcgqsok/,1631486242.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

For that matter, why don't we also [take decisive action to eliminate all respiratory infections at once](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/09/coronavirus-pandemic-ventilation-rethinking-air/620000/)? 

&gt;When London vanquished cholera in the 19th century, it took not a vaccine, or a drug, but a sewage system. The city’s drinking water was intermingling with human waste, spreading bacteria in one deadly outbreak after another. A new comprehensive network of sewers separated the two. London never experienced a major cholera outbreak after 1866. All that was needed was 318 million bricks, 23 million cubic feet of concrete, and a major reengineering of the urban landscape.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The 19th and early 20th century saw a number of ambitious public-health efforts like this. The United States eliminated yellow fever and malaria, for example, with a combination of pesticides, wide-scale landscape management, and window screens that kept mosquitoes at bay. One by one, the diseases that people accepted as inevitable facts in life—dysentery, typhoid, typhus, to name a few more—became unacceptable in the developing world. But after all this success, after all we’ve done to prevent the spread of disease through water and insects, we seem to have overlooked something. We overlooked air.

Even before the pandemic there was already, there was already people pushing for recognition that in most places, the quality of indoor air is unacceptably poor. And that's without factoring in the issue of infectious disease control.

So, to get our slogans ready, let's combine ""Healthy indoor air is a human right!"" with ""healthy indoor air is pathogen-free air!"".

A huge fraction of Covid-19 transmission takes place in poorly ventilated indoor spaces. One thing we can do as individuals is get our hands on portable air quality monitors that detect C02 levels, since that's a quick way to judge quality of ventilation. Some on Amazon: [https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=portable+indoor+air+quality+monitor+C02&amp;ref=nb\_sb\_noss](https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=portable+indoor+air+quality+monitor+C02&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss)",,,,1631330452,{},hce818p,False,t3_plqxde,False,False,t1_hcdk9gt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/plqxde/massachusetts_coronavirus_breakthrough_cases_jump/hce818p/,1631432366.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think it’s important to honor the 9/11 victims and the Covid deaths and those of opioids, gun violence, hate crimes, drunk driving, war - sadly the list goes on.

I remember after 9/11 how we came together as a country. For the first time in my life (I was 24) I experienced I love and camaraderie and neighborly connection with everyone I came in contact with. People were honking their horn‘s in traffic, and weren’t impatient, or angry with each other, everywhere you went there was people being human together.  Alas this wasn’t the case with a lot of the anti-Muslim rage and actions and that was and still is unacceptable and makes me sad to this day.  

Unfortunately, today with Covid, there’s so much division. And that’s where the difference is. 650,000 dead people is a tragedy That words can’t describe. Add to that a divided nation and people literally hating, fighting or killing each other over efforts to safe lives.  That would be like people fighting the firefighters rushing into the buildings.

Conclusion People with GBS should get the vaccine. Although the study is not perfect, it is a difficult question to answer. The authors attempt to address the short-comings of their methods by physically checking the patients’ records.  Here is a brief summary.

TL;DR: Of 579 GBS patients receiving Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine 48 needed follow up care and only 1 was hospitalized. That 1 was released after plasmapheresis.

Results
Seven hundred two cases of GBS were identified between 2000 and 2020. Three hundred thirty-seven (48%) were women and the mean (SD) age was 53 (18) years. Of these patients, 579 had received 1 vaccine dose and 539 received 2 doses. A median (IQR) of 108 (82 to 122) days’ follow-up was obtained after the first vaccine administration and 90 (64 to 100) after the second. Of 40 patients who received only 1 dose of vaccine, 38 had COVID-19 previously and needed only 1 dose according to Israeli Ministry of Health guidelines.1

Forty-eight of 579 patients were seen in a hospital (Table). Twenty-four had visited the emergency department and were released after less than 24 hours for transient non-neurologic concerns and the others needed admission for a variety of conditions. Only 5 were referred to the hospital for neurological concerns. Two patients had paresthesia, 1 patient had several months' duration of tremor, and 1 patient was evaluated for a seizure. They were released from the emergency department within a few hours without further medical observation. The fifth patient had a history of previously diagnosed GBS and was treated with plasmapheresis with no residual neurological symptoms. The patient had progressive leg weakness and paresthesia that started shortly after receiving the first vaccine dose, which lasted for several weeks. Several days following administration of the second vaccine dose, the patient was admitted to the hospital. The clinical picture and electrodiagnostic evidence were suggestive of sensorimotor demyelinating polyneuropathy. The patient was treated with plasmapheresis in the hospital and, by the day of discharge, had a significant improvement in her lower limb weakness and only minor proximal weakness without any sensory disturbance.",,,,1631368391,{},hcfo3tw,True,t3_pm7dnh,False,False,t1_hcflh75,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pm7dnh/rate_of_recurrent_guillainbarré_syndrome_after/hcfo3tw/,1631460921.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

But those of us in developed countries are inundated with videos of disaster from all around the globe, be it famine, tsunamis, war, and disease. There’s always a cause to give to, people to help. And at the same time, there develops a sense that those things are going on far away.

When you rip away people’s long developed sense of specialness, a lot of them will go into deep denial and even lash out. It takes time and energy to tease them out of it. A part of me goes “fuck them, let them all die”, but that’s not really what’s going to happen. Instead, most of them will survive, our hospitals get overwhelmed, we create a generation of broken and deeply scarred health care workers who in a few decades will probably be living on the streets much like veterans from past wars, and the bulk of those who lasted through the crisis riding their wave of denial will be even more entrenched in their beliefs, willing to vote for people who support their false narrative.

So, I think it behooves all of us to work to set the record straight, to convince those we can, to try to make things better. It’s frustrating as hell, but if I can convince even a small handful of people to get vaxxed, maybe that’s one less patient an icu team has to deal with, and maybe that’ll save the life of an innocent patient that got a stroke at the wrong time, a child whose parents refused to let them get vaxxed, or a bit of sanity for a struggling nurse or doctor.

Two, yes, as a fellow J&amp;J recipient the lack of info about real world efficacy, boosters, etc is extremely frustrating. However the limited data that has come out has been reassuring. I do wish more of it was third party analysis and not just J&amp;Js own work though.

To be more specific, [J&amp;J induced antibodies seem to stick around for at least 6-9 months](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.25.21262569v1), and [retains antibody activity against Delta, including an 85% efficacy against severe/critical disease](https://www.jnj.com/positive-new-data-for-johnson-johnson-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-on-activity-against-delta-variant-and-long-lasting-durability-of-response).

From my point of view the lack of publicly available follow-up info about J&amp;J is terrible, and the sooner we get some actual clear guidance about boosters the better, but it's still a good vaccine that is doing well to prevent bad outcomes.

The reality is that there are very few drugs that are specifically studied in pregnant women to prove safety. In addition to the challenge of recruiting participants from a smaller population, there are also serious ethical concerns about running controlled trials among pregnant women.

Most drugs are not proved safe for pregnant women. Class b and c drugs describe those with no known ill effects for humans, meaning “among all the pregnant women who did need this drug, no adverse effects have been observed.” I felt no concern about taking a class b or c drug when there was a clear health benefit. These drugs include common drugs like amoxicillin.

The problem is people don’t understand that most of their choices will be about these class drugs. Most of the things they put in their bodies aren’t guaranteed safe for pregnant women. Absent evidence they’re harmful, doctors should be more clear that the compelling benefit of avoiding Covid far outweighs a teensy bit of uncertainty.

The main evidence for the vaccine being superior to naturally-acquired immunity is our experience with other viruses that have vaccines, especially other coronaviruses. Certainly all viruses are not the same, but it's pretty clear that immunity tends to work this way -- a vaccine, which comes in a predictable dosage, administered in a single, particular way -- tends to work better than simply catching the virus, which is not at all predictable or particular. Certainly there are some people who caught COVID and whose immune system responded in such a way as to make the vaccine unnecessary. But the predictability of the vaccine is what's important. Most people who catch COVID do not have serious symptoms or serious immune responses.

[],,Kmlevitt,,,[],,,,text,t2_j5swy,False,False,[],"My own summary of the takeaway points.

Moderna is trialing a vaccine booster shot called mRNA-1273.351 targeted toward the Beta South African variant, which contains the mutation E484K, which is able to avoid a lot of the antibodies produced by vaccines/natural immunity from the Wuhan strain.

Since they started developing this shot, the Delta variant outcompeted variants with that mutation, which might make these variants seem like old news. But just recently a version of Delta that includes the similar E484Q mutation was discovered. This could give the variant booster shot new relevance.

Here are some takeaways from this article:

&gt;All vaccines elicited strong neutralizing responses to the spike variants, though the mRNA-1273.351 produced a two-fold higher geometric mean titer (GMT) against the Beta [South African] variant, and four-fold lower against the D614G variant. The neutralizing activity against the Delta variant was reduced four- to five-fold for all the vaccines at the higher dose, and by ten-fold at the lower dose.

So: the booster is better against the Beta variant with the E484K mutation it is designed to target, but apparently no better against the ""D614G variant"" [sic?]. D614G is a mutation, not a variant, and actually the Beta variant holds this mutation too, so I'm not sure what they're talking about. But the Alpha is a variant that holds the D614G mutation, but (usually) not an E484 mutation, so perhaps that's what this could refer to.

&gt;Neutralizing activity was seen to be strong in all immunized mice at the higher dose, but lower with the mRNA-1273.351 against the D614G or D614G/N501Y strains [Alpha, compared to the unmodified vaccine. The converse was true of viruses with the E484K mutations. Both were equally active against the Delta strain, though the titers were lower as compared to that which was observed with the other variants.

So again, ""equally good"" against Delta (read: no better than the original vaccine against it), better against variants with the E484K mutation, but not as good against Alpha.

What I take away from this is that this is turning into a game of wack-a-mole. New variant-specific boosters could be useful against the very specific variant they were designed to target, but could perhaps be even less effective against other new variants relative to the original vaccine. That's discouraging. My hope was that the more variant-specific boosters our immune systems were exposed to, the better our bodies would get at tackling these variants as a general class of viruses.",,,,1631316900,{},hcdhrvs,True,t3_plvzmg,False,True,t3_plvzmg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/plvzmg/will_mrna_vaccine_boosters_be_required_for/hcdhrvs/,1631418200.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

2. You have businesses chomping at the bit trying to get back to ""normal"" and trying to kill off any work from home.  This is very out of sync with if the school closes who is able to watch the young kids.
3. Remote schooling for many districts was in complete infancy and left a bad taste in many mouths.  Teachers burned out even more,  kids lost out big time, parents became even more frustrated.
4. Some, possibly many, districts can't afford to have a large amount of kids enroll in a more experienced remote learning route.  If enough kids go to a cyber program, then you face possible furloughing of teachers.
5. At least in my area, the infrastructure is still not there,   The internet is just not fast enough for actual streaming and interaction, and many of the mobile networks are a joke. - the population wasn't dense enough to merit building or keeping up with good coverage.

I have been holding out because I saw that when the vaccines were becoming available to everyone, the vast majority of people I spoke with received some sort of compensation for getting them. My employer offered absolutely nothing, and neither did my local government, state government, or federal government. I figured if they want me to get it bad enough they'll pay me or literally force me. I don't want the vaccine, but I will do just about anything for money, up to getting vaccinated.

Of course there are people that wouldn't get it if you offered them $10,000, they genuinely are against them in every capacity. But I would bet they would convince a lot of people to get vaccinated *if* there was an incentive, and no, saying ""you won't get COVID"" or ""the shot is free"" is not very convincing. Mandate employers to give PTO for each injection, mandate employers to give PTO in the event one of their employees is has a nasty reaction to the shot, or cut out the middleman like I mentioned and give tax credits to people.

It will cost the government a lot less in the long run if they would just spend some money via direct payments for vaccinations or just be ok with collecting less revenue in the form of income taxes than it would by allowing the pandemic to continue.

I am sorry if my stance seems selfish, and to be honest it is. But I am low income, haven't had a single raise in almost two years (not even a COL adjustment), work shitty hours, and am not even offered any overtime despite me asking for it regularly.

With a large vaccinated population, especially one that's still increasing, you would also expect breakthrough infections to increase proportionally, albeit they would still be the minority of infections.

&gt; As COVID-19 cases continue to rise in Oregon and clog the medical system, state health officials say the rate of coronavirus in unvaccinated people is currently five times higher than in those who are vaccinated.

&gt; A report released by the Oregon Health Authority on Wednesday shows that more than 80% of COVID-19 cases last week were among unvaccinated people. Breakthrough cases — fully vaccinated people who test positive for the coronavirus — accounted for about 20% of last weeks cases.

&gt; Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 16,417 reported breakthrough cases identified in Oregon, which is about 6% of the state’s total amount of cases throughout the pandemic. About 5% of the state’s breakthrough cases have been hospitalized and less than 1% have died. The median age of those deaths is 80, officials said.

&gt; **Oregon is in the midst of its worst COVID-19 surge since the start of the pandemic** — which health officials say is fueled by unvaccinated people and the highly transmissible delta variant.

&gt; **Although the number of cases slightly decreased last week from the previous week, the health authority also reported the state’s ninth straight week of increasing COVID-19 hospitalizations**. As of Thursday, there were just 56 available adult intensive care unit beds available and hospital beds were at 93% capacity.

&gt; The latest projections from the Oregon Health &amp; Science University shows that while hospitalizations have peaked, the current COVID-19 surge is far from over. **The new forecast predicts that hospitals across the state will remain under severe strain for the next two to three months.**

&gt; In addition, the health officials have reported “sharp increases” in daily deaths associated with COVID-19. Last week there were 176 reported coronavirus-related deaths.

&gt; “This grim trend follows several weeks of record, or near record, daily cases and hospitalizations,” Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen said on Wednesday. **“Oregonians should be prepared to see this tragic toll escalate dramatically in coming days and weeks.”**

The latter would mean it's just a matter of time though before Canada experiences the surge in cases. Is the amount of time between doses enough to warrant predicting an entirely different outcome?

""***they*** just keep repeating the statements made by the authorities and calling people idiots for not believing them"" (here, ***they*** clearly does not refer to the authorities)

  
Let me clarify: I never said the authorities are calling them idiots. I'm referring to pro-vax people on social media/friends/family members, etc. If vax-hesitant people don't trust authorities for reasons XYZ, nothing the authorities say will matter until that trust is reestablished. This can only be done by pro-vax people who are not authorities, but instead of addressing the source of mistrust, they repeat what the authorities say and shut down any form of open discussion. 

Yes, the government has tried to inform people, but objectively, their messaging has been terrible. They have tried an approach (but definitely not the approach I'm suggesting) where you tell people what to believe and keep repeating these things but allow very little room for people to raise concerns/genuine questions. Sure, I get it; among those concerns there's a bunch of crap from conspiracy theorists, but don't you see the lost opportunities when you treat good-faith questions the same way you treat conspiracies?

Haven't seen Denmarks figures but here in Sweden the number of deaths among kids have been extremely low. I would think Denmark have similar statistics.

Checked the recent numbers and for Sweden 5 kids in the bracket 0-9 years old have died with Covid. 4 kids in the 10-19 years old group. The total number who have died with a positive Covid diagnosis in Sweden is 14703 so we are talking comparatively about a very tiny number. Drowning is a more common cause of death for kids than Covid for example.

Others may think differently but personally I don't see a reason to vaccinate kids with these statstics in mind. I guess the primary argument would be that it would lower transmission, protect other groups, but the science for that seems unclear (I'm all for vaccinating and protecting risk groups and the elderly so not against vaccines, just want to point that out).",,,,1631381282,{},hcggv5a,False,t3_pma0sv,False,False,t1_hcg7i3c,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pma0sv/denmark_ends_its_covid_restrictions_thanks_to_its/hcggv5a/,1631479504.0,27,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

What really sucked is the long term stuff. They put me on Benzonatate and Dexamethasone. The benzo’s aren’t that bad, it’s a sedative that numbs your lungs and keeps you from coughing out chunks of your alveoli. I have to take three a day and they mess your sleep cycle and mood swings. I’m on 4hrs of sleep and completely fine now, come around 5pm I’ll be falling asleep driving home and wanting to rid out the eyes of someone for not using their blinker. 

The Dexamethasone is a bitch though, it’s cancer medication to boost your immune system, but gives you blood clots (on top of the ones you already have) heartburn, which is Cary bc you don’t know if it’s a heart attack or just the medication, makes you hungry as shit, constipates you and messes with your bowels, nausea, joint paint. Shit makes a 20year old feel like I’m 80 with arthritis.

They also gave me some IV injected blood thinners on baggies. Not bad but the poking sucks, also means you can’t drink or eat too much that would raise your blood sugar. Makes you piss right away and you have to hold it for four hours while it drips.

Doing better, mainly just the blood clots (veins feel like needles, and feet fall asleep randomly.) that’s scary, the cough and running out of breath walking to the kitchen is just annoying. Sucks bc I’m only 22 going on 23.

""TL;DR: **Yes people in the phase 3 trial got pregnant after vaccination. There was no difference between the rates of pregnancy in the vaccine or placebo groups.** No one in the vaccine group had any trouble with their pregnancy over the course of the study. They also tested it on female rats and did not find any problems, either with fertility or pregnancy.

The Pfizer vaccine FDA report doesn't give a nice summary like this, but they do report 23 people became pregnant during the trial. They report 2 adverse events related to pregnancy, both in the placebo group.

Both companies say they will continue to monitor pregnant people. In general, there is no know reason why a vaccine would affect fertility. I don't believe any ever has before. While mRNA technology is new-ish, it's not so radically different that there would be any reason to believe fertility would be affected.

For the sake of argument, I will assume for now that vaccines are superior. The question I'm asking is, **how much better than natural immunity? And does that difference justify a vaccine mandate for those people?** This is important because vaccine mandates have consequences, so we need to balance the pros/cons.  


On a related note, people who have been fully vaccinated for 1-2 months will have better protection than those who were vaxxed 7-8 months ago. Should the latter be forced to get a booster right away? If not, how do you justify this? Do we know for sure that people with waning vax protection have better protection than those w/ natural immunity?  


(These are just some thoughts, not demanding you to give an answer, but if you have any related sources, I'd be happy to take a look.)  


Stepping back and looking at the bigger picture, what is a measurable goal or desired outcome of this mandate? Is it to achieve a fully vaxxed rate of X%? Depending on what X is, this mandate might not be the most effective method of achieving the goal. The key here is to stop treating unvaxxed people as a homogenous group. As I mentioned previously, there's a good portion of unvaxxed people who would get the shot given the opportunity to have some honest conversations, and if X is 70-80, it seems to me that establishing trust with the hesitant (not anti) population would be a safer move than sweeping mandates.   


It has always fascinated me why people turn to conspiracy theories, and the truth is, most (if not all) of them no longer trust the authorities. Unfortunately, many in the pro-vax camp don't realize this, and instead of trying to find out the reasons for mistrust (some of which is political and in this case, I see little hope; others, however, has much to do with poor messaging and incompetent communication) and addressing those, they just keep repeating the statements made by the authorities and calling people idiots for not believing them.",,,,1631367602,{},hcfmlg8,False,t3_pl59ch,False,True,t1_hcemt1n,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pl59ch/sweeping_new_vaccine_mandates_for_100_million/hcfmlg8/,1631459961.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

They estimate the rate of myocarditis after two shots of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to be 162.2 cases per million for healthy boys aged 12 to 15 and 94 cases per million for healthy boys aged 16 to 17. The equivalent rates for girls were 13.4 and 13 cases per million, respectively. At current US infection rates, the risk of a healthy adolescent being taken to hospital with Covid in the next 120 days is about 44 per million, they said.

For some people privileged enough to have maternity and paternity leave, in the US, yes. I'm not surprised if it's much more possible in the Netherlands because their social welfare system is significantly better than ours with regards to childbirth.

We were one of those people lucky enough to have leave but even I was back to work after two months and my partner was on her own. Before vaccinations, daycare felt unthinkable as well as asking our parents to fly cross country to help. 
 
&gt;My anecdotal evidence is that there was an uptick in births in the work from home set

Right, a specific type of privilege, but even for us wfh people we still need childcare to work, so that means being able to afford a nanny to bubble with or going with daycare and schools and all the risks that come with that. It's not what I would define as a ""super ideal time.""

[],,theview126,,,[],,,,text,t2_1smh41dg,False,False,[],"Since the vaccine came out on emergency authorization, I have been on the fence about getting the vaccine. I wanted to wait until it was finally approved, which has happened with the Pfizer vaccine. However, something has happened that has now made me question getting it. 

To start, I'm 31 years old, healthy, exercise very regularly, and have no underlying health problems (no disease or illness runs in my family either, I'm fortunate to say that most in my family live well past 85-90 years old). 

I'm not against vaccination. In fact, I have a 6 month old that just got his 3rd round of vaccines. I get tetanus boosters, TDAP, MMR vaccines, etc and do so because I know that I won't get what those vaccinations protect against. I don't get the flu shot because again, I'm healthy, and I don't like the idea of getting a vaccine that only has a chance of protecting you that season. 

Where I work, 5 individuals who are fully vaccinated (mixture of Moderna and Pfizer) were all exposed to COVID19 after two employees who are also fully vaccinated went out of town for a conference and were diagnosed with COVID. 

All 7 of them began showing symptoms and all 7 of them tested positive. We can roughly trace who was exposed when, and can conclude that the two employees over a few day period transmitted it to other vaccinated employees. 

So, my honest question (in which I would appreciate honest answers)...what's the point of getting the vaccine for me? I know there's the argument of ""well if you get it, your chances of going to the hospital from COVID are reduced"". But, my chances of going to the hospital from covid is very reduced already given my health status and age. And the argument of ""if you get it, you protect others"" seems null to me when several vaccinated people spread it to other vaccinated people at my work.

I still wear a mask, but I'm genuinely curious as to why I personally should get the vaccine.

[],,tozalo,,,[],,,,text,t2_uf2cwxn,False,False,[],"&gt;Abstract

&gt;The post-infection of COVID-19 includes a myriad of neurologic symptoms including neurodegeneration. Protein aggregation in brain can be considered as one of the important reasons behind the neurodegeneration. SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein receptor binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD) binds to heparin and heparin binding proteins. Moreover, heparin binding accelerates the aggregation of the pathological amyloid proteins present in the brain. In this paper, we have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binds to a number of aggregation-prone, heparin binding proteins including Aβ, α-synuclein, tau, prion, and TDP-43 RRM. These interactions suggests that the heparin-binding site on the S1 protein might assist the binding of amyloid proteins to the viral surface and thus could initiate aggregation of these proteins and finally leads to neurodegeneration in brain. The results will help us to prevent future outcomes of neurodegeneration by targeting this binding and aggregation process.


&gt;4. Conclusion

&gt;In summary, the findings reported here support the hypothesis that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can interact with heparin binding amyloid forming proteins. Our results indicate stable binding of the S1 protein to these aggregation-prone proteins which might initiates aggregation of brain protein and accelerate neurodegeneration. These findings might explain the possible neurological distresses associated with COVID-19. Therefore, targeting the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the brain proteins might be a suitable way to reduce the aggregation process and thus neurodegeneration in COVID-19 patients.",,,,1631339483,{},hcelsm8,False,t3_plwywg,False,True,t3_plwywg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/plwywg/sarscov2_spike_protein_interactions_with/hcelsm8/,1631439370.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

But I'm not sure how it'll work out. I suppose it'll be interesting to see.

The rule is going to have to have some sort of phase in time, and most companies are going to want to see what the requirements are before implementing so they don't need to go back and do it again. The lawsuits are probably already written, but you can't sue until OSHA publishes the rule.

If and/or when the injunction is in place, the rule will be held up for months while it works its way through the courts.

What Biden is hoping for is that the courts don't grant an injunction, which, since the requirements are effectively a one time effort, would mean it doesn't matter what happens in the courts later on. However (at least in my personal opinion) courts tend to favor the status quo when deciding if an injunction should be put into place. The ""normal"" position is that the federal government doesn't mandate vaccines so it isn't very likely that the various courts allow it to move forward.

If the requirement is stayed, nobody who has not already received the vaccine is likely to do so.",,,,1631311640,{},hcd6wyp,False,t3_plfygr,False,True,t1_hcbnlvg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/plfygr/daily_discussion_thread_september_10_2021/hcd6wyp/,1631412054.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,dalomi9,,,[],,,,text,t2_ggfq6,False,False,[],"It is widely accepted that overuse of antibiotics has already led to antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria.  The process of evaluating a virus or bacteria in a lab for how it might mutate to evade treatment is similar to the real world situation we know find ourselves in with partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated and unvaccinated people intermingling and spreading the virus, giving it ample opportunities to mutate immune escape mechanisms when exposed to antibodies in vaccinated people.  The question is, is the selective pressure high enough to elicit the mutation and propagation of a variant that would outcompete the extremely virulent Delta variant?  So far, the answer is no, Delta still outcompetes variants that have been shown to have more immune escape mutations, such as the Lambda variant.   

The most likely way some super variant could form is through immune compromised people that have been vaccinated, but don't have a strong enough immune system to utilize the vaccine induced antibodies to fight the virus off.  These people will likely have Long-COVID and their immune systems will either be losing the fight or in a stalemate with the virus, which will have ample time to evolve immune escape mechanisms.  The other hurdle is the virus would then have to jump into the general population from that individual.  There have likely already been thousands of variants that have evolved in a similar way that would have been a major issue if they jumped into the general population, but we will never know about them because they died in their host or with their host.",,,,1631315170,{},hcdealt,False,t3_plqkyt,False,False,t1_hcclyja,/r/Coronavirus/comments/plqkyt/vaccines_will_not_produce_worse_variants_science/hcdealt/,1631416188.0,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The EMA’s vaccines lead Marco Cavaleri told a press briefing on Thursday that the agency was expecting to receive data on 5-to-11s “at least for some of the vaccines, during the fall.”

That makes a mid-October date for the first jabs appear ambitious. Once the EMA has reached its decision, Germany's vaccine committee would also need to make a call on whether to extend the vaccination program to this age group.

&gt;Is anyone else with the J&amp;J shot absolutely frustrated and increasingly worried about the rising case of COVID-Delta cases even amongst vaccinated peers?

I did not get the J&amp;J shot, but I am sympathetic. Here's a quote from expert Michael Osterholm, from [the Osterholm update, episode 65](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/podcasts-webinars/episode-65)

&gt;Finally, for those of you who are J&amp;J recipients, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I think it's really unfortunate we don't have more data in this country to support whether or not you need a booster dose. And I think at this point it's likely you will. It's just a challenge of getting the information so that it can be done based on some science as opposed to just somebody like me saying, I think so. So stay tuned. There's more to come. Nothing urgently needed out of anyone right now. And I think that's the important message.

Essentially the Janssen (J&amp;J) vaccine was approved later, and given to a smaller portion of the population. So we don't have as much data on it as the other shots. And the margins of error in the real-world studies of efficiency are bigger than for the other shots as a result.

&gt;Furthermore, there's barely any news coverage or press regarding the existence of booster shots.

This is what terrified me, to the point I couldn't sleep that night: A 2 week incubation period and asymptomatic infections.

That means this is out and about for days maybe weeks before people get sick, if they ever get sick, spreading it around.

We had our panic moment weeks ahead of most Americans. When they finally shut down NYC, I had been working from home for a couple weeks because I asked my boss citing the virus to my boss. We had already stocked our pantry and bought a deep freezer that went in our living room at that point.

When the lockdown happened, a few weeks later, there was a palpable reaction from all of my neighbors (we live in an apartment building). It was around 6 o'clock and we were getting some packages downstairs and everyone coming home from the city were on edge and obviously freaked out. One lady came rushing into the elevator we were on, she was wide eyed, sweaty and panicking. Nope. I got off the elevator. She looked at me oddly as the doors closed. I have NO idea what her deal was but nothing good ever comes from hanging around people in that state. Besides, maybe she had a fever?

One of the valuable lessons I learned from 9/11 is that unless you've experienced a real threat or emergency in your life, you are far less likely to trust your instincts and take action immediately. People don't want to cause a scene, or they're worried that people will think they're weird they stand around for a few moments, trying to decide what to do. I don't have that problem anymore.

Israel has a lot of people under the eligible age to get vaccinated- 78% of those who are eligible have been fully vaccinated, but it’s only 58% of their total population. They were doing well and reopened before the Delta variant reached them so it spread quickly. Vaccinations have helped people who do catch covid have a milder case. Those who are seriously ill after vaccination are mostly over 60 years old and have underlying health conditions. Vaccinations help. Even if you do get covid after, you’re less likely to be hospitalized and even less likely to die. 

Look at the rates of those being hospitalized and dying in the USA right now- it’s unvaccinated people, by a huge margin; they’re more likely to catch it, 10 times more likely to be hospitalized, and 11 to 15 times more likely to die. 

Vaccinated people help to stop and slow the spread. Slowing and stopping the spread means our hospitals don’t get overwhelmed and people don’t die waiting for ICU beds for unrelated and treatable illnesses. You and everyone else spreading these little ‘why should I when’ arguments are helping to continue this pandemic.

&gt;Lewis County General Hospital, in Lowville, will temporarily stop delivering babies after Sept. 24, WWNY reported. During a news conference Friday afternoon, Lewis County Health System CEO Gerald Cayer said seven of the 30 hospital workers who resigned were from the hospital’s maternity ward. He added that another seven maternity unit staffers were undecided about getting the vaccine, the television station reported.

&gt;The workers were objecting to a Sept. 27 deadline to receive a first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, the Watertown Daily Times reported. Then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued the state mandate on Aug. 23.

&gt;Twenty of the staff members who resigned worked in clinical positions like nurses, therapists and technicians, the newspaper reported.

&gt;“If we can pause the service and now focus on recruiting nurses who are vaccinated, we will be able to reengage in delivering babies here in Lewis County,” Cayer told reporters.

&gt;Cayer said 165 hospital employees, or 27% of the facility’s workforce, have yet to be vaccinated against COVID-19, WWNY reported. There have been 464 workers who have received the vaccine, Cayer said.

&gt;“Our hope is as we get closer (to the deadline), the numbers will increase of individuals who are vaccinated, fewer individuals will leave and maybe, with a little luck, some of those who have resigned will reconsider,” Cayer told reporters. “We are not alone. There are thousands of positions that are open north of the Thruway and now we have a challenge to work through, you know, with the vaccination mandate.”

&gt;Cayer stressed that the hospital will not be “shutting down services,” the Daily Times reported.

&gt;“It just is a crazy time,” Cayer told the newspaper. “It’s not just LCHS-centric.

Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum anti-parasitic drug used commonly in the treatment of strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis [81]. It acts by inhibiting nuclear transport activity.

In-vivo studies for the use of ivermectin as an antiviral are scarce. In a clinical trial for the use of ivermectin in dengue, it reduced levels of NS1 antigen but had no impact on viral load and clinical outcomes [83].

This is going to be yet another case of underestimating the virus, despite knowing our own past history of underestimating the virus. I'll quote Dr. William Haseltine, from his August 11th Article:

[Busting 12 Covid-19 Myths That Could Kill](https://archive.is/Uts6N)

([Outline.com version if the previous archive.is link doesn't work](https://outline.com/ark597))

&gt;We have underestimated the force that is SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on global society since the beginning. Our miscalculation of everything from how the virus spreads to how much it can adapt and change has led to the loss of millions of lives worldwide, with infections and deaths still on the rise to this day. You think we would have learned our lesson by now—and yet in the face of increasingly dangerous variants, a rhetoric of relentless optimism undergirded by complacency and inaction continues to cloud our better judgment.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last year, neither the first appearance of the virus in Wuhan in late 2019 nor the dire situation that capsized Italy in March and April 2020 constituted a wake up call. Only after the first waves of Covid-19 cases hit Europe and the United States hard did either population begin to take the pandemic more seriously. This year, once again, the catastrophic outbreaks that slammed through India this past spring didn’t seem to be a sufficient warning that worse was to come. Instead many countries, the US among them, began to systematically dismantle the web of protective measures they spent the better part of last year building. Until now.

We'll have the tools to drastically reduce transmission, rather than resign ourselves to live with Covid forever, when next generation anti-Covid weapons arrive:

* Covid anti-viral drugs, to which the Biden administration has already committed over 3 billion dollars.
* Pancoronavirus vaccines, designed to produce broadly neutralizing antibodies and thus be resilient in the face of new variants  [New Hope For A Covid-19 Vaccine That Protects Against All Variants](https://outline.com/7XNn6R)

&gt;... there is now evidence that a vaccine capable of immunizing against coronaviruses more broadly—not just SARS-CoV-2 and its new variants—could be on the horizon. Were this pancoronavirus vaccine to come to fruition, revising existing Covid-19 vaccines year in and year out wouldn’t be necessary.

* intranasal vaccines, targeting the nasal mucosa where the infection actually begins, which aim to provide sterilizing immunity. [Intranasal COVID-19 Vaccine Reduces Disease Severity and Blocks Transmission](https://www.technologynetworks.com/biopharma/news/intranasal-covid-19-vaccine-reduces-disease-severity-and-blocks-transmission-351955)

&gt;""If we can train the cells that line our respiratory system against the virus, they will be better equipped to tackle the virus before it starts its infection,"" Munir explained. **The intranasal vaccine essentially ""nips SARS-CoV-2 in the bud"": the virus is cleared before infection is established, therefore reducing transmission of the virus to others.**",,,,1631314507,{},hcdcxtn,False,t3_plqxde,False,False,t1_hccnkig,/r/Coronavirus/comments/plqxde/massachusetts_coronavirus_breakthrough_cases_jump/hcdcxtn/,1631415432.0,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The solution is to drive infection numbers way down to reduce the opportunities for mutation.

Vaccines are non-neutralizing -- you can still get infected post-vaccination and these infections still produce massive quantities of virus, each with a chance of mutation.  With vaccines the outcome is much, much better for the vaccinated person.
