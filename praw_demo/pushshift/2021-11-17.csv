You pointed out it started in China. Much harder to contain something where it starts no? That's where preventative measures and fast acting would have saved the day... 

Yeah it's great we have our freedom. Yet, our freedom killed tons of loved ones and disabled many others. A year and half to get a vaccine would not have been much to ask in the grand scheme of things. Everyone pretends the way we went about it saved our economy... However, if we controlled it we could have been supporting all our business like our restrauants much more. Instead we had to shut them down, then bring them back online, then shut them down, then give them subsides... Plus, all the people that got sick cost tons of money and will for the foreseeable future. I am 25 and was working for the government full time in a highly educated position. Now I'm disabled and unable to work with the government paying for me to live. My medicine costs minimum $100,000 a year. This will be the rest of my life. There are many people like me that survived and now it will cost the nation the rest of our lives. That's minimum $6,000,000 just for me... And I hate it. Now, think of all the other people like me. 

We wouldn't even have to worry about imprisonment if people just made small sacrifices to help others like wearing their face mask...

tbh it doesn't make much difference to the issue at hand. Humans have a very strong, very primal aversion to the idea of anything pricking them and injecting something into their body (whether it's into the bloodstream, the muscle, or just under the skin). There's probably hundreds of millions of years of evolution behind it, since the only things that do that in nature are venomous animals and parasites.

Cultural depictions of injections also tend to be extremely negative.

It's probably very easy to exploit that unconscious anxiety and turn it into a conscious fear. Conspiracy theories generally tend to boil down to giving people an explanation for why they feel uneasy or attacked.

Policies are the vector sum of all involved interests... that's a fine way to run the everyday business of a country, when everything is going nicely and all that's left to do is fine-tuning. In an emergency situation, it's a recipe for disaster. Not only did our entire political caste lack the courage to do something decisive, they also lacked the intellectual capacity to spot that a change in MO was desperately called for. To everybody's shock, actual leadership was needed, not the moderation of a crap ton of diverging interests combined with strategical maneuvering and power mongering, as was the style of Merkel that succeeded to keep her in office for so long it changed perceptions about what actually is the job of a politician. 

Instead, and that made matters worse by a lot, we ended up with the Bundestag castrating itself willingly for fear of being put in a situation where balls absolutely would be required, and decision and policy-making in the hands of the Ministerpr√§sidentenkonferenz, a political entity where not being able to get over the need for political posturing is baked into the very structure - there's always some election going on somewhere, so there's always the need for some dimwit to be seen to 'stand up for his constituency' slowing down proceedings to a crawl. Alright, in less polemic words, that's probably intended as a safeguard against rash decisions, but that doesn't make it in any way less obvious how ridiculously unfit for purpose the whole setup is for the task at hand. 

As for the FDP, they never were anything but the party of the most shortsighted business interests, sugarcoated with a thin veneer of civil liberties, heavily focussing on the more meaningless ones. What those civil liberties are and entail has long become a casualty in the ongoing culture wars instigated by the right, though, and by and large has turned toxic. Apparently your freedom these days depends on your ability to get away with reckless self-harm as a stopgap for failing emotional self-regulation and wanton irresponsibility for the safety of others sprinkled on top. That's not civil liberties, that's being a psychopath. Interestingly enough, if you were to take the concept of the homo oeconomicus that's at the heart of economical thinking and diagnose that construct with the criteria presented in relevant clinical manuals, psychopath is basically what you get. So, all in all, not that hard to see why this approach came natural to the FDP. Obviously, though, when it comes to providing leadership - in other words, actually doing the job of a politician in a crisis - they're entirely the wrong fit.

I have to say though that as a cyclist, a former rower and before that long distance runner there is however something special about long endurance sessions. Have never gotten as powerful an effect on my mental well being from doing strength training.

When you exhaust yourself for several hours via cardio you can reach some other part of your psyche. The mental and physical battle that takes place is something else. A 3 hour hard cycling session for example just challenges you in a completely different way than trying to get through some sets lifting does.

&gt;That represents a faster uptake than when adults were initially offered coronavirus vaccine shots about a year ago, he added. ‚ÄúFor perspective, it took about 50 days for us to reach 10 percent of adults with one shot,‚Äù he said.

&gt;There are at least eight times as many adults as there are kids in the 5-11 age group, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

&gt;Zients, speaking to reporters alongside the nation‚Äôs top infectious-disease expert, Anthony S. Fauci, and CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, said that since injections began this month for kids younger than 12, about 2.6 million of them had received their first shot.

&gt;‚ÄúIn fact, the pace of vaccinations for kids has been accelerating. In the last week, 1.7 million kids got vaccinated ‚Äî double the prior week,‚Äù Zients said.

&gt;Zients also said that about 80 percent of Americans age 12 or older had received at least one shot of a coronavirus vaccine and 31 million people had been injected with boosters. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more work to do, but these milestones represent critical progress,‚Äù he said.

&gt;The positive developments that the White House sought to highlight coincided with grimmer news. New cases, hospitalizations and deaths were increasing in some colder states, though the nation as a whole was seeing covid-19 fatalities decline, Washington Post figures show. More than 763,000 Americans have died of covid-19 since the start of the pandemic.

&gt;And although more Americans have been getting vaccinated, logistical problems have frustrated parents trying to immunize their kids (in one New York City vaccination site, for instance, parents reportedly waited six hours to get their children vaccine jabs), while confusion over who qualifies for boosters has disrupted administrations of the extra shots in some states.


&gt;Zients didn‚Äôt directly address specific problems. But he told reporters that vaccine shots for young children are now available at 30,000 locations, up from 20,000 the prior week.

&gt;That more kids are getting vaccinated is good news, medical experts say, especially ahead of the holiday season. ‚ÄúIn addition to the benefit to the children themselves, their immunity will decrease community spread and help keep adults around them safer,‚Äù said Robert Wachter, the University of California at San Francisco‚Äôs medicine department chair.

&gt;‚ÄúImagine a holiday gathering with older people and their grandchildren ‚Äî if the kids are vaccinated, the chances that one of them will infect their elderly relative, sometimes with devastating effects, goes down significantly,‚Äù he said in an email.

&gt;Small family get-togethers whose participants are all vaccinated are generally safe, according to Iahn Gonsenhauser, a professor of internal medicine at Ohio State University‚Äôs college of medicine.

&gt;‚ÄúUnvaccinated individuals really pose the greatest threat, and that‚Äôs when it becomes necessary to put some rules and precautions in place, even though those conversations can be a little bit awkward,‚Äù he said.

&gt;Despite starting its rollout weeks, or even months, ahead of other wealthy nations, the United States has fallen behind on vaccinations.

[],,lyx_plin,,,[],,,,text,t2_aomp5sy5,False,False,[],"**Why did Japan‚Äôs fifth and biggest wave of the coronavirus pandemic, driven by the supercontagious delta variant, suddenly come to an abrupt end following a seemingly relentless rise in new infections? And what made Japan different from other developed countries that are now seeing a fresh surge in new cases?**  
According to one group of researchers, the surprising answer may be that the delta variant took care of itself in an act of ‚Äúself-extinction.‚Äù  
Three months after the delta variant spurred record daily nationwide caseloads of nearly 26,000, new COVID-19 infections in Japan have plummeted, dropping below 200 in recent weeks. Highlighting that drop was the fact that no deaths were reported on Nov. 7 ‚Äî the first time that had happened in about 15 months.  
Many scholars point to a variety of possibilities, which include one of the highest vaccination rates among advanced countries with 75.7% of residents fully vaccinated as of Wednesday. Other potential factors are the social distancing and mask-wearing measures that are now deeply embedded in Japanese society.  
But the chief reason may be related to the genetic changes that the coronavirus undergoes during reproduction, at a pace of around two mutations per month. According to a potentially revolutionary theory proposed by Ituro Inoue, a professor at the National Institute of Genetics, the delta variant in Japan accumulated too many mutations to the virus‚Äôs error-correcting, non-structural protein called nsp14. As a result, the virus struggled to repair the errors in time, ultimately leading to ‚Äúself-destruction.‚Äù  
Studies have shown that more people in Asia have a defense enzyme called APOBEC3A that attacks RNA viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, when compared to people in Europe and Africa.  
So the researchers from the National Institute of Genetics and Niigata University set out to discover how the APOBEC3A protein affects the nsp14 protein and whether it can inhibit the activity of the coronavirus. The team conducted an analysis of the genetic diversity data for the alpha and delta variants from infected clinical specimens in Japan from June to October.  
They then visualized the relationships among the DNA sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to show genetic diversity in a diagram called a haplotype network. In general, the bigger the network is, the more positive cases it represents  
The network of the alpha variant, which was the main driver for Japan‚Äôs fourth wave from March to June, had five major groups with many mutations branching out, confirming a high level of genetic diversity. The researchers thought the delta variant, which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says is more than twice as contagious as previous variants and might cause more severe illness in unvaccinated people, would have a far more vibrant genetic diversity.  
Surprisingly, they found the opposite to be true. The haplotype network had only two major groups and the mutations seemed to come to a sudden stop in the middle of its evolutionary development process. When the researchers went on to examine the virus‚Äôs error-correcting enzyme nsp14, they discovered that the vast majority of nsp14 specimens in Japan seemed to have undergone many genetic changes in mutation sites called A394V.  
‚ÄúWe were literally shocked to see the findings,‚Äù Inoue told The Japan Times. ‚ÄúThe delta variant in Japan was highly transmissible and keeping other variants out. But as the mutations piled up, we believe it eventually became a faulty virus and it was unable to make copies of itself. Considering that the cases haven‚Äôt been increasing, we think that at some point during such mutations it headed straight toward its natural extinction.‚Äù  
Inoue‚Äôs theory, while innovative, would lend support to the mysterious disappearance of the delta variant‚Äôs spread in Japan. While much of the rest of the world with similarly high vaccination rates, including South Korea and some Western countries, are suffering from record waves of new infections, Japan appears to be a peculiar case in that COVID-19 cases have remained subdued despite trains and restaurants filling up following the end of the most recent state of emergency.  
‚ÄúIf the virus were alive and well, cases for sure would increase as masking and vaccination do not prevent breakthrough infections in some cases,‚Äù Inoue said.  
Indeed, the unexpected plunge in new cases following the summer wave has been a hot topic of discussion among many experts, including those not conducting studies on the coronavirus, according to Takeshi Urano, a professor at Shimane University‚Äôs Faculty of Medicine who was not involved in the research led by Inoue.  
‚ÄúNsp14 works with other virus proteins and has a critical function to protect the virus RNA from breaking apart,‚Äù he said when asked about Inoue‚Äôs findings. ‚ÄúStudies have shown that a virus with a crippled nsp14 has a significantly reduced ability to replicate, so this can be one factor behind the rapid decline in new cases. The nsp14 is virus-derived, and the chemical agent to curb this protein could become a promising medicine, with development already underway.‚Äù  
Japan seems to be an anomaly in that the delta variant was virtually shutting out alpha and other variants by late August. On the other hand, other countries ‚Äî including India and Indonesia, both of which were hit particularly hard by the delta variant ‚Äî have reported a mix of alpha and delta strains among cases.  
A similar natural extinction of the coronavirus could possibly be observed overseas, Inoue says, adding that detecting that would be difficult as no other country seems to have accumulated as many mutations in the virus‚Äôs nsp14 as in Japan, though similar mutations at the A394V site have been discovered in at least 24 countries.  
But Inoue‚Äôs theory may also help explain why the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) ended abruptly in 2003. An in vitro experiment in which the researchers caused mutations in nsp14 in the virus that causes SARS led to findings that the virus eventually could not replicate itself as mutations piled up.  
‚ÄúNo genome data exists, so it‚Äôs just a hypothesis, but because it has disappeared, it will never see the light of day again,‚Äù he said.  
So what are the chances that we could see a similar natural extinction overseas of the COVID-19-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus?  
‚ÄúThe chances are not zero, but that seems too optimistic for now as we‚Äôre unable to get hold of any such evidence, though we have looked at various data of other countries,‚Äù he said.  
Since peaking in mid-August, daily COVID-19 cases in Japan continued a downward slide to fall below 5,000 by mid-September and under 200 by late October. The country has been enjoying one of the lowest infection rates of any advanced country for some time, but it‚Äôs not immune to the next wave of the pandemic, Inoue says.  
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs clearly a threat,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have been all right because there was a delta variant. Other variants sneaked in little by little but Japan‚Äôs delta was keeping them away. But because there‚Äôs nothing now to keep them at bay, there‚Äôs room for new ones to enter as the vaccines alone would not solve the problem. In that sense, I think the quarantine measures for immigration control are very important because we never know what comes in from foreign countries.‚Äù  
Some people may wonder if the self-extinction of the delta variant in Japan was caused by something special in the genetic make-up of Japanese people, but Inoue disagrees.  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPeople in East Asia, such as Koreans, are ethnically the same as Japanese. But I don‚Äôt know why this observation was made in Japan.‚Äù

Any evidence of waning of immunity against seriously disease seems to be confined to the elderly and long term care facilities.

There's some evidence that boosters also additionally reduce hospitalizations over 2-shots in people over-40, but they don't claim to see any waning there, they just claim that its even better.

Then they speculate that it'd be good for younger people to get boosted since it will probably be more protective but concede its difficult to see those in the numbers.

And at about that time, 73.3% of the states population had at least one dose. 

Fast forward to five months later in November an only 72.2% have received their second dose. 

So I am guessing a contributing factor is folks not getting both doses and being only partially protected. 

It's interesting how that data lines up with the increase of cases, which started around mid-July. 

The majority of the vaccines in the state we all administered (65% of the population) got their first dose by May 15, which was 6 months ago meaning the vaccine has been waning in efficacy for the majority of the vaccinated population. 

My assumption is, end of June when they lifted restrictions for the vaccinated opened itself up to more risk taking. The vaccinated assumed they were mostly safe, and the unvaccinated didn't care before then but now are not watched as closely with nervousness. 

Now most folks are still wearing masks when you are out and about in public, but I think an overall trend was that after over a year of not seeing friends and family, people started taking smaller more calculated risks by meeting indoors with larger groups of friends and family. Causing more spread. 

And contributing to that, it could have been that Delta raged in the unvaccinated groups most the past months, circulating in a vaccinated community, and now as those unvaccinated cases are beginning to slow down, at the same time most vaccines are wearing off, that variant is likely to be circulating in the vaccinated groups and causing more breakthroughs.

&gt;In interviews with WNYC/Gothamist, independent engineers warned of relying too heavily on the Intellipure purifiers and open windows, which city officials countered were adequate in reducing the risk of COVID-19 spread.

&gt;To learn why Intellipure air purifiers were selected for classrooms, WNYC/Gothamist has discovered that New York City‚Äôs Department of Education (DOE) got those devices for a bargain, according to contracts obtained via Freedom of Information requests.

Current hospitalizations per 100k unvaccinated: **44.7**

Current hospitalizations per 100k vaccinated: **4.5.**

When Fauci says there‚Äôs been an uptick in vaccinated hospitalizations, he‚Äôs right‚Äîcompared to how exceptionally well they were initially working.

My bet would be that it spilled over from bats to humans in rural china as part of bat guano collection out of caves for fertilizer.  Then it infected farmhands and initially spread poorly in humans (and quite poorly in less densely packed humans) but spilled over into racoon dogs (or another intermediate animal) which formed a reservoir for the virus.  Then it spilled backwards and forwards and was physically transported via racoon dogs into the dense population of humans in Wuhan where the market formed the first real superspreading event and took root in humans.

There was probably the initial mutation and acquisition (probably) of a furin cleavage site in bats which allowed it to infect humans, then a variant which acquired the ability to superspread in humans happened shortly before the market event (then came D614G, then Delta dramatically improved the FCS later, etc).  The farmed animals probably weren't the source but were a bioreservoir that kept it going until it got better at infecting humans, and found a tightly packed population center.

That makes humans the intermediate animal between bats and racoon dogs and since humans are a pervasive species with a wide range across China it easily explains how bats in Yunnan and racoon dogs could be connected.  And it explains the similar transport of SARS-CoV-1 from bats in Yunnan to racoon dogs in Guangdong.",,,,1637265159,{},hl5t5tt,False,t3_qwxahc,False,False,t3_qwxahc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qwxahc/dissecting_the_early_covid19_cases_in_wuhan/hl5t5tt/,1637601859.0,5,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚ÄúMost healthcare workers I know have increasingly significant compassion fatigue. 

They may have been so optimistic and empathetic and have strong desires to help others,  but now feel largely cynical and abused by the very patients and  families they are trying to help. It‚Äôs really sad and terrifying. I think this author is correct. I never thought about doing anything else but medicine‚Äî until now. 

It is hard not to be emotional about something you‚Äôve been so incredibly passionate about for much of your life when you realize most people don‚Äôt give a damn anymore.

I've been extremely supportive of the restrictions from the get go, and got double vaxxed as soon as I could. I'm just a dummy who is trying to understand the logic of some of the restrictions in my region (Nova Scotia, Canada).  
  
My region requires proof of vaccination and wearing a mask in public places. We also have a vaccination rate of nearly 80%. If you are at a restaurant or a sporting event, you may remove your mask when seated, ONLY if eating and drinking. There are also no gathering limits, or social distancing requirements. So, if everyone at a large event or restaurant MUST be vaccinated, why are masks necessary? what is the logic behind being allowed to take your mask off while eating or drinking (even at a sporting event, sitting amongst hundreds), but you must wear it if not? What is the end game or goal here?

The stats bear this out.  In trials, the population with boosters had 90% fewer hospitalizations, severe illnesses, and deaths than the population with two shots.

First and foremost, the vaccines work. This is fact. End of story. We know antibodies will wane over time and a reduction of IgA in the mucous membranes likely allows the highly infectious Delta variant to gain a temporary foothold in many individuals. No, it's not ideal but it's not unexpected. BUT T CELL MEDIATED IMMUNITY IS STILL THERE. Also, more evidence continues to come out showing that vaccinated individuals are likely less likely to pass on Covid because the detected Covid may be inactivated but still detectable due to the nature of the tests.

Second, you don't know that you actually had Covid. Even if you did, you can't be sure that your body properly developed a long term effective immune response. The spike protein targeted by the vaccines was chosen due to its stability through variants and its predictability.

I personally find your choice irresponsible and immature. Get the damn vaccine. Alas, I'm just a random screaming into the internet, because almost certainly, I won't change your mind....

Japan has done practically none of what China did, and they're down to an extremely low number of cases a day from a worst-ever surge that was pretty low by global standards.

Of course, my view is that policy can't account for this and there must be a reason why the virus is easier to control in that region -- maybe COVID is related to a virus that spread more in some places than in others, or something like that. But if Japan can mostly control COVID then it's not strange to think that China can control it even more with some extra-tough policies. It doesn't have much of a lesson for other regions, of course, until we figure out how to do what Japan did (I don't think we can, but at least they're a more plausible comparison than China or New Zealand).

Of course the downside of zero COVID is that it only works until you stop, and once it became clear that COVID wasn't going to burn out like the original SARS, everyone has had to reckon with the fact that they will have to accept a COVID wave (or several) at some point. This sort of incentivizes China's government to keep it up for as long as they can; maybe the vaccines and treatments will improve to the point that they don't have to accept that wave.

Until now: In a fire speech, Lothar Wieler describes how alarming the Corona situation is in Germany - and how great his frustration with politics is. [...]

&gt; Most recently, 0.8 percent of the sick died. This means that of the more than 50,000 people infected each day, 400 would die in the next few weeks. ""There is nothing more to be done about that."" At the federal press conference, he recently spoke more cautiously of 200 deaths per day, but the number is actually higher. Nobody can help these people, not even with the best medical care. [...]

&gt; The number of seriously ill Covid patients is increasing, and people with a stroke and other seriously ill people have to search for a free intensive care bed for up to two hours in some places. ""The supply is already no longer in accordance with best medical practices **in all federal states.**"" And that will increase. ""As you can see, the prognoses are super gloomy. They are really gloomy,"" said Wieler. ""There is an emergency in our country. If you don't see it, you're making a very big mistake."" [...]

&gt; Wieler accused politics of serious errors and omissions. ""We opened too quickly in too many areas,"" he criticized. ""Clubs and bars are hotspots, from my point of view they have to be closed."" Major events would have to be canceled. There are far too many contacts in the population, and one already knows from the first corona wave that contact restrictions are effective.

&gt; At the same time, Wieler pleaded for the consistent implementation of 2G rules, i.e. access to many areas only for vaccinated and convalescent people. ""We really shouldn't give those who don't get vaccinated the chance to bypass the vaccination, for example by getting tested,"" he said. 

&gt; In order to increase the vaccination rate, vaccination should also be carried out in pharmacies. ""I'm going to say that now very clearly: It must now be the end of the story that someone does not allow any other professional groups to vaccinate due to any circumstances. We are in an emergency,"" emphasized Wieler. ""Every man and mouse who can vaccinate should kindly vaccinate now. Otherwise we won't get this crisis under control.""

&gt; Wieler called on politics to finally act. ""We don't have to keep inventing something new. All of these concepts and recipes are in place,"" he said. ""That is clear language, but after 21 months I simply can no longer bear the fact that it may not be recognized what I say, among other things, and many other colleagues."" https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/wieler-rki-coronavirus-lage-101.html",,,,1637230838,{},hl3s875,False,t3_qwllkr,False,False,t3_qwllkr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qwllkr/germany_shatters_another_record_for_case_numbers/hl3s875/,1637561964.0,16,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With Pennsylvania, it straddles the Northeast/Midwest divide with the Philly half being fair to call northeast and the Pittsburgh half being fair to call Midwest, with the in-between being not quite a fit for either.

If you want to exclude PA from the list, that's a fair concession. But I did also include two Pacific-coast adjacent states in AZ+NV intentionally.

This is a huge difference not in favor of Taiwan. Disease spread through air borne particulate is dependant upon proximity. Who is closer together? The Tawainese are. This was obvious in the US where the cities were hit hardest first even though the R (infectivity per person) value was much lower for covid in the beginning compared to now.

This is a cultural difference between us and many Asian countries. They look at outcomes as a whole not how will this effect only me.

Yes, the United States couldn't do as well as Taiwan could have due to WAY larger population. This big of a difference does start to make a difference. However, the US could have done significantly better and failed. China has way bigger populous than US though and managed way better. 

The pandemic taskforce that was removed by Trump was meant to identify a disease three months in advance. Taiwan was highly successful because it identified the problem early and implemented strategies to effectively deal with it. The same with new Zealand. 

It would have been very feasible if the US identified it early to cut off all boarders, stop travel, implement a couple week hard quarantine through the whole country. Our national guard and military could have been used to deliver food during this time. Then we could have retained this hard border lockdown with no entry. Then country could have opened back up more inside. This would have inevitably been better for the economy than what we did. This is exactly what New Zealand did. It wouldn't have been perfect but way better.

If you extrapolate the death rate in Taiwan or new Zealand per population and apply it to the US population the death total is tiny compared to what we currently have. Even if you multiple those numbers by a value of ten it's still a fraction of the death we saw...",,,,1637200195,{},hl2emk7,False,t3_qwah10,False,False,t1_hl279se,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qwah10/zero_covid_is_getting_harderbut_china_is_sticking/hl2emk7/,1637534471.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The message was not ""don't wear masks"". It was ""don't wear masks unless you're sick"". The people (excluding healthcare workers etc who needed to be protected in their line of duty) who wanted to wear masks were largely selfish; they wanted to protect themselves. Whereas from a public health perspective, when there are limited masks, the masks should be worn by those who are infected.

With SARS, people were only infectious after they developed symptoms. And before March 2020, the only reports of pre-symptomatic Covid transmission were lousy China anecdotes. What's worse is that a high profile NEJM article about a Chinese conference attendee in Germany spreading before symptoms developed was [torn apart](https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-non-symptomatic-patient-transmitting-coronavirus-wrong) after it was discovered that she fell ill enough to take acetominophen/paracetemol. If there was no such thing as pre-symptomatic transmission, then the general public didn't need to wear masks unless they had symptoms.

But then, 2 well- researched articles demonstrating multiple cases of pre-symptomatic transmission were accepted and published in CDC's journal on March 27 and April 1, 2020.

[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6913e1.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6913e1.htm)

[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6914e1.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6914e1.htm)

On April 2 or 3, CDC then made the U-turn to recommend universal masking, including cloth/homemade masks to protect others from the wearer, rather than the other way around. 

It was absolutely a science-based decision. But the messaging failed to convince the public. And people had a hard time separating the concepts of wearing a mask to protect yourself vs protecting others.",,,,1637199489,{'gid_1': 1},hl2d2b0,False,t3_qw0f3o,False,False,t1_hl136k0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qw0f3o/the_definition_of_fully_vaccinated_is_changing_to/hl2d2b0/,1637533561.0,15,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For about a decade every so often I‚Äôd get these feverish nights. Some nights I felt like I was running a fever other nights I actually was. Towards the end of that decade there were 2 occasions where I had a 103 fever for multiple days and I assumed this was a flu due to it being flu season.

Well at the start of the pandemic my teeth all suddenly shifted. I thought it was weird but figured it was maybe due to my teeth shifting. I had braces as a teen. The bottom teeth had begun to move. I thought that was what had happened.

I go see my dentist. He sends me to get a root canal through a tooth I had a big filling in. It stank like death. I had dead nerves under the tooth that began rotting. It had likely been like this for awhile.

Anyway, since having had this root canal done I haven‚Äôt had a fever once nor night chills. Looking back I think occurrences of fever were when I put my body under a lot of stress. This let the bacteria under the tooth spread and cause a fever due to infection. 

Another guy I knew went in and out of hospitals for a decade and was told he had autoimmune of some kind and he was going to die. After an mri a doctor noticed a dental abscess. When he had the tooth removed it was also dead tissue behind it.

This is because it was done so quickly like half a second or less, seemingly, and also it didn't feel as though the needle did anything more than pin prick me. In comparison to my first shot, it felt significantly different, so much that I exclaimed, this time, ""was that it!?"" 

I knew that it's supposed to be a muscular shot and so after  just Googled and an article said that is indeed important that it goes into the muscle. By contrast, the person who administered it told me to go loose and let my arm drop down. And then there was a less than 0.5 second pin prick and it was over. 

What should I do?

A randomized controlled parallel prospective study included 60 patients who underwent COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 2019), post-covid syndrome (ICD-10: U09.9) during the recovery period, who had clinical manifestations of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) who received standard therapy according to the protocol for the management of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (ICD-10: G93.3): physiotherapy and ancillary drug therapy with drugs containing magnesium, B vitamins and L-carnitine. The study participants were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (main, n = 30) received daily inhalation of APV; (H (H 2 O) m) for 90 minutes for 10 days. (apparatus ""SUISONIA"" Japan), group 2 (control, n = 30) received standard therapy. Patients of both groups were comparable in gender and average age: in the main group - 53 (22; 70) years old, in the control group - 51 (25; 70) years. All patients on the 1st and 10th days. Observations determined biological markers of systemic inflammation, oxygen transport, lactate metabolism, intrapulmonary shunting, 6-minute exercise test, and vascular endothelial function.  
  
Results. In the main group, a decrease in indicators was revealed: the stiffness index (SI) from 8.8 ¬± 1.8 to 6.8 ¬± 1.5 m / s (p &lt;0.0001), the activity of alanine aminotransferase from 24.0 ¬± 12.7 up to 20.22 ¬± 10.61 U / L (p &lt;0.001), venous blood lactate level from 2.5 ¬± 0.8 to 1.5 ¬± 1.0 mmol / L (p &lt;0.001), capillary blood lactate level from 2.9 ¬± 0.8 to 2.0 ¬± 0.8 mmol / l (p &lt;0.0001), the calculated index of the intrapulmonary blood shunt (Qs / Qt, according to the Berggren method, 1942) from 8.98 ¬± 5 , 7 to 5.34 ¬± 3.2 (p &lt;0.01), the number of leukocytes from 6.64 ¬± 1.57 to 5.92 ¬± 1.32 10x9 U / L and an increase in the following parameters: reflection index (RI) with up to 46.67 ¬± 13.26 63,32 ¬± 13,44% (p &lt;0.0001), the minimum blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2) during exercise from 92.25 ¬± 2.9 to 94.25 ¬± 1.56% (p &lt;0.05), direct bilirubin from 2.99 ¬± 1.41 to 3.39 ¬± 1.34 Œºmol / L , (p &lt;0.01), partial tension of venous blood oxygen (PcO 2 ) from 26.9 ¬± 5.0 to 34.8 ¬± 5.6 mm Hg. (p &lt;0.0001), venous blood oxygen saturation (SvO 2 ) from 020.6 ¬± 51.8 to 018.1 ¬± 61.1% (p &lt;0.05), partial capillary blood oxygen tension (PsO 2 ) from 48.7 ¬± 15.4 to 63.8 ¬± 21.2 mm Hg (p &lt;0.01), capillary blood saturation (SsO 2 ) from 82.2 ¬± 4.2 to 86.2 ¬± 4.8% (p &lt;0.01), the distance covered in 6 minutes with a 429 ¬± 45 0 to 569 ¬± 60 m.  
  
Conclusion. Inhalation therapy with AFV; (H (H 2 O) m ) in the rehabilitation program of patients who underwent COVID-19, during the recovery period, turned out to be a safe and highly effective treatment method. Positive dynamics was noted in the form of a decrease in the manifestations of latent hypoxemia, an increase in exercise tolerance, and a decrease in endothelial dysfunction. From laboratory tests, there is a decrease in the number of leukocytes, normalization of lactate metabolism, and a decrease in the fraction of intrapulmonary blood shunting from right to left.

The vaccine is developed using¬†Whole-Virion Inactivated Vero Cell¬†derived platform technology. Inactivated vaccines do not replicate and are therefore unlikely to revert and cause pathological effects. They contain dead virus, incapable of infecting people but still able to instruct the immune system to mount a defensive reaction against an infection.

Also is better defense against emerging variants according to the data. Why does the United States not provide vaccine equity and giving everyone an equal choice if they want the pandemic to end?

This is simply not true. Most deaths and hospitalizations are in old people, but cases are not.

The deaths and hospitalizations were then mostly (but not exclusively) older people, but the reason they got infected was almost entirely due to the insane spread among unvaccinated younger people. Until then cases were really low, and it is absolutely clear from the timeline that the unvaccinated were the cause of the peak, which ended up affecting the vaccinated older population (since protection is not perfect as we all know).

We developed, trialed, and began a mass rollout of vaccines in less than a year. We knew two things about them: they were safe, and at least over the trial window, highly effective. 

While everyone was optimistic (myself included) that the two-dose vaccines would be durable, I don't think anyone is *surprised* that they are not. That does not mean that they cannot be made to be more durable through an improved dosing schedule (which, unsurprisingly, was not a priority in testing given the incredibly compressed timeline for development). 

Regardless, there will not be a permanent 6 month booster schedule. A more effective dosing schedule will be figured out (e.g., first dose, second dose two months later, third dose eight months later, etc) potentially followed by annual boosters being the worst case scenario. 

We did two doses in super rapid succession despite most people not believing it was optimal.

Sweden is not ‚Äúslightly slower‚Äù growth rate.  They simply didn‚Äòt have any exponential growth at all throughout delta.  And as far as we know, natural immunity is roughly equivalent to a partial vaccination.  You‚Äòre making my point by implying natural immunity could be another factor.

Eligibility criteria for study selection Observational and interventional studies that assessed the effectiveness of public health measures in reducing the incidence of covid-19, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and covid-19 mortality.  
  
Main outcome measures The main outcome measure was incidence of covid-19. Secondary outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 transmission and covid-19 mortality.  
  
Data synthesis DerSimonian Laird random effects meta-analysis was performed to investigate the effect of mask wearing, handwashing, and physical distancing measures on incidence of covid-19. Pooled effect estimates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were computed, and heterogeneity among studies was assessed using Cochran‚Äôs Q test and the I2 metrics, with two tailed P values.  
  
Results 72 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 35 evaluated individual public health measures and 37 assessed multiple public health measures as a ‚Äúpackage of interventions.‚Äù Eight of 35 studies were included in the meta-analysis, which indicated a reduction in incidence of covid-19 associated with handwashing (relative risk 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 1.12, I2=12%), mask wearing (0.47, 0.29 to 0.75, I2=84%), and physical distancing (0.75, 0.59 to 0.95, I2=87%). Owing to heterogeneity of the studies, meta-analysis was not possible for the outcomes of quarantine and isolation, universal lockdowns, and closures of borders, schools, and workplaces. The effects of these interventions were synthesised descriptively.  
  
Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that several personal protective and social measures, including handwashing, mask wearing, and physical distancing are associated with reductions in the incidence covid-19. Public health efforts to implement public health measures should consider community health and sociocultural needs, and future research is needed to better understand the effectiveness of public health measures in the context of covid-19 vaccination.

Sweden didn't have any exponential growth at all between May - Nov 2020 either because covid is highly seasonal in Sweden.

Last winter Sweden followed the same growth as the rest of europe but 6 weeks delayed. The government now expects high spread in winter has introduced vaccine passes for the first time which is the harshest restriction there has ever been in Sweden.

&gt;And as far as we know, natural immunity is roughly equivalent to a partial vaccination.

Natural immunity against delta is around 5-6x as effective against infection compared to full vaccination.

So, for instance your argument with PPE overlooks the fact that the issue wasn't that governments couldn't distribute PPE but that there wasn't enough PPE globally to go around. If you recall, the biggest issue was that there were shortages on masks (especially N95). That wouldn't have been solved by further more global lockdowns. 

&gt;It sounds like your argument is ""we should just reopen everything to full and never wear masks and not get vaccinated because all of these things just slow it down and it's not even that bad.""

Oh come on. I'm triple vaccinated. Vaccines are a proven effective measure and should be the primary method of mitigation and control. 

Masks are mild to moderately efficacious in social settings, highly efficacious when used properly in medical settings. I 100% support masks.

No way to know how long because it‚Äôs only been a year or so since the first people were vaccinated in clinical trials. Some immunologists and doctors also think that our very close spacing of the first two doses ended up looking more like one dose to the immune system, since it takes time for the immune system to build its response, so the third dose is really more like dose 2.

By Linda Searing November 15, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. EST


At least 50 percent of people who survive covid-19 experience a variety of physical and psychological health issues for six months or more after their initial recovery, according to research on the long-term effects of the disease, published in the journal JAMA Network Open.

Tracker: U.S. coronavirus cases, deaths and hospitalizations
Often referred to as ‚Äúlong covid,‚Äù the adverse health effects vary from person to person. But the research, based on data from 250,351 adults and children, found that more than half experience a decline in general well-being, resulting in weight loss, fatigue, fever or pain.


About 20 percent have decreased mobility, 25 percent have trouble thinking or concentrating (called ‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù), 30 percent develop an anxiety disorder, 25 percent have breathing problems, and 20 percent have hair loss or skin rashes. Cardiovascular issues ‚Äî chest pain and palpitations ‚Äî are common, as are stomach and gastrointestinal problems.


Those affected by post-covid conditions, sometimes called ‚Äúlong haulers,‚Äù can include anyone who has had covid-19, even those who had no symptoms or just mild ones, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But additional research published in a subsequent issue of the journal found that cognitive dysfunction has occurred more often among those who had more severe cases of covid-19 and required hospitalization, and their brain fog issues have lingered for seven months or more. ‚ÄúOne‚Äôs battle with covid doesn‚Äôt end with recovery from the acute infection,‚Äù one researcher said.

If you kept around a full set of antibodies for every antigen you ever ran into in your life, your blood would end up too thick to flow.   So antibodies naturally wane to make space for new ones.

So running into an antigen again after some period of time will trigger more antibody production and nudge the immune system into keeping that family of antibodies around for longer.

There's also the sort of funny mathematical oddity that was occurring a few months back when vaccine distribution was even more skewed toward the vulnerable populations than it is now.  Basically, you can't get an idea of how effective a vaccine is just by looking at aggregate numbers.  You have to condition your observations on, say, age or underlying conditions and such.  (Case counts for vaccinated people were inflated because vaccinated people tended to be older and more vulnerable anyway!)

When you control for those kinds of factors, you find an even large gap between the vaccinated and unvaccinated.

I was in a conference room three weeks ago with someone who tested positive shortly after but no one else, all vaxed, got sick. 

My take on this:
1) vaccines are still pretty good
2) we may only need to get 1/4 or so of the population boosters at this point to get enough dead end hosts to put us to at least intermediate term herd immunity. Figure recent infections,  and okay protection remaining with non-boosted should push us over the edge.

Over the past several months as more clinical trials in United States were conducted using thousands of participants (across a variety of Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers), no new safety concerns were identified. These trials specifically included organ transplant recipients and severely immunocompromised individuals.

[What is compelling is the additional approval allowing for the mixing of vaccines as the booster dose. This leaves most of us to essentially choose which booster we would like to receive. Additionally, this removes any issue with trying to find a location that only has the original manufacturer you received, creating a more streamlined process and easier access to higher protection. There is already preliminary research from multiple countries confirming the mRNA type vaccines are best placed to deliver a higher antibody response compared to their non-mRNA type peers. The findings for an NIH preprint study have been summarized below (see Chart 2), which can aid you in determining which booster type may be best based on your initial series.](https://www.drswanda.com/post/covid-19-boosters-the-shield-to-our-armor)",,,,1637241723,{},hl48gnd,False,t3_qw6xbp,False,True,t1_hl1cxif,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qw6xbp/moderna_submits_fda_application_to_authorize/hl48gnd/,1637570443.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 88 percent of the District of Columbia‚Äôs adult residents have received at least one vaccine dose, according to city health officials.

Masks will still be required in certain circumstances, including on public transportation, inside school buildings and in congregate living facilities like nursing homes, college dormitories and jails.

Ms. Bowser said the easing of the mandate did not mean that people should stop wearing masks entirely. ‚ÄúIt does mean that we‚Äôre shifting the government‚Äôs response to providing you this risk-based information, and recommending layering strategies, as the best way to protect yourself and the community,‚Äù she said during a news conference.

Washington imposed its current mask mandate in July after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised everyone, whether vaccinated or not, to resume wearing face coverings in indoor public spaces if they lived in an area where the virus was spreading rapidly. The agency defined those areas as places that reported more than 50 new infections for every 100,000 residents over the previous seven days, or where more than 8 percent of tests had come back positive over that period.

As of Tuesday, the District of Columbia was above that threshold, with 81 new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days, according to the C.D.C.

I mean take Munich as an example.  We have one ""main"" vaccination center, and it's in a really shitty location for most.  I live fairly close to the city center yet it would take almost an hour each way with public transport if I had to get vaxed there.  In addition, for all this time you could ONLY get vaccinated at that center (or a doc's office, though many did not offer it), even if you lived closer to a vax center in neighboring towns.  So the Munich center was endlessly booked out while the centers just outside the city were wide open for appointments, but you couldn't get an appointment in those locations if you are a resident of Munich, proper.  Just ridiculous.

I am personally lucky that I was able to get vaccinated fairly early through my primary doc, but most people I know had to go to some serious effort to get their shots.  And they wonder why vax rates are relatively low?!   

As of two days ago they finally - FINALLY - started offering vaccines at the existing large scale testing centers in town, too.  These are more centrally located and easily accessible for far more people and opening them for vaccines expands capacity, naturally.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‚Äôs independent committee of vaccine experts has scheduled a meeting for Friday to discuss data on the booster dose‚Äôs efficacy and safety. If both the F.D.A. and the C.D.C. sign off this week, they will have acted strikingly quickly ‚Äî a little more than a week after Pfizer asked for authorization of boosters for everyone 18 and older.

Under that scenario, any adult who received a second dose of the vaccine at least six months earlier would be officially eligible to get a booster as soon as this weekend. The F.D.A. is expected to rule without consulting its own expert panel, which has met frequently during the pandemic to review vaccine data and make a recommendation ahead of a regulatory decision.

Moderna is expected to soon submit its own request for the F.D.A. to broaden eligibility for its booster. But for now, every adult could get the Pfizer booster, according to people familiar with the planning.

The broad booster authorization has been viewed as something of a fait accompli for weeks. Some state and local officials have begun rolling out similar policies ahead of F.D.A. action ‚Äî responding to persistent virus case counts and the eagerness of many Americans to seek additional protection ahead of holiday gatherings.

New York City health officials on Monday encouraged all adults who want boosters to seek them out. Arkansas, California, Colorado and New Mexico have already moved to expand access.

Many Americans have taken the matter into their own hands and sought out extra doses even if they do not officially qualify yet.

[Graph of waning vaccine effectiveness]

The F.D.A. in September downsized Pfizer-BioNTech‚Äôs request to fully approve booster doses for all adults, instead signing off on a more limited population, including those 65 and older, as well as adults with underlying medical conditions or those at risk because of their jobs.

At least 30 to 40 percent of vaccinated adults are still excluded from booster eligibility, according to some estimates.

More than 30 million people have gotten additional shots, with the number often outpacing the number of first shots given each day around the country. Booster doses were also authorized in October for everyone who received the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, and for vulnerable groups who received Moderna‚Äôs two-dose shot.

The C.D.C.‚Äôs gathering on Friday is scheduled to be briefer than recent meetings about Covid vaccines, just three hours, and is expected to be straightforward, one federal official familiar with the planning said, in part because of how far the nation‚Äôs booster campaign has come. That would suggest a significant softening of opposition among public health experts since President Biden announced in August that he hoped to offer booster doses to all adults.",,,,1637245950,{},hl4h3qi,True,t3_qwqzjb,False,True,t3_qwqzjb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qwqzjb/the_fda_plans_to_authorize_pfizerbiontech/hl4h3qi/,1637574849.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Starting on Monday, people without a vaccination pass or proof of a previous Covid infection will not be allowed into the country‚Äôs restaurants or bars or be able to use indoor services such as hair salons. They will also be barred from attending large events.

The country recorded 22,511 Covid cases on Tuesday, the highest number since the pandemic began, but the streets of Prague were full a day later as people celebrated the 32nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution that toppled the Communist regime.

About 10,000 of those gathered used the opportunity to protest Covid restrictions and vaccinations, according to the police.

Only 58 percent of people in the Czech Republic are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, placing the country in the bottom half of European Union statistics. To raise the numbers, the government has started a media campaign showing pictures of people who have died from Covid.

The products were meant for clients around the world as nations scramble to inoculate their people and bring the pandemic to an end, but instead Mr. Nath‚Äôs warehouses were left with stocks of more than 45 million syringes that he had largely promised to UNICEF and the Pan American Health Organization.

And with India‚Äôs export restrictions on syringes in place through the end of this year, experts say the world could experience a shortfall of two billion to four billion needles through the end of next year. The shortages are expected to hit African countries the hardest.

‚ÄúThat will be truly disappointing,‚Äù said Prashant Yadav ‚Äî a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, a Washington research organization, and an expert on health care supply chains ‚Äî ‚Äúthat after having waited for over a year to get a reasonable quantity of vaccines, when they do obtain the vaccines, they don‚Äôt have syringes to administer them.‚Äù

Although India is a small player in overall global exports, it is a major producer of the type of syringe that is being used globally for coronavirus vaccinations. The syringes break on second use to prevent the spreading of disease through reuse.

Covax, the vaccine-sharing initiative, is seeking the syringes from manufacturers around the world, and India was expected to meet at least 15 percent of the global demand for use with Covid vaccines and other inoculations.

The situation became so acute last month that the World Health Organization and PAHO asked India to allow Mr. Nath‚Äôs company, Hindustan Syringes and Medical Devices, one of the world‚Äôs largest syringe makers, to ship the orders it had agreed to before the restrictions were announced. Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs government subsequently increased the export quota for the health organizations but did not allow a blanket exemption.

The World Health Organization and UNICEF have warned that the syringe shortage could have ‚Äúdire consequences‚Äù for the global vaccination effort.

In India, more than half of the 1.4 billion-strong population has received at least one shot of a Covid vaccine, but only 28 percent of people are fully vaccinated, according to a New York Times database. And new inoculations have slowed recently.
Unlike vaccine doses, syringes are bulky and are typically transported by sea. The shortage comes amid large disruptions in the global supply chain of shipped goods, and experts say that a Covax-like initiative is needed, with nations coming together to better supply syringes to poorer countries.

UNICEF, a major buyer of syringes for Covax, said in a statement on Wednesday that ‚Äúsyringe nationalism‚Äù could be addressed if big producers and wealthy countries ‚Äúinfluence global markets in a way that unlocks access for other countries in the global south.‚Äù

The agency also said it was considering expanding use of another type of syringe approved by the W.H.O. that also prevents reuse.

Dozens of Indian syringe makers spent millions of dollars to scale up manufacturing last year, but buyers are increasingly relying on manufacturers in China.

ProcureNet, a Hong Kong-based supplier of pharmaceutical products, said this week that it would invest $20 million in Anhui Tiankang Medical, a Chinese manufacturer, to produce 750 million syringes for PAHO and other buyers.

‚ÄúEvery man and mouse who can vaccinate should vaccinate now,‚Äù Lothar Wieler, the head of the agency, the Robert Koch Institute, said in a video discussion with the leader of Saxony, the German state with the highest infection rates.

‚ÄúOtherwise,‚Äù Dr. Wieler added, ‚Äúwe will not get this crisis under control.‚Äù

The apparently off-the-cuff remarks by a normally composed scientist came as Germany posted yet another record in daily new infections. The agency on Wednesday reported more than 65,000 new cases ‚Äî a 61 percent increase over two weeks earlier ‚Äî and 264 deaths.

Graph of cases

On Thursday, lawmakers in Parliament approved a bill whose measures include a rule that only people who are vaccinated against the virus, have recovered from an infection or test negative can ride public transit or attend work in person. Less than 70 percent of Germany‚Äôs population is fully vaccinated.

The new measures, proposed by the parties that are expected to replace Chancellor Angela Merkel in government, would also require employers to offer a work-from-home option when possible.

To come into force, the rules must also be approved by the leaders of Germany‚Äôs 16 states, a move that is expected to occur on Friday. Since proposing the bill early last week, the parties have tightened some of the proposals amid criticism that the measures were insufficient to curb the latest outbreak.

Saxony‚Äôs governor, Michael Kretschmer, said on Thursday that his state‚Äôs lawmakers would vote on tough new lockdown measures on Friday. He described the restrictions as a ‚Äúhard, clear wave breaker‚Äù that would last several weeks.

Practices such as improved ventilation and air filtration are being considered by schools to reduce the transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Improved ventilation may significantly increase the energy cost of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), exacerbating financial challenges schools face amidst the worst pandemic in decades. This study evaluated HVAC energy costs for reducing COVID-19 airborne infection risks in 111,485 public and private schools in the U.S. to support decision-makings. The average annual HVAC energy cost to maintain the infection risk below 1% for the schools in the U.S. is estimated at $20.1 per square meter or $308.4 per capita with improved ventilation and air filtration, where the private schools have higher costs than the public schools on average. The cost could be reduced by adopting partial online learning. It was also found that additional cost to control infection risk with increased ventilation and air filtration is significantly lower for PK-5 schools than that for middle and high schools, indicating the possibility of remaining in-person instructions for PK-5 schools with necessary governmental assistance. Analyses of school HVAC energy costs to reduce airborne infection risks under different intervention scenarios provide important operational guidelines, financial implications, and policy insights for schools, community stakeholders, and policymakers to keep schools safe during the ongoing pandemic and improve preparedness for epidemics projected in the future.",,,,1637244895,{},hl4et66,True,t3_qwqmye,False,True,t3_qwqmye,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qwqmye/nationwide_assessment_of_energy_costs_and/hl4et66/,1637573695.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The new analysis suggests that the first known patient sickened with the coronavirus was a vendor in a large Wuhan animal market, not an accountant who lived many miles from it.

The report, published on Thursday in the prestigious journal Science, will revive, though certainly not settle, the debate over whether the pandemic started with a spillover from wildlife sold at the market, a leak from a Wuhan virology lab or some other way. The search for the origins of the greatest public health catastrophe in a century has fueled geopolitical battles, with few new facts emerging in recent months to resolve the question.

The scientist, Michael Worobey, a leading expert in tracing the evolution of viruses at the University of Arizona, came upon timeline discrepancies by combing through what had already been made public in medical journals, as well as video interviews in a Chinese news outlet with people believed to have the first two documented infections.

Dr. Worobey argues that the vendor‚Äôs ties to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as well as a new analysis of the earliest hospitalized patients‚Äô connections to the market, strongly suggest that the pandemic began there.",,,,1637263632,{},hl5p9tg,True,t3_qwxgmq,False,False,t3_qwxgmq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qwxgmq/first_known_covid_case_was_vendor_at_wuhan_market/hl5p9tg/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,97c4b1f05730201adb356b9229e7dd6cb8f249d4,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1637263644.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

&gt;With SARS, live-animal markets continued to sell infected animals for many months, allowing zoonotic spillover to be established as the origin and revealing multiple independent jumps from animals into humans (3). Unfortunately, no live mammal collected at Huanan Market or any other live-animal market in Wuhan has been screened for SARS-CoV-2‚Äìrelated viruses (1), and Huanan Market was closed and disinfected on 1 January 2020. Nevertheless, that most early symptomatic cases were linked to Huanan Market‚Äîspecifically to the western section (1) where raccoon dogs were caged (2)‚Äîprovides strong evidence of a live-animal market origin of the pandemic.

&gt;This would explain the extraordinary preponderance of early COVID-19 cases at one of the handful of sites in Wuhan‚Äîpopulation 11 million‚Äîthat sell some of the same animals that brought us SARS. Although it may never be possible to recover related viruses from animals if they were not sampled at the time of emergence, conclusive evidence of a Huanan Market origin from infected wildlife may nonetheless be obtainable through analysis of spatial patterns of early cases and from additional genomic data, including SARS-CoV-2‚Äìpositive samples from Huanan Market, as well as through integration of additional epidemiologic data.

This is how I think of it.  Let's say you get a booster.  Your immune system recognizes the same virus and pumps the antibodies out to clear it out again.  While the antibodies are still in your bloodstream if you encountered Covid 19 in the wild you would theoretically be almost immune to infection entirely.

Severe illness is what happens while your immune system figures out the correct counter-attack strategy.  If it knows what to do almost right away, that's good and you get mild symptoms.  Maybe none.

The question really is, how much ""training"" for your immune system is ""good enough.""
And what is the ""Max level"" that can even be achieved?
  
0 training- no vax- obviously bad.                                   
2 shots - based on the hospitalization data I still think this is pretty damn good.                                        
3 shots - ??? really, we just don't know.  The question to me is can you really ""train"" your immune system for much more preparedness than 2 shots?  

Based on what I've seen, and experienced, I'm still not convinced boosters are really needed for most people, and think they should have been prioritized only for people with weaker immune systems that can maybe benefit from additional ""training"".  
Vaccine production should have been retargeted to focus on countries still struggling to get enough vaccines for their first 2 doses.  But the boosters are made now so whatever...

Should vaccinations be given despite other illnesses?

Often indicated vaccinations are not given because certain circumstances are mistakenly viewed as contraindications. It is known from surveys and studies that one of the main reasons for low vaccination coverage is these contraindications, which are often misunderstood by doctors and used improperly. It should therefore be pointed out again, especially in this context, that common infections, even if they are associated with subfebrile temperatures (‚â§ 38.5 ¬∞ C = 101.3 F), are not a contraindication to vaccination.

Other false contraindications are e.g .:

A possible contact of the vaccinee to people with infectious diseases,

Family seizures

Febrile convulsions in the anamnesis of the vaccinee (since febrile vaccination reactions can provoke a seizure, consideration should be given to giving antipyretic drugs to children with a tendency to convulsions: e.g. in the case of dead vaccines at the time of vaccination and 4 and 8 hours after vaccination as well as in the case of the MMR vaccination between 7th and 12th day in the event of a temperature increase),

Eczema,

Dermatoses,

localized skin infections,

Treatment with antibiotics or with low doses of corticosteroids or topical steroid-containing preparations,

Pregnancy of the mother of the vaccinee,

congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies when vaccinated with dead vaccines,

Neonatal jaundice,

Prematurity: premature babies should be vaccinated according to the recommended vaccination age regardless of their birth weight,

chronic illnesses as well
non-progressive diseases of the CNS.

Indicated vaccinations should be carried out in particular in people with chronic diseases, since these people are particularly at risk due to the severe course and complications of vaccine-preventable diseases. People with chronic diseases should be educated about the benefits of the vaccination compared to the risk of the disease. There is no reliable knowledge that any flare-ups occurring at the same time as the vaccination could be caused by a vaccination. https://www.rki.de/SharedDocs/FAQ/Impfen/AllgFr_Kontraindi/FAQ04.html",,,,1637262836,{},hl5n9ws,False,t3_qwkwoa,False,False,t1_hl5eioi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qwkwoa/daily_discussion_thread_november_18_2021/hl5n9ws/,1637598338.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So again, they‚Äôre not actually saying that a study has medium bias, they‚Äôre saying that a study has the potential to have medium bias, likely based off the differences between the study population and the reference population. In this case, when they say a study is at low risk of bias, that‚Äôs great to hear, because that is the best possible outcome we can get for a study. (The only way to get a study with no risk of bias would be to literally include every person in the reference population - here, the entire US - into a trial. This is obviously infeasible.) It also looks like they included eight studies, not just the ones with low risk of bias, for most of the outcomes and did their best to correct for bias.

In general, to generate memory T cells with high proliferative potential and memory B cells that have to go through the germinal center reaction and take several months to develop, it is better to have an interval of at least 2‚Äì3 months between the prime and the boost \[42\].... Recent studies have also suggested that increasing the time intervals between immunizations during a prime‚Äìboost protocol may permit increased differentiation of effector memory cells to central memory cells before boosting and thereby enhance the effectiveness of the immunizations \[17\]. 

From what I remember from high school biology, when the immune system sees a new pathogen, the B cells (which make antibodies) rapidly mutate in order to produce cells make the best antibodies for the pathogen. Spacing out the doses might give the cells time to make better antibodies, and the booster triggers the immune system to make more antibodies in general.

Happy to provide a source for that if you want.

Are you offering to provide negative-proof? I'm not being sassy, I'm trying to clarify.

If so, the practical proof that it's not reducing fertility rates is that it so far *has not*. We've been injecting people since January. We have 11 months of data, both empirical and anecdotal -- and people sure love anecdotal evidence right now.

I have been pretty rigorously keeping up with the state of things (though I am just one individual, not a fact-checking borough). I have not heard of any uptick in infertility rates as a result of the vaccines. I have however, seen the opposing point that COVID affects male virility/fertility, as well as that pregnancy increases risk and severity of COVID infections.

Further, I know people like to crap on the CDC right now, while simultaneously praising the same exact science journals they get most of their data from, but the CDC has, and continues to monitor fertility and pregnancy data with their VSafe system.
 
&gt;The cons of giving them that power far outweigh the benefit

We do need to draw the line somewhere. We do not, and cannot allow the US to become a dictatorship.

Guano has been collected for fertilizing fields in different parts of the world for many years. I have never heard about a virus originating from this activity.

I strongly believe that the virus originated in one of China's wild animal farms where wild animals (as opposed to domesticated animals) are kept under cramped conditions in cages very different from their natural habitat. The Chinese government promoted the cultivation of wild animals to increase prosperity in rural regions and to narrow the wealth gap with the cities. Wild and rare animals fetch a higher price than domesticated animals. Wealthy Chinese are willing to pay a high price for the kick of getting some exotic dish which is supposed to have some special health effects.

The stress wild animals experience in these unnatural surroundings can explain diseases and the cramped conditions make sure that infectious diseases are transmitted.

What is the benefit of that? Because I also remember hearing that antibodies are only one aspect of immunity and low antibody levels does not necessarily correlate with a poor immune response. 

Does having more antibodies launch the immune response faster? Or more robustly?

Is there any downside of tricking the body to keep the antibodies around longer? Would there be a downside if you got several vaccines all at once?

He thinks Covid vaccines are neither effective nor safe but a way to make money for pharmaceutical companies and corrupt politicians who are taking away his freedom.

Under state rules to stem coronavirus infections, he is no longer allowed to go to restaurants, to the bowling alley, to the cinema or to the hairdresser. From next week, he will be barred from entering most shops, too. But that has only strengthened his resolve.

‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt break me,‚Äù said Mr. M√ºller, 40, a bar owner in the town of Annaberg-Buchholz, in the Ore Mountain region in the eastern state of Saxony where the vaccination rate is 44 percent ‚Äî the lowest in Germany.

Mr. M√ºller personifies a problem that is as sharp in some parts of Europe as it is in the United States. If Germany had red and blue states, Saxony would be crimson. In places like this, pockets of unvaccinated people are driving the latest round of contagion, filling strained hospital wards, putting economic recoveries at risk and sending governments scrambling to head off a fourth wave of the pandemic.

Even as studies show that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection ‚Äî and to avoid hospitalization or death if infected ‚Äî persuading those who are deeply skeptical of vaccines has proved all but impossible. Instead, Western European governments are resorting increasingly to thinly veiled coercion with a mixture of mandates, inducements and punishments.

In many countries, it is working. When President Emmanuel Macron announced in July that vaccine passports would be required to enter most social venues, France ‚Äî where anti-vaccine sentiment was strong ‚Äî was one of the least vaccinated countries in Europe. Today it has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world.

Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy followed Mr. Macron‚Äôs lead with even tougher measures. There, and in Spain, too, attempts by populist parties to stoke a broad-based anti-vaccine backlash have largely been snuffed out.

But regional resistance against the coronavirus vaccine remains. In Central and Eastern Europe ‚Äî and in the German-speaking countries and regions bordering them ‚Äî the problem is more stubborn.
In Italy, the northern province of Bolzano ‚Äî bordering Austria and Switzerland, where 70 percent of the population is German-speaking ‚Äî has the country‚Äôs lowest vaccination rate. Experts have linked a sharp increase in infections there to frequent exchanges with Austria, but also to a cultural inclination among the population toward homeopathy and natural cures.

‚ÄúThere is some correlation with far-right parties, but the main reason is this trust in nature,‚Äù said Patrick Franzoni, a doctor who spearheads the inoculation campaign in the province. Especially in the Alps, he said, the German-speaking population trusts fresh air, organic produce and herbal teas more than traditional drugs.

In fact, Germany, Austria and the German-speaking region of Switzerland have the largest shares of unvaccinated populations in all of Western Europe. About one in four people over 12 are unvaccinated, compared with about one in 10 in France and Italy and almost none in Portugal.

Sociologists say that in addition to an influential culture of alternative medicine, the vaccine resistance is fueled by a strong tradition of decentralized government that tends to feed distrust of rules imposed from the capital ‚Äî and by a far-right ecosystem that knows how to exploit both.

Opposition to vaccines, said Pia Lamberty of CeMAS, a Berlin-based research organization focused on disinformation and conspiracy theories, is in some ways the long tail of the populist nationalist movements that shook up European politics for a decade.

‚ÄúRadical anti-vaxxers are not a huge group, but it‚Äôs big enough to cause a problem in the pandemic,‚Äù Ms. Lamberty said. ‚ÄúIt shows the success of the far-right cheerleading on this issue and the failure of mainstream politicians to take it seriously enough.‚Äù

[],,CheesingmyBrainsOut,,,[],,,,text,t2_g4s0f,False,False,[],"Some background, there's a variety of things that can cause acid reflux. It can be overproduction of stomach acid, esophageal sphincter could not be closing all the way due to damage, among others. One theory is that your body doesn't produce enough stomach acid and therefore overreacts with stomach acid when eating food, with the idea being drinking an acid before a meal can help not produce as much acid. 

At my worst I was going over a toilet a couple times per week regurgitating bile for sometimes hours. There was also the silent nighttime effects, where I would wake up not being able to breathe and have heart palpitations. Anyways, the general approach for myself was that all of the above were wrong. If acid reflux is caused by esophageal sphincter being damaged, I have to let it heal. You can take PPI's for this (I tried, but they gave me horrible side effects), or just try to go all out with the below. Then once healed, gradually ease certain things back in your life.

* Wedge pillow at night. Let your esophagus heal by not subjecting it to acid every night. This is the number #1 for me for long-term prevention, and I notice when I don't use it for a couple days in a row, my throat will be sore.
* Don't eat 3-4 hours + before bed. Gives your stomach acid a chance to die down. Also have a very basic low-fat meal.
* Keep meals small, don't binge eat, don't eat crap. Find your trigger foods and avoid them (alcohol, red wine, orange juice, steak were big triggers for me).
* Eliminate alcohol, soda, caffeine at first to let your esophagus heal, or at least limit it to once per week. These are trigger foods. After your esophagus heals you can gradually re-introduce. But one thing I found is just a single beer can trigger it, so I've moved to drinking once per week.
* Anecdotal, but for about 3-4 years I would drink apple cider vinegar diluted in water before meals. This seemed to help with my stomach acid. Not because of magical properties of ACV, but just because it's acidic. 
* Other supplements helped me at first as well, a big one being chewing DGL Licorice tablets before meals, but watch out as it can trigger certain heart conditions if over-consumed iirc.

For the last 2, I'd research them on your own.

Anyways, the result is I haven't vomited bile in over a decade. I get occasional spasms at night after a weekend of heavy drinking and eating or smoking weed, but am for the most part living life normally.

Your immune system never maintains antibodies.  That's not how it works.  The memory B and T cells retain the coding to remake the antibodies again when needed.  
If your immune system kept your blood full of antibodies for all the viruses ever encountered your blood would flow like molasses.

I personally would bet on boosters actually offering less duration of immunity from infection, as the immune system response to covid is faster and more efficient.  But that's also good in the sense that it would mean your immune system can now effectively handle covid with minimal symptoms, maybe even none.

The key thing here is that immunity from illness and immunity from infection are different things.

high circulating antibodies (recently vaxxed/boosted/recovered) means any intruding viruses get stopped right away.  Hence highly protective against testing positive on a PCR test.

antibodies naturally decline over time, but vaccinated people are still protected because the body will create new antibodies on demand thanks to immune memory.

&gt;According to aggregated data from Statista, Johnson &amp; Johnson earned one third of its pharmaceutical revenue between 2011 and 2015 (about $30 billion) from sales of Remicade ‚Äî a federally funded discovery made at New York University. Similarly, between 2006 and 2015, Amgen derived $90 billion from the sale of Neupogen and Enbrel which were discovered by federally funded researchers at Memorial Sloane Kettering and the University of Texas. 
&gt;Since 1984, patent extensions have provided well over $100 billion in extra monopoly revenue during the period of the extensions. The cholesterol-lowering statin drugs alone generated $60 billion from patent extensions and another $5 billion from pediatric extensions. For that $5 billion the government could have covered the entire cost of thestudies needed for the 200 drugs that have received the pediatric patent extension. Instead, the pediatric extensions generated many billions in extra revenue for dozens of blockbuster drugs having annual sales of $1 to several billion per year.

&gt;A huge portion of those Xtandi sales have been paid by US patients and taxpayers. The US market accounts for the majority of Xtandi revenues, with Medicare alone paying $633 million in 2015, at a rate of over $100,000 per Xtandi patient per year And, as it turns out, US taxpayers are not just this drug's biggest customer: they are the ones who funded its invention in the first place.

&gt;These drugmakers are now increasingly straddling both sides of the courtroom, too, protecting their high-price products from biosimilars - biopharmaceutical drugs with the treatment properties of medicines they seek to mimic - while simultaneously challenging rivals' patent claims.
&gt;For instance, AbbVie has sued in Delaware claiming patent protection for its arthritis drug Humira, the world's best-selling prescription medicine, until at least 2022 as it seeks to delay an Amgen replica that won U.S. approval last week. Meanwhile, Amgen has gone to another U.S. federal court seeking to protect its own arthritis medicine, Enbrel, from a Novartis biosimilar until 2029. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pharmaceuticals-biosimilars-idUSKCN12208Q

[],,DoomPaDeeDee,,,[],,,,text,t2_w0y2t,False,False,[],"By ""limited means"" I didn't mean the very poor, just the non-wealthy.  My view is influenced by where I live.  I was specifically thinking about all the 20- and 30-somethings that moved back in with their parents in their hometowns. Many of them didn't make a bunch of money and when all the fun stuff shut down and they lost their jobs or their offices closed in a switch to telecommuting, they skipped town.  

Some people, especially those with children, did move to the suburbs, that was a clear trend.  However, a lot of those people were probably thinking about it already.  Many young couples live in the city until it's time to have children and then they either move before they have them or once the kids are old enough for school, mostly to Long Island or New Jersey.  I see those moves as an acceleration of an existing trend rather than as a new phenomenon, same for people moving to Hudson Valley towns.  

Some of those people may move back, but they may find they can't get all of their money out of the suburban house they bought in a bidding war and that apartments and houses in the city didn't get much cheaper, if any.  It's my understanding that rent in particular has rebounded and there are a bunch of people who signed leases at reduced rates who are being hit with huge increases they can't afford, but it shouldn't come as a surprise. 

There was a burst of apartments changing hands when the situation improved earlier this year, but it was mostly just compressed activity due to the market being dead for so long, not an exodus.  Every apartment that was sold was purchased by someone and the market is basically back to normal.  https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/02/realestate/manhattan-real-estate-sales.html

I've known of people who moved to the Catskills and they did it because housing is dirt cheap compared to here.  I think many of them underestimated the cost in money and time of commuting into the city on those buses that leave very early in the morning and get them back home in the evening.  I don't know how many people did that particular move during the pandemic because I haven't heard or read anything about it.",,,,1637194937,{},hl233ot,False,t3_qw0ix9,False,True,t1_hl1zacb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qw0ix9/nyc_has_regained_threequarters_of_residents_who/hl233ot/,1637527821.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Low-FODMAP diet can offer temporary relief, combine that with gradually re-introducing foods until you identify the trigger diets. Low-FODMAP is not a long term solution, but it is very helpful for when it gets so bad you can't eat anything without pain.

Almost every vaccine requires boosting for durable protection. COVID is not special.
