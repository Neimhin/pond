&gt; How do you explain how australia is currently near the bottom when it comes to vaccine roll out if this had all been about prioritising saving lives all along?

That is the greatest weakness of our approach so far but we are not alone - New Zealand is in a similar situation. The answer is that we have not thrown enough money at vaccine development plus our vaccine orders are slow to arrive, plus our bad luck with Astrazeneca being restricted to over 60s.

- Neither country will achieve total vaccination without forcing vaccines on everyone, including children.
- Vaccines don't entirely stop transmission
- Some vaccinated people can still get covid
- Some (much reduced due to vaccine efficacy) number of those will be hospitalised and die.

Therefore, at a certain point they will be faced with a population that has (at let's say an optimistic figure given [current NZ gov statistics on vaccine acceptance](https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines/covid-19-vaccine-strategy-planning-insights/covid-19-vaccine-research-insights)) 80-85% of adults vaccinated, and no natural immunity. Will they open their borders, given that will definitely cause an exit wave?

Neither country has actually defined any parameters for what their goals are - no thresholds for what they consider ""high [enough] vaccination rates"" for their borders to ever reopen. Since the current ruling parties made great political capital on the back of their much-trumpeted ""zero covid"" strategy, I'm not convinced the incumbents will have the political will to back track on that and admit reality here.

That might have been where the number originated from, as a ballpark estimate by epidemiologists, but it's not anymore with the Delta variant. When a disease becomes more contagious, the threshold for herd immunity increases. Also, herd immunity isn't black and white like an on/off switch.

&gt;Of those who were hospitalized, 38 had what were defined as ‚Äúpoor outcomes,‚Äù meaning they were mechanically ventilated or had died.

&gt;Specifically, 71% had hypertension; 48% diabetes; 27% congestive heart failure; 24% chronic kidney disease; 24% chronic lung disease; 19% dementia; and 24% cancer. Only 6% did not have any underlying medical condition.

&gt;Moreover, the study showed that 40% of patients were immunocompromised.

&gt;‚ÄùIf your immune system does not function well, you are at higher risk for not developing protection from vaccination,‚Äù Brosh said, adding that some 35% of patients had no detectable antibodies ‚Äì meaning they had failed to mount an immune response to the vaccine.

&gt;The median time that elapsed from the second dose to hospitalization was 40 days. The median age of the patients was 71. In most cases the source of the patient‚Äôs infection was unknown.

&gt;Brosh said that although this study was conducted when the Alpha variant was active in Israel and the majority of cases had that virus strain, he said it is likely that the characteristics still apply currently ‚Äì to those who are infected with the Delta variant that now accounts for more than 90% of infections in Israel.

What are the numbers for Pfizer/Moderna inoculated Indonesian healthcare workers? The latest data on healthcare workers from there did not specify the vaccinated/unvaccinated groups to derive efficacy vs death. The data from May and early June had 26 dead - 10 in vaccinated and 16 in unvaccinated with 90% vaccination rate (i.e. there are 9x more vaccinated than unvaccinated and they had lower deaths), which gives Sinovac ~93% efficacy vs death, other studies (Turkish, Chilean) all kept the efficacies vs death in the 80-100% range. Where did you get the 60% from?

&gt;Does that restrict me from wishing to have vaccine whose efficacy is the highest ?

It does not help when you say that vaccine is ineffective (blatant misinformation) or countries should ""wait"" for a certain vaccine when there is a shortage of them, yes. There were multiple cases when people read some stuff on Internet and wanted to ""wait"" for other vaccine, and ended up dead or in hospital. [Example (first paragraph)](https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-brazil-coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-20bd94d28ac7b373d7a8f3f9c557e5b6).

You suggesting people to wait for Pfizer will lead to more deaths and collapse of the medical system because e.g. Pfizer's first batch will arrive in August and the number of doses per month is in the 7.5-12 mil doses, which is enough to fully cover 2% or less of the population.",,,,1626341677,{},h599a6c,False,t3_ofiksj,False,True,t1_h5986u3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ofiksj/australia_to_send_25_million_astrazeneca_vaccine/h599a6c/,1626502238,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

But that doesn't change the fact that just like with Sinopharm, Orb√°n has been ignoring the safety of millions of Hungarian citizens for the sake of his own authoritarian and corrupt goals, and continues to ignore it by *having opted out of the EU initiative for securing further vaccines by Pfizer*, in order to push Sputnik and Sinopharm even more, and also for the sake of an idiotic but oh so typical decision to have Hungary create its own vaccines - based on the same outdated and expensive method that Sinopharm also uses.

&gt;* Overall rate: 5,374 cases per 100,000 children in the population

&gt;**Hospitalizations (23 states and NYC reported)**

I'd regularly advise people to think long and hard about what the initial goal has been all this time with all those regulations and lockdowns. It's been basically just two things: 1. prevent serious cases as much as possible to 2. prevent the health care system from breaking down completly until vaccination takes effect. Those were the initial goals, nothing great like 'no infections with Covid'.

The delta variant doesn't really do all that much in regard of those metrics. Given the stats from countries with high delta infections **AND** high vaccination rates the comparison with the flu would even be an overstatement this time around in regards to serious cases and deaths. What certainly doesn't help for a levelheaded approach is the constant media hysteria  about it - they really don't want to take their foot off the gas on that one.

‚ÄúIn areas where there is widespread transmission, all adults under the age of 60 and who are in general good health should wear fabric masks when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others. This is particularly important for adults working with children who may have close contact with children and one another.‚Äù

https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-children-and-masks-related-to-covid-19

CDC -

‚ÄúAll schools should implement and layer prevention strategies and should prioritize universal and correct use of masks and physical distancing.‚Äù

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/operation-strategy.html

ODH - 

‚ÄúWhile programs are no longer mandated to follow the transitional pandemic requirements, it is important to note that a significant number of Ohioans, including children under the age of 12, remain unvaccinated. As such, programs should remain vigilant in their efforts to slow the spread of the virus by following all guidance issued from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Schools and Child Care Guidance, updated April 27, 2021.‚Äù

‚ÄúMasks: While masks are no longer required, beginning June 2, 2021, it is STRONGLY ENCOURAGED that providers adhere to CDC guidance, which states that unvaccinated populations should still mask and socially distance.‚Äù

The RKI document linked above contains a break-down into two age groups:

- people over 60 have been double-vaxxed to over 70%, with some undefined number (12-14%?) having received their first shot.

- for people of 18-60 years of age, just over 40% have been double-vaxxed, whereas a not clearly defined estimate of around 16% have received their first shot.

I wished they had a more elaborate age-group breakdown, but this is all I could find. Apart from the fact that less than 2% of minors are fully vaccinated, with about the same number having received their first shot.

----------------------------

Vaccination slowdown: 

49 million people in Germany have received at least one shot of the vaccine; since conservative estimates say that only 52.7 million adult, eligible people are willing to be vaccinated at this point, a slowdown is almost inevitable.

Last week, just under 4,3 million jabs (1st and 2nd doses) were happening in the country; the week before that it were 5 million, and the week before that 5.6 million.

---------------------

Rising case numbers:

Incidence numbers in Germany are much lower than in many other European countries, but they are rising fast. The lowest point was one or two weeks ago at around 5 new cases (rolling 7-day-average) in 100.000 people. Now it is around 8. The government is speaking of a 50 to 55 % rise week-to-week.

Journalists who have broken down the numbers a bit more, say that over the past two weeks these case numbers have actually been rather stable within most age-groups, but that in the 20-29-year age group the number were rising significantly.

In the (even more narrow) age-band of 20-24, the incidence-rate rose from 10 to 19 (per 100.000 people), whereas in the age-group 75-84, it stayed continuously at 1.

[note: some people assume that, as Delta has different sypmtoms, and might not hit most double-vaxxed people hard, many elderly people might just assume they have a bad cold and not get tested, because they think it is unlikely/impossible that they have the virus due to the fact that they are fully vaccinated]",,,,1626313962,{},h584wzk,True,t3_okijgv,False,True,t3_okijgv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/okijgv/some_current_numbers_on_the_german_vaccine_drive/h584wzk/,1626480928,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Check out this 
[great article about how unlikely it is for ""long term"" side effects from the vaccines to show up a few months or years later.](https://www.chop.edu/news/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine)

The J&amp;J vaccine manufacturing mixup that you heard about [isn't a problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/mhhf8x/johnson_johnson_statement_on_us_covid19_vaccine/) There are no tainted or flawed doses from J&amp;J being distributed, all our doses of J&amp;J came from a different manufacturer in the Netherlands and are both safe and effective.

Vaccines given EUA are safe even if you hear about [clotting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mh39g4/blood_clots_and_the_az_vaccine_revisited/) or [growing a third arm.](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/12/04/get-ready-for-false-side-effects)

That the vaccine manufacturers are not liable (you can't sue them, etc.) if you die from their Covid vaccine is a [logical error], that's [true of all vaccines, and really, most medical practices/drugs/etc.]  They just have to warn you about potential risks, [which they actually do a good job of, even though those risks are miniscule.]  Note that this would also be the case (you can't sue them if it hurts you) for any future ""cures"", therapeutics, or other treatments for the disease. 

The vaccine isn't killing anyone. You heard wrong.  Great discussion [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/oc45h0/scientists_quit_journal_board_protesting_grossly/) 

Clotting is so rare from the vaccine and so common from the virus, it's basically not worth talking about.

Should we be excited about a vaccine [that's not 90%+ effective?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lv3h8e/daily_discussion_thread_march_01_2021/gpbwgkf/) Excellent question!

Immunity from infection lasts [*at least 8 months*](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/koxkm1/sarscov2_infection_induces_longlived_bone_marrow/), though [probably a lot longer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/klpvp7/sarscov2specific_t_cell_memory_is_longlasting_in/)  Again, [*at least* 8 months,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ldj06f/immunological_memory_to_sarscov2_assessed_for_up/) though non-antibody immunity may be most important.  It's too soon to say ""lifelong"" but [that is a possibility.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4nkco/the_immune_system_mounts_a_lasting_defense_after/) 

Immunity from the vaccine [lasts *at least 6 months*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l9nfu8/stable_neutralizing_antibody_levels_six_months/) probably a lot,[ lot longer,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6a6pq/durability_of_responses_after_sarscov2_mrna1273/)  probably many years. It's looking like it'll be permanent or [semi-permanent in a good portion](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m1xbz4/sarscov2_mrna_vaccines_induce_a_robust_germinal/) of the population.

Vaccine induced immunity may be [comparable to](https://www.verywellhealth.com/antibodies-from-vaccines-and-from-natural-infection-5092564), or [better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l5whhu/increased_resistance_of_sarscov2_variants_b1351/), or a [LOT better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m8m23c/neutralizing_antibodies_against_sarscov2_variants/), immunity from a previous infection. Especially to [Alpha/Beta.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgxpre/vaccineinduced_immunity_provides_more_robust/) Natual immunity from clearing an infection is highly protective of future infections, but you have to risk the disease in order to get it.

Vaccination and previous infection [reduce viral load, which reduces spread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s). Updated info [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ocygyp/vast_majority_of_breakthrough_infections_in/)

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) article does a good job of explaining the likelihood of vaccines *at least* reducing spread.  [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lf744r/daily_discussion_thread_february_08_2021/gml0gyi/) may help too. Data from [Scotland](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m3tx1n/covid19_vaccine_linked_to_a_reduction_in/). 

[""Moderna vaccine blocks &gt;90% (87-93%) of infections &amp; 91% (89-94%) of transmission.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmqfk4q/)

 This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a great reduction in ability to spread the virus. [Maybe even with just one dose!](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242) You should [get both doses though.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m2mtnv/immune_response_to_sarscov2_variants_of_concern/)

Reinfections are rare, some studies show [less than 1 in 1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kyj0bx/sarscov2_reinfection_in_a_cohort_of_43000/) (maybe in the 1 in 10,000 range, you'll have to read the study, it's awesome).  Reinfections tend to be much milder than previous infections, even those new variants. Check the [comments here](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lm0mc2/prior_covid19_significantly_reduces_the_risk_of/) for some really interesting discussion regarding reinfection.

[Delayed second doses are fine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/layx6g/single_dose_administration_and_the_influence_of/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) At least with [ChAdOx1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), though there is evidence from the mRNA vaccine trials that suggest that up to 6 weeks is better if not at least acceptable. The problem is that you have to wait longer for the second dose, and therefore, full protection. [CDC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lbiqne/daily_discussion_thread_february_03_2021/glvp1nl?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) used to say that there is no maximum interval between doses, but has recently changed. [Pfizer says not more than 6 weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/liakcb/covid19_vaccine_doses_shouldnt_be_more_than_six/). 

[Dose intervals might increase efficacy if extended past 3 or 4 weeks,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/mudvjd/questin_about_vaccine_intervals/gv58byt/) CDC says you have up to 42 days between doses (but that may be extended at some point).

Did you accidentally get mixed doses? [All good.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html)

Even if your antibodies fade over time, [you still have immunity.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/npeymo/sarscov2specific_memory_b_cells_can_persist_in/)

Beyond that - not sure what exactly you expect a GP to do? Diagnose the underlying cause?? In all likelihood it's stress or diet, or a combination of both. As a GP you can advise a patient alter their diet, but most people will ignore it. Stress can be hard for a GP to spot in a short appointment, although again it's on the patient information leaflet.   


The key thing from a GP's perspective is you treat the symptoms quickly because otherwise you risk ulcers developing, and that can become serious quite quickly.  Most people are only on the medication for a month or two - THAT's not going to have any impact on vitamin deficiencies or fractures.  


Beyond that, it's down to the patient really. There are no easy answers.   


NB I suffer from GERD and I'm now permanently on H2 blockers. It wasn't diagnosed at first because my symptoms were a bit unusual, but I found antacid helped, so I requested PPI's myself and they fixed me. But the issue constantly returns despite my life being relatively stress free and eating a very healthy diet. So I've switched to H2 blockers because they're better over a long period. I've tried every type of food imaginable as the culprit, cutting out alcohol, meat, dairy, wheat, etc - no joy. I now believe it's a product of my personality which sort of runs at a high level of stress most of the time unless I'm absolutely caning it at the gym each day - so that's my ""cure"". I now do 1h of intense cardio most days. I'm still on H2 blockers, but only occasionally now, not every day....  
Now there's no way ANYBODY could have diagnosed this on my behalf! I also doubt most people would be up to doing my ""treatment"" ;)  


I was a bit peeved that the first GP I saw insisted it was migraines, despite me not having any of the main migraine symptoms, but there you go. GP's are just like everyone else. You get some excellent ones, a number of good ones, a number indifferent, and a handful of clowns.

Dehydration: when a child‚Äôs body loses too much water and salts, often because fluid losses are greater than from fluid intake)
Worsening of long-term medical problems like heart disease or asthma
Brain dysfunction such as encephalopathy
Sinus problems and ear infections

Flu seasons vary in severity, however every year children are at risk
CDC estimates that since 2010, flu-related hospitalizations among children younger than 5 years old have ranged from 7,000 to 26,000 in the United States.
While relatively rare, some children die from flu each year. Since 2004-2005, flu-related deaths in children reported to CDC during regular flu seasons have ranged from 37 to 199 deaths. (During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, 358 pediatric flu-related deaths were reported to CDC from April 2009 to September 2010.) It is noteworthy that among reported pediatric deaths, about 80% of those children were not fully vaccinated. Also of note, even though individual flu deaths in children must be reported to CDC, it is likely that not all deaths are captured and that the number of actual deaths is higher. CDC has developed statistical models that account for the underreporting of flu-related deaths in children to estimate the actual number of deaths. During 2018-2019, for example, 199 deaths in children were reported to CDC but statistical modeling suggests approximately 434 deaths may have occurred. More information about pediatric deaths since the 2004-2005 flu season is available in the interactive flu web application.""

Antibodies after mild covid-19 last for at least a year and also bind the new Delta variant  
The COMMUNITY study, investigating long-term immunity after covid-19, has now followed participants for a year and sees that the vast majority retain high levels of antibodies a year after infection. The study has examined whether the antibodies bind to the original virus as well as to several new variants, including Alpha (formerly known as B 1.117) and Delta, which are currently responsible for the spread in Sweden and Europe. The results suggest continued good protection one year after natural infection.

  
During the spring of 2020, samples were collected from more than 2,000 employees at Danderyd Hospital, where about 19 percent were shown to have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Samples were also collected from more than 100 hospitalized covid-19 patients. One year has now passed and the 12-month follow-up has been completed.

  
The study looked at a group of study participants who became ill in the spring of 2020 and who had not yet been vaccinated. In this group, immunity after natural infection has been studied over a one-year period. The results show that over 80% of those who had mild symptoms in spring 2020 still have measurable antibody levels a year later. Similar analyses have also been done in the group of patients who were hospitalised for covid-19, and there all continue to have measurable antibody levels one year after infection.  
The researchers also looked at the ability of the antibodies to bind the new virus variants, and found that they also bind the Alpha and Delta variants that now account for the majority of the spread in Sweden and Europe.

  
\- By testing study participants as regularly as every four months, we have collected unique data showing the progression over a year. In conclusion, we can say that we see a generally good antibody response one year after mild covid-19. One uncertainty in the past has been whether the immunity after natural infection by the original virus also protects against the new virus variants, such as Alpha and Delta. It is reassuring to see that the antibodies also bind these more infectious virus variants,"" says Charlotte Th√•lin, specialist physician and lead researcher of the COMMUNITY study at Danderyd Hospital.  
\- Despite this positive news, it is important that everyone continues to follow recommendations from authorities, and vaccinate themselves whether they have had covid-19 or not. We see that antibody levels in those who have previously had covid-19 increase significantly after vaccination, and we do not yet know how the levels correlate with the duration of protection,"" says Sebastian Havervall, associate senior physician at Danderyd Hospital and a PhD student in the project.

  
The COMMUNITY study continues

  
\- The COMMUNITY study is now continuing and the next sampling will take place in August/September when most participants are likely to be vaccinated. We will continue to compare the immune response after natural infection and after vaccination, and look at the immune response after different types and combinations of vaccines. The study group is unique and we will continue to follow the participants with ongoing testing in the future,' says Charlotte Th√•lin.

Fairfield is pretty small, and sends the most critical cases to Liverpool, which is the largest hospital in the Southern Hemisphere. Being small as it is, it has a very strange staff-to-patient ratio (at least it did during my time there - rumour had it that Fairfield reputedly had the highest in the state). 

Royal North Shore Hospital is in North Sydney, and is huge. I am guessing she was working a part-time job as a nursing assistant there, and doing the bulk of her university student placement block at Fairfield, which is 50km to the west/south west. 

I guess they were more focused on the COVID threat coming from patients instead of staff. 

It is strange to me that a COVID jab was not part of the compulsory immunisation schedule for nursing students (also those doing medical and allied health too). Before they even hit the wards, they all undergo checks by NSWHealth which is our state's health department.

I work in the education sector, we've had these discussions from a non political view.  There are additional considerations worth thinking about.

There are higher unvaccinated rates for lower income and BAME (non-white) people both categories that already suffer from lower achievement rates.  Black Caribbean and White Working Class Males are at the bottom of achievement tables, so we'd be penalising those most vulnerable with exclusion.

There is a legal requirement to be in education and/or training to the age of 18.  There is not a legal requirement to vaccinate.  (Slightly messy, there is no legal requirements for institutions to provide education over 16 but is for a local authority).

Often it is the parents that are anti-vax and mask, not the students.  By having them here, there is a higher chance they may decide to goto a walk-in centre to vaccinate from peer pressure, than if we exclude them.

The bit I did object to was those that didn't want to wear masks in classrooms when teachers wanted that.  Here you are infringing on one persons comfort for another.

[],,BobbleHeadBryant,,,[],,,,text,t2_ay24qt12,False,False,[],"The Democratic National Committee reportedly wants Short Message Service (SMS) carriers to step in and police private text messages as part of a new push against COVID-19 vaccine misinformation.

Allies of President Joe Biden, including the DNC, plan to ‚Äúengage fact-checkers more aggressively‚Äù and work alongside phone companies to combat misinformation about vaccines shared via social media and private SMS messages,¬†according to a Monday report from Politico.

White House officials are particularly frustrated with the¬†characterization by some Republicans¬†of their door-to-door pro-vaccination campaign, according to the report.

One example SMS message cited by Politico was sent by conservative activist group Turning Point USA, in which co-founder Charlie Kirk falsely contends that ‚ÄúBiden is sending goons DOOR-TO-DOOR to make you take a Covid-19 vaccine. Sign the petition to: No medical raids in America.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen we see deliberate efforts to spread misinformation, we view that as an impediment to the country‚Äôs public health and will not shy away from calling that out,‚Äù¬†White House¬†spokesman Kevin Munoz told Politico.

Big Tech platforms and corporate media outlets¬†have consistently cracked down¬†on alleged ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù throughout the pandemic, but in some cases, they‚Äôve censored or suppressed information that turned out to be true. Perhaps the chief example is the lab-leak theory, which hypothesizes that the pandemic originated from an accidental leak of the virus out of the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.

The¬†Biden administration¬†has blamed misinformation for contributing to vaccine hesitancy and slowing down the country‚Äôs vaccination campaign. Biden set a goal of achieving a 70% vaccination rate by July 4, but the U.S. fell just short of that benchmark.

‚ÄúThe failure to provide accurate public health information, including the efficacy of vaccines and the accessibility of them to people across the country, including South Carolina, is literally killing people, so maybe they should consider that,‚Äù White House press secretary¬†Jen Psaki¬†said last week.

Biden‚Äôs¬†door-to-door outreach plan¬†involves sending volunteer community and religious leaders to households in areas with low vaccination rates to share information about the available COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S, which are overwhelmingly safe and effective. These outreach efforts have been ongoing for several months in less-vaccinated communities.

Polling indicates¬†that many of the remaining vaccine holdouts aren‚Äôt necessarily having difficulty hearing about or accessing the shots, but simply don‚Äôt want them. Some federal officials are blaming that on politics.

‚ÄúThe big misinterpretation that Fox News or whomever else is saying is that they are essentially envisioning a bunch of federal workers knocking on your door, telling you you‚Äôve got to do something that you don‚Äôt want to do,‚Äù NIAID director¬†Dr. Anthony Fauci¬†said Sunday. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs absolutely not the case, it‚Äôs trusted messengers who are part of the community doing that ‚Äì not government officials.

To put into context how large the age-based risk of covid mortality is using more examples like the article offers; even with the majority (95%) of elderly vaccinated with highly efficacious vaccines (~95% protection against death) a typical person in 75+ year age bracket still has ~165 times higher risk of death than a typical person in the age group of 15-24 (many of whom are currently unvaccinated ) . As vaccines are rolled out more in the 15-24 age group and uptake increases the risk for this younger age group can/will decrease further, widening the disparity. 

Even more extreme comparison:  for age groups between 1-4 year old, who are of course completely unvaccinated; the risk of covid related mortality is still 9,545 (yes, 9 thousand times) lower than the risk for almost entirely fully vaccinated 75+ year old groups. 

This is not about downplaying vaccines (the overall IFR across all ages has been reduced to 0.085% with the help of them) just highlighting that even if fully immunized,  older people  especially should consider staying bit more cautious.

**Sealioning** is a harassment tactic by which a participant in a debate or online discussion pesters the other participant with disingenuous questions under the guise of sincerity, hoping to erode the patience or goodwill of the target to the point where they appear unreasonable. Often, sealioning involved asking for evidence for even basic claims. The term comes from a web comic depicting a sea lion engaging in such behavior.

Cases announced on Thursday included a Covid-positive patient who attended Liverpool hospital and a staff member at Chris O‚ÄôBrien Life House, a cancer centre in Sydney‚Äôs inner west. The latter case was picked up during routine testing of staff and further urgent testing is under way.

NSW recorded 65 new cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Wednesday, but up to 36 were out in the community while infected. The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, warned residents to expect higher numbers on Friday.

Some 28 were not isolating and seven were partially isolating. One case was still under investigation.

‚ÄúBased on the fact that we had 28 people infectious in the community in the last 24 hours, I am predicting that we will have higher case numbers tomorrow,‚Äù the premier said.

‚ÄúNow, I want to send the following strong message to the community: whilst the case numbers are bouncing around, we are seeing a stabilisation. They are not growing exponentially. That tells us that the settings that we have in place are having an impact. My strongest message to everybody is keep doing what you are doing.‚Äù

The list of the latest exposure sites includes numerous medical centres and pharmacists, mostly in south-west Sydney. Late on Thursday, an aged care home in Minchinbury in western Sydney confirmed a contract cleaner had tested positive for the virus prompting a lockdown of the facility.

A spokesperson for Minchinbury Manor said about 90% of its 134 residents had received some level of vaccination and there had been no Covid cases among them to date.

The spokesperson said the centre believed 90% of staff have been vaccinated ‚Äúand we have directed the remainder to be vaccinated urgently‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe anticipate the remaining few residents and staff, who are not vaccinated, will be offered the vaccine again in the facility following the positive case. To date, no other staff member or resident in the facility has shown a positive result,‚Äù the centre said in a statement.

At least one paramedic in south-west Sydney, believed to have been infected in the community and not at work, tested positive to the virus. More paramedics have also been diagnosed, according to media reports.

‚ÄúNSW Ambulance is investigating reports of further positive cases in paramedics who had no contact with the confirmed case. Urgent contact tracing is under way,‚Äù the service said in a statement.

At least another 70 paramedics have reportedly been forced into isolation as close contacts.

Berejiklian and the chief health officer, Kerry Chant, have urged people to get tested, but are saying to get tested at a drive-through centre rather than at their GP.

Berejiklian urged people to seek medical care but phone first ‚Äì particularly if they had symptoms of Covid.

Chant said: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go to those facilities. Get someone to go to the pharmacy from another household, or ring the pharmacy and see what can be done if you have symptoms and need paracetamol.‚Äù


Berejiklian defended the lockdown settings, saying the health advice was that they were sufficient. But she faced strident questioning over why the government was not prepared to implement more stringent restrictions or to define essential work more clearly.

Chant revealed that authorities were investigating two workplace clusters in Greenacre ‚Äì at Hanson Concrete, where there were four cases among employees, and D &amp; M Excavations and Asphalting, where there were nine.

The government has steadfastly refused to define essential work, instead leaving it to employees and employers to decide whether work can be done from home.

The construction industry is permitted to continue operating, including government projects such as Westconnex.

Despite the new cases among building suppliers, Berejiklian said the construction industry was operating because it could do so safely.

‚ÄúWe know that those organisations that are continuing work are doing so in a Covid-safe way,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut what is really important is to make sure that when we highlight work sites where there is evidence of transmission, that people sit up and notice.

‚ÄúEmployers and employees have responsibilities. Every citizen in this state has a responsibility.

‚ÄúThe reality is, a lot of businesses because of the stay-at-home orders have chosen to close. A lot of businesses that have the option to stay open or close, have chosen to close. Those employees who are at home are able to get disaster payment relief. This is important.‚Äù

The health minister, Brad Hazzard, said employers had a duty to let their employees work from home.

‚ÄúI think there has been a bit of perhaps confusion with the employers,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI have heard that some employers are telling employees they must come into the office. They think they really need them there. Well I am just going to emphasise to the employers throughout NSW: we are all in this together. Please understand there actually is a health order requiring you to allow your workers to work from home unless they really can‚Äôt.‚Äù

Berejiklian rejected suggestions that stronger restrictions were needed, saying her decisions were based on the best health advice in the nation. But she also refused to say that the measures would be effective to end the lockdown by 30 July.

‚ÄúAll we are saying is when we receive the health advice we get that health advice based on the situation at the time,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI wish I had a crystal ball to know what this situation will be in two weeks‚Äô time.‚Äù

Precise correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 are not known, but emerging variants of concern might shift immunity below a protective margin, prompting the need for updated vaccines.13 Interestingly, vaccine responses even after single dose are substantially enhanced in individuals with a history of infection with SARS-CoV-2.14 These data are all confirmation, if it were needed, that for SARS-CoV-2 the hope of protective immunity through natural infections might not be within our reach, and a global vaccination programme with high efficacy vaccines is the enduring solution.""",,,,1626309993,{},h57x8el,False,t3_ojp2n8,False,True,t1_h57wm5p,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ojp2n8/us_covid19_cases_rising_again_doubling_over_three/h57x8el/,1626476696,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Covid is as bad as it was last winter in SW MO now and local health is saying our rates are ticking up here (E MO), and expected to increase substantially as well. 99.2(?)% of cases are people who are not vaccinated I think; that's close if not exact at least...

Now to what to be done about it? Apparently nothing...

At no point will there be any state mask mandate (been that way all along), no way (at least federally led) vaccination outreach in the communities that need it will take place. On top of that, local health officials can no longer implement restrictions either. So things that helped St. Louis for instance (mask mandates, occupancy restrictions, etc) in the earlier part of the pandemic (that the state never did) will no longer be possible as they were before.

So why should you, in a region far enough away (I assume, and just as an example) have to suffer with federal restrictions for the irresponsible behavior of people here? I know it's a virus so really it's all our issue - but restrictions on things like occupancy, masks or travel ability really should be tailored to the area needed. Not used as a general method of spread control at this point - unless/until a general wide spread issue comes along.

If 70% of people in SW Missouri want to roll the dice this Summer &amp; Fall with covid - there isn't anything anyone can do about it. That sucks, but its fucking reality.  At least every one of them that survives will have some level of immunity counting towards the total. 

They may not die and may just be sick for months/years, or they may go broke over medical bills, they may infect some unfortunate person who then in turn dies, they may grind their hospitals to a crawl, causing suffering by those who would otherwise have had access to care... But unless you want to hold every one of them down a jab them forcibly; the only thing to be done about it is let it happen and hope they don't cause a new variant.

What exactly makes that ‚Äúsome of the best data‚Äù when compared against the backdrop of large numbers of studies that have found far higher levels of protection? The Danish study is extremely short, does not mention or measure cycle counts, symptoms, disease severity, time since previous infection, seropositivity, or any other relevant or useful data that other papers have. It does not make mention of the median time to ‚Äúreinfection‚Äù, which is important because [research has found patterns consistent with RNA shedding](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2776810) which actually causes a recently infected person to be almost three times as likely to test positive on PCR when compared to someone who wasn‚Äôt recently infected, and the ratios are as such: At 0 to 30 days, the ratio was 2.85. From 31 to 60 days, it was 0.74, dropping to 0.29 at 61 to 90 days, and finally to 0.10 at more than 90 days.

They conclude:

&gt; In this cohort study, patients with positive antibody test results were initially more likely to have positive NAAT results, consistent with prolonged RNA shedding, but became markedly less likely to have positive NAAT results over time

I‚Äôve linked several papers but there are even more. I am curious at to why this Danish study is apparently ‚Äúsome of the best data‚Äù given that other studies broke down reinfections by symptoms (consistently leading to very high protection against symptomatic reinfection, and lower against asymptomatic), duration since previous infection, some report cycle counts, etc. I have not seen a study this short - the entire full text of the Danish study fits on one page - so there is very very little way to assess it‚Äôs methodology, shortcomings, etc.",,,,1626309669,{},h57wm5p,False,t3_ojp2n8,False,True,t1_h57ty2j,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ojp2n8/us_covid19_cases_rising_again_doubling_over_three/h57wm5p/,1626476346,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I think what makes that hard is how tough it is to draw the line between someone with legitimate concerns or a different opinion and someone being malicious.

I wish that our rates were higher, and I'm having to avoid being around certain friends who haven't been vaccinated because despite being fully vaccinated, I was immunosuppressed when I was vaccinated, and I'm still immunosupressed, meaning that the vaccine efficacy is most likely lower for me. Given the immunosuppressant I'm taking, studies found a 10-fold decrease in antibody production from the vaccines, but they're unsure how much (if at all) that affects protection. So, given that I'm in a very high risk group if I *were* to become infected, and my chance of becoming infected despite having been vaccinated is likely higher than an average person who received the same vaccination, it makes sense that I'm taking steps to ensure my safety. Unfortunately, a few of my friends still think that getting poked in the arm twice and feeling sick for *a single day* is too much an inconvenience for them to help protect me and others when around them. Or perhaps some of them believe in the conspiracy BS, but either way, I'm not going to risk my own health to see people that don't care enough about protecting others to get vaccinated. We have a surplus of vaccines available, so there really is no valid reason (except for rare medical issues) for people here to be avoiding vaccination.

But is it an actual problem yet?  Are appointments now impossible to find?  That's the question.  You want to talk about ""showing hard data,"" but like, you haven't actually shown that getting an appointment is borderline impossible.  See below, but it seems we are on Day 2 of record setting appointment numbers, so that would lead me to believe that appointments are still available.  Otherwise they would have tapered off due to lack of availability.

&gt;I am showing you hard data and you're replying with semantics. Logic games have no place here.

Actually they have every place here.  You made the statement that ""Getting a test will be a massive disruption for unvaccinated people, **even though many of them didn't even have the luxury to refuse being vaccinated.**""  But there exists a VERY plausible scenario in which everyone has a chance to get vaccinated even with not enough doses for everyone.  I mean, shit, it's been open to everyone for two months and vaccination rates were crawling along until this announcement.

We're three comments in and you're still insisting that you need 55M vaccines in order 

&gt;A public health policy based on not caring at all that people will not chose what's best for them

Uhh... define the word ""caring"" because this policy seems to very much care that people won't choose what's best for them and as such they need a good push to do it.  US policy on vaccines doesn't care that people won't choose what is best for them and as such we're basically stuck at where we are and it's a very slow crawl from here.

&gt; forcing them instead of convincing them is ineffective and dangerous.

So you and I just read different articles then?

They just set a record number of appointments.  Clearly it's effective at getting people to get vaccinations.  [This chart is all anyone needs to see how effective this policy is](https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/591/90/sites/default/files/20210717_WOC850.png)

&gt;This is going to breed antivaxers for years to come.

My honest opinion:  And so?  So they go from 2% to 3% of the population. (True anti-vaxxer numbers.  Like those that refuse MMR and DTaP.  Not just the COVID vaccine hesitant and those that are too lazy or busy to go get it done promptly)  Big whoop.  They're still an insignificant portion and since you've got them all separated from society or vaccinated, the damage they deal is GREATLY reduced.

Additionally, underscoring this entire thing is that nothing is set in stone.  The French government can move out the October 3rd date.  They can move out the July 21 date.   If France gets to a point where there is an availability gap come October 3rd, they can pivot.  But the bottom line is: Just because they are going to be 10M doses short doesn't mean there will actually be an availability gap.

I, mean, shit, how much of that gap gets covered by saying ""If you've started your vaccinations, we will cover your PCR tests past October 3rd.""  The imgur link (from the reddit post above) has been deleted, but given the various wait times including 11 weeks to be fully vaccinated following initiating the AZ vaccine, I'm guessing that policy change would cover a big portion of the gap.",,,,1626364521,{},h5adnps,False,t3_okcw6v,False,True,t1_h5a75gy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/okcw6v/french_citizens_rush_to_book_vaccines_after/h5adnps/,1626523158,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Following his positive test result, the city‚Äôs Police Department ordered mass testing among all staff at the prison and later, among several inmates.

By July 5, 44 more staff and 36 prisoners have been confirmed positive, according to the city's Health Department.

He died later that day and tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

That inmate lives in HCMC‚Äôs District 1 and was taken to the prison on May 12.

On Tuesday night, it appeared that a riot broke out at the prison during a medical checkup, with shots and screams being heard.

HCMC police are looking for a 27-year-old death row convict infected with the Covid-19 virus who has escaped from the prison.  
Nguyen Kim An was sentenced to death for robbery and murder in September 2015, a police spokesperson said Thursday.  
  
""He's 1.63 meters tall with short hair, fair skin and carries a limp due to an injury,"" the spokesperson said, not revealing any details about the escape.  
  
In 2014, An lost his motorbike and computer, so he decided to poison one of his friends from school and steal his belongings.  
  
On February 25, 2014, An bought five sleeping pills and invited his friend, Dat, to a cafe. He spiked a drink with the pills, but it wasn't enough to knock the friend out. The next day, he bought a stronger drug and invited the friend to his apartment in Tan Binh District.  
  
This time, the spiked drink caused Dat to have a seizure. An then strangled Dat till he stopped moving. He took Dat‚Äôs iPhone, put his body into a bag and dumped it into the river from the Phu My Bridge in District 2.  
  
An then contacted the family, informed them that Dat had been kidnapped and demanded VND500 million as ransom. After a few days of pressing the family to pay, he stopped.

An was jailed at the Chi Hoa Prison in District 10, where at least 81 Covid-19 cases were detected among inmates and staff early this month.

I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre spreading an anti-vax rumor

&gt;Rumor: Do vaccines cost money? Can they be purchased online?

&gt;Fact: The federal government is providing the vaccine free of charge to people living in the United States.

&gt;However, your vaccination provider may bill your insurance company, Medicaid or Medicare for an administration fee. 

&gt;You cannot buy vaccines online.

&gt;You should not pay someone to put your name on a list to get the vaccine. You shouldn‚Äôt trust anyone who offers to help and then asks for money or personal information. COVID-19 vaccines are available only at established vaccination centers and must be given by trained medical professionals. Visit the CDC Coronavirus page for recommendations for who should get vaccinated first.

I‚Äôm not by any means anti-vaccine and I think the covid vaccine has had a tremendous impact on our fight against this virus. I also believe humans have the right to ask questions and understand what is going into their body before they choose to receive it. 

This militant aggression towards anyone hesitant to receive a vaccine, and snubbing any story (even the true ones) about negative side effects, has been painfully counterproductive.

&amp;#x200B;

  
Why do so many people refuse to get vaccinated?  Fear, stronger than religion or level of education 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  
Some have decided to overcome fear because of a greater threat, such as the disease, others consider the injection the greatest danger, especially if they have survived the infection.  
In Romania, after 1990, there was no vaccination campaign that exceeded three million immunized people . Only in 2009 was this figure reached, when the Cantacuzino Institute was operational and produced a large number of doses of influenza vaccine.

&amp;#x200B;

  
So far, in Romania, almost 4.8 million people have been immunized against the Covid-19 epidemic .  


&amp;#x200B;

  
A study conducted in the US in 2008 shows that ""19% of adults did not get the TB vaccine and 20% did not get the tetanus vaccine because of the fear of injection.""  
Fear and needle phobia are challenges that the medical system has always faced.  
""The fear of needles occurs frequently in the population around the world, with a higher prevalence in children, adolescents and women. The fear of needles is common in patients who need preventive care‚Ä¶ "", concludes the cited study.

&amp;#x200B;

  
With the pandemic and the advent of vaccines, the authorities tried to persuade the population to get vaccinated, leaving the decision to the individual, but the success was limited.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
I don't trust the vaccine  
In Romania, so far, a quarter of the population has been vaccinated with at least one dose, being far from the coverage needed to achieve group immunity.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
Ionela, a member of the local police in Provi»õa de Sus, says she would be vaccinated if it were mandatory - Photo: Alexandru Nistor / SpotMedia.ro  
""I refuse to get my injection because I don't trust the vaccine,"" said Ionela, 38, one of three local police officers in Provi»õa de Sus commune, Prahova county.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
In the locality, out of the 2,000 inhabitants, 500 are vaccinated, according to the mayor's statements, confirmed by the family doctor.  
""She appeared too quickly,"" adds the policewoman, a strong, tall woman with long black hair caught in a tail at the back.  
During the state of emergency, Ionela helped people in the community with shopping, prescriptions and everything else needed.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
She knows what impact the virus had on the commune where, at the beginning of July, there were two more cases of infected people.  
""The main reason I don't trust the vaccine is that it came up too quickly,"" she said, using a common argument in people who refuse to get vaccinated.  
Mandatory vaccination, an important argument  
Asked what could cause her to be vaccinated, Ionela said that ‚Äúshe would be vaccinated only if the injection was mandatory. I wouldn't want to lose my job. I really like what I do "", she added.  
The mayor of the commune, Ovidiu Ioan Movileanu, 63, is the direct head of the three local police officers, but he does not want to force his subordinate to get vaccinated.

""She is a good and hardworking girl. I keep beating her head, but she doesn't want peace. I have nothing to do with them "", he says.  
The mayor was vaccinated, but was also infected with Covid-19.  
""I didn't realize I was sick only when I saw that I lost three kilograms,"" he says.   
""I went and took my test. I got vaccinated as soon as I could and I try to convince as many people as possible to get vaccinated "", he added.

If you are a foreign national from a country outside the EU/EEA

There is a ban on non-essential travel to Sweden from countries outside the EU/EEA. The ban applies to foreign nationals from countries outside the EU/EEA and will remain in effect until 31 August 2021. Certain individuals who have particularly urgent needs or who are going to carry out essential services in Sweden may be exempt.
Foreign nationals who fulfil the requirements for an exemption are advised to get tested for Covid-19 when they arrive in Sweden and five days after their arrival. They should also self-isolate for one week after arriving in Sweden. 

A number of countries are exempt from the entry ban. The decisive factor is whether you live in one of the countries, not if you are a citizen. Travellers to Sweden should therefore be prepared to provide documentation showing that they live in one of the aforementioned countries in order to be granted entry.
Exempted travellers need to show results from a negative Covid-19 test no more than 48 hours old before entry.
Currently exempt countries: Australia, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Israel, Japan. In addition, from 30 June 2021, those living in one of the following countries will also be allowed to enter Sweden: Albania, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Macao, North Macedonia, Serbia, Taiwan, and the USA.

Foreign nationals from countries outside the EU/EEA can enter Sweden from EU/EEA countries if they can present a certificate proving a negative Covid-19 test no more than 48 hours old.

Also you should define your numbers (I‚Äôm guessing CFR means Case Fatality Rate) and realize that one very specific metric does not tell the whole story. 
The nature of this virus doesn‚Äôt show for at least a couple weeks but judging how long it takes to get peddled by the media, it‚Äôs more like a month for regular people like yourself. 

So while it is true the CFR was very low for the first few iterations of this virus, that could quickly change and you wouldn‚Äôt realize it until it was too late. 
I liken it to people who say they could afford to go to school on their part-time job‚Äîit was true in the mid 1900‚Äôs but is a laughable/shocking notion today. 

And the CFR only tells one very specific result, it does not predict the future and it may or may not apply to the next iterations. Now you could help prevent further iterations of the virus by WEARING A MASK but I am guessing (*since you like misuse of numbers to justify your heartlessness*) you don‚Äôt want to do that either.

And it might be that the CFR remains low, but there are other effects to consider. There are other symptoms, like covid toes, that can arise *and fundamentally affect their development in ways we do not know* and cause them lifelong problems. 

Anyways, as a long-time user of math it really grinds my gears to see such flagrant math-abuse. It‚Äôs not a tool to justify your heartlessness, there are children‚Äôs lives behind that statistic. How many dead kids are you comfortable with? 1? 2? 100?

Viruses are classified much like living organisms.  They have phyla, classes, orders, genera, and species.  So for coronaviruses, here is the phylogeny:

* Order: *Nidovirales*
* Suborder: *Coronavirineaea*
   * Family: *Coronaviridae*
   * Subfamily: *Orthocoronaviridae*
      * And then there are four genera and those genera are called --yup-- *Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus,* and *Deltacoronavirus.*

Although lets look at my track record so far.

I graduated from high school in the very early 1990s.  I said the U.S. had it's pants around its knees and is going to get hit by an enemy attack. Partially because the intelligence agencies weren't talking to each other, partially of the arrogance of the people of the U.S. believing it couldn't happen and partially because of how the U.S. treats other countries.  I figured mid to late 1990s for us to get nailed, 9/11 happened in 2001. Ok I was a little off.

Very late 1990s I said unless the country (U.S.) starts to work together the country is going to become so fractured that there may not be a way to put it back together and we would wind up with a tyrannical leader if not a full on dictator. I said it would take 15 - 20 years for it to happen.  Trump got elected in 2016.  The country is now so fractured that half the country would rather believe obvious lies then admit that the other side might be right.

When  covid started the health officials said unless we do something we were looking at 250,000 dead by the the end of 2020.  I said no, we are looking at 500,000 dead by the end of 2020 because people are to stupid, self centered and arrogant to do what is right (wearing a mask and social distancing).  What  happened? People went to the beach. People went to spring break. People insisted on gathering in large groups.  Ok I was off by little bit, it took until Feb. 22nd of 2021 to hit 500,000 dead in the U.S.  

Usually as a virus becomes more deadly people will die faster, so the virus can't spread as far. The word here is usually, there are exceptions to every rule. I think we might be looking at an exception if this thing keeps mutating, and it will keep mutating because of the idiocy of society.  We have the ability to travel from one side of the world to the other in less then 20 hours.  How fast can a deadly virus spread if people are to stupid and arrogant to do what they should be doing?",,,,1626382583,{},h5bjkkk,False,t3_okwail,False,True,t1_h5bb7ck,/r/Coronavirus/comments/okwail/french_police_fire_tear_gas_as_antivaccine/h5bjkkk/,1626547171,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

1) The science and principles between Sputnik V are excellent and while I know there is some suspicion about the results, given the mechanism of action, it's not at all surprising.  They use two different adenoviruses at the same dose as the J&amp;J/Janssen vaccine (10^(11) particles), one of which is the same Adenovirus 26 strain that J&amp;J uses and the other is Adenovirus 5, which gets around the issue of the first dose causing neutralizing antibodies that block the second.  Based on this, I think the reported efficacy is likely very realistic and I would have been willing to take this vaccine.

2) Russia has engaged in an extensive antivaccine disinformation program since well before COVID-19.  Most recently, this disinformation program has been aimed at the Western vaccines, J&amp;J/Janssen, BNT/Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZenica/Oxford.  They have maligned mRNA vaccines as unsafe introduction of genetic material into cells (even though Adenovirus-vectored vaccines, including their own, **actually introduce foreign DNA into the cell nucleus**).  They maligned AstraZenica as a ""Monkey vaccine using a monkey virus.""  I don't know what they've done against J&amp;J/Janssen because it's so similar to their own product.

I know people say anti-vaxxers are ""selfish"" but I swear my wife is the most kind, thoughtful, sweet woman I've met in my wife. Everyone who is around her loves her, she is nice to everyone and she is an amazing person. 

However, she *is* an anti-vaxxer and believes a bunch of half-baked conspiracy theories and it is absolutely maddening. It all started years ago when her and her side of the family would spend hours and hours on Youtube watching videos thinking they uncovered some huge conspiracy.  What's crazy about it is her sisters both married men who are like-minded to them so I feel like this huge outcast in the family because I do not share these same views (and many of the religious views as well). At least two of my nieces on her side are completely unvaccinated since birth and while I find that insane, they are not my children, so I do not say anything about it.

I was fully vaxxed (Pfizer) about three months ago. I hoped that if she saw me do it and have no issues, it may change her mind, but all she has done now is pivot to long-term effects and how we don't know what they will be. She even works for the school system and works closely with special needs children and that is not enough to get her to change her mind which infuriates me. In fact, she told me if the school system requires her to get vaccinated, she will just immediately quit. While we are not poor, we are about as middle-class as they come and her just up and quitting a job could potentially be devastating.

We have four children and two of our boys (15 and 13) are eligible to get vaccinated. I have been torn on what to do the past few months, but I am terribly concerned not only for her but for them too and society as a whole. I've tried to bring it up here and there but it always turns into a huge argument. 

Well I finally decided last night that I cannot control what she does, but that my sons are getting vaccinated. Believe me, I've tried the ""ask her"" approach many times and got shot down, so I flat-out told her today that I am taking them to get it done whether she agrees with me or not. Of course, this started an all-out war in my house. 

She is saying that I cannot do this without her consent legally and threatening to call the cops or CPS if I do it, in which I stated, ""I think you are the one that would be in trouble more so than me."" which set her off more. She is acting like this is some sort of deal-breaker in our almost 20-year relationship.

The general immunology knowledge is that the high level of antibodies, especially if it binds to the virus, will confer a good immunity level. Otherwise, our previous knowledge of immunity would be useless and there is no point in measuring antibody level, ever.

Oh, and it's administrative - so you can't challenge it, either - giving you a real financial incentive to actually get that vaccine.

And that's already the case for polio, TB and measles vaccine here, along with several other ones. 

The whole ""let's inconvenience people into compliance"" thing is - as you said - the way to get around the issue. And I'm expecting it won't work in the long run.

Call me a pessimist, but I've already seen protests over festivals and concerts admitting only vaccinated people, as well as backtracking.
