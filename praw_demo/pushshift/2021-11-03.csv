Estimation station

Our next step was to feed all of these numbers into a machine-learning algorithm called a ‚Äúgradient booster‚Äù, in order to determine which combinations of our variables yielded the most accurate estimates of excess deaths per 100,000 people. This method makes predictions based on a series of ‚Äúdecision trees‚Äù. For instance, one tree might first check if test positivity rates are above or below a given threshold, and then ask whether the number of tests per person exceeds a different cut-off. It might find that if both figures are greater than these benchmarks, excess deaths tend to be higher than the model expected before asking those questions. It thus adjusts its prediction incrementally upwards. The algorithm constructs thousands of these trees, each one detecting new patterns that improve the forecasts generated by the ‚Äúforest‚Äù of all previous ones.

To assess whether our model‚Äôs estimates were accurate, we split up our data into ten chunks. One by one, we set aside a single chunk, trained our algorithm on the remaining nine-tenths of the data, and asked the model to make a prediction of excess deaths for the countries we did not allow it to see. If the model did a good job of estimating mortality in places for which we knew the real number but it did not, we reasoned that it would fare similarly well at making predictions for countries where no one knows the true value.

Our model was far from perfect. In some cases, its best guess of the number of excess deaths in a given country in a given week was far too high; others were far too low. Overall, however, the model was reasonably well-calibrated. Given 100 different examples of combinations of countries and weeks where its predictions were between, say, 0.45 and 0.55 excess deaths per 100,000 people, some might actually have been as low as -0.1 and others might in fact have been as high as 1.5. However, the average of all 100 cases was generally close to 0.5. The same was true for other levels of predicted excess deaths, such as those between -0.2 and -0.1 per 100,000, or between 0.75 and 0.85.

Our algorithm struggled most at the very peak of the direst outbreaks. In the small handful of cases where it estimated horrifying weekly tolls above three excess deaths per 100,000 people, the real numbers clustered between two and three. (You can see this pattern at the top right of the chart above, where the red line, representing the best-fitting trend between predicted and actual data, dips below the black 45-degree line that represents a perfectly calibrated model.) However, such severe cases are so rare that they barely influence our total global estimate. For example, the model‚Äôs current estimate for the out-of-control outbreak ravaging India is still below 1.5 excess deaths per 100,000 people per week, putting that country comfortably within the range in which its forecasts are generally on target.
Believe it or not

Our algorithm produces only a single best guess, or ‚Äúpoint estimate‚Äù, for each country in each week. However, such central estimates may be of little value if they sit near the middle of vast ranges of uncertainty. As one example commonly cited in statistics classes illustrates, picture a poor student given two buckets of water, one near boiling, the other near freezing. His best guess for the temperature was, correctly, a comfortable 50¬∞ C. However, failing to appreciate the importance of the variation surrounding that estimate, he put one foot in each.

To avoid such pitfalls, our final step was to calculate the ranges within which the model suggested the true answer would lie, with varying degrees of certainty. We used a method called ‚Äúbootstrapping‚Äù. Rather than merely using our full dataset to produce a single model, we created 100 artificial datasets of the same size, first by picking countries at random, and then similarly by selecting weeks of data at random for each chosen country. After a country or week was chosen, we did not remove it but instead left it in place. As a result, each individual artificial dataset contains many copies of certain country-week pairs, whereas others are absent entirely.

Next, we trained a different gradient-boosting model on each of these simulated datasets. Each model contains a different set of decision trees that reflect different patterns and relationships between variables, reflecting the idiosyncrasies of the specific artificial dataset used to create it. In turn, each model yields a slightly different prediction for every single country-week combination. For each excess-death total we publish, we use the model trained on the actual, complete dataset as our central estimate, and then the middle 95 or 50 of the predictions generated by the 100 other models as our confidence intervals. These bounds reflect the ranges within which the models suggest that the true value should lie, with 95% or 50% certainty.
Combining it all

Our final step was to combine these estimates with published data on excess deaths. For any week in any country where a true number of excess deaths is reported, we simply use the known value; for those where one is missing, we fill in our estimate instead. For some countries, such as India, we had to use the model‚Äôs prediction for every week; in others, such as America, we only needed to estimate the most recent week.

This process is illustrated in the chart below, showing data from Egypt. To an extent, our estimates move up and down over time in the same direction as officially recorded covid-19 deaths. However, the relationship between official and estimated deaths itself varies. During periods when recorded outbreaks were worse, our model reckoned that undercounting was more severe as well (as suggested by available data).

By adding up known and estimated totals for every country in every week, we can compute an estimated global total of excess deaths due to the pandemic, and uncertainty ranges that reflect the precision of those estimates. To read the model‚Äôs conclusions, and what the results imply, please see our Briefing. Interested readers can also explore the model themselves: we provide complete replication code with annotations and data at our dedicated GitHub repository.

Covid-19 death tallies

How we estimated the true death toll of the pandemic
Dealing with potential outcomes, known unknowns, and uncertainty

ACADEMIC RESEARCH often seeks to answer counter-factual questions. What would have happened if a drug had been administered earlier to someone suffering from a disease? What if wealth were distributed more equally than it is? What would have occurred if a revolution that failed had instead succeeded‚Äîor if a successful one had failed? Even in quantum physics, we cannot observe something both happening and not: as soon as we open the box containing Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs cat, the animal is either alive or dead. Yet any time scholars make causal claims, they are implicitly estimating the results of a comparison between what actually occurred and what might have, but didn‚Äôt.

The covid-19 pandemic has changed the world in innumerable ways, but its most immediate and tragic consequence has been the loss of life. Just as with countless other research topics, calculating a full account of the disease‚Äôs human toll requires estimating the answer to a counter-factual question. How many more people have died than the number who would still have perished if SARS-CoV-2 had never emerged?
Why not just count them?

The answer to this question is measured using ‚Äúexcess mortality‚Äù, which is the gap between the total number of deaths that occur for any reason and the amount that would be expected under normal circumstances. Excess mortality caused by the pandemic is probably smaller than covid-19‚Äôs total effect on the world‚Äôs population: the reduction in the number of babies born during the pandemic could well exceed the net increase in deaths. However, it is much more comprehensive than official statistics on how many people have been killed by the disease.

Public-health authorities classify anyone who dies within weeks of a positive covid-19 test as a covid-19 death. In some cases, this method can lead to over-counting: some people, particularly ones who are extremely old or suffer from other severe ailments, would have died anyway between the time they were infected and the present. More often, however, this approach leads to underestimates. Lots of people who would still be alive today had they not been infected with covid-19 do not show up in official figures, because they succumbed to the disease without being tested for it.

In addition, the pandemic has had indirect effects on death rates. Many people with treatable medical conditions have died because they did not receive appropriate health care. Conversely, other people have survived who, were it not for the behavioural changes induced by covid-19, would have died from causes like influenza, air pollution or car accidents.

These effects can be quite large, and vary from country to country in both size and direction. According to the most recent data, excess deaths in America are 7% higher than its official covid-19 deaths. In contrast, excess mortality is 21% below the publicly reported toll from covid-19 in Britain, and 20% lower in France. Places that have had extremely mild pandemics, such as Australia, Norway, and Taiwan, actually have deficit rather than excess deaths, meaning that fewer people have died overall than the average in previous years.

In middle-income and especially poor countries, which conduct less testing for covid-19 than rich ones do, excess mortality almost always exceeds the official death toll, often by large margins. For example, in Romania, Iran, South Africa and Mexico, excess deaths are more than double those officially attributed to covid-19. Moreover, these multipliers vary over time. During the course of the pandemic, some countries have improved their ability to count deaths accurately. Others, particularly those facing severe outbreaks, got worse.
Known unknowns

Data on excess deaths are available for dozens of countries, and many places update them frequently. In these mostly rich parts of the world, we have a reliable measure of the pandemic‚Äôs true toll. However, other countries report total death numbers only with long lags, and a surprisingly large number do not publish them at all. Such places also tend to do relatively little testing for covid-19, meaning that their official death counts capture just a small share of the disease‚Äôs true impact. A large majority of the world‚Äôs population lives in regions, including India, China and most of Africa, where data on excess deaths are heavily delayed or entirely unavailable.

The only way to fill in these continent-sized gaps in the data is to estimate them. Fortunately, lots of other statistics about these countries are available, which can be used to make highly educated guesses. Virtually all countries publish official counts of covid-19 cases and deaths, which can serve as a starting point. Most countries also report the share of their covid-19 tests that are positive, which can be used to estimate the magnitude of under-counting of cases. In some places, seroprevalence surveys offer estimates of the share of the population that has detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, which is a measure of past infection. Other indicators may matter as well, such as the steps governments have taken to curb the pandemic; the extent to which people move around physically; systems of government; media freedom; demography; and geographic location. In cases where countries do not publish some of these data, their absence is useful information in and of itself.
Collect and connect

To estimate excess deaths wherever and whenever data are unavailable‚Äîwhich in some places is the entirety of the pandemic, and in others only particular time periods‚ÄîThe Economist gathered all of the relevant information we could find about each country (a full list of sources and categories is provided below). In total, we used 121 different indicators, and produced estimates for over 200 distinct countries and territories. Of these statistics, about half were constant over time (an example is demography, where we used population estimates from 2019) and half varied by day (the number of diagnosed covid-19 cases, or the extent to which people moved around according to their mobile phones). These numbers were unavailable for many countries. To improve predictions in such places, we calculated weighted averages obtained from neighbouring, nearby or similar countries for each variable that was missing. And to avoid distortions caused by the specific day of the week on which data are reported, we aggregated daily numbers into weekly averages.

After amassing all of these predictors, we lined them up with data on excess deaths, which we have been collecting for more than a year. Our tracker has numbers for 78 countries, drawing heavily from the Human Mortality Database and World Mortality Dataset. In addition, for this exercise, we made an extra effort to obtain at least partial data about countries with especially large populations, which weigh heavily in any estimate of the global total. Using the supplemental appendix of an article in the British Journal of Medicine, we were able to calculate 12 weeks of data on excess deaths in China from the Chinese Centres for Disease Control (which did not respond to our requests). For India, we could only identify reliable data for the city of Mumbai. Rather than assuming that this one region is representative of all of India, we had our models treat Mumbai as a separate country, from which it could learn patterns to apply elsewhere, in India and beyond. In order to strike a balance between information obtained from big countries and small ones, we weighted data from each country by the logarithm of its population. This meant that our eventual model would assign much more importance to Mexico than to Monaco, without ignoring the latter entirely.",,,,1635987789,{},hj85044,False,t3_qm1emq,False,True,t1_hj7ydse,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qm1emq/according_to_the_economist_estimates_the_number/hj85044/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,091236f60c5e37048c08850db825a76f5f024121,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1635987803.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Or what are you trying to say? Because then people were lied to when they were said vaccines are the solution. Well, if there will be more restrictions and lockdowns then there is clearly something wrong with the vaccine statement. And yeah, I‚Äôm doublevaxxed btw.

Not for now, and that is because what the vaccine only does is reducing the chances of dying if you catch COVID, not preventing the illness. However, there will be a point in the future, maybe 12 or 24 more months from now, when cases still pop up but deaths will reduce from thousands per day to tenths or even less than ten, but that's going to require that about 90% of the world population to have either taken the vaccine or having caught COVID. There will be an amount of immunity. Pandemics eventually end.

Just hold to the measures a bit longer my friend. Trust me, even if I'm sick of weating my mask I'm in pro of masking if that means we can lower the cases, which will give pharmaceutical companies enough time to develop a successful treatment that will further lower the deaths/hospitalizations/or even the chances of getting long COVID.

Cases will still rise and lower, and that's what going to happen for the coming years, if not forever, but what health authorities will eventually look are not cases but hospitalizations. There are two ways this pandemic will end:

* COVID keeps being transmissible (or even rises its transmisibility) but it becomes less deadly.
* COVID becomes much deadlier but less transmissible.

Whatever one happens is not up to the virus, but us. Scientists have stated that the virus will likely stay forever, which means it's up to us, the governments, and health authorities to make it more manageable.

During that time period, WWI (the war to end all wars, the great war, etc...) was raging.      
Combatant nations were unwilling to talk about how the flu was ravaging their armed forces  or countries as a matter of national security and for moral.   They didn't want to give ""the enemy"" any information that could show a potential weakness  since neither side knew the extent that the other side was being impacted by the disease.         
Spain was not a combatant. They were one of the few countries to remain neutral. So they were more open about it.  Everybody read about it from Spanish news sources so it became known as the ""Spanish Flu"".  Spain figured it came from France and they called it the ""French Flu""         
Nobody knows with certainty where it started, but the massive movement of troops during the war and the crowded conditions for soldiers in camps and ship spread the flu. Soldiers would board troop ships healthy and die on the voyage.

&gt;***27 August (diary entry; 1 day after setting sail from Freetown, Sierra Leone):***       
        
&gt;*Fairly warm and showers of rain occasionally. An epidemic of influenza seems to have broken out on board. Sixty odd on this morning‚Äôs sick parade and 24 admissions to the hospital. Have caught it myself of course but so far am able to get about &amp; think I will hang out all right but feel very crook. Saw a few porpoises quite near the boat today. We are still travelling in the same formation but the distances from each boat varies. No band this morning, as a lot of the members are not well. This afternoon we pasted some music on to cards instead of practicing. This morning we had a lecture for half an hour on transport etc in England and was a most idiotic lecture too. Had no object in it that I could see.*       
         
&gt;***2 September (diary entry; part of military convoy off the coast of Western Africa):***    
         
&gt;*Fine day and sea like glass. Quite a gloom was cast round the cabin as soon as we were up when three deaths were reported on board. The burials took place at 11am and there were 4 burials. The Colonel read the service and it was quite a touching scene. This afternoon two more burials took place and there is another death. The other ships are also busy with burials. One of the deaths is our Clarionette player in the band and a beautiful player he was too. The strange thing about this sickness is that the big strong men seem to get it the worst and are the ones that die. One of the deaths is namesake of myself I hear. Today was mess orderly again. Was also able to eat a bit today and feel much better.*          
          
&gt;***10 September (diary entry; arriving in England):***
       
&gt;*Fine but very cold &amp; sea fair.

Good news, it seems that all the corona precautions seemed to work well against other flu-like infections:

https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/10/flu-season-winter-america-choice/620373/

&gt; Except that this past year, things were different: During the 2020‚Äì21 flu season, the United States recorded only about 2,000 cases, 17,000 times fewer than the 35 million it recorded the season before. That season, the flu killed 199 children; this past season, as far as we know, it killed one.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve looked for flu in communities and doctors‚Äô offices and hospitals, and we‚Äôve gotten almost zero,‚Äù says Emily Martin, a University of Michigan epidemiologist who‚Äôs part of the CDC‚Äôs flu-monitoring network. The same was true of other seasonal respiratory viruses last winter, says Saskia Popescu, an epidemiologist at George Mason University in Virginia, though some have since rebounded. RSV, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, adenovirus‚Äîfor a while, they all but vanished.

If we normalise some of these (staying clean, distance when possible, masks when you are sick, more people getting vaccinated) then we could reduce the overall number of infection for these type of viruses (to some degree) even without lockdowns.",,,,1636012641,{},hj99w09,False,t3_qm1emq,False,False,t1_hj8sjqs,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qm1emq/according_to_the_economist_estimates_the_number/hj99w09/,1636242860.0,39,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I finally had insurance again (thanks to my grandparents lending me a ton of money) in October I wanted to get vaccinated by one of the mobile vax teams, but they require an ID, and mine, of course, lost validity Sep 1st and I didn't have a doctor to go to yet, since I just moved because of a job. Getting a new ID is also hard, because I am obviously working now and have barely any time to go the registration office and it would take weeks to receive my new ID as well.

It really was not that I didn't want to get vaccinated, but when I could, because I was still insured and still had a doctor, the vaccines were still restricted to the risk groups and elderly, which I am not a part of. I am scared as hell of covid, especially long covid, at my young age I already have 1 crippling chronic condition that will be with me until the day I die, I definitely do not want any more from long covid.

My whole story probably sounds like a load of bullshit excuses, but this really did happen (simplified), obviously my circumstances are very unique, but I am trying my best to get vaxxed asap.

China is like light-years ahead in consumer technology. Restaurants can operate under lockdown with no issues because everyone is already used to ordering online and having stuff delivered.

The ability to have the population confident about going out is what's more important. The entire country was fully opened for a year and a half and only interrupted by short local lockdowns. Contrast this to other countries that have places perpetually operating at reduced capacity.

It's MUCH better to have a zero-covid policy and a country fully opened 95% of the time, then do a hard localized lockdown, and then fully reopen again, than to perpetually be 60% open and ""living with COVID"".

While the risk is slightly higher with Moderna, first of all that data comes from full doses and boosters are only half doses, which will almost certainly make it less common, then second, you have to weigh that against the reduced protection since covid is more likely to cause it (and other, far more serious problems). The protection benefit is likely reduced by the half dose as well, but it's still 2/3rds higher than Pfizer. The benefit will likely appear in the durability, rather than initial effectiveness.

And it's important to note... the risk has been blown quite out of proportion by the media. It's extremely rare, most of the cases are mild, and it hasn't been linked to any deaths. So while yes existing cardiovascular conditions could be worsened by it (for the period you have it), it's very unlikely to begin with and has to be weighed against the totality of benefits... countries that have suspended it haven't conducted such an analysis, they're assuming Pfizer and Moderna are equal when we know they aren't (although that is questionable on boosters).",,,,1636030884,{},hj9z0ww,False,t3_qmeyn0,False,True,t1_hj9wx5r,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qmeyn0/daily_discussion_thread_november_04_2021/hj9z0ww/,1636256563.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;The national coronavirus task force on Thursday said 1,195 people died of COVID-19 over the past day, exceeding the 1,189 recorded the previous day. Since late September, Russia has tallied new highs in infections or deaths almost daily.

3rd wave really never ended. [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/russia/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/russia/)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Less than 35% of Russia‚Äôs nearly 146 million people have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, even though Russia approved a domestically developed vaccine against the coronavirus months before most countries.

Still lagging in fully vaccinated.  


&gt;In Moscow and the surrounding region, which together account for nearly 25% of new daily infections, the nonworking period won‚Äôt be extended beyond Nov. 7, officials said.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Certain restrictions will remain in place in the Russian capital, such as a stay-at-home order for older adults and a mandate for businesses to have 30% of their staff work from home. Access to theaters and museums is limited to those who either have been fully vaccinated, have recovered from COVID-19 within the last six months or can present a negative coronavirus test.  


But only about 15% of the population. Hope the one week semi-lockdown helped.  


&gt;But reports by Russia‚Äôs state statistical service Rosstat that tally coronavirus-linked deaths retroactively reveal much higher mortality numbers than the task force‚Äôs. A report released last week indicated that about 462,000 people with COVID-19 died between April 2020 and last September.  
Russian officials have said the task force only includes deaths for which COVID-19 was the main cause and uses data collected from medical facilities. Rosstat uses wider criteria for counting virus-related deaths and takes its numbers from civil registry offices where the process of registering a death is finalized.  


Even after months when Rosstat corrects the number of Covid deaths, they still have excess deaths that is not Covid deaths. Community spread pneumonia and old age as cause of deaths spiked last year.

[],,TheLordSnod,,,[],,,,text,t2_8h8m0,False,False,[],"In the Spanish flu, no country reported the deaths or anything about the situation, only Spain did, so everyone called it the Spanish flu.  This was because of ww1 and no country wanting to give any sign to their enemies that their armies or populations were being affected.  They also didn't want soldiers to become afraid and not fight or lose their nerves being afraid of both the enemy and the virus.

So back then it made sense.

They might be doing the same right now for covid.  Military deaths and even case numbers are usually kept as quiet as possible if not entirely.

It it ok?  Not really I wish people knew how much worse this virus really is.  But this is likely the logic.

Not only does it affect the morale of soldiers, it affects morale of civilians, and that could have more ripple effects on productivity in the local and national economies of a nation.  They likely want to find a balance between having people be cautious but not to the point of panic, and that an acceptable percentage of deaths by under reporting the virus will be better for the economy than going all in and showing the real numbers.

It's like how they eased everyone into lockdowns.  They damn well knew it was airborne and spreading in the air like wildfire, they knew it was already here months before.  They knew masks were needed.  I bought masks months prior to them recommending and then mandating them.  They said to wash your hands (literally never spreads like this now we know for fact).

They slowly reported on it, picked up pace, downplayed it but increased the seriousness over time, and still, people panic bought and got unruly.  Pretty lame for them to lie the whole time, but I can see the logic, they know humans and especially Americans are irrational and panicky, if they were to be fully honest at the start, tell you to stay home and wear a mask and shut everything down immediately. People would have lost their minds and civil unrest would have fucked things up even worse. 

Psychologically speaking they did all that to keep order, when you ease someone into a shitty situation it's much less shock and panic for them than just being thrown into it full blown.  

In an ideal world, people would just cooperate and work together when provided with the truth.  But it only takes a small amount of people to panic and then everyone else panics because people are panicking.  

This is why most shortages of supplies are artificial, irs not that there is no supplies coming, its that people saw other people buying everything all at once and this snowballs into everyone doing it all at once.",,,,1635990432,{},hj8aymp,False,t3_qm1emq,False,False,t1_hj70ycb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qm1emq/according_to_the_economist_estimates_the_number/hj8aymp/,1636223117.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adults typically get chickenpox immunity from childhood. Either most children get natural immunity from suffering from chickenpox, or most children get immunity from the vaccine.

COVID obviously isn't facing the the ""20-80% from childhood into adulthood"" problem anytime soon.

An office is a lot different than a gas station. And I'm mainly thinking about situations where you're in close proximity with strangers, whether at a store, or even more poignantly, at a crowded event. You're not having much meaningful social interaction with the strangers you pass, so I think there it makes a lot more sense to wear a mask.

Also, ""a little sniffles once a year"" is really not fair. I have sniffles all the time. Whenever the air is cold, I sniff a lot. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the sickness I got at an amusement park this past summer, that put me in bed for two weeks. And had lingering symptoms for over a month after that. If wearing a mask could have reduced my chance of experiencing that sickness, then hell yeah it would have been worth it, and I regret being so careless in hindsight, in the midst of a pandemic, because I got vaccinated for one disease and thought I was invincible.

Ultimately, once the mandates are lifted, it's going to be a calculus of risk versus reward. I just think there is value in keeping masks around in *some* situations, and I hope there isn't a stigma against those of us who choose to continue wearing them (again, not in all situations, but where and when it makes the most sense), because some others of us have felt that our autonomy was completely violated by the state not wanting us to breathe on other people during a deadly respiratory pandemic.",,,,1636041765,{},hjaowkt,False,t3_qlsys7,False,True,t1_hjan6b2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qlsys7/denmark_experts_recommend_return_of_facemasks/hjaowkt/,1636270133.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Vaccine development, certification, and rollout was amazing - maybe not ""world leading"", but right up there amongst the best.  There have been some smart decisions - like deciding to concentrate on giving as many people as possible the first vaccination even though that means delaying the second shot.  Not everything has been perfect, but overall it's been really well done.

However, everything else has been disastrous.  Every single measure has been introduced too late, every time against frustrated scientific advice.  At this point, infection rates are pretty much the worst they've ever been and not getting better and it's sweeping like wildfire through schools of (mostly unvaccinated) children and spreading to their families.  Even basic precautions like mask mandates have been abandoned, seemingly for no particular reason.

My *strong* suspicion is that the UK strategy was to vaccinate as strongly as possible, then remove as many measures as possible in a push for herd immunity - i.e. whilst the second dose is still effective and the number of deaths is therefore minimised.  If you take the view that getting Covid at least once is an inevitability and that it can't be managed until there is sufficient herd immunity, then I guess it makes sense.  If that's the plan, then the astronomical infection rate and low death rate I guess represent some degree of success - and it explains the lack of any measures to curb the infection rate (even basic and ""free"" ones like mask mandates).",,,,1636045848,{},hjazjsj,False,t3_qmi701,False,False,t3_qmi701,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qmi701/bbc_news_first_pill_to_treat_covid_gets_approval/hjazjsj/,1636275538.0,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,ekac,,,[],,,,text,t2_4qskx,False,False,,"It takes a bit of abstract understanding.  You are not *just* a single person.  You are a construct of billions of individual cells working together like a machine.  

That construct is constantly fighting off invaders, not just COVID.  Bacterial invaders, viral invaders, and parasitic invaders.  The defense system of that cellular construct, is termed the ""immune system"".  It doesn't imply any sort of ""immunity"" - it simply is the name given to cells that serve that purpose in the body.

That immune system is broken into two groups - innate and adaptive.  The innate system is - from an evolutionary standpoint, ancient.  It's basic.  It sees something foreign, engulfs it, and takes it to the lymph nodes.  Once in the lymph, your lymph shut and swell with B-cells.  B- and T-cells are part of the adaptive immune system.  They create a cascading affect almost like Calvary in a war.  But they need time to be trained to recognize the target they're sent after.  This is why doctors feel under your chin, they want to see if your lymph is swollen, which would indicate your body is training B-cells.

The vaccine gives you safe, dead parts of the virus so your immune system can train B-cells to attack.  But there will still be a battle inside your body.  It becomes a war of attrition, and ultimately a battle of birth rate : death rate for both your immune system and the invading virus.  The vaccine lets you get a head start, and gives you an advantage.  But the war still needs to be fought.

As people age, the thymus shrinks.  This is part of the adaptive immune system.  The not basic part.  As that shrinks, your immune system weakens.  So older people will be immunocomprimised.  Sickness, other environmental factors will increase that compromise.  So for some, the vaccine won't really make too much of a difference; the base is unguarded.  Those who are infected will serve as incubators for the virus to spread.

This is why other mitigations are so important.  Think of humans like a metaphorical virus.  We want to colonize Mars.  If Mars was only 100 miles away, not a big deal.  As it is, Mars is 240 million miles from Earth.  So we have a much bigger hurdle to colonize Mars.  COVID is the same way between people.  It wants to **COLONIZE YOU**.

The 75% number was never a hard metric, just a number that was thrown out as a possible number for effective herd immunity. Since then they realized herd immunity is not a possibility, and we're going to be dealing with cases for the long haul. 

Also it's cute that you think people are still wearing masks here from a walk through a grocery store, but spend more than a few minutes here and you'll see that mask compliance is in the toilet, especially in the high transmission risk venues like restaurants, bars, and entertainment venues. 

Luckily due to our high vaccination status, our death rate throughout the Delta surge moved only slightly throughout a surge of cases, and now is basically where it was when we removed restrictions in the Spring. Vaccines did that, not some spotty mask compliance in a few limited venues, in a few cities.

We're where we need to be to start thinking about the end of this, and boosters and pediatric vaccines will only accelerate that over the next few weeks.

Most medical associations and doctors stand behind STIKO, and STIKO dont give ""just recommendations"", they are germanys highest, evidence and science based expert committee with international recognition for their high quality of work. Whereas Spahns idea is politically, and not scientifically motivated, as bullbear said.

Kassen√§rztliche Vereinigung are against Spahns idea, their chief, Andreas Gassen, recently said Spahn should stay out of that debate and let the doctors do their jobs.

Martin Scherer, president of Deutschen Gesellschaft f√ºr Allgemeinmedizin und Familienmedizin also spoke against Spahns idea and similarily as Mertens, head of STIKO reminding people to take their 1st and 2nd shots first, the unvaccinated are a lot more important at the moment.

Second in command of KBV Stephan Hofmeister said this crude comment of Spahn causes a lot of trouble in doctors offices and doctors are flooded with people who want the booster but arent egligible. Doctors offices follow STIKO advices and dont booster anyone. Doctors offices dont have the capacity to booster anyone in regards to closed vaccination centers.

√Ñrztepr√§sident Klaus Reinhardt also mentioned general practitioners will booster people according to STIKO recommendations. It is not reasonable to booster healthy young people, there is no evidence for that, he further said.

Kassen√§rzte-Chef Andreas Gassenwarned for blind actionism.

STIKO is the leading committee for any vaccine questions since decades in germany. Blind actionism and agitation in the population threaten to disregard medical evidence and good practise, which, IMO is a bit rediculous. STIKO will need some weeks to gather good evidence to recommend boosters when reasonable.

Health care workers with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection followed by 2 doses of mRNA vaccine (3 independent exposures to spike antigen) developed higher spike antibody measurements than individuals with vaccination alone. Consistent with work comparing extended vaccine dosing intervals, the study showed that a longer interval between infection and first vaccine dose may enhance the antibody response.6

Limitations of the study included defining SARS-CoV-2 infection as positive PCR test results (potentially misclassifying participants with unconfirmed prior infection), the use of convenience sampling, and a small proportion of included participants with infection prior to vaccination. The study also did not examine neutralization titers or reinfection. Generalizability may be limited by a majority female, White, middle-aged population.

Further investigation is warranted to determine whether increased postvaccination antibody durability in previously infected individuals is attributable to number of exposures, interval between exposures, or the interplay between natural and vaccine-derived immunity.

&gt;if, hypothetically, the virus did not cause severe illness/death at the rate it does, would we have needed lockdowns/closures, masks, distancing, etc?

Would seem a bit silly wouldn't it?  I'm gonna go with ""no"".  Speaking from the US that would have never flown here.  Even measures for Covid-19 as its lethality actually is barely did.

&gt;I fully recognize that people need to get vaccinated, but isn‚Äôt that sort of what we were all under the impression the endgame of this would be?

Personally I was never under that impression for the US. We're a uniquely troubled country.  
However, what is important to note is that a lot of people were under the impression (myself once included) that achieving like 80% + vax rate meant *defeating* Covid-19.  Vaccine makers actually never made that claim though.  The messaging about the vaccine to the public had a lot of mess ups.

which links to:

&gt;If the vaccines are great at preventing the reasons were instituted the measures, why do we need the measures?

Short answer: we really don't.  So long as risk is sufficiently managed to not overload the medical system.

The backlash you see against dropping Covid measures though is due in part to that messaging error.

In countries like the US though the vaccine and Covid measures are also heavily politicized.  
So not entirely dislike a Christian Fundamentalist, the Pro-vax Pro Covid measures ""tribe"" takes any new scientific facts and understandings that conflict with their narrative as an attack.  

I for example, definitely still advocate for everyone getting vaccinated, at least 2-doses of a 2-dose vaccine that is, but I don't see see sufficient evidence **everyone** needs a booster.  I also think we don't need to enforce masks anymore.  

The goal was to get risk back to manageable levels.  Not get it to 0% transmission and cases. Yet that is what the vax/covid measure tribe now wants, and so if you're not for it you're the enemy now.

Eh, Covid generally takes longer than 2 weeks to kill people with medical care.

It can take over two weeks after exposure to just start feeling symptoms, if any. Then it could take a week or more of those symptoms before a person's condition deteriorates enough to be admitted to the ICU. Then, with ventilation, O2, and intubation it could take another few weeks to succumb to the virus. 

Of course, there are also cases in which the virus does hit hard and fast and  people have died within a few days of symptoms/ hospitalization as it hits everyone differently, but for most people it takes its time.

Spanish Flu back in 1918 killed horrifyingly fast, which is partially why it burnt itself out so quickly.

Another factor mentioned elsewhere is kind of the opposite. We had a limited flu season last year, due to masks. That reduced the number of flu deaths.

This applies to everybody, even those fully remote. A very large number of employees are already covered by directives around health care workers and I think part of it is essentially they are treating everybody the same. And I suspect they don't want to deal with the administrative nightmare of keeping track of testing. This might actually be one of the few upsides of At-Will employment.

We also have a very large number of MDs on the board of directors and in C suite positions so I think that also plays into the decision.

Most of the wacky claims about vaccines are not total fabrications; rather, they're based on badly garbled true facts taken out of context.

My favorite: ""The vaccine contains/causes AIDS"".   

Not true for any of the currently authorized vaccines, but one of the vaccine candidates actually contained a protein from HIV and triggered false positives on HIV tests.  

Now this  gets a big **What Were You Thinking?!?!?!?** from me but apparently HIV (the virus which causes AIDS) is now so-well studied that biomedical researchers see it more as a toolbox rather than a dread pathogen.   The vaccine developers took a protein from HIV to use as a molecular clamp to hold the spike protein.  This protein by itself isn't going to cause AIDS, but it ended up triggering the production of antibodies to that protein, and as a result trial participants started testing positive on HIV antibody tests.   The vaccine candidate was abandoned shortly after this was discovered.

It was a perfectly reasonable trade to make before vaccines, and it may still be the best option *right now,* until the population is widely vaccinated, but it cannot be the norm forever. 

If you are randomly putting millions of people into lockdown on a regular basis, you will stifle social and economic development.  People will be afraid to travel for fear they will be stuck far from home without warning, and they will not be as willing to risk opening new businesses if they have to randomly shut down sometimes.  If that happens during the Chinese New Year, for example, it can kill a small restaurant due to loss of expected profit, even if the government provides some support to pay for wages and rent.

By cutting off foreign travel, you close yourself off from the world.  And yes, enforcing a two-week quarantine for international arrivals is effectively the same as ""cutting off foreign travel.""  Foreign business will not want to invest long-term when it is so difficult to get in and see how your investments are doing.

I suspect that the Chinese leadership has made these same calculations, but their approach to governance is to communicate a clear and unambiguous message, with no room for interpretation.  This means that even if they do have, e.g. a specific level of vaccination in mind, they may not communicate that to the public, because they just want the public to go along with what the current ruleset is, without any risk of ""slacking"" as they get closer to the goal line.",,,,1636043776,{},hjau68s,False,t3_qmjch9,False,False,t1_hjajiij,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qmjch9/as_china_faces_its_most_widespread_covid_outbreak/hjau68s/,1636272798.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;Current transmission rates in 53 European countries are of ‚Äúgrave concern‚Äù and new cases are nearing record levels, exacerbated by the more transmissible Delta variant of the virus, the WHO‚Äôs Hans Kluge told a media briefing.

&gt;‚ÄúWe must change our tactics, from reacting to surges of Covid-19, to preventing them from happening in the first place,‚Äù he said.

&gt;The region saw a 6% increase in new cases last week of nearly 1.8 million new cases, compared to the week before. The number of deaths rose 12% in the same period.
If the region follows its current trajectory, Kluge said, another 500,000 Covid-19 related deaths could occur in the region by February next year.

&gt;Romania reported a record high daily number of 591 COVID-19 deaths on Tuesday amid a persistently low vaccination rate and a wave of coronavirus infections that has overwhelmed the country's ailing health care system.
About 37 per cent of adults in Romania, a European Union member with 19 million people, have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 compared to an EU average of 75 per cent.
Within the 27-member EU, only Bulgaria has a smaller share of its population vaccinated.
Romanian authorities said on Tuesday that 541 of the 591 people who had died of COVID-19 since the day before were unvaccinated.
The unfolding disaster prompted authorities to impose tighter restrictions starting last week.
Vaccination certificates are required for many day-to-day activities such as going to the gym, the cinema or a shopping mall.
For everyone, there is a 10pm curfew.
Since the pandemic started, Romania has registered more than 1.6 million confirmed cases and 48,664 deaths.
The country's previous daily death toll record of 574 was set on October 19.

&gt;Coronavirus deaths in Russia also hit another daily record high on Tuesday, four days since an order for many Russians to stay off work took effect.
Russia's state coronavirus task force reported 39,008 new confirmed cases and 1178 COVID-19 deaths.
The task force has reported record daily infections or deaths almost every day for the last month.
To reduce the spread of the coronavirus, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a country-wide non-working period for October 30-November 7.
Putin has said that governments in regions where the situation is most dire could add more non-working days, if needed.
The Novgorod region became the first one to do so Monday, extending the period by another week.
Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday brushed off rumours that the non-working period could be prolonged for all of Russia.
Russia's weekslong surge in infections and deaths comes amid low vaccination rates, lax public attitudes toward taking precautions and the government's reluctance to toughen restrictions.
Less than 35 per cent of Russia's nearly 146 million people have been fully vaccinated so far, even though Russia approved a domestically developed vaccine against the coronavirus months before most countries.
Putin on Monday described the situation with COVID-19 in Russia as ""very difficult"".
In all, Russia's state coronavirus task force has reported nearly 8.6 million confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 240,000 deaths in the pandemic - by far the highest death toll in Europe.


&gt;In Austria, more than 300 intensive care beds are being used by COVID-19 patients as of Tuesday - meaning the country is days away from a series of automatic restrictions designed to stop the disease from spreading.
According to laws put in place since the pandemic struck, once health authorities record 300 ICU beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, a one-week clock starts ticking.
Tuesday's count stood at 317, a 25-person increase in one day.
The number of patients in non-intensive care beds also jumped by 145, to 1600.
At the end of the seven days, the country will go on the second level of a five-level system.
Once level two is in effect, night-time restaurant dining and other events attended by large crowds are only open to those who can prove they are vaccinated against or have recovered from the coronavirus.
Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein expects that the next benchmark - 400 intensive care beds occupied - will be hit next week.
At that point, the next stage of the plan would be triggered, meaning unvaccinated people would have to provide negative PCR tests at the workplace or when visiting restaurants.
Rapid antigen tests would no longer apply for this group
Mueckstein also announced that booster vaccination jabs are now available to everyone.
The third shot is explicitly recommended for people over 65, for workers in the health and education sectors as well as for risk groups.
The country recorded 5398 new cases within the last 24 hours on Tuesday, which is equivalent to an incidence rate of 400 cases per 100,000 residents.

Thanks for the comment. I hadn't heard this term before. It's also called ""mortality displacement."" There's a whole Wikipedia article on it. I can probably use this term to do more reading.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_displacement

That said, I understand the concept, but it's not clear to me how you  properly analyze this. What fraction of COVID deaths would have died at that exact time, in the absence of COVID? How about, how many would have died within the next week? The next month? Year? Five years? I could imagine individual cases where any of those might apply. But would it add up to a large number? I'd be surprised.

But how would you even tell?

I guess you could look at historical deaths and then extrapolate based on the change in population. But there's some margin of error in past deaths. Some months/years have a little more or less deaths. I could see the analysis getting messy, and having large margin of error.

Generally you can not conclude from one country to another, in Mertens own words burden of disease in young generations is higher in america than in germany. Its also a well known fact that children are a lot less commonly affected by severe covid infection, therefore data has to be exceptionally good to show this smaller individual benefit. As you said yourself ""both risks of infection and vaccination are very low"". Therefore nonpharmaceutical protections should have applied for the unvaccinated children, which in fact, RKI recommended time and time again.

If the goal was to reduce deaths, then we would follow WHOs advice and get every human their 1st and 2nd doses. But we do not do that.
