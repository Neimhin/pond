She's a healthcare professional. Who can't follow simple rules. What a stupid comment for her to make. 

There are nurses/doctors/care home staff and lots of others in the healthcare profession who sacrificed so much over the last year. Care home staff stayed at some care homes, not going home for weeks during lockdowns, so they wouldn't infect the residents by catching COVID and bringing it to work with them. Doctors and nurses stayed in hotels to keep away from their families and some didn't see their children for weeks. They are the heroes of this pandemic. The people who knew first hand how terrible COVID can be, and had to deal with the sharp end of it. People dying alone and then being absolutely helpless to stop it because it is so difficult to treat, once it really gets a grip on somebody. 

So your flu shot nurse couldn't isolate for a couple of weeks? Attitudes like that are why this pandemic has had far more cases than it needed to. People didn't take simple measures like isolate when told to, or mask up.

And it spends far, far less than the United States does. Yet it achieves some outcomes Americans would find remarkable. Life expectancy at birth is two to three years longer than in Britain or the United States. Its infant mortality rate is among the lowest in the world, about half that of the United States, and just over half that of Britain, Australia, Canada and France. General mortality rates are impressive compared with pretty much all other countries as well.

I live in PA, not the smartest bunch, still alot of trump yard signs and flags, (shrug), but there is a shortage of health care workers, especially menial nursing staff which has a high turnover rate. The best medical facilities do not hire anyone without at least a BSN. So what you get is some RN who barely made it out of nursing school with just a associates degree in charge of people who went to tech school to learn how to take a BP and wipe asses. As you would assume these are not the most motivated of health care workers. Poor work conditions along with bad pay, little oversight and lack of education is strong mix for spreading of ignorance.

Both of my sons ran cross country and track in high school. Youngest is still running in college.

Even with a high level of athleticism and a relatively short break of 2-4 weeks in training, starting up would always be at a reduced level as they got back into running.

Their coach often told the team that their current ability was based on the last 21 days of effort. When you first start exercising again, the bulk of your effort (the previous 20 days) is zero so you should expect to have reduced ability. As you continue, you can build.

The other thing they did that I really liked was to ignore distance and focus on time when training. Daily training runs would be 30 minutes, or 45 minutes, or sometimes weekend long runs of 90 to 120 minutes. Pace was whatever your ability that day happened to be within the guidelines (i.e. conversational, race pace, somewhere in between).

We don't have the supplies of Pfizer to allow vaccine shopping. If we allowed it we would still be in the grips of a pandemic. 



&gt; Honestly, I'd probably never go for a scheme where they just stick a needle in and inject whatever. That just really seems to go against the principles of patient choice and informed consent.



Well you have choice &amp; consent as you are informed that's how it works before you schedule. They specifically tell you we are providing which ever vaccine is available. If you aren't ok with that wait until some day when supplies permit. You will then be able to pay out of pocket for your golden jab then.


It's the same way every other UK vaccine is administered on the NHS. No one has ever really stopped to check what brand made their flu jabs. When I got my vaccinations in the US no one ever mentioned brands either. But the US pharmacy sure as hell made it a nightmare to get a specific brands generic. And refuse point blank over the phone to answer any questions because they where class 2. 


At the end of the day the UK only had one option if we where going to get the pandemic under control fast. However the NHS being a universal healthcare system there is an acceptance of it. If I was living in the US still I would of shopped around but the lack of choice on jab outweighs my old $500 pharmacy bills in the states.",,,1618781967,{},gv0gs8f,False,t3_mtfiw0,False,True,t1_gv0chd9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mtfiw0/fauci_says_he_expects_us_to_resume_using_johnson/gv0gs8f/,1618785061,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

To your question, it is probably only marginally safer to get it from a doctor's office than a walk-in clinic.

Also ALL schools opened March 8th, and this has not caused any statistically noticeable effect on case numbers or deaths a month later.

Good news eh?

The fact is, UK has just recorded its data much more accurately and promptly than other countries. You have the obvious villains like Russia who claimed ~70,000 covid deaths for 2020 but had +400,000 excess deaths. But even in the angelic EU you have countries like Italy who delay full publication of death stats for months (due to religious and legal issues)), and it turned out some big countries like Poland and Spain had much worse excess deaths for 2020 than UK even though they reported much lower covid deaths.

The HUGE benefit of accurately recording your data in a scientifically  reliable manner is that you have more control over the future outcomes. I'm afraid most countries have failed to test enough (UK by far biggest covid tester in the world) - and hence don't really know what is happening, too many US states have not tested enough to really know how bad the virus spread is, which of course makes it hard to control.

Also, UK is world leader in dna sequencing tech, and has managed to track variants very quickly, rest of world seems almost caught by surprise by new variant rampant every few weeks.",,,1618710842,{},guxc0v7,False,t3_msum69,False,True,t1_guwjfh2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/msum69/half_of_eligible_californians_at_least_partially/guxc0v7/,1618717909,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

‚ÄúThis means that when the measles virus first enters a population where nobody has immunity, one infected person will result in 12 to 18 other infected people. That transmission will continue until roughly 95 percent of the population is immune,‚Äù says Dr. Marfin. ‚ÄúThat 95 percent is the herd immunity threshold.‚Äù

More cycles: higher likelihood of false positives


Fewer cycles: higher likelihood of false negatives


Regardless of what the ideal cutoff is, that relationship holds true. Fwiw, I remember 30 cycles was the number I heard a couple researchers recommend in the fall.

Even if 30 cycles is more likely to give correct results,  that still means more false negatives. So let's say hypothetically that before, 1% of all negatives were false negatives and 10% of all positives were false positives. Lowering the threshold to 30, again hypothetically, would mean you might see something like 2% of negative results would be false negatives, but only 5% of positives are false positives.

It will not be eradicated, but we can still achieve herd immunity to permanently keep it under control.

As for viral escape mechanisms, it's pretty straightforward actually. If you understand evolution by natural selection, then you understand how a virus would evolve to escape immune responses. Every time a virus replicates, it could randomly obtain a genetic mutation. And every mutation the virus obtains has the potential to be evolutionarily advantageous (e.g. by reducing vaccine efficacy). Every person who is infected with a virus, therefore, is essentially giving the virus another chance to evolve to outrun the vaccines.

*That* is why reducing case rates matters. The more we allow *some of us* to get infected, the likelier the vaccines will start to fail for *all of us*.

I don't have a particular reference to this, it's a pretty basic concept in virology.

1) Yes, I do live right in the centre of London. We went into lockdown on January 3rd - it was very similar to the first lockdown, except there was the stupid ‚Äúyou can see one person out doors for exercise‚Äù rule. The only difference, was that people didn‚Äôt follow the rules. Sounds like you might not have either... 

Of course I‚Äôm glad we managed to open schools on March 8th, and your right it didn‚Äôt really have much of an effect. Just a tiny plateau, but nothing to worry about.

And now the big claim: ‚Äúthe UK has just recorded its data more accurately and promptly than other countries.‚Äù For this I‚Äôm going to use an example - the bloods clots with the AZ vaccine. Preferably put aside whether you think we should be using it or not, because that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm arguing, I‚Äôm disgusting the way that they reported the data on the issue. So the MHRA has their yellow card system, which frankly fell apart. There were reports of blood clots beginning in January with one death, then February there were 4 more cases, 2 deaths and then in March I can‚Äôt recall the numbers, however, only in April did they announce that this was a potential side effect, even when it had exceeded the threshold to be labelled as such much before. The UK has an awful post-vaccine monitoring system, contrary to what we‚Äôve been told. In a country like Denmark for example, you get checked up on twice either over the phone or in person if you really wish. 

Now you said that the UK is by far the biggest COVID tester in the world. That‚Äôs simply untrue. Currently, the UK has administered somewhere around 2008 COVID tests per 1000 people throughout the pandemic. Denmark has done 4,166 per 1000 people. In fact the UK only ranks 9th.

In terms of genomic sequencing, which is what I think you were referring to, it is true that the Uk ranks highest in the number of sequences done, but not by much, only around 10000 more sequences than the USA. However, they do also rank lower than Spain in the number of sequences per test. (All data is from the International Journal of Infectious Diseases, which I most often find to be more well-known as the IJID.) In the abstract of the paper ‚ÄúGenomic sequencing efforts for SARS-CoV-2 by country during the pandemic‚Äù, and later analysis, they outline that when adjusted for population, number of sequences vs sequences per case, along with a variety of other factors, the UK in fact only ranks fourth.

They said stay away from others. You can stay away from others and still get plenty of exercise. I walk/ride bikes with my kids daily.

I row, run, bike, lift daily on my own without a gym membership, none of this is hard to do while distancing.

My father (66 yo with diabetes) has been hospitalized around end of March because of covid. For the first week he was on CPAP machine and the doctors were saying that he was able to eat without any help, talking to doctors/nurses. Then one day after the doctors telling us that they will try to take him off the CPAP machine, we were informed that he had some kind of a shock and was intubated and put on the ventilator with 100% oxygen. It has been a week and we have been told that they were able to decrease the oxygen levels being fed to 80% and his blood oxygen levels (they used a more technical term) and CO2 levels were improving, so they are thinking of Tracheostomy in the next week if the lab results show continued improvement.

We're all pretty frustrated and exhausted and the kids just want to have a sleepover!""...... That's not (even remotely close) to how any of this works. 

By what ever means necessary, we (humans) have to figure out a path to work through this thing. Together. Using whatever innovative or creative ideas we can muster. 

If you're a parent (or somehow responsible for people who ""don't understand""). then part of your responsibility is to either:

* figure out ways to help them understand

* or.. failing the above.. protect them or deny them the ability to get into unsafe situations. 

Kids don't understand things like Chainsaws or high-powered laser pointers or dangerous freeways.. so we keep them away from those things. 

The virus is unquestionably and unarguably 100% totally indiscriminate. It has no brain or heart. It gives 0 fucks. It's like a random field full of Land Mines (or like the movie ""The Terminator""). It can literally only do 2 things:.. A) Find a host and B) replicate. That's it. That's all it cares about. It doesn't care if you're 4yrs old or 84yrs old. It doesn't care if you are Rich or Poor. It doesn't care what Race or Gender or Sexuality you are. It doesn't care. 

Lockdowns and masks and social-distancing suck for everyone. But as someone who spent 38 days in the Hospital (16 of those days in ICU on a Ventilator (all 16 days having heavy-sedative induced ""ICU Delirium"" nightmares. Nonstop). ..

&gt;A year ago, when Americans were dying of Covid at an alarming rate, the federal government made a big bet on plasma. No one knew if the treatment would work, but it seemed biologically plausible and safe, and there wasn‚Äôt much else to try. All told, more than 722,000 units of plasma were distributed to hospitals thanks to the federal program, which ends this month.

&gt;The government‚Äôs bet did not result in a blockbuster treatment for Covid-19, or even a decent one. But it did give the country a real-time education in the pitfalls of testing a medical treatment in the middle of an emergency. Medical science is messy and slow. And when a treatment fails, which is often, it can be difficult for its strongest proponents to let it go.

&gt;Because the government gave plasma to so many patients outside of a controlled clinical trial, it took a long time to measure its effectiveness. Eventually, studies did emerge to suggest that under the right conditions, plasma might help. But enough evidence has now accumulated to show that the country‚Äôs broad, costly plasma campaign had little effect, especially in people whose disease was advanced enough to land them in the hospital.",,,1618745230,{},guyix2h,True,t3_mtb0z5,False,False,t3_mtb0z5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mtb0z5/the_covid19_plasma_boom_is_over_what_did_we_learn/guyix2h/,1618745240,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This is totally off subject, but an observation of mine. The real world data seems to be showing that the vaccines are more effective that the trial even showed. In the Pfizer trial around 9 people in the vaccinated group were infected. That‚Äôs out of around 15 to 20 thousand people. So we can round up and say 1 out of every 2,000 fully vaccinated got infected. In the US, around 100 million people have been fully vaccinated with 5800 getting Covid. That‚Äôs about 1 in every 17,000. Significantly better than the trial. 

So what is interesting, is the people in the trial most likely knew if they received the placebo or the real thing based on side effects like arm soreness. So those in the placebo group would be more careful and those in the vaccinated group might let their guard down. That would have resulted in worse efficacy. If everyone had been truly blind, you would expect more infections in placebo arm and less in vaccinated. 

The real world data backs up this idea. Of course, this is just my layman interpretation.

Speculating here but the public spaces are cramped on a sunny day. The UK is quite densely populated during lockdown with stay at home orders many urban areas where already heavily crowded. Encouraging more people out may have caused more spread. You may be better off exercising if you catch covid but you might be at a lower risk of catching it if you stay home.


Plus in fairness they did so in a round about way by making exercise one of the only things you could do. With nothing to do but stay home people where out exercising at rates I haven't seen before. The number of new cyclists just rolling around to escape home confinement was massive.

**Newsom Targets June 15 for California to Fully Reopen**

[https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/california/gov-newsom-targets-june-15-for-california-to-fully-reopen/2511400/](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/california/gov-newsom-targets-june-15-for-california-to-fully-reopen/2511400/)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When California fully reopens the economy, the Blueprint for a Safer Economy will end, but ***common-sense health measures such as masking will remain across the state****.* Testing or vaccination verification requirements will remain in relevant settings, the state said.

&amp;#x200B;

ignore variants and vaccinated percentage

masks go away when covid starts to cost no more than the flu.

you need ""100% vaccinated"" and that has to cook for a couple months.

&amp;#x200B;

as long as covid is running rampant (see brazil, canada, michigan) - there's a chance that a really nasty strain develops.

&amp;#x200B;

masking is in order until you're ""sure"" ***this coming winter*** is not going to be a shitstorm.

&amp;#x200B;

 today, we're not even close to these kinds of numbers (nationwide)

Nope. Not once did I say that. I‚Äôm saying that every adult who is unvaccinated will be eligible starting tomorrow, so they should go get the shot so that we CAN take off our masks.

Either a vaccine is developed to prevent additional spread of COVID-19, a treatment option is readily available that ensures health care capacity is no longer a concern, or there are no new cases over a sustained period. All sectors of the economy reopen with new health and hygiene practices permanently in place. Large gatherings of all sizes can resume. Public health experts focus on lessons learned and building out the public health infrastructure needed to meet and overcome future challenges. Heath care equity is made a priority to improve health outcomes and ensure vulnerable communities receive the quality care they deserve

All sectors of the economy reopen with businesses, schools, and recreation **resuming normal operations with new safety guidance and procedures**.

Notes:

* The raw data can be downloaded exact totals for every age group can be downloaded from the [CDC vaccination demographic trends page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends) as a CSV.  The CDC indicates the data is by ""Date Administered"", but it actually appears to be by ""Date Reported"".
* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC demographic data, so the tables do not match national totals.
* The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group. The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, assuming that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17.

When you admit your sources are bullshit, you can start to call it awareness. Making shit up or passing off made-up shit isn't ""awareness"".

&gt; Just as counterproductive as me shaming you for vaccinating.

Except that I vaccinated because I understand the science. You chose not to because you *don't*. You actively choose every day to believe bullshit over well understood science.

On Friday, at a news conference in Lakeland, he pointed to the success of that effort.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve now done close to 3.75 million seniors that have gotten at least one shot, and the overwhelming majority of that are fully vaccinated,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I think that‚Äôs one of the reasons why you see hospital admissions for seniors are less than what they were three or four months ago. So I do think it‚Äôs had a positive effect.‚Äù",,,1618709283,{},gux9ewr,True,t3_mt3fo6,False,True,t3_mt3fo6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mt3fo6/hospitalizations_plunge_among_florida_seniors_as/gux9ewr/,1618716487,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;BBC bashing 

Not undeserved.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;defending what Gao Fu said 

M? I didn't defend his words, I take them as they are.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;you vaccinate 50% for nothing 

One again, to quote an article you yourself linked:

&gt; *She says in the trial that showed an efficacy rate of around 50% many of those who got infected only had very mild symptoms or were asymptomatic. She stresses that the important thing is that no-one in the trial needed to go into intensive care.* 

Doesn't sound like ""for nothing"" to me.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;because Gao Fu didn't use the word ""garbage"" it means it is not garbage   
&gt;  
&gt;Why would anyone do that if they weren't garbage.   
&gt;  
&gt;because.... garbage vaccines. Yep 

You're so hell-bend on using the word ""garbage"". Alright, so be it. Let's consider the premise ""Chinese vaccines are garbage"" as an evidence-backed fact for now. Still, I'm waiting for you to provide support for:

The second part of your initial statement, namely that Chinese vaccines are dangerous.

The statement that Russian vaccines are garbage and dangerous. And now, China and Russia both being ""authoritarian countries that have a bad track record regarding transparency, human rights and putting politics ahead of the health of their own people"" isn't a valid reason to assert that whatever is known about Chinese pharmaceutical industry can be said about Russian industry.

That what I'm ""discrediting the messenger"" about - the simple fact that you so far can't corroborate your words.

So, one more attempt at supporting your claims.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.

&gt; ""forgetting"" ... right because the three others are on the market around the globe and are so relevant 

I'll bash BBC a bit more. They didn't forget the three other vaccines, they  forgot only one vaccine, the viral vector one, and in that article talked only about the inactivated ones which for a reader who doesn't know about CanSino would suggest that all Chinese vaccines are of inactivated type.

In addition over the last month we've got numbers from several Israeli HMOs regarding millions of people showing +90 efficacy as well (Pfizer).  This is in a country where B117 made up something like 80% of cases.  In terms of the SA variant, Pfizer released some numbers albeit the sample size was small.  From what I remember JJs sample size wasn't large either.  As it stands the SA variant doesn't seem to spread nearly at the same rate as B117, so at least short term it seems much less of a concern.

The thing about the variants is they all can spread more easily - some more easily than others. It's posted on the CDC website that 40% of cases in Florida are B1117, the British variant. Quite honestly, from a clinical view, it appears to be taking over, and causing widespread cases in a fraction of the time that the original COVID did. 

Far more dangerous is the P1 variant, which spreads even more readily than B1117, and results in far more hospitalizations and deaths, particularly in younger patients. 

We're experiencing a B1117-driven spike. The danger lies in the possibility that P1 will take over as it has in Brazil. If so, we'd better brace for the collapse of our medical system. Yes, it will be *that* bad. 

Incidentally, I had my first COVID patient from Brazil yesterday, he had just flown in from Brazil, and was terrified. (He saw what was happening there.)

EU made a deal with AstraZeneca before UK and with Pfizer before Israel - it's absolutely clear that these deals are not first come first served. 

AstraZeneca couldn't produce as much as they thought and found that although the wording of the deal is essentially the same, it's meaning is different in the UK legal system compared to Belgian system (where the EU deal was made), and they could get out of their problems by citing the best efforts clause and it's different ramifications under different legal systems. Maybe the could have made a bigger deal, but the current one is not fulfilled - they are producing as fast as they can, and ordering more wouldn't have changed that.

Pfizer had some early hiccups but have now caught up and are soon surpassing their Q2 initial commitments. This is an even clearer example of why the ""they should have made bigger initial deals"" idea is silly: Pfizer were pushing production as hard as they could, and when they got their numbers up, they moved 50M deliveries from Q3 to Q2. It doesn't matter how many millions the EU initially made a deal for, ramping up production just took a while. 

There are valid criticisms of the EU vaccine program - they definitely could have invested public money in production facilities, or provided larger loans (they did provide a 100M‚Ç¨ loan to BioNTech), but the idea that a faster deal or bigger order would have mattered is just not plausible.",,,1618758790,{},guz4ql8,False,t3_mt7yqf,False,True,t1_guyip6b,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mt7yqf/daily_discussion_thread_april_18_2021/guz4ql8/,1618758907,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;THIMPHU, Bhutan ‚Äî The Lunana area of Bhutan is remote even by the standards of an isolated Himalayan kingdom: It covers an area about twice the size of New York City, borders far western China, includes glacial lakes and some of the world‚Äôs highest peaks, and is inaccessible by car.

&gt;Still, most people living there have already received a coronavirus vaccine.

&gt;Vials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine arrived last month by helicopter and were distributed by health workers, who walked from village to village through snow and ice. Vaccinations proceeded in the area‚Äôs 13 settlements even after yaks damaged some of the field tents that volunteers had set up for patients.

&gt;‚ÄùI got vaccinated first to prove to my fellow villagers that the vaccine does not cause death and is safe to take,‚Äù Pema, a village leader in Lunana who is in his 50s and goes by one name, said by telephone. ‚ÄúAfter that, everyone here took the jab.‚Äù

&gt;Lunana‚Äôs campaign is part of a quiet vaccine success story in one of Asia‚Äôs poorest countries. As of Saturday, Bhutan, a Buddhist kingdom that has emphasized its citizens‚Äô well-being over national prosperity, had administered a first vaccine dose to more than 478,000 people, over 60 percent of its population. The Health Ministry said this month that more than 93 percent of eligible adults had received their first shots.

Hey u/catsinabasket, what ended up happening with your wedding? Still canceled?

&gt;I'm so pissed today. I'm a service electrician. So I go into client's homes to fix or work on random electrical problems or additions.
Today I went and worked on a woman's lights. She bought new ones to be installed, so not pressing whatsoever. After I'd been there for 4 hours, which she'd been coughing weird the whole time, she started wandering around with a freaking mask on. Then she proceeds to stand within feet of me while I'm working and call her doctor to complain about how she can't stop coughing, has a fever, and is short of breath. Here I am working in her home for hours and she never even mentions she's sick. Then suddenly she dons a mask and basically describes COVID19 symptoms to a T right next to me to her doctor. Now I have been potentially exposed for NO REASON. I am so mad at her. I want to beat her up. How stupid and selfish can people be? I'm just hoping she wasn't really positive. There's been weird colds going around here lately and I kept my distance... But still. I was careful but would've been more careful by not coming to do the work if she told me she was sick like that when I called her this morning. I'm glad I'm only 26. So it shouldn't be too much to worry about, except for the fact I might lose weeks of work if I have to self quarantine in the coming days. I am so so so angry. I just had to rant.

Hey u/North0House, curious if you ended up getting Covid from this or since? You mentioned you‚Äôre an electrician, how has your job been handling Covid?

&gt; I just went to urgent care this morning. Dry cough, runny nose, difficulty breathing, tight chest. They gave me a breathing treatment. Las Vegas, Nevada, USA I have not had a fever since I was 5. I've been sick many many times since then and I can't get fevers. I explained this to them. They still refused to test me because no fever. They told me to self quarantine as much as possible and if I go out to wear a facemask and stay 6 feet away from people. Refused to give me an official quarantine because they couldn't without the test. They couldn't test without the fever. My job cannot give me 14 days without official quarantine or else they must take disciplinary action. I told them to go ahead, I'm not coming in until it's been 24 hours with no symptoms.

Hey u/RedeRules770 did you end up okay through this? How has quarantine been going?

Michael Wood, administrator of the state‚Äôs department of Occupational Safety and Health, said the move is necessary to address a technicality in state law that requires a ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù rule to keep current restrictions from expiring.



&gt;Opponents also are upset government officials won‚Äôt say how low Oregon's COVID-19 case numbers must go, or how many people would have to be vaccinated, to get the requirements lifted in a state that‚Äôs already had some of the nation‚Äôs strictest safety measures.



&gt;Wood said he is reviewing all the feedback to see if changes are needed before he makes a final decision by May 4, when the current rules lapse.

So, due to the way the state law is written, they can't just renew the temporary mandate; they *have* to put something 'permanent' in place by May 4 or let everything expire. They *just* reopened schools and need to see how that impacts case numbers before lifting the mandate so they can't just let it expire.

It seems like a reasonable solution to the technicality they have to work with, though I wish they'd decided on and published their intended metrics for guiding reopening. That said, Washington has revised our metrics a few times so I understand the hesitancy to make any permanent decisions on milestones when the situation is so dynamic.

for instance hunger levels can be influenced by various things like genetics, what you actually eat, and even your past weight history - people who lose weight tend to deal with increased hunger levels for at least a year, which is speculated to be part of why most people gain back any weight they lose within a year. the hunger eventually stabilize at the new weight, but it takes a while. what i'm calling 'hunger levels' is really 'the interaction between various hormones' (like ghrelin, leptin, etc), which is interesting to read about.

we have some influence over hunger levels, which ranges from more esoteric methods like eating a ketogenic diet to simply sticking to foods generally regarded as highly satiating like boiled potatoes, greek yogurt, etc, so being intentional about this can help a lot. on the other hand, we don't have full control over this, so it helps to realize not everyone's situation is equal. some people are legitimately dealing with a more challenging hunger level and our own level of willpower might very well be insufficient in their situation.

there's lots of other stuff too like poor sleep is correlated with weight gain, probably because it impacts impulse control, so something seemingly unrelated like getting nose/sinus surgeries to improve breathing (which improves quality of sleep) could make it easier for someone to lose weight - but another person's sleep issue might not be something they can fix, and then again they're dealing with a challenging situation. there are also all kinds of issues like brain injuries or past history of alcoholism that can impact impulse control in a less curable way.

ultimately there's no single solution, just lots of different ways to potentially help people based on their individual situations, and a need for compassion for people who are not successful and may be dealing with issues other than their weight that demand more of their time and focus.

Some of the weight you lose and gain immediately is water retention so really I suppose I have managed to keep my weight off if I look at that average. 

I went from 215 to 172, now back to 178. 

When I was doing Keto I didn't stress about macros other than carbs. So in that respect it was more like Vinnie Totorichs' NSNG diet (no sugar, no grains) I just read the label on everything until I understood what foods were made up of carbohydrates and then ruled them out wherever possible. 

This simplistic set of rules will lead to eating high fat (which is fine, even good) and even high saturated fat if you aren't paying attention but it isn't meant to be a long term diet. Actually might raise ldl cholesterol in the short term. (you know, talk to your doctor, everyone etc) 

 What keto's opponents don't consider is how your relationship with food changes almost immediately. I know that you can't just eat lettuce wrapped fast food and trays of bacon forever - but you can do it for a few weeks and then you start to find that you don't crave food at all. Once the sugar is out of your system, when you begin to burn fat instead, you become satiated all the time - because you already have fat to burn. If you're a stress eater (or have another need to masticate) then I suppose you might overeat - but I've honestly seen a few people in my family survive this too as the stress eating dies down once the hunger is gone. I believe they are related. 

Remember I quit smoking at the same time, and I worried that I'd need a crutch like eating to help with that - so many gain weight after they quit - but I didn't because you stop caring about food even if you're a food lover. 

Then - you just start walking occasionally or some other menial exercise - this got addictive for me plus I had the free time not making large meals for everyone. This should be even easier now as there are so many keto options for little snacks and things that weren't there when I started. I only eat once a day and then little snacks

The transition back from Keto to a normal diet happened gradually for me, as I began to eat more normal foods (like having the one tortilla with my otherwise keto mexican dish), having a corn dog at a soccer game -  until I suddenly gained 4 lbs in one day (water retention) and I got hungry again.  Took almost a month to fall out of ketosis back into my body wanting carbs and later when I got to 185 or so and decided to go back on Keto, it took 3 weeks to get back into it. I don't know why, I might have been cheating a little but my advice to anyone trying is 'do better tomorrow' but like, forever. Just always do better tomorrow. And don't wait for results, they come to you when follow the rules and quit thinking about it. Honestly though it was super fast. 

These days I'm so addicted to working out I have to make time for it and I eat plenty of  fat and protein and just low or ""slow"" carbs if I can help it.

The whole point is vaccines is to achieve herd immunity so that risk is essentially eliminated. While it is virtually impossible to achieve via lockdowns, it is incredibly easy to get di minimus case load and, over a long enough timeframe, domestic eradication simply from getting more shots in arms. 

It happens naturally if enough people are vaccinated. Once a high enough rate of vaccination is achieved, restrictions can be fully eliminated and the virus will still drive down to zero over time ""on its own"" so to speak. But it takes a high rate of vaccination to achieve this.

As an example, you have less risk as an unvaccinated person in Israel today than a vaccinated person in Israel did in early January when they were at their peak of cases.

I am not proud. It is just something that happens. The EU blocks exports, the UK does not. The EU accuses the UK of blocking exports. People somehow miss the lies and hipocracy.

The EU doesn't export any vaccines. International companies manufacturer some vaccines in the EU for paying customers outside. The EU generously allows most of those vaccines (legitimately paid for) to be exported. Not all though.

The EU didn't make any vaccines.

And I am not getting ""holier than thou"", the EU attacked the UK, just like you did in your post. I am just making you aware of the facts.

The sooner we all get vaccinated the better for all of us, which is why I do understand the EU panicking, but accusing the UK of blocking exports while doing so themselves is a disgrace.

If my incidence rate of death via COVID is 1/20,000 infections, and the odds of me getting a blood clot is 1/40,000 injections, then in my mind there's no point in getting vaccinated because there's no guarantee I'll even get COVID (which that infection rate depends on where you live but the data has always suggested you get infected through obvious mismanagement of risk, which is still incredibly low).

Warning signs remain. The hospitalization rate for younger people has begun creeping upward, paralleling a drop in the age of the average person with COVID. And while most Florida seniors have been vaccinated, many have not, and they remain vulnerable to a disease that [**appears to be spreading**](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/coronavirus/fl-ne-florida-coronavirus-friday-april-16-20210416-pdnuf2ntq5ggdijxzwoojlg3zm-story.html) as more people venture out to restaurants, clubs and social gatherings.

Based on current run rate of doses administered (7-day moving average for each state) and the available supply (doses delivered minus doses administered), I calculate ""days of supply"" as a proxy for likely constraint. 

If there are more than 21 days of supply, I assume that the state is demand constrained: the state is probably not able to effectively use all of its doses. 

If there are between 14 and 21 days of supply, it is unclear whether that state is either demand constrained or supply constrained (or just has bad logistics). 

if there are less than 14 days of supply, then I assume the state is supply constrained - if they had more doses, they could probably get more shots in arms. 

On a week over week basis, no state moved from ""demand constrained"" to ""supply constrained"". 9 states became demand constrained (noted with an asterisk below): Montana, Idaho, South Carolina, North Carolina, Indiana, Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Kansas. With rounding, you could add Washington D.C., and Florida to that list. In addition, 6 states went from ""Supply Constrained"" to ""Unclear"". 

While there is some potential impact from unused JnJ vaccines in this data, the reality is that the underlying trend is very clear: demand is becoming a limiting factor in more and more states. Barring major changes in vaccine demand characteristics, it is likely that we are just past or near the peak of vaccine administration.

Look, I read through your comments and you can't quite understand why masking and large events don't make sense together. To me it's pretty clear that you can reduce your risk when doing risky things to lower the overall risk. That's the sort of trade-offs most of us have been doing through this whole year. That's why we've required masks in necessary places where people congregate, like grocery stores.

Now things are getting better and they're saying that we'll soon be able to gather together to do less necessary things like concerts...but we should still wear a mask now to mitigate said risk. It's the same idea. 

You can dial up risk only so much. Not wearing a mask and congregating both increase the overall risk pool for people.

Yeah so there's thing called, uh, ""population density"". It's hugely responsible for the anomaly you're talking about. There's another thing called ""median age of population"". Both of those are responsible for the death rates in those states you're referring to.

They may also need annual booster shots for maximum protection against infection, Bourla told [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/15/pfizer-ceo-says-third-covid-vaccine-dose-likely-needed-within-12-months.html) on Thursday.  
              
&gt;The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was granted an emergency use authorization by the U.S. [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.upi.com/topic/Food_and_Drug_Administration/) in December, was found to offer up to 95% protection against severe infection for up to six months in clinical trials.  
    
&gt;New virus variants could weaken that immunity, even though the shot has proven effective against the most common new COVID-19 strain, the so-called ""U.K. variant,"" in [recent studies](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2021/03/11/israel-pfizer-biontech-covid-vaccine-study/4421615478171/).

&gt;Moderna said Tuesday that its vaccine protects for [up to six months](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2021/04/14/moderna-covid-vaccine-results/6291618397320/).

You‚Äôre just making more excuses. CoVID19 doesn‚Äôt care why you‚Äôre fat, just that you‚Äôre fat and you have a heightened base inflammation level. You can make excuses, or you can do something about it.

No, that‚Äôs enabling, not compassion, and who is the kid supposed to turn to when the single parent gets sick, or dies?

That is something I had to think about this whole pandemic, what happens if I get sick and my wife has to choose between being one of the few ICU Docs in the region or taking care of our kids. So despite being absurdly low risk, I took every precaution in an area where people were making a point of going our more often than normal even as our ICU‚Äôs were well over capacity.

Nope. It‚Äôs not compassionate at all to pretend like there‚Äôs not a problem, or that it‚Äôs too hard to solve the problem. EVERYONE has 30 minutes a day to work out.

(Nasdaq: RIGL), today announced positive topline results from a multi-center, Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety of fostamatinib, its oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor,¬†for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

The trial, being conducted in collaboration with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Inova Health System, met its primary endpoint of safety.¬†Fostamatinib reduced the incidence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) by half.¬† By day 29, there were three SAEs¬†in the fostamatinib plus¬†standard of care (SOC) group of thirty patients compared to six SAEs in the placebo plus SOC group of twenty-nine patients¬†(p=0.23). Of these, there was a reduction for the disease related SAE of hypoxia in the fostamatinib group compared to placebo¬†(1 vs 3, respectively; p=0.29).

""Despite the growing arsenal of vaccines gaining emergency use authorization, COVID-19 continues to spread and patients remain in need of effective therapies. We are extremely pleased with the outcome of this trial, which provides early indications of the potential positive impact of fostamatinib for patients with COVID-19,"" said Raul Rodriguez, president and CEO of Rigel. ""These results are an important addition to the extensive accumulation of data evaluating fostamatinib in COVID-19, which also include the ongoing Phase 2 study with Imperial College London and our own Phase 3 clinical trial being conducted in the U.S. and Latin America.""

""Fostamatinib was shown to be well tolerated in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 on oxygen. Taken altogether, the results of this trial suggest fostamatinib may be a useful addition to improve the outcome of severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients who are at the highest risk of death despite treatment with the best conventional therapies under the current standard of care (including remdesivir and steroids),""¬†said Wolfgang Dummer, M.D., Ph.D., Rigel's Chief Medical Officer. ""Consistent with the observed clinical outcomes, we are encouraged to see that in patients receiving fostamatinib there was a more rapid decline in a number of inflammatory biomarkers, that have previously been shown to be associated with the course of COVID-19 disease, compared to those receiving placebo.""

Key findings from the Phase 2 clinical data readout include:

* *At Day 29, in the overall population there were zero deaths in the fostamatinib group of thirty patients compared to three deaths in the placebo group of twenty-nine patients (p=0.07). In more severe patients, those with an ordinal scale assessment of 6 or 7, the difference was zero of nineteen patients compared to three of seventeen patients (p=0.049), respectively.*
* *There were four intubated patients in the trial on mechanical ventilation (ordinal scale 7) with two patients randomized to each treatment group. Both patients in the fostamatinib group improved within 7 days and came off the ventilator, while both patients in the placebo group deceased.*
* *Fostamatinib was superior to* *placebo* *in accelerating improvement in clinical status by day 15 (mean change -3.6* *compared to* *-2.6, p=0.035) and by day 29 (mean change -4.2* *compared to* *-3.3, p=0.12) using ordinal scale assessments.*
* *The median number of days in the ICU was reduced by 4 days, from 7 days in the placebo group to 3 days in the fostamatinib group (p=0.07).*
* *Despite general SOC use of both steroids and remdesivir in all 59 patients, there was a consistently greater reduction in NETosis and other inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, Ferritin, D-Dimer, Fibrinogen) in the fostamatinib group as compared to the placebo group.*

Investigators will conduct full and detailed analyses in the coming weeks.

Based on these data, Rigel plans to discuss the potential for emergency use authorization (EUA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of fostamatinib as a treatment for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. ¬†Fostamatinib, marketed in the U.S. as TAVALISSE¬Æ (fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate) tablets, is approved in the U.S., Europe, and Canada as a treatment for adult chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).",,,1618766275,{},guzk5p2,True,t3_mth1ae,False,False,t3_mth1ae,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mth1ae/positive_topline_data_shows_fostamatinib_meets/guzk5p2/,1618767263,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I can't speak for other chains, but as far as Walgreens, we're drowning in prescriptions and vaccinations.

 At my store, with just 1 pharmacist and 1.5 technicians, we're expected to fill 200 prescriptions and at the same time vaccinate between 70-90 shots per day. Basically you're looking at around 1 shot per 5-7 minutes. Now, you may think that's not too bad, it doesn't take that much time to inject a person. It doesn't, if all I have to do is inject, I can probably do 10 people in less than 5 minutes. Unfortunately, it takes 5 minutes or more to bill the claim, counsel the patients, all the extra fun stuff just for 1 single injection. 

Now add the 200 prescriptions, the phone calls, patients picking up scripts. So how do you accomplish that? You basically will have to multi-task, answering calls while typing scripts while ringing up patients while counseling another patients while reconstitute the vaccine. It's an environment that just begging for mistakes. Not just vaccination, but filling errors as well. 

Have I brought this up with my district managers? Yes. Do corporate care? Nope. We started out with 30 shots a day, we complained, then they increased to 50-60 shots a day, more complaints, now they increased to 70-90 shots per day.

As for Michigan, it seems to me they got unlucky. If you have (e.g.) 40% of the population vulnerable (the other 60% have been vaccinated or have natural immunity), then it's just much harder for exponential spread to take root in the community. 

But if you get unlucky and there's enough community transmission, then we can still see the exponential growth among the 40% that don't have immunity.

if they add exercise and nothing else, the factors that lead to them consuming more calories than they need will be in place, so they'll simply end up consuming more calories. they have slightly raised their maintenance calories, but they won't have changed 'that which leads to them consuming more calories than they need.' even if they slightly raised the amount of calories necessary to stay the same weight, the factors that lead to them overconsuming are still in place to cancel that out, so they won't have changed anything in terms of their weight.

&gt;‚ÄùIt may not be unambiguous in the legal text that universities can require the vaccination of students, but I think we have many, many years of precedent,‚Äù Feldman said.

&gt;A student sued the University of California in 1925, claiming he met all the school‚Äôs attendance requirements, except for the smallpox vaccination mandate. A judge sided with the university. A 2015 California law that required vaccines for schoolchildren withstood legal challenges as well.

&gt;Feldman called the pushback about the coronavirus vaccines‚Äô emergency authorization ‚Äúoverblown.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe FDA didn‚Äôt provide emergency-use authorization at the last minute without having a very robust set of data that demonstrates the safety and efficacy of the vaccine,‚Äù Feldman said. ‚ÄúIn terms of emergency-use authorization, the universities are on pretty safe ground.‚Äù

&gt;More schools are expected to join AU and Georgetown. Maryland‚Äôs attorney general recently advised that the state‚Äôs university system can legally mandate vaccinations, according to a letter sent to state Sen. James C. Rosapepe (D-Prince George‚Äôs), whose district includes the University of Maryland at College Park.

They stopped it temporarily so they could figure out how to treat the side effect. The clotting is an odd type of clotting that is not treatable by the most common, go-to method that doctors use for clotting.  I think that treatment actually makes this type of clotting worse (check me on that).  So they had to get their ducks in a row about HOW to treat this clotting, because even though it IS rare, it DOES happen and as they give J&amp;J shots it is going to happen again.  So they have to be prepared to treat it properly, and all doctors on the country need to know what to look out for and what to do and more importantly what not to do when their patients get the clotting. Because when they resume people ARE going to clot. But now we know what to do.
2. You can't base your reaction to things in science around nutjob anti-vaxxers.  Anti-vaxxers are gonna anti-vaxx no matter what you do.  If they had NOT paused giving J&amp;J shots, the anti-vaxxers would have used THAT as proof that the vaxxines kill people and are not trustworthy and that the government is out to kill you.  No matter what is done anti-vaxxers are going to take it as confirmation that vaxxines are evil, COVID is fake, the government is big/bad, or whatever they want to believe.

Other than that, I think it comes down to pretty favorable demographics and likely a very effective set of organizers running the vaccine effort. In a smaller state like New Hampshire, it is possible to do very individualized analysis and optimization with a small group of ""doers"" at the top. Bigger states run into problems of greater delegation of responsibility, which leads to diffusion of responsibility and authority. 

Other small states saw this effect early on as well: West Virginia, the Dakotas, and Alaska all did exceptional jobs early on mobilizing for the effort. Big states like California had to spend more time setting up the infrastructure because what 10 people can do in NH takes 500 people in California. Unlike most other small states (like WV, SD, Wyoming, New Mexico) that did well at the start, NH's demographics are more favorable to demand so they kept up their strong performance later whereas those states have started to fade into the stretch.

Many of the ‚Äúvariants of concern‚Äù seem to have a lot of mutations, and there is some evidence that these mutations may come from infections of single immunocompromised individuals who have trouble clearing the virus (See https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.10.20248871v1.)  So one reason to get vaccinated is to help stop the virus from reaching people who will be mutation factories.

COVID can also mess you up even if you survive.  Long COVID and post-COVID syndromes have been observed, and these seem to be happening in populations with lower rates of actually dying from COVID-19.  In a study of over 236,000 COVID-positive patients, about 1 in 8 developed at least one psychiatric or neurological symptom for the first time within six months of their COVID diagnosis (see https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(21)00084-5/fulltext or, if you don‚Äôt want to accept cookies, see the preprint version at https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.16.21249950v1.full.pdf).

Finally, at least in the US all of the available COVID vaccines take some time to take effect.  If a new nasty variant starts hitting younger, as the UK B.1.1.7 variant may well be doing (see https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/covid-more-young-people-hospitalized-as-more-contagious-variants-spread.html), it may be wise to already be vaccinated.  I‚Äôll also note that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines appear to have usable effect against the UK B.1.1.7 variant and, while lessened, even against the ‚Äúimmune escape‚Äù South Africa B.1.351 and Brazil P.1 variants (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2102017 and https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03398-2_reference.pdf) and hopefully they‚Äôll also have some useful effect against newer serious variants that occur.
