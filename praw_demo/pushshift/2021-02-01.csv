So far no variant is making vaccines ineffective. They are making them slightly less effective but that isn’t the overall concern. The overall concern is 1) vaccine distribution and 2) public behaviors.

Vaccine distribution has had problems since their release a month and a half ago. We were promised 100mil shots in arms but we didn’t get that. Not even close. So naturally the distribution is a concern. News like this is a good thing because it is an improvement on the current situation and reduces the chance of a substantial 3rd wave.

The next issue is public behavior with people. This is things like people not wearing masks, having their face dicks hanging out, masks coving their chins, gatherings, or overall refusals to acknowledge the virus as a serious public health concern. This also contributes to vaccination hesitancy.

Combine the two there is certainly a risk of a “3rd wave” but it’s not because of the vaccine itself. It’s because the current administration is trying to correct the failures of the last. There are also way too many people, even though we’ve had 100 years of science and medical advancement since the last significant global pandemic, that still want to be morons and conspiracy retards.

[],,valleyofsmoke,,,,,,[],"“The news about the vaccines continues to be excellent — and the public discussion of it continues to be more negative than the facts warrant.

Here’s the key fact: All five vaccines with public results have eliminated Covid-19 deaths. They have also drastically reduced hospitalizations. “They’re all good trial results,” Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, told me. “It’s great news.”

Many people are instead focusing on relatively minor differences among the vaccine results and wrongly assuming that those differences mean that some vaccines won’t prevent serious illnesses. It’s still too early to be sure, because a few of the vaccine makers have released only a small amount of data. But the available data is very encouraging — including about the vaccines’ effect on the virus’s variants.

“The vaccines are poised to deliver what people so desperately want: an end, however protracted, to this pandemic,” as Julia Marcus of Harvard Medical School recently wrote in The Atlantic.

What do we care about?
In the official language of research science, a vaccine is typically considered effective only if it prevents people from coming down with any degree of illness. With a disease that’s always or usually horrible, like ebola or rabies, that definition is also the most meaningful one.

But it’s not the most meaningful definition for most coronavirus infections.

Whether you realize it or not, you have almost certainly had a coronavirus. Coronaviruses have been circulating for decades if not centuries, and they’re often mild. The common cold can be a coronavirus. The world isn’t going to eliminate coronaviruses — or this particular one, known as SARS-CoV-2 — anytime soon.

Yet we don’t need to eliminate it for life to return to normal. We instead need to downgrade it from a deadly pandemic to a normal virus. Once that happens, adults can go back to work, and children back to school. Grandparents can nuzzle their grandchildren, and you can meet your friends at a restaurant. As Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told me this weekend: “I don’t actually care about infections. I care about hospitalizations and deaths and long-term complications.”
The data
By those measures, all five of the vaccines — from Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax and Johnson &amp; Johnson — look extremely good. Of the roughly 75,000 people who have received one of the five in a research trial, not a single person has died from Covid, and only a few people appear to have been hospitalized. None have remained hospitalized 28 days after receiving a shot.

To put that in perspective, it helps to think about what Covid has done so far to a representative group of 75,000 American adults: It has killed roughly 150 of them and sent several hundred more to the hospital. The vaccines reduce those numbers to zero and nearly zero, based on the research trials.

Zero isn’t even the most relevant benchmark. A typical U.S. flu season kills between five and 15 out of every 75,000 adults and hospitalizes more than 100 of them. I assume you would agree that any vaccine that transforms Covid into something much milder than a typical flu deserves to be called effective. But that is not the scientific definition. When you read that the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine was 66 percent effective or that the Novavax vaccine was 89 percent effective, those numbers are referring to the prevention of all illness. They count mild symptoms as a failure.

The variants
What about the highly contagious new virus variants that have emerged in Britain, Brazil and South Africa? The South African variant does appear to make the vaccines less effective at eliminating infections.

Fortunately, there is no evidence yet that it increases deaths among vaccinated people. Two of the five vaccines — from Johnson &amp; Johnson and Novavax — have reported some results from South Africa, and none of the people there who received a vaccine died of Covid. “People are still not getting serious illness. They’re still not dying,” Dr. Rebecca Wurtz of the University of Minnesota School of Public Health told me. The most likely reason, epidemiologists say, is that the vaccines still provide considerable protection against the variant, albeit not quite as much as against the original version. Some protection appears to be enough to turn this coronavirus into a fairly normal disease in the vast majority of cases.

“This variant is clearly making it a little tougher to get the most vigorous response that you would want to have,” Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said. “But still, for severe disease, it’s looking really good.”What would an expert do?
The biggest caveat is the possibility that future data will be less heartening. Johnson &amp; Johnson and Novavax, for example, have issued press releases about their data, but no independent group has yet released an analysis. It will also be important to see much more data about how the vaccines interact with the variants. But don’t confuse uncertainty with bad news. The available vaccine evidence is nearly as positive as it could conceivably be. And our overly negative interpretation of it is causing real problems.

Some people worry that schools cannot reopen even after teachers are vaccinated. Others are left with the mistaken impression that only the two vaccines with the highest official effectiveness rates — from Moderna and Pfizer — are worth getting.

In truth, so long as the data holds up, any of the five vaccines can save your life.

Last week, Dr. William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University told my colleague Denise Grady about a conversation he had with other experts. During it, they imagined that a close relative had to choose between getting the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine now or waiting three weeks to get the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine. “All of us said, ‘Get the one tomorrow,’” Schaffner said. “The virus is bad. You’re risking three more weeks of exposure as opposed to getting protection tomorrow.”",,,1612235760,{},glork02,False,t3_laijnf,False,False,t3_laijnf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/laijnf/good_vaccine_news_the_vaccine_news_continues_to/glork02/,1612553876,70,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_4s5rn,False,False,,

Looking at the numbers coming out of Israel, this backs it up with real life data.

It makes sense because for the vast majority of vaccines there’s always a gap of a couple of months (for example for Hep B) so your body can make enough antibodies before you get the 2nd shot. The reason it just hasn’t been proven in most clinical studies for the current vaccines is because the trials would’ve taken much and much longer if they had to keep a gap of 3 months between first and second dose. 

I think the U.K. govt is doing a great job spreading it out like this, it’ll allow the country to vaccinate a lot more vulnerable people really quickly.

Oxford used one only but that doesn't run in humans. All viral vectors were Adenovirus strains

[],,Salezec,,,,,,[],"But by your logic these clinically tested covid 19 vaccines shouldn't be able to give us any protection. The infection starts out in the lower respiratory tract (alveoli). SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelial cells of the this part of the lungs and replicates and spreads around. That causes different immune cells to arrive at the site, fight off the virus and then not have enough strength to defend us against bacteria and that causes bacterial lung infections or lung inflammation. 

Now, by your logic, seeing as you think antibodies produced via i.m. injection can't end up in the respiratory tract, antibodies produced could never bind to the virus before it enters alveolar cells. 

My question for you is how do you imagine then that these vaccines prevent disease? 

The truth is that IgG antibodies induced by these vaccines wind up in the respiratory tract and neutralize the virus before it enters alveolar cells. That prevents it from replicating and you can't detect it from a swab using RT-PCR. Now, sometimes vaccinated individuals develop a strong enough antibody response that it prevents virus entry completely. Sometimes they don't, but the amount of antibodies that they do develop helps them fight off the virus more quickly, sometimes by deploying cytotoxic T cells in the case viral entry into cells is more prominent.

You must be talking about a control measure to guarantee a manufacturer was abiding by their contract after they claimed to fail the delivery of millions of vaccines.

Basically EU is doubling down sourcing new pharmaceutical companies, because they can't count on USA and UK, since they both full vaccine nationalism in place. One by executive order, the order per contract design (to look good in the picture, only Trump is a rude that would ban vaccine exports, right?).

I'm curious to see the other way around: if a UK plant had production problems and EU refused to fulfill the UK vaccines because they want to vaccinate Europeans first. 

It's weird why there wasn't any altruism with the European made vaccines that are sent to UK, and Boris didn't say: ""oh no please do vaccine your population first, we will wait until you're finished then you can send us your surplus!""

[],,RytheGuy97,,,,,,[],"3 things:

1. Just because mask wearing is common in Asia doesn’t mean that that will happen in the western world. East and southeast Asian countries are generally considerably more collectivistic in their culture than western countries which likely leads to much higher mask-wearing compliance. I know that SARS wasn’t the start of mask-wearing in Asia but it sure did make it more prevalent, and one of the hardest hit countries with SARS was actually Canada, where I live. Nobody wore masks anywhere pre-covid in Canada except if you were on the job as a health care worker. Do people have this idea in their heads that Asia is the only place that has dealt with pandemics and epidemics in the past? Because the western world has dealt with pandemics and epidemics such as the Spanish flu, Asian flu, Hong Kong flu, swine flu, SARS, and now covid and mask-wearing never because a mainstream thing. There will likely be nutjobs who won’t take the mask off and get mad at people for not wearing masks on busses and in stores from now on, but that’s always going to be a small minority of people.

You have to take culture into account. What people are doing in one country doesn’t by any means imply that people will do it in another. 

2. I can’t speak for all of Asia but my personal experience from the ~4 months I spent in Southeast Asia was that people only really tend to wear masks when their riding their motorbikes. I mean some people were wearing it while walking down the street I suppose but I kind of chalked that up to Saigon and Hanoi being very, very smoggy. When people entered malls and buildings they’d usually put their masks down over their chin or take it off altogether. This was mostly in Vietnam too - I don’t remember people in Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, or malaysia wearing masks that much at all. I know you have more experience in this being Asian yourself but I feel like a lot of westerners on this sub have this idea that Asian people were masking up as much as we all are now (so basically all the time) and that’s just not the case. 

3. I know it seems noble to “mask up when you have symptoms so you don’t get other people sick” but I have two issues with this that people seem to gloss over entirely - first, masks are really, really annoying and it’s unreasonable to expect people to mask up at the first sign of trouble, because your cough that might be a cold could also just be asthma, among other things. Having a runny nose might mean that you’re sick, but it’s also very possible it’s because of allergies or cold weather irritating your nose. Second, I think we should recognize that getting sick, unless you’re already immunocompromised or it’s a serious illness, is probably a good thing. You need to build up your immune system so that you get sick less later on and when you do get sick, it won’t be as bad. If everyone is wearing masks, yes you’ll probably get sick much less, but when you do get sick (which is inevitable unless you never leave your house), it’s going to be that much more unpleasant. In the case of swine flu, the disease disproportionally hit younger people because older people had more exposure to flu strains in the past and their immune systems could deal with it better. So if you go your entire life barely getting sick, when you inevitably do get sick, it’s likely to be much worse. So we can either deal with that, or accept that the cold and the flu are just a part of our lives and are almost never serious. 

TLDR: Cultural differences can lead to differences in mask compliance, Asian countries don’t wear masks as frequently in normal times as people think they do (in my experience), and wearing masks to keep people from getting sick from normal disease isn’t the unambiguously positive thing people think it is.",,,1612305037,{},glshq0t,False,t3_laqonv,False,False,t1_glsctn4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/laqonv/daily_discussion_thread_february_02_2021/glshq0t/,1612621183,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_mcg56,False,False,,

My grandmother is 90 years old and has been in a home for the last several years. She received the Pfizer vaccine last month, though she doesn’t understand why. A nursing home is where people who have lived too long go to die, without any hope of ever improving. The patients are all out of their mind — my grandma was always confused about whether I was her son or grandson, the other residents always aired various conspiracy theories and escape plans involving electricity and swapping their brains with dogs, and I was once attacked by another resident who mistakenly thought I had entered with three children and was leaving with two and she accused me of murdering the third child. Just being there for an hour would make me question my mental health. I can’t imagine actually working there all day every day.

It’s great that we’re vaccinating the nursing home residents. COVID is a very unpleasant death, and they deserve a less painful one. For the workers, they have a completely miserable hopeless job that can never pay adequately because 99% of people who live long enough to require nursing home care have no retirement money left to pay for it.

mRNA-in-lipids and adenovirus vaccines operate in exactly the same way, just manufactured differently; they present the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins on the surface of a blob of fatty lipids. The only difference between them is that the mRNA ones use artificially made lipid cell structures whilst the adenovirus ones use a weaker, inactivated (the code to reproduce removed) virus as a carrier: both of them still carry (at least a portion of) the RNA of the virus they're targeting.

The presence of the spike proteins is what your immune system notices, and it adapts to producing more antigens that will bind to the shape of _those spike proteins_. The inactivated viral vector being used is much of a muchness.

We have adenovirus influenza vaccines, it's been used thoroughly to vaccinate against Ebola, not once in the Green Book does it say that either vaccine is a contraindication to having other vaccines.

[],,Disastrous_Security5,,,,,,[],"Thank you for saying this. I’m actually a cna (post acute care, but got stuck on a long term care unit) I defended the vaccine to my coworkers and had some good one on one convos with them about it. Everyone on my shift got vaccinated. Studies show that one on one conversations like that do more to combat vaccine hesitancy than threatening people with consequences. I was psyched for the shot and I made sure everyone around me knew I was elated to get it too. I still wear the I got covid vaccinated sticker on my badge right next to my flu shot one. 

It’s a thankless job and if you required everyone to be vaccinated, then we’d go under. We’re running nearly constantly understaffed and so many people have quit. I took the job because I hated sales and office work, but I’m already looking into getting out ASAP. Mistrust of the medical establishment among women and minorities is real and for a reason, traditionally we have gotten the shit end of the stick. Being experimented on and receiving dangerous treatments wouldn’t surprise anyone of my coworkers who have been reusing n95 masks for a year. Since the fact we still have to reuse ppe shows no one gives a fuck about us. And guess what grandma wouldn’t have anyone helping her get thru her hip surgery recovery without us. 

So to the people of this sub, instead of yelling “you shouldn’t be in healthcare then!” to a bunch of people society and my facility has been calling “heroes” while treating us like trash for nearly a year in leu of paying us for the very real danger we’ve been put in because god forbid we actually have a real shut down, you can shove it up your ass. I hate anti-vacciners too! But instead of vilifying hard working poor people maybe complain more about how truly broken our education system is that people who come out of it fundamentally do not understand science or scientific research. Ask any RN and they will tell you CNA’s are the backbone of our healthcare system. And this is one who is tired of being shit on when I come home everyday with sore feet and cry sometimes about the lonely patients that just want to see their families again.

***Does this information provide evidence that the latest shut-down worked???***

* There is increasing evidence that California's latest stay-at-home order worked to turn around a deadly surge of the coronavirus.
* The orders prohibited nonessential travel; banned outdoor social gatherings; and **closed outdoor dining**, nail and hair salons, and museums.
* Within roughly two weeks of the new stay-at-home orders in late November, the county began to turn the corner.  In early December, Californians began moving around their communities at a rate 40% lower than what is typical — the lowest level since May
* In Los Angeles County, the stay-at-home orders and a ban on outdoor dining were **followed by a drop in the transmission rate — a measure known as ""R"" that reflects how many people a sick person on average infects — from 1.2 before the orders to 0.85 by early January.** Anything above 1.0 means an outbreak will grow exponentially.
* California officials estimated that the state's order kept as many as 25,000 people from landing in the hospital with a severe case of COVID-19.
* California's COVID-19 death rate ranks 33rd among the 50 states. Had California had the same death rate as Arizona — which has refused a statewide mask mandate and allows indoor dining and service at bars — its death toll would be more than 73,000.",,,1612254662,{},glpk45k,False,t3_laqonv,False,True,t3_laqonv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/laqonv/daily_discussion_thread_february_02_2021/glpk45k/,1612568491,-3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_ar0hy,False,False,,

[],,karmaStrikesBack,,,,,,[],"Technically you are correct, but I dont think you understand the whole evolutionary pressure context and therefore make wrong general conclusions. Let me explain.

Viruses and bacteria mutate all the time. Bacteria usually mutate less often, because they have DNA - double stranded helix with self fixing properties (so it is basically 2 copies of genetic information that prevents any mistakes during copying, kinda like having 2 hard drives in RAID 1), viruses usually have RNA, which is only a single chain of genetic information, usually without any ability to fix mistakes (mutations). Even though the mutation rate of some viruses like covid is considered less often, the fact that there are trillions of viral particles in the world means mutations happen many times a second.

So covid is mutating all the time around, we have documented over 12 thousand different covid mutations. BUT, it is extremely unlikely for the mutation to be beneficial for the virus. 99.999...9% of mutations ""break"" the virus and it dies and disappears. Kinda like in humans, how many genetic mutations do you know that are positive for the human, and how many become genetic diseases....). So at the beginning there was one strain of covid virus in a bat, that thanks to a positive mutation was able to infect humans. So in late 2019 this strain started infected other people and kept mutating. As I said most mutations gave the virus disadvantages so they died off. But rarely some mutations give the virus benefits, like being able to more quickly enter cells, longer incubation period, higher chance of causing asymptomatic cases, increase shedding and therefore viral load a person caughs out, etc... Those mutations then do better in the world than the old strain, and become a dominant strain in the area thanks to evolutionary pressure. And these continue mutating and so on and so on...

So you question is kinda not correct, it sounds like you assume the virus cannot mutate into stronger strains indefinitely. But the truth is of course it can and it does. The UK or South African variants keep mutating as we speak, and sooner or later there will emerge a more dangerous mutated form of these virus that will again lower the efficacy of the vaccines and natural protection of people who already had the original covid strain. That is why it is important to quickly and globally vaccinate the whole world, because we have a huge number of viral particles in the world, each able to mutate into a strain able to resist vaccines and previous natural immunity. 

Even now it looks like the new variants lower vaccine efficiency by about 10%, so 10% of vaccinated people can still get sick. That is huge. And if we give the virus time and people (or animals, remember Denmakr's minks?) as hosts to mutate, it will keep becoming more infectious and people will be infected much easier, increasing the exponencial curve of spread. AND it does not necessarily mean the new strains will be less deadly, virus only cares about infecting as many people as it can, if it can infect twice as many people, it does not care if it already kills twice as many people. So talking about the virus becoming weaker are false, generally if the virus is less deadly, it infect more people, but if for example any mutation makes it infect twice as many people, it will become the dominant strain even if it kill 20% more people.",,,1612260112,{},glpq3vh,False,t3_l97t6x,False,True,t1_glkgjzu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l97t6x/daily_discussion_thread_january_31_2021/glpq3vh/,1612571407,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_10g025,False,False,,

The answer is really fundamental... just because it's a virus doesn't mean its similar..

And Ebola is even farther apart since it's not a respiratory illness and it's only transmitted via bodily fluids (so yes, clean surfaces when dealing with Ebola); but on the other end, masks are not as important compared to COVID-19 in terms of a transmission means (but almost as or more important given Ebola is a much worse disease if you catch it). 

Your question can also be phrased: Why the masks? The previous coronaviruses (SARS, MERS) weren't as transmissible via the air. 

Each should be reviewed on it's own when the data comes it....

Only when there is an outbreak in one state and other states decide that allowing travellers from the hot zones are a risk.

&gt;There is simply no way you were going to have national lockdown in the United States.

Australia and the USA has a similar federation system where the federal government has little powers when it comes to public health. This fells on the responsibility of the states. What happens in Australia are the state governments unilaterally decide that they will be serious and go pedal to the metal with the lockdowns and do it seriously. The states decide if and when lockdowns are imposed and state borders are opened and closed. The national/federal government actually intended to do nothing.

After the state governments decided to be serious, the federal government had no choice but to go along and support the effort with unlimited money printing with schemes like JobSeeker and JobKeeper.

So a federation system like the USA should not be a hindrance if the states themselves are serious. However, they are not, so ...

Unemployment payments alone are going to be in the multi billion range, never mind the stimulus checks, housing relief, etc. 

The cost to the economy is massively more, as is the lost tax revenue.

So yes, at any remotely plausible price any investment that speeds up reopening by weeks, much less months or quarters, pays for itself.

Plus, you can use that infrastructure for other things afterwards, it’s not like it goes away. Given how promising mRNA vaccines are, I highly doubt any production capacity there will be wasted.

You still get a vaccine because masks work, but aren't perfect. You still get a vaccine because looking at this simply as mask vs no mask is simplistic and is really only about making a point, not actually talking seriously about the issue. It isn't mask or no mask. It is mask here and not there. If you and your friends are vaccinated and you're hanging out at your house, that's no mask. You get the vaccine so doing that is safer. If you are going to a shop, that is a mask situation. The vaccine for now is progress towards no rules.

I'd like you to elaborate on these million drawbacks of wearing a mask while you watch a movie or shop in a store. Please show me your mountain of scientific evidence this poses some meaningful danger to you. I've been wearing one since we started doing that, maybe I'm no longer functioning well enough to know what you are hinting at here.

Appealing to people agreeing with you on something like this is not really something that you need to do. We've had people doing a lot of ridiculous stuff.

That's what made this virus so bad, it's mostly killed older people, not everyone else, and doesn't seem like much at first. Or anything at all in many cases. You don't think you're sick, get the wrong person infected, they don't know they're sick, then it takes a few weeks to kill them. 

But to think that it's just going to keep working it's way through populations and slaying them when I ALSO remember hearing how this particular coronavirus doesn't mutate very quickly or very well, is... well it goes against everything the same experts were saying about why quickly developed vaccines would do a great job at putting a stop to this. So far, that appears to be the case.

Are we supposed to ignore all evidence that the virus is starting to die out? Israel? The U.K. and U.S. having a peak around June 8th and dropping ever since? Far fewer nursing home deaths in the last week or so?

""People are buying sheds to work in because working at home is so hard and they really miss the office life.""

And the hidden subtle message:

""Come on guys, wasn't office life great. Don't you miss it? Look at all these ways it's bad for people working from home.""

One quote from the article:

""And occupational psychologists agree. Dr Chiara Amati says it is healthy to have a degree of separation between home and work. That explains why some people, even those who hated their commute, now miss those hours spent in traffic or on the train, which psychologists call a ""boundary activity"" because it puts space between work and leisure time.""

Like really? How many of us really do miss spening 2.5 hours a day commuting stuck in traffic or rammed in to a busy commuter train? Am I really the exception and most of you just can't wait to suffocate amidst angry pushing and shoving commuters?

It's not so much that, sure, many people do prob miss the office life. Maybe some even miss the commute. But rather that it's always these same kind of ""Wasn't the office life great"" themed articles I'm seeing. I can't recall ever reading an article about how working from home helped someone. How it, as in my case, has improved my health. How I absolutely do not, even a tiny ounce, miss 2.5 hours a day commuting and rarely have time during the weekday evenings to do anything. I don't recall once reading an article in mainstream media asking the question, ""Could we look at ways to make this a more permanent arrangement for those that prefer it?"" It's always, ""Mental health is sfuffering. Domestic abuse is up. The economy can't cope. No one likes working from home. Come on guys, commuting was fun. People who say otherwise should be looked down on and admonished.""

""what a bad year"" it was and how everyone had a tough time. But a lot of people fail to see what exactly made it bad. The virus ? Not really.  


You will find out how this virus is just a thing from nature here to stay and even in 10 years from now, one of you reading this may experiece a death of a close one due to the same COVID-19 we have now. But that's something to stay with us, just like a lot of people experience the pain of having a loved one diagnosed with cancer. So the thing that really made 2020 suck wasn't the virus, wasn't the illnesses, wasn't health in any way. It was the constant fear and lockdowns. The constant feeling that you are in danger or that you propell danger. This was spread by governments, by media and then when it became effective enough it became spread by you, the people. We started blaming, we started criticising and doubting, because someone might have not been made aware of the recent ""turn of events"" made from governments that introduce new restrictions, new laws, make new people criminals.  


So in conclusion to what I'm trying to say, 2020 was a very shit year. But not because we had a new virus emerge. 2020 was a shit year because governments and media abused lockdowns, infected pretty much the whole globe with fear and turned people against each other.

The company has announced that they want to soon apply for CMA at the EMA, although the EMA hasn't announced anything yet.

Now I'm curious about the Chinese vaccines. Sinovac and one of Sinopharm's vaccines haven't published their Phase III reports yet although the ministries that approved them apparently already have interim reports, just not published. I'm not sure about the timetable of publication or data finalization, I'm hoping sooner than later.

Either way, all of them have been in the process of WHO EUL/PQ though, the committee has estimated they will announce the results for Sinopharm and Sinovac in March at the earliest so maybe they are waiting for final data reports as well:

While at the same time still delivering in full to the UK. Now if both production lines were completely separate, this could have been sort of ok. But the AZ contract with the EU states the UK production factories are part of the production line for the EU itself. Plus, there was worry about vaccines having been transferred from EU factories to the UK before. All in all, al lot of complicated legal stuff that still hasn't been figured out yet. A 60% reduction in deliveries, mentioned out of the blue a few weeks before said deliveries are supposed to take place, is not a normal manufacturing delay. And obviously gave enormous pressure on the EU committee to look into this.

As a reaction, the EU ""lashed out"" at AZ and now imposed an export check. Check, not block, not stealing either. Meaning that any vaccine exports from factories on EU soil, now first need to be approved before they can happen. So the EU has a much better tool to make sure no vaccine companies are using their tax-subsidised factories to make more profit elsewhere. So far it hasn't blocked any exports yet, not even to the UK. As a response AZ found 9 mln more doses for Q1. So I'd say all's good that ends (sort of) good.

BioNtech/Pfizer production is being massively ramped up at the moment in the EU. A new plant opened already in Germany, also causing some delays in delivery.

America can be seen as a success story because even with all the shit that went down last month, all rationale thinkers knew that nothing was actually going to happen. We consistently have people freely speaking their mind on how they disagree with the government, in fact in 2020 it was the thing to do, all without fear of undue recourse. When we see that undue recourse, people are actually able to make a better life for themselves: See fauci and Cohen post t rump, both are doing better today then they did before trump disparaged them.

&gt;In the past week, the number of corona infections decreased by 20 percent to 28,628, according to the RIVM.  Fewer people were tested, so that the percentage of positive tests hardly decreased: from 11.7 to 11.4 percent.  The RIVM states that the epidemic would be heading in the right direction, were it not for the fact that new, more contagious variants of the virus ""throw a spanner in the works"".

&gt;Based on models, the institute estimates that two thirds of the infections are now the variant that is causing great pressure on hospitals in Great Britain and Ireland.  For several weeks now there have actually been two epidemics in the Netherlands, with different characteristics.

&gt;In addition to the British, three other variants of the virus have been found in the Netherlands: the South African (now found 23 times in the Netherlands) and two Brazilian (found twice).

&gt;Those new variants have a higher reproduction number;  according to the latest calculations, the British have an 'R' of 1.28.  That means that 100 people with corona infect 128 others.

&gt;_Combined 'R'_

&gt;Combined with a lower reproduction number for the classic variant, the RIVM comes to a combined 'R' for all variants of 0.97 on 15 January;  only just under 1.  With a reproduction number below 1, the number of sick people decreases.

&gt;Although the number of infections found has decreased in recent weeks, with 164 infections per 100 inhabitants, the Netherlands is still in the ""serious phase"" of the epidemic, according to the RIVM.

[],,atealein,,,,,,[],"*Here is the new update from* Sweden **(2021-02-02, Tuesday):**

*Following the holidays, the number updates are on Tuesday-Friday's and press-briefings on Tuesdays and Thursdays.* *Last reported numbers at a glance Friday - 566957 (+2400) confirmed cases and 11591 (+71) deaths*

* Numbers at a glance (previously in the post title): 576606 (+9649) confirmed cases and 11815 (+224) deaths 
* 14-day incidence rate in Sweden is now 420 per 100.000. This is continuous decrease that is maybe starting to slow down a bit, last Tuesday and Thursday it was 479 and 443 respectively. All age groups continue to show decrease, sharpest in 20-59, which has dropped from 600 to below 300 per 100.000 weekly incidence rate in the last four weeks.
* Skåne's new confirmed cases curve is showing definitive downturn, the region is still with 657 per 100.000 14-day incidence which is about 1.5x higher than the national average. Similar development is seen in the nearby regions around it. Västra Götaland is slightly above the national average with 493 per 100.000 but also showing definitive donward turn. Stockholm's decrease has now stopped and the new confirmed cases have been at a similar level for the last three weeks, with incidence rate of 300 per 100.000. 
* The decrease in the new ICU admissions is continuing, and last week it was the first week with less than 100 ICU new admissions since end of October. 
* After 4 weeks with really high death rates from middle of December onwards (51-53 and 1) when the weekly deaths were over 630, week 2, which is now mostly complete gives hope for a downward turn of the previous plateau (it is currently at 570, might increase to 600 still). The large lag in reporting from December has started to go down sharply ( from close to 3x the normal reporting period, it is now less than 2x ), which means that there is still about 20 days to report 90% of the deaths that occurred on a certain date, compared to previous average of 11 days prior to November when it increased to an average of 17. 
*  In four regions there was a new way of testing in week 4 for part of the new confirmed cases there - 2200 positive tests were tested for match with the brittish variant and preliminary results find 11% of them (about 250 people) as positive. This isn't a full sequencing but some new method  to identify if samples belong to a variant. The brittish variant is now in Sweden and it is likely that it will take over and dominate the proportion of newly infected. However, this does not necessarily mean that there will be more cases of infection. 
* FHM is recommending that Astra Zeneca's vaccine is given only to people below 65 years old due to the lack of documentation for the effectiveness in higher age groups. 
* About 1505 are the patients in hospital care with COVID-19 (excluding ICU), a decrease by 200 compared to a week ago. 247 is the number of today's ICU patients with COVID-19, decrease by 30 compared to last week. 700 is the total ICU capacity of beds with respirator (this number is decreasing now, but it is still about 200 more than the normal capacity pre-pandemic), there is about 23% free capacity. The free capacity varies a lot between regions and there is preparedness to transport patients if needed.

====

**Please, remember there is lag in reporting and deaths reported on a certain day are usually mostly deaths that happened on previous days. On average it takes up to 11 days to report 90% of the deaths for a certain day (see in the links graphs about how that looks);** ***with the current holidays this lag has more than doubled.***

Covid is considered quite slow mutator, so if you take a million covid viruses and a million of seasonal flu viruses, the flu viruses will be able to mutate and overcome vaccines much quicker. BUT, if you compare a trillion covid viruses versus million flu viruses, covid will mutate and become resistent to vaccines much quicker. And that is the MAJOR problem we are facing right now, there are sooo many covid viral particles in the world that the total mutation rate is uncomfortably fast (if as many people who have covid in the world right now had seasonal flu, which mutates quicker, it could literarly become vaccine resistent in a day, you would not be able to vaccinate people because new variants would emerge so quickly...), and actually covid could mutate  so fast that a new stronger variant that lowers vaccine efficiency could emerge every month or even quicker, so if we drag the vaccination program for months and years, vaccines could become useless and we would have to start from scratch, so it is important to vaccinate quickly to lower the amount of viral particles down enough so that the overall mutation rate is not enough to produce vaccine resistant strains in near future.",,,1612283336,{},glqy3zt,False,t3_l97t6x,False,True,t1_glqugi8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/l97t6x/daily_discussion_thread_january_31_2021/glqy3zt/,1612591869,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_10g025,False,False,,

CDC recommends an annual flu vaccine for everyone 6 months and older. Annual flu vaccination varies in how well it works, but it is the best available way to prevent flu and its potentially serious consequences.

&gt;The study was conducted over four flu seasons from 2012 to 2015 and found that flu vaccination prevented severe disease:

&gt;Flu vaccination among adults reduced the risk of being admitted to the hospital with flu and placed in a general ward bed by 37 percent.
Flu vaccination was even more effective in preventing the most severe forms of flu and reduced the risk of being admitted to an ICU with flu by 82 percent.

You lock down hard and crush the curve. Then you open up slowly and gradually. And then you keep everything in check through contact tracing and masks.

The problem is that this didn't actually work in most places, which couldn't crush the curve low enough, and couldn't keep the virus in check no matter what they did after the summer was over. 

*If* this had worked, then DeSantis would look like a goon. But since it didn't, his strategy was really much closer to the way experts advised people to handle a pandemic before 2020: keep as much of normal life as possible while trying to avoid uncontrolled outbreaks and overwhelmed hospitals. This produced no worse results, and better/more sustainable quality of life.

Now, I think one reason Florida's results have been OK is that they already had a lot of measures in place to protect elderly people from respiratory diseases -- they have to, with as many elderly people as they do. And of course cities can be more ""closed"" than the state as a whole.

What's the excuse after the first wave?

&gt;Some stupid politicians sucked up to Macron because he was trying to get a French pharma firm (Sanofi) a piece of the action and their vaccine utterly failed. So we're low on vaccination supply and at least in Germany, we've got a clusterfuck of individual state level politicians in charge of medical policies and they're all doing they're own thing.

Such a shame.  I really hope things speed up for you guys in the EU soon though!!  It's crazy to see nations that have seen so many deaths are also being slow to rollout the vaccine.

Many places waited a very long time to open, trying to see if the lockdown could get cases as low as the experts wanted them. They opened up, in many cases, because they had to or because social distancing had broken down (as we saw from the protests in the U.S.) And places that opened late, like California, didn't do any better than states that opened early, and often worse.

Contact tracing only works when case levels are very low; everyone has to abandon it as soon as they rise too high. But during the summer, most countries *thought* contact tracing and masks were keeping things in check, and didn't realize it was just the weather, and didn't really prepare for the inevitable second wave.

[],,CapinWinky,,,,,,[],"The advice is to open schools for elementary aged children and children with special needs. I'm referring specifically to the advice from a multi-disciplinary panel in NY that expanded and elaborated on CDC guidelines. It also stipulates safety measures in place that no school is prepared to follow. So if you're talking about following their advice to open schools, it's already moot because schools cannot follow their safety guidelines and certainly can't make the HVAC improvements they recommend.

The idea is that the toll from Covid will be less than that of not having schools open, of which the education is only a small part of the picture. Essentially, they're acknowledging that they will lose children to covid, they think they are losing more than that to domestic violence increases and hunger. The child care may also improve the economy, reducing deaths due to poverty.

I worry the panel's calculous is off. Current mortality rate for K-12 students is 7.5 per 100k confirmed cases. About 5% of Florida k-12 students have had confirmed covid infections, that will at least double by the end of the year, so we'll call it a conservative estimate that 10% of students will get the virus. There are 50 million students, so you can expect that 5 million will be infected and of those 375 will die. That amount could be offset by the benefits of kids in schools.

BUT, what if it's all 50 million that get covid? Then we're talking 3,750 will die. What if the lung and pulmonary damage from covid is permanent and life altering/shortening? Are we okay with a generation of kids that die in their 40s and 50s from heart failure or require oxygen to survive, like polio kids a few generations back? What about teachers?

Let me just put it this way, say you’re wearing a mask and hypothetically, you have the virus but you don’t know it. Let’s also say you’re outdoors. If you use a surgical/cloth mask, some of your breath will go directly into the mask. That way, lots of virus particles are collected on your face and on your mask from the inside. If you take off your mask for any reason and touch it/your face, your hands will become contaminated. If you handshake someone, you will be transmitting the virus particles on your hand to him/her. Then if he/she touches their face, then he/she will have the virus and it will enter in somehow.

This has been used for over 100 years, and there may be more modern (and hopefully better) methods that my old fashioned mind is unaware of. 

The 'infectious dose' has, to my knowledge, only been studied in animal models. The ethical dilemmas with human subjects preclude human studies. Of course human experimentation has been done historically. The classic horror story is the Nazis, but similar medical atrocities have happened in the USA and China though they haven't been connected to our present situation.  The only dishonest example that comes immediately to mind is [the incident in India](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00145-8/fulltext) where poor people from the area of Bhopal (as if they haven't suffered enough) were used as guinea pigs for a vaccine trial **without being informed it was a trial and that  they might receive a placebo**. This is a step down from deliberately inoculating humans with virus, but it is still unethical. There are probably other incidents in other countries both current and, especially, historical, but these three countries come to mind.

So, the infectious dose has to be extrapolated from animals. This, of course, has its limitations, but its what we have to do. The experimenters who do this work have a very good handle on the doses they use, usually in something like particle/cm^3. 

As to the 'how much of a surface question' everyone working on such things has to routinely report the surface area they are testing, and this is for obvious reasons. It's *always* done. It wouldn't be useful science otherwise. 

As to repeated touches this has to be looked at in the light of both persistence of infectivity on said surface, and, perhaps most importantly, how much of a given concentration of virus particles is removed from a given surface by each touch. Let's take an example. Suppose that X equals the number of virions per square centimeter. Further suppose that you have a very compliant but rather weak minded volunteer who puts his or her finger down and immediately sticks it up their nose and breathes in. Suppose that each touch pulls off 50% of the virions. The summation (Σ) of the virions transferred is Σ = (x/50)... (x/100)... (x/200).... (x/∞). With repeated touching you will approach 100% but never actually get to it. By iteration 5 you are down to the level where only 1.56% of the concentration is picked up, and it's rapidly downhill from there. It has to be kept in mind that there is no assistant quickly dumping on more virus between each touch. 

With the 'disinfection' methods that have become standard practice it is an open question whether any protection gained is from actually inactivating virus. How much is due to simply washing and wiping the virus away. It would be interesting research to do the comparison of alcohol wipes versus water soaked fabric. Some products have been tested in terms of the 'contact time' needed to kill the virus (between 3 and 10 minutes generally). So the area has to remain *wet* for that time. Spraying a counter and immediately wiping may do close to nothing beyond the physical effects of the wipe.",,,1612300663,{},gls6rc3,True,t3_lac4t2,False,True,t1_glrh5m7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lac4t2/covid19_rarely_spreads_through_surfaces_so_why/gls6rc3/,1612615429,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_3yb2p,False,False,,

What is really troubling about this, is that I had just read a blog the other day from someone about how if the SA/BR variant picks up the deletions in the spike from the UK variant, we would need an entirely new vaccine to work. Low and behold, all it is missing is the K417N/T gene. 

But another similarly worse gene that this variant can pick up is the N439K gene which binds to human ACE2 at twice the rate. Aiding the N501Y in another 50% increase in virulence to humans.

We are not making masks a permanent staple in our lives post COVID because the added utility of wearing a facial covering to protect a tiny sliver of people who CAN'T get vaccinated will be no greater than it was pre-pandemic. Ignoring the fact that I am only talking about a period after the vast majority of people are vaccinated and community spread has been brought down to extremely low levels, the absolute number of people who who would be at risk from severe COVID would likely me marginally larger than the number of people at risk from other latent viruses in circulation.

Wearing a mask isn't an ""unbearable burden"" it is an inconvenience that i gladly put up with to protect others because there is a large risk to public health currently. Once there is no longer an abnormally large risk to public health beyond a small subsection of the population the benefit of me wearing a mask is no longer enough to justify doing it all the time.

[],,P0L1Z1STENS0HN,,,,,,[],"&gt;In other words, I'm not talking about the risk to an individual but to the healthcare system.

If you have 1000 vaccines at your disposal, to mitigate risk to the health care system, you cannot just jab 1000 people from an arbitrarily chosen group that is the largest in absolute numbers. That is statistics 101. And the age group 55-70 is arbitrarily chosen, you could as well have 55-60, 60-65, 65-70 as three separate groups.

You have to ensure the vaccine goes to 1000 individuals who have the highest risk of clogging up the health care system. And if that are the people 85 and older, then you first vaccinate the people 85 and older.

That's why the first to be vaccinated in the UK, Margaret Keenan, was 90 when she received the jab (has turned 91 by now).

In the case of Finland, you tell me it's 75 and older, which may be totally fine depending on vaccine availability. It should probably depend on other factors than just age as well, for example convenience - putting all nursing home residents into a single category means the vaccination team only has to go into each nursing home once.

Depending on the daily available shots after that high-risk group is through, it may be totally fine to say ""first come first serve"", because you cannot say ""everyone age 63 has their jab in the week from May 7th to July 14th, and everyone age 62 has their jab in the week from May 15 to July 21st."" That works just as badly as making airplane passengers board ""window seats first, then middle seats, then aisle seats"". Expect many people to come in for jabs as a complete household.

As I said, the largest risk group in Germany is more than 40 million people and it is currently expected that it only takes three months to vaccinate them all. A day earlier or later for some slightly more at-risk person doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things there, especially during the summer months.",,,1612266413,{},glpxi8q,False,t3_las3wt,False,True,t1_glpv4hc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/las3wt/is_uk_the_only_country_in_europe_that_prioritizes/glpxi8q/,1612574939,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_tkaq7,False,False,,

While visibly sick people can pass on the virus, data cited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 40% to 45% of those infected never develop symptoms at all. With the new viral variants that can transmit more readily, the potential for silent spread is even higher, infectious-disease experts said.

Secondly, researchers now know that tiny airborne particles known as aerosols play a role in the spread of Covid-19. These can linger in the air and travel beyond 6 feet.""

""Yet in settings like offices, restaurants or gyms, the role of the barriers is murkier, because activities like talking loudly and breathing deeply create aerosols that can waft on air currents and get around shields.

Also, installing such barriers could affect airflow throughout the space, environmental-health experts said. **It is possible they could limit proper ventilation, making things worse**, they said.

“There seems to be an assumption that particles are going to get stopped by the barriers, which is simply not true,” said Lisa Brosseau, an industrial hygienist and research consultant for the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.

Because of the population I work with (students with IEPs), I've been back in person since August. I absolutely think schools should be the last thing to close, but a lot more work from people way higher up than me needs to be done. You can open schools, but you can't make parents send their kids in (which is completely understandable). Schools don't want to lose numbers so they compromise with a hybrid model. Let me just say, being asked to essentially teach kids in two different places is *exhausting*. Im basically doing 2 jobs for 1 paycheck. In a regular year, my job would involve traveling to different schools. Since that's obviously not happening now, my organization has decided teletherapy means they can completely fill every spare minute of my schedule. I'm teaching 8 periods a day straight through, when, in years past I've typically had 5. Since I work in reading intervention, I can't exactly teach 1 lesson 8 times, so planning takes even more time. The only reason I have a planning period is because I get to school at 6:30 am; some of my coworkers aren't as lucky. 

As I said before l, I've been in person since August, but won't be getting vaccinated any time soon. The rational part of me ""gets"" it, but the dichotomy of being esstential enough to be in person during a pandemic, but not essential enough to get vaccinated for said pandemic is kind of a bummer. Meanwhile, I'm seeing teacher friends who have been virtual this entire time (albeit in other states) get vaccinated. 

I didn't mean to go in a rant, but I've been thinking a lot about this; I'll stop now. I definitely don't think I'm better than grocery store workers (I've seen that one thrown around a lot). I've just never busted my ass this hard, to feel this demoralized :/

It will be relatively minimal, but I think it is part of a plan to get students more prepared for another scenario like this should it happen. Additionally, even before the pandemic, many districts already offered a “virtual academy” for students and parents who were interested. I could see that gain some popularity, but the reality is that there will always be a need for in person school. Keep in mind that the material being taught in classes is just one aspect of the school experience. Another big part of education is learning to interact with peers responsibly and developing positive relationships. Finally, while in school you may be told “what to do and when to do it” in the sense of what periods you have your classes, but many teachers, myself included, like to give students a bit more flexibility in what they do and when they do it. I may assign a few assignments for my students and then give them the choice of what to work on. I’ll typically allow them to decide what to do in class and what to do for homework (if they don’t finish in class). I’ll be there to help and guide them, but I like to give them more autonomy. Sometimes kids will waste the time and find that they have homework, other times kids will work diligently and find they don’t have homework. While history is the main focus of the material, I always try to help my students develop other skills to succeed. They will learn how to interact with peers/work as a team, how to manage their time, how to persevere through challenging assignments, and how there are consequences for actions (or inactions). These are the things I hope they develop and most remember, because they are applicable in so many areas of life.

Are the richest nations going to get vaccinated first? Yeah, probably.

The UK used emergency approval. The EU decided not too. This was not an attack on the UK but just a a statement of facts combined with a defense of the EU approach.

&gt;“Some countries started to vaccinate a little before Europe, it is true,” she said, asked about the UK. “But they resorted to emergency, 24-hour marketing authorisation procedures.

I never said that 😅. I said that it's dishonest to present that collaboration as if it benefited both parties *equally*. It's a way of salvaging AZ's low efficacy. I am glad they are working on that.

&gt;As for the vector yield, I'll post a source in a little, I only have non english one to hand. 

Okay. I really wanna see that.

&gt;All I am saying is you are talking about 62% number for two doses of AZ but that's not an accurate comparison. it's not right to compare to another vaccine with a lower efficacy bound with regimen that's not used 

But it absolutely is fair, because that's the only data we have and I am under the impression that it's the regiment that's been approved, definitely in the EU, but I believe in the UK as well. I absolutely cannot understand your refusal to accept that efficacy and the comparison with other vaccines.

But African-American acceptance of a potential COVID vaccine is substantially lower than other racial or ethnic groups, by some 30-40 points, even though they have suffered disproportionately from the pandemic. There is a history of medical distrust, with a number of real-world incidents like Tuskegee feeding into it. If the feeling is that they might be taken advantage of, having successful African-American athletes publicly take the vaccine might actually move the needle (not pun intended) a significant degree. Also, there are less than 500 NBA players total. That's less doses than have had to be discarded multiple times due to minor handling issues. From a functional standpoint, it's a drop in the bucket in terms of supply and could possible greatly increase vaccine uptake in disadvantaged communities. I think that substantially outweighs any ""fairness"" issues.

It seems we still have to wait for more efficacy data in older age groups, but this should come soon and there is nothing to indicate any substantially weaker results.

What I found very interesting is that the LD/SD regimen was confirmed to yield higher efficacy, though it is in part attributed to the longer dosing interval by the authors:

&gt;In our **interim analysis, we identified a higher efficacy in a subgroup analysis of those who received the LD/SD** regimen14. This finding is **confirmed in the current analysis**, but with further data available, we show that the enhanced immunogenicity and efficacy with this regimen **may be partly driven by the longer dosing interval that was a feature of this group**, further supporting the observation of a relationship between dose interval and efficacy in the SD/SD group discussed above and supported by emergency use authorisation.  The SD/SD regimen is preferred operationally as it is more straightforward to deliver a vaccine with one dosage, and because there are more immunogenicity and efficacy data to support its use.

Does that mean that technically the rollout could i**n general** (not limited to UK) be sped up even more by giving half the first dose to twice the number of people, but it is ruled out for operational reasons and lack of data (which are probably two good reasons)?",,,1612291654,{},glrju6f,False,t3_lb0eed,False,True,t3_lb0eed,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lb0eed/new_astrazeneca_study_data_vaccine_efficacy_after/glrju6f/,1612603194,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_89ta7ac3,False,False,,

It's so exhausting and confusing to read all of the positive news, article after article, saying vaccine rolloput is going great and getting better, death rates are beginning to plummet, the variants are maybe not as scary as we initially feared- all to hear Osterholm say that it really doesn't matter, we're all fucked anyways.

Phrases like ""COVID hell"" and ""category 5 hurricane"" are so emotionally charged and almost propaganda-like in nature; they just fill people with despair and fear. And let's not forget about how in November, he predicted that we'd see ""hospitals literally on the verge of collapse"" (direct quote!) within the next few months. 

And then after all the hopelessness and doom and gloom, this dude has the audacity to go on his podcast last week and tell some shitty story about a WWII general who refused to give up in the face of certain defeat and how that's a great example of how we also shouldn't give in, for some reason.

You don't get that from i.m. injections into the arm at all, this post is pretty decent:

https://www.virology.ws/2020/09/03/the-route-matters/

None of the flu vaccines produce sterilizing immunity, that requires a set of specific immune responses which existing vaccines do not produce:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5011745/

Nasal administration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine MIGHT produce sterilizing immunity (this is a bit better than that blog post above, but its technical):

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.10.331348v1.full

Most vaccines don't produce sterilizing immunity (don't have a good reference to this in the literature so this'll have to do, since scouring the literature isn't my day job):

https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-few-vaccines-prevent-infection-heres-why-thats-not-a-problem-152204

High NAbs in the bloodstream isn't sterilizing immunity.

As for ACE2+mucosal immunity not being possible, that's something off of a TWiV video awhile back that they bring up from time to time, I don't have any good references to that one.  The one of them that is more of a subject matter expert on that asserted it pretty strongly.  My understanding is that since there isn't ACE2 in those surfaces they won't get infected and won't have NAbs.  The virus will be able to enter the mucosal surfaces.  From there it will be able to find other tissues in the nose that will not have NAbs in them which do have ACE2 and infect them.  Then you'll get innate + T-cell responses in those tissues and inflammation and immune response to combat the disease, and NAbs in the bloodstream will prevent transmission to other tissues, but viral replication will happen.  Since the virus doesn't infect cells directly in the mucosal surfacs those cells never express the antigens on MHC and B-cell and NAbs responses never happen in the mucosal surfaces, even though the virus is swimming around there.  Clearly there's other experts who are hopeful that intranasal vaccination will produce sterilizing immunity though based on those papers I cited (they're biased though since they're pushing their nasal vaccine, and don't just assume people are automatically just like mice).  But also clearly stated in those papers none of the existing vaccines that are approved can produce sterilizing immunity and you're wrong that its just about NAbs titers in the blood.

Comparing this pandemic to the pre-2020s is not accurate. 1) there are a lot more health related issues revolving around diets than before leading to way higher chance of death 2) they couldn’t make vaccines at the rate we are or at all, so they had to live with it either way 3) SARS affects the hearts, lungs, and brain. Even with mild symptoms. Look up the original SARS studies, this one may be different in some ways but in a lot of ways it’s very similar in the overall outcome of those infected who live (if the ORF8 is deleted, you could be asymptomatic and spread the virus which then may add the ORF8 back which is associated with a more severe outcome). This is comparable to the Flu of 1918 but this is completely different virus. 

I think if you took any type of virology course or something such as medical microbiology you would understand the ramifications of just letting the virus do its thing.

You wrote ""J&amp;J is getting KILLED in the media and their stock is plummeting. Absolutely unfair.""  Agreed it would be unfair if true.  It is not getting KILLED in the media, and the stock price change is in the normal range if you follow the market at all.  If the stock dropped by $20, I wouldn't argue with you at all -- that would be ""plummeting"" -- or if it continued to drop over time, I wouldn't argue, but it is stable at $163.  In reality, $163 is where the the market puts the value right now &amp; it probably bumped up for two days in anticipation of the results with higher trading volume and their earnings call last week.  Full disclosure, I have a long position in JNJ &amp; I was not concerned in the least with the return to the level of support at $163; as long as they are able to fulfill the billion doses of vaccine on the year, their quarterly earnings call last week was also positive &amp; they should continue to deliver good value as a blue chip high yield stock that has shown growth potential.
  
I will absolutely defend my characterization of the efficacy results of the J&amp;J vaccine.  It was expected to be similar to AZ or other adenoviral based vaccines by the researchers and experts, hoping for anything above 50% to get FDA emergency approval, but unlikely to reach the mid 90s of the mRNA based vaccines.  You want to talk about disappointing -- Merck's covid vaccine efforts were terminated due to insufficient immune response.  Merck is a major manufacturer of many vaccines, with a long history of success, and it shows how challenging it is to make effective vaccines.  Their stock took a small hit as well BTW, but also did not plummet LOL.  
  
The public and the media see 60-70% of the JNJ or AZ vaccines and misplace their expectations due to the unusually high efficacy of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.  That doesn't change the fact that 60-70% efficacy is extremely good &amp; having more vaccines available to reduce the severity of the disease will help things get back to normal.  I don't think we disagree on this, apart from your statement that J&amp;J is getting ""KILLED"" in the media, which I still say is hyperbole.  
  
To end on an optimistic note: the J&amp;J vaccine has the potential to improve with the 2-dose regimen trial still ongoing, either through improved duration of the immune response or in actual efficacy % (take into account that we are comparing single dose J&amp;J to two dose AZ, Pfizer &amp; Moderna regimens...).

I’ve tried to remain positive throughout most of this variant news cycle. I’ve tried to tell others not to get beaten down by negative news, especially from non-scientific media. 

I’ve tried to remain positive and remind myself that the main reason for all of this was to avoid hospitals from being overwhelmed, and that all 5 covid vaccines have had a 100% success rate in keeping recipients out of the hospital, even against the South African variant (almost as if immunity is more than just the binding antibodies produced), and that there’s no evidence or data at the moment to suggest that future mutations will do this. 

I’ve tried to remain positive and tell myself that *all respiratory viruses mutate to avoid binding antibodies*, but that doesn’t mean that all protective immunity our bodies create is rendered useless - otherwise wouldn’t the flu kill at rates similar to previous pandemics or similar to times when first introduced as a novel virus to a new population? 

I try to remain positive and tell myself that *even if everything I said above is wrong* - experts like Scott Gottlieb say that it looks like mutations are predictable and slow enough to develop booster shots to stay ahead of the virus. 

But I really want to hear from leaders, decision makers - in the case of everything above being wrong - what is plan effing B. Keep up with public health restrictions for 5 years? Some things forever? Kids can never play with friends again. Students about to enter their highschool years are told, ‘sorry - life is remote now’? Young adults are told - sorry, those weddings you’ve dreamed of are now *too dangerous*? Grandparents can never come over for Christmas anymore, because *you might kill them*, even though they say it’s worth the risk ? **Or** do we choose to move forward as every other human generation has from pandemics and disease - accept higher levels of risk and rates of death. I don’t know about you guys, but given the choice between these two I take the latter 11 times out of 10. 

Sorry. I had to rant, and maybe should get off Reddit and avoid the news for a little while. I really hope plan A works - or at least some % of it. But it really scares me that some people think plan B should be to completely alter how we live our lives and never look back.

We would’ve had masks and PPE secured.  The trump administration ignored American manufacturers who wanted to ramp up production but needed federal dollars to explain capacity.  That impacted healthcare workers and causes shortages.

States would have had clearer guidance and had a consistent nationwide response.  Instead we have 50 states with 50 plans that has resulted in rich people traveling to Florida to skip lines or driving to poorer communities of color after taking up vaccine appointments online.  Poorer communities have a technology gap so older residents in poorer areas are less tech savvy and therefore able to book appointments.  That is happening in NYC.

More people would have taken things seriously and stayed home instead of believing it was a hoax or that there are miracle cures.

We’d also have better data instead of various states bungling death rates nationwide.  

With more vaccines, a better coordinated response, and people taking it seriously we might be able to vaccinate the country and offer help to poorer countries.

Our classes were only able to distance sufficiently back when we were hybrid, but now since they’re trying to be fully in person, there’s no way in our older, cramped classrooms that they can sit six feet apart.

So how is that not hybrid?

If people would be more responsible, we could have those kids in class safely.

Numbers *always* need context.

I think that huge problem is that they're being reported without that context.  For all we know, the J&amp;J vaccine is just as good, but the numbers reported are on a single dose and with a longer wait for it to become effective.

Something not often mentioned is that most of the people getting sick after getting any vaccine are getting sick soon after receiving it, and without looking directly at the data (and, of course, doing a controlled experiment to test this!), it's hard to say how much of the difference between 95% and 60% is coming from that lag period and how much is from other factors and how much is actual difference in efficacy of the vaccines.

I'd argue it's also easy to just hold your breath for a few seconds if you do have to pass someone unexpectedly. I'm incredibly cautious, but I can also admit that wearing a mask 24/7 isn't comfortable. When I'm out on a walk, I keep a kn95  in my back pocket. If I'm going to be in a more populated area, I throw it on. Otherwise, I just keep my distance. All of the data shows that airflow, surrounding volume of air, and sunlight all blunt the ability of the virus to spread. That coupled with the fact that the duration of exposure while walking past someone is negligible. It's pretty safe outdoors if you're not holding a conversation or huddling in an area with people.

‘*Our study does not rule out outdoor transmission of the virus. However, among our 7324 identified cases in China with sufficient descriptions, only one outdoor outbreak involving two cases occurred in a village in Shangqiu, Henan.

But the experiments done on airborne transmission vaporized the virus into an airtight drum and then measured how long it stayed alive... also completely unrealistic.

Are kids who miss out on school activities, friends, effective learning and good grades entitled to get those back if they have to endure years of medical problems or bad family disruptions? If so, who gives it to them?   


A bunch of folks in my town lost their stuff in massive wildfires. If they were adequately insured, they were entitled to other entities paying for them to build new homes and buy new stuff. However, renters and underinsured folks didn’t get the same level of entitlement; they had to adapt and move on. And both groups lost years living in their neighborhood in their own homes. Nobody got those years back, not even the folks who were able to rebuild at Nearly double the sq footage.

When wars happen and disrupt/destroy people‘s lives, families, businesses, jobs, trade, etc... none of them get their lost shit back. Nobody gives it back to them.

COVID19 is a natural disaster comboed with a war and the battlegrounds are our bodies and our societies. None of us are entitled to be given our lost shit back.

How well you do during the lost time and after is up to you. 

This was a surprise rant but I’m really tired of how modern privilege has spoiled so many folks. Like, we aren’t the first humans to endure life-altering problems on a global scale, yo!

There is demographic difference but it does not entirely explain the wide 5 to 6 fold difference in mortality rates for &lt;60 years between developed and developing nations:

It seems to be a combination of higher infection rates, poor hospital care and a higher rates of pre-existing comorbidities in Middle Aged and especially Young Adults in developing countries.

From Chauvin, Fowler &amp; Herrera (2020):

Abstract:

&gt;First, we show that the COVID-19 mortality age gap ***is not explained by younger susceptible populations in developing countries.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Second, ***we provide indirect evidence that higher infection rates play a role***,  showing that variables linked to faster COVID-19 spread such as residential crowding and labor informality are correlated with younger mortality age profiles across cities.  
&gt;  
&gt;Third, we show that lower recovery rates in developing countries account for nearly all of the higher death shares among young adults, and for almost half of the higher death shares among middle-aged adults.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our evidence suggests that lower recovery rates in developing countries are driven by a higher prevalence of preexisting conditions that have been linked to more severe COVID-19 complications, and by more limited access to hospitals and intensive care units in some countries.

I am SOOOOO interested in that notion. Like, why aren't more people discussing that possibility. I am so confused. It could be that it's not a big deal, but still, for there to be NO discussion on that topic is disappointing

&gt;The Oxford tech is inferior to the mRNA tech by far.

I disagree. It depends on what features you value more in a vaccine. The one positive with viral vector vaccines is that they don't require deep freeze storage. Storage at 2-8 °C for mRNA vaccines hasn't been researched, but it's well known that mRNA is a relatively unstable molecule, even when using modified nucleosides.

I am not disputing that the mRNA platform has MANY adventages. They are easier to scale up and produce large quantities. They can be produced more quickly and, a feature you omitted, it's possible to make 3rd dose boosters against new variants, whereas with viral vectors, you can run out of new vectors for avoiding the immune system.

Both are valuable platforms.

Right, Pfizer and Moderna took a little bit of a different strategy, where Pfizer tried to distance itself from the administration and moderna took development money. This caused the government to “favor” the vaccines that were working closer with them, and therefore didn’t get preferential treatment about raw materials.

Yes, this one I feel more strongly about: at the beginning when no data was present, the US government made the right choice to not put all its eggs in one basket. Sure, in hindsight, it would have made the most sense to pour everything we had into Pfizer and moderna since they were the first approved and have great vaccines.

Regardless, you are way too focused on the micro perspective and not on the macro. We are doing extremely well with vaccinations compared to other countries/EU.

Having to commute an hour each way for work every day was destroying my mental and physical health.

Even though you're going nuts, this has decreased the anxiety and stress of many, many people, including myself. I want things back to normal.

Eighteen of the new cases are in the northern province of Hai Duong, now the epicenter of the outbreak.

Quang Ninh, which neighbors Hai Duong and is also a major Covid-19 cluster, has eight, the Central Highlands province of Gia Lai has three and Hanoi has one.

The patients in Gia Lai and Hanoi are related to previous cases confirmed in Hai Duong and Quang Ninh, where the first domestic transmissions of the new outbreak were detected on January 28.

While the source of transmissions of the ongoing outbreak is yet to be identified, it has been determined that it was caused by the U.K. variant, which has been described as more contagious and having a shorter incubation time.

The other case reported Tuesday evening is an imported one, a 43-year-old male Russian expert who landed in Hanoi Monday on AZUR Air flight ZF2074/2078.

Six days since Vietnam recorded the return of Covid-19 community transmissions after 55 clean days, the number of infections have jumped to 304, including 224 in Hai Duong and 38 in Quang Ninh. Infections have spread to eight other cities and provinces - Hanoi with 20 cases, Gia Lai with 13, Bac Ninh three, Hoa Binh two, Binh Duong two, and HCMC, Hai Phong and Bac Giang one each.

You clearly don't understand. The government does not care. We've been begging for assistance and the best we may get is another 2 grand. Of course I want more assistance, but I'm not dumb enough to think they'll actually do anything, I'm being realistic...and you know it too, believing anything else is pie in the sky blind hope. wake up.

So be more concerned with the lives lost rather than the lives destroyed because of the economic fallout? You understand how ridiculous that is right? Remember myast comments about not caring the impact on people? Kinda adding some ammo to that...

And yes, we need tk be concerned with the lives lost...but did we really not have any better way to protect people than feckless, contentious, politically and economically costly Lockdowns? People like Newsom and Whitmer's political futures are in a damn dumpster and (at least in Whitmer's case) she was actually decently effective at keeping her stare healthy. Why was contact tracing not set up in January? Why did states not have a mass testing system within the first month when New York was getting fucked, it's not like it was surprising for us at that point. 

Lockdowns were possibly a temporary necessary evil....but make no mistake they are objectively an evil and we have little evidence so far that they were the lesser evil, only time will tell..

Bottom line, the Lockdowns going forward are just objectively bad policy. They aren't being followed, they're galvanizing support behind radical movements, and they're now explicitly political because politicians are fearing for their jobs if they continue (as they should). If a law is useless what the fuck is the point of said law?

Ex-fucking-actly! Sweden was absolutely right when they recognized that COVID was going to be a long-term problem, other countries like Singapore also recognized that and planned accordingly and haven't needed to lockdown since because that was part of the strategy. This is why the WHO came out and said that countries cannot rely on lockdowns. No one knew when a vaccine was going to arrive or if making one was even possible; it only made sense to mitigate in a way that could be sustainable for at least a year. Places like the US and UK acted like COVID would just go away without really doing anything and now they're paying for it.

Compare this to all the thought and planning that went into the NZ lockdown, and they don't just lockdown at the threat of a single case either.

&gt;It seems as if you dont to be honest, I think you will intepret it as a critique of sputnik, when it's not

Oh please. Drop that. I have only dealt with facts up until now. I think you are starting to realize that those manufacturing aspects are a non-factor. Just don't make assumptions about me, please. Not looking to make this unpleasent.

&gt;It's not the regimen that's approved -- It's trivially checkable. The 62% was not even the overall efficacy from the interim results.

Ok, let's put this to rest. The AstraZenica vaccine is 62% efficacious if used as two doses 3 weeks apart, which has been the main way of administration with the biggest number of participants. It's the recommendation of almost all health agencies amd experts (first that come to mind are EMA and Dr Fauci's comments on UK trial results). UK's decision to space out those two doses has been heavily criticised. 

You say that it's easy to check:

&gt;The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said the AstraZeneca vaccine was about 60% effective in the trials on which it based its decision.

The two dose 3 weeks apart regiment is approved in the EU and I was talking about EU as well as UK. UK is going against the advice of the scientific community.
AstraZeneca's vaccine is given in two doses 3 weeks apart and has efficacy of 62%. Period. Are we now done with the topic of AstraZeneca's vaccine efficacy? Is there now no problem with simply stating that Sputnik V is more efficacious than AZ's vaccine? I don't understand why that was so hard for you. My insisting on facts should not be misinterpreted as ""vaccine cheerleading"". I wasn't even that critical of AZ's vaccine.

## Abstract

**Background**

Although almost a year has passed since the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and promising reports of vaccines have been presented, we still have a long way until these measures are available for all. Furthermore, unsolved issues remained to choose appropriate corticosteroids treatment for COVID-19. We conducted a study to assess the effectiveness of methylprednisolone treatment versus dexamethasone for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

**Method**

In this prospective triple-blinded randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 86 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from August to November 2020, in Shiraz, Iran. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups to receive either methylprednisolone (2mg/kg/day) or dexamethasone (6mg/kg/day). Data was assessed based on a 9-point WHO ordinal scale extending from uninfected (point 0) to death (point 8).

**Results**

There was no significant variation among the groups on the admission. However, the intervention group demonstrated significantly better clinical status compared to the control group at day 5 (4.02 vs. 5.21, *P* = 0.002) and day 10 (2.90 vs. 4.71, *P* = 0.001) of admission. There was also a significant difference in the overall mean score between the intervention group, and the control group, (3.909 vs. 4.873 respectively, *P* = 0.004). The mean length of hospital stay was 7.43 ± 3.64 and 10.52 ± 5.47 days in the intervention and control groups, respectively (*P* = 0.015). The need for a ventilator was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (18.2% vs 38.1% *P* = 0.040).

**Conclusion**

In the context of treating hospitalized hypoxic COVID-19 patients, methylprednisolone demonstrated better results compared to dexamethasone.",,,1612286465,{},glr6mnz,True,t3_lb10ch,False,True,t3_lb10ch,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lb10ch/methylprednisolone_or_dexamethasone_which_one_is/glr6mnz/,1612596182,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,

Same way you should encourage loved ones to get off drug or alcohol abuse or smoking.

A lot of obesity is tied to mental health issues and depression. It's a downward spiral. As someone that has been very fit and trim (used to run 5-6 miles daily, strict protein/veggie diet, weights 2-3 days a week) but eventually teetered on obesity on a couple occasions, I can relate.

A lot of it is a society issue as well. In US, go to grocery store and 80% of what's on the shelves is total garbage for your body. High fat, high calorie, high sodium, high carbs especially high fructose corn syrup. I have to make a strong conscious effort to eat healthy. And also time to prepare proper meals.

That’s a tad silly. 

This is one of the rare instances where closed schools don’t go hand-in-hand with massive lockdowns that will crater the economy for a decade, which is good.

The sad thing is when the middle class leaves these areas to move to places that didn’t lockdown and thus have jobs to offer, they’ll be able to have their children catch back up.

The poor children? They’ll be stuck in these dead areas with absolutely no hope. Their parents won’t be able to move to Texas or Florida or Georgia to take advantage of the booming economies there.

The spread of the highly contagious coronavirus variant first identified in Britain is sparking worry about a future surge in Southern California, one of the nation’s two hot spots of the strain.

Scientists say it is essential to keep coronavirus transmission low and ramp up vaccinations quickly, and if the variant spins out of control, hospital systems could again become overwhelmed. The variant, known as B.1.1.7, has been identified in 467 people in 32 states. Florida has seen the most cases, with at least 147, followed by California, with at least 113.

B.1.1.7 is expected to become the dominant variant within weeks. L.A. County officials announced the second confirmed case Saturday and said it is “spreading in the county.” At least two cases have been identified in San Bernardino County.

San Diego County has California’s largest cluster of known cases of B.1.1.7, at least 109, plus 44 others that are linked epidemiologically to known cases of the variant, officials said last week. Health authorities in San Diego County announced last week the first death linked to B.1.1.7, a 71-year-old man who was a household contact of someone who was confirmed to have been infected by the variant. Two people have been hospitalized with the variant.

The median age of those sickened with B.1.1.7 is 30, but the strain has been identified in newborns and up to age 77, said Dr. Wilma Wooten, the San Diego County health officer.

The emergence of B.1.1.7 “requires us to remain vigilant, to not be complacent, to continue to take all the necessary precautions to slow the spread,” warned Nathan Fletcher, chair of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors.

B.1.1.7 led to a rapid expansion of COVID-19 across the U.K., Ireland and Portugal and quickly became the dominant strain in those countries, Natasha Martin, associate professor in the UC San Diego Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Health, told the Board of Supervisors last week.

“This particular variant is estimated to be 50% to 70% more transmissible than previous variants, leading to surges in cases,” Martin said. “There is recent evidence that it may lead to higher mortality as well.”

California first detected the B.1.1.7 variant Dec. 30 in San Diego County. It’s now estimated to account for 5% of circulating strains, Martin said.

“The question is not whether this strain will become dominant, but how long it will take, and what effect it will have on our epidemic trajectory, given its increased transmissibility,” Martin said.

The dominance of B.1.1.7 could dramatically worsen the pandemic in California. Currently in the state, the effective reproduction number — the average number of people to whom a contagious person transmits the coronavirus — is around 0.8. This means every infected person transmits the virus to fewer than one person, which explains why the pandemic is improving in the state. But should B.1.1.7 become the dominant strain, the reproduction number could become greater than 1, Martin warned.

Officials need to operate with caution in reopening the economy, she said. Even a decent vaccination plan is no match for the U.K. variant if people abandon wearing masks and practicing physical distancing, according to a simulation Martin presented.

If people reject such measures, as many did in the fall, San Diego County will likely see its case count — currently at about 1,500 new cases a day, the lowest in roughly two months — rise to as much as 7,000. That would be far worse than anything the county has experienced so far in the pandemic. The county topped out at about 3,600 new coronavirus cases a day for the seven-day period that ended Jan. 12.

“This scenario ... would overwhelm our health systems,” Martin said. “There is some emerging data that the B.1.1.7 [strain] is more lethal. So we could expect even more deaths than we’re seeing now for every case.”

Reducing the amount of circulating virus would delay the expansion of B.1.1.7, Martin said.

“I can’t stress this enough — with the emergence of B.1.1.7 and other strains which may be more transmissible and potentially more lethal — now is the time to double down on reducing transmission and expanding vaccination,” Martin said.

Concern about the strain, as well as the high number of daily cases, led Wooten last week to retain a San Diego County order that prohibits restaurants from allowing outdoor dining between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.

Dining locations comprised about 20% of confirmed community outbreaks over the last 10 months, according to San Diego County.

Wooten told the supervisors she was uncomfortable allowing restaurants to reopen for outdoor dining service late at night because those that did often transitioned into parties, with households mixing and people drinking and not wearing masks.

“I am uncomfortable — with the number of cases that we still have — with changing that particular order at this time,” Wooten said.

San Francisco has also kept in place an order requiring customers to leave outdoor dining areas by 10 p.m.

That’s a different stance from L.A. County, which Friday allowed outdoor dining to resume, including during late-night hours. L.A. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Monday that the U.K. variant is thus far not dominant in the county. She urged people to continue to wear masks, practice physical distancing and stay at home as much as possible — and, if dining outdoors at restaurants, to adhere to the new rules.

Those rules include dining at a table only with members of your household, with no more than six people and spaced at least eight feet from other tables. Outdoor dining areas must have at least two noncontiguous sides that are completely open to increase the flow of breezes to dissipate exhaled virus particles, and guests are urged to wear masks when their servers approach.

“That’s what we’re trying to do right now: Keep the numbers as low as possible while we wait to get more vaccines and really accelerate the pace of vaccinations,” Ferrer said.

The vaccines that are currently available are believed to be effective against B.1.1.7.

Officials have also voiced concern about a variant identified out of South Africa, B.1.351, and a closely related variant from Brazil, P.1. The South African strain has been detected in two cases in South Carolina — in different parts of the state and not believed to be epidemiologically linked — and one in Maryland. The Brazilian strain has been identified in a single case in Minnesota.

Current vaccines have been found to be less effective against the South African variant, although “it still was not below the cutoff where you would expect some degree of efficacy,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious diseases expert.

Nonetheless, scientists and government officials are working on an additional booster shot in case officials feel it’s needed to protect against new strains.

“This is a wake-up call to all of us,” Fauci told reporters during a briefing Friday. “We will continue to see the evolution of mutants. So that means we ... will have to be nimble to be able to adjust readily to make versions of the vaccine that actually are specifically directed toward whatever mutation is actually prevalent at any given time.”

We must also ramp up vaccination efforts as quickly as we can, Fauci said. “Viruses cannot mutate if they don’t replicate,” he noted.

It’s no coincidence that the rise of mutations is occurring in nations where the coronavirus has run rampant.

“Letting virus run wild, like [the U.S. and] Brazil did, endangers everyone,” Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, tweeted.

The emergence of the U.K. strain could mean that the summer — rather than being a quiet period for the coronavirus — could result in a higher prevalence, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, told CBS News’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday.

“What’s going to likely happen is that the prevalence is going to be high in certain regional hot spots. So we’ll have hot spots of infection and maybe epidemics in parts of Florida, parts of Southern California, because of B.1.1.7. They’ll never really get out of it, but the rest of the country will see prevalence come down,” Gottlieb said.

Gottlieb said that the South African and Brazilian variants — unlike the U.K. strain — don’t seem to be more transmissible than the original virus. That means “we have time to get control of those variants and develop new boosters that could protect against them,” Gottlieb said.

Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, offered a far more dire forecast than Gottlieb’s in an interview Sunday on NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” Osterholm compared the U.K. variant to a forming hurricane and predicted a new surge in six to 14 weeks.

“And if we see that happen — which my 45 years in the trenches tells me we will — we are going to see something like we have not seen yet in this country,” Osterholm said. “That hurricane’s coming.”",,,1612299173,{},gls305v,False,t3_lb4uzt,False,False,t3_lb4uzt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lb4uzt/rapid_spread_of_uk_coronavirus_variant_in/gls305v/,1612613408,13,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],[],text,t2_135jqs,False,False,,

I'd just like to point out that US citizens *aren't* generally in the habit of carrying citizenship documentation, and that documentation (passport book or card) is actually quite slow and somewhat expensive to acquire. $110, I think, last time I checked, and a few months.

The citizen in that news story actually did have a US passport.

He got into an authorized-persons-only part of a hospital (and might have been a patient) where he was accused of setting a fire. Arrested on charges of trespassing and tampering with a fire alarm, but as far as I can tell from news stories, the arson case didn't develop enough evidence. 

Without enough evidence to hold Ramos-Gomez the local police decided to call FBI and ICE. Criminal mischief and maybe-probably setting a small fire in a sprinklered building. 

And despite the authenticity of his passport and his citizenship, ICE took custody and started deportation proceedings.

So I can totally understand people, especially members of profiled minorities, to be skittish around government activities. Even if you're legal, *proving* that can be a huge hassle.

Comparing CFRs between 20 somethings and 40 somethings, 40 somethings are at roughly double the risk of death. It's around 40 where a person's immune system starts weakening significantly from age.

At age 40 CFR is still not at levels of worrying too much about death while sick though. There is significant risk of needing hospitalization and having long recoveries that negatively impact one's career right at their peak earning years though. Being plagued by ongoing fatigue is not what a politician known for his energy wants by any means.

In the end all of these various approaches are looked at and judged as to their reliability (results will vary from study to study) and most importantly in the light that this is a *respiratory* virus. If you touch a surface with virus it won't attack the cells of the finger , and your finger won't fall off. It has to make its way to the respiratory tract (don't such your fingers) to do what it does best. 

So, you are right in that when person X develops the disease and that person has been in places A to W one can't say categorically and dogmatically that X caught it in either the air or a surface at place P. As with all infectious disease what we are looking at is probabilities and statistics. At present what has been studied has led to a consensus that the airborne route is by far the most important.

Fauci said in a December interview on CNN that his range is 75% - 85%. 

A Reuters article also at the end of December quotes him at the end: “Then, when newer surveys said 60 percent or more would take [a vaccine], I thought I can nudge this up a bit, so I went to 80, 85.” 

I have a CNN article from June where he said he would settle for a 70% to 75% effective vaccine, but that low vaccination rates coupled with such a low efficacy vaccine will likely not provide herd immunity. 

I have no doubt Fauci knows these low efficacy vaccines are important to keep old and sick people out of the hospital, but we need more excellent vaccines to *end* the pandemic.

Low efficacy vaccines are a stop gap and these people know it.

Including the eastern religion's, Native American beliefs / spiritual practices, I also studied Islam and Jewish practice (several types). 

I do not advocate any one over another, that is between you and God as you understand God. 

I do however have something to share. I boiled down everything I could understand about what I learned over that 40+ years of reading, talking and thinking about ""What is the right way? , What is good? , What is bad? ...

####
I came up with 2 rules and 1 exception.

Rule #1. I start every day with a vow to myself,
 ""Today I will tell the truth, without fear."" 
That means I have to face truth in my own life about myself. Many if not most days I fall short of my goal/standards on this rule. I just start over the next morning with the hope I will improve. 

Rule #2. I make every effort to treat ever human I interact with by giving them all the love, understanding and compassion I would want for myself if I were in their situation.  Using all the brains, insight and wit that God has granted me. 

Exception #1. 
I have found that some people can not hear the truth about a situation without feeling great pain or anger over what the truth is on a given subject. If you see or feel that the human you are interacting with is or most likely is one of these people, then fall back on rule #2. 

I feel that if we could get just half of all the humans around us to make an effort to live by these 2 rules, we will likely all have the peace we need to better understand God and the plan/ purpose the Great Architect of the Universe has for us. 

At worst I am totally wrong but if so following these rules are unlikely to cause harm and following a principal I learned in my studies ""If it harm none, then let it be done."" 

In the last 14 years that I have been sharing these rules with folks from different religion's I have yet to have anyone give me a reference that these rules violate the principal's or tenants of their religion. If any of you find me wrong please send me the reference so I can study it to find out how and why. 

With my best to all of you.

[],,qkfb,,,,,,[],"Fact check: The COVID-19 pandemic was not orchestrated by pharmaceutical companies, investment groups and philanthropists

A Facebook post suggesting that pharmaceutical companies, global investment groups and billionaire philanthropists conspired to bring about the COVID-19 pandemic has been shared online.

The post claims there are links between the organisations and invites readers to consider that they are proof of a conspiracy. It ends with the sentence: “Now you understand how a dead bat sold in a wet market in China infected the ENTIRE PLANET” (here, here, here, here).

Many of the claims have appeared in similar posts debunked by Reuters (here) and other fact checkers (here and here) in December 2020.

The claims can be roughly split into two themes, the first focussing on the pandemic’s origins in Wuhan and the second highlighting spurious links between global organisations.

The Wuhan laboratory

“The virus started in the biological laboratory in Wuhan”

No evidence. Unverified theories have suggested the virus that causes COVID-19 was synthesised by the Wuhan Institute of Virology (here). However, at the time of publication, the majority of virologists and infectious disease experts say the new virus most likely evolved naturally. A more extensive Reuters report examining origins of COVID-19 can be read here .

“Winterthur built the Chinese laboratory in Wuhan”

False. Winterthur is a Swiss insurance company bought by AXA, a French insurance company, in 2006 (here). It is not a construction company and there is nothing to link it to the building of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was originally founded in 1956 as a Chinese national institution (here).

“The Chinese biological laboratory in Wuhan is funded by Glaxosmithkline”

False. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is not funded by the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). The institute is part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) (here), which is governed by the State Council of the People’s Republic of China (here). In 2019, a CAS member wrote an open letter (here) maintaining that the academy’s funding was split equally between the Chinese government and ‘competitive funding or technology transfer’. The Institute’s partners are listed on its website (here).

“The biological laboratory in Wuhan was funded by Dr. Fauci”

Misleading. Anthony Fauci has been Director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since 1984 (here). The NIAID is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), an agency of the US health department (here).

The NIH confirmed to Reuters by email that it granted $3.4million to the non-profit organisation EcoHealth Alliance Inc over 6 years to fund research into understanding bat coronavirus emergence. The non-profit then awarded that money to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, alongside East China Normal University (Shanghai), the Institute of Pathogen Biology (Beijing), and Duke-NUS Medical School (Singapore).

US government websites show that the Wuhan institute received $814,608 between 2015 and 2019 (here, switch from “Prime Awards” to “Sub-Awards” in the upper right corner). A spokesperson added that the grant to EcoHealth Alliance was terminated on April 24, 2020 and reinstated on July 8, 2020.

A decision by the Trump administration to cut EcoHealth Alliance funding was reported by Politico in April after obtaining emails between EcoHealth Alliance and the NIH (here).

The NIH website shows that the reinstated budget will run until June 2021 (here), but EcoHealth Alliance wrote in August that the NIH had imposed “impossible and irrelevant conditions that will effectively block us from continuing this critical work”.

It is not just the US government that funds the Wuhan institute: the European Union stated on Jan. 26, 2021 that it had awarded grants to the laboratory since 2015. It added that the institute: “delivered the first SARS-Cov2 genome sequence, which enabled partners of the European Virus Archive to design the widely used polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) diagnostic test for COVID-19” (here).

Pharmaceutical companies, investment groups and philanthropists

Pfizer

“Glaxosmithkline own Pfizer!”

False. While GSK has embarked on joint ventures with Pfizer, the two are separate companies (here and here). In fact, Pfizer does not have one owner, but is owned by members of the public and a range of institutions, with the top shareholder being the Vanguard Group (here)

“Bill Gates is a shareholder of Pfizer”

True, at the time of publication. As outlined above, Pfizer has many shareholders. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has owned Pfizer stocks since 2002 (here here) and a 2019 tax return from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust lists Pfizer among its corporate investments (here , see see Foundation Trust annual tax return 2019). The foundation has also provided research grants to the company (here).

BlackRock

“GlaxoSmithKline is managed by Black Rock finances”

Misleading. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, owns 7.5% of GSK (fintel.io/so/us/gsk/blackrock) at the time of publication and is their largest shareholder (here). This does not mean GSK is “managed” by BlackRock, as GSK has 1553 institutional owners and shareholders (fintel.io/so/us/gsk).

“Black Rock is also a major share-holder of MICROSOFT, the property of Bill Gates”

Misleading. BlackRock is the second largest shareholder of Microsoft at the time of publication (here) but Microsoft is not property of Bill Gates. In 2014, media outlets reported that Gates was eclipsed as Microsoft’s largest individual shareholder by the company’s other former CEO, Steve Ballmer (here).

When Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board in 2020, news reports said he owned 1.3% of the company’s shares (here and here).

“Vanguard is a shareholder of Black Rock”

True. Vanguard, another global investment company, is the top shareholder of BlackRock at the time of publication (here).

“Black Rock controls the central banks”

False. The US central bank hired BlackRock in March 2020 to manage commercial mortgage-backed securities in an effort to shore up the economy (here). This means BlackRock assists the Federal Reserve, it does not control it.

George Soros and Winterthur

“Black Rock manage the finances of the Open Foundation Company (SorosFoundation)”

False. Open Society Foundations is the world’s largest private funder of charities and non-governmental organisation (here) owned and funded by billionaire George Soros (here). The foundation has no connection to BlackRock.

Soros Fund Management, however, is an investment fund run by Soros that had shares in BlackRock (here), but sold them in 2020 (here).

“The SorosFoundation serves the French AXA”

False. There is no evidence of a connection between Open Society Foundations and the French insurance company AXA (here). However, financial research website Fintel recorded last year that Soros Fund Management disclosed ownership of more than 450,000 shares of AXA Equitable Holdings (here), a US-based company (here) partially owned by French AXA (here).

“Soros owns the German company Winterthur”

False. Winterthur is a Swiss insurer (here) bought by AXA in 2006 (here).

“Winterthur was built by the German Allianz”

False. Winterthur and Allianz are both insurance companies, but the only connection between them is the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance (ICHEIC), a non-profit association founded in 1998 by US insurance regulators and representatives of Israel to settle outstanding life insurance policies from the Nazi era.

The ICHEIC’s website states that negotiations led to settlements with AXA of France and Winterthur of Switzerland (here) and Allianz’s website says that the German industry accepted responsibility for the involvement of German companies during the Nazi regime (here). This connection may explain why Allianz, AXA and Winterthur are mentioned in this social media post.

“Vanguard is a shareholder of German Allianz”

True. Vanguard is the second largest shareholder of Allianz (here).

VERDICT

False. This post claims to reveal links between the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, pharmaceutical companies involved in COVID-19 vaccine research, global investment groups and billionaire philanthropists George Soros and Bill Gates. It implies these connections, many of which are fabricated or misleading, are evidence that the pandemic was deliberately orchestrated. There is no evidence to support this, nor that the virus was created in a laboratory.

&gt;&gt; Updated 26 January 2021 to include new data. A matched cohort study was undertaken with SGTF and non-SGTF cases, with matching based on 10-year age bands, sex, week of test and lower-tier local authority. There were 92,207 SGTF cases and an equal number of corresponding comparators included in the matched cohort (n = 184,414). A 28 day case fatality risk was calculated for both SGTF and non-SGTF cases. Initial analysis was completed on 8 January 2021; of 14,939 SGTF cases and 15,555 comparators who had at least 28 days between specimen date and the study period end date. There were 25 deaths (0.17%) in SGTF cases and 26 deaths (0.17%) in comparators (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.58 – 1.73). On 19/01/2021, updated linkage of deaths data to the same matched cohort provided increased time for follow- up and ascertainment of deaths identified there were 65 deaths among non-SGTF cases (0.1%) and 104 deaths among SGTF cases (0.2%), within 28 days of specimen date.

This is a problem because almost everyone who dies from flu is elderly and infirm. The same problem exists for Covid trials where the elderly and infirm were not included. Since vaccines rely on your immune system being able to mount a defense, the infirm are much less capable of doing that against germs they are already immune to (for example, they also die from sepsis from pathogens like E. coli and staph, which live within us all our lives) and it isn’t well studied if vaccinating someone with a weakened and aged immune system has much effect.
