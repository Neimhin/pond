Anyway, about the point I was making:

&gt; Stockholm has peaked below hospitalizations compared to the spring, Copenhagen has twice the amount of their spring.

Do you understand what this means? I know you want to compare the two countries to each other more than anything, but this is still true and you chose not to respond to it. Regional differences are more pronounced than ever in the pandemic, so comparing countries has never been more meaningless. But you won't go there, will you?

&gt; Per capita covid deaths in Sweden over the past few weeks remain multiple times higher than its neighbors.

Excess mortality is above reported deaths in Denmark for the last few weeks, while being singlificantly lower in Sweden. [Here is a chart comparing reported deaths per week in blue vs. excess deaths in orange, per week, for the spring outbreak and the second wave.](https://i.imgur.com/ZekVpB8.png)

Dead – pewmanent, inevitabwe. Iwt iws teh Gweat Unknown. W-Wosing a w-woved one can be teh most painfuw expewience. Humans awe teh o-onwy cweatuwes dat awe sewf-awawe of deiw imminent dead.

**55 miwwion peopwe dye evewy yeaw.** 150 d-dousand peopwe dye e-evewy day. Each individwaw dead iws a twagedy. A wot of d-dese peopwe didn’t m-mwake iwt tuwu owd age. Dey might have died fwom stawvation, an a-accident, ow a pweventabwe disease. S-Some of dose deads wewe avoidabwe.

Can ouw m-minds handwe seeing aww teh dead in teh wowwd not b-being juwst statistics awnd feew e-empady awnd sadness? **Do we not cawe about 9 m-miwwion peopwe d-dying each yeaw fwom stawvation?** Miwwions awe dying because of poow wiving conditions. No dwinking watew, no sanitation, waw, wefugees. In teh US 400 dousand peopwe dye fwom wwong m-medicaw tweatment each yeaw.

Iwt iws not dat peopwe don’t cawe about aww dose deads. **Iwt iws b-because most peopwe can’t handwe teh twagedy of wife.** Constantwy dinking of teh suffewing may wead tuwu depwession awnd even teh u-unwiwwingness tuwu wive. So we natuwawwy p-push dose twagedies owt of ouw daiwy wives awnd pwetend dat we awe i-immowtaw. We seek optimism awnd distance ouwsewves fwom suffewing. Humans have not figuwed owt how tuwu handwe teh twagedies of w-wife. Iwt seems dat being ignowant iws teh weason dose s-suffewings stiww exist.

**COVID DEADS GET A DISPWOPOTIONAW AMOUNT OF ATTENTION**  
*Most a-agwee, dat evewy wife iws eqwawwy vawwabwe.*  
A chiwd dying f-fwom cancew iws not wess m-meaningwess dan a g-gwandmodew who iws dying fwom covid? We aww wecognize dat.

Weww now wid covid… dead iws evewywhewe. **We seem tuwu f-focus souwfuwwy on covid deads.** Most of us can’t escape teh idea of dead any wongew. 2020 has aww been about dying. Aww we heaw, evewy day, aww day, iws dead. Teh twagic statistics, new wecowds. Pewsonaw stowies. Yuw might dye fwom a c-cough at teh gwocewy stowe, yuw couwd kiww a gwandmodew juwst wid youw vewy existence. Miwwions awe d-dying fwom dis novew d-deadwy viwus. D-Dead has invaded ouw daiwy wives. Dead has become vewy pewsonaw, vewy pewmanent, someding dat iws wooted d-deepwy in ouw e-expewience. But we have tuwu ask o-ouwsewves, iws dis weawity ow awe we being pewswaded into b-bewieving dat covid iws a novew bwack pwaque?

Most peopwe can’t handwe being constantwy bombawded wid mowbid news. Iwt seems wike a big pawt of humanity iws in a **psychosis-wike state** awnd devewoped a **d-dead phobia**. ***But why?***

**C-COVID DEADS HAVE BECOME PEWSONAW**  
Covid dead iws moved peopwe on a deepwy pewsonaw w-wevew awnd fow dat weason, iwt iws woaded wid a wot of emotion. Peopwe m-mouwn awnd c-cawe about aww teh covid d-deads dey sea on teh news. Aww teh whiwe doing a magic t-twick in teh mind awnd ignowing aww teh o-odew deads dat happen simuwtaneouswy. Dis iws a vewy d-distowted pewception of dead awnd ouw outside wowwd. What awe teh weactions, when covid deads awe given teh wight context? Some p-peopwe feew deepwy i-insuwted. Dey feew wike any statement dat diminishes teh wisk of dying of covid iws undewmine teh sewiousness of dis cwisis. Teh peopwe who question teh wisk of c-covid mowtawity may be accused of being cowd-heawted ***“gwandma-kiwwews”***. “Do yuw not cawe about teh e-ewdewwy, shouwd we juwst wet dem dye”. Which iws a s-stwawman.

Wet us examine teh facts about covid mowtawity. Twy t-tuwu keep an open mind.

Yuw couwd say dat 2 miwwion covid deads in a yeaw awe a wot. Ow, we couwd say, dat dis t-time, humanity got wucky, awnd we dodged a b-buwwet. Dis shouwd be a wawning awnd we shouwd be p-pwepawed fow teh next cwisis.

Teh n-news media awnd teh expewts wawewy but covid d-deads into teh wight context. Do some have a vewy distowted idea of teh wisk of dying fwom covid?

**Teh fact iws - most peopwe expewience covid as teh s-sniffwes ow h-have fwu-wike symptoms. 17% don’t d-devewop any symptoms at aww.** Dis means dat ouw bodies awe awweady quite gud at defeating teh viwus. Ouw human i-immune system iws an excewwent vaccine factowy. We awweady knyow dat fow teh majowity, teh i-immunity has w-wasted ovew 8 m-monds awnd c-counting. As fow teh u-unfowtunate, who expewience covid in a mowe sevewe fowm. Iwt can be a vewy dangewous disease. W-Which means dat we have tuwu pwotect teh ewdewwy awnd vuwnewabwe.

**WONG-COVID**  
**P-Peopwe have ovew mystified wong covid.** We fowget dat infwuenza can be a n-nasty disease. H-Heawing fwom teh fwu might take monds awnd peopwe might expewience pwowonged c-cough, weakness, eaw infection, etc. D-Dewe iws a wot of tawk about p-pewmanent wung damage. Aww dough dis might happen, dis compwication iws stiww v-vewy wawe. Keep in mind dat today we might awweady have 1 – 1,5 b-biwwion covid suwvivows. Teh m-majowity of dem don’t h-have pewmanent wung damage. Teh wungs heaw juwst as wid any odew pneumonia.

**Peopwe keep ovewestimating teh wisk of dying fwom covid.** In teh UK, dey dought dat teh avewage age of covid dead iws 65. In weawity, teh avewage age of dead fwom covid iws teh same as teh a-avewage wifespan, which iws 82 yeaws. H-Hawf of teh covid deads awe 82 awnd above. Dis means dat dese awe vewy owd peopwe. Some of dem wewe awweady dying.

C-Chiwdwen awnd teens shouwd f-feew absowutewy safe, cause deiw immune system handwes covid wid ease. Fow peopwe undew 70, teh wisk of dying fwom covid iws 0,05%.

Teh statistic iws a bit infwated. In s-some countwies, dey count iwt as a c-covid dead, w-when a pewson has tested positive awnd died fow w-whatevew weason. A wot of teh deads awe vewy owd peopwe. Iwt iws vewy h-hawd tuwu detewmine, w-which disease was teh u-undewwying condition, dat caused dead. So most of teh time, w-when dewe iws covid on teh dead cewtificate, iwt iws counted as a covid d-dead.

**ODEW DISEASES**  
Cawdiovascuwaw disease – 17,8 miwwion  
Cancew – 9,6 miwwion  
Stawvation – 9 m-miwwion  
Smoking – 9 miwwion  
Wespiwatowy diseases – 3,9 m-miwwion  
Awcohow – 3 miwwion  
Obesity – 2,8 miwwion  
**COVID – 2 miwwion**

**ONCE IN A CENTUWY PANDEMIC**  
**Iwt iws said dat c-covid iws a once in a centuwy pandemic? Iws iwt weawwy?**  
Spanish fwu kiwwed an estimated 1% tuwu 5,5% of teh entiwe popuwation. In today’s p-popuwation, dis wouwd be 78 – 429 miwwion deads.  
Teh A-Asian fwu (1957 – 1958) kiwwed 0,03 – 0,14% on teh entiwe popuwation. In today’s numbews, dis wouwd be 2,3 -10,6 deads.  
Teh Hong Kong fwu (1968 – 1969) kiwwed 0,03 – 0,11% of teh entiwe popuwation. In today’s numbews, dis wouwd be 2,3-8,4 deads.  
Covid mowtawity wiww be 2 – 4 m-miwwion peopwe. Dat iws 0,02 – 0,05% of teh e-entiwe popuwation. **Which makes iwt teh weast d-deadwy pandemic of dese fouw.**

**WET’S BE W-WESPONSIBWE**  
**In owdew tuwu k-keep teh covid deads in check awnd teh hospitaws wowking, we s-shouwd keep sociaw distancing, washing ouw hands, a-awnd staying s-safe.** But dewe iws wight at teh end of teh tunnew. Fow exampwe, in Amewica, 30% of peopwe might awweady devewop immunity. We awe vaccinating teh ewdewwy a-awnd vuwnewabwe. So soon we sea a wapid faww of deads awnd h-hospitawizations. **We got dis, s-soon iwt iws ovew! A-Awnd don’t bewieve teh scawemongewews who say dat we awe nevew g-going back tuwu nowmaw. We awe awmost dewe. E-Evewyding iws going tuwu be as iwt use tuwu be!**

In India, two vaccines are being used for the vaccination drive - The AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine (manufactured under license by Serum Institute and marketed as Covishield), and Covaxin, manufactured by Indian company Bharat Biotech.

Both these vaccines have had issues with their phase 3 data. However, AstraZeneca still has enough phase 3 trial data to make it reasonable to provide an emergency use authorization.

Bharat Biotech however, did not provide enough phase 3 trial data to the regulators to satisfy them. The regulators actually asked for Bharat Biotech to provide more data, before inexplicably approving the 'vaccine' without additional data being submitted (undoubtedly under pressure from the Central Government).

Critics (including top biotech scientists), are skeptical about Bharat Biotech's Covaxin because of this lack of data. In addition, January 26 is Republic Day in India, and the current government has been known to stoke rampant nationalism, and brand any critics as 'anti-national'. They are also known to support half-baked, no-really working, alternatives, just because they are made in India.

All this combined, a lot of people in India have a healthy dose of skepticism regarding this vaccine. This is why the government has now said, people will *NOT* be given an option on which vaccine they want to take.

In effect this means that a lot of people in India are going to be wary of participating in this vaccination drive. I myself have told my family to not get vaccinated in India, simply because I don't want to risk them getting unproven Covaxin shots. 

Much better to wait it out with masks and sanitization.

&gt;That’s particularly important among Asian populations where confidence in vaccines is already low. A World Economic Forum-Ipsos survey on global attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines found that the percentage of respondents who agreed with taking a vaccine dropped up to 9 percentage points from October to December in countries including South Korea and Japan, which is now posting record numbers of new cases and is slated to start inoculations in late February.

&gt;”Governments charging in too early when they buy vaccines at great cost and find they cannot use them meaningfully or they are expired — that could be a disaster,” said Jeremy Lim, associate professor at the National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.

&gt;Officials have also tried to lower expectations, arguing that rollouts will not immediately allow restrictions to be lifted since it will take the better part of a year for enough people to be vaccinated for conditions to become safe again. Most public health experts suggest around 80% of the population needs jabs before anything resembling herd immunity is achieved.

We’ve had 24 million cases so far, plus 1.5 million vaccinated, 10.5 million half vaccinated.

Some hospitals have already had to go to **extreme lengths** to accommodate the crush of COVID-19 patients — such as setting up beds in hallways or gift shops and temporarily treating people in ambulances when there’s no space for them in overcrowded emergency departments. Patients, however, are still receiving professional care and attention, albeit in an unusual way. “Crisis care is the step beyond that, when there’s just not enough to go around,” said Carol Bayley, former vice president of philosophy and director of justice education for Dignity Health.

While total mortality was 154 above expected. During all of November there were 1200 reported covid deaths, and 700 above baseline.

Sweden has consistently tested almost double the amount per capita in it's 80+ pop compared to Norway, and more even than Denmark with it's large test capacity. Both countries have their testing capacity shifted more towards youths and children. I wrote about this [2 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/k1xmdd/helgtr%C3%A5d_coronavirus_20201127_30/gdr36mb/) when it seemed weird that both Norway, Denmark and Finland had 2-3 weeks each of 10-15% excess mortality while reporting few cases of covid deaths. **note**: i'm **not** saying there are hidden deaths in those countries. testing per capita matters in the elderly. these were weeks 38-42, where the first outbreaks in elderly care and hospitals are first reported from.

The second something started to “work” at scale, to reduce infections, it would get rolled back and it would spike again. It was always walking the razor’s edge, not “as safe as possible.”

It was a total failure of governance to not empower as many as possible to shelter in place (continuous direct payments to households and frozen rents/mortgages); and provide/require those services that are necessary for survival that cannot be done at distance to be done as safely as possible (full PPE, corporate liability for exposure incidents) to prevent infections.

Given the size of the population in China, the possibility of the outbreak getting out of control over there and the potential for further strains to develop in the country should surely be a major concern for the rest of the world. The one thing that this pandemic has shown is the inability of world leaders to work together. If anything, it has also exposed cultural differences not only in behavior but also in willingness to take up the vaccine. Unless there is a cultural shift away from ""wet markets"" and state secrecy, I can see China continuing to be a source of major epidemics as has been seen with the likes of SARS, Bird flu and Covid.

OK, see the problem right there: Sweden and South Korea are not in the same areas as the 10 lockdown countries. Bhattacharya is doing the anti-lockdown equivalent of people who say every country can control COVID with test-and-trace because South Korea did, and ignoring that many of its neighbors have controlled COVID with wildly different policies. Sweden, of course, has done much worse than other Scandinavian countries, so a country without its advantages (like a lot of people who live alone) could have followed its lead and done even worse.

I'm sympathetic to the idea that NPIs don't always help.

While not displayed, it stores the number, no other information, for two weeks.

All other phones are then notified that they had a close contact situation with someone who may have been positive at a specific time and date (so you’ll know how long you should self-isolate for). 

I was very concerned when hearing about the app, but after reading up on it, I was quite surprised with how well it handles privacy of information, especially because Japan isn’t always great with that.

Communicating anything different will just fuel antivaxx movements.

“We warned in 2020 that if we were to rely entirely on vaccines as the only solution, we could lose the very controlled measures that we had at our disposal at the time. And I think to some extent that has come true,” Ryan said, adding the colder seasons and the recent holidays also may have also played a role in the spread of the virus.

“A big portion of the transmission has occurred because we are reducing our physical distancing. ... We are not breaking the chains of transmission. The virus is exploiting our lack of tactical commitment,” he added. “We are not doing as well as we could.”

Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior advisor to the WHO’s director-general, echoed Ryan’s comments, saying, vaccines are not “silver bullets”

“Things can get worse, numbers can go up,” he said. We have vaccines, yes. But we have limited supplies of vaccines that will be rolled out slowly across the world. And vaccines are not perfect. They don’t protect everyone against every situation.”

HHS revealed that the reserves expected for the 2nd dose to allow states to stay on schedule had actually already been released, and used for first jabs:  https://mynbc15.com/news/local/fed-government-seemingly-out-of-covid-19-vaccine-reserves-for-states-including-alabama.

NOW, PFizer says that THEY were the ones that held back the second doses.

The man was in stable condition and was to remain isolated until he was cleared by public health officials, according to County Judge Clay Jenkins.

Those all too altruistic souls  would never, never, never publish ""propaganda"" and their motives have been, are now and will be always nothing but completely holy and pure. ""Forever and ever, world without end, Amen"". What faith ! These are indeed the чистый и святой, and anyone who questions any of their claims is obviously on the side of Satan (or whatever the demon favored by the ruling clique of the day may be). 

This sort of rhetoric is the Swiss Army knife of politics. Switch the nouns and it can be used by anybody and everybody for anything and everything. In fact that is exactly how it is used, especially by ruling classes and their supporters. 

By the way, to intrude a little fact into the hymns of praise  China began vaccinating before Russia did. Actually the USA did as well on a much smaller scale. Both began on [March 16](https://qz.com/1940097/what-we-know-about-chinas-covid-19-vaccines/). Russia began 'mass trials' [at the end of August after 2 months of ""small scale trials""](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-russia-vaccine/russia-to-begin-covid-19-vaccine-trials-on-40000-people-next-week-idUKKBN25G1IG?edition-redirect=uk) (ie end of June). Let's see now. That's 3 1/2 months later. As Chekhov on Star Trek might say, ""Russia iwented time travel"". 

The word 'volunteer' keeps appearing in all such reports. In the case of China the word 'volunteer' is greatly suspect as it is in Russia. The vaccine in both Russia and China was initially tried out on soldiers. 'Volunteer' may very well describe civilians in Wuhan, but it hardly applies to soldiers anywhere, and the results of military trials will never see the honest light of day unless they have first been cooked to a golden brown. As for the USA, a supposedly 'civilized' country with a free market in blood and its derivatives I would not be surprised to find financial inducement behind at least some of the 'volunteerism'. 

I have always been impressed by the parallels between Russian and American history, parallels that are not the usual subject of conversation, especially amongst the apologists of either Empire. This, however, is a difference. In Russia the first response of its rulers has generally been to command. In the USA it is more often to bribe.

No. The Media portrays it as such. Actual scientists will tell you that there isn’t conclusive evidence for either hypothesis.

Only frauds like [Peter Daszak, who orchestrated an actual conspiracy to push the natural origin narrative](https://usrtk.org/biohazards-blog/ecohealth-alliance-orchestrated-key-scientists-statement-on-natural-origin-of-sars-cov-2/) claim there was conclusive evidence when there isn’t.

On the news this morning someone mentioned that the young are who are spreading the virus more than the seniors in long term care facilities and how they're seeing deaths of those have received the first dose and there's complexity of whether they died as a side effect of the vaccine or because you know, they're 90 years old and not in great health to start. There seemed to be a bit of a debate whether the sequence of vaccinations should be re-thought to give it to the young that are spreading it first.

My Wife hasn't had any changes in her career, salaried and no change in work except masks and safety precautions. 

We typically don't go out to dinner or movies much, so that really hasn't changed. Pretty much all businesses we frequent have been deemed ""essential"" here so even the stores I need/want to go to never closed. 

Honestly my life hasn't really changed since this started. We vacation in the woods in TN, so even our vacations weren't changed. We go to the woods and don't see other people. We were actually ""safer"" on vacation. 

It's hard for me to relate to the millions of people around the world who have been deeply effected by this virus and I genuinely feel terrible for them. I know this has taken a toll on many people, even those who haven't been directly effected by the virus.

The change came from weighting the ethics of the rollout, with such considerations as minorities being underepresented in the oldest population. States were not required to follow the guidance.

Now, if i were a democrat politician/policymaker, the best way to balance effectiveness of the rollout and avoid backlash from the woke wing of my party would be to try the more complex CoA, wait for people to demand things move faster, then switch, claiming we tried with the best intentions.

The reason why will shock you. 

&gt;That analysis showed that the ""hook"" part of the spike had evolved to target a receptor on the outside of human cells called ACE2, which is involved in blood pressure regulation. **It is so effective at attaching to human cells that the researchers said the spike proteins were the result of natural selection and not genetic engineering.**

But if you look into what one of the Wuhan labs was tasked with doing, you would see that they were working on coronavirus gain of function experiments where they combined two bat-borne coronaviruses. 

&gt;[More controversial](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/chinese-lab-conducted-extensive-research-on-deadly-bat-viruses-but-there-is-no-evidence-of-accidental-release/2020/04/30/3e5d12a0-8b0d-11ea-9dfd-990f9dcc71fc_story.html) was the Wuhan institute’s 2015 research into creating a chimera, the hybrid virus that combined elements from two bat-borne coronaviruses, including one that causes SARS. The mutated virus that resulted was more easily able to infect human cells, making it more useful for lab experiments. Such “gain of function” experiments — which enhance a pathogen’s natural traits — have been a source of controversy in the West because of the potential for harm if an altered strain escapes the confinement of the lab, experts say.

So there is a lab in Wuhan, directly manipulating coronaviruses from wild animals, with the intent of making them stronger. The research article claims that because the spike receptor is soo good, it couldn't possibly be from genetic engineering. Couldn't it be possible that the lab was very successful with the gain of function experiments to the point that the virus escaped the lab?",,,1610779051,{},gjfikjg,False,t3_kyciel,False,True,t1_gjfg1gl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kyciel/us_steps_up_claims_covid19_may_have_escaped_from/gjfikjg/,1610871610,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_gptoh,False,True,,

The study was extremely limited and ran under ideal conditions (air filtration and conditioning systems on the plane working at 100%, at ground level/pressure, and testing conditions were as if only 1 person on an entire flight was positive and they didn’t move from their seat at all). The study found that there *might* not be enough COVID virus particles in the air on a plane to spread COVID and that most of those particles were kept close to the floor. 

But I read that study, and there’s no way all planes are running at ideal conditions with perfectly working filters. Plus people move around on flights, especially longer flights. And if there’s more than one positive person, then the chances go way up. Yet with their findings, they determined that flying was one of the safest things to do during the pandemic. It was nothing but DoD/Gov BS to instill false confidence to prop up the airline industry.

On top of plenty of data, studies and tests to verify it. The Brazil, South African and American(maybe Lebanon too) ones are notable due to being more contagious. In addition to them being associated with spikes/waves in their respective region of origin. These variants seem to be slightly more contagious or better adapted to the people/climate living within that region.

My main concern though is just the genetic drift of these variants evolving in increasingly divergent directions.

1. Most masks do not protect you from others, they protect others from you. Therefore the only way you wearing a mask would change anything is if you yourself were sick. But if you were sick you shouldn't be in public in the first place 

2. The masks that do protect you from others were in short supply and more urgently needed by healthcare staff 

3. For people that are not used to masks, wearing one could lead to you touching your face more which would increase your chance of getting infected

All of these reasons and more guided the advice at the time, and were explained to the public to support the reasoning. However advice was later supplanted when we found out (1) was not actually true, since we learned that you could (and many were) carry and spread the virus without showing any symptoms and therefore not know if you were sick and should stay home. So the advice became for everyone to wear a mask in case they were unknowingly spreading the virus

The initial advice was a mistake by health officials who made the best call they could have with the current knowledge at the time, but knowledge is always evolving and we later learned important information that would have changed their decision.

That's not their fault, it's just how science works.

In theory at least, it should be as hard to get from 500,000 cases per day to 500 cases per day as it is to get from 500 to 5... the tail end is disproportionately time consuming (but necessary, to avoid a resurgence).

But of course Europe does not need to be considered as one entity - when a region such as Ireland for example achieves elimination of the disease, restrictions can be lifted in that region (and incoming travelers subject to quarantine, just like in Australia right now). 

So if Melbourne-style restrictions were imposed, you could expect most places to be free of them (and of the disease) on a similar time scale as Melbourne, but a few unlucky ones would have to continue with the restrictions for the best part of the year, as you mentioned.

&gt;A commonly stated idea is that there is often an evolutionary trade-off between virulence and transmissibility because intra-host virus replication is necessary to facilitate inter-host transmission but may also lead to disease, and it is impossible for natural selection to optimize all traits simultaneously. In the case of MYXV, this trade-off is thought to lead to ‘intermediate’ virulence grades being selectively advantageous: higher virulence may mean that the rabbit host dies before inter-host transmission, whereas lower virulence is selected against because it does not increase virus transmission rates. A similar trade-off model has been proposed to explain the evolution of HIV virulence40. However, many doubts have been raised about the general applicability of the trade-off model35,41,42,43, virus fitness will be affected by traits other than virulence and transmissibility39,41,44, contrary results have been observed in experimental studies45 and relatively little is known about evolutionary trade-offs in nature. For example, in the case of the second virus released as a biocontrol against European rabbits in Australia — rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) — there is evidence that virulence has increased through time, probably because virus transmission often occurs through blow flies that feed on animal carcasses, making host death selectively favourable46. Similarly, experimental studies of plant RNA viruses have shown that high virulence does not necessarily impede host adaptation47 and, in the case of malaria, higher virulence was shown to provide the Plasmodium parasites with a competitive advantage within hosts48.

""A string of European countries have said that the amount of COVID-19 vaccines they are receiving from Pfizer (PFE) has fallen short of their expected supplies.

The US pharmaceutical giant, which has partnered with Germany’s BioNTech (BNTX), has slowed shipments and distribution proceeds unevenly among states in the European Union (EU).

Pfizer and BioNTech have two contracts with the EU for the supply of up to 600 million doses in 2021. The UK ordered 40 million doses in total, enough to inoculate 20 million people, under a third of the total population of 67 million.

However, sources told Reuters that one-third of the 27 EU governments said they had “insufficient” doses of vaccines at a video conference of health ministers on Wednesday.

I’ll agree with a part of your premise somewhat but it’s not given proper context. Sure, COVID is not going to take away as big a % of the population as other diseases/causes. However, it’s been cutting through our population despite billions and billions in spending, massive lockdowns, and constant awareness. It only needs tiny lapses in concentration to spread quickly throughout a community. 

I absolutely reject just saying it’s some sniffles or just a cold or mild flu. On average that statement may have merit but the variety of reactions people have is so wide. And a huge chunk of people say it was one of the worst experiences of their life. I refuse to look at something like that and call it ‘just the sniffles.’

Yes, the world will eventually return to normal. But comments like yours are unwarranted and the opposite of helpful. I’m not saying live life in fear.

Instead we were given hope of a normal summer or possibly spring that has been dashed. Millions have to continue to weather economic hardship, fear of getting sick, and possibly even death for many months longer than anticipated. I'm disgusted and pissed.

[],,HarriJokker,,,,,,[],"**DEATH**  
Death – permanent, inevitable. It is the Great Unknown. Losing a loved one can be the most painful experience. Humans are the only creatures that are self-aware of their imminent death.

**55 million people die every year.** 150 thousand people die every day. Each individual death is a tragedy. A lot of these people didn’t make it to old age. They might have died from starvation, an accident, or a preventable disease. Some of those deaths were avoidable.

Can our minds handle seeing all the death in the world not being just statistics and feel empathy and sadness? **Do we not care about 9 million people dying each year from starvation?** Millions are dying because of poor living conditions. No drinking water, no sanitation, war, refugees. In the US 400 thousand people die from wrong medical treatment each year.

It is not that people don’t care about all those deaths. **It is because most people can’t handle the tragedy of life.** Constantly thinking of the suffering may lead to depression and even the unwillingness to live. So we naturally push those tragedies out of our daily lives and pretend that we are immortal. We seek optimism and distance ourselves from suffering. Humans have not figured out how to handle the tragedies of life. It seems that being ignorant is the reason those sufferings still exist.

**COVID DEATHS GET A DISPROPOTIONAL AMOUNT OF ATTENTION**  
*Most agree, that every life is equally valuable.*  
A child dying from cancer is not less meaningless than a grandmother who is dying from covid? We all recognize that.

Well now with covid… death is everywhere. **We seem to focus soulfully on covid deaths.** Most of us can’t escape the idea of death any longer. 2020 has all been about dying. All we hear, every day, all day, is death. The tragic statistics, new records. Personal stories. You might die from a cough at the grocery store, you could kill a grandmother just with your very existence. Millions are dying from this novel deadly virus. Death has invaded our daily lives. Death has become very personal, very permanent, something that is rooted deeply in our experience. But we have to ask ourselves, is this reality or are we being persuaded into believing that covid is a novel black plaque?

Most people can’t handle being constantly bombarded with morbid news. It seems like a big part of humanity is in a **psychosis-like state** and developed a **death phobia**. ***But why?***

**COVID DEATHS HAVE BECOME PERSONAL**  
Covid death is moved people on a deeply personal level and for that reason, it is loaded with a lot of emotion. People mourn and care about all the covid deaths they see on the news. All the while doing a magic trick in the mind and ignoring all the other deaths that happen simultaneously. This is a very distorted perception of death and our outside world. What are the reactions, when covid deaths are given the right context? Some people feel deeply insulted. They feel like any statement that diminishes the risk of dying of covid is undermine the seriousness of this crisis. The people who question the risk of covid mortality may be accused of being cold-hearted ***“grandma-killers”***. “Do you not care about the elderly, should we just let them die”. Which is a strawman.

Let us examine the facts about covid mortality. Try to keep an open mind.

You could say that 2 million covid deaths in a year are a lot. Or, we could say, that this time, humanity got lucky, and we dodged a bullet. This should be a warning and we should be prepared for the next crisis.

The news media and the experts rarely but covid deaths into the right context. Do some have a very distorted idea of the risk of dying from covid?

**The fact is - most people experience covid as the sniffles or have flu-like symptoms. 17% don’t develop any symptoms at all.** This means that our bodies are already quite good at defeating the virus. Our human immune system is an excellent vaccine factory. We already know that for the majority, the immunity has lasted over 8 months and counting. As for the unfortunate, who experience covid in a more severe form. It can be a very dangerous disease. Which means that we have to protect the elderly and vulnerable.

**LONG-COVID**  
**People have over mystified long covid.** We forget that influenza can be a nasty disease. Healing from the flu might take months and people might experience prolonged cough, weakness, ear infection, etc. There is a lot of talk about permanent lung damage. All though this might happen, this complication is still very rare. Keep in mind that today we might already have 1 – 1,5 billion covid survivors. The majority of them don’t have permanent lung damage. The lungs heal just as with any other pneumonia.

**People keep overestimating the risk of dying from covid.** In the UK, they thought that the average age of covid death is 65. In reality, the average age of death from covid is the same as the average lifespan, which is 82 years. Half of the covid deaths are 82 and above. This means that these are very old people. Some of them were already dying.

Children and teens should feel absolutely safe, cause their immune system handles covid with ease. For people under 70, the risk of dying from covid is 0,05%.

The statistic is a bit inflated. In some countries, they count it as a covid death, when a person has tested positive and died for whatever reason. A lot of the deaths are very old people. It is very hard to determine, which disease was the underlying condition, that caused death. So most of the time, when there is covid on the death certificate, it is counted as a covid death.

**OTHER DISEASES**  
Cardiovascular disease – 17,8 million  
Cancer – 9,6 million  
Starvation – 9 million  
Smoking – 9 million  
Respiratory diseases – 3,9 million  
Alcohol – 3 million  
Obesity – 2,8 million  
**COVID – 2 million**

**ONCE IN A CENTURY PANDEMIC**  
**It is said that covid is a once in a century pandemic? Is it really?**  
Spanish flu killed an estimated 1% to 5,5% of the entire population. In today’s population, this would be 78 – 429 million deaths.  
The Asian flu (1957 – 1958) killed 0,03 – 0,14% on the entire population. In today’s numbers, this would be 2,3 -10,6 deaths.  
The Hong Kong flu (1968 – 1969) killed 0,03 – 0,11% of the entire population. In today’s numbers, this would be 2,3-8,4 deaths.  
Covid mortality will be 2 – 4 million people. That is 0,02 – 0,05% of the entire population. **Which makes it the least deadly pandemic of these four.**

**LET’S BE RESPONSIBLE**  
**In order to keep the covid deaths in check and the hospitals working, we should keep social distancing, washing our hands, and staying safe.** But there is light at the end of the tunnel. For example, in America, 30% of people might already develop immunity. We are vaccinating the elderly and vulnerable. So soon we see a rapid fall of deaths and hospitalizations. **We got this, soon it is over! And don’t believe the scaremongerers who say that we are never going back to normal. We are almost there.

If there were only 3000 infections that were traced back to the flights, then flying is relatively safe (the average flight apparently carries about 70 passengers). So 1% of flights, and let's say 2% chance of contracting covid on the flight if there was a positive case means that your chance is around 0.02% on a flight.

Some choice quotes:

&gt; Why has the U.S. done so much worse than the rest of 
the world?

&gt; I think this virus has a unique ability to have differential pathogenesis in different people. And what it really does is it exploits the underlying health condition of the individual it infects. 

Really? That was your first answer of why we've done so poorly? Not the massive failures in public policy leading up to the pandemic, not because of the massive amount of non-compliance with restrictions in this country? 

&gt; Well, I'm actually very proud of the response that CDC has done... CDC, obviously, you know, on April 3 stressed the American public the importance of wearing a face covering, a mask.

Yes, *ON APRIL 3RD*. After more than a month of telling everyone in America that ""masks don't work"".

Oh,[ it also took you basically the entire pandemic to admit that airborne transmission was the primary transmission vector](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/scientific-brief-sars-cov-2.html), despite anyone who knows anything knowing that the entire time. 
&gt; Dr. Rochelle Walensky, your incoming successor, in this piece that she published in The New York Times this week, wrote this: ""Our team of scientists will have to work very hard to restore public trust in the C.D.C., at home and abroad, because it has been undermined over the last year."" 

&gt; That's just not true. The men and women at CDC are highly respected across this nation and around the world. Clearly, there's no doubt that the lack of reinforcement and support from some individuals in the administration of the public health message had impact.

""the lack of reinforcement and support from some individuals in the administration of the public health message had impact""?!?!

Once the vaccine planning board in our state got wind of this they decided to just cut them off and open the next phase. 

Our healthcare workers who are eligible must schedule their shot by tomorrow or they go all the way to the back of the line with the general pop. I was really surprised they’re cutting them off completely to do the next phase. It doesn’t seem hard to let someone who decides to get it later go ahead and get it, but I guess logistically they don’t want to count those shots as earmarked for their staff anymore?

Background: Reinfection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been documented, raising public health concerns. Risk and incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection were assessed in a large cohort of antibody-positive persons in Qatar. Methods: All SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive persons with a PCR-positive swab ≥14 days after the first-positive antibody test were individually investigated for evidence of reinfection. Viral genome sequencing was conducted for paired viral specimens to confirm reinfection. Results: Among 43,044 anti-SARS-CoV-2 positive persons who were followed for a median of 16.3 weeks (range: 0-34.6), 314 individuals (0.7%) had at least one PCR positive swab ≥14 days after the first-positive antibody test. Of these individuals, 129 (41.1%) had supporting epidemiological evidence for reinfection. Reinfection was next investigated using viral genome sequencing. Applying the viral-genome-sequencing confirmation rate, the risk of reinfection was estimated at 0.10% (95% CI: 0.08-0.11%). The incidence rate of reinfection was estimated at 0.66 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 0.56-0.78). Incidence rate of reinfection versus month of follow-up did not show any evidence of waning of immunity for over seven months of follow-up. Efficacy of natural infection against reinfection was estimated at &gt;90%. Reinfections were less severe than primary infections. Only one reinfection was severe, two were moderate, and none were critical or fatal. Most reinfections (66.7%) were diagnosed incidentally through random or routine testing, or through contact tracing. Conclusions: Reinfection is rare. Natural infection appears to elicit strong protection against reinfection with an efficacy &gt;90% for at least seven months.  ",,,1610812078,{},gjgx7zd,True,t3_kyl6x1,False,False,t3_kyl6x1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kyl6x1/sarscov2_reinfection_in_a_cohort_of_43000/gjgx7zd/,1610897984,28,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_6mcba1ot,False,False,,

From my understanding of the literature, a good chunk of the research into this technology has been for traditionally challenging viruses or diseases, including HIV and cancer. I wouldn’t expect a fast approval process for something that looks to inoculate against those diseases, assuming it even works (HIV, as I understand it, is notorious for mutating very quickly). 

We got really lucky, I think. This coronavirus has a very distinctive spike protein that can be effectively targeted by a vaccine to teach the immune system about the threat. While it mutates, it doesn’t seem to be as volatile as other viruses. We already had a strong understanding of how mRNA tech could be applied. We are capable of sequencing genomes incredibly quickly. All of this put together means we basically had our mRNA vaccine candidates ready to go *last January,* and we basically spent the rest of 2020 doing the vaccine trials. 

If this had happened in the 90s, who knows how well we would have fared as a society. We got really lucky we had all the right tech at the right time. 

As for mRNA vaccines generally, my reading of the available literature shows more concern about efficacy (maintaining efficacy from animal trials to human trials, long-term efficacy, etc.) than side effects. Generally, early trials revealed comparable side effects to more “traditional” vaccines. We saw the same side effects in the Moderna and Pfizer trials.

However, I’d suggest that you also keep hospital capacity in mind. Rural areas have less population density by definition, but they also have very small, often poorly-equipped hospitals, so lots of our cases end up being sent to nearby cities (and further overwhelming them). My current county has almost 90,000 people, but only 20 ICU beds (and we get patients from smaller counties surrounding us). 

To give you a concrete example, I work in almost a dozen high schools supporting students and staff, and my husband is working from home. He is high risk because of a rare immune condition, and if he needs to be hospitalized, we pass our local hospital and keep driving for hours to get to a city in a neighboring state with his specialists, more highly skilled nurses, and better equipment. (When we’ve gone to our local hospital, they’ve transferred him to the city, so this isn’t just us being picky.) So even though I live in a rural area, vaccinating me helps to prevent him from taking up city resources.

(Of course, I’d prefer big-picture changes to the whole system so that we didn’t have to make these trade-offs, but in one of the reddest states and under this administration, I’ll argue for tweaks to the margins.)",,,1610816030,{},gjh6l0b,False,t3_kybc49,False,True,t1_gjfl355,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kybc49/pfizer_says_it_has_second_doses_of_covid19_shot/gjh6l0b/,1610903758,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_favoe,False,False,,

 Asadi, S., Cappa, C.D., Barreda, S. et al. Efficacy of masks and face coverings in controlling outward aerosol particle emission from expiratory activities. Sci Rep 10, 15665 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-72798-7


 Although mask wearing is intended, in part, to protect others from exhaled, virus-containing particles, few studies have examined particle emission by mask-wearers into the surrounding air. Here, we measured outward emissions of micron-scale aerosol particles by healthy humans performing various expiratory activities while wearing different types of medical-grade or homemade masks. Both surgical masks and unvented KN95 respirators, even without fit-testing, reduce the outward particle emission rates by 90% and 74% on average during speaking and coughing, respectively, compared to wearing no mask, corroborating their effectiveness at reducing outward emission. These masks similarly decreased the outward particle emission of a coughing superemitter, who for unclear reasons emitted up to two orders of magnitude more expiratory particles via coughing than average. In contrast, shedding of non-expiratory micron-scale particulates from friable cellulosic fibers in homemade cotton-fabric masks confounded explicit determination of their efficacy at reducing expiratory particle emission. Audio analysis of the speech and coughing intensity confirmed that people speak more loudly, but do not cough more loudly, when wearing a mask. Further work is needed to establish the efficacy of cloth masks at blocking expiratory particles for speech and coughing at varied intensity and to assess whether virus-contaminated fabrics can generate aerosolized fomites, but the results strongly corroborate the efficacy of medical-grade masks and highlight the importance of regular washing of homemade masks.

Quick Takes

The protective effects of masks against respiratory viral infections were not only significant for both healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-HCWs, but also consistent between populations.

Based on available evidence, it makes sense to wear a mask for both HCWs and non-HCWs to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.",,,1610822446,{},gjhmwow,False,t3_kyltbk,False,False,t1_gjhloi6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kyltbk/us_life_expectancy_drops_dramatically_due_to/gjhmwow/,1610914085,18,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_5ji6yg1t,False,True,,

Suppose the average vaccinations increase to 2 million a day average over the 3 months, say half are already infected 1 x 90 + 140 = 230 = 69% with 60% protection could be enough to put a serious dent in transmission. The biggest issue with the US will simply be uptake of the vaccine. But fortunately the people that do take it will take two which means you're looking at about 1/3rd with 90% protection, 1/3rd with natural protection. April may be optimistic, but I think that sometime in Q2 the US will see a fairly large decrease in daily cases due to vaccinatons/infections and other factors.",,,1610829446,{},gji2ao9,False,t3_ky8tik,False,True,t1_gjgtq13,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ky8tik/cdc_new_covid19_strain_could_become_predominant/gji2ao9/,1610924263,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_7gb52,False,False,,

I am 24 now and I am on suboxone, and now vyvanse as well as a number of other medications. I have an eating disorder.

My time in rehab was really hard and when I finished I felt that I didn't fully get what I needed to get from it and that I was gonna relapse. But I continued to go to AA and NA, trying to keep my recovery in check. Surely enough, I relapsed a few times, the first in May, the most recent time in December. Not on opiates or meth, my drugs of choice thankfully. A bit of alcohol, weed, clonazepam (this one is the worst... this could sink me if I do it again) and I blame it on the pandemic as much as I blame myself. I was no longer able to attend AA and NA or see my one friend that stuck with me. I still can't really go to NA even though they started up again, I take shifts with my mom and my aunts taking care of my 91 year old grandmother who has dementia and just broke her hip, so she needs almost 24 hour care. I don't want to get her sick, her quality of life is already terrible due to all the health problems. My other friend fell deep into Qanon where he is today, so he has been the opposite of supportive. 

I haven't been exercising, I haven't been eating breakfast or lunch. Eating junkfood. Luckily I have not used weed alcohol or pills since before christmas. But this year has been HARD. It has been a lot of two steps forward, I start forcing myself to eat breakfast, make my bed, shower every single day, go for a walk for a week or two, and then I fall back to where I was for a month. Heavy anxiety, a very physical anxiety too, is it because of the medication cocktail I am on currently? Hard to say because I can rarely see my doctor and certainly not see a psychiatrist.

 Since new years I have bought fish oils and vitamin d and other vitamins and melatonin and herbal tea and I feel a bit better, as it stands now I am eating breakfast, usually eating lunch, lifting weights a couple times a week (something I haven't done for years), stretches, going for a walk. I really am trying, I really am forcing myself to not go and buy a couple beers, I threw out my weed, I quit smoking (again) for 3 months now. I know I can't even have one drink, I know how bad it can get. I am scared. But I take this crisis very seriously, so for me, it is staying at home 24/7 except to go to my weekly suboxone doctor appointment. I don't know where I am going with this, but it feels like my body has aged ten years this past year.",,,1610831034,{},gji6a8g,False,t3_kya16w,False,False,t3_kya16w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kya16w/yes_the_pandemic_is_ruining_your_body/gji6a8g/,1610926666,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_6ptyiw3k,False,False,,

**STOP THAT RIGHT NOW!!!**

The endgame is to get *everyone* vaccinated. Period. You're a drop in the bucket compared to the millions of vaccines going around right now. If you're offered one, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, JUST TAKE IT!

Because first of all, there's a good chance your vaccine was already rejected by multiple other people. There is an ALARMING trend going on right now with tons of folks out there who qualify but are saying no. My company has 1,000 employees and did a survey last week that found almost 50% of folks are planning to reject the vaccine. 500 people! 

What exactly are governments and companies supposed to do with those extra vaccines? A lot of orders are happening under the assumption that most people will accept it. Obviously, that's not happening, too many people are being anti-vax or just plain skeptical or hesitant. 

Those extras NEED to be used somehow, or they're going to waste. You wanna discuss the morals of getting yours too early, but what about the morals of turning it down and it going to waste?

Not to mention if you're trying to keep yourself and others safe, then shouldn't you JUMP at the chance? Safety's the whole basic idea here, and turning down maybe the biggest safety thing we've had yet, that honestly doesn't sound very moral to me. 

And that's not even getting into all these people out there flouting masks and distance and safety measures. I'm already seeing way too many chin-diaper people judging certain folks for getting the vaccine early, and I'm just sitting here like dude, you don't even know how to wear a mask, back off (facepalm)

If you're offered it, just take it. Don't question it. You got a chance SO many others would kill for. Don't feel bad and don't let anyone shame you. Again, getting everyone vaccinated is the whole point, so no one can or should blame you just cuz you got it a couple months early.

But they are assuming 60 per 100k is roughly 200k cases a day on Jan 1st. That’s with **25%** reporting. So really we could be at 800k. Then that number goes up to 80 per 100k so I think its 333k by 25% reporting. So 1,332,000 million is 100% reporting. Then they are assuming we have 10-30% immune from reinfection/spreading which is 98,460,000 people (however, I’m 50% sure this strain can reinfect people). 

So essentially they cut out 98,460,000 people from the data. Leaving us with 229,740,000. 1,332,000 times .3 goes to 1,731,600 million. Then they are assuming the rate the virus is already in circulation to be 0.5%. 

I’m willing to bet that 0.5 is actually 25% reporting so now we have 2% circulation. Multiply 1,731,600 by 4 we get 6,926,400 million. But that doesn’t equate to expotential growth. Exponential could be anything. However, it’s not good that they cut off the data after May, meaning they aren’t sure what’s to happen or assuming the virus starts dying down again.

&gt;covering up the origin

This is pretty difficult to determine since Italy has recently discovered covid cases from September 2019, many months before China's first known cases. Do we really have the data to determine that it started in China prior to September 2019? If not, do we sanction Italy for misdiagnosing 2019 Covid deaths and not discovering it until recently?


&gt;Silencing doctors

China have been silencing people for decades. The world hasn't cared before, so as much as I agree with you in theory here, nobody will ever sanction China for this. Just like we wont sanction Russia for all those covid doctors that have ""accidentally"" fallen to their deaths. 

&gt;Allowing infected to travel out

The US, the UK, Brazil, and many other nations are guilty of this. Do we sanction everywhere that has done a shit job of managing this virus? 

&gt;buying up other countries PPE

How is this worthy of sanctions? Most PPE comes from China in the first place, it naturally makes sense for them to keep it all in their own country before shipping it out elsewhere. If anything, this is the fault of other countries for not having adequate pandemic supplies/choosing not to make it in their own countries. The UK for example voted against stockpiling pandemic-level PPE a few years ago, so a PPE shortage in the UK is the fault of the UK government, not for china for hoarding their own shit.

They've shipped 30M in total so far, so by end of March it looks like 200M total doses shipped from these 2 vendors is unlikely. Again, both disappointing and angering given this still hasn't been communicated, only deduced from math. 

J&amp;J delays are a real downer in that case also with very low volume till at least April.

Looks like 65-70M people could be vaccinated from shipped doses by end of March, holding aside ability to get shots in arms. Won't be until April, may, June that allocated doses could really increase (if we are lucky). By then hopefully +40M could be vaccinated a month from shipped doses. It would mean that we would have enough doses by labor day. 

Constantly sliding numbers. There was a time when we were told the vaccines would be approved in October, and 300M doses available upon approval.

It was already out of control, and that’s what we are seeing in January too.”

On Thursday, officials imposed a 7 a.m. curfew and suspended public transportation on roads and rivers to contain the spread of the disease. While Lima says the situation is still very serious, the local government has ruled out lockdowns.

“There are restriction measures to avoid social contact, but if measures are too extreme, they can have the opposite effect,” he said.

The virus has started to mutate into a new lineage. The SA/UK/Brazilian ones are all of the B lineage. That means if we get the new lineage or it mutates to a new lineage within the US, things could drastically change as they aren’t sure if vaccination or herd immunity will stop it from circumventing prior antibodies made by being infected with the B lineage and antibodies made by the vaccine. 

So I’m all for you being responsible but just keep it mind, this is rapidly changing situation that could push us back in our timeline for safe, “normal” way of life for a lot of the population. I know it’s tough, trust me, I’ve cried many days but be strong.

They stayed closed until the first week of Sept when all other places reopened in May/June. They are currently closed now to new business. Opening only a few days out of the week for existing clients only on a pre-approved basis. Not ideal but most of these businesses are privately owned, expensive to operate and can’t afford to close their doors voluntarily like we have.

""I missed this at the time, but Pfizer recently released the results from another small phase 1/2 study in Germany, where they tested the antibodies generated against a shitload of virus variants with different mutations in the RBD, and they were all neutralised just fine. Unfortunately N501Y was not tested, but one of the variants/mutations studied was N439K, which scientists have been keeping an eye on since it's also been linked to increased ACE2 binding and showed possible antibody evasion from some forms of convalescent sera. Obviously more testing needs to be done as new ones emerge, but the fact that this vaccine at least produced broadly similar and effective neutralising antibody responses to all these mutations bodes well.

It will never happen in the vast majority of Western and/or African countries.

""Why can't Britain or France or Italy or America or South Africa or Brazil just lockdown like China did, or Vietnam did?"" is an argument that doesn't realize that people are different and the French and the Americans and South Africans ARE NOT VIETNAMESE. Different traditions, cultures, etc.

So, rather than arguing against a straw man, the WHO should be honest - IF the vaccines work, we should preach the importance of hand washing, masks in large spaces and small spaces, no LARGE events, social distancing and getting as many vaccines to as many people as fast as possible so that, yes, while case counts may rise (because a lockdown in these countries was NEVER gonna happen, only in some fantasy world where the French and the Americans and Italians aren't French, Americans, and Italians) deaths should plummet since 80% of deaths are in ONE age band.

The goal should be as few deaths as possible as quickly as possible. BECAUSE once the death rate gets down to car accidents or avg flu death numbers (notwithstanding the low flu season this year due to masking, social distancing, hand washing) - then the vast majority of French, Americans, English etc. will stop wearing masks (unless their sick), large events (concerts, etc.) will return, and life will more closely resemble 2019 than 2020.

The absurdity that, as the virus has been OUT since last spring we can eradicate it WORLDWIDE rather than having the best scenario being it endemic that will kill people every year, like the flu did prior to 2020, is a hopeless fantasy that will leave them with less and less of a reputation than they already have.

Vaccine most likely does prevent both infection and transmission - we just need to generate enough data to be able to demonstrate it, since it wasn’t an end point in the original trial for obvious reasons. The vaccine is also much more likely to reduce your viral load, in the unlikely event that your (by your own admission, young and healthy) immune system wasn’t able to mount a strong enough response to fight off the virus altogether. 

So, not immunized, if you get COVID and develop large enough viral burden, you are more likely to spread it than you would be at a lower viral burden. You become a public health hazard even if you, personally, end up ok. Your dad is able to limit his exposure. You’re not. Your dad isn’t seeing a bunch patients who are at risk - you are. You’re not being vaccinated early on for your own protection. You’re being vaccinated not to become a public health hazard. 

I’m a doctor and I’m not particularly paranoid about getting COVID myself. I’m young, I’m very healthy, I never get sick, and my immune system was probably trained by now to fight off whatever random thing comes its way, after years and years of inevitable exposure. I still get flu vaccinations every year and I’ve gotten both COVID vaccines doses by now.
