The stock market has often been extremely irrational, or else we wouldn’t have crashes. Before a market crash, is it rational to be valuing stocks so high? No. In the days, weeks, months, and even a year before any given crash, the market is actually quite irrational, and it’s not possible to anticipate that coming fall from its behavior. 

The late 1990s saw a huge run-up in Internet stocks, only to crash in 2000. Similarly, a big run-up in stocks ended in the 2009 market crash. Recessions followed. To say that stocks rationally and accurately reflect the future isn’t just a naïve notion, but it’s a dangerous one as well.

One of the main reasons that stocks do not reflect the health of the economy most of us experience is the rise of stock buybacks. Companies often push stocks higher, partly and arguably, to raise the value of the stock options of their management by buying them on the open market. The 2018 tax cuts sponsored by Trump led to an inflow of cash for companies, cash that often went to buying back shares. Therefore no link to the economy, but cash sloshing around in company coffers.

But the current stock run-up, which has reached new highs, is first, and most importantly, due to the Federal Reserve injecting massive amounts of stimulus into the banking system. The Fed feared a serious recession when COVID-19 made it apparent that demand by unemployed workers would fall. 

This showed up in persistently low interest rates, and indeed the interest rates were and remain very low. When interest rates are low, stock prices are often stimulated higher for two reasons, one being because stocks are discounted by the time-value of money (which falls with rates) and the other being that people tend to put money in stocks when interest rates are so low bonds don’t have a serious payout.",,,1614223727,{},gonyms3,False,t3_lrm0ae,False,True,t1_gommrsh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lrm0ae/more_americans_now_say_academic_concerns_should/gonyms3/,1614378342,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_38qyom3,False,False,,

[],,tmleafsfan,,,,,,[],"The [European Union](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/345300Z:BB) is finally catching up in securing vaccine supplies. The challenge now is getting shots into arms.

After stumbling out of the gates, the bloc shifted into higher gear in sourcing Covid-19 vaccines and is on track to immunize its population faster than anticipated thanks to new supply pacts and increased production.

Following efforts to narrow the gap with the U.S. and Britain in a race to slow the coronavirus, the EU may be able to vaccinate 75% of its adult population by the end of August, about two months earlier than previously forecast, according to London-based research firm Airfinity Ltd.

The question now is whether member states will be able to massively ramp up vaccination and counter any pushback, mainly on the [AstraZeneca Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AZN:LN) and [University of Oxford](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/654678Z:LN) shot, which some Europeans are so far refusing to accept.

“The onus in my opinion is on member states to prove that they can manage a rapidly accelerating roll out,” said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the [Peterson Institute](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0083921D:US) for International Economics. “Will they be ready? I hope so.”

Vaccines are seen as the key to reviving stalled economies and curbing infections amid worries that new and more virulent variants could emerge. And for now, the EU’s record remains poor. The U.K., which has Europe’s highest death toll from the virus, has administered more than 27 doses per 100 people, according to Bloomberg’s tracker. That far outpaces the 6 doses for the EU. The U.S. has climbed to almost 20 doses per 100, the data show.

￼

The EU’s supply outlook has brightened recently, driven partly by [deals](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/europe-clinches-pfizer-biontech-deal-for-200-million-more-doses) with [Pfizer Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/PFE:US) and [Moderna Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MRNA:US) to secure hundreds of millions of additional doses. Already, supplies will probably double by the end of March from this month, and double again by the end of April, according to Kirkegaard, who cited projections from individual governments.

Astra on Tuesday said its forecast for vaccine deliveries to the bloc is in line with its contract with the European Commission, responding to a Reuters report on delays. The company is working on increasing productivity in its EU supply chain and using its global capability to deliver 180 million doses to the bloc in the second quarter, it said.

As supplies mount, countries are facing new pressures. In Germany, for instance, vaccination centers could soon be overwhelmed, creating a “traffic jam” unless authorities empower doctors to perform inoculations at their offices, according to the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians.

‘Remains Serious’

Officials in Brussels meanwhile warn it’s not clear whether vaccinating three-quarters of the adult population will be enough to stop the pandemic, and see a long fight ahead. That’s because mutations in the future could at least partially evade existing shots. Drugmakers have said they should be able to tweak their vaccines relatively quickly if needed.

“We need to urgently accelerate the authorization, production and distribution of vaccines, as well as vaccination,” EU leaders will declare on Thursday, according to a draft of a joint communique seen by Bloomberg. “The epidemiological situation remains serious, and the new variants pose additional challenges.”

￼

European officials have taken a series of steps in recent weeks to strengthen the bloc’s virus strategy, while several of the region’s biggest pharmaceutical companies have agreed to throw their production weight behind successful Covid shots. That’s expected to speed up supplies on the continent this summer and beyond.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told lawmakers earlier this month that she expects 300 million vaccine doses to be delivered to the bloc in the second quarter. That’s a significant increase after an estimated 18 million doses in January, 33 million in February and 55 million in March.

Picking Up

The pressure has increased as Britain -- the first country in the western world to approve a Covid inoculation -- races ahead. Britain, which decided to delay second doses of the two-shot Pfizer and Astra vaccines to speed up protection for more people, may reach the three-quarters threshold with at least a single dose by late June, according to Airfinity. Hitting that level with two doses may take another two months, only slightly ahead of the EU’s estimated timetable.

The EU’s executive [last week vowed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-16/europe-prepares-a-mutant-covid-vaccine-plan-to-fight-the-crisis) to speed up efforts to secure and deliver vaccines that combat variants, while also asking member states for more money to back the drive. The commission has already engaged in an acrimonious supply dispute with Astra amid calls by several member states to get ahead of a possible need for booster shots to tackle new mutations.

This month, the EU finalized an accord with Pfizer and German partner BioNTech for 200 million more doses and announced a major new order with Moderna for 150 million more, also for this year. With the Moderna deal, Europe has secured access to as many as 2.6 billion doses, the Commission [said Feb. 17](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_655).

“We will be able to provide vaccines not just to our citizens, but to our neighbors and partners as well,” von der Leyen said last week.

Dramatic Mobilization

The EU also has contracts with [Johnson &amp; Johnson](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/JNJ:US), [CureVac NV](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/CVAC:US) and [Sanofi](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SQ:FP) and [GlaxoSmithKline Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GSK:LN), but it’s not clear when some of those deals will pay off.

Some large drugmakers are now adding their manufacturing muscle. Paris-based Sanofi is converting facilities in Germany and France to help produce doses of the BioNTech-Pfizer shot along with the Johnson &amp; Johnson product. Switzerland’s [Novartis AG](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/NOVN:SW) has also agreed to help manufacture the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine.

Glaxo has partnered with CureVac on developing future Covid shots, while [Bayer AG](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BAYN:GR) -- which has never before made vaccines -- will start manufacturing CureVac’s existing shot, which is in late-stage trials, before the end of this year.

Higher production in Europe of the Pfizer and BioNTech shot is another key factor behind Airfinity’s outlook. Still, as shipments mount, it will be critical for EU countries to get more of their citizens inoculated.

Vaccinating the entire population, as opposed to focusing on the elderly and health-care workers, “is a different logistical operation,” Kirkegaard said. “It will require dramatic mobilization.”",,,1614223129,{},gonxg09,False,t3_lrpce4,False,False,t1_gomzn28,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lrpce4/eu_speeds_vaccine_drive_after_early_flubs_leave/gonxg09/,1614377755,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_dgkj0,False,False,,

1. We will continue to see COVID-19 infections as the virus mutates into vaccine-resistant strains, somewhat similar to the way we have different influenza strains.
2. The mRNA technology used in some vaccines facilitates rapid modification and development; combined with a streamlined regulatory approval pathway, this could be what we need not only to combat COVID-19 but also other highly transmissible viral diseases.  Someone is getting a Nobel Prize for this.
3. Public health measures such as social distancing and mask wearing are not permanent, but need to remain in place during this initial wave of vaccinations, until COVID-19 prevalence decreases to the point where it is sufficiently rare in a population that transmission to vaccinated individuals becomes extremely unlikely.  This is what is truly meant when epidemiologists use the term ""herd immunity"" and is the crux of the issue.  People are already talking about not adhering to measures to reduce transmission because they have grossly misunderstood the context in which these vaccines have demonstrated efficacy.  This is why public health officials have consistently stated that these measures must remain in place for the time being.
4. We will in fact be cycling through variant strains because of noncompliance and refusal to get this right the first time.  How bad it gets and how long we suffer depends entirely on how quickly the public understands the relationship between their individual decisions and the collective impact of those decisions.  Herd immunity is not simply a question of vaccinating a certain proportion of the population; rather, it is about having enough people vaccinated against a disease such that there is no foothold for the disease to spread.  But in this case, the disease doesn't just have a foothold; it has a stranglehold.  The prevalence rate is the other crucial component that people are ignoring, the other half of the cycle.  Vaccination reduces transmission, but it has to reduce it strongly and rapidly enough to make the likelihood of resistance sufficiently low.",,,1614284135,{},goqx3wx,False,t3_lroog3,False,True,t1_goqot4a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lroog3/moderna_ready_to_begin_testing_vaccine_that/goqx3wx/,1614431654,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_vqzf0c1,False,False,,

Five years later:  ""In-house IT costs too much! Let's outsource to China!""

This has been wibbling and wobbling for decades.  

You can absolutely find high quality IT teams in other, cheaper countries, but the harsh reality is they are not going to be the lowest bidders on your proposal, and frequently over promise and under deliver.  Good quality IT services still cost a pretty penny anywhere you go.  

Add time zone differences into the mix and it becomes a blessing and a curse.  The new team can do web maintenance for you at 1AM your time which is 11AM their time - perfect!  But when production goes down at  1PM your time.... who is on call and available?  

WFH is the compromise.

Leather

- [ ] Makeup removal wipes
- [ ] Chamberlain Leather Milk
- [x] rubbing it down with a HOT cloth that you can barely hold, along with a dab of light shampoo because it’s PH balanced for the leather

- [ ] Leather conditioner if using drying cleaners
- [x] If you use a product advertised for both cleaning and treating interior surfaces, make sure its packaging indicates it's safe for leather.
- [x] If you're going to use household cleaning wipes such as those made by Lysol or Clorox, absolutely avoid anything with bleach.
- [ ] And beware of spray disinfectants (again, Lysol), as they only work through direct contact. If you miss a spot, you may as well have not used anything at all. 


Base and legs

- [x] Warm water and mild soap
- [x] Wipe down 99.9% wipe ( If you're going to use household cleaning wipes such as those made by Lysol or Clorox, absolutely avoid anything with bleach. )

- [ ] A non-corrosive cleaner (such as glass cleaner) will work well. Use a fine automotive wax to maintain the gloss on non-textured finishes.

We’re not anywhere nears herd immunity even according to the most optimistic estimates and you’re just pulling shit out of your ass if your claiming that. We are at partial herd immunity combined likely with seasonality that lead to a big reduction in cases but if we do not reach a high level of vaccination especially with the presence of strains that reduce natural immunity we will likely see large spikes in cases/deaths/hospitalizations come the end of the summer as we saw this fall due to the seasonal nature of the virus.

Your point about it being elderly does nothing to address my argument. Anytime we have workplaces open if people want to resume normal life without risk of killing 65 year olds we need mass vaccination otherwise it will be spread from young people like myself to older people even if I’m not the direct vector of disease spread. Yo I say this stat as if I’m not supposed to care that a 65+ year old dies especially when we literally have the means to bring that number to a tiny tiny fraction of what it is now. Vaccines are highly effective but they are not full proof. The more people who are vaccinated in a workforce means it’s drastically less liekly for everyone to get sick including those who are vaccinated or those for example who cannot be vaccinated. It’s basic immunology but continue to be obtuse. So basically your opposition is not based in an actual concern for safety but a procedural issue. Second, why is it immoral for employers to mandate vaccines which are extremely safe to keep their employees safe. You just state it as if it’s a fact and I fundamentally don’t agree. Vaccines are so overwhelmingly safe I have no problem with employers, schools, etc mandating them.

On a “micro” scale, you can basically influence (but still not fully control) your OWN risk and exposure.  But that’s as far as it goes; you cannot actually influence the big picture or the ultimate outcome all that much.  With a pandemic respiratory virus, the humbling fact is that we could probably *speed it up* (and get it over with faster) if we tried—i.e. if we did literally the opposite of social distancing and had basically a giant Burning Man-style “pox party” for several weeks, we would (again theoretically, this is a thought experiment, not based on data) hasten the end of the pandemic, by vastly accelerating the first phase.  But the same does not appear to be true in reverse, at least not in terms of any metrics that actually matter.  Yes, we can spread “case counts” out over time via suppression, but that ultimately means the vulnerable are at risk of exposure for a LONGER period of time.  It also ensures we’re adding a “new batch” of medically vulnerable people almost constantly, as people’s health deteriorates from isolation, depression, inactivity, and lack of medical treatment for other conditions.

Overall...as unpopular as this still is...there’s a REASON the WHO, CDC, and every other public health organization had detailed pandemic management plans in place, that emphasized *keeping society running as normally as possible*.  Turns out—as with so many things—a moderate, middle-of-the-road approach works better and has a better outcome than either extreme (extremes being deliberate pox party on one side and disease eradication on the other).

[],,loggic,,,,,,[],"The reason why they're all considered ""strains of concern"" is because they're all exhibiting distinct lineages of mutations to things that are likely to impact the disease's behavior, such as the binding site on the spike protein. 

Even if these mutations *all* only impacted the spike protein, they would still all be distinct. Grossly over simplifying: a mutation that makes the spike longer is different than a mutation that makes the spike wider, and the viral effect of both mutations together may be very different than either by itself.

[This](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/science-and-research/scientific-brief-emerging-variants.html) is the CDC page describing them a bit, but the information they provide is still not stellar.

One reason the SA variant is concerning is because the various studies that have been conducted indicate that it is pretty effective at evading the antibody response. Initial data shows that people who have been infected previously by the initial lineage or received the AstraZeneca vaccine have no significant extra protection from mild to moderate cases. The study done in South Africa officially found 10% protection, but the uncertainty margin made that nearly indistinguishable from 0. That study didn't have enough data to evaluate whether the vaccine protected against severe cases, but even so they abandoned use of that vaccine.

Each ""strain"" is a unique set of mutations, each with their own impact.

The CA strain appears to be resistant to antibodies, but to a lesser degree than the SA variant. This lineage is distinct from the SA variant, achieving similar things with different methods.

The UK variant is more effective at hijacking the ACE-2 receptor, which is why it is generally more transmissible &amp; more severe, but also likely why existing antibodies / vaccines afford significant protection.

Etc.

They are absolutely not substantially similar, otherwise they wouldn't be considered distinct strains. The ""wild type"" virus also has all sorts of mutations, but we don't differentiate them because we don't have any reason to believe those mutations significantly impact virus behavior. Similarly, the ""California variant"" is technically 2 distinct but functionally similar mutation groups, so it is just considered a single variant.

**TL;DR** When the mutations don't result in functional differences, we don't consider them to be distinct strains of concern. Every one of the ""strains of concern"" has something that makes it functionally unique from all other known variants.",,,1614292816,{},gorhqvm,False,t3_ls57g1,False,True,t1_gor85v2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ls57g1/we_need_to_prepare_for_the_possibility_that/gorhqvm/,1614441166,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_8d3vu,False,False,,

Society makes it way too easy to become obese by removing all the consequences. Shoot, Reddit removed /fatpeoplehate because of hurt feelings! If you want to be obese, nearly every obstacle or piece of negative feedback has been removed from society. You don't even have to feel bad about it! Yay!

My spouse is an active duty military person. We moved to Washington in Spring of 2019 for their job.

All of my “good friends” and family are 2,000 miles away. I haven’t seen any of them since September 2019, which is the last time I visited home before the pandemic began. Traveling during the pandemic has been too risky. 

If we lived within driving distance, I’m sure there would have been masked outdoor meetups with our friends.

Flights are cheap, but I’m not willing to risk the health of my friends and family by hopping on a flight and seeing them right away.

You are telling ME an active gym goer, that working out at home is the same?  Get real, unless I dumped loads of cash. Found a place to put the shit ill never be able to do what I do at the gym here in my house. That's a fact.  

I know plenty of people who have had bad circumstances happen.  You called it traditional injury.  Everything you listed there is the exact opposite of common or aka traditional.  Bad stuff happens but to most average people.  They will not be faced with a life long permanent injury or health issue.  Im not going to feel bad that I like most average people are of ok health.   Maybe one day it changes and that will suck.  But I'd never ask for anyone to feel bad about being ok.  

There's a lot you dont know about random people on the internet.  You don't know the people I've lost, the things I've sacrificed.

2. Safety testing (whether the vaccine won't hurt you) had to be long because it could have side effects that manifest months after taking the vaccine. 

As far as I know the second part is the limiting factor in most cases. And it's still a compromise, what if side effects show up after two years? We can't know that, it's highly unlikely but not impossible. So we decide on a reasonable balance between risk of long-term side effects and benefit to public safety.

Two, practice - we've seen strains emerge that were concerning, Moderna is smart to start figuring out how to make boosters against variants today so the process is faster and more optimized. See also how long it took to get the current vaccines done, approved, and mass produced (they are STILL ramping up).  


Three, they're testing a few other things, like if giving half the vaccine quantity is as effective or not - if we could literally use half the vaccine, we could vaccinate a ton of people much more quickly. They're even testing if a third dose later of the current vaccine protects well against variants by boosting antibodies. In a word, science.

Four, money and the stock market. The market responds to growth potential more than anything, there's lots of fear of variants, why not combine the two and announce ""We're on this - we will be a solution if this is a problem!""

Basically, there's zero reason not to. Remember Moderna has never had an approved product before now and there was doubt whether they ever would. Now they're a huge portion of vaccinations in the US and will be globally - this is a market for them.

Coming from working covid for a YEAR straight as a healthcare worker, I despise the “good news” media coverage about the virus. It makes all of us groan and pull our hair out. But I have my reasons.

The biggest reason? We’ve had so much disinformation spread about it in the news and so many false starts and premature declarations of “the end” to this pandemic, that I feel reporting on positive progress almost certainly and instantly results in an equally negative spike later on. The very first question we get from people and patients is always “So does this mean I don’t have to wear a mask anymore?” Or the statement: “I’m so excited to plan a big get together with everyone I’ve missed” 

Currently, 15% of the state of California is vaccinated and that’s including people who only received one dose. Experts say 85% of citizens have to be vaccinated in order for the pandemic to be controlled. For context, only 51% of citizens get the flu vaccine. Even AFTER 85% of the citizens are vaccinated, we must maintain the same level of precautions until we’ve successfully created vaccine boosters to sustain immunity and protect against new variants.

When California first closed down and cases had  the healthcare system overwhelmed in April 2020, the daily new case average was 1,500. Even AFTER the deadly spike November-January ended, our daily new case average this week is 6,218. That’s FOUR times higher than when we first went into state of emergency and lock down. I honestly believe this is due to statistical fatigue. Yeah the numbers are drastically better. They’re also several times higher than when the pandemic first began. 

California has closed and reopened so. many. times. And it’s gotten worse every time. Positive reinforcement is great and all, but in my experience, I have not seen it taken responsibly. 

Also, I don’t believe many people are aware, that any time the covid statistics improve, we LOSE a significant amount of resources we need to maintain or advance the improvement because “there’s no need, the demand is down.” This includes reopening counties, closing alternative care sites, reducing emergency healthcare worker staffing, closing testing sites, losing federal and state supply aids, and losing federal and state funding. Prematurely. 

Positive Covid news almost ALWAYS trashes all of our hard work and progress and it drives us mad. We’re not all negative nancies who want to be miserable, we’re saying it’s not better since it began. It’s worse. It’s not over. Stop letting your guard down. There is not enough improvement for reason to celebrate right now and a lot of us won’t celebrate until it’s actually over. We’ve worked for too long and seen too many people die.

I do disagree with the masking and distancing were always about health care capacity. Yes that is part of it, but it is also about decreasing spread of the disease. Especially now when we are so close to getting people vaccinated. Every death (3,200 yesterday) is going to be preventable once we get enough vaccinations. We can’t act like everything is back to normal because 10% of the population is vaccinated. Our covid deaths now are worse then they were over the summer. 

From a personal standpoint I got vaccinated in dec/jan. I still wear a mask seeing patients and at stores. 1/20 is not 100%, and I would feel horrible if I got one of my patients sick. I am going to see my parents who are also vaccinated in a few weeks. If they are ok with it then I am not going to wear a mask because low risk of me combined with low risk of them. I think the problem we have right now is that there are a lot of people that haven’t gotten the vaccine so the low risk from one side of the equation is not perfect. My expectation is that things will be a lot better by July.

However, it has been generally accepted that it does occur, especially in closed indoor settings. Consequently, there's a possibility that air conditioning may be a potential route of transmission — sucking in virus particles breathed out by an infected person and then blowing those infectious particles back out in the same room or even another room several floors away.***](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/08/15/897147164/can-air-conditioners-spread-covid-19)

&gt; In fact, other infectious diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, chickenpox, influenza, smallpox and SARS have all been shown to spread through heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems.

...

https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/06/air-conditioning-may-be-factor-in-covid-19-spread-in-the-south/

&gt; Drawing on insights from another deadly airborne disease, tuberculosis, a Harvard infectious disease expert suggested Friday that air conditioning use across the southern U.S. may be a factor in spiking COVID-19 cases and that ultraviolet lights long used to sterilize the air of TB bacteria could do the same for SARS-CoV-2.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412020317876

&gt; Inhaling small airborne droplets is probable as a third route of infection, in addition to more widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. 

https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/indoor-air-and-coronavirus-covid-19

&gt; Evidence now confirms that this virus can remain airborne for longer times and further distances than originally thought. In addition to close contact with infected people and contaminated surfaces, spread of COVID-19 may also occur via airborne particles in indoor environments, in some circumstances beyond the 2 m (about 6 ft) range encouraged by some social distancing recommendations.

https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ventilation-and-air-conditioning

&gt; All air conditioning and industrial ventilation systems for both residential and high occupancy buildings (government buildings, schools, hotels, and hospitals) should be inspected, maintained, and cleaned regularly to prevent transmission. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7182754/

&gt; Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Systems (HVAC) are used as a primary infection disease control measure. However, if not correctly used, they may contribute to the transmission/spreading of airborne diseases as proposed in the past for SARS.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7520710/

&gt; This shift in emphasis has come to the fore during the present COVID-19 pandemic, driven by the possibility of infectious aerosols being carried around a building by the ventilation system (Kim et al. 2020; Lu et al. 2020; Morawska &amp; Milton 2020; Stadnytskyi et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020). A number of outbreaks in confined indoor crowded spaces such as offices, churches, restaurants, ski resorts, shopping centres, worker dormitories, cruise ships and vehicles indicate that virus transmission is particularly efficient in these types of indoor environments (Leclerc et al. 2020).

Covid-19 vaccine from Novavax proved nearly 90% effective in preliminary results from a key clinical trial in the United Kingdom, the company said, but in a separate trial appeared far less effective against a new variant of the coronavirus that was first identified in South Africa.

In its 15,000-volunteer U.K. trial, Novavax said, the vaccine prevented nine in 10 cases, including against a new strain of the virus that is circulating there. But in a 4,400-volunteer study in South Africa, the vaccine proved only 49% effective. In the 94% of the study population that did not have HIV, the efficacy was 60%. 

In the U.K. trial, Novavax observed 62 cases of symptomatic Covid-19, with 56 in the placebo group and six among volunteers who got the vaccine. One patient on placebo developed severe Covid-19, compared with zero in the vaccine group. The company provided few details on the vaccine’s safety, saying only that the serious side effects were rare and balanced between the studies’ vaccine and placebo groups.

In the South African study, 29 cases of symptomatic Covid-19 were observed in the placebo group, and 15 in the vaccine group.

It's also reasonable with the time frame that is left within the school year for teachers to ask for a vaccination before going back in person.

[],,lovememychem,#94e044,,28b4e296-5e4b-11ea-aa9a-0edecd70770b,MD/PhD Student,dark,[],"That breakdown is a bit challenging to make, for reasons that Helen Branswell at [STAT News](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/02/comparing-the-covid-19-vaccines-developed-by-pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson/) outlines well. The relevant passage:

&gt; But comparing efficacy in those vaccines to the efficacy of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s is challenging because of differences in the designs of the Phase 3 clinical tests — essentially the trials were testing for different outcomes. Pfizer’s and Moderna’s trials were testing for slightly different criteria, with Pfizer counting cases from seven days after receipt of the second dose of vaccine and Moderna waiting till day 14 to start counting cases. Both tested for any symptomatic Covid infection.

&gt; J&amp;J, by contrast, sought to determine whether one dose of its vaccine protected against moderate to severe Covid illness — defined as a combination of a positive test and at least one symptom such as shortness of breath, beginning from 14 or 28 days after the single shot. (The company collected data for both.) 

&gt; Because of the difference in the trials, making direct comparisons is a bit like comparing apples and oranges. Additionally, Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines were tested before the emergence of troubling new variants in Britain, South Africa, and Brazil. It’s not entirely clear how well they will work against these mutated viruses.

&gt; The J&amp;J vaccine was still being tested when the variants were making the rounds. Much of the data generated in the South African arm of the J&amp;J trial involved people who were infected with the variant first seen in South Africa, called B.1.351.

&gt; The J&amp;J one-dose vaccine was shown to be 66% protective against moderate to severe Covid infections overall from 28 days after injection, though there was variability based on geographic locations. The vaccine was 72% protective in the United States, 66% protective in South America, and 57% protective in South Africa.

Or my favorite are the ""stay distant and close down businesses because it's not controlled in other countries yet"" as if the virus in Turkey matters if I can go to the gym in the bay area.


Then the wonderful replies about how easy it all is...or feigned sympathy from cozy work from home jobs with full families as they berate anyone from seeing friends and family, blissful ignorant of the horrible impact the mitigation (however needed it was before) has had on others.

I love, absolutely love, that this sub has started to hit its breaking point with restrictions. 

I've had assholes in here call me a plague rat because I simply work in an industry that relies on bars and restaurants being open, now the shoe is on the other foot and it's scary? Did the idea that people can't sustain this another few months let alone the rest of the year really not cross anyone's minds here? That ""minimal precaution"" is a personal trainer or group workout class instructor's way of fucking survival. That bar that gets shit talked for being open is someone's hard work and how someone else pays rent. 

I hope to my service industry brothers and sisters remember how we were treated....how we were talked down to for so much as pointing out the negative impact the restrictions had on us and our livelihoods. The Lockdown forever types aren't ""in this together"" like they claim, they're privileged and selfish, they only care if the virus kills or makes someone sick, and couldn't give a fuck about the economic ruin some of us have been left in.

Oh and the other good one: ""well then blame your government for not taking care of you"" as a justification why all this should continue years longer, maybe some of us actually really liked our jobs, maybe a year fucking long of missed contacts and events is going to damage our client base for years to come. But yeah, a constant stimmy is enough to make up for all the rest of the non monetary damage..... 


Look, I get it. This had to happen. It sucks...and those who died got it way, WAY, worse than those of us who have lost so much financially. But the utter dismissal of the negative consequences of the shut down and distancing orders is really fucking irresponsible. We need a clear exit strategy, we need some promises that we won't be attempting a ""zero COVID"" strategy that will take years of economic and mental ruin to achieve.

Even if they are, they are still breathing heavily. Covid lingers in the air and if people are inside of a gym for a prolonged period of time they can get exposed. 

This isn't according to me. It's just how the virus spreads. Go take it up with covid. 

You can exercise without a gym. A gym isn't ""the best"" way to do it. Go talk to any doctor and ask them what the optimal workout is in terms of endorphins and physical health. 99% guarantee they will tell you a brisk walk is enough. Or any type of movement that you can do at home through an online class or YouTube video. 

Sympathy for those that go to a gym? That is hilarious. I used to be a gym rat myself pre-covid. Went every day. Didn't like that I couldn't go anymore. Found an alternative. Made the best of it. So heck no I don't feel sorry for anyone in my situation because I know from personal experience how easy it is to work out without a gym. I never in my life ever went jogging outside before covid. But guess what I had to do when covid hit? Jog outside. I never took online classes before covid. Guess what I do now? Online workout programs. Streaming classes. Crossfit online instead of in person. Physically I am MORE in shape than ever before. My cardio is 10x what is used to be. 

If you want to know who I have sympathy for its for the people that were hospitalized or died from covid, for their families. I have sympathy for my friends in the medical field that worked under severe stress over the last year taking care of covid patients and who now have to deal with the mental trauma of what they saw. I have sympathy for people who get diseases out of nowhere. I have friends that were diagnosed with autoimmune diseases and cancer. So yes, I have sympathy for them. 

But people who are spoiled who refuse to work out outside of a gym temporarily because its too much of an inconvenience during a pandemic? NOPE.

Nobody said anything about staying inside forever. Not even staying inside. Heck, I spend half my weekend out on hikes and running outdoors. And yes I would rather be safe than get covid or a covid variant. I'm going to take precautions even after I get vaccinated due to the unknowns of all of the variants.

There are plenty of athletes out there who got covid and can no longer work out. So if there is one thing you should do if you are a gym goer its to be extra extra careful because covid can result in long term symptoms that can affect your future ability to exercise.",,,1614235710,{},goohulj,False,t3_lrqygk,False,True,t1_googqw9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lrqygk/cdc_traces_covid_outbreaks_in_gyms_urging/goohulj/,1614388098,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_7lg2t8n7,False,False,,

&gt;**Flu vaccination has been shown in several studies to reduce severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick.**

I.E. If you were in the unlucky 60%-40%, and you got exposed to the flu, you are less likely to die, less likely to go to the ICU, etc. thanks to your vaccine.

Parents will send their children that are vomiting to school during regular times, you think for a low grade fever they will keep them home? Absolutely not. 

I get we need to go back to school, but we also haven't done things like cut classroom sizes, hire more teachers, buy more building space so we can actually be distant, etc etc etc.

Highlighting the challenge of raising kids, one which many are experiencing right now as they home school while working from home, is a great example of sacrifice. 

If you label calling out the dangers of a deadly virus, supporting what the CDC has said regarding gyms, and stating facts ""belittling"" then that is your problem, not mine. 

You have pity on me? That's funny and reflects your immaturity. 

You are telling ME that working out at home isn't the same? I'm someone that works out at home and was a former gym goer. You are talking to the wrong person here if you are trying to prove that point to me. 

Everyone is dealing with situations right now that just aren't ""the same"". 

You don't know the medical issues people deal with. I do, trust me. I know people that have been permanently injured to a point where they have limited mobility. Or suffer other health issues that limit what they can do. I know someone that developed severe asthma and can no longer run because of it. There is a lot you don't know about this world and the struggles that many, many people face. Be fortunate for your good health. 

Do what you want to do, but the point of this thread was to highlight the dangers of gyms. And instead of people acknowledging this reality, there are a whole lot of people complaining about how terrible it was/is to not go to the gym. Meanwhile, people have been hospitalized and dying of covid. Doctors and nurses have been working tirelessly for months and risking their lives taking care of covid patients. Parents have had their lives taken away from them as they juggle parenthood + work + homeschooling. So it strikes me as odd that anyone would complain about not being able to work out.

If enough people got vaccinated then we could in theory prevent the flu even been able to start up. Flu vaccines are actually extremely effective at preventing direct strain transmission I.e if someone with Australian flu strain coughed in your face after you’ve had the vaccine at beginning of flu season it’s very likely you won’t get sick. What causes the issue though is that people don’t get vaccinated so the flu bounced around the population and mutates insanely fast nullifying the vaccine. Luckily though, vaccines have many super powers, one being that it can weaken strains that have mutated outside of its protection zone.

The move will mean the closure of bars and restaurants for three weeks next month.

The government has announced closures of bars and restaurants and expanded remote learning among other measures intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

At a press conference on Thursday morning, Prime Minister Sanna Marin (SDP) announced that parts of the country currently in the ""acceleration"" and ""spreading"" stages of the pandemic would move to tier two of the government's three-tier Covid-19 prevention plan.

Marin said that daycare and early years education providers would remain open, as would schools up to grade six. Grades 7-9 and Upper Secondary school pupils, along with those aged over 16 in vocational education, will switch to remote learning.

Indoor hobbies will be suspended for adults and children aged over 12.

Affected areas would also see a ban on group leisure activities for those aged over 12 years old as well as restrictions on gatherings of more than six people.

Helsinki and Uusimaa hospital district (HUS) as well as hospital districts in the regions of Kanta-Häme, Southwest Finland, Satakunta and Vaasa are currently in the community transmission or ""spreading"" stage, according to information from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL).

March shutdown

The prime minster said the state of the pandemic in Finland had worsened since Christmas, due in part to the spread of the highly-infectious British variant of the virus.

Around three-quarters of confirmed cases in Finland are now thought to be the British strain of coronavirus.

""The tools previously available to us are no longer enough to control the situation,"" Marin said.

Citing the seriousness of the situation, the prime minister also announced a three-week closure of pubs, bars and restaurants to take place from 8-22 March.

Legislation on the closures and compensation due to businesses would be presented to parliament next week, Marin said.

Interior Minister Maria Ohisalo (Green) defended the government's decision, saying ""It is the government's job to ensure that we provide support both to people and to various sectors to overcome the crisis. With tight restrictions, we can speed up the return to a more normal daily life.""

(disclaimer: mainly for warmer areas like CA, AZ, etc)

I've seen that a lot of warmer areas right now have outdoor gym offerings -- like, a bunch of equipment is outdoors and things are pretty well-spaced out. (obviously, some gyms are better about this than others)

It's obviously not going to completely stop the spread, but since:

* It's been established that outdoor activity is a much, much lower risk factor for COVID spread than anything indoors
* Surface transmission is actually very minimal

I feel like this is a _reasonable_ path to mitigating a lot of the risk of going to the gym in a pandemic.

I wouldn't touch an indoor gym with a 10-foot pole though, even with capacity restrictions.

1. The often quoted \~95% efficacy rate for the mRNA vaccines are calculated in the context of the conduct of participants in the original Phase 3 trials, not under the circumstances you are proposing.  What I mean is that the study participants were blinded to treatment, therefore could not assume that they actually received vaccine.  They were also participating during a time when there were widespread restrictions on social activities as well as enforcement of social distancing and mask wearing.  Also, the prevalence of virus in the population at the time was arguably lower than it is currently, with fewer variant strains in the wild.  Consequently, the efficacy rate cannot be assumed to remain the same under conditions in which there is no distancing or mask wearing.
2. Collectively, the potential for vaccine-resistant mutations to develop, and the rate at which they develop, will increase as a function of increased contact between infected and vaccinated individuals.  On a personal level, this may not mean much to you, but on a population-wide scale, it is a risk that cannot be ignored.  This pandemic has made it abundantly clear that placing the desires of the individual over the safety of the many is precisely why, one year later, there continues to be widespread transmission.

In closing, it is not my intent to chastise or judge; yours is, after all, a very natural and understandable point of view that is very common.  However, it remains flawed for the above reasons, as well as others.  The media and government (specifically, public health agencies) have, as usual, been utterly abysmal at communicating with the public and educating them on the science.

At a minimum, changes to the HVAC systems to increase ventilation and filtering, increased cleanings and sanitation in the building, temperature screenings when entering buildings, quarantining anyone exposed to someone who tests positive, mandatory face masks, these kinds of things. I know it's basically impossible to keep students separated six feet apart. At the high school I went to, the hallways were shoulder to shoulder in between classes. Classroom sizes have continued to grow while the budgets for education have not, and there's no money available in any schools budget to do any of this stuff (for the most part). 

This does not require binary thinking though. We're not choosing between closing the schools entirely or having them fully open with normal operations. Some classes really can be taught remotely. Others not so much (such as labs). You could also alternate days so that some of the students are in class on Mondays and Wednesdays, and other students are in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Fridays can be reserved for activities that require students to be present and everyone else learns from home. 

You could also make changes to the school schedule so that it's open for a longer number of hours a day and you give more time for people to get from class to class in groups. Instead of the bell ringing and 2000 students piling into the hallways all of the same time to shove past each other to get to the next class, you could instead have them released in alternate classrooms. they go to their lockers and get the books for the next class and convene in a common area (like the big cafeteria or something) where there's room for people to spread out a little bit. Then the next bell rings and the second batch of students gets out and goes on to the class. Then a third bell ring so the students who are waiting now go on to their classes. Thus reducing the clutter in the hallways and making it with people don't have to cram together quite so tightly.

I'm not saying all these ideas are great or even practical, but there are some changes that can be made to make things a little more safe one change at a time. If you can reduce the chance of spread then that gives you more time to catch infected people as they become symptomatic, and it minimizes the number of people that symptomatic person could have infected. There's no way (as you said) to make something perfectly safe, but we can improve it some to slow the spread rate and give us time.

And of course any student with a pre-existing health condition or a family member who is especially vulnerable should be allowed to distance learn as much as possible.

The reason the US and UK are ahead is also down to the fact that both governments held a more collaborative relationship with the manufacturers right from the start including giving stronger commitments way back in June, building up domestic supply lines in advance, providing rolling reviews of the trials and approving it faster than almost anyone else. These facts were also likely to be included in the contract - in return for this level of collaboration, the UK put its own population first for AstraZeneca. That's not the same as having export controls which is far more punitive. This was collaborative and pragmatic. Besides, the EMA only approved the AstraZeneca vaccine a few weeks back by which point the US and UK were already miles ahead.

Secondly, comparing when Denmark (5m) completes its drive to when the UK (60m) isn't a valid comparison. It's a smaller population within a developed country so of course it's going to be quick. Denmark and countries of that population size should compare themselves to Israel and the UAE. The UK's benchmark is France, Germany and Italy due to their similarly sized populations and economies.

Thirdly, I think it's premature to suggest the EU is doing better than Australia, Japan and Canada. All those countries have been relatively less impacted with Covid and therefore the urgency of the vaccination drive is lower. Certainly both Australia and Japan are waiting and watching.

Lastly, your point about comparing Scotland wanting to leave with a member state wanting to leave is wrong. Scotland is a constituent member of a nation state. The EU is a quasi-international body - leaving one and not the other is not a fair comparison. How about comparing Scotland leaving to Bavaria leaving Germany? Or Catalunya leaving Spain.

Think about Fauci and others in similar positions: Everyone on this sub (well, not everyone, that's hyperbole) wants a clear solid timeline for reopening - and many believe no matter what, we're never going to be allowed to go back to normal. 

  
The reality is more complicated. ""Fauci says you cannot hug grandma!"" - in reality, Fauci's not gonna say Grandma is safe because you're vaccinated until he's SURE. That's a scientist. 

&amp;#x200B;

Same reason we see vaccines ramping and most adults vaccinated by summer but hear ""We may have maskes through 2022!"" - because they do not know what could happen, and they are able to see scenarios where that's the reality.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone right now is so concerned that they'll admit things are getting better because they know that could theoretically change - a variant etc - or that it could make people suddenly throw off their masks and throw parties before we have enough vaccinations.   


I didn't say I agree with their messaging, but I do think the conspiracy theories we see about perpetual lockdowns and scientists ""enjoying"" our ""new normal"" are portly because people don't understand - can't comprehend - the actual reasons they say what they say.

[],,Deckard_Paine,,,,,,[],"The British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is doing everything it can to increase the production of its corona vaccine. CEO Pascal Soriot tried to convince the European Parliament of this during a hearing. His explanation of why the delivery of the vaccines in the UK is so much smoother than in the EU did not appeal to MEPs.

On Thursday, parliament had invited representatives of the seven companies with which the European Commission has concluded contracts for the supply of corona vaccines. ""This is a world first,"" said the chairman of the Public Health Committee, Frenchman Pascal Canfin, at the start.

Most of the attention went to AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot. His company supplies significantly fewer vaccines than agreed with the Commission, while deliveries to the UK seem to be going smoothly. ""The reason supply is lower than expected is actually simple: production is lower,"" explained Soriot. ""The production of our vaccine is a biological process and that requires a learning phase.""

While production is increasing rapidly in one site, it is slower in another. ""Our experts go from site to site and are doing the maximum right now. But we are confident that productivity will soar from the second quarter, ""said Soriot. AstraZeneca now produces around 100 million doses per month, which should be double that from April.

Europe was ahead of the British with vaccine deal
Contracts

Regarding the contracts with the United Kingdom and with the European Union, he said that the British government became involved in the vaccine that was to be developed together with Oxford University in January / February 2020. London also invested in that development, while the European Union, according to Soriot, was only pumping money into production.

He stated that a production site in the Netherlands was originally reserved for the British market, but now also produces for the EU. ""Regardless, the vast majority of vaccines produced in the EU are now going to the European market,"" it said. With around 65 million people living in the UK and 450 million in the EU, even a complete transfer of UK production to Europe wouldn't make much difference, Soriot noted.

His explanation failed to convince MEPs. ""You are just like a bar of soap: impossible to get a grip on,"" said Finnish Silvia Modig (far left). According to Esther de Lange (CDA), the story of Soriot rattles from all sides. ""If the UK and EU contracts were signed practically at the same time, why is there 60 percent less deliveries in the EU? Soriot still didn't want to explain that even today, ""she told Dutch media.

According to the Belgian Sara Matthieu (Groen), Soriot's explanation also excelled in vagueness. ""I mainly heard that all pharmaceutical companies are trying to increase their capacity, but (heard) little concrete perspective. However, the solution is obvious. When these companies temporarily forgo their patents and share know-how, manufacturers around the world can produce vaccines. ""

**Moderna**

In addition to AstraZeneca, Moderna has also been under fire in recent weeks for lagging deliveries. Flemish Minister of Health Wouter Beke (CD&amp;V) said last week that he knew ""nothing but misery"" with the company. Ceo Stéphane Bancel told MPs on Thursday that it was clear to him from the outset that the large-scale supply of corona vaccines would prove to be the biggest challenge.

""Because every dose of a vaccine is critical in a pandemic, we don't store anything. Then every obstacle, such as a pump that breaks or a human error is made, immediately leads to fewer deliveries.

You literally just got done telling everybody else to just 'go get a different job.'  Why doesn't that apply to you?  


&gt; The only way we’re going to get to the necessary herd immunity and reduce spread in work places is for employers to mandate it. 

Categorically incorrect.  We're at or very near HIT right now in broad swaths of the country.  It's why the extreme downward case and hospitalization trends started weeks before widespread vaccine availability.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; It’s not blind hysteria. 

It's the textbook definition of blind hysteria.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Covid is a deadly disease 

For a very specific subset of the population.  Here in Oklahoma, for example, over 95% of the deaths have been people over 60 with serious comorbidities.  Over 40% were in EOL care in LTCs.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  that greatly reduces the risk of spreading or contracting covid. 

Sort of defeating your own argument here.  If YOU are scared and YOU get the vaccine, then YOU are protected.  That has nothing to do with me.  Nothing.

But we want to talk about being shitty to others? OK in game. I work in the public sector with bars and restaurants, do plenty of work with large events too, obviously that work has been shuttered. Unfortunate but ultimately had to happen. 


What didn't have to happen? Pieces of shit who get to work from home all over this site and others talking about me and others like me like were plague rats simply because of our industry. These same POS will come in and demand things from us, and out of the other side of their mouths say we should stay shut for however long it takes while they sit on their asses in cushy work from home programming jobs or whatever. 

Quack experts so goddam out of touch that they go on news stations or write articles talking about a ""new normal"" (the most fucking idiotic set of words of the last year) or straight faced say we need to distance and close businesses for years to come. Where's the concern for our livelihoods? Our lives? Oh that's right, people who write posts like yours don't actually give a shit about us do you? Our plight doesn't matter, only thing that matters is people getting sick from the virus.

Oh unless someone gets to use us as an example to rail on capitalism or some other weird grievance they have that has nothing to do with COVID, then they ""care"", whatever. 

I have been taking it seriously the last year, as much as you probably don't think that, I actually have. But I'm getting close to being done. If I'm going to be treated like shit because I work with the public, if dining coming back means people say it's ""immoral"" for me to literally do my fucking job I have to pay my bills (this actually happened recently, yes apparently I was supposed to ""take a stand"" against reopening) 

I'll mask if a place asks for it, that's their right. If I'm around friends after I'm Vaccinated and no one wants to wear a mask, I won't make them and I won't let them make me. I won't tolerate distancing once I'm vaccinated. I will be seeing others, a lot. I also will remember what the governmental reopening plan is for business...my vote will be allocated accordingly. And if my clients start doing speakeasy style business? I won't report them if that's what it takes to survive.

By simply brushing it off as less than the main cause of transmission without informing of what the actual transmissibility is from fomites it creates a significant gap in confidence of understanding how this is spread and results in people taking the most cautious action.

I'm not saying that I believe fomite transmission is a significant portion of infections, just trying to explain why people are behaving the way they are.

Problem is, that Hamilton spin class probably told their clients the same thing - and again, that was in October, when we already knew a lot about the way covid spreads. I used to go to the gym every day after work, but I stopped it and got some weights for home exercise instead: not quite the same, but I won't get infected by any heavy breathers.

Well actually, yes. My point was that it doesn't make sense to directly compare total lives lost between driving vs COVID - because there is much more going into the numbers.

&gt;And that's without getting into the fact that on the one hand you're taking a personal risk, and on the other you're jeopardizing others. Those stats don't exclude deaths from drunk driving, which are a fraction of the 38k mentioned. Do you think we should open season on drunk driving too as a personal decision?

I'm genuinely a little lost here on the point you're trying to make. Both driving and engaging in society while COVID wanes entail risks personal risks as well as potential impact to others. Obviously no one is rationally arguing for drunk diving, or against other driving restrictions/safety measures for that matter. In the same manner, some restrictions should still be followed and gradually lessened as the vaccination roll-out continues.

&gt;Careless analysis with an emphasis on indifference to human life, since it will impact others more than it will you. Fantastic.

Nope, not at all. I'm 100% against careless, free-for-all reopening without considering the science behind things. But there's strong reason to believe that we're quickly approaching the point where it is reasonably safe for others to begin resuming certain activities, especially when they present minimal transmission risk.

Perhaps an academic point, but this particular point isn't true. A lot of epidemics get contained because we figure out ways to reduce spread rather than reaching herd immunity. Hemorrhagic fever epidemics have been contained by contact tracing, quarantine, increased use of PPE, and public education campaigns about how to avoid contracting/spreading them. Cholera epidemics have been contained by treating drinking water and educating people on how to avoid contamination of drinking water. COVID is super hard and costly to contain because it spreads super easily as well as asymptomatically/presymptomatically and containment measures are a huge economic and emotional and physical health burden, and it's also not nearly as deadly as hemorrhagic fevers, so of course with that tradeoff most people aren't as willing to subject themselves to the long term extreme measures required to contain it - which frankly is unobjectionable to me. But if COVID had like 20% fatality rate instead of less than 1%, you bet your ass we would be willing to take very extreme measures for months or years or however long it takes to contain it instead of waiting to reach herd immunity and killing off tens of millions of people in the process.

That said, it's silly to imagine all it would have taken was a few months of mask wearing or whatever in the summer and then we would be done with COVID forever.

As democracies, we expect to be treated well, or we should expect that, because we have the power to change it and that’s how strong democracies tend to work. Anything less and the power of the ruling class wanes. That’s literally the main side effect of a strong, stable democracy, and when that stops happening, it’s gradually becoming a weaker or non democracy.

[],,Reference_Freak,,,,,,[],"Locking down works to reduce cases by reducing transmission opportunities. If a person normally interacts with 50 people a day and lock down cuts that to 10 with masking and distancing further limiting chances for spread, that’s a significant reduction of opportunities for transmission. So, no, it’s not naive to try to reduce spread via lock downs. 

More contagious variants just up the spread under the same circumstances other variants spread; it doesn’t magically spread.

The new variants make reducing spread more critically necessary to prevent more surges of people infected all at the same time. Does that lengthen the pandemic? Sure but it saves millions of lives. 

Consider: if every infected person could receive all the medical care necessary to survive, the death rate is probably under 2%, possibly under 1% in healthier populations.

However, if ICU/respiratory support is limited, the death rate passes 10%; roughly a third of all cases need medical support. While many might approve of shrugging of 10+% of the national or global population, it would absolutely devastate our medical systems and mortuary industries and leave severe impacts on every other industry including food processing and distribution. You like paying $9 bucks for a pound of beef? Enjoyed the tp shortages of 2020?

 Plus you wanna tell our nation’s kids to suck it up and wave goodbye to grandma and grandpa via Zoom? Grandparents do a lot of important things for families lucky enough to have them. Then there are the random 20-50 somethings who would succumb, all unnecessary deaths, and while, yes, they are all gonna die anyway, the modern economy is based on folks living productive lives into their 60s and continuing to spend money well past their 70s.   


Prolonging the pandemic via shutdowns is annoying, painful, and economically bad, however, rushing to ”herd immunity“ via rapid infection spread to try to preserve the economy would be **way** more destructive.

Because we haven't established that at all. Because it's not true. 

Have a look at this link: [https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1364963354176090113](https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1364963354176090113)

&gt; Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that it is allowing undiluted frozen vials of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to be transported and stored at conventional temperatures commonly found in pharmaceutical freezers for a period of up to two weeks. This reflects an alternative to the preferred storage of the undiluted vials in an ultra-low temperature freezer between -80ºC to -60ºC (-112ºF to -76ºF). The change is being reflected in updates to the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers).

This alternative temperature for transportation and storage of the undiluted vials is significant and allows the vials to be transported and stored under more flexible conditions. The alternative temperature for transportation and storage will help ease the burden of procuring ultra-low cold storage equipment for vaccination sites and should help to get vaccine to more sites,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.


&gt; Pfizer Inc. submitted data to the FDA to demonstrate that their COVID-19 vaccine remains stable after storage of the undiluted vials for up to two weeks at standard freezer temperature.

I wish that a lot of local gyms and city/county jurisdictions (including mine) would not order to exclusively wear masks while working out (at least in my case, the gym I occasionally go to makes people sit 6 ft apart per treadmill and other station) 

It's one thing to wear a mask at a mall, but I feel out of breath as soon as I do any sort of cardio activity for an extended period of time, and they fog up my glasses, and they always end up getting sweaty to wear I have to keep replacing them. 

I know someone is going to respond and be like ""Uh actually studies show you don't lose oxygen so **** you and suck it up. Stop acting like a little ***** and wear the ******* mask."" Those studies may indeed be correct, but I feel that lack of airflow. Whether you wanna claim it's in my head or not, it feels very real. Hate that people just disregard personal experiences.

I'm just glad I can go outside now because all winter I had to stay inside due to frigid temperatures. I wish I could work out at home, but I don't have a good spot to do so living with roommates.

One of my biggest complaints about the   Trump handling of the virus (and there are many) was his trying to force experts to not say how serious it is. It is serious, we all can see that.

However the ""listen to the science"" mantra goes a bit far in a reaction to the listen to zero science mantra of the previous administration.

The simple fact of the matter is science isn't public policy. In the eyes of these experts who are doing their job, of course they're going to say we should keep everyone locked in their homes for years on end to stop the virus...that is the science talking. The science behind the virus is a part of public policy but not the whole thing. At some point governments have to allow citizens to move around and live like they did in 2019, this isn't sustainable. 

So where did this all go wrong? Because media companies can't help but get their hands on any virus information for clicks and views. So they bring out Fauci who has words taken out of context, or outlets who aren't taking it seriously pull in scientists who may be right about something but horribly wrong about other things.

No, the vaccine has not been largely made available to the entire elderly population. There's still significant shortages in many areas, especially in minority heavy communities. That's a fact. You can check many states and see that's true. Texas for example JUST finished nursing homes not that long ago, and are still working on going through 1b, which includes everyone 65+ and people with high risk conditions. Even with vaccine production ramping up, it will still take a significant amount of time for the vaccine production to get to where it needs to be.

Two, you're telling someone to retire just because? Teachers working past 65 are likely trying to get their last years in to maximize their retirement. They've paid their dues to society; they deserve to be able to work and get their last years in, especially if they've done a good job throughout their career. 

Three, most studies have shown that long haulers are about 10% of recovered cases, many who still have issues months (like 7+ months) after they've recovered. And yes, it's unlikely with what we know of that COVID-19 can cause permanent loss of smell, but it's unlikely, not 'for sure.' Plus there's been some people who still haven't recovered their sense of smell after 6 months (5% of the case study I looked at). We still don't know the extent of what could potentially happen with some of these long haulers. So yes, people are going to want to be safe rather then sorry.

we don't. we have a handful of studies that have not yet gone through peer review, meaning we have 0 vetted studies, and some speculation based on other viruses. that's it. just because the betting odds are REALLY good that it will be highly effective against transmission, that does not mean the CDC can or should say that. not only is it still possible that the early studies are wrong, but we also know all too well what news outlets do with press releases. if the CDC says:

""early studies say it could cut transmission by 87%, but those studies are not yet peer reviewed or replicated by a significant portion of the world, so we have to wait for more data. ""

the headline on all of the news sites will be:

""CDC says vaccine eliminates transmission, ending the reasons for social distancing, early studies claim"". and readers will see ""vaccine eliminates transmission""

so in the mean time, the CDC is saying the only thing that they know for sure, which is that our current protocols still help, even if you're vaccinated, so continue doing those until we have more data. 

&gt; It’s important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to help stop this pandemic as we learn more about how COVID-19 vaccines work in real-world conditions. Experts are also looking at how many people get vaccinated and how the virus is spreading in communities. We also don’t yet know whether getting a COVID-19 vaccine will prevent you from spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to other people, even if you don’t get sick yourself. CDC will continue to update this page as we learn more.

Once the class starts though you can take your mask off to work out. If you leave your cube for any reason mask is required again.

PCR is a very versatile technique and has been used before to diagnose Viral infections such as HIV.

This study looked at the cross reactivity of many common PCR tests and none of them cross react with the common cold or flu.

Different covid tests look for different parts of the sars-cov-2 genome, but each test is specific enough to not amplify other viruses.

&gt;“In my opinion it will make no difference in terms of the efficacy of the vaccine,” said Raul Andino, a UCSF virologist who led the variant antibody research. “I would say there is nothing to be afraid of just now.”  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;In other words, the antibodies were two to four times weaker against the \[California\] variant. Similar studies looking at the variant from South Africa found antibodies to be six to 10 times weaker.  
&gt;  
&gt;The California variant should cause concern, “but certainly not like South Africa,” said Jay Levy, an infectious disease expert at UCSF who said he found the results released this week reassuring. “The vaccines will work, unless it mutates to become worse. You’re still neutralizing the virus.”  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;The key takeaway remains: Everyone should get vaccinated when their turn comes, said Bali Pulendran, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford.  
&gt;  
&gt;“If you asked me, ‘would you take the vaccine in the hope that it might offer some protection against variants?’” he said. “My answer would be a resounding yes.”

Your analogy is not apt, because you are considering *all* of the United States but you are not considering *all* countries. 

I think I have a better analogy, let's use an Olympic running race as the analogy for comparing countries.

Let's say all ~200 of the world's countries run in a race and Sweden takes 1st place, America takes 2nd, and Japan takes 3rd.

This would be like saying ""America is the second slowest medalist in the world"". Like yeah, that's true, but it's kind of a weird way to refer to literally the second fastest on the planet right?

That's how I feel when you say ""America is almost the worst first world nation"". Like yeah I guess you could phrase it that way but that seems so biased and misleading. Even being a first world nation already is a really high bar - just like being an Olympic medalist is.

I guess I just feel like people often twist words and carefully craft their sentences to be technically correct but conveying their ideas in a very biased way. 

I mean you wouldn't call the Olympic 3rd place medalist a slow runner, even though they're the slowest medalist. So why do so many people call America a shitty country on account of being the ""worst"" first world nation?

So... any of those exposure opportunities. I’m pretty good about masking. I double mask. I’m less good at washing my hands as often as I probably should (more like once every 30-60 minutes and after each individual client rather than any time I touched a surface). I ate lunch in my car. I’d take sips of water, but always from a decent distance of more than six feet. 

I’m also not really experiencing respiratory symptoms and my symptoms are annoying, but minor. I feel like I have a mild sinus infection. 

I went to dinner with a friend the night before symptom onset. I only eat outside. I wore a mask until my food arrived and then put it back when I was done eating my meal. He has since tested negative and is not experiencing any symptoms. I also live with my mother and keep distant because of my job. Her rapid test was negative and she’s waiting on her PCR results. She does not have any symptoms. 

I still think that proper best practices are an excellent mitigation strategy. I was in close contact with people who have since tested negative so let’s hope that holds up. 

I’m more annoyed because I was really close to getting vaccinated. I knew when I took this placement that it had an increased risk, but vaccines had just been approved and I was told they were already in contact with the county about a vaccine event for staff and residents. It took some time, but that was scheduled for today. I also don’t really regret it. Mental healthcare is a priority. I took precautions and it wasn’t enough. Now I have to sit out before I can be vaccinated for a few reasons. First, CDC recommendations are to wait 90 days. Idk if that’s because of an immune response or because of supply issues (I assume the latter). Second, missed the opportunity to vaccinate through my job so now I need to wait for the state to open vaccines up for my age category. It’s extremely annoying.

Not matter how good your immune system is ""primed"" to fight something, it still takes a bit of time to react (it's an organic system, after all). Maybe a few hours to a day or more.  A lot depends on how much ""viral load"" you got exposed to. 

Immune strength may vary from person to person (depending on medical history). 

Immunity may also decline over time. 

So there's a lot of variables there. To me it's one of those situations where you shouldn't assume it's not possible. You should act/behave like you're contagious,. and protect yourself (and others) accordingly.

I have been through a lot of serious medical issues myself. But ya, I guess that makes me...privileged. 

Having serious medical issues has nothing to do with any of this by the way. It was thrown in as a way to get sympathy when the issue at hand is the GYM. Most of us either have had or know people that have had serious health issues. It's not really that unique of a situation. 

I don't even know why you are bringing up a cancer survivor into this conversation. Your comments actually make no sense. You are not proving any points. You are literally just throwing around random words and phrases and its pretty funny.

You actually have no idea what you are talking about. Parents are struggling HARD right now and the fact that you are oblivious to that only reflects your low IQ and stupidity. 

Back to the point at hand: you can work out without a gym. End of story. And gyms do lead to higher spread of covid. Nobody said it was ok to not miss going to the gym, but accept the two facts:

1) You don't NEED a gym to work out 
2) Gyms are more risky and dangerous in terms of covid spread, as outlined by the CDC

All your nonsense ramblings do not take away from the facts. You call me privileged when you have 0 evidence to back that up. In fact, I'm a fellow gym goer that doesn't sit there and whine and complain like you do so that makes me a hell of a lot less privileged than you. And then you ""pity"" me just because you throw around random words. Pretty funny. Oh, and then you assume I ""stay inside"" all day. 

You are as clueless as it gets. 

To re-iterate for the HUNDREDTH time: you can work out without a gym. A gym is not a given. People have survived for hundreds of years without it.

I just did a quick average of a few family members and they come out to about 30 people per square mile for their townships. it's lower where they actually live since the residents right on the main road drive the average up. guess what, I don't have a single family member that isn't on the internet at least a few times a week. the chances that an elderly person has no internet, none of their children have internet, none of their grandchildren have internet, none of their friends have internet, and their doctor would not ask them about it is basically 0. if you're that rural and have such little contact with others that they don't know anyone with internet, then they're not rally the priority anyway.

&gt;And I'll give you that bigger companies have the capacity to do more with UI and maintaining databases, but the government should accept bids from companies if they would want to do the privatization route to give everyone a fair chance

that worked real well for the 'bama-care website /s. the reality is that few, if any, companies have the data mining and analytics capability of google, apple, and amazon. sure, you could bid it, but if you bid it intelligently, those companies would win because they've been mining data for decades on people. they will likely already know the age of peoples' grandparents and whether they prefer pepsi or coke.",,,1614234394,{},goog5ez,False,t3_lrdhm2,False,True,t1_goodkf1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lrdhm2/us_could_reach_herd_immunity_by_late_spring/goog5ez/,1614387220,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_22u0ynwv,False,False,,

— Moderna and Pfizer have committed to a total of 170 million over the next 5 weeks (85M people)

20M are fully vaccinated, with another 20 M partially. So let’s say 30M vaccinated for simple math.

That puts the US at 215M vaccination capacity by June right there. 

Willingness to get the vaccine was at 60% in the US in December. But assuming it hits 75% in the US because people see others getting it, that’s 244.5M demand.

So still a gap. 

But 5 weeks for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines only takes us to early April, and they will presumably be pumping out even more vaccines into April and May...

On top of this most states are holding vaccination sessions only for  4 days a week so average daily numbers are even lower.

The 50 mn mentioned in your article was the pre-authorization stockpile (a good chunk of it was probably exported ~36 mn doses IIRC) . There definitely is oversupply - on the bright side India is opening up vaccination to 60+ population and people aged 45+ with risk factors , and roping in the private healthcare system - scaling the session per day by 3-5X . Hopefully this increases the usage, however even at this level India won't be able to consume the daily production yet.

Growing up, my mom always cooked dinner for my family. Both of my parents worked traditional 40 hour a week jobs, so they would get home around the same time as me and my siblings and we got to spend the evenings and weekends together. My mom was a teacher, so we got vacations together as well. My siblings and I never had to worry about where our next meal came from, so if our mom made something “gross” and we didn’t want to eat it, we just didn’t eat dinner that night. 

We were extremely privileged but this isn’t the case for every family. Picture this: A single parent works multiple jobs to make ends meet. They get to spend maybe a few hours at home every night with the kids and they have to work through the weekends. Do you really think they have the energy to spend 90 minutes prepping, cooking, and cleaning up dinner? More importantly, do you think they want to waste the few hours they have with their children doing this? What happens if one of the kids throws a fit over the meal and they don’t understand this is their only meal for that day? Education, affordability, and accessibility are important but there’s one even more critical aspect: Time. So long as the lower class is forced to spend 60+ hours a week working for minimum wage, this will continue to be an issue. 

This has been studied extensively. You can educate people until the cows come home and they still fall back on unhealthy eating habits. Same goes with affordability/accessibility; you can give people all the fresh, organic produce in the world but if they don’t have the time to do anything with it, it’ll go in the trash. Jamie Oliver’s Food Revolution is an excellent example of this.

Many schools have been asking for more funding and help for almost decades at this point, and the public has generally turned a blind eye to them. Now suddenly people care about schools being open?

They also falsely asserted that schools do not drive the pandemic, nor is spread high in schools. The most recent comprehensive studies show this is not true, especially when we are looking in the UK with the UK variant (which was probably pretty much everywhere in the United States during the winter months, that or some form of it). 

Combine the two, it makes many people skeptical of the motivations of those who want schools to be open for full in person learning.

- The penalty for *accepting* AZ. Because if I take AZ, and then I cannot ""update"" to mRNA (even when they become plentiful) because ""sorry buddy, the protocol says you're already vaccinated, you cannot get two vaccines"" then for me it would be a big argument against taking AZ.

I would respect any such policy. Pushing the picky to the very end of the queue, as you say, would collectively make sense. I can't argue about it.

European leaders are now trying to restore faith. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, told the Augsburger Allgemeine in Bavaria that the vaccine was “just as safe as the products from BioNTech/Pfizer or Moderna”. Jens Spahn, the German health minister, said he would gladly be injected with the AstraZeneca vaccine.

There are signs that the message has yet to fully sink in. Reports in Belgium and parts of Germany indicate that large numbers of people offered AstraZeneca shots have failed to turn up. The French health ministry said it would launch a public campaign to overcome the vaccine’s “image deficit”. Yesterday it allowed doctors to use it on members of the public between 50 and 64 but less than half of GPs have ordered doses. The scepticism is not universal: in Italy there are few reports of no-shows.

In Germany, where 6.4 per cent of the population have received a first shot of a vaccine, frustration is building.

The rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in Europe is being hampered by bureaucratic glitches and public suspicion driven by some leaders’ scepticism.

Germany has used 15 per cent of the 1.4 million doses delivered. A poll suggested half the population would rather wait than receive what an eminent virologist called a second-class vaccine.

The backlog in Berlin is so large that the city government is contemplating administering surplus shots to homeless people. Michael Müller, the mayor, has told those who turn their noses up at the jab not to “waste their chance”.

An AstraZeneca vaccination centre in Berlin is fielding 400 appointments a day despite having a capacity for 3,800.

Supplies of vaccines to the EU have begun to pick up to the point where 75 per cent of the bloc’s adults may be inoculated by the end of August, a month ahead of schedule, according to Airfinity, a data company based in London. Yet to reach this target governments must find ways to administer stockpiles more rapidly and persuade their populations to trust the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Several EU states, including France, Germany, Poland and Italy, have declined to give the jab to older people because of the lack of early clinical trial data supporting its efficacy in over-55s. Subsequent studies from countries that have begun using the vaccine, including the UK, have shown it provides substantial protection for adults of all ages.

The scientific message has also been mangled through hostile briefing. President Macron inaccurately said the jab was “quasi-ineffective” for older adults. A German newspaper suggested officials believed the jab prevented only 8 per cent of infections in this age group.",,,1614267856,{},gops9my,True,t3_ls9fdg,False,True,t3_ls9fdg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ls9fdg/sceptical_europeans_turn_up_noses_at_astrazeneca/gops9my/,1614412116,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_136cc9,False,False,,

Two, workplaces and schools might keep their stricter stay-home policies.  And those policies might be more flexible if there are still possibilities for remote work/learning-- so you can stay home NOT because you're incapacitated, but to prevent transmission to your colleagues.  If everyone does this, it will have a counterintuitive effect.

Because there is still risk and not every kind of activity in every situation is fully encouraged.

Well unfortunately in reality there are very rarely times when we can predict the future. Doctors and scientists aren't really in a position to make absolute statements about an unprecedented global pandemic. They do their best, they hedge their statements, and ultimately a few people lose their shit because they can't accept ambiguity.

Spread elementary schoolers out among half-size classes in both elementary and MS buildings. Lunch in classrooms. Recess in a classroom-designated part of the schoolyard.

Use HS buildings for middle school classes, half-size, in cohorts that attend in-person/online hybrid, perhaps on a two-week cycle, depending on recommendations regarding incubation periods?

She said that both were honouring their supply contracts with the EU and therefore there was no limitation on their export, while on AstraZeneca’s exports the EU was keeping “a very close eye” because of the company’s shortfalls in deliveries to the 27-nation bloc.

U.S. President Joe Biden announced that the United States intends to provide an initial $2 billion, out of a total planned $4 billion, to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to support the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (Gavi COVAX AMC) to provide COVID-19 vaccines for 92 low- and middle-income countries.  

Through the U.S. Agency for International Development, this contribution will support the purchase and delivery of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for the world’s most vulnerable and at-risk populations, including frontline health care workers. This support is critical to controlling the pandemic and slowing the emergence of new variants as well as helping restart the global economy, all of which will ultimately benefit the American people.

The U.S. government will provide additional funding through 2022 and will work with other donors to make further pledges and commitments to meet the critical needs of the Gavi COVAX AMC.

I caught Corona back in March-April 2020.. ended up spending 38 days (total) in the Hospital ,. 16 of those days in ICU on a Ventilator. I lost 12lbs to muscle atrophy and couldn't even sit/stand/walk. Took me 12 days to re-learn how to walk. After hospital discharge, I was on an oxygen tank 24-7 at home for a month, .and on 2 medications (blood thinners and heart stabilizers) for 6 months. 

But I slowly got myself into fitness. I live in a very small apartment (around 380sq feet). I carved out a corner of my living room just big enough to do yoga and stretching in. I get up at 4:30am, feed the cat,. and try to pound out 30 to 45min of yoga and stretching. I also started doing small walks (sometimes just downstairs to the mailbox and back.. then to the end of the street and back. then around the block. and just kept slowly building that up longer and longer, eventually without my oxygen tank. 

That's been almost a year ago now,. and I'm currently averaging per day:

* around 7 miles walked

* around 15,000 steps

* burning an average of 1,200 Active calories per day (total of around 3,500 to 4,500 calories burned over the entire day)

* averaging around 100 min of exercise per day

&gt;The study, by the Clalit Research Institute, the research arm of Israel’s largest H.M.O. in collaboration with experts from Harvard University and Boston Children’s Hospital, found that the vaccine reduced symptomatic cases by 94 percent a week after the second dose, and reduced severe disease by 92 percent.

&gt;The study appears to be the first large-scale, peer-reviewed examination of the vaccine’s performance in general use. It included more than a million people aged 16 and over, nearly 600,000 of whom had been vaccinated, and an equally large, carefully matched control group of unvaccinated individuals.

&gt;The results reflect those of earlier studies out of Israel, as well as clinical trials showing a 95 percent efficacy rate for the vaccine.

&gt;”You’re never quite sure, after a controlled trial, will it really look like this in the real world?” Dr. Phil R. Dormitzer, vice president and chief scientific officer of viral vaccines at Pfizer, said in an interview. “So that’s some good news.”

&gt;Israel’s swift inoculation campaign has outpaced the rest of the world, making the country a kind of test laboratory for the two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. More than half the nation’s nine million people have received the first dose, and more than one-third have received both.

&gt;The country has universal health care, and about 53 percent of the population is enrolled in Clalit Health Services, giving researchers access to a huge pool of data that could be used to make certain that they were drawing sound conclusions.

&gt;”In all studies of vaccine effectiveness, a major challenge is to ensure that those we are comparing to identify the vaccine’s effect are similar in the other characteristics that may predict whether they get infected or ill,” said Prof. Marc Lipsitch of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who took part in the study. “Clalit’s extraordinary database made it possible to design a study that addressed these challenges.”

&gt;We have more than 20 years of fully digitized electronic medical records,” said Prof. Ran Balicer, who directs Clalit’s research institute and is the senior author of the new study.
The study included some 22,000 vaccine recipients aged 80 or above, a much larger sample of this exceedingly high-risk category than Pfizer had in its randomized clinical trials. The new study found no drop in effectiveness for the vaccine among older people.

&gt;”This research is a perfect example of how randomized trials and observational health care databases complement each other,” Prof. Miguel Hernán, another Harvard researcher who took part in the study, said in a statement.

&gt;The study began when Israel started its vaccination drive on Dec. 20, and continued until Feb. 1 — a period when Israel was going through its third and largest wave of infection, and when the B.1.1.7 variant, first detected in Britain, was becoming the dominant source of new cases in Israel. The study indicated that the vaccine is effective against that variant.

The countries that have gotten off to faster starts vaccinating their populations are already seeing the effects, and no bad safety signals are yet complicating things. Nor are we seeing evidence so far of antibody-dependent enhancement (worse infections recurring in people who have already been vaccinated). If we can keep this pressure up and keep ramping up vaccine supplies and their rollout around the world, we are going to beat this virus.

Connecticut has insane income inequality, which translates into health inequality. By prioritizing age, which inherently benefits wealthier people who live longer, you are leaving low income communities of color more exposed for longer. These communities have already been more impacted by covid because more of them work in essential roles and have less flexibility to work from home or easily quarantine. Now do I think a 70 year old former hedge fund guy should get the vaccine before a 25 year old grocery worker if we are trying to prevent deaths? Yes. But odds are that grocery store workers grandmother who he lives with will be less likely to get the vaccine (internet access, public outreach, vaccine hesitancy) than the hedge fund guy. So by de facto keeping vaccines out of low income communities that already have higher rates of spread and higher rates of death, we are perpetuating deaths in those communities.

So, even in our own place of employment, personal opinions on masks vary. For myself personally, I've adopted a stance of, no matter what your beliefs are, the mask is a rule that we have to follow to stay open. I like working, having a job, and making money, and I like exercising at a gym, so I'll wear my mask because I want to be able to do all these things. Heck, I even run at an incline of 12 at 7MPH during my workout and keep my mask on the whole time. Yes, it sucks, but it is what is required.

This sentiment is NOT shared by all the managers. It seems pretty evenly split. Some of the managers don't believe in the mask and won't wear it at work. Others, like myself, do, and regularly make rounds around the club to make sure members are wearing masks. Unfortunately, some of the members think they can do whatever they want because some of the other managers don't wear a mask. The managers that don't believe in wearing the mask have been reprimanded not only be the other managers, but ALSO the regional managers of the entire area. Somehow, nothing has happened. And, we other managers have mountains of evidence such as photos and videos of them not wearing a mask and testimony against them. Somehow, nothing has happened against them... which suggests to me they have at least one connection to the regional higher ups that agrees with their stance but just doesn't show it openly.

It has gotten so bad that I nearly get into a fight everyday. At least once a day I'll approach a member to wear their mask and they'll tell me to screw off and get confrontational. I remind them every time they can go find a different club to workout at if they want to shirk the rules. However, I can't be everywhere in the club at once. I know people are taking it off as soon as I turn my back. I know a lot of people won't listen because they are even other employees that won't listen. It's honestly a frustrating ordeal and I'm constantly stressed out about it every single day.",,,1614232595,{},goodnib,False,t3_lrqygk,False,False,t3_lrqygk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lrqygk/cdc_traces_covid_outbreaks_in_gyms_urging/goodnib/,1614385925,38,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_11wxuj,False,False,,

Overall, I appreciate the discussion here, but it feels on this sub in particular that most people can't appreciate nuance without saying we need to completely shut in until every single case of COVID is eliminated (slight exaggeration of course) or that we can completely ignore any and all safety measure because things are trending upwards and vaccines are now here. I'm in agreement that there is no reason to rush the re-opening, especially since there is finally good reason for optimism. 

The main point I'm trying to get across is that regardless of official guidance and mandates from the various political and public entities, each person will have a different risk tolerance for when they feel safe enough to enter into ""normal"" activities.

Robinson, PhD, MSPH, an associate professor of epidemiology at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health, told Healthline. “[COVID deniers] are cherry-picking a restrictive state that’s done worse than other restrictive states and chosen a permissive state that’s fared better than other permissive states.”

OK, let's not cherrypick, let's look at the top of the list rather than being so unfair as to pick two gigantic states that have been treated differently by the media. [The top five states in per capita COVID-19 deaths are:](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/)

1. New York

2. New Jersey

3. Rhode Island

4. Massachusetts

5. Mississippi

I wouldn't say that's terribly consistent with the narrative that ""if we all just wore masks, this would be over by now"" or that arbitrarily strict rules on things like going to gyms are effective measures for preventing COVID-19 deaths.

The pronouncements coming from people like Robinson aren't science - they have little or no interest in testable hypotheses. While granting that they have to rely to some extent on the natural experiments of different policies across locales that aren't controlling for other factors, it still seems clear that they aren't actually reacting to the results by rejecting hypotheses that are inconsistent with the facts on the ground. 

&gt;“I can’t explain why Florida is not worse off than it is. I don’t know why,” Castrucci told Healthline. “We discount that little word novel, right [in novel coronavirus]? We’re still learning a lot about this virus.”

“People who have recovered from the coronavirus or who have been vaccinated are very likely to be able to fight this variant off, there’s no doubt about that,” he said. But “they may get a little bit sick from it.”

They may also infect others and keep the virus circulating, which might delay herd immunity, he added.

But other experts were slightly more optimistic. “These things are a little bit less well controlled by vaccine, but it’s not orders of magnitude down, which would terrify me,” Dr. Read said.

As the virus continues to evolve, the vaccines will need to be tweaked, “but in the scheme of things, those aren’t huge worries compared to not having a vaccine,” Dr. Read said. “I’d say the glass is three-quarters full, compared to where we were last year.”

Why would people who want to 'defund state schools' care about schools being open?

The main people clamouring to get schools back open asap are parents groups, not people who 'have never had schools at the forefront of their mind'. Certainly here, the main political voice behind it has been the (Labour) former First Minister, an ex-secondary school teacher.  I doubt he wants to 'defund state schools', or if he does he certainly hid it very well for decades. 

They have plenty of serious academics and people involved with children's health and welfare in their corner.  

These are very real concerns that can't be (somehow, even though it makes no sense) dismissed as 'lol evil Conservatives want to dismantle the state'.

I mean, in England it's the Conservatives that have the schools still closed for another two weeks whilst here in Scotland the (nominally, really just centrish populist) left-wing SNP have had them partially open for a week already.  This is not a party political issue, it's an issue of how you balance competing needs.

Teaching unions exist to represent teachers in disputes over pay and conditions.  They are just doing their jobs by seeking to minimise the risk of teachers getting COVID.  But that's why teaching unions don't run the education system - they are just one part of the machine, focused on one thing.  The pupils' needs are not part of their remit.

The teachers I know are pretty split over the issue.  My sister (a primary school teacher) is dead set against going back until she has been vaccinated.  My MIL (secondary school) is desperate to get back asap and vehemently against schools being closed at all.

Flu is caused by an influenza virus, and while it does mutate significantly, we understand the mechanisms by which the flu propagates itself and have spent decades effectively coming up with treatments. Something like Tamiflu won't work on Coronavirus because it lacks the neuraminidase receptors require for it to inhibit and studies on the SARS-COV-2 virus have shown flu treatment to be ineffective on coronaviruse, which continues to be the case in COVID.

We will never cure literally every disease. We have genetically modified rice to fight vitamin A deficiency in impoverished nations. We added iodine to salt to combat iodine deficiency. You don't have to cure every disease that has ever and will ever exist to make an appreciable impact on the longevity of a person's life and, as a result, their viability on passing on their genes when they otherwise may have died of natural causes.

The reason why lockdown measures have had to be so strict is because the world is so full of people who think like you, i.e. 'me first' 'I've had mine so who cares', or 'I don't know anyone that has died so it can't be that bad'.  The vaccine is NOT a magic cure that stops the virus existing, it simply gives your immune system the necessary training in how to effectively deal with the virus. The virus won't just 'disappear' overnight because a large proportion of the population have got vaccinated. The hope is that this will suppress the virus to controllable levels. This virus has caused such a serious problem, primarily due to asymptomatic spread, but the shear arrogance of those in western cultures has led to this virus thriving and we have seen that it can mutate. Now is not the time to take unnecessary risks when we are so close to getting the upper hand in this frankly exhausting battle. I've been vaccinated, and I will continue to isolate, socially distance and follow the guidance because if we have to lockdown again this winter that could be the end of any functioning life for far too many of us. We are all fed of this, It's been mentally draining - anxiety and depression are everywhere, no-ones actually enjoying this. So get a grip - masks are to protect others, not you. We vaccinate everyone against lethal diseases to protect those who can't get vaccinated for real health reasons (herd immunity), so the vaccination is to protect everyone, not just you.

complex realities and makes a mess of everything.  


We have news talking about different strains emerging without making it obvious that Brazil/South Africa/California/New York all apparently are notable only because they have the same basic mutation. In that context, we have one problem to solve right now IF this mutation was to cause vaccines to be ineffective. But if you don't communicate that, we suddenly have at least FIVE (counting UK) scary variants mutating and spreading.   


Just like we can't get anywhere with a cohesive message on vaccination. 

You can be accurate and easily understood if you say ""Getting any approved vaccine gets us back to normal."" cut to kids hugging Grandma and smiling in a classroom drawing a picture of a cat with crayons. ""Hospitalizations with Moderna/Pfizer/J&amp;J: 0. Hospitalizations without: XXX,XXX""    


We have experts who are doing what they do - like Fauci - exhibiting the kind of messaging and concern we should expect a scientist to - things like you can hug grandma when you're both vaccinated probably. That kind of \* at the end of any optimism may be scientific - they don't speak in absolutes without data  -but at the same time it seems to be damaging to the population at large.  


We have a huge number of people depressed, demotivated, convinced we're in this for the foreseeable future. We don't have a science problem right now, we have a hope problem. People need a story, they need reality, and they need a roadmap. In history, can-do attitudes came from leaders and gave people a mission. Rosie the Rivieter, Uncle Sam's ""I WANT YOU!"" campaign, the WW2 rationing and ""Victory Gardens."".  Yeah, we call it propaganda - and propaganda can be extremely dangerous - but it was more than that. It was a message, it gave us a degree of cohesion, it gave the everyman and woman something to do and believe during a scary and unknown time. This is a ""keep calm and carry on"" moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Clarity will do us all a world of good, and that clarity doesn't have to be dishonest, it doesn't have to be gruesome, and we don't need to hedge our bets to the degree we are (Well, we don't KNOW vaccines slow the spread is safely BS at this point from a public messaging perspective.) 

&amp;#x200B;

There is so much good news right now - so very, very, very much amazingly good news right now after a year of Hell for the planet and frankly it shocks and depresses me how few people in my life are aware of ANY of it.

Better sick leave policies at work and school absence policies in schools as well as a general shift towards people understanding that they should stay home when they’re sick to keep other safe could help. Masks could be required during flu season in airports and settings where people are in contact with very vulnerable people, such as for visitors to hospitals and nursing homes. Flu testing could also get more common and routine for people who have jobs that put them in frequently contact with the elderly.

Before now our approach to fighting flu in the US was just constantly asking people to wash their hands and I’m skeptical that it ever had any significant effect. Telling people to do something doesn’t guarantee they’ll do it and even if you do get people to wash their hands several times a day that doesn’t mean they won’t touch their face in between.
