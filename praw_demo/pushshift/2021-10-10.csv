If you want to define the border restrictions as Taiwan's lockdown, fine. Though, it would probably be ideal to clarify what you mean initially. I'm not sure that many people would necessarily define lockdown in that way. 

Taiwan is extremely isolated geopolitically: to the point that having diplomatic representation in Somaliland was a major victory. Taiwan also works hard to maintain international recognition by its few allies in the Pacific and Carribean through student exchanges, development projects, etc. The Taiwanese government is likely trying to take advantage of other countries' largess to promote itself on the world stage. They know that it's a smart move to show themselves in a good light to make any potential PRC invasion look cruel and unreasonable. That was also partly the goal of the ""Taiwan can Help"" campaign of donating masks and PPE to diplomatic allies and other nations.

Yes, you're right that it would be better to donate vaccines to poorer countries because their need is clearly greater. We're probably running into geopolitics again. Some vaccine donations have been a show of support for Taiwan and trying to ward off a potential Chinese invasion, like the USA's. Some of them have reciprocal, like Poland and Lithuania's. Japan's donations were a mix of both, and because of Japan's affection for Taiwan. Taiwan was a colony of Japan. 

Further, Taiwan is crucial in creating computer chips. The United States and other nations were already struggling with getting enough chips for their electronics before. It would be significantly more difficult for the world supply chain if the outbreak in Taiwan had escalated to the point where a hard lockdown was enforced. Other nations know that donating vaccines to Taiwan will also prevent further stresses on the global supply chain.

Last, Medigen was going to produce only 5 million doses of their 2 shot vaccine in 2021, for a population of 23.4 million. The supply will likely be ramped up in 2022 so Taiwan can completely vaccinate its own population. That's why the Taiwanese government also bought vaccines from Moderna, COVAX, and eventually got Pfizer-BNT vaccines too. They knew that there would be a bottleneck of Medigen's vaccine before it was authorized for wider use. The government also started purchasing other vaccines when the Medigen vaccine was still in trial phases. It was uncertain whether the vaccine would be successful. There were several promising candidates for locally produced vaccines. Only Medigen's was found to be safe and produce a strong immune response.",,,,1633908827,,{},hg5z4rn,False,t3_q4v23f,False,True,t1_hg4cp99,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q4v23f/2nd_covid19_vaccine_donation_from_lithuania/hg5z4rn/,1634033169.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Covid has a long period of asymptomatic spread, followed by a few weeks of illness which leaves most people still able to function semi normally. It has nothing to gain from becoming more mild and everything to gain from ramping up more quickly to spread, which is why the Delta variant has something like 1200x higher viral load during the phase where covid spreads.

It's not of concern and has reportedly been completely displaced by Delta.

&gt;Sputnik Lights

Sputnik Light is rather trustworthy -- it's nothing but the first dose of Sputnik. The protection against symptomatic infection is marginal, but apparently, it can keep you out of the ICU.

&gt;Not sure if Russia reports all known cases either.

That, and many cases remain unknown. It's next to impossible to get tested in many regions, and the false-negative rate is high.

&gt;Still way off when comparing covid deaths vs excess deaths

On the one hand, our healthcare has ground to a halt in 2020, and I'm fairly certain that people with non-covid medical emergencies are mostly left to die. On the other, the death rate has been abnormally steady around 800 deaths/day throughout the first Delta surge in June-July 2021, and this makes the rest of the curve highly suspicious too.

&gt;Either way, Russia is now on record level of daily deaths, and it is only October.

I'm saying that the disease spreads very quickly along social networks -- people who know and congregate with each other, particularly in close quarters and indoors.  If there are two similar groups that don't really interact with each other, one group may be hit very badly while the other doesn't register any cases.  Social networks may get infected quickly -- an extreme case would be a prison population, where, in the US, we saw entire prisons infected in the space of a week or two -- and then register a rapid drop in cases because everyone in that group who could be infected had been infected.  Note also that during the pandemic, links between social groups may be cut off (so infections are more confined to unlucky groups) because people start isolating themselves.

I would like to highlight and fill a couple gaps in the above tweet:

1: he said stop *BUYING* masks(likely referencing the highly effective N95 or KN95 masks) because he wants to prevent a shortage for medical workers.

2: The next part is slightly confusing but I‚Äôll try to clear the air a bit.

To be fair, human beings are not viruses. We have much more sophisticated repair mechanisms. For reference, you experience an estimated 10,000 mutations PER CELL per day. So the fact that it is mutagenic does not necessarily mean people should be sorely afraid of it. 

I'll note too that other riboside drugs have had troubled development histories; there are often problems with them.

Not certainly, but quite likely. 

What's *not* clear at all is whether this very probable activity is actually severe enough to be of concern. I would guess that there is good chance it's bad for fetuses, if only because other ribosides have caused severe birth defects. But when it comes to adults...what you can show in a test tube and what happens in the complex human environment can be very different. 

So, is it grill marks on a hamburger carcinogenic (not a problem unless you eat nothing but that)? Or more like say, benzene, where even brief exposure to enough of it is a concern?
The trouble, honestly, is that we really don't have a good ability to identify, say, ""moderate"" damage of this sort. We're generally good at sussing out severe carcinogens, and we can tell whether something is at least a bit mutagenic, but milder stuff isn't generally caught until a lot of time has passed, and statistical trends show up over a few decades.

It is complicated but an employer can structure there plan in order to offer a wellness incentive which would include vaccination status. The ""incentive"" can include premium surcharge but I am more familiar with plans that offer carrots such as free membership in a gym or weight loss program. Plans commonly might have ""incentives"" for non-smoking and the surcharge for smoking can be 50% of the premium.

[https://www.wnj.com/Publications/Can-an-Employer-Charge-Unvaccinated-Employees-a-Hi](https://www.wnj.com/Publications/Can-an-Employer-Charge-Unvaccinated-Employees-a-Hi)

A participant must be given the opportunity each year to qualify for the reward (i.e., avoid the surcharge).  
The maximum reward for all health-contingent wellness programs (including the vaccine incentive) cannot be more than 30% of the total cost of the employee‚Äôs health coverage (both employee and employer contributions), though incentives tied to smoking can go up to 50% of the cost.  
The program must be reasonably designed to improve health or prevent disease.  
The program must meet uniform availability and reasonable alternative standards. A COVID-19 vaccination incentive program must include both of the following features:  
The program must provide a reasonable alternative activity (or waiver of the activity) for any individual for whom it is unreasonably difficult due to a medical condition or medically inadvisable to perform the activity (which can be verified with the individual‚Äôs personal physician, when it is reasonable to do so). Coming up with an alternative may not be easy, so a waiver may be the most practical solution.  
The full reward must be available to someone who completes the program or satisfies the reasonable alternative standard (or waiver of the standard). Depending on how the program is structured, if an employee who is paying the surcharge becomes vaccinated, the employee may be entitled to a refund (or credit) of the surcharges the employee has paid up to that point in the plan year.",,,,1633961409,,{},hg8aizu,False,t3_q3mg36,False,True,t1_hg7us2a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q3mg36/fired_for_refusing_a_covid_vaccine_you_likely/hg8aizu/,1634079075.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes, but the transmission rates are so low that if nearly everyone is vaccinated there is practically zero chance that my grandmother will catch it from someone.

Measles is several times more contagious than COVID; an infected person will spread measles to 9 out of 10 unprotected people that they encounter.

There's also a large disparity in recovery, some people get ""long Covid"" symptoms but many seem to recover completely.

It's possible that Covid can cause life-long latent infection, but it's also possible that it doesn't.

Definitely agree, but it's worth mentioning that *not* all long covid is created equal.  Right now it's defined  as one or more symptoms persisting after X amount of time (couple months, if I recall correctly).  So from that figure (19%) someone having a lingering cough would technically be in the same category as another person with neurological symptoms being effectively disabled, even if very few / none of the latter were vaccinated.  Similar thing to hospitalization stats with 'breakthrough' cases; an overnight stay out of precaution qualifies as a 'hospitalization' counts the same as somebody on a ventilator / in the ICU. At least there, we know for sure far less vaccinated people are ending up in rough shape even within the 'hospitalized' cohort than with unvaxxed.

&gt;The research published on Monday also found that vaccines appear to protect against the worst effects of the most prevalent virus strain, the Delta variant.

&gt;‚ÄúThis means that those who are vaccinated are nine times less at risk of being hospitalised or dying from Covid-19 than those who have not been vaccinated,‚Äù the epidemiologist Mahmoud Zureik, who oversaw the research, told Agence France-Presse.

&gt;The study ‚Äì the largest of its kind so far ‚Äì was carried out by Epi-Phare a scientific group set up by France‚Äôs health system, its national health insurance fund, l‚ÄôAssurance Maladie (CNAM), and the country‚Äôs ANSM medicines agency.

&gt;Researchers compared 11.3 million vaccinated over-50s with the same number of unvaccinated from the same age group between 27 December 2020, when vaccinations began in France, and 20 July this year.

&gt;They found ‚Äúa reduction in the risk of hospitalisation superior to 90%‚Äù from the 14th day after the second dose and a similar reduction in the number of deaths from Covid-19. Similar findings have previously been published in Israel, the UK and the US.

&gt;The vaccines‚Äô effectiveness in combatting the most serious symptoms of Covid did not diminish during the five-month period of the study, they said. The results were the same no matter whether the patient was given the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna or Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.

&gt;The Janssen one-dose shot, authorised later in France, was not included as the researchers felt there had not been enough patients or time to properly study its effectiveness.

&gt;Researchers only had a month between the emergence of the Delta variant in France and the end of the study, but results showed the vaccines reduced the risk of serious symptoms and death by 84% among the over-75s and 92% for the 50-74 age group.

&gt;‚ÄúThis is a very short period to evaluate the real impact of the vaccination on this variant,‚Äù Zureik said, adding that research was continuing into the effect of vaccines on the Delta variant.

&gt;To ensure the closest possible comparison, researchers paired vaccinated and unvaccinated people of the same age and sex living in the same region. The study looked only at the most serious symptoms of infection and did not examine if the vaccines stopped people becoming infected or transmitting the virus.

&gt;Zureik said avoiding the most serious infections was ‚Äúthe main public health objective‚Äù. ‚ÄúAn epidemic without serious infections is no longer an epidemic,‚Äù he added.

&gt;The report concludes: ‚ÄúAll the vaccines [studied] against Covid-19 are highly effective and have a major effect on the reductions of serious forms of Covid-19 among people aged 50 years and older living at the current time in France. The continuing research by Epi-Phare will allow us to measure the evolution of this effectiveness over a longer period and better establish the effects on the Delta variant.‚Äù",,,,1633978839,,{},hg9fv67,True,t3_q62yxd,False,False,t3_q62yxd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q62yxd/french_study_of_over_22m_people_finds_vaccines/hg9fv67/,1634101080.0,36,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the last 18 months, COVID has caused problems because most of the population has never had it before.  The first time you catch COVID, you have dramatically worse outcomes and are far more contagious, because your immune system doesn't know WTF to do.

As enough people become exposed for the first time, either through vaccination or infection, this will change.  Reinfections and breakthroughs are much less contagious and have somewhat less severe outcomes.

At some point the societal threat of imminent hospital collapse if we ignored the pandemic will end.  At that point the pandemic will be over, and (in most countries) COVID will simply be declared endemic.  An endemic disease circulates regularly in the population, causing a low but expensive public health burden.  The best examples are flu (we have a flu season in the US with tens of thousands of deaths each winter, but it's far from the public health burden of COVID over the last 18 months), or measles (which killed 1-5,000 children a year until we started vaccinating for it).

In the medium term (*next* winter) we'll get some idea of what a long-term endemic Delta will do. In the worst case scenario, Delta could increase the annual respiratory-disease burden several-fold.  In a medium-case scenario it could be less severe in its reinfections than the flu.  In a best-case scenario it'll go the way of measles, with vaccinations preventing any measurable level of spread.  We basically have no idea which of these scenarios is most likely.",,,,1633977456,,{},hg9cldx,False,t3_q5q9bn,False,False,t1_hg7esqi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q5q9bn/daily_discussion_thread_october_11_2021/hg9cldx/,1634099428.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This all aside, NZ is far from a ""cautionary tale"". They have 6 deaths per 1M, compared to (for example) 1,460 deaths per 1M in Sweden. NZ successfully contained every wave of infection until now, while their population is very far along in vaccinations.

[],,blackandgay676,,,[],,,,text,t2_4fgagi6r,False,False,,"&gt;So that does make sense but I was under the impression that the danger from Covid was still running strong, even with the currently available vaccines

You're right that it's still a concern that overall but less so with vaccination (protection against death with the vaccines is still in the 90 percent range I think). The most important thing to remember with funding in the US atleast is that we as a country will do the absolute minimum amount possible as a society to mitigate any threat unless we can throw a literal bomb at it. The vaccines we have work well enough so why should we pay for more vaccines to be fast tracked? 

To be clear I do think we should find this and I agree it should be fast tracked in the same way however my day job is public health STD prevention and we got pretty shafted last year so I'm not holding my breath.

&gt; Oregon saw a huge spike in vaccinated Covid deaths in august, 23% if I remember correctly. I thought that is because Covid is doing what the ops story was meant to fight, mutating enough to lower the effectiveness of the current vaccines

I looked it up cuz that percentage is really high from what I expected. I was a bit shocked that over the entire pandemic Oregon only has ~6k deaths so far. Given that I feel like it's not a super big concern from the perspective of the powers that be.

&gt; It seems like most states are buckling down harder with restrictions to try to fight it. That doesn‚Äôt make sense if we can see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Are they? I feel like the only states that did much of anything in terms of harder lockdowns is New York City. Granted I also only go from home to work to school so I've been a bit out of the loop and extremely tired. Atleast for me nothing has really changed since atleast May when restrictions were lifted in most states.

&gt; DR. FAUCI: Well, you know, one of the things we want to make sure is that we have had over the last few weeks a turning around of the acceleration of this, starting to come down in cases and hospitalizations and soon deaths. The one thing that we don't want to do is that we don't want to become complacent and say, ""OK, now we need to pull back, we don't need any more people to get vaccinated."" We need to continue to get those individuals, now 70 million people who are eligible to be vaccinated, vaccinated. Because if you look at the history, MARGARET, of the different surges we've had, it's come up, start to come down and then all of a sudden boom, come back up again. As it's coming down, we have within our capability, we can make this happen. Namely go down to a very, very low level, with vaccination and with mitigation. 

&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN: Well--

&gt; DR. FAUCI: So that's the one thing I want to make sure that our viewers realize that we've done well in the sense of getting 55% of the population fully vaccinated and 64% with at least one dose. But we've got to keep pushing on the vaccination front.

&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. You said, ""Don't let your guard down."" There are two new studies out that show COVID's gotten better at transmitting through aerosols, just through the air. What does that mean? We're going into cold weather. We're going into the holidays. Do people need to start looking around and saying it's just too risky to gather with family members if there are unvaccinated children?

&gt; DR. FAUCI: Well, MARGARET, I believe just the way the CDC has recommended that when you are in a situation where you have a dynamic of virus in the community, where there's clearly a lot of spread, even if you are vaccinated and you are in an indoor setting, a congregate setting, it just makes sense to wear a mask and to avoid high risk situations. And what we should be doing is look at ventilation in indoor places. We know now that this is clearly spread by aerosol, and when you have something spread by aerosol, you absolutely want more ventilation, which is the reason why outdoors is always much safer than indoors. And if you are indoors, ventilation is going to be key. And that's the reason why we really should be paying attention to that.

&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN: But we can gather for Christmas, or it's just too soon to tell.

&gt; DR. FAUCI: You know, MARGARET, it's just too soon to tell. We've just got to concentrating on continuing to get those numbers down and not try to jump ahead by weeks or months and say what we're going to do at a particular time. Let's focus like a laser on continuing to get those- those cases down. And we can do it by people getting vaccinated and also in the situation where boosters are appropriate to get people boosted because we know that they can help greatly in diminishing infection and diminishing advanced disease, the kinds of data that are now accumulating in real time.

Background: US population-based data on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the 3 currently FDA- authorized products is limited. Whether declines in VE are due to waning immunity, the Delta variant, or other causes, is debated.

 Methods: We conducted a prospective study of 8,834,604 New York adults, comparing vaccine cohorts defined by product, age, and month of full-vaccination to age-specific unvaccinated cohorts, by linking statewide testing, hospital, and vaccine registry databases. VE was estimated from May 1, 2021 for incident laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (weekly life-table hazard rates through September 3) and hospitalizations (monthly incidence rates through August 31). 

Results: 155,092 COVID-19 cases and 14,862 hospitalizations occurred. Estimated VE for cases declined contemporaneously across age, products, and time-cohorts, from high levels beginning May 1 (1.8% Delta variant prevalence), to a nadir around July 10 (85.3% Delta), with limited changes thereafter (&gt;95% Delta). Decreases were greatest for Pfizer-BioNTech (-24.6%, -19.1%, -14.1% for 18-49, 50-64 years, and ‚â•65 years, respectively), and similar for Moderna (-18.0%, -11.6%, -9.0%, respectively) and Janssen (-19.2%, -10.8, -10.9%, respectively). VE for hospitalization for adults 18-64 years was &gt;86% across cohorts, without time trend. Among persons ‚â•65 years, VE declined from May to August for Pfizer-BioNTech (95.0% to 89.2%) and Moderna (97.2% to 94.1%). VE was lower for Janssen, without trend, ranging 85.5%-82.8%.

 Conclusions: Declines in VE for cases may have been primarily driven by factors other than waning. VE for hospitalizations remained high, with modest declines limited to Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna recipients ‚â•65 years, supporting targeted booster dosing recommendations.",,,,1633931140,,{},hg750qk,True,t3_q5p85j,False,True,t3_q5p85j,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q5p85j/covid19_vaccine_effectiveness_by_product_and/hg750qk/,1634055837.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

So this is true not only for long hauler covid but a number of other things.  Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, while pretty much instantly curable with a short dose of antibiotic.....yet lingering symptoms may persist simply because of the damage it did DURING the acute phase.

What you said above that I quoted is so true of many disorders.   Fibromyalgia for instance.   


The problem is that things that don't have ""treatments"" or are not ""fixable"" cause a lot of angst and mistrust in the doctor/patient relationship.

A year and a half ago, we knew nothing about this virus. It quickly overwhelmed our healthcare system. We had to stop the spread at all costs and most of the country rose to the challenge and went in to quarantine. 

The selfish idiots who refused to do so paid the price with their own lives or the lives of their friends and family. 

Fast forward today, the facts are very different. We know this virus. We know how it works, how it spreads, who is most vulnerable to it. We have safe and effective vaccines, we have promising therapeutics.  

Instead of hating and trying to control each other, why don‚Äôt we come together and fight this thing? 

Poverty and wealth inequality are at historic levels. Give vaccinated people $1000 stimulus checks. 

Our ICUs continue to have capacity issues‚Ä¶ BUILD MORE. China built hundreds of hospitals in 3 months. Impoverished blue collar areas are being hit hardest, put those folks to work building infrastructure to fight back. This could create millions of decent jobs. 

We have medical staffing issues. We also have a lot of people with college degrees who can‚Äôt find work and are buried in debt. Send them to nursing school for free, forgive their debt, give reoccurring bonuses to healthcare workers who are on the front lines fighting this thing. Pay people to relocate if needed. Take care of our heroes instead of just patting them on the back. 

Some therapeutics have shown promise. Invest in research to find out if they actually work. Invest in figuring out ways to make things like monoclonal antibody treatment more accessible. This may be better than investing more money in predictive research, as there‚Äôs mounting circumstantial evidence that that type of research may have gotten us into this mess in the first place.

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Officials on Monday registered 957 new deaths from Covid-19 over 24 hours, bringing the country's total fatalities to 217,372 ‚Äì the highest toll in Europe ‚Äì even as **authorities are accused of downplaying the severity of Russia's outbreak.**  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The growing toll from the virus comes as Russia's jab drive has stalled. As of Monday, just over 30 percent of Russians had been fully vaccinated, according to the Gogov website, which tallies Covid-19 data from the regions.""Yes, indeed, the level of vaccinations we have is small, unacceptably small,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, saying that this is the reason for ""such a high mortality rate.""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;But **he dismissed the notion that authorities could do more, saying they had done everything to give the public the chance to ""save their lives by getting vaccinated.""**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;While several Russian-developed jabs have been available for months, authorities have struggled to inoculate a vaccine-skeptic population.Independent polls show that more than **half of Russians do not plan to get a shot.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The **surging infections have come without any real pandemic restrictions to limit the spread**, though several regions have re-introduced QR codes for access to public places.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Capital Moscow has so far withheld from bringing back restrictions, but on Monday announced that it would open two dozen sites around the city where residents could get free express tests.Officials said the additional sites would allow authorities to ""completely avoid the introduction of severe restrictions"" and **""not harm the city's economy.""**

So they simply gave up. Put all the responsibility on regions. Some QR-restrictions, which they had this summer with no real effect on daily Covid deaths.

Unfortunately new cases and daily deaths will increase all autumn, as they let Covid run through their population.

We don't have any consensus on how quickly efficacy against infection wanes.  Only a small fraction of people are 6+ months since their most recent dose, and we're not likely to get much data beyond that point out of wealthy countries since they'll be giving third doses.  About the best we can do is approximate by comparing the geometric decay from [this old paper](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2103916) to the graph from [this one](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01377-8).

Ignoring any waning efficiency, though, every study on third doses has been incredibly positive.  Moderna's [n=20 phase 1](https://investors.modernatx.com/static-files/c43de312-8273-4394-9a58-a7fc7d5ed098) showed them raising antibody titers 42-fold, bringing them 6 times higher than after the second dose.   [This](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.29.21264089v1) larger study showed closer to 2 times higher after the third dose vs the second.  Both of these results should bring efficacy against infection back into the 95% range we had against wildtype.

[Real-world data from Israel](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.07.21264626v1) basically confirms this, showing at least a 5-fold (and likely more like 10-fold) reduction in infections after a third dose. Even more significantly, Delta cases have been cut nearly in half weekly since they gave another 0.5 doses per population over the last months.  It's the exact same effect we saw against Alpha once we crossed 50% with a first dose back in spring.

With something like 10 million people in the US having had a third dose, we'll get some kind of real-world data from the states soon.  But like the initial EUA, this is going to be data rolling in with lots of confounding factors as we continue to give out doses.",,,,1633976598,,{},hg9ajcw,False,t3_q5q9bn,False,True,t1_hg7zibk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q5q9bn/daily_discussion_thread_october_11_2021/hg9ajcw/,1634098327.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,ConfusedByPans,,,[],,,,text,t2_4ssq9,False,False,[],"Your family isn't totally misinformed, but they're being alarmist and definitely giving into fearmongering. It sounds like you're US-based, so also keep in mind they may be confusing news from the UK, which is about to be (or is?) being hit hard by Brexit-related shortages. It's global but the shortages in the UK have that additional compounding factor.

The simple answer is that supply chain issues are causing a ripple effect in the food industry. I've been having trouble finding bottled Gatorade since July, and I believe PepsiCo has cited as the shortages in plastic bottles being a part of the issue. Labor shortages are potentially causes issues in the meat industry, and another commenter mentioned expected shortages of cereal due to the strike at Kelloggs. But that doesn't affect just Kelloggs products. If Kelloggs products are in short supply, consumers will shift to other brands, and those products will in turn be in short supply (since they can't ramp up production immediately). Brands will also sometimes concentrate on their best selling items and stop producing less popular items (for example, Coke could focus on producing Coke, Diet Coke, and Dr. Pepper but put a hold on, say, Fanta briefly) thus furthering the perception that there are shortages, even if the shortage is by design.

In short, the more ""ingredients"" a product requires, including human labor and packaging, the more places the supply chain can fail. A great example is the current shortage for Lunchables. Think about how much goes into one Lunchable: the meat, the dairy, the grains, some have drinks, some have branded candies like Reese's, they require more than one type of packaging (the plastic film, the plastic tray, and the cardboard exterior), the human labor involved, etc. I've read that demand increased for Lunchables due to overworked and over-stressed parents, so of course they're disappearing from the shelves.

And *then*, on top of all of that, commodity and transportation costs are rising. 

All in all, it's incredibly complex and there are many, many causes, and it varies by locality and industry.

You're asking for a source for known medical issues like hypoxia? Yeah... google.com.  Seriously?

&gt; You‚Äôve changed your claim from ‚Äúalmost all‚Äù to ‚Äúa large portion‚Äù, which is an improvement. But the reason long Covid is so mysterious right now is because many people are suffering without any noticeable cause. There are patients with no visible damage to organs who hold onto symptoms for months. As far as I can glean, we still have no clue why.

That's the entire point I'm making.  Lots of people are making the assertion that 'long covid' is a new medical condition.  The point I'm making is that there are already existing medical conditions here caused by covid.

If you go mountain climbing and have long term hypoxia we don't call it ""long mountain climbing"" ... if you deprive the brain of oxygen for long periods of time you're going to have brain damage.

This is already well established.

&gt; If you can find any studies that include non-hospitalized participants, I‚Äôm itching to read them. So far, we really just have data from the severe cases and none from the mild/asymptomatic ones.

I think one of the things that is concerning me now is that many of the 'mild' cases, had they been hospitalize, would have been given oxygen due to hypoxia and not *realizing* they've had hypoxia.  

That's pretty frightening and might be the cause of many of these 'long covid' cases.

The point I'm trying to make is that we already know the mechanism of action of some of the damage caused by covid and we don't really need a new classification here.",,,,1633974209,,{},hg94ub3,False,t3_q5j8tz,False,True,t1_hg91l62,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q5j8tz/doctors_warn_of_possible_rise_of_debilitating/hg94ub3/,1634095329.0,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The testing is aso not accurate due to false positives and negatives, but it is better than nothing. 

The vast majority of people spreading this do not have any symptoms at all and usually don't get a test. 

1 percent of the folks die. 

So if you are spreading to others with no symptoms and this chain continues then you give it to someone who does get sick is like the old six degrees of separation. 

The delta variant is worse than last year too. Hear immunity for alpha was 60 percent. With social distancing and masks it was like 20-30. With delta, is is like 80-95, which why we are now seeing the new tactics such as employers over 100, the only reason it over 100 is politics (this guy hates small business). 

So, if you are not social distancing, you could be killing all sorts of folks, because a death rate of 1 percent is high. At the vary least, it is contributing. Worse case, is you are keeping the positivity rate high, which is why we are still dealing with this thing. 

So, there is no way of knowing if you directly killed someone through a chain. Just like an STD, but with your breath. 

You shouldn't be to hard on yourself regarding the positivity rate though. Between wells in human areas and animal populations, that is a lost cause. The vaccines are the only way to fix this. Kids can't get the vaccines yet though, so children and the people that interact with them are at risk. 

Fauci is wrong on this and it isn't the first time. Kids should be able to get it by Jan next year. After that, the only folks left are antivax and people that can't get one due to medical reasons. The medical people will not be out of the woods until the virus runs it's course due to antivax folks. The course being natural immunity and vaccinated. 

The game changed with delta, so even the vaccinated can spread it and even get it. 

The next reprieve after children getting it will be delta specific vaccines and better treatments. We are already seeing good things happening with hospital band death due to that. 

So candy and dress up is not worth any of that, and Fauci is being just as irresponsible as he was when he said we can open back up after the vaccine for adults, and when he/CDC said that masks don't work. 

What sucks is we won't be ready for Thanksgiving or Christmas either because of kids not being able to get it until November, which means Jan will be when we can really start going back to normal.

POTS is likely an autoimmune disorder, often appearing after a viral infection (not just Covid) and possibly the vaccine helps fix the immune response in some way.

&gt;How is the vaccine helping some long-haulers?  
&gt;As many as 30 to 40% of those who get the vaccine have reported improvements to their symptoms. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard from people who say they no longer have ‚Äòbrain fog,‚Äô their gastrointestinal problems have gone away, or they stopped suffering from the shortness of breath they‚Äôve been living with since being diagnosed with COVID-19,‚Äù says Iwasaki.

&gt;Why might they feel better after the vaccine?  
&gt;It‚Äôs possible that the vaccine is helping the immune system fight off residual virus lingering in their bodies and clearing these remnants away, says Iwasaki. Or the vaccine could be stopping a harmful immune response. Or it might serve to reset the immune system. At this point, researchers can only hypothesize. There is a lot to learn about how the vaccine works in long-haulers, which is why Iwasaki and her collaborators are pursuing this research.

People that think its a matter of either life or death are idiots.  They don't think about life long effects.  They can't see more than 24 hours ahead into life.  

Chicken pox enters your central nervous system and hides there for decades, only to show up later as the shingles. 

Any virus that can enter the central nervous system has the potential to lay dormant there, only replicating a little.  Your body doesn't have a way of eliminating the virus once it's in there.  And it has the potential to come at you later in life in some fucked up way.

Covid19 does this, it enters your central nervous system.  This is why many people get brain brain or lose their sense of taste and smell.  The only way those are possible is if it attacks your central nervous system.

So yes, when people said this could be like airborne aids, and were mocked for it, they weren't truly wrong, because it absolutely has the potential to be with you for life.  There is no method for testing for covid if it's hiding in your CNS.  You can test negative all day with the current tests, they are simple and only check if you have it in your nose/throat etc

Like herpes, you can't really test for the virus unless you have symptoms (for herpes you need to have open sores).  

To me this is why the governments of the world reacted so intensely with lockdowns etc, some people think it's an over reaction but it very well could be an under reaction.
