In the United States, we have an abundance of COVID vaccines; we watch helplessly as anti-vaxxers turn up their noses at preventative medicine, and die horrible, torturous deaths.


Meanwhile, many countries are being left behind and unable to vaccinate their populations. Only 20% of people in low-income countries have received a first dose of vaccine compared to 80% in high- and upper-middle income countries.


With such low vaccination rates in lower income countries, strict behavioral measures have to remain for the foreseeable future, and they potentially become breeding grounds for new variants.


The global picture of access to COVID-19 vaccines is unacceptable, let's make a difference.

Now I'm vaccinated, and also got a booster last week.

I believe I had a breakthrough a few months back. It was some sinus pain (crazy intense pain, something was definitely trying to infect me) and post nasal drip for all of a day and a half. Then it went away. By the time I was able to get tested, I was negative.

So if I actually had Delta infecting me, the vaccine worked brilliantly. It also means I've had 5 exposures - my initial infection, 3 vaccine doses and the ""breakthrough*. If it wasn't Delta, then I've still had 4 exposures with the vaccine doses.

Do you remember the Bush era and talking points and all that? They (the White House, their friends, their press outlets) literally got a new page of talking points in 18pt bold every day. Some days there was carry over from the previous day, but there were new talking points every day. Everyone stuck to the same words, the same verbiage. (Jon Stewart was able to make great use of this on The Daily Show.) And it worked. That's what the average American needs to get them to, you know, support illegal wars, spread deadly viruses, stuff of that magnitude.

The democrats need to stop talking to the democratic voters and start shouting at the republican voter base. (They seem to like shouting.) They need to communicate to hardcore republicans. The way to do that is to repeat the same 5th grade nonsense, loudly and authoritatively, in ways that invite controversy, while stirring up feelings of pride, shame, hate, and fear. I'm sorry, but it's true. It would be nice if the progressives and the democrats could figure that out.

Effective communication, to me, would be Fauci walking away from a press conference coughing and vomiting then falling down and deliriously shouting ""The virus! The virus will kill us all!"" While he's being dragged away he'd be tweeting his homies Kid Rock and Kanye West to write a song to get the message out. Save America from the virus! Save the world! Then in a couple of days he could cryptically tweet out a few things like ""Urgent: lab must be destroyed!"" with some odd numeric clues for the conspiracy theory wing. Then the CIA could just bombs one of the islands they own and suddenly everyone is okay with wearing masks and taking vaccines.

Look. There are things bigger than Trump. The internet is bigger than Trump. Zuckerberg is bigger than Trump. Putin is way bigger than Trump. COVID is bigger so much than Trump. Climate change is so much bigger than all of us. We have to stop treating any authoritarian moron as the final say on anything. There's too much at stake. We have to go big. We have to go bold.

I witnessed the same behaviour with tagesschau for example. DW writes:

&gt; This time around, though, it's the number of hospitalizations that count. [...] In Germany, the number of coronavirus patients being admitted to hospitals in the past seven days remains low. Germany's Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for disease control puts the number of patients admitted to hospitals in the past seven days at 2.68.

Lets see what RKI actually writes [here](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/Wochenbericht/Wochenbericht_2021-10-21.pdf?__blob=publicationFile) page 14 graphic 12 (greenish curve) and they write:

&gt; There is a time delay between the start of hospitalization for a COVID-19 case and the time at which this information is received by the RKI. In order to better evaluate the trend in the number of hospitalizations and the 7-day hospitalization incidence, we supplement the reported hospitalization incidence with an estimate of the expected number of delayed reported hospitalizations [...] The dark gray line and the green estimation area represent the estimated Course, which also contains the hospitalizations that are still to be expected. **It can be seen that the downward trend had turned into a plateau since mid-September. Since the 7th
of October we observed a new increase in the adjusted hospitalization incidence.**

The current way of data collection about hospitalisation rate is slow and unsuitable as risk indicator. ICU admission might be better. Furthermore the government has decided that only newest daily hospitalisation data is used to determine necessity of intervention. **It completely ignores how volatile and bad this data is. Many new agencies report this flawed data without comment, despite them knowing this fact, which is frustrating.**

&gt; [Translated from german] Why the hospitalization incidence is useless

&gt; Brake does not apply until late
&gt; A brake coupled to the incidence of hospitalization (H incidence) is therefore applied relatively late and could probably no longer hold up the ongoing dynamic of infection. But there is a bigger problem: In its current form, the value is practically unusable. [...] The decisive shortcoming: The curve displayed is massively misleading because it points downwards. At first glance, it seems that the trend is positive and the number of serious Covid cases is decreasing.

&gt; But that is not the case. Rather, the RKI's calculation method means that the more up-to-date it is, the more imprecise and lower the value is. Because the date on which a corona patient came to the hospital is not decisive for the assignment in the statistics. It is the day on which his positive corona test was reported. For the most recent date, it is of course not yet known how many infected people will have to go to hospital at some point. [And this is the value government uses smh]

&gt; There is an average of four days between reporting a new case and being admitted to the hospital. The RKI also calculates incidences for reporting days on which these cases cannot yet be in hospital. Data experts at ""Zeit"" and ""Spiegel"" have calculated: The current H incidence value is 70 to 80 percent lower than it should actually be. [...]

&gt; The bottom line is that there is a lot to be said for looking at the number of Covid 19 patients in intensive care units - and ignoring the incidence of hospitalization. This measured variable also depends on the number of infections, because it often takes weeks before an infected person may have to be treated in the intensive care unit. But the registration numbers are updated daily by the intensive care units and do not suffer from the bias caused by the statistics according to the registration date. https://www.hessenschau.de/gesellschaft/neue-corona-grenzwerte-fuer-hessen-weshalb-die-hospitalisierungsinzidenz-unbrauchbar-ist,corona-hospitalisierung-analyse-100.html

She did. Said get the flu shot ASAP as well. A week later the COVID booster had been approved and I had both the flu and COVID booster done at my local pharmacy.

Went to my next appointment last week and saw a different person in the practice. They started in on checking if I’d done those two vaccines yet. The nurse was visibly relieved when I said I had already done so. “Oh, good, I don’t have to go into my spiel.”

One of my coworkers at my job last spring when I got vaccinated before I was pregnant was looking to get pregnant in the near future. She and her fiancé (getting married in the summer) didn’t want to get the vaccine because they were concerned about fertility. I sure hope she changed her mind since. 

My OB at my first visit told me how a father at the hospital wouldn’t wear his mask and this wasn’t allowed to see his child in the NICU. He says “well, I guess I’ll meet my child when they come home.” Has a realization about that at my second visit sitting in the waiting room where masks are required all over the office: he probably never went to the OB visits with his wife.",,,,1635005374,{},hhr4cqa,False,t3_qe47gc,False,False,t1_hhqsl7w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qe47gc/despite_higher_covid_risk_most_pregnant_americans/hhr4cqa/,1635149117.0,22,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,rainbow658,,,[],,,,text,t2_1z795u1m,False,False,[],"My question with all of this myocarditis concern is that we truly don’t have a baseline. Prior to Covid, it was rare to order an MRI of the cardiac muscle to look for myocarditis in children and young men without major symptoms or symptomatic athletes post-infection (influenza, etc) that need medical clearance to return to play. 

We honestly have no idea how many people walk around with very mild, transient myocarditis or pericarditis post infection or vaccination. It potentially could be a more common side effect of the immune response and/or hyper-response of the immune system, inflammation, or even allergic reaction. 

This is regarding more serious acute myocarditis, but it can be caused by a mutinied of triggers, including drug reactions, inflammation, toxins, or allergic reactions: 

“Acute myocarditis is a serious, likely underdiagnosed condition affecting people of all ages and for which the number of UK hospital admissions is rising. A primary diagnosis of myocarditis accounted for 0.04% (36.5 per 100,000) of all hospital admissions in England between 1998 and 2017, although this is likely to be an underestimate of the true burden of myocarditis. The aetiology is broad, including infective and inflammatory conditions as well as exposure to toxic agents. Clinical features are varied and overlap with other acute cardiac conditions making diagnosis a challenge. “

When u point out that someone who is double jabbed can still catch it and spread it, they immediately get upset, even thou it is a fact. U have a 50-95% protection when jabbed, the higher % are that of getting covid badly or being hospitalized. The 50% is for catching it. They just don’t explain or separate the data correctly and say this. 

Also in Mass they had 75% vaccinated in the hosp, people got confused, but they have one of the highest vaccination rate in the country, so ofc u see more vaccinated people hospitalized as they r the majority now there. It doesn’t mean it doesn’t work, it just means these r the odds in a fully vaccinated area. 50-95% protection, so seeing a high % doesn’t mean it isn’t working it is just admitting that yes u still catch it and can get sick; if they weren’t vaccinated the hospitals would be a lot higher and have a lot more deaths. It works, just not completely from catching the virus. 

Our doctor office down here sees just as many vaxxed and unvaxxed ppl testing positive. It is what it is, but pointing it out people get upset and freak out. Also people think ur against them for pointing out that u want sources. 

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html

Even the cdc states, the vaccines biggest upside is that u won’t get a severe case of it or end up in the hospital, u can still catch it and spread it, so they should technically test everyone 2 times a week to be safe. This is the only way to prevent spreading, knowing that u do not have it and testing to make sure. 

I know so many vaxxed who won’t get tested even thou they r sick and probably have it, they just refuse and say it is allergies or a cold. U do not know unless u test, simple logic! 

I just don’t get why so many refuse to get tested. They r cheap and in Sam’s and Costco for $15. Or free if u have insurance. Takes little to no time to get a test, so why not?! 

Also I am pro Vaccines I am not for forcing them. I think everyone comes around on their own. And if they medically cannot get it and have multiple doctors who will attest to this they shouldn’t lose their jobs over it. They should be allowed to continue their lives without losing everything. Esp if they agree to get tested regularly, I don’t see the harm if u don’t have it, not sure why people who don’t have it are not allowed to live just because they aren’t vaxxed.

Take Moderna. If you [read the protocol](https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/providers/clinical-trial-data) for the phase 3, one of the listed objectives is,

&gt; To evaluate the efficacy of mRNA-1273 to prevent asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.
&gt;
&gt; Vaccine efficacy to prevent the first occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the absence of symptoms defining COVID-19 starting 14 days after the second IP dose.SARS-CoV-2 infection determined by seroconversion assessed by bAb levels against SARS-CoV-2 as measured by a ligand-binding assay specific to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and with a negative NP swab sample for SARS-CoV-2 at Day 1 (Section 8.1.1).

Hence the day 29 NP.

First it was get vaccinated and the world is your oyster. Lose masks, go back to normal (almost), whole bit. Ok, did that.

Then it was “uh nevermind put the mask back on if you’re vaccinated”.  Ok…sure. Alright. Science changes.  We’ll go with it.

Now it might turn into “you must get the booster or you aren’t fully vaccinated”.

And these are just the highlights. There’s been a lot of this along the way. Delta is fine, then it wasn’t. Being inside was fine, then it wasn’t.  Masks weren’t needed, then they were, then they weren’t, then they are again.

I’m not arguing that science changes and people need to be flexible, but at some point all of this changing direction and mixed messaging loses people, even the ones that have followed along and agreed up to this point.

I’ll get my third shot because I see the benefit in it and I understand the science and have been on the more cautious side this whole time, but even my patience is wearing thin.

To say that something is wet means that the water on the surface of that something can be removed. You get caught outside in the rain, you say “Aw, my hair got wet, now I gotta get it redid.” “Aw, my shoes got wet, now I gotta let’em sit outside, and dry.” You don’t say, that the ocean gets wet, it’s just water, water is water. Fire, right? We know that it burns things right? But it’s not in and of itself burned, right? Water, it wets things but it’s not in and of itself wet. Okay? The word wet is only supposed to be used when water gets on something. For example if I were to splash water on this mirror right here and say it’s wet, but if it were somehow possible to splash water droplets onto water, well you could see the water droplets sitting on the water, you’d say “Oh that water is wet!” But the term wet is an adjective that is only conditional, that’s used to describe the surface of something that is typically dry.

Think of the boy that yelled wolf. Eventually trust is broken regardless of how or why. They see politician kids working in these companies, so now they trust no one. I can’t blame them for this, this is what they witnessed for 50 yrs before the internet was big like it is now. Before information was everywhere, and even thou most do not believe everything they see online, if it gets enough attention they take note.

Sadly now they are stopping grading in schools in some states. This is going to be the downfall of society, more stupidity, less education, less trade skills,etc. People are not going to push to try harder in school but just get by. Russia only accepts the top 25% after 5th grade, then 8th then in HS. They push kids to learn more and actually teach them why they have to learn. They show them the life they can have if educated and the life they won’t have if not. We do not explain this to our children in school, we expect them to figure it out.

This peak has been building for a long time.  It was worrisome back at the end of August, then kids went back to school.  There are no state-wide rules on masking in schools.  It is up to the individual school districts.  With predictable results.  Someone posted on here, I think it was last week, how so many of MI's cases are school-driven right now.

Also, school sports season, see above.

Weather was great til this week.  Now it is finally fall-like.  That may make a difference shortly.

Many people have pandemic fatigue and are not wearing masks.

My local downtown only requires them on the unvaccinated and shockingly, a couple of store owners came down with breakthrough infections.  Also, a friend of a friend, who lives in a county with under 40% vaccination got a breakthrough case, but that person eats out and socializes with unvaccinated people.

But you could say all of the above for a lot of places, so it will be interesting to see what the studies say in 10 years about MI.

&gt;While the Delta wave rolled across much of the country, some places were relatively spared.

&gt;”That fire was never able to get, for instance, into the Northeast corridor,” Dr. Vespignani said. “It’s where there’s one of the highest vaccination rates. It’s like there’s a wall.”

&gt;Some experts say that the vaccination campaign and much of the country having already experienced several waves of outbreaks — which have conferred some immunity to those who were infected and recovered — have made them cautiously optimistic for the winter.

&gt;Dr. Lessler, who helps run the Covid-19 Scenario Modeling Hub, a consortium of research groups that model the future of the outbreak, said none of the groups forecast a substantial winter peak in the United States this year.

&gt;”We might see a little bump in cases, and of course people could radically change behavior or we could see a variant,” Dr. Lessler said, but he added that he did not think a substantial peak was likely.

&gt;All the same, there are bound to remain places where the virus can spread, as each new wave has shown. And questions still remain about how long immunity will last.

&gt;”The difference between the Michigan Alpha wave in Spring 2021 and the Delta wave is really telling you that the wall that you’ve built might work for one variant, but it might not be enough for the next one,” Mr. Vespignani said. “There might be another variant that is more transmissible and with more immune evasion. That’s why we need to build the wall as high as possible.”",,,,1634985393,{},hhq90du,True,t3_qe28di,False,False,t3_qe28di,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qe28di/what_previous_covid19_waves_tell_us_about_the/hhq90du/,1635132972.0,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It really only applies to the questions you were asked and answered. If you said no you don't ever want to be put on a ventilator I would assume that they would not put you on a ventilator. 

But if you went unconscious beforehand, due to changing situations and scenario's, I wouldn't be surprised if somehow somebody would be able to slip through and still have you put on a vent if they were your next of kin or that ""one person"" you have with you when going through your medical issues (wife, kids, parents, partner, etc..) 

(I go into a tangent below explaining how hospitals are not temple's, and they are not flawless, in fact the truth is there are many hospitals out there that you can not trust with your life, or to do the the medical process properly, and the sooner you learn that, the sooner you can make a more educated decision on where to entrust people with your life.)

(Again, sorry for the tangent, once I started typing it was like opening a big wound of memories I don't visit often, so I let myself type because if I don't I'll never get any of it out, and eventually I will forget. Which is often why it comes out so freeform and blergh like a thought-process instead of like an actual piece of writing. So check out now if you are uninterested in hearing about my personal experiences with hospitals being negligent)

&amp;#x200B;

Hospitals often slip, recently the last hospital I was at basically murdered my father over the year here was there, but due to a magically overheating phone which fried my internals and video's/notes/recordings and the increasing protections surrounding doctors and nurses by themselves, and the systems at place to deal with them. In Florida, a Geriatric state, it is almost nearly impossible to land a medical malpractice case, especially if your person was on the older side, and that's absolutely wrong. But, off topic. This same hospital didn't even contact the hospital across town for his history, of which he had 100's of stays, operations, and medical situations happen there that were incredibly relevant to what was going on, but they told me they would get them, and they never did. The paperwork they had on file was outdated and inaccurate, at one point they said that my mother was his power of attorney simply because she said she was on the phone a few months back, and they simply took that as fact and began calling to ask for authorizations and such. It blew my mind, as they were never married, and haven't even been a part of eachother's lives. But a simple phone call and suddenly you are given control over someone's entire life.

Luckily I was there to correct the situation, but the point still remains, that this, compiled with the mountain of mistakes that led to my fathers death. (expired tube feed, perforated IV's, accidently overfeeding with a broken tube feed machine, accidently not giving him his pee med's for over a week and having him get rapid responded due to it for a cardiac event after 3 nitroglycerin's, general lack of care leading due a wound that went all the way to his spine they didn't even tell us about until it was advanced 2 weeks(he had surgery and healed from this), and then an absolute ironclad pokerface when one day they could be apologizing for telling me they made a mistake, and then the next day the same exact doctor telling me that nothing went wrong, and there is no way that something like that would ever happen. Then the nurse's would do the same thing. I felt like I was in the twilight zone. Having nurses and doctors lie to my face, seeing these thing's happening to my dad all while being unable to transfer him to his normal hospital (because he would need a doctor to accept him over there, and he was an elderly recovering stroke patient which doesn't look good, and looks worse once they give him pneumonia, sepsis, overfeed him leading to aspiration leading to ventilator, gave him expired tube feed making him puke for the first time in 40 years, basically give him a heart attack by randomly withdrawing his water meds he's taken over 60+ years every day and not realizing the mistake until he gets rapid responded, let him develop a wound literally revealing his spine while on the vent, and all the while treating the family like shit by making up lies and coordinating with doctors to restrict our visiting hours (pre-covid). At one point someone told me there was a notation saying a nurse said I threatened her and that was why I was restricted from visiting. I would never threaten anyone, much less my fathers or someones NURSE!! But they didn't like all the questions, recording, and complaining when I'd walk in after work to find my father completely un-taken care of, covered in blood from broken iv's, covered in his own filth..

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This experience took years, and was the most grueling, heart breaking thing I've ever been through. I would have considered myself an ADVANCED Hospital Regular, having well over 100+ hospital stays and logging probably 1000's of hours inside the hospital with my father, being his sole caretaker providing all medical information and making all medical decisions. I would expect to have no trouble at any hospital, I knew the tricks, I knew the process, I knew what to do. But since my father was taken to the nearest hospital, and not the one a few miles farther, he was practically murdered by a level of negligence and corruption I never knew was possible to come from our MEDICAL HEALTHCARE system. Honestly, a few of the people with parts to play in all of this, had to be truly evil people to do some of the things they did to our family. Making up lies to keep us from visiting our dying family, constantly changing restrictions knowing we only have one designated time after work to come in before visiting hours get shut down, and when they say you have to leave an hour early, most of the time I wasn't even off work yet, and they knew that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I would get help by going to the staff, but I found the worst offenders causing most of these problems was the head nurse of the floor, or that section of the floor. After reaching out to her, she acted like a friend and took all my complaints, then the next day called the VA having all my dads tri-monthly insulin/blood testing strips canceled because I'm guessing she assumed he was getting pain killers sent from the VA. She looked at my valid complaints about my fathers healthcare, and instead of dealing with any of them took it upon herself to assume I was secretly getting something from my dad dying, and called to have his VA meds canceled. After a month or two after that, my fathers month benefits stopped coming, because technically after 3 months you are no longer obligated to have your months VA benefits because you are (LIVING) at the hospital. So they just decided that he doesn't need a home to come back to anymore (renters) when he gets out of the hospital, since we are renters. Leading me to pick up more work, and have to pay for the entirely of the houses rent in a house I was living in as a 24/7 caretaker for my 90 yr old dad with no job since he couldn't be left alone too long. I went from caretaker, to business owner trying to find ways to keep the house after this monster of a woman did everything in her power to make my father be not only dying with no real help, but no family there to be with him, and no home to return to, no hope from any of the people, and no real shot at recovery like he has had every other time he's had an issue of this level. 

I know it's hard to believe anything you hear over the internet, and I know if I heard all of these things, I'd definitely be questioning the sanity of the person who was writing all of it. But for as much as it's worth, I promise you  that the message I am trying to convey to you is completely and absolutely true, alongside my story. Hospitals are not buildings that are magically immune from mistakes. More often than not I find people's mentality when going to the hospital is just, ""I am here, I am taken care of, and I am safe."" Which honest to god is how it's supposed to be. But nowadays, you cannot trust just any hospital with your life and safety, or that of your family's. They all are fully run by people, and people are the biggest fuckers of fucking stuff up, the biggest problem-maker in any business is usually the human element. Humans are liable to emotion, wear and tear, distress, distraction, they could be mean people, there's a handful of things that could lead to one of the cogs in your healthcare process to be completely shattered. Leaving you with at best a lowered standard of care, and at worst a murder that you legally can't do anything about.

If you've gotten this far, then you've earned this tidbit of wisdom that I can safely say is completely worth it, and took me way too long to learn. Do your research on local hospitals, or the hospital nearest to anywhere you live or plan to live. In an emergency, you'll always be taken to the nearest hospital. Your life, or the life of your family, may very well depend on it someday. When you wife or son's life is in someone's hands, you want it to be at a place that isn't generally considered a butcher shop like the hospital I lost my father in.",,,,1634995026,{},hhqmsd3,False,t3_qdnjhd,False,False,t1_hho5uaj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qdnjhd/conspiracy_theorists_are_pulling_family_being/hhqmsd3/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,2caeb6eb8d8e1e727ca87054fd85a27ec96d37cd,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1634995037.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,,

Amidst the ongoing pandemic, social distancing has been broadly adopted as an effective front-line defense strategy for mitigating disease transmission. Viewed through the lens of particle-based simulations of flow, the practice of social distancing corresponds to a (significant) increase in an internal length scale of the flow, namely, the radius within which particles (pedestrians) strongly repel fellow particles. In this study, we report the results of two-dimensional pedestrian dynamics simulations modeling pedestrian counter-flows under confinement, in which individual pedestrians are described as active particles that aim to maintain a target speed while avoiding collisions. By systematically varying two quantities—the pedestrian density and the degree of social distancing—we compute fundamental diagrams for confined and socially distanced pedestrian flows, which show average pedestrian speed as a function of density and social distancing. These results reveal the sensitive dependence of average velocity on both independent variables, including a social distancing-induced jamming transition. These results highlight the need for both deliberate planning and careful public-health messaging regarding social distancing as shared indoor spaces return to appreciable levels of occupation.",,,,1634994556,{},hhqly58,True,t3_qe4mla,False,False,t3_qe4mla,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qe4mla/social_distancing_slows_down_steady_dynamics_in/hhqly58/,1635139805.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,MacrosInHisSleep,,,[],,,,text,t2_55zu6,False,False,,"Do you, by any chance, remember hearing the famous study which was commonly believed about how drinking in moderation was in fact healthier than not drinking at all?

In fact, if you looked it up, you'd see these beautiful graphs which showed the death risk of people, plotted against the average number of drinks per day they consumed. Invariably the graphs would start at some point, followed by a little dip, followed by a steady trend upwards, and that dip of course, was that health benefit. (You can still see these graphs floating around if you look it up btw). 

As you can probably guess by my use of the past tense, it turned out that the study that these results were based on had a huge flaw. They combined the results of teetotalers (people who never drink) with the results of people who stopped drinking because of health reasons, including health reasons which occurred due to heavy drinking. 

Decades later, when they decided to redo the study to account for that, that... I can't even call it a bias... Blunder? Negligence? Incompetence? Whatever... Then the slope of the graph you'd plot from the results was constantly increasing, as one would expect. No bump in sight. 

Think about that for a moment...

So yeah. Personally, when I hear unintuitive claims about health benefits from unexpected sources, I take them with a huge grain of salt. 

Also because you shouldn't believe anything someone tells you on reddit alone, here's an article with a link to the source behind what I just described:

https://time.com/5376552/how-much-alcohol-to-drink-study/

And here's the relevant part:

&gt; Meanwhile, some studies have questioned the long-standing idea that moderate drinking is good for heart health. That’s in part because some older studies didn’t account for the fact that many people who don’t drink abstain either because they had addiction issues in the past, or have other health problems that force them to stay away from alcohol. Including these individuals in the general non-drinking population may have skewed research results to make teetotalers as a whole group look unhealthier than they actually are",,,,1634994549,{},hhqlxod,False,t3_qdv79r,False,True,t1_hhpsg31,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qdv79r/people_who_got_covid19_vaccines_were_less_likely/hhqlxod/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,57354d30ad297193c9313e49b920ab2d5bd22d64,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1634994562.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,,

Background  
Data on pediatric COVID-19 has lagged behind adults throughout the pandemic. An understanding of SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics in children would enable data-driven public health guidance.  
  
Methods  
Respiratory swabs were collected from children with COVID-19. Viral load was quantified by RT-PCR; viral culture was assessed by direct observation of cytopathic effects and semiquantitative viral titers. Correlations with age, symptom duration, and disease severity were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences were compared with contemporaneous sequences.  
  
Results  
110 children with COVID-19 (median age 10 years, range 2 weeks-21 years) were included in this study. Age did not impact SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Children were most infectious within the first five days of illness, and severe disease did not correlate with increased viral loads. Pediatric SARS-CoV-2 sequences were representative of those in the community and novel variants were identified.  
  
Conclusions  
Symptomatic and asymptomatic children can carry high quantities of live, replicating SARS-CoV-2, creating a potential reservoir for transmission and evolution of genetic variants. As guidance around social distancing and masking evolves following vaccine uptake in older populations, a clear understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in children is critical for rational development of public health policies and vaccination strategies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.",,,,1634993915,{},hhqkt5p,True,t3_qe4fww,False,False,t3_qe4fww,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qe4fww/virologic_features_of_sarscov2_infection_in/hhqkt5p/,1635139208.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What is already known about this topic?  
  
Although deaths after COVID-19 vaccination have been reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, few studies have been conducted to evaluate mortality not associated with COVID-19 among vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.  
  
What is added by this report?  
  
During December 2020–July 2021, COVID-19 vaccine recipients had lower rates of non–COVID-19 mortality than did unvaccinated persons after adjusting for age, sex, race and ethnicity, and study site.  
  
What are the implications for public health practice?  
  
There is no increased risk for mortality among COVID-19 vaccine recipients. This finding reinforces the safety profile of currently approved COVID-19 vaccines in the United States.

Instead, the trial compares the amount of neutralizing antibodies induced by the vaccine in the children to the response of older recipients in the adult trial.”

There also is no mention of what percentage/length of time of the trials included the Delta variant, which has shown to reduce efficacy in adults. 

Would a third dose (booster, but truly a third dose) be more beneficial in children as it is in adults?  Most pediatric vaccines include a three-dose regimen.

He admitted to withholding the full truth about face masks during the initial days of the pandemic. Even if it was done with good intentions (these were days when PPE was still scarce and needed in hospitals), it had the effect of reducing public trust in public guidelines, because there is now no longer any guarantee that these guidelines are purely from scientific considerations and free of value judgment. A side-effect is that to this day, cloth masks and gaiters are still widespread in the US, even though we know N95 (or KN95 or FFP2) work a lot better. I see hardly anyone in supermarkets bothering with good masks. (Though obviously cloth masks are still much better than nothing at all.) The CDC is scared of updating its guidelines because the public is now not in a mood to believe that such updates are from scientific considerations alone. This is a hole the CDC dug themselves into.

Another example: eviction moratoriums. The CDC made a value judgment (""the risk to at-risk tenants is valued more than the risk to landlords""). Whether you agree with this judgment or not, it was not a scientific judgment, and the CDC should have stayed out of it. If anyone had to actually make this call, it should have been democratically elected officials, preferably at the local or state levels.

Yet one more example: the CDC declaring last year that racism was a public health issue.

[],,Neece235,,,[],,,,text,t2_3k0dwywc,False,False,[],"U remember when the geniuses who started the dot com era didn’t goto college? Genius can happen without education for some things. The problem is interpretation. Do u remember the nerd movies? They tried to twist things and make fun of but the main point was the nerds (in the end) had the girls and the money. Most didn’t see the actual context of the movies only say them as funny. Needless to say, intelligence and academia are not hand in hand with certain professions. Which makes it harder for some to distinguish between science and other professions. One u need an education and the other u can self learn, needless to say there r some (very few) who r geniuses without ever going to school. And there r some career college students who are dumber than a box of rocks.

What the main issue is, people watched the government lie to them for decades, so now they do not believe anything they say. Imagine (before the internet) ur told smoking cigarettes is healthy, or lead in gasoline and paint was safe, or deet kills everything but it completely safe in humans, or countless other drugs or chemicals they swore were safe, but now we know we were lied too. Now imagine being 60+, u have the internet where some doctors and scientists are speaking out about this virus and vax. In the past the few that spoke out had their lives ruined, and some killed, we witnessed it thru the years. Then they apologize and say that those scientists were correct, meanwhile they lost their reputations and worse for speaking up. Now we have the internet, where any c student scientist can speak up. And they r anti this and that. As a 60 yo who do u believe? The government, who lied to them their whole lives, and they lose their parents and loved ones from these chemicals? Or these scientists that the government is trying to shut down?

Simple perception, find a way to talk with one another, esp those who do not trust the government, and help them to see that this is real, and even if we don’t know long term effects of the vaccine, the long term effects of covid are worse. Help them to not trust the government but at the least trust their kid, or parent, etc.

In the United States, we have an abundance of COVID vaccines; we watch helplessly as anti-vaxxers turn up their noses at preventative medicine, and die horrible, torturous deaths.


Meanwhile, many countries are being left behind and unable to vaccinate their populations. Only 20% of people in low-income countries have received a first dose of vaccine compared to 80% in high- and upper-middle income countries.


With such low vaccination rates in lower income countries, strict behavioral measures have to remain for the foreseeable future, and they potentially become breeding grounds for new variants.


The global picture of access to COVID-19 vaccines is unacceptable, let's make a difference.

-The country was already under covid restrictions therefore did the constant reminding to wear a mask - also remind people to socially distant and obey covid protocol

-Due to the fact the country was under restriction. Some of the more major areas for spread were shut, this means the 9% reduction only applied as a 9% reduction after all these reductions. Meaning its unlikely to persist once these major areas reopen.

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm



Click on daily updates by week and state. 1,021,135 Americans have died of respiratory disease (covid, flu, or pneumonia) since the beginning of 2020. 


Official covid deaths are 729,543. That's a difference of ~300,000 right there. Now, I'm not saying *all* of those were covid deaths. But we normally lose 50k people to flu and pneumonia **in a bad year** and flu levels this past flu season were the lowest they've been, well, ever (and yes we are still testing for it) it is safe to say that's *at least* an extra 200,000 body bags we didn't count.

200,000 / 729,543 = so that's an additional 27.4% of deaths that we likely missed. And that's just **confirmed respiratory infections**. I'm not even talking about blood clots and strokes and heart attacks that may have been due to covid, but were misattributed due to lack of testing or because they happened weeks or even months after the person ""recovered"" but the virus already wrecked their organs.



Alternatively subtract 9,500 (deaths where influenza played *any* role) from 1,021,000 (deaths from respiratory infections overall) and there's your covid deaths: 1,011,500. But bacterial and fungal pneumonias do exist, not to mention a few flu cases that might've flown under the radar so I tried to be fair. 


In reality, we are probably already over 1 million deaths in the US.

Last weekend in Kingston, when 8,000 swarmed the road, laneways, lawns, trees, porches and rooftops of Aberdeen Street, police arrested 36 people. More than 50 others received $2,000-$10,000 fines for attending, hosting or sponsoring an “aggravated nuisance party.” Kingston Police partnered with officers from Durham Region and Ontario Provincial Police.

“With COVID, the stakes are much higher,” says Deane. “A nuisance party is a nuisance party if there isn’t a public health risk.”

Deane has studied the evolution of these parties over decades.

“It is a human phenomenon that I think has taken an interesting turn because of social media.”

Denmo, the Hamilton-based YouTube star whose Canadian university homecoming and prank shows in recent years have attracted millions of views, agrees.

“These guys all live that,” he says. “Anything for the Snapchat, anything for the video. They want to get featured flipping the car. Until the hammer drops.”

Deane recalls the first time he saw a bird’s-eye perspective of a Queen’s party on Aberdeen Street, about 15 years ago. “I remember being in the police command centre and looking at the image on the street below and being struck that it was sort of like an amoeba.

“It had form and shape. But it had no centre. For many of us, the feeling is you're always trying to address the problem on its margins because the centre is not knowable or reachable. Who organizes it? Impossible to say. It’s an organic thing.”

He still sees the amoeba but he also sees something else.

“These are many students just desperate for a social opportunity or students feeling rebellious after a year and a half of constraint. We do understand it. But at the same time, we have to communicate that this is a challenge for the whole good of the community as well as a potential danger to themselves.”

In late September, Dalhousie University asked students who attended an unsanctioned street party to avoid classes for a week and get a COVID-19 test. Police arrested nine men and one woman for public intoxication.

Owen Lorimer, 18, a first-year computing student at Queen’s, wishes the school would host organized in-person events for students.

“Being like a community within a school makes it fun,” he said.

The Alma Mater Society, Queen’s student association, is working on that.

The society recently got permission from the school to start processing event-sanctioning requests from clubs, which means students will soon be allowed to legally start socializing again on campus within a few weeks.

For the past five years, Western University has spent $250,000 annually to help police control student crowds on London’s Broughdale Avenue, which have grown to 25,000 people.

Last month, president Alan Shephard spoke frankly in an email to Western students about the school’s “culture problem,” which he summarized as an excessive focus on drinking and partying. He urged students to avoid homecoming parties.

“The potential for injury and violence is real,” the email said. “Please choose to avoid these highly dangerous events.”

In 2016, the school moved its homecoming celebrations to late October, hoping the students’ itch to gather and stage “fake” homecoming street parties would wear off. It didn’t.

In 2019, a few months before the pandemic closed campus, the school tried another approach. Western’s University Students’ Council launched PurpleFest, a sanctioned day-long party in Western’s football stadium featuring food, drinks and “top-tier” musicians. Tickets cost $60.

The headliner, rapper A$AP Rocky, didn’t show. He was detained in Sweden because of a criminal matter. The party on Broughdale continued.

That year, London increased fines for street parties, and the university revised its student code of conduct, empowering the university to punish students for illegal conduct off campus. With these new measures in place, Western last month held its first September homecoming since 2015.

Rain, heavy police presence and what the school has summarized as “recent events” likely all factored into a substantially subdued affair this year on Broughdale, with only a few hundred people taking to the street in late September.

McMaster University cancelled its official homecoming event this year but an impromptu street bash happened anyway, which saw more than 2,000 young people — double the size from previous years — damage a neighbourhood and overturn a car.

Hamilton police have arrested and charged five men age 18 to 20 with mischief over $5,000 for damaging the white Mazda hatchback and street signs. They include two students from McMaster, one from Waterloo University, one from York University and a 20-year-old man from Smithville, who was not a student.

Dr. Sandra Mendlowitz, a Toronto-based psychologist who counsels post-secondary patients across Canada, says it’s incredibly easy for students to get caught up in groupthink. Especially this year with the pandemic, which has increased anxiety and created a lot of pent-up emotions.

“Kids who were predisposed to mental health problems got worse, and kids who wouldn’t have suffered are,” she says.

Every crowd develops its own energy, she adds, which has a contagion effect.

“Kids think they can become lost in the masses. But the decision-making process can fall apart. Problem solving and making good decisions go out the window when you’re riled up.”

Still, students have to be accountable.

“It’s very easy for parents to come and rescue their kids, but this is not something they should be rescued from.”

University of Calgary researchers studied the growing phenomenon of off-campus street parties and published their findings last year in the Journal of American College Health.

The university doesn’t have a traditional homecoming event. Instead, its student union throws a year-end gathering on campus called Bermuda Shorts Day. In 2017, students created their own party on the same day in a neighbouring residential community, and over the years the size of that gathering has grown exponentially with thousands of people drinking in the street, breaking bottles and blocking traffic. University officials were worried about the unsanctioned party’s trajectory.

The study found students who attended off-campus parties in North America face a greater risk of alcohol poisoning, drug overdose, increased aggression and sexual assault.

Researchers wanted to understand what drew students to these street parties, which in Calgary was only a few hundred metres from where the on-campus event was taking place.

Few academic institutions in North America have done this work.

“We are a research-intensive institution,” said Susan Barker, University of Calgary’s vice-provost, student experience. Her office funded the study. “We believe in evidence-informed decision making. We needed evidence in order to make decisions about how we were going to move forward.”

A person is arrested by Kingston police on Aberdeen Street in the University District during Queen's University's homecoming on Oct. 16.

Calgary researchers surveyed almost 500 university students.

The study found students wanted a greater variety of affordable alcohol and food, better music, ideally a DJ, and a more relaxed atmosphere.

“The on-campus party was seen as going to a party where your parents are,” says Barker, whose office funded the research. “It was heavily supervised, ticketed and controlled.”

Barker thinks schools in Ontario should do their own research to understand more specifically what’s motivating young people and develop evidence-based plans.

“It’s almost like a rite of passage that students expect this is going to happen at this stage of their university experience,” she says. “I don’t know if you can break the cycle.”

Moving forward, Barker says, it’s a question of balance. “How can you manage to keep students safe and to keep the community safe and of course to not use up all the police or health resources on a particular day? I don’t know if I’m being idealistic in thinking we can find a happy medium. I’d like to think we could.”

Wilder than ever: why a pandemic backlash and social media are fuelling mayhem at Canada’s universities
By Diana ZlomislicInvestigative ReporterSat., Oct. 23, 2021timer9 min. read
12-16 minutes

KINGSTON, ONT.—For a few hours last Saturday morning, homecoming at Queen’s University was shaping into a low-key event. Lightning lit the sky, rain pelted sideways and roads were flooded.

Jack Denmo, a social media influencer who documents the antics of drunk students at events like these across Ontario and spins the material into feature-length movies for his YouTube channel, hit the University District with a small film crew. They approached Aberdeen Street, a stretch of student housing notorious for unsanctioned street parties, just before lunch.

“It doesn’t look like you’ll get enough to fill an hour,” a reporter said. “I’m not worried,” he smiled.

An hour later, about 8,000 mostly unmasked people were suddenly jumping in unison on the street, climbing roofs, hanging from trees, throwing bottles from second-storey windows and setting off fireworks.

Before the day was over, two Ottawa men, who were not students but had been partying in this crowd, were found murdered five kilometres from campus. Kingston Police are also investigating a stabbing that occurred early next morning when the homecoming crowd moved to Victoria Park.

Jack Denmo, middle, also known as King of the North, splashes some beer with Queen's University students in the University district during Queen's homecoming.

School officials, city and police are bracing for a similar hell this weekend with students expected to stage a second “fake” homecoming party within the University District.

Out-of-control, off-campus university parties plagued by drunken violence have been a recurring theme across Canada this fall as schools reopen their doors after the pandemic forced an 18-month break. Police, school officials and psychologists think pandemic backlash and the growing use of live photo- and video-sharing features on social media networks are fuelling wilder events than in the past.

They’ve also noted a “double-cohort effect.” While homecoming parties and similar unsanctioned gatherings have been primarily a rite of passage among freshmen, this year’s crowds include scores of second-year students who missed the experience last year because they had been living and learning in isolation.

Coast to coast, universities are struggling to contain these events and minimize damage to the community and students.

Queen’s staff and students have spent the week knocking on hundreds of doors across the University District begging students to avoid joining the crowd today and tomorrow.

“For your own personal safety and that of others, I urge you to re-think your participation in these activities — especially if drugs or alcohol are involved, as there is a risk of being insufficiently aware of your surroundings and of potential danger posed by others,” said Patrick Deane, the university’s principal and vice-chancellor.

For example, most students were unaware they may have been partying with a convicted criminal.

Police would not confirm that Nico Soubliere, 29, one of the men found murdered a few hours after partying with students last weekend, was the same person who fled a federal halfway house in New Brunswick while serving an eight-year sentence for manslaughter. He was convicted in the 2012 killing of a 24-year-old Ottawa man whose body was found in a schoolyard.

Soubliere and Carl-Alen Delphin, 20, were shot near a parking lot off of Highway 401. Delphin died on scene. Soubliere died in hospital Monday. Kingston police are looking to speak with partygoers who talked with the victims.

Queen’s is not the only school touched by violence this fall.

Western University is mourning the deaths of two students, and investigating allegations of mass sexual assaults and drugging at a campus residence.

Josue Silva, 18, a second-year business undergraduate, was shot at a party within a 10-minute drive of campus a month before orientation week. First-year student Gabriel Neil, 18, died after being beaten in a parking lot plaza near his campus residence on Sept. 11.

Emily Altmann, 19, Carlos Guerra Guerra, 20, and Dylan Schapp, 19, have been charged with second-degree murder in Silva’s death. Aliyan Ahmed, 21, and Haroun Raselma, 19, are charged with manslaughter in Neil’s death. Raselma is at large and a national warrant is out for his arrest. The school and police won’t say whether any of those arrested were also students. In releasing Altmann on bail to her parents’ home, the court banned her from using the internet unless supervised for video court appearances.

Police meanwhile have no leads on about 30 cases of drugging and assault that allegedly occurred at Medway-Sydenham Hall, which were reported on social media.

At the University of Guelph, hundreds of partiers surrounded a police cruiser carrying a handcuffed teen who had been arrested. They smashed the windshield and tore off a side mirror. In the melee, one male snuck up and opened the rear driver’s side door to release his friend inside. Neither got far. Both face court dates in January.

Some schools this year are spending unprecedented amounts to support community policing. Queen’s more than doubled its allocation to the city of Kingston for extra policing of parties in the University District to $350,000 from $100,000.",,,,1635017877,{},hhrwff5,False,t3_qe98qj,False,False,t3_qe98qj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qe98qj/wilder_than_ever_why_a_pandemic_backlash_and/hhrwff5/,1635163654.0,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
