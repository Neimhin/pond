ANTHONY MASON: Right. You talked about this a little bit, but tell me more. What do we know about people who have been vaccinated? Can they spread the virus?

ROCHELLE WALENSKY: So we have now a series of studies that have been looking and testing people who are vaccinated week after week or every other week just to screen them. The rates of asymptomatic infection are really extraordinarily low in those situations. Not zero, but extraordinarily low. We also know that these vaccines in a real world setting have shown 90% to 95%, 97% efficacy.

Yes, we are occasionally seeing infections that occur in people who are vaccinated. But what we're seeing about those infections is that they tend to have a lower amount of virus. They tend to be asymptomatic. They tend to be mild.

In actuality there is very real uncertainty about the degree to which a previous covid infection confers immunity.  The vaccine has been rigorously tested and there is much more certainty.

The idea that natural immunity is unreliable is not a myth pushed with an agenda - it's just actually a plausible thing that needs to be reckoned with, as opposed to dismissed as a conspiracy.

NYT: Immunity to the Coronavirus May Persist for Years, Scientists Find

From [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/health/coronavirus-immunity-vaccines.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage): 

&gt;Immunity to the coronavirus lasts at least a year, possibly a lifetime, improving over time especially after vaccination, according to two new studies. The findings may help put to rest lingering fears that protection against the virus will be short-lived.  
&gt;  
&gt;Together, the studies suggest that most people who have recovered from Covid-19 and who were later immunized will not need boosters. Vaccinated people who were never infected most likely will need the shots, however, as will a minority who were infected but did not produce a robust immune response.  
&gt;  
&gt;Both reports looked at people who had been exposed to the coronavirus about a year earlier. Cells that retain a memory of the virus persist in the bone marrow and may churn out antibodies whenever needed, according to one of the studies, [published on Monday](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03647-4) in the journal Nature.  
&gt;  
&gt;The other study, posted online at BioRxiv, a site for biology research, found that these so-called memory B cells [continue to mature and strengthen](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.08.416636v1) for at least 12 months after the initial infection.",,,1622104997,{},gzm6a02,False,t3_nhqai1,False,True,t1_gyzy8lj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nhqai1/unvaccinated_americans_are_less_worried_about/gzm6a02/,1622199974,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This was for a period between March 1 2020 and January 2 2021. From these numbers the *official* covid toll represents about 72.4%. 

Not all of the excess deaths are ""hidden covid"", but a large number would be such, but it will a lot more research to ferret this out. there are basically two reasons for a country undercounting covid deaths. One is an inability to count. India and Brazil are examples of this. Another is deliberate falsification. It's my opinion that China and Russia, especially Russia, were dishonest earlier in the pandemic but became more honest as time went by. 

In terms of 'ability to count' the USA is undoubtedly better than India or Brazil. It is, however, less efficient at this than a civilized country with universal free healthcare. As to deliberate lying about the real numbers the only case I am aware of was Florida. The big scandal in New York wasn't about how many people died but rather about where they died. The final numbers were the same, but the State classified many nursing home deaths as 'hospital deaths'.

They're absolutely free to completely and totally walk away from the potentially life-changing amount of money if they find any part of it distasteful. That is their free and uncoerced choice.

&gt; I'm uncomfortable normalizing the sharing of private health information

It's not ""normalizing"" it. It's saying, ""You want X, you must do Y"" in this one specific, once in a century pandemic. We likewise have politicians occasionally voluntarily offer up their health records. That doesn't ""normalize"" it, it's a special case. Just because we're doing this vaccine-based lottery doesn't mean suddenly HIPAA disappears or anything else.

&gt; That doesn't make it better, that makes it worse.

I don't see how. They have a price, the price is paid. That's how all of human society works. If you find that objectionable, do you find earning money generally objectionable?

&gt; Watching people do mildly yucky things for money is very distasteful to me.

Well unfortunately, society has **always** had that to some extent. Janitors exist. People who masturbate bulls to get their semen to inseminate cows exist. Lots of ""dirty"" jobs exist, where people have to do mildly yucky things for money.

And that's not going away until we automate everything.",,,1622150972,{},gzoozra,False,t3_nm4h2u,False,True,t1_gzoo6qv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nm4h2u/ohio_announces_winner_of_first_vaccination_lottery/gzoozra/,1622255199,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I got buddies that out right deny that covid even exists! I’ve known people for years that I’d consider moderates come out and say I’m a conservative and I believe in this and that and they didn’t have a single political bone in their body a year and a half ago atleast not vocal about it. 

I’ve met pilots who fly medics and medical personnel outright tell me this is all a hoax... I’ve met passengers and pilots from Florida and Texas vocally flaunt their disregard for anything covid related. Calling us crazy for asking them to wear a mask in our FBO. I was shocked to learn that in certain counties people look at you funny if you *do* wear a mask. I’ve probaly seen 4 maskless people in the entirety of the pandemic in public setting here in toronto.

Serum institute at least did it properly and is producing the AZ though not at quantities originally promised, not making as much available to covax ($3 per dose was agreed when they got the funding) as was the plan (and the funding they got including from US), and are selling to private hospitals and exporting sizable amounts to other countries for $8 per dose. They could be making much higher quantities if they made one of their traditional vaccines but they wouldn't be able to export as much or at the prices they currently are able to demand. 

Bio E is even (far) worse. They agreed a technology transfer with JJ back in August 2020 and they still have not made a single dose. At the same time they are communicating left and right that they will be making 70 million/month of their own subunit vaccine (traditional one) in August but in reality they are not even doing proper trials, their phase 1/2 was 360 people and their phase 3 is about 1700 in India (supposedly they will do in other countries as well), however since not only phase 3 hasn't started but it is not even in any clinical trial register anywhere (I checked India, US, EU, UK). It's appaling really since Baylor college in the US not only made and validated the vaccine for them, but also they modeled it exactly after Bio E's own Hepatitis B vaccine so there is no technology transfer required. But you see that one is meant to sell for about $1.5 to $3.0 so not much in it for them. Not only that but yesterday it was revealed that the deal with Bio E and JJ does not include ANY quantities for India, ALL of it supposed to go back to JJ (see link below).

Bharat biotech made India proud by producing their good old inactivated vaccine. The only co in India that did not go after technology transfer first and foremost and they are simply doing their job and duty.

Dr reddys is waiting to produce the Russian one and Zydus is doing a commendable work into advancing their DNA vaccine through clinical trials (28000 people vs 1700 for bio e) and they are close to approval.

There is another implication in this tech transfer frenzy in India. AZ, Sputnik, Bharat's and JJ ALL of them require BSL 3 facilities (that allows them to handle virus during production) so now there is a BSL3 facility shortage and an in essence artifical bottleneck just because they want the technology. At least Bharat did their own thing and had no choice, let's say Serum Institute with AZ was first at least they are actually producing. The rest put themselves in a pit for no good reason other than the transfer, and who cares whether they can actually produce in time. Right? Right

The study initiated by Sanofi (SASY.PA) and GSK (GSK.L) is one of the first late stage trials that combines tests for boosters and variants, as drugmakers adapt their strategies to deal with an evolving coronavirus.

The two drugmakers, which earlier this month reported positive interim results, confirmed their double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study would include more than 35,000 adults in the United States, Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

""In a two-stage approach, the study will initially investigate the efficacy of a vaccine formulation targeting the original virus, while a second stage will evaluate a second formulation targeting the B.1.351 virus,"" Sanofi said.

The virus lineage known as B.1.351 was first detected in South Africa.

""Recent scientific evidence shows that antibodies created against the B.1.351 variant may provide broad cross-protection against other more transmissible variants,"" Sanofi said.

""The design of the Phase III, conducted across a broad diversity of geographies, also allows evaluation of the efficacy of the candidate against a variety of circulating variants,"" the French drugmaker added in a statement.

Sanofi also confirmed it would begin clinical studies in the coming weeks to assess the efficacy of the vaccine as a booster, regardless of what vaccine a subject may have received first.

Pending a positive phase III outcome, the vaccine could be approved in the fourth quarter after it was initially targeted for the first half of the year before a setback. read more

&gt;At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Vivian Balakrishnan, the foreign minister of Singapore, predicted that the novel coronavirus was going to pose an “acid test of every single country’s quality of health care, standard of governance, and social capital.” His observations turned out to be prescient; countries in Southeast Asia, including Singapore, escaped the worst of the pandemic by relying on their strengths in these three areas. By contrast, nearby India has failed on all three counts as it contends with an overwhelming, devastating second wave of the virus.

&gt;New case totals have dipped from their peak of over 400,000 in early May, but the scale of the crisis in India is still staggering. Official figures of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India are vast underestimates: the government itself suggests that reported cases reflect only one in 25 to 30 actual infections. By that metric, India may have had as many as 700 million cases even though it has reported only 26 million cases. The number of COVID-19 deaths is likely four times the official figure, reaching upward of roughly 1.2 million—by far the highest total in the world.

&gt;India had many disadvantages going into the pandemic. It has what can at best be described as a weak health system because of decades of underinvestment. Indians are more likely than other populations to have undetected hypertension or diabetes, both of which make severe cases of COVID-19 more likely. Indian health-care facilities are prone to high rates of secondary bacterial infections, which are lethal to many COVID-19 patients. And authorities have not always adhered to international guidelines and evidence on the treatment of COVID-19, often causing as much damage to patients as the virus itself.

&gt;The current predicament demands international attention. Other countries must help India comprehensively control COVID-19 and ensure that further dangerous variants don’t emerge. COVID-19 vaccines will be crucial, as the off-ramp from this pandemic for India, as for other countries, is to vaccinate a significant proportion of its population.

They could be making much higher quantities if they made one of their traditional vaccines but they wouldn't be able to export as much or at the prices they currently are able to demand. 

Bio E is even (far) worse. They agreed a technology transfer with JJ back in August 2020 and they still have not made a single dose. At the same time they are communicating left and right that they will be making 70 million/month of their own subunit vaccine (traditional one) in August but in reality they are not even doing proper trials, their phase 1/2 was 360 people and their phase 3 is about 1700 in India (supposedly they will do in other countries as well), however since not only phase 3 hasn't started but it is not even in any clinical trial register anywhere (I checked India, US, EU, UK). It's appaling really since Baylor college in the US not only made and validated the vaccine for them, but also they modeled it exactly after Bio E's own Hepatitis B vaccine so there is no technology transfer required. But you see that one is meant to sell for about $1.5 to $3.0 so not much in it for them.

Start slow. Plan a ramp up if you aren't biking much before then plan to bike say 2 days a week for 2 weeks, then 3 days for 3 weeks until you are biking everywhere

Know how to change a tube, it is easy. Co2 pumps are awesome little lifesavers.

You are your engine. You are your heater. It will take you  a little time to sial on your outfits, if you are getting too hot, slow down. If you are too cold, speed up a bit (but be careful about getting too sweaty when it is cold out)

It will rain. I love riding in the rain. Get a good rain suit. There are great waterproof shoes from dress shoes to big boots, whatever you like. 

You will be uncomfortable occasionally as you get used to commuting by bike but stick with it and you'll learn to dress and ride in a way that will work for you and .ale you happy

&gt;  
&gt;The registry of infections of people who have passed the covid or who are vaccinated is scarce. But they are given and they are a wake-up call: it is still too early for the open bar, for the return to absolute normality. Different studies have detected infections between 10% and less than 1% of people already immunized, depending on the moment, the group, the place of the investigation and the vaccination schedule. These people, asymptomatic in most cases thanks to natural or vaccine-induced immunity, still retain the ability to harbor and spread the coronavirus for a time, even if they do not develop the disease. According to Guillermo López Lluch, professor of Cell Biology at the Pablo de Olavide University (UPO), the key to avoiding the danger of contagion being promoted, is ""to achieve the broadest possible group immunity in the shortest period of time."" ""It is a race against the virus,"" he warns.  
&gt;  
&gt;The biologist has been able to verify an infection of an immunized person in a close case: a person close to him, 92 years old and vaccinated with the double dose of one of the brands administered in Spain, had to enter a trauma hospital in Cordova. He was routinely tested for covid and tested positive, despite lacking symptoms consistent with the disease.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jocelyn Keehner and Lucy E. Horton, along with other members of the University of California (UCLA) and San Diego (UCSD) Faculties of Medicine, published last March in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) the results of an internal investigation: “The absolute risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 \[coronavirus that causes covid\] after vaccination was 1.19% among UCSD healthcare workers and 0.97 % among those from UCLA; these rates are higher than the risks reported in the trials of the coronavirus vaccine mRNA-12731 \[Moderna\] and the vaccine BNT162b2.2 \[Pfizer-BioNTech\].” The study shows the same conclusions, although with different figures, as another published last month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States and other previous ones reflected in Nature and the British Medical Journal.  
&gt;  
&gt;All these studies confirm the existence of infections in immunized patients, although their record is scarce. López Lluch explains one reason: “It is very likely that the cases are more numerous than those detected, since, in most cases, they do not produce symptoms and, therefore, these people, who are considered immunized, are not makes them PCR ”. Mark Pandori, director of the Nevada Public Health Laboratory, agrees. “We are underestimating the cases of reinfection. They are very difficult to determine, you need specialized equipment to do that work or a central laboratory, ""he explains in Scientific American.  
&gt;  
&gt;López Lluch refers to a recent study in The Lancet to argue that, although the immune response generated by vaccination or by the body itself prevents contagion and suffering from the most serious consequences of covid, there are immunized people who become infected and can be a source of spread of the virus, even if they show little or no symptoms.  
&gt;  
&gt;The cell biology specialist explains that the cause is the viral load, the amount of virus that circulates in the blood of the infected person. Immunized people have a defense line made up of B and T lymphocytes. “The former produce antibodies, they hinder the virus from entering the cell. The latter attack it directly and generate intermediaries, such as interferon, the proteins that signal the presence of a virus and prevent its proliferation ”, he simplifies to explain it.  
&gt;  
&gt;But while this system works to eliminate the infection, a person, even if he does not develop the disease, can maintain a certain viral load. In this sense, López Lluch explains: “Immunity is a matter of days. While we are not immune, the virus or pathogen has a long time to cause damage that is reflected in the symptoms, which are more serious. Our body's defenses are inefficient and take time, between 10 and 14 days, to fully activate. When we are immune, the response of B and T lymphocytes is faster and the pathogen has less time to cause damage. However, if someone immunized, but with a viral load, emits aerosols in front of someone who does not have the same defenses, they can infect it. If the other person is immunized, the ability for the disease to spread is minimal.""  
&gt;  
&gt;For this reason, the UPO biologist points out the importance of maintaining common preventive measures until vaccination is general. That reality will change, as López Lluch warns, the faster it is vaccinated and the greater its scope. ""As long as herd immunity is not achieved,"" concludes the specialist, ""mutations that confer greater infectivity to the virus will have a greater capacity to spread to more people.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The fast-spreading variants of the coronavirus carry mutations that allow it to escape part of the immune response created naturally or through vaccination, according to a new study published in Science by scientists from the US, Germany and the Netherlands. The researchers mainly focused on three mutations: K417N, E484K, and N501Y. Alone or in combination, they are found in most major SARS-CoV-2 variants and affect the spicule, the pathogen's gateway to the human cell. The scientists determined that some antibodies lose the ability to effectively neutralize the virus when mutations are present.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Reinfections**  
&gt;  
&gt;The importance of mass vaccination that includes all age groups against reinfections is also supported by neurologist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine (USA) Seth M. Glickenhaus, lead author of a study on reinfection in young people published in The Lancet:“Our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 reinfection occurs in young adults. Despite a previous infection, young people can contract the virus again and can still transmit it to others. This is an important point to know and remember as vaccine rollouts continue. Young people should receive the vaccine whenever possible, as vaccination is necessary to increase immune responses, prevent reinfection, and reduce transmission.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The study shows, according to the authors, that antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection are largely protective, but do not completely protect against reinfection in young people. The study tracked more than 3,249 members of the United States Marine Corps ( Marine Corps) between May and November 2020. About 10% (19 of 189) of participants who had previously had the disease were reinfected. . The research found that those without immunity had five times the risk of infection than participants with antibodies, but the latter still had some risk of reinfection.",,,1622083790,{},gzldp5d,True,t3_nlxu3m,False,True,t3_nlxu3m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nlxu3m/those_vaccinated_and_those_cured_of_the_covid_can/gzldp5d/,1622184189,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Maybe you're thinking of ligaments? Ligaments aren't really cells, they're the connective tissues between muscles and bones. When ligaments tear like from overworking or trauma they don't grow back well. Ligament damage is pretty serious.

If you were told this from gym class or weightlifting I wouldn't super take that as anatomy or medical info. Lots of weight lifting info is very simplified. This isn't a bad thing because when it comes to safety having your info be easy to remember is super important. I don't know if it's possible to tear muscles separately from ligaments in a similarly traumatizing way, but most of the time that ligament damage is really what you fear. Did I mention it's serious?

What I believe is more probable is that some research was conducted on how to manipulate organisms, wherein being an institute of virology specializing on bat coronaviruses, they focused on, yes, coronaviruses. Modifications were probably made to check how a certain insertion/deletion could influence virus transmissibility et. al which can all be done with cell cultures and some special techniques like CRISPR. An example would be this paper ""Retargeting of Coronavirus by Substitution of the Spike Glycoprotein Ectodomain: Crossing the Host Cell Species Barrier"" and another paper that I recall was published by the Wuhan Institute of Virology on coronavirus manipulation back on 2019. The idea is that they were public that they were doing modifications to several viruses, and I believe many of their research was medically-significant (WIH staff even recently added a new branch to the coronavirus tree, unironically), and probably some faulty protocol allowed the virus to leak to some lab workers and onto the general population.

China's response then is quiet ridiculous. They banned domestic flights before international flights, which raises into question ""How much did the CCP wanted the rest of the world to suffer with them?""

Okay, but if people do half of this (extremely doable) then they can still lose 1 lb per week just from exercise.  ~20 miles per week is not a big ask.

&gt; And 1 mile is generally 100 calories. Obviously, like you said, depends on weight. 

The 100 calorie/mile rule is not accurate for even moderately heavy people, and I think we should assume that someone trying to lose weight is on the heavier side.

&gt; It's a lot easier to drop the daily oreos

I think it just depends on how much you like the oreos.  A lot of people underestimate how desirable food is to people.

The good thing is that, once they start exercising and tracking calories burned with a fitbit or Apple Watch, it becomes very easy to make an informed decision on whether those calories are ""worth it"" or not.

Why haven't disease models been modified since acknowledgement of airborne transmission? 

Where is the aerosolization generated? Is it really from the nasopharynx and the 80 square metres of lung surface area below it has nothing to do with it? 

Is an initial period of asymptomatic lung involvement impossible?

When aerosolised virus is inhaled, do you think it magically sticks to nasopharynx and doesn't reach lungs? 

Why is high load on throat swabs not a great marker of disease severity or transmissibility? - particularly young kids - why can they have high loads on throat swabs yet are usually pathetic at transmitting? Why don't we ever hear of superspreading kids?

Or maybe aerosolization of virus is a myth?? (I don't think so)

The model of virus first entering nasopharynx, then proliferating and later moving south to lungs doesn't make much sense when you consider aerosolization. It reeks of dogma and think it's more likely the other way around in many cases.

Men tend to store fat more viscerally where as women store fat more subcutaneously. Visceral fat accumulates ceramides which activates the NLRP3 inflammasome which drives the cytokine storm we see in severe COVID cases.

So they could have similar BMIs but the type of fat is more detrimental to their outcomes. 

Another point is to do with insulin resistance and the endothelium. Insulin is an anabolic hormone which will activate the growth of endothelial cells, a totally normal process. But when circulating insulin is too high due to insulin resistance it creates an overactive growth in the endothelium causing the blood vessel walls to grow too much,  narrowing the blood vessel, increasing blood pressure and thus damaging them. 

Which comes back to sugar and diets excessive in carbohydrate causing insulin resistance.

You give it to the receptionist at the doctor's office or pharmacy and they put some numbers from it into their records.

Yes, the risk of complications in healthy children is higher with influenza, however that ignores the big picture completely. The infection rate of covid is drastically higher, meaning that unless we take measures to prevent the spread, there will be a drastically larger number of cases. So while the individual risk over covid VS influenza is not equal, the population risk is higher with covid. More cases equals more complications equals more deaths.

The whole point of masks, and lockdowns and social distancing was to reduce the spread. And guess what.. It worked. It worked so well that we had a single death in a child from influenza. That means we drastically lowered the infection rate of influenza. Yet we still had nearly as many deaths as previous years influenza totals caused by covid this year, despite everything we have done and sacrificed to limit the spread.

Think of viral load as filling a glass of water.

Let's say your body has ""x"" amount of Covid-19 viral load. It is so miniscule that it is not enough to get you sick. It is does not become infectious. Now it is almost impossible to spread that viral load. (Think of it as touching the same door handle as someone with a cold, but never catching that cold.)

Let's say after a brief encounter with someone sick you get ""y"" amount of viral load. 

The viral load is high enough that now you have become **infected and sick**. The time it takes between infection and showing signs of symptoms can be **2-4 days** maybe. In that span of **2-4 days**, you infect dozens of people close to you.

The problem is that there is no way to determine whether someone is asymptomatic or simply pre-symptomatic because it takes several days to show signs of illness. Someone who is aymptomatic will never show signs of illness. The second problem is that for many people, the signs of illness are so mild or small, that they themselves do not notice they are sick.

Asymptomatic should mean you never develop symptoms at any point. 

I'll give some references. Study from Wuahn of 10,000,000 people. Not a single case of asymptomatic transmission was found

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w

University of Washington in Florida study on it. Secondary household attack rates, which would have the highest chance of transmission, show that asymptomatic and presymptomatic combined transmission is waaaaay lower (18.0% vs 0.7%, or 25.7 times less likely) than symptomatic. And this isn't even in vaccinated individuals. Once again, that 0.7% is for both asymptomatic and presymptomatic TOGETHER. This means purely asymptomatic transmission is even lower than that.

Working classes want cheap, tasty food, that’s easy to make. In a society that promotes capitalism over health we are wired to select high processed, sugary, easy to make food. So I know what people will say... “well that’s a choice... people don’t have to buy processed unhealthy food... that’s there own fault”. But I disagree. It’s not fair for people with low incomes to be subject to a system that pushes horrible food choices. We have resources to make food really tasty and healthy but choose not to... because profits. 

Think of it this way. Your working class man making 20 dollars an hour and you want to feed your family. You walk into a grocery store and instead of buying fruits and vegetables a large demographic resorts to processed foods that are rich in sugars and fats that taste good and are easy to make. This cycle repeats itself until they get to the age of 50 or 55 years of age. You start to develope diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease. So western medicine comes along and says hey we have the technology to keep you going until age 80 with these medicines, surgeries or therapy’s so you can go back to your old habits. It’s a perpetual cycle that’s just been the status qou.  2020 had 18 million people die from heart disease worldwide (CDC). Like my grandparents whom I never got to know. Victims of heart disease. 

Covid comes along... and now we got a huge problem. Demographics with bad health habits have a really hard time overcoming this virus. So we say we need vaccines. 

The vaccines come and they become our saviour. 

Now we can go back to unfettered capitalism once covid is over... and no one will blink an eye at the constant death of heart disease that’s been killing millions for decades... and will continue to kill millions for decades to come... this is accepted. 

It’s immoral to force people to eat healthy... but if we’re going to be altruists and life is priceless shouldn’t we stop this? Maybe some notices down the chip aisle and processed food sections outlining the potential health risks of the constant eating of unhealthy foods. Like cigarettes sold in Canada with the health warnings on them. 

Our Healthcare systems rely on populations getting sick. if you think they’re in the business of curing everything and everyone there wouldn’t be a need to fund more hospitals and staff if the roots of the issues are addressed. 

It’s just this realism a lot of people don’t understand. I just want to empower people against a system that’s designed against them. 

Rich people don’t dine on “hungry man” or PC brand “chicken wings and fries” they eat healthy. 

I don’t know how else to put it. But the crux of the problem literally lies in our western culture. And that’s normal to us. 

Diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure are all completely reversible. 

Now take India for example. Scary stuff going on there. Could it be environmental factors and the opposite (malnutrition) leading to high death tolls?

Translated article:  


&gt;The Finnish pharmaceutical innovation company Covid-19 has been granted a patent by the United States Patent Office (USPTO). Therapeutica Borealis Oy , based in Turku, announced that it had received a patent for its nasal spray medicine on Monday.  
""Our next goal is to find a well-established, international pharmaceutical company whose resources would enable us to bring the medicine to market,"" says one of the drug's inventors and the founders of Therapeutica Borealis Oy, Professor Kalervo Väänänen in a press release.  
The company's patent application was approved earlier this month, and Väänänen sees the final grant of the patent as a significant milestone.  
The nasal spray developed by the company affects the function of the cells of the nasal mucosa in three ways. It prevents and impairs the virus's ability to invade and multiply. This will prevent illness and reduce the risk of serious illness.  
“Tackling a pandemic probably requires, in addition to a vaccine, a drug that prevents or acts early in the disease. The invention also helps especially in a situation where vaccine coverage threatens to remain too low for herd protection, ”says Väänänen.  
The active ingredients aprotinin, hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin used in the new drug are known and are widely used. In the present invention, however, they are used in a novel and targeted manner in the upper airway mucosa. Targeted, the amount of drug required can be considered lower. It makes treatment safer and more effective.  
Protease inhibitors prevent the virus from sticking to the cell surface and entering the cells that envelop the nasal mucosa.  
Neutralization of intracellular acidic states can prevent both virus escape from endosomes and the conversion of viral proteins to a finished form in a cellular Golgi apparatus.  
The new drug is also likely to be effective against various mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as other enveloped viruses that infect humans through the nasal mucosa.  
""The development of the drug is possible in a short time, because the molecules used are known in terms of safety and the development work can be directed to Phase II trials on efficacy and efficacy in relation to different dose sizes and dosing mechanisms,"" says Väänänen.  
The other inventors of the drug and the founders of Therapeutica Borealis are docent Lauri Kangas and psychologist Matti Rihko.",,,1622141130,{},gzo2eb5,False,t3_nmeeeh,False,True,t3_nmeeeh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nmeeeh/patent_for_a_finnish_corona_drug_new_drug/gzo2eb5/,1622242144,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

We all know that the group most susceptible to bad information is also going to be impacted by headline-driven messaging. 

In fact, the strength and duration of naturally acquired immunity from recovered patients is what gave us confidence in the staying power of a robust, vaccine-induced immunity. At least, that's my perception based on reading information published by the NIH. 

At the moment the moment we don't know how long either lasts and we should refrain from hard stances thereof. 

&gt; Do you disagree that current studies/research shows that vaccine induced immunity gives a more robust response?

The current studies/research indicate that the vaccine-induced immunity works much better against known and emerging variants when looking at antibodies. 

However, when looking at T-cell responses, it's hard to say. In that light, responses seem to indicate staying power against variants in all cases.

So I think we would say, naturally acquired immunity provides protection, but for the sake of optimizing defense, previous infection or not, a two shot series of current mRNA vaccine remains the optimal decision. 

Even I am probably oversimplifying this somewhat. There are several immune system components in play here. What I'm saying is we should be careful in the messaging and stick to an accurate assessment as a whole. 

I don't want to be mislead, either, after all.

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32668444/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32668444/)

&gt;we showed that patients (n = 23) who recovered from SARS (the disease associated with SARS-CoV infection) possess long-lasting memory T cells that are reactive to the N protein of SARS-CoV 17 years after the outbreak of SARS in 2003;

Also note that SARS1 N-protein reactive T-cells also displayed a robust response to SARS2, demonstrating the N-protein is highly conserved (as opposed to the spike - S-Protein).

[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.614676/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.614676/full)

&gt;SARS-CoV-2 has homology to other alpha and beta ‘common cold’ endemic coronaviruses (eCoVs) in circulation, and cross-reactive T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins are present in a substantial percentage of unexposed individuals.

Now, reactivity (at least for viruses and not retroviruses) is sufficient to prevent severe disease as upon detection of the N-protein an immune response will cause the immune system to destroy and mop up infected cells even without the presence of neutralizing antibodies.

One potential issue is that the current vaccines only carry the S-protein, so if the spike changes too much then the vaccine won't work. There is work being done on whole cell inactivated vaccines, which would provide broad resistance to any possible mutation. However there is a risk that these won't give an individual who has already been vaccinated with an S-protein only vaccine the additional protection, at least whilst they have detectable S-protein antibodies as these will neutralise the inactivated virions.",,,1622149484,{},gzolpd5,False,t3_nlwyxv,False,True,t1_gzleai3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nlwyxv/mild_covid19_induces_lasting_antibody_protection/gzolpd5/,1622253256,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

One of the terms using ""monkey"" was to be Kirill Dmitriev .  
The message of the campaign was extremely direct - the photos showed a chimpanzee wearing a lab coat, monkeys coming out of an AstraZeneca tent, or even a photo of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson with the head of a chimpanzee.  
After the Times article, the action was condemned by the authorities of the University of Oxford, the director of AstraZeneca Pascal Soriot, scientists and politicians. Russia went stiff : “The suggestion that the Russian state may be carrying out any propaganda against the AstraZeneca vaccine is in itself an example of disinformation. This is, of course, to discredit Russia's efforts to fight the pandemic, including the good cooperation we have established with Great Britain in this area, ”a spokesman for the British Embassy in the UK told reporters.  
Who did the North Korean hackers sell the data to?  
The tension grew the closer the vaccines entered the market (this story is about the European market). December was the key - it was at the end of this month that AstraZeneca was approved for use in the UK and announced that it would apply for EU registration. It was known that preparations from Pfizer and Moderna would be approved earlier, but their vaccines were from the beginning quite expensive and difficult to store (requirement of very low temperatures). The much cheaper AZ and Sputnik V vector vaccines had a better chance of mass influencing the market. Scientists worked as fast as possible.  
Another disturbing piece of news appeared in the media on December 2: ""North Korean hackers attacked at least six pharmaceutical companies in the US, UK and South Korea dealing with Covid-19 vaccines,"" reported The Wall Street Journal . - “The regime is looking for confidential information to sell or use. (...) North Korea also tried to infiltrate the British company AstraZeneca PLC. (...) ""  
Hackers have been attacking since August, presumably hunting for data that they can then sell. We don't know if they stole anything or sold the data to someone and to whom. It is known, however, that the North Korean regime maintains friendly relations with the Kremlin. And that the second half of 2020, when the attacks took place, was the period when scientists received data on the results of clinical trials on preparations.  
Putin's satisfaction  
At this time, the action thickens. On December 11, the media reported that AstraZeneca decided to officially cooperate with the Russians - it was about testing whether the combination of Astra Zeneca and Russian Sputnik V would increase their effectiveness. This is a trial program, later it turns out that the British tested various preparations in this way, but the fact of cooperation was so important that it was reported by the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin himself . First at his annual international conference, and on December 21 at a special videoconference attended by himself, both our Russian heroes and Pascal Soriot, director of AstraZeneca. Everyone was happy about the agreement, and Soriot fondly recalled an earlier meeting in the Kremlin, one and a half years ago.  
Between the first and the second conference, Germany came to the fore again. On December 18, Health Minister Jens Spahn informed his Russian counterpart: ""Germany is ready to cooperate with Russia in the production of Russian vaccines against the coronavirus."" Russia replied : ""In the near future, Russian and German experts will conduct working talks to try to find production facilities for the joint production of Russian vaccines.""  
Vladimir Putin's satisfaction at the December 21 conference was clear. The future seemed clear: Sputnik V is about to conquer the European Union, Germany will produce it, the British have started official cooperation. The Russian vaccine is becoming a real vehicle for building political influence that forces Europe to look favorably on the eastern power.  
Russia celebrates cooperation, the network is silent  
It was this satisfaction that caused the campaign to discredit AstraZeneca on social media to suddenly stop. According to the research of social media conducted by the Alliance for Securing Democracy (analysis of tweets about vaccines from state and diplomatic accounts of Russia, China and Iran, in the period November 9, 2020 - February 9, 2021), in the Russian narrative about AstraZeneca "" there was a clear twist following the announcement in December of an agreement to test the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Sputnik V vaccine combinations. There was an increase in positive coverage and a decrease in negative coverage for AstraZeneca in the Russian diplomatic and state media. ""  
And further: “The state media and diplomatic communications about Oxford-AstraZeneca revealed the true symbiosis of Russia's interests with messages from the Russian state media and related accounts. (...) In October 2020, the British vaccine was seen as the main competitor of the Russian Sputnik V. ""  
The official partnership with Russia brought about an immediate change. ""The number of tweets mentioning the AstraZeneca vaccine have increased (...) and a significant number of them have celebrated the partnership, advertising it as a prime example of Russia's non-political approach to global health.""  
And then suddenly something went wrong. But this is a story for the second season of this series. Coming soon to OKO.press.",,,1622148905,{},gzokegb,True,t3_nmhc2v,False,True,t1_gzokdrz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nmhc2v/operation_aztrazeneca_down_how_russia_fought_for/gzokegb/,1622252509,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The second hero, 42-year-old Alexei Repik, was called a child prodigy in Russia. He was born in Moscow, where he also studied, and at the age of 16 he began his studies, paying for it on his own thanks to a job in a low position in a city hospital. He dealt with the procurement and distribution of drugs. In 2001, at the age of just over 20, he founded his own company, R-Pharm. Today it is one of the largest Russian pharmaceutical companies, thanks to, among other things, state contracts for the supply of Western drugs.  


  
Repik is currently a billionaire, his wife (a famous model and fashion blogger Polina Repik) and three children live in the United States. The oligarch has permanent contacts with the Kremlin, including 18 official meetings with President Putin. He performs several functions in Russian chambers and advisory bodies. He was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Federal Corporation for the Development of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises by Prime Minister Medvedev, since 2016 he has been a member of the Council for Strategic Development and National Projects at the President of the Russian Federation, and he is the public Ombudsman for Entrepreneurs appointed by the President of Russia. On March 20, 2020, Putin awarded the order ""For Merit for the Fatherland"".  


  
It just so happens that this oligarch also interested the American prosecutor Robert Mueller - Repik was one of six Russians present at Donald Trump's inaugural ball in January 2017. Apart from him, there were Russian lobbyists whose links with the Trump campaign were proven in the investigation, and lawyer Natalia Weselnicka, accused in 2019 by the US prosecutor 's office of ""conspiratorially conspiring with a high-ranking Russian prosecutor to provide false information to the US judiciary and influence its proceedings.""  


  
The two heroes of the American Russiangate, who have close contacts with President Putin, are today the main persons responsible for the production and sale of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine. Although they are not always in the foreground, it must be remembered that they are in the shadows.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
Cooperation with competitors or ...  
In the vaccine race, Western companies could count on contracts with the EU to sell vaccines, but not the Russians. They have known for a long time that entering the European market will be very difficult. However, it can be assumed that Putin wanted it very much - it would be proof of the strength of his state, Europe's dependence on Russia, expansion of cooperation with EU states, and recovery from economic and political isolation.  


  
Rationally, however, with the vaccine race underway, Sputnik V would have a chance to conquer Europe only if Europe had no other option. So if the competition failed. Or if we could work with her.

  
In September 2020, after Sputnik V was registered in Russia, the media reported that Russian R-Pharm was preparing to produce AstraZeneka - not in Russia, but at its factory in Germany. Here we move to the main action place.  


  
R-Pharm Germany is a subsidiary of the Russian R-Pharm Alexei Repik - a small pharmaceutical plant in the Bavarian city of Illertissen. Repik bought it in 2014 from Pfizer, until 2018 Pfizer's contracts were carried out there, then it had to deal with the market on its own. The vaccine production capacity has therefore dropped off the top of the plant - R-Pharm has announced that it will have to invest EUR 20 million in the plant, but thanks to this, from the first quarter of 2021 it will be possible to produce up to 500 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines annually.  


  
""Monkey vaccine""  
Everything seemed to be beautifully arranged. But in mid-October another British news came out - journalists from The Times identified a Russian disinformation campaign aimed at spreading fear of the AstraZeneca vaccine (which was still at the clinical trial stage at the time).  


  
""Photos, memes and video clips depicting a vaccine made in the UK as dangerous originated in Russia, and intermediaries are now trying to"" spread ""the material on social networks around the world,"" wrote The Times. “The main motive is that the vaccine, millions of doses of which will be produced by the pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, could turn humans into monkeys because it uses the chimpanzee virus as a vector. The campaign is aimed at countries where Russia wants to sell its own Sputnik V vaccine, as well as to Western countries.

This is indicated by numerous circumstantial evidence and analyzes of the activity of sources in the network (though not hard evidence). The main site of the Russian action was probably Germany. It was here that the fight for influence in the European Union and money from the EU market took place.  


  
In Poland, as well as in other countries, many people do not want to vaccinate themselves with the preparation of the British company AstraZeneca. As recently reported by Gazeta Wyborcza , out of 3.5 million doses of AZ that have already reached Poland, another million are waiting for volunteers, but vaccination centers order them less and less, because patients do not want to take them.  


  
They are concerned about serious side effects, especially blood clots. They also have doubts as to whether the preparation is effective at all. Despite the very careful checking of the safety of the preparation and the assurances of the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency, the distrust towards AstraZeneka is huge.  


  
There is no doubt - this is the result of months of information chaos about this preparation, decisions of several countries to suspend vaccination with it (decisions were later withdrawn) and disinformation conducted in the network.  


  
Where did this chaos come from? Who was behind him, what was the real situation we experienced the hard way? Our two texts are about this.  


  
The first one you are reading now reconstructs the events before the massive vaccination campaign began. It is a story about Russian disinformation, hackers attacking a British laboratory, young oligarchs behind the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, which competes with AstraZeneka, and the involvement of Vladimir Putin himself.  


  
The second part - which we will publish soon - is a picture of the great international clashes on the vaccine market - over influence, power and money. Who and why caused us, ordinary people, such a strong fear of AstraZeneca? What did he need it for? And is it really over now?  


  
ASTRAZENECA DOWN.  


  
It's almost like a series - a medical-political thriller written for episodes with numerous twists, in which the highest stakes are saving humanity from the virus, and on the other hand - gaining power and money. Events took place at the top of the government, among influential politicians and businessmen, scientists and journalists.  


  
The first season of the series ended in December 2020 with a spectacular conference between President Vladimir Putin and the head of AstraZeneca, Pascal Soriot. But the most spectacular actions were kept for season two, which started in 2021. Everything like in the series - only it really happened.  


  


  
Season One: Russians and Monkey Injection  
It's summer 2020. The whole world is fighting the coronavirus pandemic. Scientists in dozens of laboratories are looking for an effective vaccine against COVID-19. In Great Britain, the preparation developed by scientists from the University of Oxford seems to be the most promising.  


  
In Russia, experts from the state-owned Gamalei Institute are working on the vaccine. Their preparation is based on a similar technology as the British preparation - they are the so-called vector vaccines. There is a race against time - it is not only about the health of people decimated by the virus, but also about taking the best starting position: who will be first, who will offer an effective, cheap, easy-to-store preparation and will guarantee income from a large part of the international market.

  
The scientists' work is kept secret. Suddenly a scandal breaks out. On July 16, British authorities report: Russian hackers tried to steal the data. The British National Cyber ​​Security Center announcement shows that the well-known Russian hacker group APT29 (aka ""Cozy Bear""), long classified by the services of various countries as related to the Russian intelligence services, attacked entities involved in the development of the COVID vaccine throughout 2020. 19 in the world, incl. in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, ""most likely with intent to steal information and intellectual property related to the development and testing of COVID-19 vaccines.""  


  
The NCSC informed the British Prime Minister that it had evidence that the Kremlin was behind the attempted data theft, and that the Russian president Vladimir Putin himself was to know about the attacks. A goal in the UK There were to be two centers in Britain: Oxford University and Imperial College London. It has not been revealed whether the attempted data theft was successful.  


  
The very next day, July 17, the Russians are responding to the British accusations. The main characters enter the stage. First, Kiriłł Dmitriev, president of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which finances work on the Russian Sputnik V vaccine. - says the Reuters agency Dmitriev. - “There's nothing to steal. Everything will be handed over to Russia. ""  


  
The second hero, usually in the shadows, is the owner of the Russian pharmaceutical concern R-Pharm, Alexey Repik. He confirms that on July 17, his company signed the contract that Dmitriev talks about. Interestingly, the British company AstraZeneca declined to comment. She is silent.

  


&amp;#x200B;

  
Young Russian oligarch and ties to Trump  
Let's take a look at the heroes. They are both new Russian oligarchs, from the 40-year-old generation, well-versed in the Western world. Kirill Dmitriev, 46, is the husband of Natalia Popova, a close friend of Vladimir Putin's daughter, Katerina Tikhonova. He has frequent and direct contacts with Putin. He was born in Kiev, but at the age of 14, his parents sent him to California. He studied at Stanford University, then at Harvard Business School. He worked in the largest American banks and consulting companies (Goldman Sachs, McKinsey &amp; Company). Since 2011, he has been managing the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), established by the Russian government.  


  
However, as reported by the New York Times , in November 2016, Dmitriev was involved in something other than economic investment. During the presidential campaign in the US, he began looking for contact with someone from Donald Trump's close circle. It was the meetings with Trump's staff members that made Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller interested in Dmitriev in 2019 in the Russiangate investigation into the Kremlin's influence on the Trump campaign.

  
We know from his report that Dmitriev managed to get in touch with Rick Gerson, a friend of Jared Kushner, D. Trump's son-in-law. Together, they were to work on a ""reconciliation plan"" between Russia and the US (on Putin's orders). The document was then sent to Trump's trusted people: Jared Kushner, Rex W. Tillerson (US Secretary of State in 2017-2018) and Steve Bannon (head of the election campaign, later Trump's advisor).

We don’t know what level of titer makes someone “safe” or how quickly it degrades for each individual. So the reason vaccines are good is that they create a uniform, measurable response, which has been studied to be whatever % effective (depending on the vaccine).

At the same time, our basic understanding of humoral immunity is that any moderate infection that produces symptoms will create *some degree* of adaptive immunity (the memory cells that tell your body how to fight in the future). These cells are harder to measure than antibodies, so we’ve gotten into this habit of using the antibody titer as a surrogate for immunity. But it’s not that simple.

You could measure antibodies in someone who had an asymptomatic case one month ago, then test them again in two months and the antibodies are gone. Or you could test a recovered patient and find *zero* antibodies because too much time has passed, but they have a ton of T cells hanging out in the bone marrow ready to go.

This variability is why it’s better and easy to just tell everyone to get vaxxed.

It was painfully obvious for anyone who has dealt with early childhood education and development, even in the slightest (and literally most of what I've gathered was from my grandfather who was a professor of early childhood education for 30 years, so its not that much).

The damage we have done to children in the last year will far outlast anything the virus has caused to other people. Missing or delaying a year of development for certain age groups can be absolutely catastrophic for their later chances of success.

Not only that but it gets worse across the income divide, which is now a gaping chasm we are just starting to grasp. Kids who could afford to have a parent at home, who could afford good internet, who had decent computers all did better than those that couldn't. In-class schooling is a great equalizer (in theory) and we threw any chance of that out the window a year ago. Minority and disadvantaged students are absolutely worse off now.

And lastly, beyond just education, the emotional development through peer interaction, especially in the K-3 group is basically life setting. It's scary to acknowledge, but _so_ much critical emotional intelligence is gained in those years through interactions with other children, things like empathy and compassion, that missing out on it like this could mean a massive problem in the next 10-15 years as they reach adulthood.

And it boggles my mind that we didn't send kids back in the fall of 2020. The risks of COVID compared to the risks to children from lacking education and interaction were _extremely_ well established. But we sat in the US and we watched a frenzy of panic and misinformation dictate over science.

For the former, the calculation would be Ve=(Cp-Cv)/Cp where Ve=vaccine efficacy, Cp=cases from placebo cohort and Cv=cases from vaccinated cohort. So, taking from Modernas data (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577) we get  (185-11)/185=0.94 or 94%. Essentially, this number is factoring in a negative control population in order to address factors that cannot be addressed by simple observation such as disease prevalence or non pharmaceutical mitigation efforts like behavior modification. Also notable is the fact that the endpoint for this study was symptomatic disease, not a positive test. 

The latter is simply Cv/Pv where Cv is all reported cases in vaccinated people and Pv is the number of people vaccinated. That would be 10,262/101,000,000=0.0001 or 0.01%. The endpoint here is reported cases, which could lead to an overestimating of effectiveness because vaccinated individuals have much less incentive to get tested and thus we are probably missing breakthrough cases. 

This is not to disparage the vaccines at all, it is truly an incredible scientific achievement; had you told me a vaccine with 95% efficacy would be developed and deployed in under a year at this time in 2020, I would have thought you were being ridiculous.

It seems to me like they decided that the vaccine ended the pandemic. Now that anyone 12+ can get fully vaccinated our work is done here. If you don't want to get vaccinated, that's you'r problem. Most of those who want to be protected are. Kids under 12 hardly every die from Covid. Life is back to normal. The end.

I agree with you. Long haulers and Covid related organ damage are a huge issue (lots of people going on disability/going bankrupt/unable to function/hospitalized/need surgery or medical treatment, which is bad for everyone). My understanding is that until now scientists didn't know whether vaccinated people could get long hauler, but based on this article it seems like they can. Transmission is also a major issue, because it means more infections, long haulers and variants (potentially more vaccine resistant/deadly/infectious variants that could potentially affect vaccinated people too).

[],,Jacc3,,,[],,,,text,t2_d3u0b,False,False,[],"Actually I checked the numbers from the [official ECDC statistics](https://vaccinetracker.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/vaccine-tracker.html#distribution-tab). They showed that 83% of all delivered AstraZeneca doses have been used, with the numbers being 79% for Moderna and 93% for Pfizer/BioNTech. One thing to keep in mind here as well is that some places are able to extract 7 doses per Pfizer/BioNTech vial (but is only counted as 6 doses when delivered), which could be one reason for the higher percentage there.

[My spreadsheet for reference](https://ufile.io/womdh5zk) in case you want to double check the numbers. I excluded the countries where eithers numbers were missing or where the vaccine has been taken out of the vaccination program (i.e. Norway and Denmark).

---

&gt; Of course, I have no doubt that there is demand. Some countries have now allowed people to skip the line and take AZ because of the low uptake. But, why is that nessesary if they don't have a stockpile not getting used?

If given the choice between ""Pfizer/BioNTech now or AstraZeneca now"" the vast majority would choose Pfizer/BioNTech because it has a higher efficacy, there is a shorter dose interval (you will be fully vaccinated sooner) and no risk of blood clots (even if it is very low with AZ).

But this is **not** the same thing as the vaccine not being used. Germany is a prime example of this, where many choose to take the vaccine just because it lets them cut the line, and there is a much higher demand than supply for this group. It means that all the doses *are* being used.

&gt; EU is also donating lots of the AZ as their own citizens aren't as willing to take it. Which is great for the world, don't get me wrong. That's a good thing, but AZ's rep has been trashed in the EU.

The EU hasn't really started donating yet. Sweden has donated some since it is not given to those below 65 and those above 65 are now vaccinated (although there would certainly be many below that age who would take the vaccine if they only had the ability to), but other than that I don't know of any other cases. But even then, what does it matter? The fact that EU starts donating doses once domestic demand is met is just one extra reason why the EU should receive its doses on time, because it would mean that *both the EU and the rest of world* would receive more doses. The problem is that AstraZeneca has been behind on production world-wide.

 &gt; Vaccine hesitancy is already quite high, not as high as the US, but still.

Maybe in some places in the EU, but in other places like the Nordics and Germany for example approximately 90% wants to get vaccinated.

&gt; but for example the pill is much, much more likely to give you a blood clot.

I don't understand why this comparison is still being made. The pill gives you a different kind of blood clot which is not as serious and is easier to treat. The problem with AstraZeneca (and J&amp;J) is that even if it is extremely rare, it can cause a combination of blood clots and low platelets which is more serious and deadly, and the same treatment also cannot be used.

The two types of blood clots aren't really comparable as the severity differs greatly.",,,1622119173,{},gzmomsp,False,t3_nlevct,False,True,t1_gzmlclt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nlevct/eu_seeks_huge_fine_for_astrazeneca_vaccine_delays/gzmomsp/,1622211136,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Great news! The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has clearly proven its effectiveness around the world even in the face of variants of concern. The companies themselves have done well to fulfill their commitments. Definitely a good decision for the Malaysian government to order more of this vaccine.

Pfizer has delivered to Malaysia a total of 2.75 million doses as of this week since the first shipment in February. Another 2.22 million doses will be delivered throughout June. 25.68 million more doses will be received throughout the third quarter of this year (~2 million per week!). The whole order of 44.8 million doses will arrive by the end of 2021.

Besides that, Malaysia's entire order of 12 million Sinovac vaccines will be fully fulfilled by the end of July. AstraZeneca meanwhile is expected to deliver 610,000 doses in June and 410,000 doses in July. Malaysia has ordered 6.4 million doses from AstraZeneca.

Since Malaysia began vaccinating in late February, the vaccination rate remained slow and stagnant throughout March and April with supply being the bottleneck. The government has continually insisted that the rate will increase as more and more supplies come in. Indeed the pace has increased this month, with a peak of 99,552 doses in a day on Tuesday, May 25. With these impending shipments from various manufacturers, the government has set a target of vaccinating 150,000 doses a day by June. All of this in order to reach the target of vaccinating 80% of the adult population by the end of this year.

The real issue is that it's wildly variable. If you had asymptomatic infection then it makes sense that your body did not mount an adaptive immune response, because it did not have to.

If you had a ""real"" infection (mild, moderate, or severe) with symptoms and recovery, then you have some immunity. This happens with *every infectious disease*. Scientists are just cautious by nature, and they don't like to make claims until they can be backed by observation.

The more time passes the more they will measure protective immunity in recovered patients, and the longer that ""predicted immunity"" will get. People who recovered from SARS 1 still had active T cells 17 years later.

The reason we need a new flu vaccine every year is because viruses can mutate. If it mutates enough then the body no longer recognises the virus and won't initiate the immune response. So the body becomes susceptible to infection by the new strain.

So flu vaccines use either a live form of the flu virus itself which has been weakened so that it doesn't cause harm.
Or 
A form of the virus which has been killed so then it can't cause harm.


But both these live and killed virus vaccines contain whole viral particles in the vaccine itself. Now we have learned that we don't actually need a whole viral particle to induce immune response. Viruses have proteins on their surface and these proteins themselves are generally enough to initiate immune response. You may have heard of H1N1, H3N2 flu viruses. The ""H"" and ""N"" and the different numbers actually refer to different types of surface proteins.


mRNA vaccines code for these proteins themselves. And because we can create exact mRNA sequences, this means we can actually design the exact surface protein we want to generate the response. The mRNA is introduce into the system and then your own cells make the viral surface proteins ONLY and none of the other parts of the virus, and these proteins on their own can't do any harm.",,,1622066724,{},gzkfxrw,False,t3_nljoie,False,False,t1_gzk8jof,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nljoie/covid19_infections_are_exceedingly_rare_after/gzkfxrw/,1622165065,30,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I think the big thing that unsettles me was all the pride in complaining about how parents wished their kids weren't at home? Just sort of spouting off to anyone who was in earshot, and complaining about having to do schooling with them? Even if the parent doesn't outright blame the kid themselves, the kid is most likely going to internalize it, and maybe even self blame.

I'm so sorry you were treated as a nuisance as a child, no one deserves to go through that, but I'm glad you've used it be more understanding with your own kids.

* Wash my produce before putting it away (as apposed to doing it just before cooking).
* Wash my hand after being in public spaces when I get home. I'll add on ""stop touching my face"" as something she would chew me out for doing when I was a kid but after all this the reason why is a little more in my face. Pun maybe intended. 
* Wear a mask at the very least when I'm sick and have to be in public (and around the vulnerable if needed). My grandmother was a nurse and worked abroad in Asia. I don't know if she picked up the mask wearing in Asia or from treating tuberculosis patients but after a year of wearing masks I don't feel inconvenienced by them. I could also see wearing one when I attend a concert or things that'll bring a lot of people from outside a community/across the country. People have been trying to avoid the [Con Crud](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/con_crud) for decades. I'll probably be keeping my extra masks in my glove compartment along with the first aid kit.  
* Check CDC and local health organizations announcements on outbreaks (and similar things) so I can take meaningful precautions. This is were I'll make decisions if I should change my behaviors in public like keeping my distance from others, when I shouldn't visit large cities Chicago or New York if I don't have need for it, and similar things like. Granted my grandmother didn't tell me to do this one but it was something I saw that she did once it became available online.
* Get the flu shot. I never bothered because I never noticeably got sic but for all I know I could be the flu's equivalent of Typhoid Mary. After seeing everyone repeat the statistic of how many people die from the flu each year (repeatedly) it seems disappointingly high. I also work with a lot of older people and I need to do right by.

For the short term I'm waiting to see happens after July 4th before I start going back to stores for recreation and similar leisure activities. The way things are going I'm assuming nothing will happen but that's being the next big culture gathering holiday it will the most reasonable of our efforts. Like I said I haven't been inconvenienced by not spending disposable income in public spaces so I have no issue waiting.

A moderate infection that triggers an adaptive immune response will give someone long-lasting *protective* immunity - meaning that if they are re-exposed to the virus, they will regenerate antibodies and likely fight it off again without any issues. But there will still be a time period where they are infected, have some symptoms, and can spread to others.

Vaccines create *sterilizing* immunity, which means you already have a very high titer of circulating antibodies, and the virus never gets a chance to take hold at all.

In the interest of getting the pandemic under control, sterilizing immunity is better. But that doesn’t mean that protective immunity does not exist or have any effect. It’s not all or nothing.

If you were infected and symptomatic, then it is *very likely* that you now have T cells that confer immunity, and it is *very likely* those cells will stick around for years. If you were infected and asymptomatic, it’s possible that your adaptive immunity was never engaged, so you will not have immunity.

Because 57% received Sinopharm and 43% received AZ, I think we need more detailed data to see whether 2 vaccines are performing differently. Also article talked about the possibility of the variant first identified in South Africa arriving there, I think AZ's trial results shows 10.4% efficacity against that variant and SA government had to halt the rollout of AZ there.

One more point, only my personal opinion, I find the covid cases graph in the article kind of odd. The new case number has been hovering around 30 and 110 from Feb to early May. I would expect a skyrocketing of cases, a peak, and the downward trend because of lockdown, stay at home, or vaccine rollout. Most countries graphs look like that. Could it be a limitation of testing capacity at the beginning? I think quite some African countries don't have many new covid cases because they have very limited covid testing capacity.

Chile is a very interesting case, it peaked at April and had a downward trend until early May and slightly going up again. I personally can't figure out why. First I want to point out that they are using Sinovac, not Sinopharm. Sinovac supposed to have 67% efficacity in Chile, slightly lower than Sinopharm's. But tbh I'd expect a better result there. It will be very helpful if any Chilean can shine lights here. Is there any festival, lockdown rule change, or mask rule change?

I think you can look at the situation at Serbia to assess Sinopharm's real world effect. Serbia signed contracts with almost all major vaccine manufacturers and it has one of the highest vaccination rate in Europe. But because Sinopharm delivered all contracted does (millions) and other manufacturers haven't delivered much, 70% vaccinations there used Sinopharm. The number of new cases decreased from 5000+ peak in March to \~400 yesterday. The downward trend is very evident. If the situation in Serbia changes, I will worry more about Sinopharm's real world effect. Of course I hope that will not happen.",,,1622147897,{},gzoi4ez,False,t3_nm81td,False,False,t1_gznp7mr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nm81td/study_sinopharm_covid19_vaccines_appear_safe/gzoi4ez/,1622251204,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

1.- The government had a national health survey that included collecting samples to check for antibodies from Sep-Oct 2020, results were published in November showed more than 25% of the population had antibodies. This was prior to the huge wave in the winter.

2.- The huge surge last winter, we went through hell, oxygen scarcity, a lot of hospitals didn't have any beds, the 90% capacity meant there was probably a bed somewhere in a small town but it was hard to find hospital care for patients.

3.- Vaccination, while slow, I believe (except for private medical personnel) the govenment took the best approach for groups which is strictly age based, like the in the UK, so addressing everyone over 60 as a priority really shows on the decline of deaths since population over 60 made up 80% of hospitalizations.

Also, a lot of people believe this is a campaign thing because we have elections next week, but trully it is not, some Universities estimate that 60% of the population might have already been exposed.

[],,superkp,,,[],,,,text,t2_57t3h,False,False,[],"TL;DR I did some math a while back and these days in a low cost of living area you want closer to 3 million for basic ""good life but not golden toilets"" lifestyle.

Yeah I did the numbers on it a while ago. In order to get the ""set for life, go ahead and retire"" you want so much that you can live your expected lifestyle off of the *interest* you get from just letting the money site somewhere - usually 3-4% is considered safe.

For me, I make $60k/year roughly. 60k is 4% of 1.5 million.

And that has to be the *after tax* amount that you receive. So if you're taxed 40%, then your prize needs to be $2.5 million.

So, if I, in my low cost of living area, want to continue my life exactly as before but simply not working (i.e. the same house payment, same groceries, etc, etc.) then I would need to win 2.5 million.

Personally, I think that if I got a 2.5 million prize, I'd continue working until all my debts are paid off - which you don't always want to do in a lump sum (for example, my mortgage rate is like 2.9% or something, so if the investing returns of 3-4% hold true, then it's more profitable to make minimum payments). After that, get myself to a point where I can make double my current yearly salary (so get the 'nest egg' up to 3 million) *and then* retire.

I think If I got the 2.5 million payout it wouldn't take that long to get my after-tax up to $3million.

Obviously, if you're in a high cost of living area, you'd want to increase all the values here proportionally.",,,1622127307,{},gzn5pa3,False,t3_nm4h2u,False,True,t1_gzmxn8l,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nm4h2u/ohio_announces_winner_of_first_vaccination_lottery/gzn5pa3/,1622221982,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; Among 43,044 antibody-positive persons who were followed for a median of 16.3 weeks (range: 0–34.6), 314 individuals (0.7%) had at least one PCR positive swab ≥14 days after the first-positive antibody test. Of these individuals, 129 (41.1%) had supporting epidemiological evidence for reinfection. Reinfection was next investigated using viral genome sequencing. Applying the viral-genome-sequencing confirmation rate, the incidence rate of reinfection was estimated at 0.66 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 0.56–0.78). Incidence rate of reinfection versus month of follow-up did not show any evidence of waning of immunity for over seven months of follow-up. Meanwhile, in the complement cohort of 149,923 antibody-negative persons followed for a median of 17.0 weeks (range: 0–45.6), incidence rate of infection was estimated at 13.69 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 13.22–14.14). Efficacy of natural infection against reinfection was estimated at 95.2% (95% CI: 94.1–96.0%). Reinfections were less severe than primary infections.

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

&gt;a hypothesized cognitive bias wherein people may perceive the world to be more dangerous than it actually is, due to long-term moderate to heavy exposure to violence-related content on mass media.

&gt;Proponents of the syndrome—which was coined by communications professor George Gerbner in the 1970s—assert that viewers who are exposed to violence-related content can experience increased fear, anxiety, pessimism and heightened state of alert in response to perceived threats. This is because media (namely television) consumed by viewers has the power to directly influence and inform their attitudes, beliefs and opinions about the world.

If you get invited and you choose not to come, you have to get back in line and you will get vaccinated later.

All I asked was: Should I wait if I can get Janssen to get Pfizer instead because it seems to be Pfizer is more effective (compare 94 to 67).

And you now mention that you downvoted because you found it me being entitled. I think you made a assumption there. Why wouldn’t somebody consider waiting if in their mind one or the other will do more good for them and the people around them?

https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-reddit-covid-misinformation-moderators

&gt;Science News spoke to three of these moderators about what it’s like to combat misinformation online during a pandemic. Head moderator Patrick Doherty is a biotech research scientist; Jennifer Cole is a biological anthropologist at Royal Holloway University of London, who studies online communities related to health and became an infodemic manager, after receiving training from a World Health Organization initiative to fight misinformation; and Rohan — who requested not to use his full name due to the daily harassment he receives on Reddit — is a M.D./Ph.D. student in molecular biology.

In other words, some or all of the mods on this sub have direct connections to the virology research field.  Therefore, it could reasonably be questioned whether they have biases in favor of crushing discussion of the lab leak hypothesis.

I'm not saying they do, or that they all have an equal stake in that research funding even if some do.  But, in the interests of transparency, it would be a good idea for the people who have been quashing discussion of this topic to come forward and state their interests, if any.

That’s kind of a separate thing from scientists who get down to the nitty gritty of how immunity works, how long an individual adaptive response might last, etc. It’s cool to know, for example, that they found active T cells in recovered SARS 1 patients *17 years* after infection [[source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z)], or that they recently found strong T cells in the bone marrow of people who had recovered form mild COVID19 [[source](https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/immune-system-has-long-term-defenses-after-mild-covid-19-children-may-be-key-2021-05-24/)].

Ontario (Canada) was allowing AZ for those aged 50-60 and later 40-60, while those 60+ were getting Pfizer and Moderna. Then, because of three simultaneous factors 1) the *rate* of Canadians (specifically women between 30 and 50) getting and dying from AZ-related blood clots rose, 2) the number of new daily COVID cases across the province was dropping rapidly, and 3) imported shipments of Pfizer and Moderna went way up... the government decided the first week of May that use of AZ as the first dose was no longer justified.

Supplies of Pfizer and Moderna were high enough that just one week after the AZ-halt order was issued, anyone 40+ could book an appointment for Pfizer or Moderna, then a week after that anyone 18+ could book one (to be fair, appointments were for weeks into the future).

So absolutely yes, if Australia mainly has AZ right now, their *currently* low case counts *might* not justify use of AZ, if they can get a hold of Pfizer or Moderna in large quantities soon.

No they fucked up the dosage, because of a measurement error they did it in Oxford leading them to overestimate the concentration, the original measurement by the Italian plant was correct. They only figured it out once the participants had fewer side effects than expected. Then they kinda tried to mislead the public that it was intentional.

&gt;The documents published in The Lancet confirm that the error lay with the Oxford researchers. A common emulsifier, polysorbate 80, used in vaccines to facilitate mixing, had interfered with the ultraviolet-light meter that measures the quantity of viral material, according to the documents. As a result, the vaccine’s viral concentration was overstated and Oxford ended up administering half doses of vaccine, believing they were full doses.

COVID is unmitigated, sure, but for kids *it's just not that dangerous to start with*. All those other things that have been mitigated started out really, really dangerous and have become less dangerous as we've introduced those mitigations, and I'm glad that they did.

I still think that vaccination and/or herd immunity in the wider population are good things that will reduce risk: but this study shows that the risk to small children is so low to start with that, once the vulnerable adults around them are protected, it's just not worth worrying about.

You're right that there is more to be done; but equally, the long-term sequelae for COVID in children who have been infected just aren't there in numbers greater than for any other endemic virus.

If chosen at random, children are about 10-20× more likely to die of COVID than they are of a bee sting. COVID deaths skew hugely toward older children with pre-existing conditions; I don't have the data for bee stings by age but I'm still willing to bet that you aren't waiting for epidemiological studies to confirm whether your child is safe from the unmitigated risk of bees.

It other words... is this because it’s more transmissible? Or the virus itself is more deadly? 

I thought the rule of thumb for viruses was that they become more transmissible but less lethal the more and more they mutate. Would a lab leaked altered genome of the virus complicate these things? If you find out please let me know. 

But once again I’m not a virologist, geneticist or immunologist. Finding a non partisan expert in these fields is probaly the worst part especially for people who over think things. Just reading the same facts and studies you are. That study was published and released in March. I wonder is the mortality rate has changed since then? 

If you want me to say go get your vaccine. Sure do it! I got mine during the beginning of the third wave here in Ontario Canada. I work private avaition and was deemed essential due to patient and organ transfer contracts. Even had two weeks of covid patient transfers that a bunch of workers opted of due to fear. But I can’t help but question everything... and even myself... I’m still waiting on my second shot from Pfizer... but I always find myself with more questions than answers. It’s been the most confusing, confounding experience of my entire life. I guess you and I will just have to wait and see. 

My main focus here was trying to empower people to make smart choices regarding their nutrition and lifestyle. 

I feel once a historians route firmly addresses everything covid related... I can’t help but think the poorest, unhealthiest working classes will be hit the hardest... I had to work through out the pandemic... and the hypocrisy and different attitudes you come in contact with regarding the virus is interesting to say the least... especially from the working classes who had to risk it everyday to live paycheck to paycheck. But once again this is just me thinking about my personal experience. 

There has to be a correlation with obesity, environmental factors and malnutrition that made the death toll what it is... and that’s a systemic problem within our western culture... which firmly placed me into the conspiracy theory camp amongst some people...

Does it refer to hampering community spread somewhat by introducing moderately lower odds of transmission? I don't think there will be any clear way of measuring whether a bad spike would or wouldn't have been worse without masks, if you try to compare regions or states with and without mandates you'll bump into too many confounding factors (climate, prior immunity, other behavioral differences, economic differences, etc). But I expect that the common sense view of ""they make the bad thing somewhat less bad"" will hold.

Some people defined ""masks help"" literally as ""this pandemic would go to zero if we could just mask harder"".
