The key word here is **IF** the vaccine receives marketing authorization in China, Fosun Pharma will exclusively commercialize the vaccine in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau Special Administration Regions and in Taiwan.

Delta variant seems to reduce the efficacy of vaccines somewhat. Vaccines appear to still work well generally speaking, but certain situations may result in increase risk of getting COVID while even vaccinated (only getting the 1st dose in a 2-dose vaccine series, old age, weaken immune systems, length of time since vaccination).

Here is a summary of the recent research on the Delta Variant: https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1400584977012584451

I think the take away is that vaccines work, but the longer we let pockets of COVID spread unchecked in other countries, the more risk we have of getting a variant that isn't stopped by our vaccines.

Simply put HIPAA just makes sure you consent and have knowledge about what happens with your information. What would protect you from your employer is either the Civil Rights Act, Unions (and the Norris-LaGuardia Act), National Labor Relations Act (and it's subsequent acts), OSHA, and a few others. 

An employer is allowed to ask you for any medical information they deem fitting (unless previously agreed upon through negotiations). HIPAA prevents them from asking your provider (well, it prevents your provider from telling them anything). It is up to you, and the courts, to prove that what they do with that information has broken one of the aforementioned laws. Which regarding covid, it simply does not. 

The only valuable arguments one may have against getting the shot are; medical condition preventing them from doing so (which they would then be protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act), religious objection (protected under first amendment) or, and this one will require case law to support, one believes their constitutional right to Life is jeopardize by requiring an EUA drug to be administered in order to find employment.

&gt;Troll accounts that had attempted to influence the US election had also been tweeting about vaccines, a study says.  
Many posted both pro- and anti-vaccination messages to create ""false equivalency"", the study found.  
It examined thousands of tweets sent between 2014 and 2017.  
Vaccination was being used by trolls and sophisticated bots as a ""wedge issue"", said Mark Dredze from Johns Hopkins University.  
""By playing both sides, they erode public trust in vaccination, exposing us all to the risk of infectious diseases,"" he said.  
Earlier this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) said cases of measles in Europe had hit a record high, with experts blaming this surge in infections on a drop in the number of people being vaccinated.",,,1623161105,{},h112wc0,False,t3_nv1q1u,False,False,t1_h10vrz7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nv1q1u/antivaccine_film_targeted_to_black_americans/h112wc0/,1623332878,50,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This is mostly due to politicians being clueless (that's what you have experts for) and the general consensus of the experts/scientists in the country deemed it not effective enough, especially the ones that had great access to our politicians (our Fauci). Until that changed with overwhelming evidence it was effective over the course of the pandemic (after summer 2020). But then there was another problem: such a measure would be illegal if the country is not in a state of emergency (who has never declared). So they had to pass a specific corona law through parliament and the Senate allowing such measures. That took a while, and thus the mandate only went into effect on December 1st, before it was just an advice.

And what I think the objective is, is trying to release all measures, except for the basic measures (like distancing and masks) at the end of this month, because cases, hospitalisations and deaths are quickly dropping. So the risk for everyone will be low. And when everyone's had the chance to get fully vaccinated (doesn't matter if it's &gt;18, &gt;12 or &gt;5, it is all more or less the same time frame), somewhere the coming 2 to 3 months, all measures will be let go. 

Also, masking rules are already not the most strict here. Almost nobody wears a mask outside. Smaller children (&lt;12/13 I think) never have to wear masks not socially distance, even inside (so basically primary schools with no measures) and when inside a public building you only need to wear a mask while moving around, but not when seated.",,,1623144960,{},h10hc4c,False,t3_nrnc4j,False,True,t1_h10g1x1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nrnc4j/uk_drops_portugal_from_safe_travel_list_in_major/h10hc4c/,1623318110,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

To my mind, it seems prudent to end mask requirements once any adult who wants a vaccine can get one. After that, given the disease's less serious nature for children, I think the best approach is personal choice. If you decline the vaccine, and you contract COVID, you've made your choice.

Of course it's not a perfectly individual choice. No one lives in a bubble and even with a vaccine, one person's carelessness might affect others. But we need a roadmap for returning to normal and cases may never reach zero. Additionally, there's some evidence that CDC guidance saying vaccinated people don't need to wear a mask is itself causing reluctant people to get vaccinated. And that's good news.

I suspect once most of Europe reaches over 50% vax rates, which it will very soon, it will behave similarly.

The point of science is to make advancements, which involves theories, testing of those theories, and refinements to the testing and the theories. Science constantly corrects itself. In many ways, that is the essence of science. Science is not a belief, it’s a method of advancement. 

It’s no surprise that medical scientists have been wrong about things. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t correcting those wrongs. Surgeons didn’t know the value of extreme sanitization, for example, until theories about it were born and then tested. The medical field is *constantly* advancing. 

It may be that the FDA approved things that are no longer good, but they will eventually remove those approvals. Perhaps they could do it faster, but some might disapprove for a host of reasons not limited to economics and many other factors. 

We will always be learning more about the human body and how it works. That is the reason we have found cures to many of humans’ ailments, including Polio, Tuberculosis, and many other diseases. To say that the medicine community doesn’t know the human body because they haven’t solved cancer doesn’t ultimately take us very far. 

Have you read up on how the mRNA technology works? Scientists, through their theories and experiments, are suggesting that it is a safer and more robust method for delivering vaccines. Check out this article:

https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/the-application-and-future-potential-of-mrna-vaccines/

Among many of the interesting parts in it is this about mRNA vaccines:
&gt;	The implications of mRNA technology are staggering. Several vaccine developers are studying this technology for deployment against rabies, influenza, Zika, HIV and cancer, as well as for veterinary purposes. Its potential utility is based upon its being a “platform technology” that can be developed and scaled rapidly.

Do you think that someone buying months ahead of time is equal to panic buying? I mean I understand that people did panic buy real bad but those people were scared and went for anything they could(somehow it ended up being toilet paper instead of food and water🤦‍♂️). I'm not condoning it but I can understand how people that don't think more than 5 hours ahead of time realized they needed to stock up. The sad part is most of those people don't think they need to be prepared for anything anymore and that was just a random never will happen again event.

  


&gt;The supply chain is far too brittle. Thanks Lean Manufacturing!

  


For sure. Not enough people realize this. But this is kind of what I'm saying though.. people blamed others for panic buying but in the grand scheme of things it's the system that made these people complacent in a way that they don't think they need to worry because ""the system will never fail!""

Vaccines are required for a multitude of different things already, and that has been effective at practically eliminating those diseases in the US. What is the problem that we are trying to fix exactly?

I just went to an event this weekend that required either vaccinated status or a negative test within the last 48 hours.  They way they verified this? Simply by having a checkpoint where they asked us about it on our way in.  So people could lie.  I would like them to just be able to connect it to the tickets through a database or something like that. 

&gt;Some are required to travel to different countries, workplaces sometimes require them, schools require vaccines for attendance.

Yep. I've had to show proof of vaccination both at school and at a job. This was for things like meningitis and hepatitis vaccination.  So this is nothing new. 

&gt;A database/lookup system, on the surface at least, would be less disagreeable. The initial question that comes to my mind is ""Who has access, what information does it contain, and what information will it be expanded to contain?""

That is the case with any database.  I have Kaiser for my health care and insurance. They have a database for my health care info.  I can look it up online.  So again, this is nothing new. 

&gt;Once the vaccine has been around for a while, and has gotten full FDA approval, people will have less misgivings about it. Having a passport/database will be like the cookie warnings that pop up on every website.

One of my coworkers tore a ligament in their knee playing soccer after work and he has yet to be fired. We just moved his desk closer to the printer and he had to take some personal days for checkups and stuff. Just like most pregnant women would need. His condition will pass in about... 9 months. Which is actually longer than most pregnant women need accomidations for, based on the two women in my office who have been pregnant. It would be a much bigger pain in the ass to fire him (or those two women) and hire/train a new employee, honestly.

On the other hand, having a plague rat infect employees/clients and make the local news is way more damaging than a pregnant woman needing to get up and pee.

It's honestly going to be a screening question for me. If you cannot think critically enough to tell science from Facebook memes, or think about the big picture (aka herd immunity and protecting the vulnerable members of society) and your personal impact on it, I'll pass, thanks for applying.
 
Also, great job showing your ass with your trans bigotry nonsense. That was not pertinent to the conversation, but you managed it anyway.

As long as the skit is a tasteful length and they have a change of shoes/stay out of the shop (we have a dress code due to heavy machinery) why would I care? I'm not threatened. Are you?

HIPAA's Privacy Rule governs how personal health information is handled by medical service providers, insurers and others who might have access to private health information. There are some things that can be shared without the express written consent of the patient (i.e. the hospital and your insurance company can talk to each other to handle payment, but they have to try to share as little information as they can), but most other disclosures require the patient to sign off.

Effectively, you own your health information, so you mostly get to say what happens with it, even if someone else is storing it in their files for some legitimate reason. 

Asking someone (like a job applicant) whether they've been vaccinated isn't a HIPAA violation because the applicant can just say they don't want to answer; HIPAA says its your information, so you get to do what you want with it. They might not hire you, but not hiring you is not a violation of HIPAA in its own right because your information wasn't being disclosed without your knowledge.

Let's say the coronavirus enters you body. Your immune system detects that something weird is going on and sends a white blood cell to go check it out. That WBC brings a coronavirus to a lymph node where it is broken down into pieces. Those pieces will be examined by a dendritic cell and the dendritic cell will determine which antibody needs to be sent out to take care of the virus. It is important to note that a different antibody response will be chosen for each disease your body encounters. This is determined on a microbiological level by protein identification.

Basically, your immune system is smart enough to know which antibody to use for which disease response. There really wouldn't be a scenario where your body would say, ""Oh hey, meningitis.

Let’s, for arguments sake, assume that the pandemic originated from a laboratory-acquired infection. Pointing fingers or placing blame is not helpful. No laboratory is infallible in regard to accidents, especially those working with active bioagents like viruses. Laboratory spillover events have happened in the past. And they will continue to happen in the future. The question is, how can we reduce the risks?”

“Because of concerns about biosecurity, the types of microbes that research labs are working on are not shared with state and local health officials. In essence, health officials are in the dark when it comes to potential laboratory-acquired infections in their jurisdictions. This lack of awareness hinders public health preparedness efforts in cases of high-risk laboratory-acquired infections with potential to spread in the community.”

“Laboratory-acquired infections need to become notifiable diseases to local and state health departments. If ill, researchers and other laboratory workers must notify health care professionals that they work on bioagents in biomedical clinical or research facilities—and federal regulations should be changed to require such reporting. Healthcare professionals should notify local public health officials who would report to the state and ultimately to the CDC working in concert with the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. Similar surveillance systems should be established in all countries with biomedical clinical and research facilities.”

“The field of biomedical research ethics needs to be created. As with human subject research, Congress should establish a commission to identify doctrine underlying all biomedical research. The National Academies’ “Seven Experiments of Concern” should serve as a framework for the commission’s work.”

“We don’t know if gain-of-function research caused this pandemic or if it was naturally occurring. But the arguments for gain-of-function research can be countered by two points. First, the mRNA vaccines that were developed so quickly in response to the pandemic took decades of prior research and required the sequence of genetic material from the virus’s spike protein. Gain-of-function research was not needed. Second, investments in public health would improve response capabilities much more than any information that gain-of-function research could provide.”

What do you call someone who graduated at bottom of their nursing class? A nurse.

Also, just because you're a nurse doesn't mean you've been in the ICU, ER or have any experience with covid patients. You could be a colonoscopy nurse and your daily work is looking up someone's ass.

Being a nurse also doesn't mean you have any intelligence or common sense, sadly. Everyone knows someone who's book-smart but has no common sense. You were smart enough to pass NCLEX. 

And it could mean that they skipped the immunology lecture during anatomy and physiology or just have a very poor understanding of microbiology.

&gt;Are you asking what is the purpose of FDA approval as a whole or only as it relates to the Covid-19 vaccine?

I want to know the precedence for side effects of vaccines onset after 3 months. Because a lot of people want to talk about the potential risks of long tern side effects that I have yet to hear manifest beyond 3 months.


&gt;Would you tell your child to stand under a tree during a storm because getting struck by lightning ""almost never occurs""?

Alright, I'll rephrase. I hear people complaining about the possibility of side effects long term, but yet I see little reason to believe that side effects not captured during clinical trials will suddenly manifest themselves in 6-18 months out.


&gt;
""U.S. CDC and FDA are reviewing data involving six reported U.S. cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot in individuals after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine. In these cases,

As I understand it the FDA has already released recommendations for J&amp;J. If someone has an issue with the (as of 4/25 -&gt;) 28/8.7 million case rate, so be it, but the risks of clotting from COVID infection is larger than that. 

My point being that the cost benefit ratio of vaccine side effects at their current reported incidence rate is overshadowed by the hospitalizations and negative outcomes of unvaccinated covid cases. And the pending full approval does not erase the large amount of people vaccinated by Moderna, Pfizer, and j&amp;J that have no experienced a severe adverse event.

Anyone over age 12 who wants a shot, can get one, and easily. Pharmacies allow walk-ins. People with mobility issues can register on my turn and someone will go to their house to give them the shot. Uber gives free rides. Local governments give free rides. 

The vaccine is proven to protect against transmission, and if there is breakthrough infection the vaccine protects against severe illness and death. 

States that are fully open and don’t have mask requirements continue to have plummeting infection rates. Even New York dropped most requirements.

Unless countries with local HI close borders New Zealand style, which is obviously not desirable or practical, herd immunity through vaccination needs to be something the whole world is working on. Even with a globally coordinated effort it will take some countries much longer than others, and currently there is not really a fully globally coordinated effort. One of the central points of this article to me seems to be the idea that the approach to this has to be global, not just local. Right now it’s mostly local, which makes herd immunity in any given country super precarious. 

The problem with herd immunity being acquired through infection is unfortunately that that also increases the chances of breeding said variants. It’s in everyone’s best interests to try and control this through global vaccination, but we are nowhere near there yet. I am optimistic enough to think we’ll figure it out though.

Literally the only thing I said was that someone who had COVID and recovered has antibodies that studies suggest are about equally effective in preventing COVID as someone with the vaccine, so if someone who had COVID and recovered doesn't want to get vaccinated, no big deal, they're roughly the same risk of carrying and transmitting the virus as someone who has never had the virus but got vaccinated.

What you seem to be postulating is that, people who had COVID and recovered could give society ""extra"" protection by getting vaccinated.  Which is probably true, but I would argue that the ""extra"" protection is minimal (84% --&gt; 100% protection, at most, and it probably won't be 100% protection).  Whatever the case, it isn't worth stressing about forcing people with 84% protection against the virus *already* to get a vaccine on top of that.  That's just my opinion, feel free to disagree.

This does not follow- you can have done everything and still gotten it- nobody said that the guidelines were a guarantee, they just minimized risk but there are some things you need to do anyways, I live in a building and I need to take out the garbage- yes I distanced in the hallway and didn't share the elevator but that doesn't mean I can't have gotten it here. Same for laundry- with 3 kids laundry is a weekly chore nonnegotiable unless you have an absurd amount to spend on new outfits every day I also had to go to work to pay rent, I worked in food service and I was far more adamant than most about making both customers and coworkers mask up but some people just don't listen. If I ever had to eat, I'd go outdoors and have a bite before refining my masks and coming back in. My wife also had to go to work to pay rent and plenty of the parents and other teachers at her school were way lax about masks but what should we have done? Gotten tens of thousands in debt because we reported the school and got it shut down?- as it was we lost 1k from her salary when the last few months of school went remote last year

Yes, masked, outdoors, distanced, and usually for short periods but once or twice we ate dinner at separate tables in my parents backyard (did I mention my mom is wfh and my dad was furloughed so neither of them really went anywhere either?)

In an [article about women's side effects &amp;  the J&amp;J vaccine pause it said that the women in the trials had to be on birth control](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/women-vaccine-side-effects-johnson-pfizer-moderna-astrazeneca-1152206/). Here's the relevant part of the article:

&gt;**Some women have reported changes to their menstrual cycle after the vaccine — have you seen or heard anything about that?**

&gt;I have seen that — I haven’t seen an academic study of this. At this moment, I don’t know what to say because I’ve only seen this on Twitter. That’s not to say that anecdotal observations don’t then sometimes form the basis to study something. But I’ve had so many reporters query me, and I’ve turned immediately to the people running trials at Johns Hopkins for each of these different vaccines. And they have no specific data that’s been collected, pertaining, you know, or reporting from the people in their phase three trials about the menstrual cycle. Don’t forget that in the trials, women had to be on birth control. 

&gt;**Hormonal birth control, or just using any form of birth control?**

&gt;Using a form of birth control, but they were encouraged to be taking some type of oral contraceptive that could allow them to control and confirm they were not going to get pregnant during the trial. 

&gt;**Is the fact that there isn’t data available about the impact of the vaccines on women’s periods — is that because researchers didn’t ask about it, or because participants didn’t volunteer that information?**

&gt;I think it’s not asked about. I think aspects of other aspects of women’s health are all too often treated as “bikini science.” I think all too often and we don’t think about the fact that women may respond differently to drugs, as well as things like vaccines.

Before this the central government asked States to procure their own vaccines. It was a stupid move. The vaccine makers did not agree to deal with the states and asked Centre's intervention. The states weren't able to procure a single dose, as a result.

What happened in that interim? The local politicians used their clout to make sure private hospitals got their share and then sold these vaccines to the upper middle class in private ""vaccination drives"". A good example for this is Bangalore where residential societies and software companies signed up for such deals and paid 3x-5x over the cost of the vaccines to sell them to the upper middle class public.

Why not?  It’s a factually accurate statement to say the evidence currently available indicates higher efficacy for the mRNA vaccines (Moderna &amp; Pfizer) than that of Astra Zeneca for 2 doses each (95% vs 90%) and especially for 1 dose (90% vs 70%).

If you had a choice between Astra Zeneca and nothing then it’s obvious you should be taking any effective vaccine, including it. Though, if you had the choice between one of the mRNA vaccines vs Astra Zeneca are you telling me you’d prefer to take the likely less effective one?

I know it comes across as control to some people, and in some cases there may be abuse. But in general the state, the government, they have a responsibility to keep life moving. Keep people going out and buying and working and paying taxes, keeping the economy going. If suddenly 50k people got corona, that would have a wider effect. It wouldn't just be contained within that group, it would spread. That would take people out of work, businesses suffer, the economy suffers, we suffer. 

You've gotta see the bigger picture and not just stomp around in your room, wondering why your parents won't let you do something the way you want. There are consequences to all our actions, and the consequences of letting a huge group decide if they go unvaccinated, or unmasked, can have far reaching consequences on more than that 1 individual.

So, in short, its not about 'control' - it's about a responsibility to the wider population and everything around that. If you don't like the rules, then move.

The Pregnancy Discrimination Act was put into law to close a loophole in the Civil Rights Act regarding discrimination based on sex. Before PDA was enacted employers could fire, refuse to hire or hire at a lower salary, refuse to promote, and deny raises to women out of fear that they are/may become pregnant.

In general societies do not want to discourage birth rates. Look at the population crisis in Japan. We need young people to work and contribute to social security and do jobs older people can't do and take care of the oldest of farts. People having kids is -generally speaking- a net positive for society. (Personally I hate children and will not have any, but you have to admit they are necessary.) Biological women do not choose to be the child-carriers in the baby creation process, therefore you cannot discriminate based on pregnancy.

A better analogy would be an employer drug testing employees. Is that fair? To have to piss in a cup and divulge your drug habits. Doesn't that infringe on your personal autonomy?

Yes. Yes it does. But it's also bad for business if your employee is strung out or sneaking off to shoot up in the bathrooms, or freaking out and having an episode on the floor in front of customers. But we accept drug tests as part of the hiring process for many businesses.

Even though covid turned out to not really spread through surfaces, the fact everyone is cleaning more frequently is going to help much more substantially in the long run than wearing masks every winter.

Are they unable to vote in free and fair elections where the results are not foregone? 

Did their government decide to only vaccinate 20% of the population, the richest 20%, and only bow under immense pressure because of thousands of deaths? 

Does their government systematically literally send bulldozers to roll over small businesses and seize shopkeeper's goods? 

Is their ""news"" subject to constant gag orders so that stories of protests and political dissent never make it into international news?

Great question. There are 3 major reasons:

1. We actually don't want black people to die, and that's (as you probably know) what happens when people don't get vaccinated. This part is the ""their choice, I guess"" component, and I suppose the one people should just let go. Except...

2. Herd immunity. Without most of the population immunized, a disease continues spreading, and remains a danger to people who want to be vaccinated but can't be (e.g. immunocompromised people). And worst of all...

3. Vaccine-resistant mutation risk. If a virus isn't stopped in its tracks, it has a very high risk of becoming another influenza, where it sticks around forever, coming back again and again seasonally, because too many variants end up bouncing around to block them all at once (or even know about all of them). COVID-19 has a lot of characteristics that make it very likely to act this way if not stopped outright.  This is by far the largest problem, because if we don't stop it in all communities, it's likely to repeatedly return, cumulatively killing what could easily be upwards of 100 million people over the coming centuries.

All that said, I get why black communities would be wary of the vaccine and medical science in general, because it's done some fucked up shit to black people. But it really is imperative that every community reach herd immunity, or the world is going to have a much larger problem on its hands.

And it's not like this is asking black people to help protect white people, because if history is any indicator when it comes to long-running viruses, the hardest hit places are going to be in the global south and marginalized communities - i.e. people who are disproportionately black.",,,1623178076,{},h12709e,False,t3_nv1q1u,False,False,t1_h124pdz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nv1q1u/antivaccine_film_targeted_to_black_americans/h12709e/,1623363082,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Since she takes Rituximab (an immune modulating medication) to keep her MS at bay, she is one of the ones who is still more susceptible even though she is vaccinated. 

So, if one of her caregivers decides to go to this concert and is unvaccinated or vaccinated and gets COVID, they can bring it right into her tiny little living room before they even realize they are sick. Since they spend several hours a day with her, masks are helpful but not fully protective.

This also stands if one of the caregiver’s household members goes to the concert instead, or one of their close friends that they spend time with indoors and unmasked.

Who gives the vaccines? The military? Will the neighborhoods be ok with people in uniform going door-to-door? Will they trust this process? Will they be afraid to take the shots?

Not in the sense that I like the way we've been living the past year but because of how much this past year is gonna affect the future.

I've been in law school the past year (lockdown hit in the middle of my 2nd semester). Zoom school has sucked and I'm happy to be back in person in the fall for my final year. But I just hate how much this past year in these conditions is gonna hurt my future when I know for sure this was not the best work I could have done. Honestly was considering taking the year off and coming back next year but there was no guarantee I'd keep my scholarship if I took that year off without some life or death circumstances so I thought I'd tough it out. Turns out I underperformed so much that I will lose my scholarship for the last year (if I do well enough in the fall I can get it back for Spring) and because of this underperfomance getting a summer position is absolutely daunting (have a position as a research assistant to a professor which is better than nothing and will be working in a school clinic in the fall but no actual experience). Granted I have the support of my family and losing the scholarship (to one of the cheaper schools anyway) likely just means I'll have to suck up an hour commute instead of living on campus (which shouldnt be that bad considering the way my schedule for the fall has turned out) but it just sucks how much this past year will have on my future, especially because I'm gonna be judged on how I will work in situations that will be nothing like this past year based on this past year. I know everyone went through the same thing and sucked it up and I'm not gonna act like I was in dire circumstances but man as someone who has constantly tried to avoid being in my room on my computer all day so I can focus and not be distracted, this past year has been extra hard on me. My whole life my computer has been my escape from the world and now I'm supposed to sit here and study full time while staring at a screen all day until my eyes go numb.

...infection of pancreatic beta cells in autopsy samples from people who died of COVID-19. Additional studies by the Jackson team suggest that the coronavirus may preferentially infect the insulin-producing beta cells.  
  
This also makes biological sense. Beta cells and other cell types in the pancreas express the ACE2 receptor protein, the TMPRSS2 enzyme protein, and neuropilin 1 (NRP1), all of which SARS-CoV-2 depends upon to enter and infect human cells. Indeed, the Chen team saw signs of the coronavirus in both insulin-producing beta cells and several other pancreatic cell types in the studies of autopsied pancreatic tissue.  
  
The new findings also show that the coronavirus infection changes the function of islets—the pancreatic tissue that contains beta cells. Both teams report evidence that infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to reduced production and release of insulin from pancreatic islet tissue. The Jackson team also found that the infection leads directly to the death of some of those all-important beta cells.

It's not pedantic at all. If males could get pregnant, then 'pregnancy' would not fall under any sort of protected status.

Correct, but again lacks nuance, and doesn't have anything to do with the choice of vaccination.

I mean in the US since last year gender identity is a protect class as well. So no, you can't fire someone who is trans for simply being trans. 

Again, how does that have anything to do with the choice of vaccination? Are you trying to implicate that women have a 'choice' to be pregnant, and should be fired for it, or that someone who is trans has the 'choice' to be trans and should be fired for it?

What is already known about this topic?  
  
Most COVID-19–associated hospitalizations occur in adults, but severe disease occurs in all age groups, including adolescents aged 12–17 years.  
  
What is added by this report?  
  
COVID-19 adolescent hospitalization rates from COVID-NET peaked at 2.1 per 100,000 in early January 2021, declined to 0.6 in mid-March, and rose to 1.3 in April. Among hospitalized adolescents, nearly one third required intensive care unit admission, and 5% required invasive mechanical ventilation; no associated deaths occurred.  
  
What are the implications for public health practice?  
  
Recent increased hospitalization rates in spring 2021 and potential for severe disease reinforce the importance of continued COVID-19 prevention measures, including vaccination and correct and consistent mask wearing among persons not fully vaccinated or when required.",,,1623158795,{},h10xvqi,True,t3_nv3z9f,False,False,t3_nv3z9f,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nv3z9f/hospitalization_of_adolescents_aged_12â17_years/h10xvqi/,1623329070,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Mixed Findings  
  
So far, most studies examining whether statins might benefit people with COVID-19 have been retrospective analyses of hospitalized patients. To try to mimic randomized controlled clinical trials, researchers have matched patients who’d been taking statins with those who had not on the basis of such factors as vital signs, laboratory values, and body mass index—a method called propensity-score matching.  
  
Their findings haven’t consistently linked the drugs with a lower short-term risk of dying after contracting COVID-19. These observational studies found an association between statin use and lower mortality among patients with COVID-19:  
  
In an article published earlier this year, Gupta and her colleagues found that among 1296 New York City patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 26.5% of patients who hadn’t been taking statins died within 30 days of hospital admission compared with 14.8% of patients who used the drugs.  
  
Wayne State University researchers found that in a cohort of 466 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, those who had been taking moderate or high doses of statins, but not low doses, had a significantly reduced risk of dying compared with those who had not been taking statins. The study didn’t find a significant association between statin use and intensive care unit (ICU) admission or the need for mechanical ventilation.  
  
A study of 1179 patients with COVID-19 in Massachusetts General Hospital that has not yet been peer-reviewed found that statin use during hospitalization, newly initiated or not, was associated with improved 28-day mortality for patients older than 65 years but not for patients 65 years or younger.

Airline employee here, January/February of 2020 more than half the staff had it already at our international get together in LAS. Unfortunately, when I went to the doctor and told them, they all but laughed and tested me for strep. (Came up negative in case you're wondering) I took about 4 days off because of the high fever but had to go back because I dont get sick pay and we were already understaffed before all of us were getting sick. That didn't shut us down. Come April, I was forced to take a year off with no pay because of the shutdown. 
That includes no government unemployment checks. So while everyone complained about being 'stuck inside,' on their cozy government paid butts, I found another second job to attempt to stay on my feet and pay my rent and bills. Caught Covid again in November, much milder but same symptoms. Actually had testing sites then and was confirmed positive. Thats how I know myself and others had it 10 months prior.
Exactly one year later and I'm recalled back in to work at the airport. Still not vaccinated. Go ahead, attack me for it. I have my flu vax last year and will get it this year as well. But being comfortable taking something that 1. Has multiple versions 2. Not all side effects showed in testing 3. Was rushed imo 4. Has everyone screamimg at you to take it.... is not something I can be. So, I wear my mask. Everywhere I go. At both my jobs. Of which, my airline job is understaffed, because after offering early retirement and letting numerous positions go, they want to be picky about what is in an employee's system. 

The real issue in my eyes: they don't care if you have antibodies, they REQUIRE a vaccine. What's the difference? Why cant someone show that they've had the virus and give a record of antibodies?

The institution that *still* uses troops as guinea pigs has no qualms with this due to some arbitrary pedantry.

FWIW, I am one of them!

I am also immunosuppressed, but fully vaccinated with two shots of Moderna.  Because I was worried about some of the news I read, I had my primary care doc order a test from Quest Diagnostics, the SARS-CoV-2 Antibody (IgG), Spike, Semi-Quantitative test, to see if I had any antibodies or not. My test returned as positive and also as ""High"", which was a value of ""&gt; 20"" of whatever units are used in the test.  Per my doctor, he said this was a good result.  Please be mindful that there's no guidance to show what levels are considered protective (yet), but if you do have antibodies that might give you some peace of mind.  If you have *no* antibodies, well then you can discuss getting a booster shot or a different vaccine (like if you got an mRNA vaccine, get the J&amp;J shot).  Also, no antibodies doesn't mean you're not protected, because the immune system has more than just antibodies at its disposal to fight off infections (T-cells, B-cells, etc).

So, if I were you, I'd ask your doctor to order the antibody test and see what it shows.  The results should get back to you in a few days, well before you get your procedure. 

I myself am getting a procedure done in a few weeks and this gives me some peace of mind for sure, because I've been putting things off for fear of COVID.

The pertinent two are sub-definition (B) and (C)

Anything regarding the government involves cases. You as a citizen are documented and filed in a folder with multiple case files. When you go do your taxes, a case file is filled out for what happens during this review process, when you get your postage checked, a case file is opened to show on your medical record that you had this done, possibly as a routine check or possibly because you were concerned you may have cancer. Depending on the severity of your medical condition when you go get checked a case file with a (pretext) will be investigated. 

Example, mri shows you have a tumour growth, a case file is opened into the possibility of cancer. This doesn’t mean you have cancer, it doesn’t signify what stage or type of cancer you have, if you even do, but the case for file investigating cancer has been opened. 

For covid-19 when you go get tested for covid, you are opening a case file on your medical record. This record is to investigate/conclude if you have Corona virus. 

A “confirmed case” is poor wording. It’s like saying a “confirmed homework assignment” it doesn’t actually reflect the nature of what it is. Would a “confirmed homework assignment” mean it’s confirmed you finished your homework? Would it mean it’s confirming you received the homework? We don’t know until we have context, but for medical cases we do know how they work. A “confirmed case” just means, you are confirmed to have a case file open to investigation for if you have covid. To back this up, this is precisely how you’re even able to be a part of the medical documentation system. Most testing for covid you receive the result later, how is this possible? Because after testing your CASE file is updated and then a medical practitioner can open your CASE file and call you to give you the results. A confirmed case is just saying, yes you have been confirmed to have an investigation open into your covid potential. 

It doesn’t matter if you test negative or positive, because this case will be on your medical record permanently. It’s like how a doctor can follow up with you for any health condition. Like for example you may have went in for a pain in your chest, and you go back 3 months later and the doctor pulls up your case files and sees “a yes sir you were here 3 months ago for a pain in your chest, you rated it a 4/10 pain and we prescribed you this for the pain, how is that doing?” Case files never disappear, you will always be a “confirmed case” of covid when you choose to get tested. With the inclusion of “contract tracing” some numbers have actually been inflated because without even getting testing, your name and location will put in you a category to just assume you have covid because you were near someone who was “infected”. 

It’s the same reason you may received an emergency alert if you’re in the area of a potential tornado. The government resources track your identity and location and make assumptions regarding your safety. If they see John Doe live in x region and x region is a covid hotspot they will just add John Doe to the covid list assuming the worst. It’s hardly conspiratorial, it’s just a poor system that was haphazardly put in place in the effort of reducing the spread of covid by identifying potential infections before they can get out of hand, but all Thai really does is unjustly target certain regions and inflate the numbers making covid seem worse than it is. 

And then let’s talk about pcr testing. https://youtu.be/TdIsTLg7RQM here is the YouTube video with the most views which is supposed to be an official understanding of how pcr testing works. It literally states in the video (and multiple others if you care to look) that the pcr test will “detect” the tiny amount of covid in your body, and use the pulmonary chain reaction to multiple these covid cells exponentially in order to be able to test for covid. Why is this? Some may say “it’s because we need to identity covid before it’s serious” and that may be a fair point. But how pcr tests are being used is abusive. It’s taking healthy people with no sign of true infection, only minuscule amounts, and concluding they are asymptotic and sick and need to be quarantined. 

You may think having covid in any capacity means you’re sick, asymptomatic, whatever else, but you’re wrong. Throughout all of history we have been carriers of multiple foreign bodies. The human body itself is actually more foreign cells than human cells if you didn’t know. 

[here](https://youtu.be/DwJn4SE9Uu8) is a very rudimentary look into this. When exploring “what kind of symbiotic organism the fictional character Venom is, this youtuber details how we are very much a living symbiotic life form, with more foreign cells in our gut bacteria colony than we have of any other cells. You can look into this. This is why people recommend probiotics and yogurt and stuff like that, to keep your gut bacteria fed healthy stuff. Quite literally we need to feed foreign cells in our body to keep them keeping us healthy. 

Covid, while not something looking to improve or body, is not magically going to kill you and everyone around you just by being present. On your face lives thousands of tiny parasites that eat at your dead skin cells, at this very moment. They are foreign, and they don’t hurt you even though they are literally living off of your body. Covid like anything, can just be present for a short duration, and then leave. Especially if the immune system seems it too dangerous. 

NEEDING to be tested by pcr is proof that covid is in fact not serious, not like for exam ken cyanide or risen poisoning (both organic poisons that are very deadly to human life, even in tiny amounts) compared to cyanide, covid is a joke. While not infection, the pint being that a trace amount of cyanide kills you, a trace amount of covid doesn’t. And no, a trace amount logically can not spread. 

Know what we’ve been doing for all of modern human history when we get sick? We stay home, sweat, cough, sneeze bathe, got shower, soup, all self isolation practises, it’s not just for our benefit but others as well. When we are sick and have runny nose, sneezing, coughing ONLY THEN can be be asymptotic carriers. When you are what they are trying to redefine as asymptomatic for covid, you aren’t sick. If you aren’t infected enough to be sick yourself, how can you be infected enough to transmit covid? It’s illogical. There LITERALLY isn’t enough covid present in your own body for that covid to have even taken a toll on your health, so how can it spread, multiple and infect another person when it barely has even colonized your body? That’s not how viruses work, and covid isn’t some super virus, for it to be such it would need to infect a person faster, you’d need to have illness with it a day or two for it to be even remotely close to a super virus. 

When I had younger family members going to school, often they’d bring home some flu or bug and get me sick. My own work, travel, association with anyone would never get me sick, only living with someone who has gotten some bug, because that bug has hitchhiked off their immunity which is similar to mine because of blood relation making it easier to infect me. So even the notion that you should only keep to your household when infected is ridiculous. You don’t get well by staying cooped up in a household where people may be sick. Especially forced to live in a household for months under the guise of public safety. Health doesn’t come from staying inside, it comes from going out and building immunity. 

What they call asymptomatic people, are actually the people who are meant to build societies herd immunity. Not vaccines, the power of the human immune system. Vaccines are only needed when a person is so unwell their own immune system doesn’t function correctly. That’s it.

\- We believe that he became infected during the holiday, says national team doctor Anders Valentin from a press conference in Gothenburg.  
  
The players were given time off after the camp in Bastad, which ended with the international match against Finland on May 29, and Kulusevski remains in Stockholm.  
  
\- He felt cold this morning and at did a PCR test which was positive. He has taken it well. Our hope is that he has not infected anyone, says national team doctor Anders Valentin, the sampling took place at the player hotel in Stockholm, who says that the players did not have such close contact but that distance has been kept according to the authorities' recommendations.  
  
\- We have identified those who have been closest to him, those who have sat and eaten with him and been close to him in the bus. Those people have no symptoms. They are tested today and we will get an answer pretty soon. But if they have become infected, it probably happened yesterday, and then it will have a positive effect later this week, says Valentin.  
  
**Bite together and said ""I will get well""**

  
The national team will continue to train as usual, a ""one-way training"" today. The hope is that the infection is mild, but even if Kulusevski recovers quickly, he will miss at least one match in the European Championship play-offs in terms of isolation time.  
  
\- He was sad and you heard how he bit together and said that ""I will get well"", says national team manager Stefan Pettersson about how 21-year-old Kulusevski took the message.  
  
\- FHM's recommendation is that you should be home from work for seven days. One week is the minimum, says Valentin and excludes games for Kulusevski against Spain in the European Championship premiere.  
  
The Swedish national team and Uefa have no opportunities to create priority in the vaccination queue, but the players have to wait their time according to the schedule set by FHM.  
  
\- It is not right that we should be vaccinated before everyone else, says Janne Andersson.  
  
**""No outbreak but just one case""**

  
\- It is not an outbreak but just a case. There are many positive points in the middle of all the misery, says Valentin.  
  
The next PCR test will be done in three days.  
  
The message has created a mood in the squad.  
  
\- It's very sad for Dejan, just to apologize, and the rest of us. It is extremely unfortunate that we got the infection. It creates a certain amount of anxiety, but we have to deal with what arises. I would have liked to have been without it, says national team captain Janne Andersson.  
  
The national team arrived during the day in Gothenburg and its base. Shortly after arrival, the national team management announced that the press conference, which was scheduled for after training at 18.30, but it took place at 16.00 instead.  
  
\- There are good reasons for the move, said press officer Jakob Kakembo Andersson before the press conference.  
  
Shortly afterwards, journalist Patrick Ekwall tweeted that according to his sources, someone in the Swedish squad has tested positive for covid-19.

It went through all three phases of clinical trials that a normal vaccine would go through, it just cut through the red tape faster.  
Companies who apply for EUA and successfully get admitted to the process are guaranteed that the fed will dump a bunch of money into the manufacturing of the vaccine once it is determined to be safe and effective. That way, these companies can focus their money into funding development of their vax candidate. Normally, they have to make sure to balance out their funds.  
In the EUA process, the FDA also pooled all kinds of resources to focus on emergency development and production. An academic research lab I know got their research paused and were asked to contribute to the effort last summer. I don't know exactly what they did (or if they helped, they had a choice) but my guess is that they could've made some copies of the mRNA for the clinical trials, based on their capabilities.

Oh, definitely not. The person you were talking to was totally incorrect. You were just criticizing them for the wrong thing. That's all I'm saying. 

&gt;How can you have an opinion on facts?

By either thinking that they are the case or by thinking that they are not the case. Statements can be both facts *and* opinions. A lot of people are erroneously taught that there is a dichotomy of fact vs. opinion and that statements can always be categorized as one or the other (and maybe that happened to you in school). But that's very wrong. The dichotomies are truth (i.e. fact) vs. untruth and belief (i.e. opinion) vs. disbelief. One is about reality and the other is about some person's brain. 

""The Moon exists"" is a fact. And it is also an opinion shared by essentially every person. ""The Moon was exactly 6 kg more massive exactly 2 billion years ago today"" *might* be a fact. If it is, no one believes that it is, so it is no one's opinion. We'll probably never know for sure. (And definitely no one will ever care.) Opinions like ""the reptilian aliens are in control of the government"" or ""the COVID-19 vaccines do not work"" are not facts. And then there are things which are neither opinions *nor* facts. Like bizarre and wrong statements about arithmetic using large numbers that no one's ever thought of before, such as ""1234567 + 1000000 = 2234568"". No one believes that and it's also not true.

Believing fringe conspiracy theories isn’t a protected class, religion, race, gender or sexual orientation. It’s a choice.

“The CDC says it has investigated the 4,000-plus reports of death from Covid-19 vaccines through May 10 and found no “causal link” to any Covid-19 vaccine, though “recent reports indicate a plausible causal relationship between” the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine and a “rare and serious adverse event—blood clots with low platelets—which has caused deaths.” 

Vaers “is simply a system for people to report bad things that happen to them after vaccination, whether or not those events are caused by the vaccine,” Dr. William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Forbes.”

There are all manner of chemicals in our environment approved by government bodies such as the FDA that we are now learning are cause all manner of health problems, from cancer, to endocrine disruption. So, in my opinion they don't know what they are doing.

If they really had a solid understanding of how the human body works we would have found cures to diseases that they have been working on for centuries - cancer, heart disease, alzheimer's, scitzophrenia, diabetes, paralysis ... on and on.

Are you asking what is the purpose of FDA approval as a whole or only as it relates to the Covid-19 vaccine? We study drugs, foods, additives, etc over a long period of time because we know there are such things as long term complications. I may be misunderstanding your question but to me, this is very straight forward.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Because it's ridiculous to discuss a risk of something that almost never occurs.

Would you tell your child to stand under a tree during a storm because getting struck by lightning ""almost never occurs""?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;if there was something egregiously wrong with the vaccines, how come we haven't heard about it?

We have heard about it. That's why there has been immediate halting of certain vaccines - because there are real complications that can be (and have been) life threatening.   


""U.S. CDC and FDA are reviewing data involving six reported U.S. cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot in individuals after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine. In these cases, a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) was seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia). All six cases occurred among women between the ages of 18 and 48, and symptoms occurred 6 to 13 days after vaccination.""

&gt; My palpitations are opposite of yours - instead of extra beats, my heart literally stops, skips a beat, then hits back twice as hard on the next beat and makes me cough. Quite uncomfortable.

Be careful with definitions. All heart anomalies have specific definitions. AFAIK, to qualify for skipping a beat there must be a long pause (I think 2+ seconds) in heart rhythm.  

In my case, the extra beat is not called extra because it comes in addition to the normal beats but because it comes from outside of the normal mechanism that controls the heart rhythm.

[Here's an example](https://imgur.com/8jz0FVl)

That 3rd beat comes not just in an irregular time slot but it's also triggered anomalously as evidenced by its fucked up waveform. It suppresses the 3rd normal beat that should've happened in its regular time slot and creates that anomalously long pause between itself and the 4th beat that happens normally.  

I can feel these anomalous beats in two ways: (1) they are much stronger than normal beats, like a heart spasm, sometimes creating strong physical waves through my stomach and (2) sometimes I feel blood pressure variations in my head with each such anomalous beat, giving me a very short and transient diziness.

At my worst I've had hours long episodes where one beat was normal, one was abnormal, one normal, etc. It's called Bigeminy and it feels really really bad. As things went under some control, my episodes started to have rarer abnormal beats, like one in 4 beats, then one in 6-10 and so on.

I've also had occasional situations where 2 abnormal beats happened one after another but these were rare and they feel even worse. Three abnormal in a row happened even rarer. AFAIK, multiple abnormal heart beats one after another is a serious problem that requires immediate monitoring in ER or, even if it stops, a visit to a cardiologist.",,,1623176483,{},h1238s7,False,t3_nrn00u,False,True,t1_h103ec1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nrn00u/israel_sees_probable_link_between_pfizer_vaccine/h1238s7/,1623360323,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I'm open to the possibility I misunderstood this

&gt;But if you're choosing not to vaccinate because your health provider advised against it that doesn't put you in the same category as the people we're talking about.

A lot people have pointed out that apparently they don't think the person I responded to meant it that way. The way I read them, based on the juxtaposition if their statement and the policy they referred to, it sounded like they were saying that only reason ppl aren't getting vaccinated is due to refusal rather than inability.

You might see a number of articles quoting Fauci saying the opposite, but you also need to pay attention to his wording.

&gt; If we get to the goals that the president has established — namely **if we get 70% of the people vaccinated** by the fourth of July

Currently we're at 63.7% of adults with one dose, so it might be close, but we probably won't hit 70% by the 4th. Plus, a number of states are *significantly* worse than the country's average.

&gt; **you may see blips** but **if we handle them well** it is unlikely that you'll see **the kind of surge** that we saw in the late fall and the early winter

We're not going to reach those crazy numbers again, but things could still get worse than the they currently are.

When I walked into the mass vax center, it seemed like the scene of a movie where the army was directing everyone into large batches of people to get vaccinated. I don’t have any peer reviewed studies to show you or to guide you, although there are certainly many out there if you do a quick cursory search. However, I know that there’s so much uncertainty and distrust in the “top science” academia right now that many studies are just not good enough for lots of people, and i’m guessing for you as well. I know it sucks because we grow up and are told to trust these scientists and researchers but it’s such a far removed field from most of our daily lives that we don’t have really much basis to trust them on besides their history. 

I’m not here to really convince you hard that this vaccine is safe because frankly, we’re all nobodies on the internet, and like I said, if I were raised in a different place or family or around different friends or experiences, I can see myself not willing to trust it either.

It’s a hard step to take, especially injecting something directly into your body and seemingly changing you from the inside and that you can’t take back once you do it.
