2. approved without proper examination by EU authorities, and lacking/sped up examination by local authorities - in case of the Sputnik the approval process was sped up and superficial, in case of Sinopharm it was *skipped altogether* and they basically made a law so it would be approved;
3. acquired in ways to maximize corruption (especially in case of Sinopharm it's fairly well-documented);
4. pushed on people despite well-documented and effective Western vaccines also being available;
5. pushed on people without regards of what little documentation was available, see again: Sinopharm being used widely on the elderly, despite existing documentation stating that the elderly weren't the target demo for the vaccine at all - as a result, we have millions of people vaccinated with Sinopharm who may not be safe *whatsoever,* and are a ticking time bomb. Many people who have received the Sinopharm have tested themselves for antibodies and found that they had *none.* Zero. Nada.

Why don‚Äôt we also push for insurance to guarantee coverage for people who may experience side effects from taking the vaccine?  

&gt; High school senior Emma Burkey received her ‚Äúone and done‚Äù Johnson &amp; Johnson coronavirus vaccine on March 20, and within two weeks was in an induced coma following seizures and clotting in her brain.

&gt;She‚Äôs making a slow recovery, having recently been transfered from the hospital to a rehabilitation center, and the first round of bills totaled $513,000. The 18-year-old‚Äôs family friends in the Las Vegas area started a GoFundMe account to help with medical expenses from the very rare vaccine reaction.

&gt; Burkey‚Äôs family can‚Äôt look to J&amp;J to cover the medical costs not picked up by her insurance because a 2005 law‚Äîextended last year to include the COVID-19 pandemic‚Äîshields manufacturers and health-care providers from state and federal liability in instances of public health and bioterrorism emergencies.

https://fortune.com/2021/05/03/us-covid-vaccine-side-effects-getting-medical-costs-covered/

If the government can shield the vaccine makers from lability, then insurance companies may need to step up to guarantee protection and compensation for those who end up with huge medical bills as a direct result from taking the vaccine.

If we argue that insurance should be off the hook and that individuals should be fully liable for the bill, then we can no longer coerce or bully people into taking the vaccine.  If we tell them they alone should be responsible for the risk, then they are accountable to no one but themselves regarding their decision to vaccinate.  Unless you‚Äôre offering to pay their hospital bill should things go south, you have no valid opinion about their decision.

Note to add that this child‚Äôs hospital bill is about half a million dollars.  If even 5% of the people who insists on pushing for everyone to vaccinate throws in a dollar, her bill should be covered already.

Delta variant cases rose by 33,630 in the week to June 8, to a total of 75,953, a 79% increase on the previous week, the PHE data revealed.  
It also showed that 99% of cases in the U.K., sequenced and genotyped to identify variants, were the Delta variant.  
As of June 14, a total of 806 people have been hospitalized with the variant, an increase of 423 on the previous week. PHE said 527 of those were unvaccinated, with only 84 of the 806 having been fully vaccinated.",,,1624216074,{},h2ggtoj,False,t3_o4cf2p,False,False,t1_h2gg92o,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o4cf2p/models_predict_us_coronavirus_infections_could/h2ggtoj/,1624523681,5,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That's why I have to roll my eyes at the people who say they won't get vaccinated because they don't have any pre-existing conditions.

&gt;Thank you for requesting a link to your digital COVID-19 vaccine record. The link to your COVID-19 vaccine record *and QR code is valid* for 24 hours.   
View Vaccine Record:

A QR code can't expire.  If it's a valid code, scanning it always and forever provides data.  The usefulness of that data may expire.  This is confusing because *usually* QR codes are things like URLs.  If you think of it this way, the webpage that a URL points to could be changed to say ""expired"" or simply be deleted.  However, the QR code would still point to it, because that's what the encoded data says.

In this case, the QR code starts off with the handler shc:/ 

That handler is for Smart Health Cards.  More information can be found about them at:

[https://smarthealth.cards](https://smarthealth.cards)

The rest of the data following the shc:/ is a long string of numbers that will bring up your vaccine information (that you saw on the website with the QR code) if you use a SHC reader (device or app).

So does it expire?

I don't know.  However, this wouldn't make sense at all if it were to expire in 24 hours.  It seems like it would be an unnecessary step to use the QR code if you're going to need to go to the website every day anyway.  It also seems like it would be much harder to combat fraud if everyone was resubmitting to the website every day.

However in theory, the SHC record could be deleted after 24 hours.  Again, while I don't *think* this is the case, I wouldn't be surprised if the SHC record were to be deleted at *some* point in time.",,,1624215405,{},h2gfivc,False,t3_o498qf,False,False,t3_o498qf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o498qf/california_rolls_out_digital_vaccine_verification/h2gfivc/,1624523038,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,

With OG covid we might have had a chance but Delta's spread is so high that we'll keep having small pockets of unvaccinated getting infected, with, as you say, also some breakthrough cases. It'll be limited, it will keep happening, but the main thing that needs to be considered is that the impact will be low. Our healthcare system will manage, just like it does with the flu.

I get your main concern of a variant resistant. However with the level of vaccinations, it is highly unlikely to happen in our country. If you are actually worried about that then you might as well buckle up because the world will not be vaccinated for a long time, and never will get to a sufficient percentage before another variant will come along. The good thing is that variants that escape the vaccines will be incredibly rare according to most knowledgeable people. If it happens, there is apparently a good chance that the virus will be unable to do the things its good at in the first place, attaching to humans. 

The reality is that we are going to have to risk accept for a while. Sure, we could wait until we have 75% fully vaxxed, but after that, what are you going to do? Stay locked up with borders closed until some antivaxxers change their mind so we can reach herd immunity? Fantasy thinking at best. And what if we open the borders?  We still have a antivax neighbor down south that'll likely keep bringing over cases for a long time.

What you're saying is effectively the same as a lockdown for the next years, with prolonging in the case something else comes around.

Live your life, vaccines DO work perfectly fine against hospitalization and death. They're not watertight, but neither are a lot of other things in life we risk accept. People will die, that is something you are going to have to live with, however awful that is.

These aren't ""experimental"" as in ""we aren't sure it's safe"", it's experimental in the sense of ""how does time between doses relate to effectiveness"", ""how long does immunity last"", ""what is the shelf life under different storage conditions"", etc.

What was streamlined was the types of studies and timing between studies.  For example, [this study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368728) of Pfizer/BioNTech was a combined Phase I/II/III trial.  This is just one of 26 vaccine trials for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine alone.  You'll also notice that the trial hasn't concluded, but the interim results are being shared with regulatory agencies, and that is what the Emergency Use Approvals are based on.  The trials also focused on a limited number of dosage regimens, and dosages.

The safety of these vaccines should be on par with any approved vaccine.  Safety is tested *first*.  That it is effective is shown second.  Phase IV would be monitoring, and would provide more information on *how* safe and *how* effective.  Also, if there wasn't a rush you would have also tested different dosing regimens, storage conditions, etc.

So yes, experimental in that we don't know *how* long immunity lasts, how long you can spread out the two doses or the two dose shots, if different dosages would be more effective, and rarer problems.  We are in that Phase IV right now, and there are literally **100s of millions** of people who have been vaccinated now.  This is why the blood clots associated with the Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine were discovered.  They occur at 1 in 100,000 or less, meaning it was too rare and unusual to show up in the trials.

Another example of how these are ""still experimental"" is in dosing regimen. For example, here in Canada, we chose to focus on giving more people first doses rather than fully vaccinating people.  This seems to have been a good gamble.  Pfizer and Moderna didn't really test single dose effectiveness, choosing to instead play it safe, and test just one dosing regimen.  Although some participants were removed from the dosing schedule after only one dose, providing some information.

With respects to the ""still experimental"" sentiment, while technically true, studies still showed that is was *at least* safe enough and *at least* effective enough to consider approval.  Not an expert in the vaccine approval process (unless you count the Google Skool of Lurning), but my understanding is that the normal flow of vaccine approval would involve completing small trials, submitting the results, getting approvals for the next stage, doing slightly larger trials, submitting results for approvals, etc. slowly building up to large Phase 3 trials.  These vaccines have just as large if not larger trials, just without the steps in between where results are collated, submitted, and approvals or further trials requested.  Also consider how we even *have* interim results.  Normally, the trials would conclude, results would be collated, then submitted, then reviewed.

---

To save anyone looking it up, the study linked as an example is only really testing one candidate after the Phase I stage, BNT162b2 at 30¬µg with 21 days between doses.  Would a second dose of 15¬µg be as effective? What about 28 days?  More effective?  Less effective?  Those are the sorts of things *not* being tested yet.  All that's being tested is that BNT162b2 at two 30¬µg doses 21 days apart is **safe and effective**.

There will be a third dose or fourth dose of 5¬µg, 10¬µg or 30¬µg eventually provided to test for ""boostability"".  This means the trial won't fully conclude for another year or so.  If interim results show safety and effectiveness of one dosing regimen for a disease that is killing people *right now*, does it really make sense for full approval?",,,1624207957,{},h2g0h79,False,t3_o44201,False,False,t1_h2ft9mc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o44201/covid19_uks_longestknown_coronavirus_patient_dies/h2g0h79/,1624515396,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

On the other hand, I do want to point out that antibody test is probably not best to determine protection according to US FDA. I think this have been discussed here quite a lot times. T cell activation is more important. And after vaccination, there were people saying they tested negative for nucleocapsid antibody test, and their spike protein antibody test came back positive. And this was about Pfizer/BNT, I'm not sure it applies to only m-RNA or any vaccine technology.

That being said, I totally understand that people would love to have a positive antibody test to confirm their protection against the virus. I will feel safer too.

And I still find the relationship between antibody level and protection level interesting and mysterious. Sinovac had higher antibody level than Sinopharm, but it efficacy rate is substantially lower. Also Curevac had a really high antibody level in its trial, higher than Sinopharm, Sinovac, J&amp;J, AZ.

The fact is that Europe is opening up and I am no longer prepared to double quarantine just because I decided to put myself forward for a trial. Added to this, UK and EU governments are not prepared to state timelines around efforts to coordinate, so I am being forced to double vaccinate. The reality is that this global pandemic won't be over until we are ALL vaccinated with approved vaccines, and it is very clear Novavax have massive supply chain issues around a few key ingredients that based on more recent Reuters reports, suggest that vaccine won't get approval until the end of the year.

For American participants this might be fine as you have a big country, but for those of us in Europe with borders, especially in Brexit Britain, those of us with family that cross borders, we are effectively now fucked if we bothered to put ourselves forward last year to help the common good.

I'm one of those who also has double Pfizer, my partner as well, and I still remain quite cautious by nature. However, I'll simply note that as of now, I don't believe there have been ANY cases of long-COVID in vaccinated individuals. The only breakthrough cases seem to be mild or asymptomatic. Further, the CDC notes: ""If it is discovered a dose has been inadvertently administered within a grace period of ‚â§4 days from the recommended date for the second dose (i.e., 17‚Äì20 days after dose 1), the dose is considered valid."" So, you and your spouse are fine in that sense.

I think it's healthy to get out more, and ease on the restrictions that make sense. For example, it simply doesn't make sense scientifically to wear a mask outdoors, especially with family you know. Not saying you should run up and kiss them if they're unvaccinated and that concerns you, but there is such a miniscule amount of risk just standing outside near others that I think you might be holding yourself back from necessarily relaxing a little. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. I used to demand the most strict procedures for grocery decon, masking while going anywhere outside the home for any reason, etc. Now I'm vaccinated and working two jobs as a bartender and a grocery store shelf stocker (arguably two pretty ""risky"" jobs COVID-wise).

A new study, coordinated by researchers from the Federal University of Pelotas and Harvard University (USA), revealed that in Brazil, immunization against Covid-19 prevented the death of more than 43,000 people in 2021 alone.

According to the survey, in January, deaths caused by the coronavirus among people aged 70 and older represented 25% of the total. In May, for individuals between 70 and 79, the number dropped to 16%; for those over 80, the drop was even greater, to 12.4%. The study argues that if it weren't for vaccination, Brazil would have already surpassed 530,000 deaths from Covid-19.

The research serves as proof of the efficiency of the CoronaVac and Astrazeneca immunizers, which are applied in larger quantities in the country. According to the study, 94% of the elderly aged 70 years and older have received at least the first dose of the vaccine.

The results corroborate the findings of other experiments, such as the one conducted in the S√£o Paulo city of Serrana, which proved CoronaVac's ability to reduce up to 86% of hospitalizations and 95% of deaths from coronavirus infection. The survey should be updated in a few months, covering the analysis of the immunization impacts over a longer period of time.",,,1624219524,{},h2gnlkp,True,t3_o4dt4e,False,False,t3_o4dt4e,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o4dt4e/research_vaccination_in_brazil_averted_at_least/h2gnlkp/,1624527131,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;&gt; We also found that individuals with 
APOE E4/E4 have lower expression of anti
viral defense genes compared to individuals with APOEE3/E3, suggesting lack of expression of these geniuses and potentially an elevated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell models showed an elevated susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in APOE E4/E4 brain cells [103].

&gt;&gt; Summarizing, we have identified a SARS-CoV-2 protein that induces the aggregation of Œ±S in the test tube. In the initial interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein and Œ±S, multi-protein complexes are formed. In the presence of N-protein the onset of Œ±S aggregation into amyloid fibrils is strongly accelerated,  indicating that N-protein  facilitates  the  formation of a critical nucleus for aggregation. Fibril formation is not only faster, but also proceeds in an unusual two-step process. In cells,  the presence of N-protein changes the distribution of Œ±S over different conformations that likely
 represent different functions  at  already  short timescales. Disturbance of Œ±S  proteostasis might be a first  step towards nucleation of fibrils. Our results point toward a direct interaction between N-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and Œ±S as molecular basis for the observed relations between virus infections and parkinsonism. The observed molecular interactions thus suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may have long term implications and that caution is required in considering N-protein as an alternative target in vaccination strategies.",,,1624219453,{},h2gnezd,False,t3_o44201,False,True,t1_h2giz94,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o44201/covid19_uks_longestknown_coronavirus_patient_dies/h2gnezd/,1624527047,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I googled ‚Äúnatural immunity variants‚Äù and this is what I found:

&gt; A new study, released on the preprint medRxiv* server, demonstrates that vaccines may be less effective at countering the newer variants compared to natural infection.

https://www.news-medical .net/news/20210409/Does-natural-infection-with-SARS-CoV-2-offer-more-protection-than-a-vaccine-against-new-variants.aspx

I didn‚Äôt use deceptive search terms.  I didn‚Äôt go to page 7 of google results to find this article.  It‚Äôs right there at the top of the page.

Yes, you can find articles that say otherwise as well.  Which just shows it‚Äôs not settled science.  The American Medical Association held a debate and discussion forum two days ago where doctors and scientists were from both sides of the debate.  And yes, there were doctors at the AMA forum who suggest previously infected individuals may not need to be vaccinated and may qualify for immunity credentials.  Are these doctors at the AMA plague rats too?

I‚Äôm not even trying to argue which side is right or wrong.  All I‚Äôm saying is calling everyone you disagree with ‚Äúplague rats‚Äù is incredibly dehumanizing, inflammatory, and in poor taste.  You can call them risky, you can call them inconsiderate, you can even argue they are misinformed or under informed.  But ‚Äúplague rat‚Äù is just hateful.  

Also, you have no idea why some people make the decisions they do because you don‚Äôt live their lives and you don‚Äôt have to suffer through the personal consequences of the decisions those people make.  Some people choose not to vaccinate for legitimate reasons.  Yet to you, they are all ‚Äúplague rats‚Äù.

But anyway, even assuming you're right, my point still stands - it makes no sense to apply precautions to avoid a future event whose consequence will be...applying the same precautions, while those precautions likely wouldn't prevent the event from happening in the first place. 

If we assume that a vaccine-evading variant will emerge due to the mere presence of vaccinated people (as in, a variant that outcompetes the others due to its ability to evade vaccines), then it makes no sense to apply precautions because the variant will just emerge anyway and we won't be able to avoid it so I'd rather be free in the meantime.

If we assume that a vaccine-evading variant will emerge in the scenario you described, then the most logic response is to vaccinate as many people as possible, and then remove precautions because vaccines would kill the circulation and therefore the chances for the virus to mutate.

The biggest source of concern for me is that we live in an area with about 30% of the population fully vaccinated, and less than 40% having started vaccination- and the numbers are tapering off quickly. My state has the highest number of cases of the delta variant, and even though the pfizer vaccine remains fairly effective against it, the sheer number of opportunities to come across infected people here makes me uncomfortable with the risk.

The vaccine rollout here was also a complete debacle. We were scheduled for our second dose a couple of days early, and the hospital administering the vaccine refused to move our appointment to adhere to the full 21-day guidance for timing between both doses, so we ended up getting our second shots at day 19. I have no idea at this point what that might have done to the overall level of effectiveness with respect to the vaccine for us.

Finally, there just doesn't seem to be a lot of discussion around the risks of long covid or some of the nastier covid symptoms for people who have been infected.

Taipei, June 20 (CNA) Taiwan on Sunday reported 109 new cases of COVID-19, marking its eighth straight day of daily case numbers below 200, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).

Despite the decline in the daily number of cases, however, the nationwide Level 3 COVID-19 alert will not be lowered at this time, as the country has not yet met the criteria for a downgrade, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (Èô≥ÊôÇ‰∏≠) said at a news briefing.

The main conditions for a Level 3 alert, the second highest on the CECC's four-tier scale, are three community clusters within a week or 10 domestically transmitted cases from unknown sources in one day, Chen said.

The national Level 3 alert, which is in effect at least until June 28, was first implemented on May 19 and was extended twice.

Chen said it is not yet clear whether Taiwan will meet the criteria for lowering the COVID-19 alert in a week's time.

The 109 new COVID-19 cases confirmed in Taiwan on Sunday represented its lowest single-day number in more than a month. All except two were domestic infections, with New Taipei reporting 44, Taipei 31, and Taoyuan 16.

Nine of the 16 cases reported in Taoyuan were linked to the city's Armed Forces General Hospital, where a cluster has broken out, CECC official Lo Yi-chun (ÁæÖ‰∏ÄÈàû) said.

In the cluster, four patients and five caregivers at the hospital have tested positive for COVID-19, after two nurses there were confirmed to be infected, Lo said.

The hospital has stopped admitting patients and has suspended its outpatient and emergency services, as more COVID-19 testing is being carried out, a Taoyuan City government official said Sunday, at a separate press briefing.

In other parts of Taiwan, Taichung reported six cases, Hsinchu County four, and Miaoli County three, while one each was confirmed in Keelung City and Changhua and Yilan counties, according to the CECC.

Two of the 107 new domestic infections had unknown sources, while three are being investigated, the CECC said.

The two imported cases, meanwhile, involved a Philippine national who came to Taiwan to work and a Taiwanese citizen who recently returned from Japan, the CECC said.

The 11 deaths reported Sunday were five men and six women, aged 40-100, who passed away between June 15 and June 18, it said.

In two of the fatalities, the patients were in their 40s and 50s and both had chronic kidney disease and high blood pressure, the CECC said.

To date, Taiwan has confirmed a total of 14,005 COVID-19 cases, over 12,600 of which are domestic infections reported since May 15, when the country first recorded more than 100 cases in a single day.

The number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths in the country has risen to 549, with all except 12 recorded since May 15, CECC data shows.

Sometimes by chance one of these mutations makes the virus more fit by becoming more infectious.  Since the virus most likely originated in animals, there's room for the virus to improve.  There have been cases where immunocompromised patients with long-term COVID infections have been found to develop variant COVID mutations over time.  Potentially their immune system puts just enough pressure on the virus to select for mutants that can escape antibody detection.

That may be for the best, as experts say China has yet to provide satisfactory data to show that its vaccines effectively block transmission of the virus and its variants. Of the seven shots approved for use in the Chinese mainland, five are inactivated-virus vaccines. Four of these have considerably lower efficacy rates than the mRNA shots developed in the West.

Countries like Seychelles and Chile, which have fully vaccinated half or more of their populations largely with Chinese vaccines, have reported continued surges in daily caseloads, though deaths remain relatively low.

Last week, hundreds of Indonesian healthcare workers were reported to have contracted Covid-19, with dozens hospitalised, despite having been inoculated with the Chinese vaccines.

Even with the mRNA shots, like those from Pfizer and Moderna, ""it is still possible that a future variant will be able to break through to produce another iteration of the pandemic"", said Prof Muennig.

""Even if there are no hospitalisations or deaths, the risk of upwards of 25 per cent of the population being permanently disabled by long-term Covid-19 symptoms should give us all pause,"" he said, adding that long-haul Covid-19 is likely to be a public health problem for decades to come.

Nearly a fifth of Covid-19 patients without symptoms went on to experience conditions consistent with long-haul Covid-19 a month after their initial diagnosis, according to a recent US study that surveyed nearly two million Americans over a year.

The figure grew to 27.5 per cent among symptomatic patients who were not hospitalised, and to half among those who were. Their most common complaints were pain, breathing difficulties, high cholesterol, fatigue and high blood pressure.

Moreover, these long-haul symptoms are now afflicting more younger people.

A relatively small but increasing percentage of American children has been struggling for months with extreme fatigue, rapid heart rate, memory loss, depression and other symptoms after recovering from Covid-19, Bloomberg reported.

Going by these observations, the world could be in for a far bigger and longer-lasting health crisis if countries do not act urgently to control the spread of the disease when infections occur.

**'Asian' values**

Nonetheless, Asian governments are under increasing pressure to ease restrictions, as recent news spotlights the region's lag in returning to normalcy, and inaction could cause their economies to lose out as others reopen.

On the Bloomberg Covid-19 Resilience Ranking for last month, the Asia-Pacific region - often lauded for its effective handling of its outbreaks - accounted for all seven of the biggest declines in the measure of the best and worst places to be during the pandemic. The US and parts of Europe rose on the ranking as their comparatively higher proportions of vaccination brought down infections and deaths.

However, the ranking - which scores where the pandemic is being handled most effectively, with the least social and economic disruption - assesses economies only at a point in time, and does not take into account the potential costs of any premature opening up.

Ultimately, governments' choices of action are rooted in the cultural traits and values of their people.

""In terms of reopening, whether it is about allowing larger gatherings, lifting mask restrictions, or easing quarantine requirements, we can link a country's public health directives to its cultural values,"" said associate professor of management Umar Ruhi at the University of Ottawa.

He explained this using late Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede's cultural dimensions framework of country-specific differences, in a recent study in the Canadian Health Policy journal.

""To ensure effective citizen participation in (Covid-19) measures, countries need to adopt public health policies and protocols that are aligned with their culture and underlying societal values.""

The dimensions in Professor Hofstede's framework measure nationalities' cultural preferences for individualism versus collectivism; indulgence versus self-restraint; strength of social hierarchy, and uncertainty avoidance, among others.

For example, a national culture that prizes individualism and thus personal freedoms over the collective welfare of the people - like in the US - may have been a driving force behind its authorities' decision to allow vaccinated Americans to go without masks.

In comparison, countries like Singapore, whose societies espouse more collectivist values, may place greater emphasis on mask-wearing as individuals' duty to protect others around them.

Meanwhile, a culture that values self-restraint and a longer-term outlook over instant gratification - as Prof Hofstede found in East Asian regions - may explain some Asian governments' greater propensity to prioritise keeping infections low and thus avoid future health implications, over immediate economic imperatives to reopen quickly.

Essentially, it is also about striking a balance, and no one way is necessarily the best as the circumstances differ from place to place.

As Professor K.K. Cheng, director of the Institute of Applied Health Research at the University of Birmingham, pointed out, the scrapping of outdoor mask mandates in some countries makes sense, as ""the risk of transmission outdoors is much lower; though most places in Singapore would be densely populated by Western standards, and so the considerations may be different"".

Prof Fukuda also noted that the approach of countries in North America and Europe of heavily emphasising vaccination over social distancing and other preventive measures has worked ""reasonably well"" - but only after the vaccines became available to them, and it came at the cost of multitudes of earlier cases and deaths.

The stark memories of the tragedy and wariness of history repeating itself could have given British leaders pause in a planned lifting of lockdown measures. Britain postponed the move last week by a month as it seeks to contain the spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant and races to get more people vaccinated.

Dr Steven Woolf, director emeritus of the Centre on Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University, told USA Today as he reflected on the more than 600,000 deaths that have occurred in the US since the pandemic began: ""The light at the end of the tunnel is in sight, but it doesn't bring back any of those lives or bring solace to the grieving families.""

**Is Asia really lagging? The Covid-19 pandemic finish line may be farther than we think**

*Other regions appear to have left Asia in the dust in the race to put the pandemic behind us. Time will tell.*

Across the Asia-Pacific, where several countries have witnessed alarming new Covid-19 outbreaks in recent weeks and governments have been forced to reimpose harsh anti-virus restrictions, people are gazing in envy at those on the other side of the globe.

In the United States, fully vaccinated Americans - nearly half the population - are revelling in their newfound freedom. They are hopping onto planes, cramming into stadiums, flocking to malls and hosting celebratory parties to send off a miserable year of having been forced to stay apart. Best of all, they are casting off their masks.

Vaccinated individuals in parts of Europe, like Britain, France and Germany, are also being spared the cumbersome measures that had governed their lives for the past year. No more curfews and social limits, no more uncomfortable Covid-19 tests, and no more travel quarantines for most.

France - with about one in every four people fully vaccinated - is lifting its night-time curfew and outdoor mask mandate for all, even those who have yet to get their shots. Spain, with 30 per cent of the population having completed inoculation, is doing the same.

Why is much of the Asia-Pacific region not yet able to do likewise, despite most of its countries having lower infection and fatality rates than the West?

After all, some Asia-Pacific vaccination front runners are doing as well as - or even better than - their Western counterparts.

More than a third of the people in Singapore are already fully vaccinated. Elsewhere in the region, some are lagging behind with their second doses, but 20 per cent to 30 per cent of those in South Korea, Hong Kong, Macau and Australia have received at least one shot.

And judging by the total number of doses administered in China, at least one in three of its people should have had a first jab, if not the second.

The statistics show that vaccination works: Covid-19 deaths in the US - the worst-hit country - have slowed significantly.The death toll in the US topped 600,000 this past week, taking more than four months to add its latest 100,000. This was a stark contrast from the situation back in winter, when it was adding 100,000 deaths in a matter of weeks.

Weekly new hospitalisations - indicating disease severity - have dropped to an all-time low. Daily new cases this month have also fallen to about 7,000 from a peak of more than 300,000 in January.

For some regions in Asia, vaccine accessibility is an issue. Where the life-saving shots cannot be obtained quickly enough in sufficient quantities - as in the cases of Thailand and Vietnam - governments are forced to continue relying on a combination of tight restrictions or border controls.

But even where vaccination is progressing well, some authorities are still keeping social and economic activities on a tether, like in Australia, which is ever ready to lock down entire cities at the emergence of a handful of new local cases.

South Korea took big steps in easing measures last week, scrapping its outdoor mask mandate for those who have had at least their first jab, and allowing up to 4,000 people to attend K-pop concerts.

But with daily new cases bouncing back above 500 and barely 8 per cent of the population fully vaccinated, it remains to be seen if locals and tourists will be in a hurry to flock back to big events and ditch mask-wearing, a practice already widespread in the country before the pandemic.

**Vaccines not a cure-all**

Health policy and management professor Peter Muennig of Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health puts the dichotomy in government approaches down to caution versus recklessness.

""It's not clear quite yet that vaccination and immediate reopening of society thereafter is the way towards ending the pandemic,"" said Professor Muennig, who specialises in analysing the burdens of disease and has written on the health implications associated with different economic systems.

""I would want to see infections drop substantially and vaccination rates with the more effective vaccines - such as the mRNA-based vaccines - climbing above 70 per cent before considering it safe to drop public mask-wearing, (allow) big-group mingling, or resume international travel,"" he said.

""Otherwise, we are just giving the virus a chance to adapt to vaccinated bodies. This is reckless.""

Vaccination alone is not a cure-all. Neither is any other preventive measure, on its own.

Experts like Professor Keiji Fukuda from The University of Hong Kong's School of Public Health point to what has famously been described as the ""Swiss cheese approach"" in countering the pandemic. Each layer of pandemic defence has holes, but when combined, they can block the spread of the virus.

Prof Fukuda said: ""What all countries should strive to have is (1) a stepwise national strategy for opening up; (2) high levels of vaccination, probably in the range of at least 70 per cent; (3) a functional surveillance system capable of detecting an increase in cases; (4) a health system capable of handling a significant increase in cases; and (5) a strong communication initiative that engages the public and private sector.""

Prof Muennig sees China as one key example of having effectively implemented a cautious approach, aided by its strong control over its borders, media messaging and other state apparatus. It has also massively scaled up its vaccination blitz, averaging a whopping 17 million doses daily this past week - almost the total of what South Korea has administered.

""China has really done an outstanding job because the government - and to some extent the people - would rather live with restrictions like electronic monitoring, strict quarantine rules and mandatory testing, than die or suffer lifelong disability,"" Prof Muennig said.

China's robust domestic tourism and consumer markets also make it ""unique in that it can remain economically prosperous with closed borders,"" he added.

The Chinese authorities are not even considering relaxing their travel barriers.

""As long as outbreaks remain uncontrolled outside our borders, it's possible to have them anywhere in China, no matter how long there have been no local cases,"" Dr Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said last month as he justified keeping the country's strict border controls.",,,1624193443,{},h2f95cy,True,t3_o426bi,False,False,t1_h2f7pkm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o426bi/is_asia_really_lagging_the_covid19_pandemic/h2f95cy/,1624501078,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It's been pretty common knowledge ever since the variants first started showing up. Instead of asking a stranger on reddit to do the work of making you aware of the world around you, why not look yourself ? What is it that makes the 30s it took to find very widely dispersed information so difficult?

&gt;For such a drastic acceleration of variant integration, there must have been reinfections. As it turns out, it may have been the driving force. Dr. Faria noted the likelihood that most of the cases observed in P.1‚Äôs spread the past few months were reinfections. This likelihood is derived from antibody effectiveness six times weaker against P.1 in comparison to previous SARS-CoV-2 strains.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Natural infections do not seem to protect against reinfection, yet vaccines remain to be seen.

That article was published on March 10th, 2021. As we've since found out, vaccines are more robust against variants than natural infection. In particular, the mRNA vaccines have had astounding results against variants.

While I can understand the frustration you have with vaccine-refusers in the USA, from a global perspective the much bigger problem is the large unvaccinated population in developing countries, which is like a massive petri dish for the virus to develop new mutations.

If it is true that this new delta+ variant has the same mutation as the beta variant, then that means the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is what has been majorly administered in India so far, might be less effective against it. By now it is very clear that the mRNA vaccines are the most effective by far against preventing the spread of COVID. So I think the most important thing that can be done right now is a massive, coordinated effort to deliver the proven and effective mRNA vaccines to every corner of the globe and vaccinate as many people as possible with it.
