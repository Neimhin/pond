So you're going to refuse an (in your own words) ""innocent vaccine"" just because in the future there will be a slim chance you'll be forced to do something else more sinister? Why stand your ground now for that innocent vaccine that could help yourself and others and not when a sinister demand i actually being made.

Polis noted that a major task now is addressing “hesitance or laziness” for those who didn’t want to endure the digital rush for appointments. Research shows that many of those who have waited to get vaccinated feel they have done so for rational reasons. Maybe they don’t want to lose time at work if they have a bad reaction, or they’ve experienced discrimination while seeking medical care previously.

A relaxed approach was fine when vaccine demand was greater than supply, Polis said. But now vaccines are available to everyone, supply is matching or exceeding demand and the most vulnerable populations have gotten vaccinated. A law signed earlier this year also covered most employees with paid time off or authorized using paid sick leave to get a vaccine and recover from any side effects.

“They’re thinking I’ll get it in the future, maybe in a month, maybe in two months, maybe in some indefinite date,” Polis said. “Well, that time is now.

It is data from a different country (Netherlands), so it is not directly comparable. The youngest age group here is ""under 50"", which is not particularly young, but considered young for severe COVID-19.

First on hospitalisations. If you set the peak of the Dutch winter peak, you can clearly see the trends each age groups are moving compared to an earlier wave without vaccines and variants. Here you can clearly see that the younger age groups are trending differently than older age groups are. Especially the under 50 group is seeing a lot of hospital admissions compared to previous waves. This is probably most due to vaccinations, but some might be due to variants. Most importantly, compare the results with that from earlier in the year/ last year. It is interesting to see a combined wave first, and see it split since March.

But luckily, deaths stayed low. Relatively to previous waves, it only shows figures from above 60. Especially the group 60-69 saw significant increase in deaths, but not on the level of the winter peak. While all other age groups continued to drop. People under 60 were probably not included, as death rates in these groups is extremely low. This is clearly shown in the absolute amounts graph.

[],,LoneWanderer2277,,,[],,,,text,t2_tfzty,False,False,[],"Five reasons why June 21 won’t be the return to normal we thought

Legal powers to impose domestic Covid-19 restrictions have already been extended by Parliament until September

June 21 is burned into the public consciousness as the day when life will finally return to normal and Britain will reach its destination on Boris Johnson’s “one-way road to freedom”.

But there are growing signs that Covid-19 restrictions will remain in place long after the summer solstice.

The Government’s scientific advisers want “baseline measures”, including social distancing, to continue for another year, councils are hiring Covid marshals to start work in July, and vaccine passports are already being trialled.

Meanwhile, legal powers to impose domestic Covid-19 restrictions have been extended by Parliament until September, while international travel restrictions are expected to stay in place for many months.

The Prime Minister insists “the end really is in sight”, but it increasingly seems that may only apply to those who own a telescope.

Social distancing

While the Government is confident that restrictions on meeting friends and family (such as the[ so-called Rule of Six](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/11/20/covid-marshals-giving-yellow-cards-rule-flouters-video-reveals/)) will cease on June 21, it appears increasingly likely that some form of social distancing will stay in place.

Ministers are conducting a review of the '[one metre-plus rule](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/20/one-metre-plus-new-rule-will-reopen-uk/)', which allows restaurant customers, office workers and others to sit one metre apart if mitigations such as screens and extra ventilation are in place.

Pubs have warned that if the one metre-plus rule stays in place, it will be a disaster for them, because they need to be full to make a profit. But hospitality bosses are pessimistic about the possibility of seeing punters crammed shoulder to shoulder at the bar any time soon.

Theatres, cinemas, nightclubs and other venues that rely on full houses to turn a profit are also anxiously awaiting the results of the government review.

Data from indoor trial events such as the [World Snooker Championship](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/20/one-metre-plus-new-rule-will-reopen-uk/), the Luna Cinema in Liverpool and the Circus Nightclub, also in Liverpool, will be analysed before any decision is made on social distancing.

A second phase of pilots will only begin at the end of May, meaning the results are unlikely to be known in time for June 21.

Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said: ""Unless the Government lifts restrictions in full our businesses will remain unviable because they will not be able to make a profit. The question for ministers is, do they give the economy long Covid by keeping some restrictions in place?""

Sporting events

The first major sporting event to take place after June 21 will be the Wimbledon tennis tournament, which starts on June 28, but its organisers have warned the public that it will be a far cry from business as usual.

On Tuesday, the All England Club’s chairman Ian Hewitt said crowds could be restricted to just 25 per cent of capacity, while players will have to stay in bio-secure hotels and will face fines of £14,000 if they breach Covid-19 security rules.

Mr Hewitt said: “We plan to deliver the best Championships possible in accordance with public safety. It will necessarily be different from Wimbledon as we know it.”

Football’s FA Cup final on May 15 will take place in front of just 20,000 fans, instead of Wembley’s 90,000 capacity, meaning trials of outdoor sporting events will still be at an early stage by June 21.

Covid Marshals

If all legal restrictions are lifted on June 21, the one thing the country surely will not need from then on is Covid Marshals.

Yet, councils around the country are advertising jobs for [Covid Marshals](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/11/20/covid-marshals-giving-yellow-cards-rule-flouters-video-reveals/) that do not start until July and will continue until next year.

They include Hertfordshire County Council, which has advertised a £3 million contract for 60 Covid Marshals to start work on July 1 through to Jan 31 next year, with a possible extension of up to one year, meaning they could be in place until 2023.

Their job will be to “aid and encourage compliance” and to help the public and businesses “understand regulations and guidance”.

The council says that it is planning for a possible third wave and it would be a “dereliction of duty” not to have marshals in place as part of their preparations for such an eventuality.

It also insisted that the recruitment of more Covid Marshals “is not indicative of any increases in restrictions from July 2021 onwards”.

The marshals do not have enforcement powers, and how the public reacts to being challenged by them after legal restrictions have lapsed remains to be seen.

Vaccine passports and test for entry

The Government’s pilots of indoor and outdoor events rely on Covid-19 status certification to allow crowds to return to sport and customers to return to restaurants, theatres and nightclubs.

Early pilots of the so-called Events Research Programme are relying on pre-entry testing alone, while later pilots, starting at the end of next month, will attempt to incorporate data on vaccination and acquired immunity, so in other words, vaccine passports.

The Government has also said it is “committed to explore whether and how Covid-status certification might be used to reopen our economy”, which “could allow some freedoms to be restored more safely”.

It believes certificates “could have an important role to play both domestically and internationally as a temporary measure”.

Official guidance to businesses such as pubs and restaurants states that “even without Government intervention, Covid-status certification is likely to become a feature of our lives until the threat from the pandemic recedes”.

Ministers are reluctant to ban businesses from requiring customers to demonstrate their Covid-19 status, meaning vaccine passports and test for entry are likely to be a feature of everyday life for some time to come.

Face coverings

The most visible proof that restrictions are over will come when face coverings are finally consigned to history, but that is unlikely to happen on June 21.

Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has stated publicly that he expects face coverings to be necessary next winter, and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) believes “baseline measures” such as mask wearing and social distancing might be necessary “throughout winter 2021/22”.

The use of face coverings is also the subject of a review.

Regardless of whether it recommends that masks should be worn in crowded spaces such as train carriages, it seems likely that the public will either be advised to wear them, or will choose to do so, as the gradual return to normality leads to an increase in commuting, shopping and tightly-packed audiences.",,,1619601728,{},gw5j83n,True,t3_n0aviz,False,True,t3_n0aviz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n0aviz/uk_five_reasons_why_june_21_wont_be_the_return_to/gw5j83n/,1619614368,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; The EU contract is based on an “estimated time schedule”, full stop. In the British contract by contrast, there is a precisely described procedure to guarantee a timely delivery of doses. This procedure is based on a “preliminary calendar” (with five delivery dates and volumes). AstraZeneca is obliged to notify to the UK authorities ultimately 30 days in advance the details of each of these deliveries. Once notified, AstraZeneca can no longer escape these precise commitments without permission of the UK authorities. Only a minor variance of dates (up to 5 business days) compared to the delivery schedule is possible due to the “unpredictable nature of the manufacturing of the products”, the so called “grace period”. All this is not foreseen in the EU agreement.

Vaccination levels are very low, running at about 11% for adults with a single dose. So not even complete vaccination, this is about 2.5% of the population. 

The difference is they are fighting the same contagious strain as the UK did, but without the infrastructure to support them. 

The hospitals in the UK came very close to catastrophe and similar outcomes we are seeing now in India. Only averted by severe lockdown, just in time. And this is in a country with good medical infrastructure. 

It’s been shown that outdoor transmission is low so I doubt the rallies and religious meets are driving this hugely. What will be driving it is the new variant that is so much more contagious in infecting whole families. With India having more people living together in close proximity, can’t have helped. 

This combined with the lack of medical support shown to have the best outcomes in early intervention. Once a person is turning blue and not receiving O2 therapy the outcomes even with ventilation are poor.

There is no country in the world where one can unilaterally decide not to abide by the laws and rules of the land, without suffering some sort of punishment. True freedom does not exist anywhere, and liberty implies restraint. What liberties are to be taken away is agreed upon by the populace.

You can simply move to a place where there isn't a mask mandate if that is so important to you. However, if you choose to stay, you should follow the majority consensus of where you are, as embodied in the local governor's decree.

[],,spectrumero,,,[],,,,text,t2_bg1wh,False,False,[],"It's absolutely how the number for ""yesterday's COVID deaths"" is reported.

The UK reports the immediate figures literally as **people who have died within 28 days of a positive COVID test**. Exactly that, no more no less. Any number you see on Worldometer, or in the newspapers, or bandied about by someone about ""deaths yesterday"" will be this number. The death certificate isn't available for 11 to 14 days, so a post like this one (or a newspaper article, or other news source) which says ""X people died **yesterday** from COVID"" in the UK comes from this figure. The figure you see on Worldometer is from people who died of any cause within 28 days of a COVID test.

This was newsworthy in the UK during the first wave, because back then the UK was reporting deaths after a positive COVID test regardless of how long ago the test was (e.g. people who died 70 days after a positive COVID test were being counted as a COVID death even though they almost certainly died of some other cause); they ended up having to reduce the death count by thousands because there were too many non-COVID deaths being counted. The UK now publishes two figures: the one for *yesterday*, which gets reported in the press and shows up on Worldometer which is people who died within 28 days of a positive test, and another one which lags by about 14 days for those with COVID on the death certificate - which everyone ignores, because information from 11-14 days ago doesn't interest the press very much.

The method of reporting the immediate figure as anyone who died within 28 days of a positive test is, by the way, entirely reasonable when the death rate is ~100 per 100,000 infected. Very few of those numbers would be from some cause other than COVID. When the death rate from COVID has fallen to ~10 per 100,000 infected because of vaccination, then the ""deaths yesterday"" figure will not be as accurate by this method.",,,1619598246,{},gw5fo0f,False,t3_mzfwcj,False,True,t1_gw3y837,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mzfwcj/uk_records_2064_new_covid_cases_6_deaths/gw5fo0f/,1619612222,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

From the article:

&gt; Like his friends, Dr. Wollowitz was vaccinated in January. But he did not produce any antibodies in response — nor did he expect to. He is one of millions of Americans who are immunocompromised, whose bodies cannot learn to deploy immune fighters against the virus.

&gt; Some immunocompromised people were born with absent or faulty immune systems, while others, like Dr. Wollowitz, have diseases or have received therapies that wiped out their immune defenses. Many of them produce few to no antibodies in response to a vaccine or an infection, leaving them susceptible to the virus. When they do become infected, they may suffer prolonged illness, with death rates as high as 55 percent.

&gt;Most people who have lived with immune deficiencies for a long time are likely to be aware of their vulnerability. But others have no idea that medications may have put them at risk.

&gt;“They’ll be walking around outside thinking they’re protected — but maybe they’re not,” said Dr. Lee Greenberger, chief scientific officer of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, which funds research on blood cancers.

India has a population of 1 billion.

Survival rate is 99%

Without any lockdown, you can anticipate 10 million dead.  A disaster of unprecedented proportions.  With lockdowns similar to the US, you can reduce that tenfold.  Excess deaths in the US for 2020 is around 12%.  India sees around 10 million dead annually (7.3 per 1,000).  With lockdowns, you drop the deaths to 1 million.

So absolute terms 200k vs 9 million.  Brutal math but that is what is at stake.

Now, here is the kicker.  The 99% survival is weighted across all demographics.  It also assumes a robust infrastructure to treat everyone.  With an explosion in cases due to no lokdown, even a 1% increase in mortality to 98% sees another 10 million dead.

And that's just deaths from covid.  Didn't even touch that caregivers are heavily impacted.  So, let's guess that for every 4 deaths, (mom/dad/2 granndparents) 1 child becomes an orphan.  Without lockdown at 99%, 2 million orphans.  And how well will the social system support that many more?   Not well.

So, 200k dead vs 9 million dead with 2 million orphans.  Suddenly a lockdown doesn't look bad.

If we get more realistic and move the death rate to 95% due to a collapsed infrastructure, that's 45 million dead and 10 million orphans.

My wife (39) and I (37) have a chance to get the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine here in Taiwan before we immigrate to the US. But when we arrive in the US (5 weeks after getting this first dose of AZ), we won't be able to get the second dose of that brand of vaccine. Is it harmful or risky to start a new vaccine when we arrive? The only reason we'd get the AstraZeneca here is to lower the risk of getting COVID-19 while traveling, and to stop us from infecting anybody who inevitably helps us get settled. From what I've read, getting one dose of any vaccine significantly lowers risk, even though it's technically only a primer for the second dose, which provides more resistance to infection. My concern is that getting a total of three doses (one of the AZ, two of another in the US) might be somehow bad for us. I called the department of health in the US state where I'll be living, and they said not to get the first dose here. But my friend, a doctor, saw no problem with it.

Better to be more cautious.

There's also the social aspect. If you see a bunch of people walking around maskless, chances are you'll ditch the mask too even if you're unvaccinated, thus contributing to the problem of a potential outbreak if you're asymptomatic but carrying the virus yourself.

 The chief minister of the Uttar Pradesh state of India declared that people spreading ""misinformation"" regarding oxygen will be punished. This covers cases where hospitals both government and private as well as individuals will be punished for requesting O2.  


As an example,  a youth who sought Oxygen for his grandfather via tweet was named in a [criminal case for spreading rumor and panic in society](https://thewire.in/government/amethi-up-police-arfa-khanum-sherwani-oxygen-smriti-irani)[ by the UP Police](https://thewire.in/government/amethi-up-police-arfa-khanum-sherwani-oxygen-smriti-irani)

In this state, the hospitals are in dire need of O2 and there is a flourishing black market of oxygen and medicines like remdesivir. Almost all hospitals in the state capital are asking for patients to come with their own arrangements for O2. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, for admission to hospital, there are long bureaucratic hurdles to keep the numbers low. This goes in tandem with restricted testing. Some patients are arranging of Oxygen from smaller cities 100s to kilometers away before approaching to hospital for a bed.

&amp;#x200B;

While this is going on, [local body elections](https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/up-panchayat-election-2021-phase-3-polls-live-updates-polling-for-gram-panchayat-block-zila-panchayats-in-20-districts-3-52-lakh-candidates/2240145/) are still running. These will conclude on 29th April. These elections are to elect the representatives in the villages, the lowest level of governance in India. Thousands of villages are voting, with which Corona is moving to the smaller localities. Many of the voters in the earlier phase of elections are now sick.

&amp;#x200B;

And, the deaths. The government is hiding death figures in innovative ways. Restricted testing to limit positive cases, followed by no availability of beds for treatment, lack of O2 is causing a lot of deaths.

Deaths due to comorbidities are not included even if tested positive or if negative if all the symptoms lead to covid. As a result, a factor of over 10 is usually found between the actual cremations and the reported data. In the end, when the cremation number started to appear, the government started putting up [barricades and metal sheets](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tin-walls-set-up-to-block-view-of-cremation-site-in-lucknow-101618497854096.html) around the cremation ground to prevent onlookers and camera.

For now, the number of cases and effective transmission rate matter too. Unmasked, unrestricted vaccinated individuals would be expected to be infected 90-95% less than unmasked, unrestricted, unvaccinated individuals. How much would that be? We don't know, as we only have the data for masked, restricted, unvaccinated individuals. It's a judgment call on where we would be without restrictions, and if 90-95% less than that is ok. 

For now, the professionals are saying that even that spread would be too high. For now, the main point of the vaccine is protection from death, hospitalization and illness. 

You may disagree - I do somewhat disagree, I think it would be okay to lift some or most restrictions from the vaccinated, although the practical problems of vaccine passports and cheating might be big enough that it's just easier to wait, as it may well be just weeks before we are at the situation where restrictions are not needed for anyone.

That means that, in a situation where you are exposed to Covid, someone who is vaccinated has about 5%-10% the chance of getting sick as someone who is not vaccinated.  That's pretty good, but not zero.

When enough people are vaccinated, Covid can't infect often enough to maintain its infection rate, and it disappears.  At that point, *everyone's* chance of infection is 0%, because there is no one to catch it *from* -- the same way that no one in the U.S. gets Polio, even though Polio vaccines aren't 100% protective either.

&gt; “We have reviewed and support the CDC’s new masking recommendations and are working quickly to align California’s guidance with these common sense updates,” Dr. Tomás Aragón, director of the California Department of Public Health, said in a statement from the agency.

&gt; In a tweet announcing the news, Gov. Gavin Newsom applauded the state for managing to have the lowest test positivity rate and case rate in the entire country. Last week, only Hawaii beat the state in holding the lowest such statistics. But that changed this week as Hawaii’s test positivity and case rates inched upward in recent days while California’s have continued to decline.

&gt; Currently, the state has a test positivity rate of 1.2% and 33 new daily cases per 100,000 people. By comparison, the total nationwide case rate is 116.4 cases per 100,000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

&gt; Los Angeles County will also update its own guidelines to align with new state and federal rules allowing vaccinated residents to go mask-free in most outdoor settings. The county joined federal health officials in still recommending facial coverings when keeping six feet apart is not possible.

&gt; Health officials have also warned that if people who are unvaccinated start to not wear masks, it could put the rest of the population at risk.

I’d guess this goes some way to explaining to people who didn’t realise this why both J&amp;J and AZ have had production issues - it is new tech as well and it seems particularly difficult to scale these first times around.

Roughly speaking mRNA vaccines use mRNA to instruct cells to produce the covid spike proteins which the body then has an immune response to. Viral vectors use a different, harmless virus as a vector to get DNA into the body, with the same goal producing those spike proteins. In a way at the “business end” they are all similar.

The good news is data from the U.K. has shown that after one dose, both the Pfizer and AZ vaccine show similar real-world results in terms of effectiveness. The dosing strategy of the U.K. means it remains to be seen how the effectiveness compared both doses, however,  the strategy has worked very well as the majority of protection is afforded after that first dose.

People in Brazil have plenty of time off, and long lunch hours, and they have no qualms about extending it for any reason they can think of, so ""vaccination day"" would be an easy sell.  They aren't going to get fired or told they can't go because someone has to the work the cash registers, they're just gone.

Finally, there are none of those pesky privacy laws in Brazil.   So they'll just call you up by whatever information they feel like.   John Smith, your proctologist is available in Room C!   No qualms about doing that.

Saying EU is banning exports like that is misleading. Yes, EU has technically blocked some exports, but only for one specific vaccine from one specific company that is hugely behind schedule for domestic deliveries. Exports to poor countries (COVAX) and exports of other vaccines are completely exempt as well.

EU has exported over 100M doses, and that is not even including doses sent to COVAX, Israel and some other countries. EU is only second to China when it comes to exports, so saying ""EU is banning exports"" without clarifying further is misleading.

&gt; Unlike the EU and US, the UK had no vaccine manufacturing capability at all before the pandemic, so when it built a few AZ factories specifically for the pandemic, it stipulated in the contract that it should serve the UK first, but that's just common sense if you're directly paying for your own factories from scratch, so I don't see how any reasonable person could argue with that.

Totally agree and it seems that a large subset of the population has completely forgotten this.   Preventing healthcare system collapse, and the collateral damage that accompanies it, has always been the primary goal of these efforts.  Protecting the vulnerable population (65+ or comorbidities like obesity, CVD, and diabetes) has always been the secondary goal (and one that supports the primary goal).  Eliminating all transmission of the virus has never been the goal, never will be the goal, and is wholly unrealistic and unattainable.  

We are on track for 65-70% of the 16+ population to be vaccinated by the end of May, and when you combine this with the % of the population that has natural immunity from prior infection, a likely 85-90% vaccination rate of the most vulnerable population by then, and the fact that Covid is not a serious problem for &lt;16 year olds, that is almost certainly ""good enough"" to re-open at that point.  Of course, we should continue to expand vaccination efforts beyond that and those most at-risk should continue to take precautions.

\&gt;It is one of three factories that The Associated Press found on three continents whose owners say they could start producing hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccines on short notice if only they had the blueprints and technical know-how. But that knowledge belongs to the large pharmaceutical companies who have produced the first three vaccines authorized by countries including Britain, the European Union and the U.S. — Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. The factories are all still awaiting responses.

Across Africa and Southeast Asia, governments and aid groups, as well as the World Health Organization, are calling on pharmaceutical companies to share their patent information more broadly to meet a [yawning global shortfall](https://apnews.com/article/europe-immunizations-coronavirus-pandemic-united-nations-611ca364df6235099be95548c3c22c4d) in a pandemic that already has claimed over [2.5 million lives](https://apnews.com/article/gobal-death-toll-coronavirus-2-million-19c7f4611df0a8635ebb83f833c7b89f). Pharmaceutical companies that took taxpayer money from the U.S. or Europe to develop inoculations at unprecedented speed say they are negotiating contracts and exclusive licensing deals with producers on a case-by-case basis because they need to protect their intellectual property and ensure safety.

Critics say this piecemeal approach is too slow at a time of urgent need to stop the virus before it mutates into even deadlier forms. WHO called for vaccine manufacturers to share their know-how to “dramatically increase the global supply.”

All over the world, the supply of coronavirus vaccines is falling far short of demand, and the [limited amount available ](https://apnews.com/article/poorer-countries-coronavirus-vaccine-0980fa905b6e1ce2f14a149cd2c438cd)is going to rich countries. Nearly 80% of the vaccines so far have been administered in just 10 countries, according to WHO. More than 210 countries and territories with 2.5 billion people hadn’t received a single shot as of last week.

The deal-by-deal approach also means that [some poorer countries end up paying more ](https://apnews.com/article/business-honduras-coronavirus-vaccine-coronavirus-pandemic-central-america-16d7d06f031c89aaf37a4306747b9128)for the same vaccine than richer countries. South Africa, Mexico, Brazil and Uganda all pay different amounts per dose for the AstraZeneca vaccine — and more than governments in the European Union, according to studies and publicly available documents. AstraZeneca said the price of the vaccine will differ depending on local production costs and how much countries order.

“What we see today is a stampede, a survival of the fittest approach, where those with the deepest pockets, with the sharpest elbows are grabbing what is there and leaving others to die,”

In South Africa, home to the world’s [most worrisome COVID-19 variant](https://apnews.com/article/us-news-anthony-fauci-infectious-diseases-coronavirus-pandemic-6839fde8261b404ef995c682017b5a84), the Biovac factory has said for weeks that it’s in negotiations with an unnamed manufacturer with no contract to show for it. And in Denmark, the Bavarian Nordic factory has capacity to spare and the ability to make more than 200 million doses but is also waiting for word from the producer of a licensed coronavirus vaccine.

Governments and health experts offer two potential solutions to the vaccine shortage: One, supported by WHO, is a patent pool modeled after a platform set up for HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis treatments for voluntary sharing of technology, intellectual property and data. But no company has offered to share its data.

The other, [a proposal to suspend intellectual property rights](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-technology-global-trade-international-agreements-india-c65a718f35f40cb50402f67018efb8e5) during the pandemic, has been blocked in the World Trade Organization by the United States and Europe, home to the companies responsible for creating coronavirus vaccines. That drive has the support of at least 119 countries and the African Union but is adamantly opposed by vaccine makers.

Advocates of sharing vaccine blueprints argue that, unlike with most drugs, taxpayers paid billions to develop vaccines that could help end the world’s biggest public health emergency in living memory.

“People are literally dying because we cannot agree on intellectual property rights,” said Mustaqeem De Gama, a South African diplomat involved in the WTO discussions.

Paul Fehlner, the chief legal officer for biotech company Axcella and a supporter of the WHO patent pool board, said governments that poured billions of dollars into developing vaccines and treatments should have demanded more from the companies they were financing from the beginning.

“A condition of taking taxpayer money is not treating them as dupes,” he said.

IMO, vaccines have a % of efficiency (different for each vaccine and for each variant), and they should cohesist with other measures (like masks). And by the way, yes, there are different types of masks, with different efficiencies. (not the same to use a cloth, a surgical mask or a KN95)

IMO there are really only two impediments to vaccine uptake that are both meaningful and solvable.

Some people hesitate because they want to see others go first. If everyone around them has been vaccinated and no one's grown a third arm, they'll get onboard too. Normalization through high numbers = in progress.

The other impediment is that finger-waving, nanny state messaging: ""Don't think you can go back to normal just because you got vaccinated! Make long term friends with your mask!"" Put that garbage six feet under where it belongs and watch wonderful things happen to uptake among the vaccine-hesitant, especially younger people.

Your mistake here is to give people information on when to mask which is faulty.  That only leads to people making wrong interpretations of that information which cannot be controlled.

You can look at studies of what each country did and the only practical way was to wear a mask at all times when not at home with your household, by yourself not in public or or in your car.  The fact that the vast majority of people live near other people and it was just good practice to wear a mask all the time even when walking in your neighborhood.  Because letting everyone decide how to interpret the guidance on the fly got us to hundreds of thousands of dead people.

There was no downside to going all in as a nation on full mask use like other countries that did, where it was socially and sometimes legally unacceptable to not wear a mask when out and about.

Getting hung up on science differences between how infectious it is between all the scenarios drastically ignores the science of society and behavior of people as statistics.

If you argue that you don't need a mask to go to the beach you are just anti mask.  Yes the beach is safer but the bathrooms aren't, the food vendors arn't, the entrances arn't.  The societal pressure to be social and not being one of the minority with a mask is measurable.  I doubt many people got covid sitting maskless by themselves on a beach socially distant but plenty of got covid and spread out around after going to the beach.

So why argue that masks were not needed to go to the beach and socially distance knowing that as a group it's going to spread covid and use that information, often poorly, to make other judgments on what's safe.  When other side of that coin is one piece of information that can't kill people, ""wear a mask in public."" It works because it's simple and even when mis interrupted you just have extra mask use which has no downside unless you are anti mask and think that wearing them is harmful somehow.",,,1619627991,{},gw6ujms,False,t3_n0713w,False,True,t1_gw6c41o,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n0713w/california_and_la_county_will_allow_fully/gw6ujms/,1619645347,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;In November and December, the variant started spreading in Manaus. So, all the flights leaving Manaus were possibly carrying infected passengers to many places in Brazil and the world. Even after the scientists detected the problem, Brazil’s government didn’t cancel flights. Many patients and family members were transferred to other cities in Brazil for treatment, and flights continued. **The variant was spreading, bit by bit, and taking over.**

We had an increase of gatherings at the end of the year. By January and February, P.1 had spread all over Brazil. In March, [the variant spread] in a synchronized way: All [Brazilian] states had high transmission rates at the same time. **P.1 is up to 2.4 times more transmissible, in comparison to the first wave of infections(B117).** It’s not possible yet to compare P.1 and the other two variants [from Kent and South Africa].

I am in Pasco, Florida. We have already had 1 death from P1. We have over 68% B117 at this time. The spread echoes Brazil in every way. We have no mandates or lockdown/rollback measures. We have a simple recommendation to wear masks indoors in public places. We used to have pretty uniform mask wearing with 5 or 6% non-mask wearers. Now we're facing 50% non-mask wearers. Of those 50% who wear masks, 25% are wearing them incorrectly (nose exposed, inadequate fit, or pulling mask down to speak), wearing useless masks or thin masks (handkerchiefs, gators, thin surgical masks, or masks that are made of foam). So we're left with perhaps 25% wearing masks correctly. If 75% of our population is at risk - minus the vaccinated individuals, there is still a significant portion of individuals capable of spreading P1. I have noted significant travel on trips for vacations, family outings, camping, tourism, and barbecues. This continuous lack of adherence to CDC guidelines coupled with elation and socializing at getting vaccinated (socializing unmasked before full immunization) has caused multiple breakthrough cases, repeat infections (I have seen the same people 2 and 3 times in this year) and community spread of each and every variant.

The baseline data does show that nearly all vaccinated persons do not have severe cases or hospitalization. We would expect as vaccination rolls out that even if cases go up that hospitalization will go down over time. As we loosen restrictions, yes, cases will likely go up among unvaccinated people who do not take precautions, but we would expect relatively few cases of COVID-19  or transmission among vaccinated persons. Prevention was not the end point for vaccination, reducing severe cases was.

We would expect rate of infection would be dependent on the behavior of susceptible persons (e.g. unvaccinated persons who have never been infected) and number of susceptible people left. If there are very few people susceptible because there is high vaccination rates, we would potentially see rate of infection go close to 0 due to herd immunity.

Here's why: The next hearing will be on May 26. A decision is expected 'in June'.

And we are only talking about extra doses from AZ due to the lawsuit, it's not that AZ will stop deliveries completely (well - you never know). On top, most EU member states will already vaccinate younger age groups, possibly while the infection rates are very low. Not the ideal playing field for Vaxzevria...

The vast majority of that time is spent garnering funding, going through administrative red tape at regulatory agencies, and enrolling trials. Due to the widespread urgency of this particular vaccine, these hurdles were largely eliminated and allowed for the same rigorous clinical trials to be performed without sacrificing any of their effectiveness. Additionally, the groundwork for these vaccines has been in development for decades and given the early sequencing of the virus' genome, pharmaceutical companies were able to get a head start on development before the disease was even widespread. Finally, clinical trials generally take longer because you have to wait for a certain number of people in the trial to actually contract the disease - since COVID is currently a pandemic and it is very easy to catch, this made the trials faster.
2. Viruses do mutate, but all of our current vaccines are effective against the new variants and antibody response is not the only factor in immune response. Even if efficacy against disease is decreased, prevention of death remains intact (which is the top priority).
3. Simply not true. mRNA vaccines do not and cannot interact with DNA in any way. mRNA is naturally produced by cells as a set of instructions to make protein. mRNA is temporary and represents the instructions for a protein, and the mRNA breaks down soon after the protein is produced. The way the vaccines work is by injecting such instructions, which causes the cells to create a small piece of the virus (meaning you cannot get COVID from it) and promptly fight it off. mRNA never enters the cell nucleus (naturally or when injected) and there is no mechanism for it to alter DNA. Besides, most of the available vaccines do not use mRNA technology, so even though there is no concern about gene alteration for mRNA vaccines, there are traditional vaccines available as well.",,,1619632478,{},gw75et4,False,t3_n092bb,False,False,t1_gw74ahd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n092bb/daily_discussion_thread_april_28_2021/gw75et4/,1619651578,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It wouldn't have had to be that long.

But given that so many people are vapid and self centered it has been.

However, the war is not over, as we still need a substantially higher percentage to be vaccinated before we can declare total victory.

I understand the majority of people were doing more socializing and such than what vaccinated me is doing now to begin with, so of course to them it feels like there is no point. They're selfish and never really cared anyway, so of course all they can see here is ""I'm not gonna get it because it doesn't give me alone what I want right away"" .

I used to listen to that podcast quite a bit but was tapering off a lot before it went over to spotify (which killed it to for me entirely). I felt like there was a fair amount of honest discussion and points were brought up that I wouldn't think of myself. There was also plenty of stuff I completely disagree with. There's also a ton of banter and half cocked joke ideas. I don't listen anymore so really don't know or care how this particular podcast went. The real problem is that people are so devoid of the ability to think critically that they can't evaluate a statement, it's context, and whether it's coming from a place primarily of opinion vs research etc. If it is given as actual advice, does it actually make sense? Who are the guests? Are they experts, what credentials do they have, who do they work for, are they bro-ing it up by bullshitting/bantering on a podcast or are they seriously describing their field of study? Are they trying to make themselves look good? Etc etc. If Joe Rogan (or anyone else, expert or otherwise) looks you in the eyes and seriously tells you something like ""Cigarettes aren't bad for you, it's all government propaganda"", I would hope you have enough going on in your head to think to yourself ""hey, that probably isn't right"". Maybe don't live your life by that advice just yet.

This is true of people who both love and hate this podcast. There were plenty of instances where something was said that people heavily criticized that were clearly off the cuff remarks or jokes. There's also things that were said with authority and under the guise of expertise that were flat out incorrect or misinformed. Taking a celebrity as the end all of where you get advice from is a terrible idea.

I hardly see anybody wearing a mask outdoors. However I do see most people wearing them inside businesses. The most common sight is people walking up to a store or a building with no mask, putting it on right before entering, and taking it off immediately after exiting. 

So from that point of view, the new recommendations seem....well, pointless. Especially since it seems to focus on fully vaccinated people. I mean if you are fully vaccinated and the recommendation is that you *still* wear a mask indoors, then many people are going to wonder what the point of the vaccine was in the first place.

I mean I get it, a vaccination doesn't guarantee you don't catch or possibly spread Covid. But since most people (down here at least) aren't wearing a mask outdoors. Then why bother?  I have my first Pfizer shot, I'm still not vaccinated. In a few weeks I will have my second shot and according to the studies, I will be somewhere in the 90% protection area. Two weeks after the second shot, the chances are very slim. I will continue to wear a mask inside businesses because they still require them. I won't become an ""anti-masker"" because I'm vaccinated. Businesses have guidelines, I follow them. But there is no chance I wear one outside and once the indoor restrictions are lifted I'm not wearing one. At some point vaccinated people need to return to normal life.

Not really. With the hindsight of British vaccine nationalism yes. But disregarding that, AZ production could be fully based in the UK for all I care - as long as production shortfalls were shared and doses exported to the EU as reliably as Pfizer the other way around.

&gt;and the EU had blocked all exports to the UK to inflict maximise death and destruction upon the population.

No, just no. That's crazy and nothing I said hints even remotely at that. Nor do I secretly think so. If the tables were turned regarding AZ production and vaccine rollout, I'd like to think the EU would've allowed exports to the UK long ago, and I'd support that. I might well be smug about it on reddit, but that's besides the point. Actions speak louder than words.

&gt;You're obviously not concerned with cooperation and parity or you wouldn't be staying up all night getting angrier and angrier

You'd be surprised what else I can escalate over the course of a night 😅 Seriously though, are you really surprised that people get angry at AZ or whatever role the UK has possibly played in its underperformance for the EU?

&gt;about the fact that the UK didn't hand over all of it's meagre production at a time when the UK deaths were still higher than the EU ones.

Nobody has ever talked of handing over *all* production. I said sharing. And ofc that would've taken the pandemic situation on both sides of the channel into consideration. So yeah more deaths in infections in the UK had been a good case to say ""sorry not rn, but when the reach this or that threshold"". Or limit epxorts to the hardest hit EU members at the time like Portugal, which was suffering at least as much as the UK back then IIRC. I kow that UK production ain't much, so not much could be shared, but anything had been better than nothing and flipping the finger from the start which is how it came across to me at least.

That might also explain the harsh reactions from the EU. I don't support everything they said or how they handled it in general, but in my memory at least (might be biased) the UK first froze off requests for exports, and then the commission's tone got more and more shrill. Either way I don't think VDL et al. would've portrayed exports as a victory over perfidious Albion or somesuch. It's possible but not likely. Maybe you think too much like your gutter press here... At worst I'd rather imagine them phrasing it as something like ""rightfully getting what's ours"", which has it's own problems, but it does not deny the gesture of solidarity either. VDL &amp; Macron aren't oblivious to how tough a sell this had been for Johnson.

And sorry I didn't get your inferiority point from the last paragraph (sounded quite angry yourself there tbh), you might wanna explain this again to a slow reader, preferably this time in a way that doesn't get your comment deleted by the mods ;) Or answer to another of my comments over at r/europe they're more liberal regarding language.

I think this and my other comment that you replied to answers most of your above comment. I totally understand the fears over no domestic supply chain, it's just sad and ironic that in safeguarding against those risks the UK has arguably done what it feared others might do it, thus becoming part of the problem IMHO. Looking at how things unfolded, it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy. I can't guarantee that the EU had never banned exports to the UK as you described, but to me it's not realistic at all. Cue continued Pfizer exports, over 100m doses of various vaccines altogether to dozens of countries even at the height of the third wave here, and Norway's also not in the EU but doesn't get shorted. If Pfizer suffered shortfalls (as it did earlier this year) then every customer of this supply chain misses out afaik.

I would say he is yet to be proven wrong, and we have a whole spring and summer to see how everything plays out. As a healthcare worker myself I can tell you the burnout is very real among all levels of staff because of what the pandemic is continuing to do to people on the front lines. I think it's important to remember that while you may be enjoying a margarita on the beach after being vaccinated, if enough people don't get the jab then it can still overwhelm the nation's health systems. It doesn't take that many people out of any given population for an ICU to hit capacity and ambulances to be denied admission of patients. The hospitalizations are the most significant part of what defines it being a ""Category 5"" or not. As we speak they are still steadily rising, with the young making up a greater portion than before. They also seem to be a demographic that is vaccine avoidant. We aren't out of the woods yet. At the same time, that doesn't mean we need to make the same sacrifices we did before now that many of us are vaccinated. It is a strange in-between stage we reside in and admittedly it is difficult to parse out what is the correct way to perceive the situation thanks to what I consider to be poor messaging on guidelines and why they are made the way they are. Some major cities closed beaches, even though now we know - especially with the CDC guidance made today - that is one of the safest activities you can go and do during the pandemic.

You think having contracts which gives a country first supply is nationalism and is immoral. 

You indirectly claim the EU does have morales because it didn't have these contracts which gave it priority over AZ vaccine.

But you imply the EU will do it because the US and UK did have that and that the UK and US are immoral. So ultimately your so flaky and the morales your throw in others faces don't mean shit. Your a hypocrit! You don't mind the EU doing something you consider immoral.

Truth is the EU doesn't have these morales you claim they have and messed up with the contracts.

Fauci was speaking to reporters during a conference call on Tuesday.""This is something where we're still gaining data on a daily basis. But the most recent data, was looking at convalescent Sera of Covid-19 cases and people who received the vaccine used in India, the Covaxin. It was found to neutralise the 617 variants,"" he said.""So, despite the real difficulty that we're seeing in India, vaccination could be a very, very important antidote against this,"" Fauci added.The New York Times on Tuesday said Covaxin works by teaching the immune system to make antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. 

The antibodies attach to viral proteins, such as the so-called spike proteins that stud its surface.Developed by Bharat Biotech in partnership with National Institute of Virology and the Indian Council of Medical Research, Covaxin was approved for emergency use on January 3. Trial results later showed the vaccine has an efficacy of 78 per cent.

Responding to a question, Dr Andy Slavitt, White House Covid-19 Response Senior Advisor, said that a strike team from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention is headed over to India to help coordinate this response.

""We are making sure that we are locating some of the raw materials necessary to create more vaccines in India, which I think is going to be an important help there,"" he said.

""We stand with the country of India during this very trying and tragic surge. We are working to deploy resources and supplies, including therapeutics, rapid testing kits, ventilators, PPE, and raw materials, that are needed to manufacture vaccines in India, and the CDC, which has a long history of working with and in India on public health measures, will be deploying a strike team to the country to support the public health efforts there,"" Slavitt said.Given the strong portfolio of approved, highly effective and safe vaccines here in the United States, the administration is looking at options to share AstraZeneca vaccines with other countries as they become available.This should amount to around 60 million doses or so over the next two months, he added.""The AstraZeneca vaccine is highly safe and effective, and approved in many parts of the world, and since it is not approved for use in the US, we do not need to use the AstraZeneca vaccine here during the next few months,"" Slavitt said.""We have sufficient supply of vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson &amp; Johnson to accommodate our needs in the US,"" he added.",,,1619588966,{},gw54w8m,True,t3_n077ph,False,False,t1_gw533gy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n077ph/indias_covaxin_found_to_neutralise_617_variant_of/gw54w8m/,1619606027,22,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,

Me being 5+ weeks post-2nd shot &amp; 2 week waiting period: HELLZ YEAH!!!

Me working for a household name retail private company: I'm about to have a *horrible* few weeks

My store had an outbreak in December (I was on vacation.) Entire store closed almost 2 weeks. Full HR/CDC investigation. HR is serious about it. They remote in &amp; check cameras. We must require masks of us &amp; customers. I get it &amp; have appreciated it for workers &amp; customers alike. 

But my state has been open season on shots 16yr+ for almost a month. Supply exceeds demand. As far as I know, only 3 of the 11 workers in my store have had a shot (although pretty much everyone else has natural immunity from December incident.) 

I'm relatively ok w no masks. I trust these vaccines. In fact, I'm looking forward to the opportunity in my personal life to move people's comfort level post-vaccine to ""normalcy."" But...It's my job to require it from customers. I'm NOT looking forward to what we are facing in the next few days/weeks. We have had to call cops many times since last summer. I know my community &amp; we workers are about to catch hell. We have already heard it from visitors from neighboring states ""my governor says we don't have to wear one"" 🙄

I say all this to implore you..once mandates are removed in your area, please be aware workers may be required to enforce masking rules. Be nice to us. We have been though a tough year (&amp; in a mask 40+hrs a week.) If a business requires it..comply &amp; don't complain to the worker. They have zero control over the policy.

There's nothing wrong with the emergency declarations per se, but the legislatures need to put on their big boy/girl pants and take action.  Or just delegate authority to the governor.  Either is fine.

What is not ok is governors passing 60-day after 60-day after 60-day emergency declaration.  That kind of interpretation is nonsensical.

Maybe it's because I'm from Europe, but over here, that's not really all that controversial. In my country, medical masks are already required in grocery stores, public transport, etc, and antigen testing is becoming a lot more common, so it's possible that they could pull this off if they wanted to open a mass event.

The applicable restrictions have not been changed in any way whatsoever. This has been the case in relation to basically every country in Europe, yet 6-10% of new cases in France are B1.351 infections. This is substantially more than the number of daily infections caused by B1.351 in South Africa. It is, in fact, entirely possible that France has more active cases caused by B1.351 than SA does at the moment. Europe as a whole certainly does, if approximately 3.7% of its active cases are driven by this particular variant.

South Africans are subject to travel bans by approximately 120 countries, so it is close to impossible for these infections to have been caused by them traipsing around Europe infecting people. Most common transit destinations are also inaccessible and airlines such as Emirates have yet to resume any flight services to and from the country.

Travel restrictions against South Africans have evidently been wildly unsuccessful in ridding Europe of the variant. However, whenever there is a surge in cases caused by B1.351, the travel restrictions are unnecessarily reemphasised and South Africans are unfairly scapegoated.

14 of 14 provided safety lab test were OK - no issues  
Statement that tested Sputnik V in Slovakia had different specifications and chracteristics than Sputnik V in trials and Lancet journal was exaggerated.

At the end there was difference in packaging only (2 doses vs 5 doses in trial). Nothing more.

Formally state regulator was right, that its different Sputnik V than in Lancet because ussually pharma regulator evaulate every packaging separately as new drug. But was wrong talking about specifications or even storage condition. Both -18 C.

Final statement was:  
*""We as national regulator are not prepared to complex evalution of new vaccines. This competance is on European medicine agency.*  
*As far as we try and knov and due to lack of documentation from Russian producer and lack of evidence of long term safety, we can not reccomend Sputnik V for general vaccination without proper registration in EMA.""*

There was no proof of insecurity or even hazardous elements in Sputnik V delivered to Slovakia.  
But true is, that Russian side did not disprove the opposite, or did not prooved safety of delireved product, but mostly safety of production.

Something like Brazilian ANVISA: We dont have proof of safety so its not safe. (this is correct).

The airline, one of Taiwan's largest, has reported several COVID-19 cases in the past week, though the source of these infections remains unclear.

On Tuesday, the CECC found that three CAL pilots tested positive for the coronavirus' antibodies but have no record of being infected with the disease, and began to test their close contacts.

Two family members of two of these pilots tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday.

One was a woman in her 40s, the other a teenage boy, the CECC said.

These new cases can be seen as family clusters and the CECC is conducting further tests to see if more people were infected.

The third domestic case reported Wednesday was a man in his 70s, who is the brother of a previously reported COVID-19 case.

After the man's brother tested positive for COVID-19 in early April, he helped deliver food for his sister-in-law, who was confirmed with the disease on Tuesday.

Besides the three domestic cases, Taiwan also recorded three new imported cases, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 1,116 since the outbreak began early in 2020.

The reality is, the side effects are either non-existent, or extremely mild, and extremely temporary, as this article shows. 

Even if you didn't read the article, most of us at this point know people in our lives, including perhaps ourselves, who have had the vaccine. Some felt no side effects. Some felt a sore arm. Some felt tired and achey. All of this lasted about a day or two. Just like OP's article says.

I'm a complete wuss, and I felt mild tiredness and acheyness, and if I wasn't asked about it by a dozen coworkers and friends and acquaintances, I never would've mentioned it. It wasn't nothing, but it was *almost* nothing. And that seems to be the experience of 90% of people.

Yet on social media, I see facebook and twitter posts of friends and randoms posting about their side effect worries, as if it's this terribly worrisome thing.

What reality are people living in?
 
My only explanation is that asking about vaccine side effects has become a new small talk version of ""How about this weather?"" People are lonely and bored and want to create conversation. And it's also a humble brag. ""Hey I got the vaccine early...but totes worried about these side effects!""

1) a big reason I go to NYCC (and similar cons) is cosplay. I just can't get excited to go as //insert character here// with a covid mask over top of it. Just not the same.  
2) there are lines everywhere, from some person at a booth in Aisle 1101 to photographs, autographs, Starbucks, not to mention the lines to get into panels, the main hall or even just to get inside. Multiply those lines by 6-10 to allow for social distancing and you have an absolute nightmare. The line to get something at Starbucks will begin at 34th st.  
3) a good chunk of being at a con like this you are practically pressed directly against other people, especially when just walking from here to there. Even with reduced ticket sales, I can't imagine how anyone could reasonably social distance unless tickets are like 20% of usual which means....  
4) ticket scalping will be 100X worse than usual for what will assuredly be a pared-down event.  


Remember that they have to project what the conditions (and state mandates) will be four months in advance (to sell tickets in June for October). I imagine they might sell half the tickets in June and the other half in August once they're sure they can actually be allowed to. It just sounds like a giant mess, hassle and for what? I can't see any con being worth it till December or 2022.

That initiative, called Covax, will deliver 145 million than 200 million doses have been administered in the U.S., Covax has supplied fewer than 41 million of the two billion doses planned by year-end. Slow uptake of Covid-19 vaccines in developing countries could create problems for the rest of the world. Epidemiologists believe that failure to vaccinate much of the developing world could leave a large reservoir of the coronavirus circulating, giving it the chance to mutate and possibly spill over to developed countries. Most of the Covax shots planned for the first half of the year were to be manufactured by the world’s biggest vaccine maker, the Serum Institute of India, which has partnered with AstraZeneca PLC to make the vaccine the company developed with the University of Oxford. **Output has also been constrained by limits imposed by the U.S.**

The CDC currently estimates that COVID has an R0 around 2.5, whereas the average for influenza strains is around 1.3.  However, there are years where influenza strains have an R0 that is approaching 2.  

Also, regardless, this article posted is about the age demographic below 18.  And it is a fact that there are more deaths, not just a higher IFR, for people in that age demographic for influenza than there is for COVID.

I looped in the under 40 demo, which does have a lower IFR for Covid than influenza, but I will leave it up to debate on whether the higher contagiousness of Covid factors into more deaths total in that demographic.  It's statistics after all, and the under 40 demo INCLUDES the under 18 demo.  Also, you should also probably factor in that we've never reported or put under a microscope any respiratory virus like we have with COVID.  Reporting a death as COVID-related only requires a positive PCR test within 30 days of death, and a PCR test that doesn't have any strict criteria on cycle threshhold(those above 30 in the past have usually not been considered a positive unless clinical symptoms are also present).

This is just factually incorrect. There is variance in all the vaccines' effectiveness and variance versus different variants, to say nothing of the likelihood of a need for future boosters as Covid changes. Moderna and Pfizer have great success right now for the variants they were tested with. And even though they currently appear strong against existing variants, [they are slightly less potent against variants in absolute terms.](https://www.biospace.com/article/pfizer-biontech-and-moderna-vaccines-effective-against-variants-and-more-covid-19-news/)

One way to estimate the upper bound of false positives would be to use test results from a country or region with extremely low prevalence and assume that all positive results are false positives.

For example, New Zealand posts their testing results on [this page](https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-data-and-statistics/testing-covid-19).

In the past 4 weeks (Mar 29-April 25), they conducted 115379 tests and got 171 positive.  If you assume all are false positives, that's a false positive rate of 0.15%. (A further 0.09% of tests were inconclusive.)

If you restrict it to community testing (and exclude those related to quarantines), and not those related to quarantine, 94170 tests were performed with 28 positive results, a positivity rate of 0.03%. (0.11% were inconclusive.)",,,1619638930,{},gw7kpbl,False,t3_n0cxzm,False,False,t1_gw78ke3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n0cxzm/new_us_covid19_cases_drop_sharply_with_deaths/gw7kpbl/,1619660050,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There are a few important caveats here. Number one, the false positive rate of a test depends on the test. Site of collection, method of collection, type of test, etc. There's no way to arrive at one true false positive rate overall, but 1% is a pretty reasonable estimate considering what we know about PCR testing in general. Covid is not the only disease with a PCR test.

Second, the likelihood of a false positive is directly related to disease prevalence. If there's a lot of disease, it's less likely that the positive result is a false positive. If there's not a lot of disease, it's more likely that your result is a false positive.

Prevalence of disease is best estimated by the positivity rate of the test as well as the total number of tests being performed. 

A high number of tests with a low positivity rate is generally predictive of low prevalence. A positive test should be evaluated with clinical signs and symptoms to rule out the possibility of a false positive. You can also repeat the test. The chances of two false positives from the same patient is quite low, especially if you use two different tests.  

A low number of tests with a high positivity rate doesn't indicate whether prevalence is high or low. More testing is needed. If you only test 5 out of 100,000 people, and all 5 of them are positive, you don't know with any certainty how many of the remaining 99,995 people may be positive.

If you test a high number of people and there's a high positivity rate, then the prevalence of the disease is high, and a positive test would be a more reliable predictor of infection.

Put another way: if you tested all 40M people in California for ebola using a PCR test, a small number of those tests would come back positive. Because there is no ebola in California (the disease prevalence is low), you can be reasonably sure that the people who tested positive don't have ebola, even though the test says they do.",,,1619638924,{},gw7kosw,False,t3_n0cxzm,False,True,t1_gw6xwc1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n0cxzm/new_us_covid19_cases_drop_sharply_with_deaths/gw7kosw/,1619660043,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

If you have airbags, but you add a seatbelt, you will significantly increase your likelihood of survival and decrease your likelihood and severity of injuries.

Or in other words, the airbag confers additional benefits.  If you are already outdoors and social distancing then masks confer no additional benefits.

I say this as someone who is double vaccinated and pro-mask while indoors and still happy to wear one indoors.

I don't think saying obviously wrong and dumb things is helping anything here.  It's not going to convince anti-maskers, it's just going to make them double down.

It's a huge issue at any concert that gets amplified in a music festival setting.   I used to work at a venue, if we saw what we thought was predatory behavior, we would go up to the person and ask the person being creeped on, ""do you know this person, is this behavior okay?"" Depending on the answer, tell the creeper ""the way you're acting towards this person is making me uncomfortable, so I can barely imagine how they feel.  For the rest of the night security will have eyes on you, if this behavior persists, you're out of here.""  

In a music festival where everyone is a participant, everyone needs to be expected to have these conversations.  At any music festival, if you dont feel empowered to call the guy out to his face, have a friend keep an eye on them while you go get security.  Security WILL take this very seriously, their only higher priority should be an active shooter.  If theres a huge brawl one way, and a possible sexual assault taking place the other way, my training told me to first go to the sexual assault. 

Next up is sobriety and consent.  If you see someone in a sex camp, who's too intoxicated to be having sex, that's another huuuge conversation to be having, especially with the prevalence of ketamine and other dissociative drugs.  There will 100% be guys who say ""it's fine, this is my incoherent girlfriend, we have sex all the time.""  When that takes place, the move is to explain to the guy that doesnt matter, she cant consent right now, call EMTs to see why the girl is incoherent, and get her the hell away from the predatory guy.  

I'm always brought back to what happened at the Korn set at MTVs Woodstock.  Theres a massive trigger warning for sexual assault.  In this instance, nobody said anything to two men who brutally assaulted a very small woman, and when they were done with her, sent her crowdsurfing to the front, crying her eyes out.  The crowd was so packed, security couldnt get to her, and the men never got caught.

&gt;You’re fully vaccinated, but as the virus bounces around unvaccinated folks, it will continue to mutate. Whether or not vaccinated folks will be safe from future strains is impossible to say.

This is fearmongering in response to someone saying they are fully vaccinated and safe.  Saying that as people spread a virus it has more chances to mutate is as much science as saying that the more often you eat hot dogs the higher chance you have from choking on one.  It's more of a duh statement that one leads to the other.  But do we really worry about choking from hot dogs and not eat them because of that risk?  No, because the risk is incredibly small even if it's one of the more common foods for adults to choke on.

People are maybe mad because thats not how herd immunity works. At least thats why it annoys me.

Herd immunity varies from virus to virus as its based on what percentage of the population needs to be immune. So if a lot of people refuse the vaccine, you're impeding our countries ability to reach a good level of herd immunity. I'm mainly annoyed about it because I for one would like to reach some form of normalcy soon, and a lot of people just don't give a shit. People complain about masks and whatever other pandemic related issues, yet they don't want to do whats needed to get there. I dont hate these people whatsoever, I just feel, based on the studies I've read, that there's no justification to wait on the vaccine.

&gt;If you believe the vaccine is effective...

It is effective so I'm unsure of why you would say ""if you believe"". Unless you are referring to specifically HOW effective.

Moderna: 91.4% effective after both doses
Pfizer: 95% effective after both doses
J&amp;J: 66% effective (i would not reccomend taking this one as more is being learned about it causing some issues with patients in rare cases)

These are the 3 authorized and reccomended vaccines within the United states. 

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines.html

My point however, is that every vaccine ever made is not going to be 100% effective, but some level of protection is better than no protection. On top of this there are cases called ""breakthrough cases"" where you can still be infected even with the vaccine, this happens with all vaccines and is again rare. On top of that, if you are in a room with 20 people who are all very sick, even with a vaccine, the viral load your exposed to could be much to great and your immune system wouldn't be able to fight it as effectively resulting in you getting sick.

&gt;They won't be able to spread it to you or your loved ones who are at risk and have the vaccine, so who cares if they get sick because they don't want to get the shot?

Like I said in my last answer, they could still get it. Its rare, but it can happen. That doesn't mean the vaccine isn't effective, it just means in rare cases it can still occur. Which is why herd immunity is needed.

Which they have started messaging. One of the main changes that this infographic did not include was this:

&gt; Visit with other fully vaccinated people indoors without wearing masks or physical distancing

The problem is, when you are in crowds or large groups, you don't know who is vaccinated or not. Some unvaccinated people would pretend they are vaccinated if the CDC guidelines changed to be ""Vaccinated people can throw away their masks and don't need them"". Plus, the US has only 29.1% of the population fully vaccinated. I wouldn't expect the CDC to say that masks aren't needed for vaccinated people until we reach at least 50% fully vaccinated.

And that's not even counting the fact that religion is completely entrenched in American politics. Out of the entire 232 year history of the United States Congress, there have been three atheist representatives, and one atheist senator. And all three of them were hesitant to use that label, and leaned more toward agnostic than anything else. The senator didn't even admit it at all in his own life; his grandson actually claimed he was an atheist years after he died.

No doubt that it is harder to get vaccinated in a town without a pharmacy, but at this point there is a surplus of vaccines. If you want a vaccine you can pretty much get one at this point.

""We do still recommend the vaccines, any benefit they can borrow from it, but still follow other precautions very closely.""

&gt;Although clinical trials found vaccines were highly effective in preventing symptomatic or severe COVID-19 infections, these trials largely excluded people who were immunocompromised.

&gt;That means these estimates may not apply to people with weakened immune systems, such as people with cancer or HIV.

&gt;It can also include people who are taking medications that weaken the immune system to manage medical conditions, like those with autoimmune conditions or who have had transplants. Approximately 3% of the U.S. population is immunocompromised, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Health Interview Survey.

snip

&gt;Normally a fully vaccinated person will produce COVID-19 antibodies, and those antibodies should show up on an antibody test. But some fully vaccinated people who are immunocompromised have been surprised to learn they're not producing enough antibodies to test positive on an antibody test.

&gt;In one study, just over half of patients with blood, bone marrow, and lymph node cancer had antibodies; in another, less than 40% of patients with the blood cancer CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) had an antibody response.

snip

&gt;""It's definitely possible that there was still immunity built up even if the test didn't acknowledge the presence of antibodies,"" said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor.

&gt;""We need to develop protocols for those who are antibody negative [after vaccination],"" said Dr. Mounzer Agha, a hematologist at UPMC Hillman Cancer Center and the lead author of the first study mentioned above. ""The reason for testing right now would be to tell patients that they may still be vulnerable and should continue to exercise caution.""

snip

&gt;  
&gt;Accounts of how the deals came about,  related by Ms. von der Leyen, Mr. Bourla, Mr. Marett and another nine  officials and experts involved, reveal a striking alignment of political  survival and corporate hustle.  
&gt;  
&gt;In her interview, Ms. von der  Leyen played down the political pressures she had faced, and said she  had been confident things would improve.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I knew that  the upscaling of the deliveries would have a slow start by nature in the  beginning, and therefore, I also knew the first quarter was going be  tough,” she said. But, she added, “I did not expect it to be as tough,  because we did not include the possibility that AstraZeneca would reduce  deliveries by 75 percent. That was a heavy setback.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Bourla said he built a bond with Ms. von der Leyen.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Multiple  leaders of the world, they would reach out to me, from presidents or  prime ministers and kings, and general secretaries of organizations,”  Mr. Bourla said.   
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Bourla said he and Ms. von der Leyen had  “developed a deep trust, because we got into deep discussions.” He said:  “She knew details about the variants, she knew details about  everything. So that made the discussion, way more engaged.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Despite  the deals with Pfizer and BioNTech, Europe is still playing catch-up  when it comes to vaccinating its citizens. As of this week, 22 percent  of European Union nationals have received at least one dose of a  Covid-19 vaccine, in contrast to half of Britons, 42 percent of  Americans and more than 62 percent of Israelis, according to [Our World in Data.](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)  
&gt;  
&gt;But the European Union has now made up for the vaccine it did not get from AstraZeneca — the bloc is [suing over the missed doses](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/26/world/europe/eu-astrazeneca-vaccine-lawsuit.html?searchResultPosition=5)  — and has moved forward its target date for getting 70 percent of its  adults fully immunized. It is now July, instead of September.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  bloc is already one of the world’s biggest producers and exporters of  Covid-19 vaccines, with just over 159 million doses shipped to 87  countries since December. That is almost exactly as many as it has kept  at home to immunize its own people.  
&gt;  
&gt;The agreement with  Pfizer and BioNTech will stipulate that the shots be produced in Europe,  bringing home not just the finished product, but also most of the 280  components that go into making it, Ms. von der Leyen and Mr. Bourla of  Pfizer said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The contract will also allow for a range of different vaccine products.  
&gt;  
&gt;An  internal European Commission assessment of the bloc’s needs over the  next two years, which is still being reviewed and was seen by The Times,  lays out ballpark figures for how many doses might be necessary under  different scenarios, although not all these needs would necessarily be  covered by the Pfizer contract. According to the draft assessment, the  bloc might require up to 510 million booster doses in 2022 and 2023.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr.  Bourla said he expected a booster would be needed six to twelve months  after people get their second shot, although some public health experts  note that it is not clear yet whether that will be necessary. And the  assessment includes a worst-case scenario for a new vaccine to target an  “escape mutant,” a variant of the coronavirus that is too resistant to  existing shots. The draft says the European Union would require 640  million doses of this type of vaccine for two doses per adult. And it  puts the number of pediatric vaccines at 130 million for 2022 and 65  million for 2023.  
&gt;  
&gt;The deal is not without risks, or critics. Countries and experts  worry that the European Union may be becoming too dependent on Pfizer,  and failing to hedge its bets in the event of problems with the vaccine  or its production.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I would caution against going for  Pfizer/BioNTech only,” said Prof. Peter Piot, a microbiologist who  advises Ms. von der Leyen. “That is too high risk for me,  scientifically,” he said, though he noted that mRNA technology vaccines  like Pfizer’s have so far been working well.  
&gt;  
&gt;Of the new E.U. deal with Pfizer, Professor Piot said, “My interpretation is, what works is who can deliver.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Ms. von der Leyen said the European Union could still procure doses from other companies.  
&gt;  
&gt;She  said the bloc was following the development of protein-based vaccines  made by Novavax and Sanofi, as well as mRNA vaccines from Moderna, which  are already being used in Europe, and CureVac, which is under review by  the E.U. regulator. The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, which was rolled  out in Europe this month, is also attractive because of its single-dose  regimen and easy storage, she said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Pfizer shot is also  expensive. While the financial details of the new agreement have not  been disclosed, the previous contract priced the shot at approximately  15.5 euros, or about 19 dollars, making it the second-most expensive  vaccine in the region after Moderna.  
&gt;  
&gt;European Union members will  each decide whether they want to use their full allocations of doses, or  leave some for others to absorb, or to be resold or donated. They will  also be free to make bilateral agreements with other pharmaceutical  companies for vaccines in the future.  
&gt;  
&gt;The new contract does little  to address mounting global calls for the release of patents or for  technology transfers to ensure that more of the world gets vaccinated  soon. With India in the throes of a catastrophic wave of the virus, and  the majority of the world’s population still far from getting access to a  first dose of any vaccine, Europe’s talk of doses for children and  boosters seems out of step with global needs, health experts say.  
&gt;  
&gt;And  while Ms. von der Leyen says the deal will enable the European Union to  help poorer regions, it reinforces the fact that the rich are still  coming first in the global scramble for vaccines.  
&gt;  
&gt;Siddartha Sankar Datta, a senior official with the World Health  Organization in Europe, said he worried about how the deal would affect  global supply.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I think the bottom line should be that  the access to this vaccine should not be a prerogative of the purchasing  power of the country,” he said. He said, “As countries make the effort  to ensure their population base gets benefits, we have to still keep  pushing ourselves to ensure more equitable access.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Still, for Ms.  von der Leyen, and for the European Union, the deal with Pfizer and  BioNTech offers a chance to remedy past mistakes.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Europe has  decided to make sure that, under any circumstances, they will be  prepared if there’s more need, and as a consequence of that political  decision, they are now prepared to take much bigger risks,” said Moncef  Slaoui, who led the U.S. vaccine effort Operation Warp Speed, and is in  frequent contact with Ms. von der Leyen on E.U. strategy.  
&gt;

[],,americainperdu,,,[],,,,text,t2_xt99s,False,True,[],"&gt;BRUSSELS — It was February and things were going from bad to  worse for the European Union’s vaccination campaign, and for its top  executive, Ursula von der Leyen.  
&gt;  
&gt;Much of Europe was in lockdown,  people were dying and the bloc was running low on doses of vaccines  after its biggest supplier, AstraZeneca, announced production problems.  Critics inside and outside the European Union questioned Ms. von der  Leyen’s leadership and [accused her of mishandling the crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/01/world/europe/eu-vaccine-von-der-leyen.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article).  
&gt;  
&gt;It was at that low point that she caught a break.  
&gt;  
&gt;For a month, Ms. von der Leyen had been exchanging texts and calls with Albert Bourla, the chief executive of [Pfizer](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/world/europe/european-union-pfizer-von-der-leyen-coronavirus-vaccine.html),  another vaccine supplier to the bloc. And as they spoke, two things  became clear: Pfizer might have more doses it could offer the bloc —  many more. And the European Union would be thrilled to have them.  
&gt;  
&gt;That personal diplomacy played a big role in [a deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/world/europe/EU-Pfizer-AstraZeneca-Covid.html),  to be finalized this week, in which the European Union will lock in 1.8  billion doses from Pfizer, which, with its smaller German partner,  BioNTech, made the first Covid-19 vaccine to get regulatory approval in  the European Union.  
&gt;  
&gt;The new contract will include a  900-million-dose order through 2023, with an option for another 900  million, Ms. von der Leyen said in an interview.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I am convinced that we are in this for the long haul,” she said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  deal will establish the European Union as Pfizer’s biggest single  client by far; the company has so far sold 300 million doses to the  United States. The contract will permit the European Union to resell or  donate the vaccines to partners, empowering it to conduct vaccine  diplomacy and support struggling efforts to immunize people in poorer  countries.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ms. von der Leyen and Mr. Bourla first connected in January,  when the pharmaceutical boss had to explain why his company had to cut  vaccine supplies temporarily while it upgraded manufacturing facilities  in Belgium. In November, the European Union signed an initial deal with  the company for 200 million doses, with the option to add 100 million.  
&gt;  
&gt;As  the improvements at the Belgium plant moved along with relative ease,  the discussions between the E.U. leader and the pharmaceutical chief  continued, both recounted in interviews with The New York Times.  
&gt;  
&gt;As  they talked, the pandemic was raging across Europe, and Pfizer and  BioNTech were hard at work trying to step up production. To increase the  companies’ production capacity even further, the chief commercial  officer at BioNTech, Sean Marett, was lining up regulatory approval for a  newly acquired plant in Germany, which was already producing vaccines  and stockpiling them in anticipation of getting a green light.  
&gt;  
&gt;By  the end of March, when the plant got its authorization, it had already  produced 11 million doses, which were soon directed to the European  Union.  
&gt;  
&gt;The calls resulted in a string of deals between the European  Union and the companies. On Feb. 17, the bloc announced an order for  another 200 million shots. On April 19, it activated an option to get  yet another 100 million.

Basically, we’re trying to prove a negative: that someone who is fully vaccinated and has an active COVID infection can’t spread the virus. You can’t – you can only infer it from the absence of the opposite: a vaccinated person *can* spread the virus.

Then there’s the question of how many of those 6000 breakthrough cases had an immune response, or does “fully vaccinated” mean “got both shots”. It’s not common, but my doctor has been having patients get antibody tests 2-3 weeks after their second dose, as several of her patients (all being treated for cancer or have detectable HIV/AIDS) had no immune reaction.

Because depending how the data is analyzed, people with no immune response may be lumped in with those who did, thus producing cases of “someone who received both doses of the vaccine contracting and spreading COVID”, which would boil down to, “Aha, the vaccine will only stop spread in 96.3% of the population!”, and that’s true (in the hypothetical situation where that number is correct), but it leaves out that the 3.7% that still spread it so so because of a lack of an immune response.

Anyways, my point is that **we don’t know**, and the safest (and best) assumption is that **if the virus is reproducing in your system, you can spread it**.

And so people should stop fucking saying “And we don’t even know if you can spread it with an active infection if you have the vaccine!”, as though it’s some magical remedy that, oops, still lets the virus reproduce in your system but *won’t* let you cough, spit, sneeze, etc. it out to infect other people.

Also, just shouting ""false equivalency"" is meaningless, you might as well ""caveat emptor"" or any other phrase.

I compared seatbelts to safety measures such as wearing a mask, in that both are part of an overall strategy for safety involving multiple elements.

But, this is a waste of time. You only care about yourself and your own risk, not those around you.

I might not end up dead or in a hospital, but I could potentially spread to those who could. Until a large majority of people are vaccinated, precautions are still necessary.

The thing is, plenty of experts have already said that the vaccines likely reduce transmission. And there's data to back it up. They just need more data before they can tell people with certainty. So yeah, it's safer to assume that vaccinated people can transmit the virus. That doesn't mean they transmit it to a degree that warrants any significant concern. 

From [The Atlantic:](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/02/how-public-health-messaging-backfired/618147/)

&gt;Take the messaging and public conversation around transmission risks from vaccinated people. It is, of course, important to be alert to such considerations: Many vaccines are “leaky” in that they prevent disease or severe disease, but not infection and transmission. In fact, completely blocking all infection—what’s often called “sterilizing immunity”—is a difficult goal, and something even many highly effective vaccines don’t attain, but that doesn’t stop them from being extremely useful.

&gt;As Paul Sax, an infectious-disease doctor at Boston’s Brigham &amp; Women’s Hospital, put it in early December, it would be enormously surprising “if these highly effective vaccines didn’t also make people less likely to transmit.” From multiple studies, we already knew that asymptomatic individuals—those who never developed COVID-19 despite being infected—were much less likely to transmit the virus. The vaccine trials were reporting 95 percent reductions in any form of symptomatic disease. In December, we learned that Moderna had swabbed some portion of trial participants to detect asymptomatic, silent infections, and found an almost two-thirds reduction even in such cases. The good news kept pouring in. Multiple studies found that, even in those few cases where breakthrough disease occurred in vaccinated people, their viral loads were lower—which correlates with lower rates of transmission. Data from vaccinated populations further confirmed what many experts expected all along: Of course these vaccines reduce transmission.

&gt;And yet, from the beginning, a good chunk of the public-facing messaging and news articles implied or claimed that vaccines won’t protect you against infecting other people or that we didn’t know if they would, when both were false. I found myself trying to convince people in my own social network that vaccines weren’t useless against transmission, and being bombarded on social media with claims that they were.

[From Esquire:](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a35614976/covid-19-vaccines-good-news-variants/)

&gt;All this positivity is not actually out of step with other recent news. The research on the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines also indicates they retain strong effectiveness against variants like the London strain. And while folks in the scientific community have been reluctant to say so until the data comes in, there's long been reason to believe that the vaccines will make a significant dent in transmission of the virus. The implications of that are huge: if getting vaccinated does not just stop you getting severe COVID, but limits how much it spreads, widespread vaccination should truly allow us to get back to something approaching our normal lives. The early data out of Israel, which has led the way on getting shots in arms, is extremely promising: the Pfizer shot is 98.8 percent effective at preventing deaths and hospitalizations, and has stopped 89.4 percent of transmission. If this pans out in larger data samples, and with respect to the two other formulas, these vaccines are nothing less than a miracle. It would mean we are likely nearing the end.

I have a New York Times link saying similar things I can share as well. You mentioned the factors that researchers have to consider, but it's not really relevant.

Unless you’re suggesting that no one except for experts are ever allowed to discuss a complex topic publicly, would eliminate 99.9% of posts and comments in this subreddit, then it is up to individuals to decide where they get their information from and how to value their opinions.

I am by no means an expert on vaccines, but I also don’t believe Rogan is, neither has he ever stated to be. I trust people like Fauci much more in this topic, which is why I’ve barely listened to Rogan talk about this subject. I would trust his opinion on Comedy and MMA as he is/was a professional in both, otherwise I would trust the expert opinions of his guests as it relates to topics they have expertise in.

In future, if developing countries are your bread and butter, they might well have to innovate or collaborate in order to maintain a competitive edge - grant licences and share your know-how with them (don't assume they won't pay for it) and you may well find yourself ahead of the game. 

The only fundamental mistake Moderna made early on was an outright refusal to even apply for approval in SA because it had earmarked its supply for the EU, the US, Canada and the UK. It suddenly found 20m doses one month later, but an alternative plan had already been made. These dismissive approaches are pretty much the norm when it comes to being part of the developing world, but it's still unacceptable, particularly as a month later it was made clear that there was sufficient capacity to offer us doses we had desperately needed when we first asked for a registration process to be initiated to that we could purchase the vaccines. 

OTOH, I'm sure middle-income countries don't particularly enjoy negotiating with Pfizer. You'll be on the cusp of putting pen to paper and finalising a contract before they come up with something they'd never insist upon from a developing country. Asking middle-income countries who have no issue establishing and running no-fault compensation schemes, providing indemnity and paying for the vaccines they've ordered should not be treated differently to wealthier nations. Requesting collateral in the form of sovereign assets and, in two out of three cases not backing down, is absurd.

We're talking about someone using their platform to spread lies, and misinformation about a vaccine. That vaccine is keeping people from getting sick, and a functional economy. That's not just a ""viewpoint."" It's harmful misinformation based on nonsense. It's going to cost lives, and money. People don't have the media literacy to know the difference. We'll put a warning on a show/ movie you're going to see a nipple or an ass, but we let fools, and liars push public opinion into nonsensical narratives.

There comes a point when platforms become complicit in enabling misinformation that harms society. Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh, Tucker Carlson, and Joe Rogan. You have the freedom to say what you want, but that doesn't mean a company is obligated to spread your nonsense. 

I would issue a caveat on your logic regarding the matter. We live in an age where complete nonsense is being pushed, and it's costing lives. I will never feel bad when someone using hate, to spread lies loses their platform. People go to bat to defend morons like Rogan, but they're the ones that are preventing our society from functioning at a higher level. People aren't ""tuning out.""

I do feel the social aspect is just as important though. I know somebody who was antivax who was hospitalized from covid last week. Sure, we can say it's their fault and not my responsibility, but I've personally taken a lead by example approach through this whole thing. Even as someone in a country with a relatively high percentage vaccinated, we're nowhere near that ""herd immunity"" threshold. Weighing risks vs reward, I believe it is fair to say we are still in a transitional phase, and that we should all be wearing masks, because even if you don't know if the individual person is vaccinated or not, we know that a strong majority aren't vaccinated and this overly lax mindset is risking setting us up for more unnecessary harm.

And just as a purely personal thing, I don't understand people who are pressed about me wearing a mask outside. It's a lot easier than constantly putting it on and off and really just not a big deal at all. I'd rather not have to wear it but it's whatever.

\-For the majority of people that shouldn't be a concern.

The EU did allocate €336m to go to AZ before delivery to purchase raw materials, sign contracts with manufacturing plants, etc, so there is an argument that some of that money could have gone to the UK, but no solid evidence that it actually did. 

From the [leaked contract](https://www.politico.eu/article/italian-broadcaster-publishes-full-commission-vaccine-contract-with-astrazeneca/) (in Schedule A), we know that only about €205m is actually for ""Drug Substance CMO capacity reservation fee, raw materials, and resins"".  We're only talking about the capacity reservation fee here, and only two of the four factories, so only a portion of that could possibly have gone into the UK.

It's worth pointing out as well that several weeks after the article you linked was published, the [EU hadn't given all that money to AstraZeneca](https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-vaccine-europe-commission-contract-astrazeneca-ties-hands-lawsuits/):

&gt;The Commission said it would pay the initial €336 million to ramp up the manufacturing of the drug substance, to be paid in three installments. The Commission has paid two-thirds of that so far.

It's hard to find exactly how much the UK spent to set up manufacturing of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, but there's at least [£65.5m that went to the University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-05-18-funding-and-manufacturing-boost-uk-vaccine-programme) in May for ""the commercialisation and manufacturing of their potential vaccine"", long before the EU were offering any funding. By the end of 2020 [""the \[UK\] government has invested over £230 million into manufacturing a successful vaccine""](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/second-covid-19-vaccine-authorised-by-medicines-regulator) (although that does include funding to other manufacturers too).

We're already at the stage where people think it's weird to wear a mask. People still have them on going into an indoor business (even then not always) but even in the weeks leading up to the mask mandate lifted, outdoors it was like 1 in 20 wearing a mask including in a crowded park. Uber drivers seem upset when I don't take my mask off when entering their vehicle. ""I know it's the rules but I think it's dumb so just take it off"" is the general attitude.

It's really just better to wear it even outdoors if you ask me. I know everyone is like ""but I don't have to and the science says it doesn't spread outdoors"" and uh no, being outdoors does mitigate spread (especially in a non crowded environment) but does not prevent it. Much more importantly though, is even if you have the vaccine, even if we are protected, we're creating an environment where over 80% is not fully vaccinated and close to 70% is not vaccinated at all (in my area), and those people will just lie about having the vaccine.

Vaccination rate already seems to be slowing down here, and a big problem with people not getting their second dose. I get it, the science says you are already protected at a fairly high rate with just one but I'm really astounded at the complete lack of discipline throughout this whole pandemic, and moreso that people are bothered if you are doing the right thing, and I'm not just talking about covidiots. I get the CDC has to water things down to get people to comply at all but can we please not mess this up at the end and just mask up a little while longer.

By not wearing masks now, we are creating an environment that encourages widespread maskless interactions when 75% haven't been vaccinated and so many will lie, and case numbers, while relatively low compared the winter explosion are still comparable to last summer when we needed to take it seriously.

And yeah sure, that's ""their problem"", but not only theirs when the risk of a vaccine resistant variant spreading, is a possibility. At this stage we only have a partial victory.

[],,anachronicnomad,,,[],,,,text,t2_wj8ln,False,False,[],"Hi there!  I saw an ad on the front page for this, and thought it was cool, but the ad didn't link directly to the question/answer form.

**Background:**

I'm a Math/CompSci/DataSci undergraduate student at a local university.  In one of my final projects using CDPHE data from 3/20/2021 to 3/21/2021 (cumulative!), we noted a significant negative association between not only how urbanized a county is, but also the proportion of the counties' population which was Non-White, compared to the Vaccine Administration rates per capita (per 100k).

However, these trends were dismissed by linear modeling approaches done by a Public Health student, largely due to structural and clustering effects among majority-White Conservative-leaning counties (which also had low vaccination uptake rates) and a pattern-break with 100% rural counties following a different distribution entirely.

[Vaccine Admin. vs Pct. NHW -- Note the clustering of Conservative-leaning counties in the bottom-right, which would throw off a linear model.](https://i.imgur.com/nVr5Uow.png)

[Vaccine Admin. vs Pct. Rural -- Clear trends in urbanized counties, but a whole different spread for 100% rural, probably determined by an unknown factor](https://i.imgur.com/HvHeX5g.png)

You can imagine my disappointment when the Public Health student decided to ignore the empirical evidence of these underlying trends in favor of examining political sentiment and age, just because the linear model and statistical power tests said so (while mostly ignoring the mathematical effect of the structures present in the underlying data and the priority-group designation of seniors by public policy earlier in the pandemic).  I became even more disheartened when I realized that general Public Policy and Health experts were probably taking the same exact same tack.

As a perpetually low-income POC who has largely observed my hourly laborer and Black &amp; Latin friends get infected over the course of the pandemic (even as recently as last week), while my white yuppy ""well off"" friends and boomers have the ability to drive &amp; wait 5 hours somewhere or straight up fly to anywhere else, I'm deeply frustrated by the whole situation.  I personally was only able to schedule my first shot three weeks ago by writing a bot which hit the campus' vaccine website as soon as it read an Outlook email alert.  By vast majority, I'm actually observing people procrastinate on getting the vaccine because they are otherwise occupied, were recently infected through their workplace, or are simply burned out on the entire hype machine surrounding it and have buried their heads in the sand -- not distrust of the vaccine proper or political leaning, necessarily.

**Direct Questions:**

* With the Ball Arena mass-vaccination site going online, do we expect to see this situation actually improve, given that whole block and intersection is somewhere most people try to avoid driving to?
* What additional policy decisions could include guard-rails to ensure that vaccination access becomes possible for those of us most impacted and have loudly wanted the vaccine since the trials were announced as complete, but have been unable to acquire it?
* Are there adaptive supply-chain logistics in place for Colorado which can shift doses to areas where demand is highest, and what is the observable metric which accounts for real demand for vaccinations (if either of these even exist)?
* Given the limitations of the time-frame of our dataset, is there new evidence to suggest that the trends I've noted previously have actually reversed in recent weeks?
* What stands out to you as the leading factor among the general public in why public policy has been less-effective-than-desired at keeping our Replication Rate lower?  Are there any structural issues within the public discourse which can be attributed to something other than federal mismanagement in 2019/2020?  What changes are planned for approaching a crisis such as this in the future (given the possibility this will not be a one-off over the next 50 years, conjecture based on the presentations by John Oliver and interviews with microbio people on YouTube)?
* Now that there is larger awareness of how viral diseases spread, will we continue to see a drop-off in pneumonia, influenza, and the common cold?
* What limitations exist in mRNA vaccination or treatment developments?  Now that we've begun to crack the code and use the associated techniques en masse, what possibilities exist in the future for mRNA treatments?
* Finally, now that I'm burdened with all this knowledge, what strategies do you use for ignoring it all and de-stressing that isn't personally harmful in some way?  Between focusing on carbon emissions and drought data for another project, in addition to the ""human factors"" in research, policy, higher education, and everything else going on; I'm split between graduating this semester and becoming a ski- or beach- bum, apprenticing a trade, or becoming a goat herder on another continent.  I'm tired of feeling like a Cassandra jacked up on an internet connection, strapped to train tracks with zero realistic way of escaping, while I'm watching the train barrel down on us all.

The first few months of the pandemic we didn't know enough about how to care for patients *and* hospitals were unprepared for the volume of patients, so a higher percentage of severe cases ended in death. Look up growth of cases in places where ""hard"" lockdowns were actually enforced (not just islands; look at India for April &amp; May 2020 when 1.3 billion people together had almost 10x fewer cases than the US) and see that, at the very least ""if adherence to recommendations had been significantly higher, the worst parts of the pandemic..."" would at least have been significantly reduced.

Separately from lockdowns, multiple researchers (some doing simulations, but now also some looking at places where compliance has actually been high) have shown that if 80% or more of a population consistently wears masks properly and practices reasonable social distancing (literally just the left column of the new chart; don't do the stuff in red, try to avoid stuff in yellow, always wear a mask when in contact with people outside your household) the R0 drops well below 1 and cases don't grow geometrically like they did most of last year—they drop off sharply.

Furthermore, adding effective contact tracing (and associated quarantining &amp; testing) can make an even bigger difference and is the *real* appropriate response to ""a few cases popping up"". Some asian countries have managed to keep cases extremely low even without lockdowns or ""harsh"" restrictions like shutting down indoor dining by having ubiquitous and thorough contact tracing. If a person tests positive, everyone they've come in contact with (even in public settings like restaurants) gets quarantined &amp; tested, along with the subsequent contact networks of those exposed people, and outbreaks are stopped in their tracks.
