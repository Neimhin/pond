The reason we have a difference is the level of education in the community that drove higher vaccination rates, nothing else really made a difference between us or Flordia, Texas or any other place.

Are you observing that majority of the patients who develop severe covid and have to get hospitalized or even vented are unvaccinated people or are the new variants causing the severe complications in Vaccinated folks as well (compared to the numbers before the vaccines)

This by no means is supposed to be taken as 'questioning the authenticity of the vaccine' I am a certified Medical Practitioner certainly not an anti-vax. It is about enquiring about the efficacy of the vaccine against new variants as my country is awaiting the almost inevitable next wave.

Where the treating physician is defined as

&gt; ""Treating physician"" means the physician primarily responsible for providing medical care and treating an eligible patient's terminal condition. ""Treating physician"" does not include the patient's primary care physician unless that physician is treating the patient's terminal condition and no other physician is primarily responsible for treating the terminal condition. The patient may have more than one treating physician

In short, a key part of the Ohio law is that both the patient **and their treating physician** have to agree to the treatment.  This second part, does not seem to be the case here.

It's important that not any physician can recommend the treatment, but instead the one currently responsible for the treating the patient has to recommend the treatment. This distinction is important, because it protect patients from snake oil salesmen. We know the the critically ill and their families are in a difficult spot, and they are often desperate. But we also know that throughout history, vultures have prayed on desperate families.

When a person is infected they can know where they were at certain times. It makes contact tracing easier. They contacted her business and from video surveillance they knew she was the cashier. She was advised to go get tested and they did a deep clean of the store. At the federal level the government is paying for the vaccines and that information is available at the Medicare website, which is federal When I was vaccinated the dr entered the vaccine info eg lot number date and my medicare details into the government website.  Most people have phones in Australia.  But I can access that information through the state website as well. We are of course under lockdown at the moment. I am sure there are protocols in place for when we open up. We have been advised already that anyone coming to Australia must have a double vaccine. When people come to Australia for longer times they have to have a health check. They go to their doctor and then somehow that doctor is able to send the relevant information to the Australian immigration department. The passenger is issued an electronic visa that is not stamped in the passport but is on the computer system at immigration control. I just cannot believe that the USA is behind Australia and Europe.

Not really. Like any piece of data, you can include a cryptographic signature with the contents of the QR code. Changing the contents of the data would make the signature invalid, so would be immediately apparent to someone scanning it. To generate a signature, you need a private key that will be held by the relevant health authority. To verify that a signature is valid, you need a public key that is derived from the private key, but which can be freely shared with the public.

So when someone comes up with a QR code, the scanner will read the data, read the signature and then use the public key of the health authority to verify that the signature is authentic and matches the data. As long as the private key is securely stored and there are no glaring bugs in the implementation, such QR codes can't be altered or forged without the cooperation of the agency holding the private key. The public key can be stored in the scanner app or it can simply be downloadable from a central server / website. In the first case, the entire process of validating the QR code can be done offline.

This method with cryptographic signatures is how the EU Digital Covid Certificate works.

As of September 2, over 5 million children have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic. About 252,000 cases were added the past week, the largest number of child cases in a week since the pandemic began. After declining in early summer, child cases have increased exponentially, with over 750,000 cases added between August 5 and September 2.  
  
The age distribution of reported COVID-19 cases was provided on the health department websites of 49 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam. Since the pandemic began, children represented 15.1% of total cumulated cases. For the week ending September 2, children were 26.8% of reported weekly COVID-19 cases.  
  
A smaller subset of states reported on hospitalizations and mortality by age; the available data indicate that COVID-19-associated hospitalization and death is uncommon in children.  
  
At this time, it appears that severe illness due to COVID-19 is uncommon among children. However, there is an urgent need to collect more data on longer-term impacts of the pandemic on children, including ways the virus may harm the long-term physical health of infected children, as well as its emotional and mental health effects.",,,,1631111129,{},hc28umo,True,t3_pkbjda,False,False,t3_pkbjda,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pkbjda/children_and_covid19_statelevel_data_report/hc28umo/,1631185103.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,Synonyms26,,,[],,,,text,t2_10wdsu,False,True,[],"H√Ä N·ªòI¬†‚Äî¬† Representatives from Vi·ªát Nam‚Äôs Health Ministry and France‚Äôs Xenothera, a medical laboratory in Nantes,¬†on Wednesday had an online meeting over their co-operation in phase-3 clinical trials and technological transfer to produce¬†XAV-19,¬†a drug used in COVID-19 treatment.

XAV-19 is a polyclonal antibody directed against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, attacking the virus in multiple ways.

The results of phase 1 and 2 clinical studies show that the drug is safe and effective in preventing the disease from getting worse, neutralising the virus and reducing inflammation in patients.

It is proved that the polyclonal property of XAV-19 makes the treatment effective against the SARS-CoV-2 strains that have been discovered to date.¬†

This polyclonal antibody also can create immediate immunity and prevent viruses from entering cells. This is an important difference from the monoclonal antibodies that are currently being used to treat patients in the early stages of infection.¬†

Phase 3 of clinical trials of the XAV-19 is carried out in France and other European countries like Greece, Bulgaria, Romania and Spain.

At the meeting, Odile Duvaux,¬†Xenothera's¬†Chief Executive Officer, said they were¬†willing to co-operate with Vi·ªát Nam in conducting phase-3 clinical trials in the country.

She also expressed the company's¬†goodwill for further co-operation, particularly¬†those relating to technological transfer so that Vi·ªát Nam could produce XAV-19 by itself in future.

In late May this year, the French Government signed a contract with the medical laboratory to reserve 30,000 doses of XAV-19, designed to stop patients from becoming seriously ill after the treatment was approved for use in an emergency.

Deputy Minister of Health Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Thu·∫•n said at the meeting that Vi·ªát Nam appreciated promising results of the first and the second phases of XAV-19 clinic trials.

Vi·ªát Nam was willing to co-operate with the laboratory in phase 3 of clinical trial and technological transfer so that the country could access additional COVID-19 treatments,¬†he said.

The meeting between Vi·ªát Nam‚Äôs health authority and the French medical laboratory took¬†place after a local group - the Advanced International JSC¬†of Vi·ªát Nam (AIC Group) ‚Äì contacted Xenothera and connected it with the ministry.

After the meeting, the two sides would continue discussions to prepare for a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) over their co-operation on XAV-19 clinic trials and technological transfer. ‚Äî¬†VNS",,,,1631110988,{},hc28isr,True,t3_pkbhs3,False,True,t3_pkbhs3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pkbhs3/vi·ªát_nam_and_france_cooperate_in_covid19_drug/hc28isr/,1631184936.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

HCM CITY¬†‚Äî¬†HCM City residents who were given the Moderna vaccine as their first injection will be inoculated with the¬†Pfizer vaccine as their second shot.

Speaking at a press meeting on Tuesday, Nguy·ªÖn Ho√†i Nam, deputy head of the city Department of Health, said the¬†city‚Äôs number of¬†vaccines,¬†including Moderna,¬†is limited.
As many as 446,118 people in the city¬†were immunised with the¬†Moderna vaccine between¬†August 1 and¬†15.

The recommended interval between the first shot and the second for Moderna¬†is four¬†weeks.
According to the Ministry of Health, there are no more Moderna vaccines in storage. The country so far has depended¬†on¬†donations for Moderna.
According to the city's¬†Department of Health, the¬†Moderna and Pfizer vaccines use the same mRNA technology and have a similarly high efficacy at preventing symptomatic disease.
Previously, a number of¬†people in the city whose¬†first shot was AstraZeneca received Pfizer as their second shot after AstraZeneca supplies¬†ran out.¬†¬†

The city aims to have¬†all¬†people aged 18¬†and over receive¬†the first shot by September 15, and¬†the second shot by the end of the year.
The city currently has AstraZeneca, Pfizer¬†and Vero Cell vaccines.

As of September 7, more than 6.5 million doses have been administered in the city, including more than 6 million for the first shot. As many as¬†700,519 people aged¬†65 and over¬†and those with underlying medical conditions have been vaccinated.¬†‚Äî¬†VNS",,,,1631110832,{},hc285os,True,t3_pkbf69,False,True,t3_pkbf69,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pkbf69/vietnam_hcm_city_to_use_pfizer_vaccine_as_second/hc285os/,1631184749.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately Delta is so infectious that spread will continue despite this, but we're at the peak in terms of healthcare system impact (so long as there is not YANV - yet another new variant) simply because seropositivity - through vaccine or from infection - greatly reduces hospitalization rates. 

The fact that states that got hit by Delta hardest the earliest - e.g., Missouri and Florida - have clearly peaked is indicative of that. Hospitalizations are trailing down in those states.

Both suffered a cough and fatigue. When my grandfather started feeling better, he went to exercise on his stationary bike and couldn't get up, so he was sent to the hospital. At the hospital, the doctors said his issue wasn't directly COVID, but that he was way too dehydrated to be exercising. On top of that, he apparently was infected with a second cold at the same time as COVID.

Despite their age and underlying conditions, my grandfather only had a short hospital stay, and him and my grandmother only had minor symptoms lasting about a week. As soon as their quarantine lifted, they were eager to start going out again and had no lingering symptoms.

Oh that's right, it didn't work out like that. The response essentially let it spread, and the US and everyone else got lucky that it wasn't worse, as covid was, although the CDC does say it killed between 150,000 and half a million people.  People forget, and now want China to have acted on what they didn't know back in December of 2019, but did know later in February 2020.

Compare that timeline to the H1N1 response (Wikipedia's account of it):

In April 2009, an outbreak of influenza-like illness (ILI) occurred in Mexico and then in the United States;\[27\] the CDC reported seven cases of novel A/H1N1 influenza and promptly shared the genetic sequences on the GISAID database.\[28\]\[29\] With similar timely sharing of data for Mexican isolates,\[30\] by 24 April it became clear that the outbreak of ILI in Mexico and the confirmed cases of novel influenza A in the southwest US were related and WHO issued a health advisory on the outbreak of ""influenza-like illness in the United States and Mexico"".\[27\] The disease then spread very rapidly, with the number of confirmed cases rising to 2,099 by 7 May, despite aggressive measures taken by the Mexican government to curb the spread of the disease.\[31\] The outbreak had been predicted a year earlier by noticing the increasing number of replikins, a type of peptide, found in the virus.\[32\]  
  
On 11 June 2009, the WHO declared an H1N1 pandemic, moving the alert level to phase 6, marking the first global pandemic since the 1968 Hong Kong flu.\[33\] On 25 October 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama officially declared H1N1 a national emergency.\[34\] The President's declaration caused many U.S. employers to take actions to help stem the spread of the swine flu and to accommodate employees and / or workflow which may have been impacted by an outbreak.\[35\]",,,,1631073846,{},hc0qejl,False,t3_pjsm97,False,False,t1_hbzkicu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pjsm97/who_says_covid_will_mutate_like_the_flu_and_is/hc0qejl/,1631156513.0,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;‚ÄùMy fight is not done,‚Äù Ceballos, 52, wrote on Twitter. He shared a photo that showed an oxygen mask strapped to his head, and he said he was spending a 10th day in the ICU as covid was ‚Äúofficially kicking‚Äù his rear.

&gt;On Aug. 27, Ceballos announced via Instagram that a golf event benefiting his charity foundation would be postponed because he had contracted the coronavirus. ‚ÄúI am out of the hospital and currently resting [at] home,‚Äù he wrote at the time.

&gt;A 1995 NBA all-star, Ceballos spent most of his 11-year career with the Phoenix Suns, Los Angeles Lakers and Dallas Mavericks. The 6-foot-6 small forward averaged 14.3 points in the NBA, with a career high of 21.7 in that 1994-95 season with the Lakers that earned him his all-star nod. He led the NBA in field goal percentage during a 1992-93 campaign in which his Suns enjoyed their first 60-win season and got to the NBA Finals before losing to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls.

&gt;Ceballos, who won the NBA‚Äôs slam dunk contest in 1992 on the strength of a full-court sprint and jam while blindfolded, entered the league as a second-round draft pick by Phoenix out of Cal State Fullerton in 1990. He closed with stints in Detroit and Miami during his final season of 2000-01.

&gt;In 2011, while playing for the American Basketball Association‚Äôs Arizona Scorpions, a team he co-owned at the time, Ceballos reportedly suffered several small heart attacks. He underwent surgery to open a pair of blocked arteries and made a successful recovery, which he credited in part to having lost weight while preparing to play again.

From the very first weeks of the pandemic, I've been screaming at anyone who will listen that kids need to be protected *the most* out of anyone from a novel virus. They have the most life left to live and the greatest potential for longterm consequences.

As soon as people figured out kids weren't instantly dying as fast as adults, they declared that kids dont get COVID or that it doesn't matter if they do. It's insane. That's not how viruses work.

We know that childhood infections can cause all sorts of lifelong or recurrent issues, so there was no reason whatsoever to assume kids *won't* have longterm consequences from COVID. We just can't know what the consequences will be for decades.

Chicken pox doesn't seem all that bad - most kids just get a fever and an itchy rash. But the virus lives dormant in nerve cells for life and can reactivate in times of stress as debilitatingly painful shingles and severe chronic pain called postherpetic neuralgia.

Measles seems like another fairly straightforward fever-plus-rash virus in kids. About a decade later, some survivors develop subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which is a neurological disorder that disables and then kills them, and again in no way resembles the initial infection.

So here we are, with a brand new virus that we know kills and disables adults and children on an acute time scale, and people are pretending that there's no chance these kids develop major consequences over time?

Nobody would conceive of what shingles would be after observing the first child with chicken pox. Nobody would conceive of what SSPE would be after observing the first child with measles. And although it's bacterial and not viral, another example would be scarlet fever - nobody watching kids develop bad throat infections would say, ""Hey I bet there's gonna be a thing called rheumatic heart disease that's gonna fuck this kid up in 40 years.""

She can't point me to any proof or studies, nevermind what OTHER drugs these supposed cured people were taking at the same time. She's so entrenched in the anti-vax, right political mentality that I literally bring up medical articles on my phone that refute what she's saying and her first response is ""what website is that from?"" I tell her WebMD (lol) and I ask her if WebMD is now partisan. She had no answer for me.

I told her if she is hospitalized with Covid-19, I will do everything in my power to make sure she doesn't get Ivermectin and is given shit that actually works.

The COVID vaccines on the other hand produce much higher levels of antibodies but also strong B cell and T cell responses. B cell and T cell responses last much longer. Possibly decades. So even if the surface of the virus looks different due to antigenic drift, you are still protected from severe disease due to B and T cell protection.

As for pancovid vaccines, we already know that people previously infected that get the current mRNA vaccine shots produce antibody protection against not only all currently known variants of SARS-CoV-2 but also antibodies that bind to SARS-CoV-1 and also for instance the RaTG13 bat coronavirus and a Pangolin coronavirus (I can't remember the name).

If it would be less damaging it would also become less deadly. Why spread to 6 people and then kill the host, killing a perfectly good colony of viruses as well when you can just rough the host up slightly and get him to infect 6 more people?

If the version that kills infects 6 people and the one that doesn't gets 12 people then now suddenly those 6 people each get 6 and that makes 36 infections with the deadly strain, but the 12 people get 12 each making 144 infections with the less deadly strain. Suddenly the less deadly strain is much larger and much more present. This example is of course a bit simple and a bit limited, but it's a short explanation on evolution of the virus. And yes, if we kick out the virus and subsequently die when no longer contagious that's none of the virus' concern, but that's not the way people are dying anyway.

And as to why we still have fatal diseases, diseases are always most lethal when they first appear, and new diseases have been appearing. Usually they will originate in other species, and what the diseases do might just change completely whenever they swap.

We've got stuff like influenza, which originated from birds. Birds can get the disease but because it's pretty much inherent it doesn't affect them much. The strains that have adapted well to humans are not very damaging and spread really fast. There are also strains which do really poorly with humans, they kill over 50% of humans who get it but don't really spread.

There's Q-fever, which predominantly spreads from lambs butis really hard to transmit person to person.

There's MERS, Covid's older relative, MERS is just hopping around the middle east killing about 50% of the people who get it, not a lot of people get it though because people don't reall spread it, camels do.

There's aids, which is rumoured to have found its way to humans through sexual contact with primates.

And now, of course, covid, which is rumoured to originate from the pangolin but I'm not sure anything has been proven yet.

Most of those are very very deadly if they don't get the time to adapt to humans and fairly benign when they do get the time to adapt. In fact a fairly large part of our DNA exists out of inactive retroviruses.

I had never seen anything like that my life.   

It stands to reason that if you have an overall younger population and many people who are not making it to 60 or 70 you can hypothetically end up in a situation you are just limboing under the mass Covid fatality bar.

It reminds me what I read in a book called the Emperor of all maladies about the history cancer.  The author a world renowned oncologist reflects on the curious absence of cancer in historical literature. And while he does allow ignorance of diagnosis and the possibility of other factors and whatnot he says at the most logical explanation is more likely due to the fact that most cancers happen in a particular age range and that age range did not exist in as large of a population percentage worldwide as it does now in any time up until recent history.  It‚Äôs a numbers game.

A total of 12,663 were¬†locally acquired, with¬†7,851¬†found in the community.

The two southern hotspots of HCM City and B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng Province reported 7,308 and 3,172 new infections, respectively, accounting for the majority of the country's caseload.

The breakdown of new infections by localities are as follows:¬†ƒêoÃÇÃÄng Nai (814), Long An (372), TieÃÇÃÄn Giang (171), CaÃÇÃÄn ThoÃõ (83), ƒêoÃÇÃÄng ThaÃÅp (62), BiÃÄnh PhuÃõoÃõÃÅc (61), QuaÃâng BiÃÄnh (53), TaÃÇy Ninh (52), KhaÃÅnh HoÃÄa (48), An Giang (46), KieÃÇn Giang (43), NgheÃ£ÃÇ An (42), BaÃÄ RiÃ£a - VuÃÉng TaÃÄu (42), HaÃÄ NoÃ£ÃÇi (40), ƒêaÃÄ NaÃÜÃÉng (30), ƒêaÃÜÃÅk NoÃÇng (28), BiÃÄnh ƒêiÃ£nh (27), BiÃÄnh ThuaÃ£ÃÇn (26), ƒêaÃÜÃÅk LaÃÜÃÅk (24), PhuÃÅ YeÃÇn (19), QuaÃâng NgaÃÉi (19), BaÃ£c LieÃÇu (18), SoÃÅc TraÃÜng (13), TraÃÄ Vinh (11), ThuÃõÃÄa ThieÃÇn HueÃÇÃÅ (9), BeÃÇÃÅn Tre (6), BaÃÜÃÅc Ninh (5), CaÃÄ Mau (5), Gia Lai (3), QuaÃâng Nam (2), Ninh ThuaÃ£ÃÇn (2), SoÃõn La (2), ThaÃÅi BiÃÄnh (1), HuÃõng YeÃÇn (1), HaÃÄ TiÃÉnh (1), LaÃ£ng SoÃõn (1) and¬†HaÃ£ÃÇu Giang (1).

The seven-day moving average was reported as 12,862.

The new cases brought the national caseload to 563,676, making Vi·ªát Nam 50th out of¬†222 countries and regions in terms of total infections and 158th in terms of infections per one million people.

A total of 559,346 cases have been reported in the fourth wave of infections that began late April.

A further 13,937 COVID-19 patients have been released from hospital in the past 24 hours, bringing the total recoveries to 325,647.

6,479 patients are in serious condition, with 29 requiring life support (ECMO), according to the health ministry.

Vi·ªát Nam also reported¬†335 new COVID-19 deaths today, bringing the country's total to 14,135 (2.5 per cent of confirmed caseload, 0.4 per cent higher than the world's average rate of 2.1 per cent).

HCM City and B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng lead the national death count¬†with 268 and 34 fatalities each, and the rest mostly in southern localities.

771,937 doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered on Tuesday, bringing the country's total doses to nearly 23.6 million. Nearly 3.8 million people have been fully vaccinated.
More testing needed

Also today, health minister Nguy·ªÖn Thanh Long sent an urgent dispatch to COVID-19 hotspots in the country - H√† N·ªôi, Ph√∫ Y√™n Province in the south-central region, and 20 provinces and cities in the southern region, including HCM City - telling them to speed up COVID-19 testing, as a key measure during the time these localities stay under social distancing, to lift restrictions soon and avoid prolonged lockdowns.

By September 15, all households in¬†high-risk¬†and very high risk¬†areas should be tested at least three times (once every 2-3 days), using either individual rapid antigen tests or RT-PCR diagnostics with¬†pooled samples.

In other areas, households should be tested at least once, using RT-PCR diagnostics with pooled samples.

It's noted that the sample collection will be taking place at the homes or¬†residences of the tested people.

Medical personnel and other staff working at healthcare facilities and¬†essential businesses should be tested for COVID-19 once every three days.

Health authorities are also urged to consider providing training and demonstrations for residents to take samples themselves, under the guidance of health workers. ‚Äî VNS",,,,1631110622,{},hc27nqo,True,t3_pkbdbz,False,False,t3_pkbdbz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pkbdbz/vi·ªát_nam_logs_12680_new_covid19_infections_335/hc27nqo/,1631184497.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

My parents are boomers, lean right politically, but they think all these anti-vax weirdos are completely insane and selfish. My folks grew up with kids still getting polio and dying from completely preventable diseases by today's standards. The polio vaccine was considered a god damn miracle back then. The generational divide on Covid vaccination is pretty wild when you think about it with who is getting the shot and who isn't solely based on age demographics. It totally crosses the political spectrum and personal values. There's this subset of people in their middle years that have never experienced a pandemic/epidemic in their lives and are completely dumbfounded on how to approach it, eat misinformation, and don't trust anything except their own social media bubble. It's wild.

I was living/working in South Korea from 2008 to 20xx when Swine Flu (H1N1) was a huge deal there. It was more of an esoteric threat since it definitely was not as contagious as Covid, but Koreans still took precautions in the simplistic sense (wearing masks on public transport, in offices, etc.). I was a dumbass 20-something that didn't fully grasp it either, but decided to mask up on public transportation when there were flare ups of H1N1. Felt weird, but got over myself quickly when I realized that is the norm there. People in Asia generally wear a mask if they are feeling ill and have to take public transport. Parents send their kids to school with a mask on if their kids seems unwell. It's all about, ""Hey, I'm not feeling good. I'm wearing this for you and me."" Life continued on as normal in Korea with Swine Flu present and the government enacted few restrictions (mandatory quarantine for visa holders arriving, testing, etc.).

Anyway, I'm glad you got over the Swine Flu. That shit was no joke either! I couldn't comprehend when the lead singer of a band I love (Broadcast) died from it at the tail end of the pandemic.

If the person was joking then their argument is likely based how the CDC and FDA have been acting in the US rather than any actual science. The CDC and FDA have been a stickler for following the rules as much as possible, far more than other countries, and have been fighting anything that deviates from those rules such as delaying second doses or mixing different types of vaccines. So the joke is that if the booster is part of these ""rules"", then the CDC and FDA would ignore the WHO.

There's also a partly serious argument about who is ""fully vaccinated"". People calling them boosters view us more as already fully vaccinated, able to live life to the fullest but that a booster might change percentages a few points. This view is more favorable to the WHO that taking boosters is immoral. On the other hand, people calling them a third shot view us more as partially vaccinated, where we still have a moral obligation to minimize contacts and wear masks because vaccinated people can still spread the disease and through cascading effects cause hospitals to become full. This is a much more complicated situation, where you could argue that a country's responsibility is to its own citizens first even if they could help another country a bit more.",,,,1631131229,{},hc3lf1x,False,t3_pkf8cf,False,True,t1_hc3dsq6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pkf8cf/who_chief_urges_halt_to_booster_shots_for_rest_of/hc3lf1x/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,78faf6b7b00ff59bcee6a4d59ab3602108dc3735,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1631131249.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

[],,ChillTownAVE,,,[],,,,text,t2_jp9rr,False,False,[],"While the type of work and industry certainly makes a difference, collaboration as a reason for being in the office has always been a hard sell for me. I think the issue is a lot of companies are still not adept at setting remote workers up for success. There also is a distinct lack of effort put forth by some in mamagement to adapt to the current technology.

 I work in a field that has been deemed essential for hybrid in-office work. There is very little change in productivity, collaboration, meeting effectiveness yet those are the reasons I hear as to why fully remote working is not possible. We live in a world where we are constantly connected and communicating with people through the screens and technology we use. Yet when it comes to work white boards, water cooler talk and in-person meetings are the only way forward? The data simply isn't there when it comes to remote work driving lack of productivity and teamwork. The opposite has proved to be true. 

My final thought is this: for those that enjoy certain aspects of coming into the office, they should be given that opportunity. But the same should be done for those who enjoy working remotely. Hybrid-remote, to me, is still in-office work. But that should also be an option. We shouldn't be viewing this as an either or, one side wins situation. All three options should be available moving forward, and a focus on how companies can encourage continued collaboration is essential.

The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant was first identified in the state of Maharashtra in late 2020 and spread throughout India, outcompeting pre-existing lineages including B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and B.1.1.7 (Alpha)1. In vitro, B.1.617.2 is 6-fold less sensitive to serum neutralising antibodies from recovered individuals, and 8-fold less sensitive to vaccine-elicited antibodies as compared to wild type (WT) Wuhan-1 bearing D614G. Serum neutralising titres against B.1.617.2 were lower in ChAdOx-1 versus BNT162b2 vaccinees. B.1.617.2 spike pseudotyped viruses exhibited compromised sensitivity to monoclonal antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD) and N- terminal domain (NTD). B.1.617.2 demonstrated higher replication efficiency in both airway organoid and human airway epithelial systems compared to B.1.1.7, associated with B.1.617.2 spike in a predominantly cleaved state compared to B.1.1.7. The B.1.617.2 spike protein was able to mediate highly efficient syncytium formation that was less sensitive to inhibition by neutralising antibody as compared to WT spike. Additionally we observed that B.1.617.2 had higher replication and spike mediated entry as compared to B.1.617.1, potentially explaining B.1.617.2 dominance. In an analysis of over 130 SARS-CoV-2 infected healthcare workers across three centres in India during a period of mixed lineage circulation, we observed reduced ChAdOx-1 vaccine effectiveness against B.1.617.2 relative to non- B.1.617.2, with the caveat of possible residual confounding. Compromised vaccine efficacy against the highly fit and immune evasive B.1.617.2 Delta variant warrants continued infection control measures in the post-vaccination era.",,,,1631123705,{},hc333jw,True,t3_pkfkyk,False,False,t3_pkfkyk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pkfkyk/sarscov2_b16172_delta_variant_replication_and/hc333jw/,1631203284.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

TL:DR; as Delta became increasingly prelavant, Moderna was 76% effective at stopping infection, while Pfizer dropped to 42%. 

(Results we‚Äôre different in other states/regions where the study looked, but Moderna always came out on top).

This is kind of a false equivalence though cuz these particular mRNA vaccines are ""new tech"", and haven't been tested for the long term effects in humans. Nor has any of the previously studied mRNA tech ever been tested in humans (until the mass rollout in the middle of a pandemic). And the ones that were tested on animals for similar virus had bleak long term outcomes.

&gt;IF we can get more and more data to stress the point that these vaccines are safe, especially in the long run, then maybe the vaxx-hesitant can stop being so hesitant and finally get vaxxed. 

But see here's my problem with this statement. Don't you think it would've been better to get the longterm data first, before rushed mass rollouts in the middle of a pandemic?

The 7+ days in a row of -40 also gets old quick - I'd rather have snow then that cold (it's to cold to snow at that point). Like the air is so cold it takes your breath away at first and then it almost hurts to inhale.

But, survive that and you'll be like the rest of us - in hoodies once it hits 25, or like the crazy people here who sport shorts once it hits 30.

The feeling of perpetual darkness is the worse then the extreme cold imo. The amazing greenification that happens in spring and the absolutely brilliant fall colors make the winters bearable though.

Instead of humans selecting less severe mutations to replicate, the virus just spits out whatever mutations occur. The virus itself isn‚Äôt selecting any mutations.

The Chinese government was *saying* nonsense officially, and were publishing implausibly low case numbers. It is arguable whether that was due to lack of testing, early incompetence of the regional government, or active cover-up, but it‚Äôs kind of irrelevant (at the beginning of the pandemic I thought the misleading numbers were nefarious but after seeing how incompetence, poor coordination, and lack of resources led to gross underestimation of case numbers around the world, I can‚Äôt really say the Chinese did unusually poorly by world standards, or even by the standards set by some parts of the USA).

But from their actions and from widely available information coming unofficially out of China, it was abundantly clear by the end of January that (a) Covid was an incredible threat and (b) the Chinese national government was taking Covid incredibly seriously. They shut down much of the national economy, shifted a huge number of medical personnel from across the country to address the situation in a single province, built temporary hospitals at insane speed, tried to source N95 masks from anywhere in the world a spare one could be found and dramatically retooled local factories to make masks and various other things, invoked national emergency powers (of a scope unprecedented in the history of public health) to shut down internal and external transportation, force social distancing, quarantine the sick, etc.

There were pictures of enormous rooms full of extremely sick people, videos people dying in the street, teams of workers in hazmat suits disinfecting the streets, videos of people getting barricaded into their own apartments, etc. etc.

Yes, theoretically the vaccine introduces a selective pressure on the virus to mutate to escape it. But this is not the full story, and I think the original commenter was quite irresponsible in how they presented it, for a couple of reasons.  First, the vaccine reduces viral loads and the ability of the virus to replicate, which means there are orders of magnitude fewer opportunities for mutations to occur. Next, mutations would have to occur in arguably the most important protein of the virus to circumvent the vaccine. But with all biological systems, it‚Äôs way way easier and more likely to introduce mutations that break things than it is to introduce mutations to make things better. With fewer opportunities to replicate and a case where small mutations are more likely to destroy the virus than they are to help, it likely would take a heck of a long time to circumvent the vaccine. But there‚Äôs more! Let‚Äôs say that the virus gets a mutation that beats the antibodies. There is still no guarantee that that variant can enter cells as efficiently to infect people. Those are two different interactions that are really hard to balance. But let‚Äôs say a variant succeeds at everything. We have another trick up our sleeve: the groundbreaking RNA vaccine technology. With that we can make fresh vaccines for variants very quickly and have our next tool for fighting a changing virus. You may think we constantly need updated vaccines, but that‚Äôs how we handle flu vaccines! Yes it‚Äôs another thing to do, but it works wonders! 

To add some credibility, I have a Ph.D. in protein biochemistry, which is why I focused here on changing protein/protein interactions and evolution. I hope this helps alleviate some concerns.

For how long? Given that Delta requires a high antibody titers to prevent infection, I am not convinced Delta will run out of new hosts because it will be able to reinfect the same hosts after antibodies wane in 10+ weeks. Of course, we need the data on this. But to me looking at population seroprevalence is insufficient if Delta and its children all require high antibody titers to prevent infection, and just like the common cold it's possible to keep getting infected/re-infected. Hopefully the T/B cell immunity helps keep these cases less severe, but there isn't a great solution to debilitating long covid yet other than not getting infected in the first place (it's unclear if the 50% of long covid reduction we are seeing in vaccines is due to high antibody titers or not).",,,,1631054969,{},hbznhcp,False,t3_pjv22q,False,False,t1_hbzb0r8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pjv22q/covid19_infected_many_more_americans_in_2020_than/hbznhcp/,1631133273.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Frankly, I don't see why NZ should listen to other countries who have failed to keep their people safe.

Our economy is hot, we have full employment (and labour shortages), and we did it without having to sacrifice a lot of people.

There are three main divisions: droplet, aerosol and airborne. Measles is airborne. It is a much smaller lump of genetic material, and can float indefinitely in the air. The flu is likely droplet. Heavier chunks of material that fall quickly out of the air.  
  
Covid19 is still thought to be dominated by droplet transmission. However, recent evidence suggests that in certain settings, it can also be considered aerosol (while still predominantly droplet). This does _not_ make it an airborne classified virus.

If you look at the DNA (or RNA or whatever the viruses carry) transcription factors that viruses use and compare them to humans, viruses tend to make much more mistakes due to something we call sloppy polymerase (or at least we do in the Netherlands), this is likely an evolutionary benefit because it allows the virus to evolve and adapt faster. So essentially yes, viruses mutated into mutating faster.

Can it go much faster than it is now? I think that's unlikely. The virus has come to a point of balance. If it would mutate more too many ""offspring"" viruses would just be out of order and it wouldn't be worth the ability to mutate faster.

He in the past has mentioned people just need to be healthy and eat right with exercise and not worry about it. Yet this same man had a covid plan in place in case he got it? This plan included medical care and treatment that 95% of his listeners are not going to have ready available access to. He literally said he got fever, new what it was and got tested + treatment going the next day without leaving his house.  
 On top of dismissal of how serious covid can be, and how serious he must have taken to be prepped for it, he defends Ivermectin (which is fine imo) but does not clearly emphasize that this is Human ivermectin, and that people should not go buy horse paste. 

Did the media pick on him? Absolutely, just like they pick on any celebrity or famous person   if they can make a story out if it.

[],,jacobolus,,,[],,,,text,t2_2ztg,False,True,,"&gt; We had scientists in that lab at that time too

There is very little evidence for the lab-leak hypothesis of the virus‚Äôs origins. It can‚Äôt be ruled out and there is still significant uncertainty about exactly how the virus first evolved, but most experts lean toward the hypothesis that the virus arose naturally by jumping from bat to human, possibly via some intermediate host.

&gt; WHO dropped the ball on some level 

The WHO was put in a very rough political position, especially once the US president started trashing it to deflect blame from himself. Overall WHO has performed about as expected: it has been very helpful coordinating international responses, but could certainly be better. But the WHO per se has limited power or authority; blaming the WHO is more or less the same as blaming member countries for not doing a better job working together.

&gt; Trump (and even Biden) isn‚Äôt a scientist or a doctor

How did you figure that out? Was it the recommendation for people to drink bleach and do lightbulb enemas? The proposal to just nuke hurricanes? Or the part where he repeatedly trashed the scientific and medical communities?

&gt; Fauci and the other scientists, including the CDC itself, are not public speakers. [...] they should not be giving policy advice.

Dr. Fauci‚Äôs job duties consist of (a) directing medical research into infectious diseases, (b) giving policy advice to America‚Äôs political leadership, and (c) giving information to the public.

&gt; FDA is a heap of shit [...] They need to [...] get out of the way.

This is a really bad take. And this attitude is the direct cause of most current societal problems.

&gt; Vaccines would have been super effective containing this way back in April or may of last year

Vaccines cannot be rolled out to the entire US or world population without substantial evidence from large-scale clinical trials demonstrating safety and effectiveness. The vaccines we have were rolled out faster than any past vaccines in history: the companies making them got special dispensation to do multiple stages of the process concurrently rather than serially (as is usually done), but there is only so much you can speed the process up without compromising it.

Arguably the FDA should have a more radically different relaxed set of rules during a pandemic compared to normal times, and we should have a different standard for both safety and efficacy when we think that a large proportion of unvaccinated are likely to get sick, but that‚Äôs something we can argue about changing for next time, not something that could easily be changed on the fly in 2020.

Personally I think the biggest fuckups at the FDA were not more quickly authorizing instant, ideally at-home Covid tests. Instead of insisting that a test have sufficient accuracy to make perfect clinical decisions, the goal in a pandemic should be to get people tested as easily and often as possible so that most of the sick can be identified and quarantined with their contacts traced ASAP.

The WHO has in no way concluded ""this may marginally help maybe possibly"", in fact the WHO recommends ivermectin ONLY be used to treat covid within clinical trials. There is currently zero compelling evidence that ivermectin is effective in treating covid, and as more and more data comes out it's looking even less promising.

The ""studies"" showing promising results for ivermectin have largely been refuted/debunked. To my knowledge, [this is the paper that kicked it off.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302011) It did show promising results, but those results haven't been replicated outside of a petri dish. There were several early clinical trials, the most successful of which being [the Egypt study](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-100956/v4). You'll notice you can't actually read that study in the journal because it was retracted for plagiarism and data fabrication. It's not just the Egypt study though, [here's another paper](https://medicalpressopenaccess.com/upload/1629625741_1007.pdf) claiming a 100% success rate in preventing covid. Except [the numbers just don't add up.](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/ivermectin-covid-study-suspect-data) A separate, [positive review](https://blog.frontiersin.org/2021/03/02/2-march-2021-media-statement/) of all the data on ivermectin was rejected from a journal after provisional acceptance for concerns about research integrity and conflicts of interest. Here's a [strict meta-analysis](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD015017.pub2/full?cookiesEnabled) of **all** the randomized, controlled trials of ivermectin against covid. Spoiler:&gt;! It found no positive effect for the drug. !&lt;

It's worth saying that I do appreciate the spirit of your comment. I have people in my life that are equally irrational, and no amount of scientific fact is going to change their mind (trust me I've tried).

&gt;Its data shows that more than a quarter of weekly reported coronavirus cases in the United States were among children for the week ending Sept. 2.

I will agree with this.

But disagree with this. There is no amount of public education (as we currently have, or as you're describing) that will fix this problem. Science is hard, medical ethics are hard, public policy is hard, human tendencies are hard. Even if we re-structure our public education system around these ideas the problem won't be solved (though we should still do those things).

What we need is to rebuild our communities. We need more focus on community leaders, adult education, community ethics, and information flow. All the social problems we have are going to be complicated and nuanced and we're not going to be able to school ourselves out of it.

&gt;And when at science class, if you think ""when will I ever need to use this in my life?""

The solution to this mess doesn't lie in science class. It lies in the art classes. In communications, in writing, in history, in philosophy, in all the ways where we learn how to understand how other humans work, and how we can learn how to make and reinforce social systems that insulate us from con men and grifters.

‚ÄúRead responds: ‚ÄúWe're talking a very different virus and very different vaccines. The details in biology really matter a lot. The chicken vaccines we worked with, the first-generation vaccine, definitely reduced disease, severity and death.‚Äù But unlike the COVID mRNA vaccines, the chicken vaccine ‚Äúdidn't stop transmission at all.‚Äù And this is one of the key differences between what was being studied in Read‚Äôs paper and our current situation with the global pandemic. ‚ÄúThose [vaccinated] chickens just kept churning out the virus for weeks and weeks and weeks.‚Äù Again, this is a key difference. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very different virus from SARS-2. A key issue here is transmissibility.‚Äù

More transmission increases the likelihood of mutation. Thankfully, COVID-19 Vaccines reduce transmission and reduce opportunity for mutation.

‚ÄúThink about what's happening with evolution,‚Äù offers Read. ‚ÄúMutations can occur anytime the [virus] replicates. So the more replication, the more variants are generated. At the moment, the vast majority of the replication is happening in unvaccinated people. You can tell that because the majority of cases in the hospital are unvaccinated individuals. That is where the evolutionary action is happening at the moment.‚Äù 

Are mRNA vaccines ‚Äòleaky‚Äô?

Rogan seems to think that mRNA vaccines are quite leaky because of breakthrough infections. Read points out that no vaccine is 100% effective. Although we still need more data to determine how leaky they are, the rate of breakthrough infections in vaccinated people remains statistically low enough to consider the mRNA vaccines highly effective at preventing infection.

‚ÄúWe don't know at the moment how leaky these things are. It's conceivable that they are actually close to non-leaky. I'm amazed how good these mRNA vaccines are. They're incredibly good.‚Äù

Read‚Äôs very concerned that misrepresentation of his research is causing vaccine hesitancy.

‚ÄúThe study was tweeted a thousand times last night, according to our metrics,‚Äù says Read. ‚ÄúI had a physician in England reach out to me on Friday asking me to [clarify] because his patients are using my paper to argue against vaccination.‚Äù Calling into question the effectiveness of vaccines was never the intention of his 2015 study. ‚ÄúI am genuinely shocked. I've been doing work for 20 years now on how vaccines might drive the evolution of viruses. There's nothing in any of that 20 years work that argues in favor of withholding lifesaving vaccines. It's just shocking to me.‚Äù He adds, ‚ÄúThere are 600,000 Americans dead so far. The vast majority of those deaths are vaccine-preventable. There's not a single scenario that would argue in favor of not using [vaccines] to save the next hundred thousand. Not one scenario.‚Äù",,,,1631130371,{},hc3japj,True,t3_pkaf14,False,True,t3_pkaf14,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pkaf14/joe_rogan_is_getting_this_completely_wrong_says/hc3japj/,,1,True,True,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,795faf59ccf892ee71c1dcecd2ded9dee0d52ac4,True,False,,0.0,moderator,0.0,1631130383.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Your typical commercial building only turns over outside air one every half hour.

We'll see how areas do where school opened yesterday. There is almost certainly going to be a surge of cases from that. But given the level of vaccination I think there will be very little increase in hospitalization and fatalities.

There is pretty good data that the wave is cresting in most parts of the country, even those with low levels of vaccination. I don't think this gets enough attention because it's crucial, you have areas with 30-50% vaccination still seeing cases decline.

They may, they may not.  Big business has often done worse.  While not a maintenance issue, look at how Boeing shot their own foot/rep - hundreds died.  And while I don't mean to paint with a broad 1st world brush, hasn't a lot of airline maintenance been offshored?  Yes, the critical stuff is probably taken seriously but if you can't picture a harried maintenance tech (who thinks covid is just a flu) taking a non-critical short cut...

You write very authoritatively and that's nice but the world is not as clear cut as
you often proclaim.  I doubt you have done much hands on maintenance.  

And a high air turnover rate also means relatively high air velocities and mixing.  So if I happen to be sitting near an anti-vaxer with a fake vax card and nose exposed or loosely covered, their cooties will be flying past me faster so the air current / impingement protection from regular eye glasses or a face shield will be reduced - hence goggles.    And what if I happen to be near a carrier of the next variant- low odds?  Sure but still that's why I'm taking an extra precaution...

For me, air travel represents the highest risk - I work from home.   So thank you for having so much confidence in aircraft maintenance but I shall spend $20 (looking more like ~$10) on some goggles.

So here's another aspect we haven't touched on - does the relatively low humidity / pressure of an airliner cabin increase or decrease the likelihood of covid infection via lungs or eyes?

Its partly joking about how the CDC has been insisting 3rd shots for immunocompromised are NOT boosters, but rather a delayed part of the normal series. I assume they do it because doing so emphasizes that immunocompromised are not getting more than other people by getting a third shot, but rather just reaching what they should have gotten with two shots and to emphases the importance of this group getting the extra shot. 

But I don't really consider 2-doses fully vaccinated for the purposes of controlling the disease anymore (although I think its reasonable for the CDC/FDA to wait for more clinical data before saying such). As long as there is a large portion of the population who have not even gotten their two doses, controlling the spread of the disease is important to protecting them. If the US was like those countries who are at like 80% 2-shots and over 90% of eligible people with 1 shot, then boosters wouldn't be that important.

Considering the vast majority of deaths include other comorbities, winter has always been the most dangerous time for people for covid 19. I also suspect that cold means more indoor activities as opposed to outdoor, and this may make spread a lot worse, as well. 

Plus, things like coughing is natural in cold weather, and as such, it's easier to spread the virus even if asymptomatic by just reacting to weather.

&gt;The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare quietly enacted the move Monday and publicly announced it in a statement Tuesday morning ‚Äî warning residents that they may not get the care they would normally expect if they need to be hospitalized.

&gt;The move came as the state's confirmed coronavirus cases skyrocketed in recent weeks. Idaho has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S.

&gt;The state health agency cited ‚Äúa severe shortage of staffing and available beds in the northern area of the state caused by a massive increase in patients with COVID-19 who require hospitalization.‚Äù

&gt;The designation includes 10 hospitals and healthcare systems in the Idaho panhandle and in north-central Idaho. The agency said its goal is to extend care to as many patients as possible and to save as many lives as possible.

&gt;The move allows hospitals to allot scarce resources like intensive care unit rooms to patients most likely to survive and make other dramatic changes to the way they treat patients. Other patients will still receive care, but they may be placed in hospital classrooms or conference rooms rather than traditional hospital rooms or go without some life-saving medical equipment.

&gt;Other states are preparing to take similar measures if needed. Hawaii Gov. David Ige quietly signed an order last week releasing hospitals and health care workers from liability if they have to ration health care.

&gt;The unfolding crush of patients to Idaho hospitals has been anticipated with dread by the state's heath care providers. Medical experts have said that Idaho could have as many as 30,000 new coronavirus cases a week by mid-September if the current rate of infections lasts.

&gt;‚ÄúCrisis standards of care is a last resort. It means we have exhausted our resources to the point that our healthcare systems are unable to provide the treatment and care we expect,‚Äù Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen said in a statement.

&gt;He added: ‚ÄúThis is a decision I was fervently hoping to avoid. The best tools we have to turn this around is for more people to get vaccinated and to wear masks indoors and in outdoor crowded public places. Please choose to get vaccinated as soon as possible ‚Äì it is your very best protection against being hospitalized from COVID-19.‚Äù

&gt;The designation will remain in effect until there are enough resources ‚Äî including staffing, hospital beds and equipment or a drop in the number of patients ‚Äî to provide normal levels of treatment to all.

&gt;More than 500 people were hospitalized statewide with COVID-19 on Sept. 1 and more than a third of them were in intensive care unit beds.

&gt;Idaho's hospitals have struggled to fill empty nursing, housekeeping and other health care positions, in part because some staffers have left because they are burned out by the strain of the pandemic and because others have been quarantined because they were exposed to COVID-19.

&gt;Late last month, Little called in 220 medical workers available through federal programs and mobilized 150 Idaho National Guard soldiers to help hospitals cope with the surge.

&gt;Two hundred of the federal workers are medical and administrative staffers available through a contract with the U.S. General Services Administration. The U.S. Department of Defense agreed to send a 20-person medical response team to northern Idaho. The Idaho National Guard soldiers will help with logistical support such as screenings and lab work.

&gt;On Tuesday, the governor called the move to limit care ‚Äúan unprecedented and unwanted point in the history of our state‚Äù and urged residents to get vaccinated against coronavirus.

&gt;Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that full vaccination with any of the currently available coronavirus vaccines dramatically reduces the risk of requiring hospitalization for a coronavirus infection.

&gt;‚ÄúMore Idahoans need to choose to receive the vaccine so we can minimize the spread of the disease and reduce the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations, many of which involve younger Idahoans and are preventable with safe and effective vaccines,‚Äù said Little, who is a Republican.

&gt;When the pandemic first came to Idaho at the start of 2020, Little ordered a partial shutdown of the state ‚Äî ordering some businesses to temporarily close or shift to take-out style services, banning some large gatherings and asking residents to stay home as much as possible.

&gt;The move was aimed at ensuring that hospitals wouldn't become overwhelmed by patients. Idaho was on the verge of enacting crisis standards of care during a major coronavirus surge last winter, but narrowly avoided doing so ‚Äî making this the first time the state has taken the drastic measure.

&gt;Little reopened the state in stages over a period of several months and has not reimposed restrictions limiting gatherings. Businesses are mostly operating as normal.

&gt;The state's crisis guidelines are complex, and give hospitals a legal and ethical template to use while rationing care.

&gt;Under the guidelines, patients are given priority scores based on a number of factors that impact their likelihood of surviving a health crisis.

&gt;Those deemed in most in need of care and most likely to benefit from it are put on priority lists for scarce resources like ICU beds.

&gt;Others in dire need but with lower chances of surviving will be given ‚Äúcomfort care‚Äù to help keep them pain-free whether they succumb to their illnesses or recover.

&gt;Other patients with serious but not life-threatening medical problems will face delays in receiving care until resources are available.

&gt;‚ÄúI hope that your takeaway from this is that the vaccines work. They are the best tool by far that we have,‚Äù to keep people from getting seriously sick from the coronavirus, said Jeppesen, the state health department director.

&gt;The demand on hospitals is likely to increase in coming weeks as case numbers continue to climb, Jeppesen said, so everyone should take steps to avoid needing any emergency care if possible by wearing seatbelts, taking medication as prescribed and reconsidering activities like riding bikes that can lead to accidents.",,,,1631072281,{},hc0nkzr,True,t3_pk2p78,False,False,t3_pk2p78,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pk2p78/idaho_hospitals_begin_rationing_health_care_amid/hc0nkzr/,1631154939.0,54,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

2) Texas keeps voting for politicians who make attacks on the program (Republicans).  For example, the Trump (whom Texans voted for) tried to cut the WIC budget in his last budget:

[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/16/trump-budget-wic-women-infants-children-nutrition](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/16/trump-budget-wic-women-infants-children-nutrition)

&gt;The preliminary budget proposal released by the Trump White House on Thursday calls for cuts to a program aimed at improving nutrition among low-income women and children, potentially placing some of its key programs in jeopardy. The cuts proposed are similar to those sought in recent years by House Republicans as they targeted social welfare programs for federal savings.  
&gt;  
&gt;Trump‚Äôs budget proposes to cut the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC, from $6.4bn to $6.2bn. The program, which is aimed at reducing infant and maternal mortality and morbidity, provides food vouchers for low-income pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children under five years old, as well as breastfeeding support and nutrition education.

3) Texas Representatives keep voting against help for pregnant women. Look at how many Texas Republicans voted against the the ""Pregnant Workers Fairness Act"" (H.R. 2694) last year, for example:

[],,Methratis,,,[],,,,text,t2_a3g8xgwn,False,False,,"Mutations are a valid concern but there seems to be a misunderstanding (including unfortunately with many experts) caused by comparing Flu vaccines with COVID vaccines.  I'll copy&amp;paste a response I just wrote to another comment as it overlaps with this subject:

The Flu vaccines are very weak compared to the COVID vaccines. They don't produce any T cell response, hardly any B cell response and only low levels of antibodies. So if the surface of the virus looks slightly different due to antigenic drift (mutations), the antibodies won't bind as well any more and you are left more or less unprotected. The COVID vaccines on the other hand produce much higher levels of antibodies but also strong B cell and T cell responses. B cell and T cell responses last much longer. Possibly decades. So even if the surface of the virus looks different due to antigenic drift, you are still protected from severe disease due to B and T cell protection.  
  
It is this kind of ill-founded comparison with flu vaccines and a lack of understanding of antigenic drift and the role of the various parts of our immune system that IMO is causing a lot of the discussions and fear we currently see. 

I'll copy&amp;paste the second part of my other comment as it also applies here and indicates that a single booster shot could set most of us up for broad and long term protection against variants and even other coronavrius outbreaks:

""As for pancovid vaccines, we already know that people previously infected that get the current mRNA vaccine shots produce antibody protection against not only all currently known variants of SARS-CoV-2 but also antibodies that bind to SARS-CoV-1 and also for instance the RaTG13 bat coronavirus and a Pangolin coronavirus (I can't remember the name). We also see that a third mRNA booster shot in people that are SARS-CoV-2 naive (they have not (yet) been infected) produce a much broader antibody spectrum.  
  
In other words, it seems we already have long lasting pancovid vaccines.""

&amp;#x200B;

[],,LeRatslayer,,,[],,,,text,t2_jc1q6,False,False,[],"The thing is that many things in science are not proven yet, especially anything related to COVID. That's why most scientists, when talking about anything related to this pandemic, sound unsure - there is a lot of shit they don't know. Even with stuff like masks, for a long time we didn't know if they did anything or not. 

And that is fine - science will eventually figure all this stuff out. But we need to make decisions now, based on incomplete and unproven data. What that means is that this becomes a question of belief - do you trust these numbers that scientists put forward and do you trust those odds that they give you, or do you trust some shit that someone made up on youtube for clicks?

The answer is very personal for many people. There are many reasons one might choose to mistrust the scientists. I've run into many people who, when presented with scientific data, just say ""I don't trust this data!"". And no amount of reasoning managed to convince them. They just have their own personal preconceived notions about the scientific community, that are really hard to break.

That's why you need to foster belief in scientists. You need to make people comfortable with the idea that there are many things we don't know for sure, but we still have a very good estimate at what the right decision might be. The best argument you can make to all those people is ""If thousands of scientists independently reach the same conclusion and have the same data, that means that this conclusion/data is very likely to be right."" But people aren't used to the uncertainty, the scientific process and all that stuff. They'd rather trust someone who is 100% of some bullshit he made up, than trust someone who rigorously verifies all his claim and therefor sounds a bit unsure of himself.",,,,1631107066,{},hc2006o,False,t3_pjsvg0,False,True,t1_hc0vt77,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pjsvg0/why_vaccine_skeptics_are_all_in_on_ivermectin/hc2006o/,1631180502.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

(2) The Delta variant (first noticed in India), which is significantly more transmissible than the original version of Covid or the Alpha variant.

If you look around the USA, counties are having cases, hospitalizations, and deaths more or less inversely proportional to the vaccination rate. Compare orange and green maps: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html

So here in San Francisco and the Bay Area, the Delta variant blazed through part of the unvaccinated population but has hit a wall and is on the run. Unless the virus evolves to escape the vaccines, we will probably have another few dozen deaths and maybe in the hundreds of hospitalizations here, but nothing too extraordinary compared to other diseases. As soon as 5‚Äì12 year olds can be vaccinated the pandemic will pretty much be over here, and life can fully return to normal.

By contrast, in rural GOP-leaning counties near the California‚ÄìOregon border, or in GOP-leaning counties in the CA central valley, they have a low vaccination rate (30‚Äì40%) and Delta is a nightmare: no hospital beds left, lots of really sick people, school outbreaks causing quarantines and closures, medical workers who are completely exhausted and exasperated, etc.",,,,1631115878,{},hc2k2s3,False,t3_pjsm97,False,True,t1_hc1s3kg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pjsm97/who_says_covid_will_mutate_like_the_flu_and_is/hc2k2s3/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,3003216bce7d4619ad83e7a955b8054432999af5,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1631115892.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Vermont is drowning under its pension obligations. The top pension recipients are Judges and State Troopers. State troopers retire at 50, with a pension that is 50% of their top 2 years salary. If they don't get promoted ever, that's a 50k lifetime pension starting at 50 years old. If you do a good job and get promoted, you can retire with more than double that. Based on the pensions VT currently pays, many troopers retire young and with significant pensions.

On top of that, despite all the thin blue line bullshit, VT state trooper is a very safe job. They rarely die on the job, and if they do, it's because they crash their cruiser, not because they got shot. It's far safer than, say, farming in Vermont.

Lot's of law enforcement jobs are actually quite safe, and offer great benefit packages.

The issue is, scientists are very careful to present findings in a way which allows thier findings to be viewed, understood and thier experiments replicated for verification. They don't deal in absolutes.

Tylenol can potentially be very dangerous to those with allergies or sensitivities so I guess nobody should ever speak about taking it, correct? There should always be a level of personal accountability when taking medications and taking sincere medical advice from someone not classically trained comes with risks. Also is it possible for you to cite where he endorsed medication and the manner in how he prescribed it?

Rabies. It's exceptionally common, but people just don't run into the animals that carry it often. Skunks especially, and bats.

Let me paint you a picture.

You go camping, and at midday you decide to take a nap in a nice little hammock. While sleeping, a tiny brown bat, in the ""rage"" stages of infection is fidgeting in broad daylight, uncomfortable, and thirsty (due to the hydrophobia) and you snort, startling him. He goes into attack mode.

Except you're asleep, and he's a little brown bat, so weighs around 6 grams. You don't even feel him land on your bare knee, and he starts to bite. His teeth are tiny. Hardly enough to even break the skin, but he does manage to give you the equivalent of a tiny scrape that goes completely unnoticed.

Rabies does not travel in your blood. In fact, a blood test won't even tell you if you've got it. (Antibody tests may be done, but are useless if you've ever been vaccinated.)

You wake up, none the wiser. If you notice anything at the bite site at all, you assume you just lightly scraped it on something.

The bomb has been lit, and your nervous system is the wick. The rabies will multiply along your nervous system, doing virtually no damage, and completely undetectable. You literally have NO symptoms.

It may be four days, it may be a year, but the camping trip is most likely long forgotten. Then one day your back starts to ache... Or maybe you get a slight headache?

At this point, you're already dead. There is no cure.

(The sole caveat to this is the Milwaukee Protocol, which leaves most patients dead anyway, and the survivors mentally disabled, and is seldom done).

There's no treatment. It has a 100% kill rate.

Absorb that. Not a single other virus on the planet has a 100% kill rate. Only rabies. And once you're symptomatic, it's over. You're dead.

So what does that look like?

Your headache turns into a fever, and a general feeling of being unwell. You're fidgety. Uncomfortable. And scared. As the virus that has taken its time getting into your brain finds a vast network of nerve endings, it begins to rapidly reproduce, starting at the base of your brain... Where your ""pons"" is located. This is the part of the brain that controls communication between the rest of the brain and body, as well as sleep cycles.

Next you become anxious. You still think you have only a mild fever, but suddenly you find yourself becoming scared, even horrified, and it doesn't occur to you that you don't know why. This is because the rabies is chewing up your amygdala.

As your cerebellum becomes hot with the virus, you begin to lose muscle coordination, and balance. You think maybe it's a good idea to go to the doctor now, but assuming a doctor is smart enough to even run the tests necessary in the few days you have left on the planet, odds are they'll only be able to tell your loved ones what you died of later.

You're twitchy, shaking, and scared. You have the normal fear of not knowing what's going on, but with the virus really fucking the amygdala this is amplified a hundred fold. It's around this time the hydrophobia starts.

You're horribly thirsty, you just want water. But you can't drink. Every time you do, your throat clamps shut and you vomit. This has become a legitimate, active fear of water. You're thirsty, but looking at a glass of water begins to make you gag, and shy back in fear. The contradiction is hard for your hot brain to see at this point. By now, the doctors will have to put you on IVs to keep you hydrated, but even that's futile. You were dead the second you had a headache.

You begin hearing things, or not hearing at all as your thalamus goes. You taste sounds, you see smells, everything starts feeling like the most horrifying acid trip anyone has ever been on. With your hippocampus long under attack, you're having trouble remembering things, especially family.

You're alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, and absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares the literal shit out of you at this point. These strange people in lab coats. These strange people standing around your bed crying, who keep trying to get you ""drink something"" and crying. And it's only been about a week since that little headache that you've completely forgotten. Time means nothing to you anymore. Funny enough, you now know how the bat felt when he bit you.

Eventually, you slip into the ""dumb rabies"" phase. Your brain has started the process of shutting down. Too much of it has been turned to liquid virus. Your face droops. You drool. You're all but unaware of what's around you. A sudden noise or light might startle you, but for the most part, it's all you can do to just stare at the ground. You haven't really slept for about 72 hours.

Then you die. Always, you die.

And there's not one... fucking... thing... anyone can do for you.

Then there's the question of what to do with your corpse. I mean, sure, burying it is the right thing to do. But the fucking virus can survive in a corpse for years. You could kill every rabid animal on the planet today, and if two years from now, some moist, preserved, rotten hunk of used-to-be brain gets eaten by an animal, it starts all over.

So yeah, rabies scares the shit out of me. And it's fucking EVERYWHERE. (Source: Spent a lot of time working with rabies.

At least with only two doses and Delta. The limited data we do have about third shots is that they do seem to provide at least short-term immunity against even asymptomatic (detectible) infection from Delta. Not that its a guarantee even then, but its enough to give herd immunity (if people would get their shots or if there were not shortages depending on the location) unlike 2-shot series.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Too many people are putting too much emphasis on vaccinations while roaming around freely and letting their guard down. As though - vaccinations are a magic ticket to freedom for all.

Especially those people who are most at risk. Its unfortunate that the messaging that ""if you are vaccinated, you can unmask or go back to do group activities"" right before Delta reached hear was not strongly countered with the message that it was no longer reasonable advice. Not that the original advice made sense for people 70+ in the first place when there were still several million active cases in the country. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Social distancing, suppression and mask wearing need to continue for a minimum 6 months to a year longer for all of us to have any hope of eradicating much of the dangers associated here.

Some people would find it easier to put up with restriction if they were tied to specific goals  set at the national level (to be adjusted when variants change). The challenge is there would have to be a multiple criteria that go into the decision: hospital stress, vaccination rates, new case numbers, active case numbers, previous infection immunity levels, etc. As a country, I don't think we have be at a point since March where it could be reasonable to have no restrictions yet. Even at the lowest point this year, there were still millions of people infected. Which should have  meant that at least the largest events should be requiring proof of vaccination and masks 

But there are parts of the country today who have good enough vaccination rates and low enough hospitalization rates that they could go to pretty limited restrictions (such a requiring vaccinations to go inside anywhere including schools and regular testing of staff and residents in long-term care facilities)",,,,1631120428,{},hc2v3w4,False,t3_pkbiw2,False,True,t1_hc2hlfl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pkbiw2/breakthrough_covid_cases_in_mass_at_about_40_of/hc2v3w4/,1631198095.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The danger with it being able to infect and spread through such a large number of animal populations is that it makes it virtually impossible to fully eradicate the virus since it'll always have stable host populations in nature. Another risk is that many of those animals, particularly wild animals like deer, bats, and rodents are also hosts to an unknown number of other coronaviruses that we don't even know about yet. As such, there is a risk that, lets say a NYC Sewer rat is infected with Covid as well as some yet unknown rat coronavirus that's similar enough to covid that the two viruses could swap some genes and the genes from the rat coronavirus, while being harmless to the rat, can cause even more severe illness in humans once it finds it's way back to infecting another human.

That's honestly a possible source of the SARS-2 virus to begin with, a bat or other mammal infected with one of their own coronaviruses got infected with one of the known or unknown human compatible coronaviruses, swapped some genes and we got ourselves a hybrid coronavirus that then goes on to cause the deadliest pandemic since 1918.",,,,1631126860,{},hc3aq9u,False,t3_pk5nkq,False,True,t1_hc1q5ho,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pk5nkq/mu_covid_variant_found_in_at_least_50_patients_at/hc3aq9u/,1631208113.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,
