There is also the chance that the vaccine will become yearly if variants continue as they are.  Thankfully though the overall side effect profile of the vaccines should get better as we improve them.

This is gen I, they work, but can have side effects.  Gen II will probably focus on keeping efficacy the same and improving side effects.  I fully believe that as this matures it will get better and it’s uses will widen past vaccines.

&gt;Considerable attention has been devoted to claims that SARS-CoV-2 was genetically engineered or adapted in cell culture or “humanized” animal models to promote human transmission57. Yet, since its  emergence,  SARS-CoV-2  has  experienced  repeated  sweeps  of  mutations  that  have increased viral fitness58,59. The first clear adaptive mutation, the D614G substitution in the spike protein, occurred early in the pandemic60,61. Recurring mutations in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein, including N501Y, K417N/T, L452R, and E484K/Q—constituent mutations of the  variants  of  concern—similarly  enhance  viral  infectivity54,55,62and  ACE2  binding53,63,  refuting claims that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was optimized for binding to human ACE2 upon its emergence56. Further, some pangolin-derived coronaviruses have receptor binding domains that are near-identical to SARS-CoV-2 at the amino acid level40,64and bind to human ACE2 even more strongly than SARS-CoV-2, showing that there is capacity for further human adaptation65. SARS-CoV-2  is  also  notable  for  being  a  host  generalist  virus66,  capable  of  efficient  transmission  in multiple mammalian species, including mink, tigers, cats, gorillas, dogs, raccoon dogs, ferrets, and  large  outbreaks  have been  documented  in  mink  with  spill-back  to  humans67and  to  other animals68. Combined, these findings show that no specific human “pre” adaptation was required for  the  emergence  or  early  spread  of  SARS-CoV-2,  and  the  claim  that  the  virus  was  already highly  adapted  to  the  human  host57,  or  somehow  optimized  for  binding  to  human  ACE2,  is without validity

This answers your question: 

&gt;How exactly does this mean anything?

which I had summarized for you:

&gt;Some people have argued that COVID is too optimal for human infection, as if it had been designed or passaged through human cells for optimum infectivity.

&gt;The argument being laid out in the statement is that the virus is continuing to become more optimal as the pandemic continues. You wouldn't expect that in a virus that has already been artificially optimized.

You have been enlightened.

That's a nope on suicides, everyone theorized that would happen, but it didn't.

Now, overdoses are definitely up.

My large, very populated county looks like it went up substantially percentage-wise. But, it went from 23 deaths to 33 deaths. My county didn't shutdown, bars stayed open. Clubs mostly stayed open. So, why did drug overdoses go up?

Honestly, I feel like part of it was the subsidies and extra unemployment money. For some people, that was more money than they'd ever had around here. People who couldn't afford to use regularly could suddenly afford more. AND, no, I don't think it's a good idea to just not give people money to avoid 10 additional people die of drug overdoses. Then we definitely would have had more suicides.

My county didn't have anything to be depressed about cause they didn't believe the pandemic was real and didn't shutdown and OD's went up as much as the areas that did shutdowns..

- Kids around 7th Grade and up have the opportunity to get vaccinated with Pfizer but most kids under that can’t get vaccinated at all. Couple that with the fact that a lot of parents are hesitant to vaccinate their kids likely means that more kids need to mask up than those who don’t 

- The vast majority of people making the aforementioned claim are also advocating for schools going completely maskless which is absolutely the farthest away from “following the science”. Reminds me of when Anti-Vaxxers demanding Gov. Newsom to drop the mask mandate early (he didn’t in the end) claiming that he wasn’t “following the science” when those same people intended to drop the mask while unvaccinated, the absolute opposite of what “the science” said. Absolutely hypocritical 

- The only way to 100% go into accordance with CDC guidelines would be to implement a vaccine verification system which not only would be a hassle, it would be even more controversial than the polices in place now. It makes sense for California to take the cautious route over the careless route even if they’re not in line with the CDC

1. The people with the highest risk of developing a severe case are all vaccinated in the Netherlands. People aged 60+, people with conditions, overweight people. The rest of the people is in the process of being vaccinated and will be so in about a month.

2. The people that are spreading the virus right now are young people (Assuming vaccinated people don't spread the virus as much). As far as I know, the risk is lower for young people.

3. It has been established that a fully vaccinated person can still get covid, but the severity will be less bad. As far as I know, this also is the case with the Delta type.

I conclude from this that the folllowing is happening:

A bunch of people are getting sick, but they don't end up in the hospital, because they are either young or fully vaccinated. Meaning *in theory* noone is really dying, right? Then what is the case against reopening?

Neither Denmark nor Ireland has had excess stock that was just waiting to be used.

Lots of countries were offered more than they bought from the beginning of the regular EU purchase program. Denmark was among the very few countries that from the start bought everything that was offered to them through the regular program. Most EU countries did not (but in fairness, it is likely that most expected that the deliveries, especially from AZ, would be more reliable than they ended up being). They were also one of the countries that consistently have been able to get more doses from each vial (one of the countries that discovered it and forwarded the data to ECDC). That's why Denmark, despite mostly not using AZ and J&amp;J, so far have been able to generally follow other EU countries in vaccination speed. It has nothing to do with the recent purchase outside the regular purchase program, which only will start to have an effect within the next couple of weeks (and in any case equal less than 5% of population fully vaccinated, not nearly enough to results in them going far ahead of others). With originally expected deliveries in this month, it actually looked like Denmark would start to fall a bit behind in speed soon, resulting in them being finished later. Because of the recent purchase, it now looks like the country will be able to continue without falling behind.

Regardless, all this is only relevant to speed of vaccination. It has absolutely nothing to do with the final vaccination percentage that various countries are going to reach. We can only guestimate the final percentage based on uptake in age groups that already have been offered and the many polls that have been conducted. When looking at those things, a number of northern European countries, incl. Ireland and Denmark, have quite consistently been near the top. Based on the polls, both Portugal and Spain are also likely to end up with high percentages. In the [last poll](https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/sites/default/files/ef_publication/field_ef_document/ef21064en.pdf
) conducted for the European Union, the percentages of people that were ""very likely"" or ""rather likely"" to get the vaccine in Portugal was the 4th highest among all 27 EU countries (page 17). Additionally, if looking at the ourworldindata [graph of first doses](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2020-02-29..latest&amp;pickerSort=asc&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;Metric=People+vaccinated&amp;Interval=New+per+day&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=~PRT), it is nice to see that Portugal still seems to be heading up with no indication of it slowing (as has been seen in the US and some other countries).",,,1626004772,{},h4strxd,False,t3_oho4ns,False,False,t1_h4sk9dh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oho4ns/in_portugal_70_of_the_adult_population_has_been/h4strxd/,1626175730,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Officials resorted to borrowing ventilators from other hospitals and pleaded on social media for help from respiratory therapists.

&gt;The run on ventilators subsided, but this week Mercy Springfield cared for more Covid patients than it has seen in any week since the pandemic started. The city is in Greene County, where only about 35 percent of residents have been fully vaccinated and the highly contagious Delta variant is spreading.

&gt;”Six weeks ago, we had 10 patients and now it’s 128 on Friday, which is greater than the third wave back in December,” said Dr. John Mohart, Mercy’s senior vice president of clinical services.

&gt;Missouri has been averaging about 1,000 new cases per day, a 44 percent increase over the past two weeks, though a fraction of the state’s November peak when its average topped 5,000, according to a New York Times database. Hospitalizations are up 25 percent from two weeks ago.

&gt;The Delta variant of the coronavirus has driven this outbreak in Missouri’s Southwest, around Springfield and Joplin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This week, an epidemiologist with the C.D.C. arrived in Springfield, as part of a “surge response team” requested by the state.

&gt;Delta became the dominant variant in the United States this week, accounting for about 52 percent of cases. The C.D.C. estimates the variant was behind nearly three-fourths of the new cases in Missouri.

&gt;Studies suggest that vaccines remain effective against the Delta variant. But public health experts say Delta poses a serious threat to unvaccinated populations, and studies suggest that a single shot of a two-dose vaccine regimen provides only weak protection against the variant.

&gt;At the same time, the gap in vaccination rates between counties that voted for Donald J. Trump and those that voted for Joseph R. Biden Jr. is widening, according to a new survey released by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

&gt;Missouri has a vaccination rate of 40 percent, well below the national rate of 48 percent. Many counties have vaccination rates in the teens and 20s.

&gt;The number of Missourians seeking the vaccine has dwindled. Nearly 50,000 were getting vaccinated each day in mid-April; on Thursday, it was 7,000.

&gt;The drop-off in vaccinations is true across the country. As of Friday, providers were administering about 590,000 doses per day on average, a decrease of about 82 percent from the peak of 3.38 million reported on April 13.

&gt;Hospitalizations are rare among the fully vaccinated. Dr. Mohart said that 95 percent of the 128 Covid patients at Mercy Springfield on Friday had not been immunized and tests show that most cases were of the Delta variant.

&gt;It was a similar picture at Cox Medical Center South in Springfield, which admitted 19 new patients for Covid-19 treatment on Thursday. From June 1 through July 8, there were 29 coronavirus deaths there.

&gt;”The staff is exhausted and overwhelmed,” said Ashley Casad, vice president of clinical services for CoxHealth, which has six hospitals in southwest Missouri and northwest Arkansas. “This is going to go on for a month. The light at the end of the tunnel seems incredibly far away.”

 &gt;She said the rise in cases seemed to be caused by three factors: the area’s low vaccination rate, the arrival of the Delta variant and Springfield’s recent decision to lift its mask mandate. Ninety percent of Covid patients at Cox Medical Center South in Springfield have the Delta variant, and they are trending younger, she said.

&gt;Ms. Casad said the hospital was sending patients to other medical centers because it lacked enough staff members to care for them, though the supply of respirators was adequate.

&gt;A state health official said on Friday that 500 ventilators were stockpiled in the capital, Jefferson City, and were available to be sent out to hospitals, but that so far there had been no requests for them.

&gt;The rise of new cases in southwest Missouri prompted Springfield public schools to mandate masks for the summer session, and Mercy health system said that it would require its staff members to be immunized by Sept. 30.

Check out this 
[great article about how unlikely it is for ""long term"" side effects from the vaccines to show up a few months or years later.](https://www.chop.edu/news/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine)

The J&amp;J vaccine manufacturing mixup that you heard about [isn't a problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/mhhf8x/johnson_johnson_statement_on_us_covid19_vaccine/) There are no tainted or flawed doses from J&amp;J being distributed, all our doses of J&amp;J came from a different manufacturer in the Netherlands and are both safe and effective.

Vaccines given EUA are safe even if you hear about [clotting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mh39g4/blood_clots_and_the_az_vaccine_revisited/) or [growing a third arm.](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/12/04/get-ready-for-false-side-effects)

That the vaccine manufacturers are not liable (you can't sue them, etc.) if you die from their Covid vaccine is a [logical error], that's [true of all vaccines, and really, most medical practices/drugs/etc.]  They just have to warn you about potential risks, [which they actually do a good job of, even though those risks are miniscule.]  Note that this would also be the case (you can't sue them if it hurts you) for any future ""cures"", therapeutics, or other treatments for the disease. 

The vaccine isn't killing anyone. You heard wrong.  Great discussion [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/oc45h0/scientists_quit_journal_board_protesting_grossly/) 

Clotting is so rare from the vaccine and so common from the virus, it's basically not worth talking about.

Should we be excited about a vaccine [that's not 90%+ effective?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lv3h8e/daily_discussion_thread_march_01_2021/gpbwgkf/) Excellent question!

It's too soon to say ""lifelong"" but [that is a possibility.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4nkco/the_immune_system_mounts_a_lasting_defense_after/) Also, it looks like those who have recovered *may* only need [one dose of an mRNA vaccine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/labst4/robust_spike_antibody_responses_and_increased/). There are some people (~7%) who don't develop lasting immunity from infections, but it's not clear to me now whether vaccines would develop lasting immunity for these people. 

Immunity from the vaccine [lasts *at least 6 months*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l9nfu8/stable_neutralizing_antibody_levels_six_months/) probably a lot,[ lot longer,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6a6pq/durability_of_responses_after_sarscov2_mrna1273/)  probably many years.

Vaccine induced immunity may be [comparable to](https://www.verywellhealth.com/antibodies-from-vaccines-and-from-natural-infection-5092564), or [better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l5whhu/increased_resistance_of_sarscov2_variants_b1351/), or a [LOT better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m8m23c/neutralizing_antibodies_against_sarscov2_variants/), immunity from a previous infection. Especially to [Alpha/Beta.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgxpre/vaccineinduced_immunity_provides_more_robust/) Natual immunity from clearing an infection is highly protective of future infections, but you have to risk the disease in order to get it.

Vaccination and previous infection [reduce viral load, which reduces spread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s). Updated info [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ocygyp/vast_majority_of_breakthrough_infections_in/)

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) article does a good job of explaining the likelihood of vaccines *at least* reducing spread.  [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lf744r/daily_discussion_thread_february_08_2021/gml0gyi/) may help too. Data from [Scotland looks great](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m3tx1n/covid19_vaccine_linked_to_a_reduction_in/).

 This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a great reduction in ability to spread the virus. [Maybe even with just one dose!](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242) You should [get both doses though.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m2mtnv/immune_response_to_sarscov2_variants_of_concern/)

Reinfections are rare, some studies show [less than 1 in 1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kyj0bx/sarscov2_reinfection_in_a_cohort_of_43000/) (maybe in the 1 in 10,000 range, you'll have to read the study, it's awesome).  Reinfections tend to be much milder than previous infections, even those new variants. Check the [comments here](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lm0mc2/prior_covid19_significantly_reduces_the_risk_of/) for some really interesting discussion regarding reinfection.

[Delayed second doses are fine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/layx6g/single_dose_administration_and_the_influence_of/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) At least with [ChAdOx1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), though there is evidence from the mRNA vaccine trials that suggest that up to 6 weeks is better if not at least acceptable. The problem is that you have to wait longer for the second dose, and therefore, full protection. [CDC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lbiqne/daily_discussion_thread_february_03_2021/glvp1nl?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) used to say that there is no maximum interval between doses, but has recently changed. [Pfizer says not more than 6 weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/liakcb/covid19_vaccine_doses_shouldnt_be_more_than_six/). 

[Dose intervals might increase efficacy if extended past 3 or 4 weeks,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/mudvjd/questin_about_vaccine_intervals/gv58byt/) CDC says you have up to 42 days between doses (but that may be extended at some point).

Did you accidentally get mixed doses? [All good.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html)

Even if your antibodies fade over time, [you still have immunity.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/npeymo/sarscov2specific_memory_b_cells_can_persist_in/)

It's getting the vaccine, possibly boosters, for a MUCH better chance at fighting the virus **versus** relying on your own immune system to withstand COVID and its variants.

I see we're resorting to very low quality insults to instill our authority. Good strategy. 

&gt;If our leadership tells us boosters aren't necessary now, when is it necessary?

When further research is complete and shows definitively the timeframe in which the vaccine's protection fades to a level which justifies a booster to the original vaccine... as stated repeatedly and publicly both by the people you're claiming are trying to kill us all off and by basic, proven science. No opinions necessary for my answer to your question. 

&gt;Once a variant completely evades a vaccine and we are unprotected?

A booster to our current vaccines would not necessarily help with a variant that isn't combated by our current vaccines. So a booster wouldn't necessarily be relevant unless it were a tweaked booster - one which would be tweaked to combat that variant which doesn't currently exist since we're theorizing it in this comment thread, so they can't really have a new vaccine to block it yet. In which case ""when it is necessary"" would become ""when it exists"", which isn't yet.

&gt;This is a reaction to irresponsibility on the part of Fauci and the CDC for being reactionary.  

It's an intriguing take that i'm kinda baffled by, but i'm not sure what your goal is here and i'm not going to guess at it. If it's political then you do violate rule 4, since you randomly brought up not violating subreddit rules in the next part. Not suspicious at all.

&gt;Is that a conspiracy theory? No, it's an opinion on the source material, which by expressing one doesn't violate the rules of the subreddit, does it. Understand now?

It's an opinion that you're justifying with a complete omission of publicly stated facts and insertion of a conspiracy theory (call them opinions if it tickles your fancy) that the governing bodies are intentionally mishandling their virus response.

Food, on the other hand, with no known confirmed cases when people were searching for a long time, suggests that it's not a thing at all, though it is still theoretically possible.

Yes, those are the numbers. But no, that is probably not the correct incidence rate. When you have numbers like these, they will almost always be at least somewhat under reported.

Should they have come out as publicly as they have?  Probably not. At least not without a heads up of the findings to the CDC/FDA so they can make a joint statement.

However, Pfizer has the right as a company to say whatever they want about their product.  They could easily stop providing vaccine until the third dose is approved.  

The absolutely last thing Pfizer wants is to be blamed for a COVID death because their vaccine didn’t work.  That’s what’s driving their actions here.

Keep in mind if people die because of side effects the emergency approval largely protects them.  So it’s really a win win for Pfizer no matter what happens, so long as you don’t die from COVID after they claim you (a reasonably healthy random sample from the population) are protected by their vaccine.

My main point is that people hear “third shot” and immediately jump to “need it now” when Pfizer is merely preparing the public for a future third shot.

I could have gone to the ER I suppose, but there's a long explanation I'd have to give as to why I didn't.

I got better and back to my normal functioning after maybe a week and a half. But then I started having a palpitation I've never had before where I can see my heartbeat in my abdomen. I'm reluctant to go to my doctor because of how dismissive my experiences have been in healthcare. My pulse is very elevated again and I had to increase the bisoprolol again.

The first problem is the subtext, which is that Americans who’ve been vaccinated for 6+ months probably need a booster soon. That is not Pfizer’s call to make, though they strongly implied it to be the case. That’s the government’s call, to be made using a variety of data points, not just Pfizer’s data. Pfizer needs to prove through trials that its particular boosters are safe and effective if/when we need that booster, but their job is not to be the arbiter of deciding when (if ever) Americans need to get their extra doses — that’s a public health decision, to be made by public health agencies. 

The second problem is Pfizer muddied the waters at a time when many Americans lack trust or clarity about the vaccines. The government has long been saying that we don’t need boosters any time soon. Pfizer then puts out a statement suggesting otherwise. And it just confuses the hell out of people in an environment when millions of Americans are already hesitant.

Unfortunately, several countries find themselves with an insufficient number of shots to fully vaccinate their citizens; given that most vaccines require two doses. It is also being suggested that nasal vaccines may help prevent viral entry in the body (and infecting the lungs). Getting two birds with one stone, researchers have reported that a single-dose intranasal COVID-19 vaccine provides full protection against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

  
According to the multi-institutional study, a single dose of a parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5)–based intranasal vaccine provided full protection against COVID-19 in animal models. It was found that the vaccine was able to block animal-to-animal transmission of the novel coronavirus. The study was published in the journal Science Advances.

  
""We have been developing this vaccine platform for more than 20 years, and we began working on new vaccine formulations to combat COVID-19 during the early days of the pandemic.

We already know that in the case of asymptomatic patients or people with mild forms of the disease, the proportion of those who either did not develop antibodies at all due to contact with the virus or developed a low antibody titer is higher compared to those who had severe forms. of disease. Therefore, there is a variability of the immune response to viral infection, especially to new strains, such as the Delta strain, which is gaining momentum in our country and will most likely become dominant in the next period. Therefore, at this time, vaccination is the only way to protect ourselves from this virus, and if we do not increase the rate of vaccination,, said Dumitru Jardan, a biologist in the research division of the MedLife Group.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
Proof that vaccination works is the Capital itself, which seems to have one of the highest immunization rates. The analyzed data show that almost 70% of all Bucharest residents gained natural immunity or by vaccination with COVID-19, this being correlated with the high vaccination rate registered in Bucharest.  


  
""We are still processing the study data, and we will return to the beginning of next week with new information regarding the evolution of the pandemic. We still have a lot of data that needs to be rigorously analyzed. For example, preliminary results show that only 30% of those who went through a severe form of the disease decided to get vaccinated. Another piece of information is related to the fact that the counties that tested and reported very few cases of the disease, in reality had many people who went through the disease, most likely without knowing it. In addition, depending on the sociological profile of the researched audience, age, sex &amp; geographical area, we will be able to submit concrete measures to the authorities to increase the vaccination rate, targeted "" , added Mihai Marcu.  


  
MedLife, the only private medical company that has invested significant funds in research and managed to monitor the pandemic with significant contribution to society  


  
As a leader in private medicine, MedLife has been concerned with public health and has been actively involved in pandemic monitoring, conducting extensive studies with Romanian doctors, biologists and researchers. Thus, in April 2020, the first and largest study in Central and Eastern Europe on the degree of natural immunization of the population at COVID-19 started, which showed that, at that time, collective immunity in Romania was very low, below 2%. During the following months of the pandemic, the medical service provider MedLife carried out no less than 9 studies, all with its own resources and without any help from public institutions, constantly returning with new information about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 strains in Romania , the dynamics of antibodies acquired as a result of infection or vaccination, as well as about the intention to vaccinate Romanians. MedLife's investment in research amounts to more than two million euros since the beginning of the pandemic.  


  
""Since the first months of the pandemic, we have focused our efforts and resources to monitor the epidemiological situation, providing the authorities with relevant information about the evolution of the pandemic. Thus, as the largest private medicine company in Romania and the only one with national coverage, listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange, MedLife has proven that it can have a significant contribution in informing the population and the Romanian authorities. It should be noted that until this stage we did not have concrete support from the authorities for the steps taken. Their reluctance to work with the private sector is difficult to understand, especially if we look at Western countries, where there is a good collaboration between state and private, where states are proud of the achievements of private medical or pharmaceutical companies. However,  


  
In fact, we are currently working on the first study in the region that evaluates the cellular immune response against COVID-19. We will soon return with crucial information for the evolution of the pandemic regarding the resistance of those who went through the disease to a new reinfection. In addition, we will assess the potential for illness and hospitalization, including the risk of death for people who have gone through the disease and have not been vaccinated. For now, it is only clear that Romania will become a case study for the Delta strain, with a relatively small number of vaccinated people, half of the European average, and a very large number of people who have gone through the disease "", concluded Mihai Mark, President and CEO of MedLife Group  
\*\*\*

  
The MedLife Medical System is the only operator truly concerned with public health since the beginning of the pandemic, conducting no less than 9 studies exclusively with its own funds and resources, with Romanian doctors and researchers. Thus, the company provided the authorities with imported information on the natural immunization of the population, at national level and in specific outbreaks, the dynamic evolution of antibodies against COVID-19, the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus circulating in Romania, and how by the transmission or presence of other strains.  


  
MedLife's investment in research amounts to more than two million euros since the beginning of the pandemic. The research program is carried out exclusively from the company's own funds.

&amp;#x200B;

  
MedLife doctors show that if the rural environment were taken into account, the number of those who either went through the disease or were vaccinated could reach 10-12 million people.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  
Less than 10% of those who have gone through the disease but have not been vaccinated have a neutralizing antibody titer.

&amp;#x200B;

  
Romania can become the most important nursery in Europe for investment and tourism. This is, however, conditioned by the rapid increase in the vaccination rate.  
Based on the information from this study, MedLife will submit concrete measures to the authorities next week to increase the vaccination rate, targeted, but also surprising information on the evolution of the pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

  
Actively involved in research activities since the beginning of the pandemic, MedLife Medical System has conducted a new study, through its own research division, to assess the degree of immunization acquired naturally or following vaccination in Romania, at the urban level. The research was carried out on a representative sample of 943 people, residents in cities with different characteristics in terms of vaccination rate and infection rate: Bucharest, Cluj, Constanta, Timisoara - area 1, respectively Giurgiu, Suceava and Piatra Neamt - area 2.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
In order to determine the antibody titer against COVID-19, anti-Spike RBD (protein fragment) IgG serological tests were performed on Abbott analytical systems, quantitatively measuring the level of antibodies and anti-Nucleocapsitis IgG (qualitatively) confirming or refuting the presence of antibodies.

&amp;#x200B;

  
“We make public the results of a new research approach carried out entirely from our own resources and exclusively with MedLife doctors and specialists. The data show that the level of collective immunity only at the urban level is over 60%, respectively 6-7 million people, which indicates a major evolution of the immunization rate, given that in May last year we, MedLife, we announce, for the first time, that the immunity of the Romanian population to COVID-19 is below 2%. Moreover, if we extrapolate the data and take into account the rural environment, we are probably talking about 10-12 million Romanians who went through the disease or were vaccinated. However, this is not the time to relax. Studies on the Delta strain show unequivocally that natural immunity, which is obtained by passing through the disease, it is not effective in front of the new Delta strain. Wave 4 is closer than originally thought, probably in a month at most we will have, again, thousands of cases a day because of this much more infectious strain.

&amp;#x200B;

  
There is only one solution: vaccination. If the high level of natural immunization had been accompanied by an equally high rate of immunity through vaccination, Romania would probably have done very well in Europe. The vaccination campaign has proved to be excellently organized, in particular with a very good territorial coverage and availability of vaccine stocks, but there is a need for an even greater increase in terms of communication, ie the collective involvement of all institutions, of the political class, business people, media, artists, civil society to inform the population about the importance of this phenomenon and to increase, in the shortest possible time, the vaccination rate. If we prioritize vaccination in the next period,, said Mihai Marcu, President and CEO of MedLife Group.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
Three times more people in urban areas have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus compared to official reports. The figures are growing alarmingly in medium and small urban areas  


&amp;#x200B;

  
The study by MedLife specialists shows that three times more people in large urban areas have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, compared to official reports that reflect only the universe of individuals who have gone through the disease and taken the PCR test. in order to confirm the diagnosis. Thus, according to the serological tests performed during the approach carried out by MedLife, 34% of the population investigated in the big cities has been exposed to COVID-19 infection since the onset of the pandemic and until now. Of these, more than half were most likely asymptomatic. Moreover, the same study shows that 50% of the population of small urban areas went through the disease, up to nine times more than official reports.

&amp;#x200B;

  
However, the situation remains worrying in Romania, given that people who have gone through the disease and have not been vaccinated have a very good chance of being re-infected with the new strains of coronavirus now in circulation. Also, unlike Western European countries, the population over the age of 60, the most exposed to severe disease, including hospitalization and even death, has chosen to be vaccinated to a much lesser extent.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
Despite the rate of collective immunity, we are still far from the end of the pandemic. Less than 10% of those who have been vaccinated but have not been vaccinated have a significant antibody titer

&amp;#x200B;

  
Although data on the rate of collective immunization are optimistic, the MedLife research team warns that the 4th wave of the pandemic is inevitable and that its effects on the health system and the economy will be devastating if the vaccination rate does not increase rapidly in the next period.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
This is explained by the fact that less than 10% of those who came in contact with the virus, but were not vaccinated, have a neutralizing antibody titer. In contrast, MedLife physicians point out that the cumulative effect of vaccination and a history of COVID-19 is very strong, with 84% of those who also went through the disease and were vaccinated having a neutralizing antibody titer, including against the Delta strain.",,,1625972430,{},h4rqfuq,True,t3_ohwjdm,False,True,t3_ohwjdm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ohwjdm/medlife_study_the_degree_of_collective_immunity/h4rqfuq/,1626155361,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I'm not so sure about this. From what I understand, clinical myocarditis symptoms are quite extreme, and would usually lead to further investigations by a doctor.

For example, I had milder symptoms than myocarditis typically presents about a month ago (heart palpitations and slight shortness of breath) and went to the ER after a tele nurse instructed me to. Since it was two cardiac symptoms paired together, I was admitted, given an EKG almost immediately, later got blood taken, a chest x-ray and the ER doctor checked my heart. He even had me stay an hour after all the tests were done just to observe. All my tests came back fine (I've chalked it up to anxiety).

They also said that it was ok to take off the masks (inside, we never had to wear them outside) if people could stay 1.5 meters away from each other.

At that time, they expected infections to continue to fall, although they noted some uncertainty on the mid- to long-term.

On the [2nd of July](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/brieven/2021/07/05/advies-aan-vws-na-omt-118) (!!) they did still not see this coming. They noted the same uncertainty, but added that the drop in hospitalizations 'might stagnate' in July/August due to delta.

The only thing I see about behavior in this latest report is research about the willingness of teenagers to be vaccinated, which would help stop the spread.

The rest of the report is mostly about hypothetical situations. 

In both these latest reports (the last urgent report is not published yet), they do say that we should stay vigilant and when new outbreaks come up, the government should take appropriate measures. 

Main problem - in many people's view - with the OMT advice has been that the government was kinda pushing them to be more lenient, due to pressures to open up the economy. In some cases, the way the government communicated about the advice has been wrong (""sure, you can go to the club from the day you receive your Janssen vaccine""). In some cases, they stretched some measures (40 hours between test and event instead of the recommended 24). 

I'm following some scientists on twitter who already predicted at the end of May (!!) that we would could have a hard spike due to delta, i.e. when restrictions were still a lot stronger. These scientists were mostly right the previous waves (at least more right than the government/OMT). It seems like OMT is near-sighted and attributes some weird exclusive status to the Dutch, as if what happened in the UK with delta would never happen here. 

I think there's a good chance the people that are part of OMT have been working so hard for a year and a half that they haven't had the chance to see how real people behaved in the cities here and in public transport. [Members](https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19/omt) are mostly doctors, virologists, infectiologist, micro-biologists. There are 2 epidemiologists as far as I can see, but no field epidemiologists who have experience working in countries with epidemics, and knowing how people respond to measures by their government. 

This has turned into a bit of a rant, as I'm very frustrated by how our government has handled the pandemic, and how many of my fellow citizens here seem to have no grasp of the concept of exponential growth. There were so many smart people, who are really in touch with the data, the same data that RIVM and OMT have, who were horrified by the thought of opening up 2 weeks ago, so many people who saw this coming. And the cabinet just says: ""we did NOT see this coming"".",,,1625990330,{},h4serec,False,t3_ohkfqu,False,False,t1_h4rlxdo,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ohkfqu/netherlands_reports_10345_new_coronavirus_cases/h4serec/,1626167747,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Citing the study by the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and Ministry of Health (MOH), he said the data also showed that the vaccine's protection against symptomatic disease is “between 80 and 90 per cent”.

I'm afraid you're not understanding how statistics work and what 95% efficiency means. When multiplying probabilities together, you compare the prior probability with the observed (actual) probability in order to determine what effect the change in probability makes. 

You will not understand what these people are telling you and why your gut feeling is wrong until you spend some time on a maths class on how probabilities work. I would recommend the following: [Khan Academy: Compound probability of independent events.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/x9e81a4f98389efdf:prob-comb/x9e81a4f98389efdf:compound-probability-of-ind-events-using-mult-rule/v/compound-probability-of-independent-events)

I do not mean to be condescending, however this is not something that can be understood without learning the maths underpinning it.

The responsibility is on the company, this is the same for checking ID for under 18. Then there are a couple of nightclubs who fucked up and didn't check ID's and they ruined it for the rest of us. 

""A couple of nightclubs"" don't account for 10k+ daily cases.

Yes you are missing something, .1% of people getting infected that have the vaccine does not equal 99.9% efficacy. It would only mean that if the virus infected 100% of people that did not have the vaccine. That's why trials are set up with control groups, so that they can gauge the actual effectiveness of the vaccine.

For example the Pfizer study had around 30k people in it I believe. Of those 30k I think it was split 15k, 15k in terms of those that got the vaccine and those that got the placebo (I'm not too concerned of if I have the right trial size this is just an example). Of the 15k that got Pfizer just 8 of them were infected. Now, by your logic that would mean that just .053% of people got infected this would mean Pfizer has an efficacy of 99.947% right? Well then why did they announce the vaccine to be just 95% effective? Because not everyone in the control group got infected. In the control group there were 162 cases. So the vaccine prevented 154 cases, thus 154/162 is 95.06% efficacy. 

Before you ask you cannot say that Sinovac is roughly similar to Pfizer because your 99.909% is quite close to 99.947% which is quoted in my figures because the efficacy is dependent on local infection rates at the time etc.

Link to the Pfizer press release where I got the efficacy data from. Note that this is obviously vs the original strain but it was just an example to explain efficacy and why your assertion is incorrect. Obviously I don't know what the efficacy of Sinovac is without seeing a control group to compare it to: https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine",,,1626000067,{},h4sok8f,False,t3_oi00ag,False,False,t1_h4sn3qu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oi00ag/thai_rush_to_buy_moderna_vaccine_over_fears_of/h4sok8f/,1626172912,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Should we be worried about this as long as it doesn’t translate into hospitalizations? Some think ‘no’ other think ‘yes’. The latter group is worried about long covid, which happens to a lot of ‘mild cases’ as well. And also, not all ‘mild cases’ are very mild. There is a large grey area between having the sniffles for a couple of days and basically lying on your deathbed because of covid19. Some people, including younger people, were never hospitalized but cannot get out of bed for weeks. I personally don’t think that’s ‘mild’.

Also, I’m not fully vaccinated yet, and I’m pregnant. I consider myself a ‘vulnerable’ case too given that covid19 is associated with pregnancy- and birth complications. Which the government acknowledges, but pregnant women don’t get priority here.

The clever bar owners realised that ignoring that NPHET advice was a mistake and that there would be an explosion in cases and Indoor Dining would be almost immediately closed again. So the Clever Bar owners never re-opened because they knew it would be shortlived, knew their employees coming off and going back onto the PUP (Pandemic Unemployment Payment) would be a PITA for both the employee and them (in terms of tax accounting for them), knew that all that stock bought in would cost a fortune, end up not being needed, end up going out of date during the inevitable re-lockdown if they couldn't do a deal with the breweries to cover such an eventuality.

I don't understand why people think this could be the end of the Pub industry in Ireland for example. They are getting supports from the government to keep them afloat. This is viable because the government can borrow as many billions as they need from the ECB. Everyone is in the same boat in Europe. Its not like the EU is going to punish any given EU country for exceeding normal mandated Budget deficit levels or charge us punitive interest rates. Its a once in a hundred year event thats affecting the whole of Europe nevermind the world. The ECB and the World Bank understand why everyones national Debt just ballooned by Billions. The new levels will be the new normal. They punish a country compared to another when they go and blow 20 billion on new fighter jets for no reason instead of say infrastructure with a ROI.

There’s still a lot of uncertainty there, but the picture seems to become more and more worrisome over time.

Many people seem to care only about the death rate, are dismissive about other considerations like Long Covid, and have an unjustified confidence that a vaccinated person needn’t worry about Long Covid. They’ve already made up their mind that “Covid is over”, and won’t accept any idea or information that goes against that conclusion.

With regard to Long Covid, as you point out there doesn’t seem to be much of a relationship between the severity of the initial illness, and the likelihood of developing Long Covid issues, and the severity of such issues.

It really does suck, but taking sensible precautions can prevent things from getting back to the troubling lock down state we were in. I think it's very possible to wear a mask when indoors in groups and/or choosing smaller group settings, to be mindful of keeping some distance, keeping our hands clean, and having spaces well ventilated.

But to clarify, when I say I don’t like it I don’t mean it offends me, I just mean I don’t like using it.  It’s also weird to me that a mistake that was realized relatively quickly didn’t get corrected right away, they just kind of kept calling us Indians lol. Having said that, it’s been the primary term used in America for so many years that it is ingrained in a lot of us the same way it is ingrained in a lot of non Natives. Many of my tribal documents still use it, a good amount of my family members will use it without thinking twice. So it doesn’t really bother me if someone refers to me as Indian. 

I don’t think it’s exclusively an age thing, I know younger folks that still say it when referring to themselves. However, its use is definitely declining, at least from what I have observed, so I would agree that the older generations use it more than the younger ones. Obviously I can’t speak for other tribes or even my tribe since we are all individuals with our own preferences, but my personal experience is we are all over the map with what we like to be called. I use Native American, personally. And to me “indigenous” is an encyclopedia word to use for animals or plants, it’s kind of funny to me how that has been gaining steam as the preferred PC word used to refer to us. I personally have never heard a tribal citizen  say “I’m indigenous” lol. Some like just plain old “Native”. My dad, uncles, grandpa, and great grandpa all used “Indian”. I do think the word will just wind up phasing itself out eventually, but it will take a while. In the meantime, I don’t think it bothers most of us as much as people think it does.

So when the covid shot was labeled a ""vaccine"" that puts thoughts of long term protection on people's minds, whether or not there may have been talks of boosters. Now these people are already hearing of needing a third shot when they just got their first 2 rounds a few months ago.

However, there are some definite concerns and limitations around the results that I think mandate further study before anyone can say ""yea"" or ""nay"".

First of all, the ""study"" was meta-analysis of multiple lower-quality studies - limited data, low cell count, not double-blinded, etc.  Nothing was peer-reviewed.  The study was affiliated with the BIRD Group (British Ivermectin Recommendation Development Group), clearly not an unbiased organization, and the researchers didn't disclosed this fact in the study - which is a huge red flag for me.  Lastly, there's no mention of whether or not the people taking different drugs were also taking steroids or not, which have been shown to have a clear benefit.

So when I said to one that I'd like to see a proper study done that is actually using gold standard methodology and then I'd enjoy reviewing the outcomes (and hope they show good results) I got accused of being difficult and purposely just trying to piss him off.  

Mind you, this person is extremely busily reading every ingredient of all the US approved vaccines and is also challenging the results and the safety saying that ""the vaccines are killing tens of thousands people"" and has a huge amount of skepticism in general about the danger the vaccines bring.  Yet he's ready to put a drug in his system without knowing if it works.  Of course, he was ready to start taking hydroxychloroquine as soon as Dr.  Donald J. Trump, MD, PhD, got on that bandwagon.

FOR FUCKS SAKE - I want this fucking pandemic to be over as much as anyone.  I don't give a single flying fuck if the pandemic is ended by weed, chocolate, benadryl, popcorn **or** ivermectin.  If there's a cheap, safe and effective treatment that prevents COVID, let's have it and us it.  However, I am not going to just inject random shit into my body without some good science behind it.  ADDITIONALLY, I would want to know if the drug would actually provide similar protection against infection, hospitalization and death as a vaccine, or less so that I could know how protected I'd be.   Is ivermectin as good as a vaccine in preventing hospitalization/death?  What is the right timeframe to take it?  If I take it at a higher dosage than what is given for parasitic infections, what side effects are there?  Is it effective against just the base type of COVID or against the variants?  

It's just amazing that people will accept these drugs at face value with very limited or poorly-done research, but won't accept the vaccines that have been given out to billions of people now worldwide.

Like I said, I hope this fucking works - but let's be sure about it by conducting a real, double blinded, peer-reviewed study with sufficient scale to make a statistically valid conclusion.

You say that Pfizer strongly implied that the rollout of the booster shot was their decision to make. I don't get how this is them just assuming that we need a third shot when they're literally asking the gov't if we need a third shot. Even if the U.S. said no thanks, we don't want to authorize, there are plenty of other countries that may be interested (EU, UK, etc) and Pfizer could apply there. The U.S. still hasn't approved AstraZeneca, but they've still sold lots of doses other places, so it's not like this would be unprecedented.

I guess from a PR perspective, it could have been handled better, but what is the alternative, just have the FDA and Pfizer put out a statement together? Doesn't that have problematic issues where they seem to be just too closely tied, and people think that the gov't is just going to end up rubber stamping the product of a private pharma company and not do any due diligence? A significant number of those that haven't gotten the vaccine are still concerned about the EUA and how quickly it was approved. If FDA and Pfizer do everything behind closed doors and just announce things publicly together when it's all smoothed over, aren't people going to be suspicious that there's no real back and forth and FDA just approves whatever Pfizer does? 

Pfizer have developed their candidate third vaccine dose. They need approval from the U.S. to event start their trials, which will last months in themselves, not including the analyzing of data, mass production of those doses, etc. 

One option would be to wait until FDA/CDC officially agree that we need a third shot for ""clear public messaging,"" but then we'd need to wait for months before those shots got into arms. 

Another option to avoid this issue with announcing before we need the doses to avoid muddying the waters could be that they secretly asked for the approval to start the trial, and then a few months later FDA and Pfizer released a joint statement, well, trials are completed now and that third dose is coming now, just when it's needed. Wouldn't that be lacking a lot of transparency in terms of when the trials were started and approved? For a public company is this even allowed? 

I don't see either of these options being good, and I still see issues with just a joint statement, where it seems like FDA is just going to rubber stamp anything Pfizer does. Or just a lack of transparency in the process where we're just seeing the end stages when everything is already agreed upon already. 

Honestly, this seems like a completely ludicrous situation where not only does Pfizer need to ask for permission from the FDA, but now they also need to make sure they ask for permission to even ask for permission. Pfizer made a statement that they're going to ask for permission to start a trial for their third dose, which they've made. FDA said, we'll look into it, but right now we don't need that third dose. As an outsider, I see this as a completely reasonable situation.

Our federal government has literally done fucking -nothing- outside of salary relief that ended in sept/Nov last year.

Thankfully our state premier is a fucking legend.

At the first sign that hotel quarantine (returning aussies must quarantine for 2 weeks in a hotel, with or without a positive case. Sometimes positive cases have shared to security, etc) has failed, we lockdown for 3-4 days, wait for a few zeros. Crack out the masks for another week, then go back to being 100% normal.

Melbourne at one point had 170 new cases a day. A 112 day lockdown had them at zero.

So far we know the following:

Other issues include cognitive problems, difficulty concentrating, depression, muscle pain, headache, rapid heartbeat and intermittent fever.](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-long-haulers-long-term-effects-of-covid19)

I'm a tour guide that after almost 2 years FINALLY got back on the job. Got my 1st Pfizer shot yesterday only as in my country they've been vaccinating by age.

My tourists are from the US and fully vaccinated since January. We ride a car for 7+1 pax, they're 4 and I sit in the front with the driver. He still didn't get his chance to be vaccinated too. We have to drive with closed windows and a full AC so we can talk to each other.

Our tourists have argumented that since they're vaccinated they don't need to wear masks close to us because they won't transmit covid. Many tourists around the streets ignore the rule of the country that states that ""you'll pay a fine of 500€ if you don't wear a mask"". Because of that they also argue that no one follows the rules or gets fined so they don't have to worry.

After spending around 6 hours in the car with them I'm a bit apprehensive tbh. 1 of them even coughed occasionally. I don't know how to argue with them with all of this to save my arse or getting me fired...

First you call someone out for blindly following the CDC when they hadn't even mentioned the CDC. Now your mentioning that ""everyone"" here doesn't want to hear bad news. Where is all this coming from?

I don't like putting my head in the sand, it's coarse and it gets everywhere, so I stay away from it. The delta variant is much more contagious and is infecting more people both vaccinated and not. No ones ignoring that, but of course we're going to dismiss social media as a primary source of information, it has been notoriously ripe with disinformation. 

You're also proving why anecdotal information is not useful evidence to extrapolate onto large groups. Anecdotes are useful and important, but they are only one set of data in a certain set of conditions. How do you know your friend's social media posts run contrary to the data collected by independent scientists all over the world? Lets say you see a bunch of Facebook posts of vaccinated people that have been infected with COVID-19 and let's presume they are all accurate. 

How do you determine percentages from that? How many other vaccinated people were also exposed and didn't get infected? What were the circumstances that they got infected in? Is this happening everywhere or just in a small area and if so why? Outbreaks happen in vaccinated areas still. If there is a high viral load being passed around in an inclosed space then that 95% protection (slightly less with delta) with mRNA vaccines is going to be put to the test frequently resulting in more infections even if folks are vaccinated. 

Beyond all that even if you get infected when you are vaccinated you are generally asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. There is still a chance of severe infection, but it is very low. So what is my head in the sand about here, is there something I'm missing other than your friend's social media posts?",,,1626025963,{},h4tvmpd,False,t3_ohzq1l,False,False,t1_h4tqlq0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ohzq1l/daily_discussion_thread_july_11_2021/h4tvmpd/,1626197548,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Actually, coronaviruses in general are highly stable and boasts a higher degree of replication fidelity compared to other viruses like rhinoviruses, which are responsible for the annual flu.  This is because coronaviruses have a self-proofreading mechanism that goes back to correct most errors made in the replication process.

We can see this in the fact that despite being in circulation now for over 1.5 years, the original wild type is still 97% identical to the delta variant, and early immunity from the originally infected continues to be robust today, even against newer variants like delta.  The early infected were studied mid pandemic and are likely still closely monitored today for continuing immunity and I have seen no reports of them losing immunity en masse.

The precursor to this virus, and it’s closest cousin that we know of, SARS 1, induced natural immunity to those infected with it, and these survivors were found to have immunity still to date some 20 years later, and they were even found to have cross immunity to this newer strain of SARS. SARS 1 is also a coronavirus, of course, and the closest cousin to this current strain.

Okay, you bring up a good point that I thought was implied but perhaps I should have made explicit.  There is no way to _disprove_ any transmission method.  For example, see [my other comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ohdwot/daily_discussion_thread_july_10_2021/h4r5ftm/) - the fact that there have been no confirmed cases of food-borne transmission does not mean it cannot happen.

However, when there is intense epidemiological attention on a rampant pandemic, after some time passes, not having been able to confirm any cases of a particular form of transmission is very significant.  It doesn't tell you that it can't happen, but it is very strong evidence that form of transmission is not a significant component of the spread of this virus.  We can, for instance, conclude that you don't need to worry about food borne transmission, even though it's theoretically possible, because if it were *likely*, chances are very very very high that some cases would have been identified by now.

So I'm not asking ""is it possible"", nor am I asking whether we can disprove something.  In fact, I assume it **is** possible to catch covid through brief casual contact outdoors.  What I am asking is exactly what I asked in that comment, no more no less: Have any such cases been identified in the real world yet?

Briefly:

- Digital signature checks might often be skipped because people don't know what they're doing and scanning takes time. Proper-looking paper certificates and app screenshots can be easily forged.
  - The German Corona-Warn contact tracing app, which can also be used as a wallet app for test and vaccination certs, doesn't check the signature in QR codes at all. It will happily scan and display a forged QR code with invalid signature. The official appearance might further convince to skip digital verification. Also, this might be used to defraud some buyers of forged certs, because they believe a cert that is accepted by the official app is valid. This does not work in the (also official German) CovPass or other countries' wallet apps.
- Certs can be issued by doctors and pharmacies. They could be corrupt, their credentials (no two-factor authentication) to the cert issuance system could be stolen, or they could be persuaded to issue a cert by presenting an easily forged yellow vaccination book with a forged entry.
  - Certs don't contain specific issuer details (e.g. all German certs are issued in the name of the national institute RKI) or vaccine batch codes, making it impossible to revoke certificates issued by a specific, known compromised facility.",,,1625957834,{},h4r0mnz,False,t3_ogotel,False,True,t1_h4nc5i3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ogotel/fake_covid_vaccine_certificates_sold_on_dark_web/h4r0mnz/,1626141532,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

There are only 4 variants of concern. There are 187m confirmed cases worldwide. That's one variant of concern per 46 million confirmed cases. The coronavirus is not that mutagenic. Mutations and selection work on sites and probability. There are only so many sites in the virus genome where a mutation yields a viable virus, only so many ways to fold the proteins. Presumably the viable mutations most likely to occur already have occurred. Typically a variant of concern is made up of several mutations, and doesn't totally break through mRNA protection because the mutations are still attached to the rest of the virus that has proteins your vaccinated immune system can recognize.

When then mRNA vaccines were beginning development and their target proteins fixed we didn't know as much about the ways the variants would be concerns. They didn't have the fingerprints of those proteins like they do now. So now they could come up with an mRNA vaccine that includes all the known fingerprints of concern, which are the most likely to emerge, and that should be the end of it. As time goes on and more and more people are vaccinated they have the number of all these bugs and even viable mutations that come less and less frequently are still blocked because they're attached to all these other proteins in your immune system's threat database.

&gt;Covid distancing may have weakened children’s immune system, experts say


&gt;Scientists are concerned that measures to combat Covid-19 have weakened the immune systems of young children who have not been able to build up resistance to common bugs, leaving them vulnerable when mask-wearing and social distancing eventually end.

&gt;Contact with viral pathogens happens on a fairly regular basis and although it does not always lead to sickness, the exposure helps shore the immune system against the threat should the bugs be encountered again.

&gt;Moore said she was particularly worried about the risk of RSV in young children. “We’ve got two cohorts now of children who’ve never met the virus, so they are susceptible, but there’s two years’ worth of them!”

A better measure would be hospitalizations, because that's what we're trying to avoid with the vaccine. Just cause people don't die doesn't mean they don't suffer during and post-covid.  Either way, here you go:

[https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/88-of-covid-fatalities-40-of-cases-in-45-age-group-govt-data/story-0RvZ2kT1CXMRonZjl6pGlL.html](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/88-of-covid-fatalities-40-of-cases-in-45-age-group-govt-data/story-0RvZ2kT1CXMRonZjl6pGlL.html)

From the article:`""...a majority (55%) of those who died of the viral disease were 60 years and older.""`   Which makes it 45% of deaths below 60 years, and that's a signification number of people below the age of 65 who died. Florida's vaccination rates below 65 have been pretty terrible.    


&gt; Cases aren't deaths. Young people are less likely to die or be seriously ill from covid.

Cases convert to hospitalizations and deaths, which lag case counts by a few weeks. This is why I mentioned India, Indonesia and Missouri as examples where hospitalizations had spiked. We'll see the results in FL in a few weeks.  I am not hopeful.   


&gt;Covid hospitalizations in Missouri today are still only like 30% of the winter peak.

As I mentioned, Delta is just getting started in the US. Missouri's hospitalizations are up within weeks, even with a portion of the state vaccinated.  FL doesn't seem far behind with a 4 fold case increase, which also occurred within a couple of weeks.

My intent isn't to scare monger.  You can survive this.

1. Get vaccinated. Wear a mask in public until several weeks after both shots.
2. Make sure your vitamin D levels are good.  Deficiency in D is strongly correlated to patient outcomes in many illnesses, including COVID-19.

Florida is not quite double the population of IL, so we're at about a third of the rate of Florida right now.

One difference with Illinois, though, is that at least the government has a clear set of criteria for restrictions, and should the positivity rate get back above 8% for 3 straight days, we should be going back to some restrictions which will hopefully help bring things back under control like it did in the past.

I do say *should* because I expect there will be significant pushback from people/politicians really not wanting to go back to restrictions ever again, but hopefully it will still happen.

If nothing else I will start putting myself under more restrictions again if we end up back there, possibly before then. I'm fully vaccinated and still wearing a mask inside of buildings already, but I might start avoiding going inside buildings again if it gets back up that high.

My own neighbor is a nurse and was laid off for a month or two last May. They literally didn’t have patients. A nurse was laid off when we were told hospitals were overloaded. It doesn’t jive with what the media fed us.

Covid isn't terribly dangerous for adolescents; it kills roughly 1 in 100,000 (about the same that chickpox did before the vaccine) and hospitalizes roughly 1 in 10,000.

For the Pfizer vaccine to be safer for adolescents than catching covid, it would have to kill fewer than 1 in 100,000, and would probably need to cause serious adverse impacts (roughly equivalent to being hospitalized with covid) in fewer than 1 in 10,000.

Based on what we've seen in adults, the vaccine is probably safer than covid for adolescents, but that study doesn't demonstrate it.

Everyone is acting like a third shot is 100% guaranteed no further discussion.  When in reality Pfizer is basically saying “we have enough evidence to approach the FDA to seek approval for a third shot”.

Let’s be clear on one thing here as well.  NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING has been decided yet.  Pfizer has NOT given the data that drove them to make said announce to the FDA and CDC for review and recommendations on a third dose.  It’s probably already in their hands from the trial oversight but largely that’s just looking for ethical or legal problems.

This is WHY the CDC came out saying that two doses is enough right now.  That’s because they haven’t done the review necessary for either agency to change their official recommendations.

This is a literal fight over semantics and whether Pfizer has the right to make an announcement like this.  Fun fact nothing Pfizer did was illegal.  Maybe a bit out of order (should’ve done a joint presser with FDA/CDC and a clearer worded message).  

But that doesn’t change the fact there is growing evidence that the vaccine does wane in individuals.  We’re not publicly given the rate and even as a med student they only tell us it wanes but not how fast. 

This is what the clinical trials are establishing and it’s an important step in the development of any vaccine.

Also talking about conflict of interests in the medicine manufacturing industry is a joke because they get to pick their test subjects, who they exclude, and basically what data they present to the FDA for clearance.  Until a third party independent reviewer is established to do the trials without influence from the parent company the results will ALWAYS have conflicted interests’ grubby little hands on them.

We opened up our nightclubs two weeks ago and our government told the youth to get vaccinated with the Jansen vaccin so they could go out. They called it ‘dansen met Jansen’ (dancing with Jansen). Of course al lot of people did that and a lot of them got infected. There was one club where of the 600 visitors over 200 tested positive after the weekend. And all of them had to either provide a negative test or a proof of vaccination (only 1 vaccin was sufficient, and there was no ‘wait period’) via our government regulated app before they could enter the club.

Combine that with the fact that festivals were opened, group restrictions were let go, and masks are no longer required et voila, you get this. 

Part of the old rules are now in place again. Nightclubs are closed and festival where people cannot stay in a restricted area are cancelled. You now have to wait 2 weeks after you got your vaccin before the app gives you a ‘go’ to go out without testing.

But yeah, this opening up plan and particularly the misleading information about the vaccin keeping you safe even if you just got it a couple of hours ago was definitely our government’s fault.

* **The 90-year-old died after contracting alpha and beta variants**
* **Co-infection rates likely underestimated from lack of testing**

A 90-year-old woman died after becoming infected with two different strains of Covid-19, revealing another risk in the fight against the disease, Belgian researchers found.

In the first peer-reviewed analysis of an infection with multiple strains, scientists found the woman had contracted both the alpha variant, which first surfaced in the U.K., and the beta strain, first found in South Africa. The infections probably came from separate people, according to a report published Saturday and presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology &amp; Infectious Diseases.

The woman was admitted to a Belgian hospital in March after a number of falls, and tested positive for Covid-19 the same day. She lived alone, receiving nursing care at home, and hadn’t been vaccinated. Her respiratory symptoms rapidly worsened and she died five days later. When her respiratory samples were tested for variants of concern, both strains were found in two tests. The researchers couldn’t say whether the co-infection played a role in her rapid deterioration.

The idea of multiple infections isn’t completely new. In January, Brazilian scientists reported two cases of Covid-19 co-infection, but the study hasn’t yet been released in a scientific journal. Researchers have also previously found evidence of people becoming infected with multiple strains of influenza. The cases suggest co-infection might be more common than currently known.

“The global occurrence of this phenomenon is probably underestimated due to limited testing for variants of concern and the lack of a simple way to identify co-infections with whole genome sequencing,” said Anne Vankeerberghen, the lead author of the study and a molecular biologist from OLV Hospital in Aalst, Belgium. “Being alert to co-infections remains crucial.”

Such instances also raise questions over how much protection vaccines can provide. With the rapidly spreading delta variant now the dominant strain in many places, including the U.K., drugmakers are rushing to test their shots against variants and create new versions that could provide a better defense. Countries are also mulling whether to offer booster shots this winter to guard against diminishing responses from vaccines.",,,1625996859,{},h4slbpi,True,t3_oi1li1,False,False,t3_oi1li1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oi1li1/woman_infected_with_two_covid19_variants/h4slbpi/,1626171169,30,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Sadly nobody with a brain helped with the setup of this system so these few problems still existed:

- if i would have gotten my second vacceine (or first if using jansen) i could drive straight to the bar/club and it wouldnt matter. No negative test, no waiting for the vacceine to start working.
-the negative test can be 48 hours old. Thats right, i can go 2 nights in a row to clubs and i only have to test once
- you can swap test results and vacceine proofs. It was just a QR code in a app (to log in, in the app you need your officals ID and all that stuff, but once unlocked it didnt matter, just a simple QR code.) so people used one QR code to get in 10-20 people…
-the testing that is required for partys were done by private labs/testing sites and lots of reports came in that the test were done badly. Some people claimed that the forgot the nose or only went just in it.

Basicly everybody between 14-35 went clubbing without a real protection against anything.

The reason I don't go to countries with cheap labor is not because I fear of exploiting them. The reason is high crime, water that you cannot drink and subpar healthcare.

I am not opposed to visiting Costa Rica though. It appears to be a safer country than most in the region and has a high life expectancy. Plus the food looks to be good.  Maybe the reason people go to the cheaper nations is that is all they can afford.

Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean said in a Facebook post that the ship carried two tanks with 40 tonnes of liquid oxygen,500 cylinders of oxygen and 570 oxygen concentrators.

The delivery came after phone calls between Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investments Luhut Pandjaitan - who is coordinating the nation's Covid-19 response - and Mr Teo, said the latter in his post.

""As Indonesia’s close neighbour and partner, Singapore will continue to work in close cooperation with Indonesia to support their efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic,"" said the MFA spokesman.

Singapore's Minister of Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan, who was at Paya Lebar Air Base to preside over a handover ceremony of the medical supplies last Friday morning, said Singaporeans stand in solidarity with Indonesia in its fight against the pandemic.

Singapore tightened border measures for travellers from Indonesia on Saturday, following a spike in Covid-19 cases there.

The Health Ministry said approvals for travellers from Indonesia who are not citizens or permanent residents of Singapore would be reduced with immediate effect.

Indonesia reported 35,094 Covid-19 cases and 826 deaths on Saturday, bringing its total so far to more than 2.49 million cases and 65,457 deaths.

The Indonesian authorities extended Covid-19 restrictions to 15 new locations across the archipelago last Friday, in a bid to avert the crisis seen on the island of Java, where hospitals are being pushed to the limit, oxygen supplies are low, and four of five designated Covid-19 burial grounds in the capital Jakarta are close to full.",,,1626010926,{},h4t2o13,True,t3_oi2h15,False,False,t3_oi2h15,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oi2h15/singapore_navy_ship_leaves_with_lifesaving_oxygen/h4t2o13/,1626180573,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

So the 20+ thousand volunteers that recived the vaccine dont count?


&gt;studies don't look at any long term effects it might have

Although COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are new, this type of vaccine has been studied in people before. mRNA vaccines against HIV, rabies, Zika and flu have been tested in phase 1 and phase 2 trials in people. The technology has also been used in clinical trials as a way to treat some cancers. Even though these products have not been licensed for use in people, these efforts provided important information about mRNA technology and its safety.

History shows this is a common pattern. When new vaccines are released, the unknown side effects, if any, show up within two months of vaccination. This history goes back to at least the 1960s with the oral polio vaccine and examples continue through today.

Because of this, scientists and public health officials continually monitor vaccine data before, during and after a vaccine becomes available to the public.

Researchers have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines for decades. mRNA vaccines have been studied before for influenza, Zika and rabies. Beyond vaccines, cancer research has used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target specific cancer cells, which im sure you're aware of. 

It's okay to have concerns, sure. But people need to look in to it themselves rather than listening to some fearmongering grifter.

That's completely untrue.  Scott Morrisson has even laid out a roadmap for moving from elimination to endemic covid in four phases.  The Australian govt invested in multiple vaccines in mid-2020 and assured the populace they would be the front of the queue for vaccines.  

&gt;Oh sure they are talking the vaccination talk but their actions have demonstrated a lack of resolve on that front up until very recently.

That's comletely different from what you claimed above, that they thought lockdowns are a permanent solution.  Australia messed up their vaccine campaign by betting too heavily on AZ and their homegrown one which had to be abandoned.  When they failed they rushed to secure others, but now are the back of the queue.  

There is a big difference between messing up the vaccine roll-out and not being bothered about it at all.  Australia had a huge outbreak last year.  They weren't relaxed about Covid at all.

My coworker took the same shot the same day as her husband and her own side effects were very mild.

My coworker is not an anti-vaxxer.  She was and still is pro-vaccine and believes people in general should be vaccinated against covid because she still believes side effects are rare.

I have a couple ""friends"" at work who I don't mind hanging out with outside of work, but that's about it. I have no need to spend more time with anyone else at work.

Having said that, I am a clerical at a law office, and probably 80% of my job can only be done from the office (mailings especially - though if I had the right tech and printer at home, I could theoretically do that from home). I also have to organize physical documents for attorneys and help them with depositions and stuff, which requires me to be in the same vicinity as them. 

Regardless, our supervisors have said that we're probably switching to a hybrid system after Labor Day, where we'll likely spend 3 days in the office and 2 days working from home, and everyone will probably switch schedules week-to-week.

Source: https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/covid-19-vaccine-trials-for-young-children-proceed-at-yale/  
Date: April 23, 2021  
&gt; The effort to evaluate COVID-19 vaccines in even younger children is now moving forward. Inci Yildirim, MD, PhD, associate professor of pediatrics (infectious diseases) at Yale School of Medicine, will lead Yale’s component of Moderna’s clinical trial of a vaccine for children 6 months to 12 years of age. Called KidCOVE, the phase 2/3 trial is being conducted at approximately 90 sites across the U.S. and Canada and will include 6,750 children.  
  
&gt;Yildirim, a vaccinologist, says evidence suggests that even beyond its contribution to herd immunity, vaccinating young children could protect their own health more than people assumed when the pandemic began. “As the pandemic evolved we have learned many things that we didn’t know initially,” says Yildirim. “We learned in fact that children can get infected and develop severe disease requiring intensive care unit admissions. We have seen children transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to other children and adults in summer camp or family gatherings.”  
  
&gt;There also is a concern that so-called “long COVID” may have lasting or recurring effects for the children themselves, as Ogbuagu explains. “We know that people have had long COVID symptoms even if they weren’t hospitalized and these symptoms can persist for longer than a typical illness,” he says. It is yet another reason to want very young children to be vaccinated safely and effectively.
Testing children’s vaccines is more complicated.  
  
&gt;Yildirim says trials for children younger than 12 will be far more complicated than adult trials like one for Moderna in which she was an investigator last year, and will take more time to complete. “A clinical trial for a children’s COVID-19 vaccine requires the consideration of many additional factors,” she explains. “Children are not little adults. As children grow and develop, their immune system grows and develops. A 16-month-old is not the same as a 16-year-old. They are both children, but their capacity to respond to the vaccines is not the same.”  
  
&gt;The protocol Yildirim will follow was developed in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Moderna. It consists of two parts: the first, which seeks to determine a safe dose of the antigen; and the second, to test whether the dose is effective. This is called an “age de-escalation/dose escalation” study. Participants are placed in three groups: 6 to 12 years old, 2 to 6 years old, and 6 months to 2 years old.",,,1625957174,{},h4qzgei,False,t3_ohliiv,False,False,t1_h4quou0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ohliiv/delta_variant_sparks_covid_outbreak_in_oklahoma/h4qzgei/,1626140897,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

To my knowledge, there has been no talk of naturally immune individuals losing immunity en masse (despite many of them having immunity for nearly two years now), meanwhile it is already being discussed, after 6 months of vaccine rollout, that booster shots will soon be recommended or required in the coming months due to waning immunity from vaccinations. If you can provide studies that show people with natural immunity are already shedding immunity en masse, I would like to see them.

&gt; its efficacy isn’t as consistent.

Again, to my knowledge, reinfection among others previously recovered patients is extremely rare, even when it accounts for people who tested positive again with zero symptoms or illness.  Hospitalization and death rates of those reinfected are low to nil.  However, breakthrough cases among the vaccinated are so common that the CDC says they are not recommending testing for the vaccinated UNLESS they are showing severe cases of covid infections, so the true rate of mild breakthrough cases is unknown. But since they stress that vaccines do not prevent infection or transmission and only largely eliminate hospitalizations and deaths from infections, we can presume mild breakthrough cases are not rare.

The delta and lambda variants are too new for any research to have passed peer review yet. But preliminary data does show a higher infection rate and severity among healthy, younger patients than previous variants.

But you know what? I just want to explain what you're not getting.

We have statistics and it turns out most things stay pretty consistent. Yes factors can and do change but overall they stay pretty much the same at least in a 5 year time-frame.

When we talk about excess deaths, if July normally 100k people die, and sure the average has been 100k +/- 5k so 95k to 105k, then suddenly with covid its 110k but only 2k deaths are reported due to covid...

It doesn't take a rocket surgeon to figure that out. They do estimate overall deaths caused by covid is double, we have reported even from India showing death counts were undercounted by a factor of 6 during the last wave during some weeks.

Yes it was 4k dying, it was 20k a day for a period of time of excess deaths during the wave.

The same reports in the US exist but not as bad, like 70% higher. Canada my country announced ours are nearly 100% off so a factor of two.

Russia admitted early on their deaths were undercounted by a factor of 3. That was 5 months ago. They also admitted it again.

So I dunno that's just off the top of my head remembering.

Even if some places over counted, or more aptly they aren't admitting to overcounting but the ones they counted some may have been wrong.

Aka 4k excess deaths.

2k labeled covid they find out 400 weren't covid.

Well turns out the other 2k was covid, and of those 4k the covid was likely 3.6k if that makes sense.",,,1625962433,{},h4r8qlv,False,t3_ohfxsb,False,False,t1_h4qka4j,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ohfxsb/the_worlds_known_covid_death_toll_passes_four/h4r8qlv/,1626145958,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Why am I being asked a question about me?  I'm simply describing what I read.  Doing so is not from some special ""need"" to assert anything (""that it is..."" that what is?)

&gt;I haven’t gotten the Covid disease even when I was literally out in the public in close quarters the entire pandemic including the beggining where no one had any precautions. 

This describes someone's personal experience where as the assertion (that its ""less"" lethal) is  one that appears to fly in the face of knowledge *about* the disease.  

Knowledge *about* it to have any validity requires a source. 

I gave one.  It wasn't out of a ""need"" to assert. I'm simply presenting information because a number of people have gotten it fouled up and would not if they actually read.

So I posted it here to demark - ""here's what we know"" as opposed to ""here's what I a random reddit user conjecture.""


&gt;I’m probably more likely to have this one but even less of a chance (compared to the 2%chance of dying with the first one) stop fear mongering. 

There is absolutely no fear mongering going on here.  Stop making personal statements about reddit users who are simply referring to facts.

If there is some counter claim - the post it.  All I did was post what I found.  That is not ""fear mongering.""  That's simply straightening things out. If there is a counter claim, make it. And show where its from. 

The whole point of information sharing here is for us to ""get out of the way"" and point to what we find.

There have been about half a billion infections around the world. The number of vaccins is two or three times that, as it is far more than a billion now.

Number of people who died of the virus is 4 million officially, so up to 0.8%. But the number of people who died due to side effects of the vaccins is at most maybe 100.

The vaccins have been tested since roughly a year ago. This virus itself is known for just 1.5 years.

All in all the vaccin is much much safer.

But you are correct that the side effects are real for quite a few people. I also known several people who were ill for a day or two.

Then again I know at least two people who died from the virus, including a 40 year old father of two kids

Mohammed Bamba of the Orlando Magic and Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics are two NBA players who have openly discussed the long road back from Covid. 

Moncada, one of the top prospects in baseball, finally had a breakout season in 2019 when he hit .315 with 25 home runs for Chicago. He tested positive for the virus before starting the shortened season the next year and saw his numbers steeply decline. Moncada ended 2020, hitting .225 with six home runs. His OPS fell from .915 to .705.

Tommy Sweeney of the Buffalo Bills was one of the first NFL players to develop a season-ending condition from Covid complications. He developed myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart muscle. This is often developed after viral infections and goes undetected in many people.
myocarditis is the cause of 5 to 22 percent of sudden cardiac death in athletes under 35 years old.


Ryquell Armstead of the Jacksonville Jaguars was hospitalized twice due to complications.


Asia Durr has no timeline to return to basketball as she recovers from long covid symptoms. Durr was the No. 2 overall pick in the 2019 WNBA Draft.

Now you may notice in the interpretation section that it was found safe with a reasonable tolerability profile. You might also notice that it also stated that the vaccine can induce boostable functional antibodies against a viral antigen when administered with a needle-free device, 

although not when injected by a needle-syringe.

This issue was adressed with recent R&amp;D

here.

The Challenges
1. Instability
Protein expression after the vaccine is administered might be insufficient if, for instance, the half-life of the vaccine is too low, or if in vivo mRNA translation is insufficient11,12.

2. Inefficient in vivo delivery
mRNA vaccine delivery is tricky. For instance, mRNA can aggregate with serum proteins and undergoes rapid extracellular degradation by RNases. Therefore, formulating mRNAs into carrier molecules is often necessary, and delivery formulations need to take into account factors such as the biodistribution of the vaccine after delivery, mRNA uptake, and protein translation rate13,14.

3. Safety
The complexity of modulating the immunogenicity of the mRNA used in vaccines can potentially lead to unwanted stimulatory effects on the immune response15,16,17.

The Recent Advances
1. Optimization of mRNA translation and stability
Sequence optimization techniques such as replacing rare codons with more frequently used synonymous codons18, as well as enrichment of G:C content16, have been examined for increasing in vivo protein expression.

2. Progress in mRNA vaccine delivery
There are numerous delivery methods for mRNA vaccines that have been examined in the literature. In recent years, the limitations of some of these, such as using physical methods (e.g., electroporation) to penetrate the cell membrane, were demonstrated19. On the other hand, progress was made toward the increased efficacy and reduced toxicity of other delivery methods such as cationic lipid and polymer-based delivery13,16,20,21.

3. Modulation of immunogenicity
Recent studies have demonstrated that the immunostimulatory profile of mRNA can be controlled more precisely using a variety of techniques. These include chromatographic purification to remove double-stranded RNA contaminants, the introduction of naturally-occurring modified nucleosides to prevent the activation of unwanted innate immune sensors, and complexing the mRNA with various carrier molecules (this includes novel approaches to adjuvants that take advantage of the intrinsic immunogenicity of mRNA)15,17,22,33.

Apart from the advances in techniques such as purification and the introduction of nucleosides, there was also an improvement in the understanding of when these techniques should be used, based on factors such as the mRNA platform used, RNA sequence optimization, and the extent of mRNA purification under consideration16,24
