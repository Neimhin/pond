CDC:

&gt; The VaST session on May 17, 2021, included several presentations on myocarditis following mRNA vaccines, from the Department of Defense (DoD), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), and Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD). There were also brief updates from the Veteran‚Äôs Administration (VA) and the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) groups about their plans for future investigation of myocarditis.

&gt; VaST concluded that there are relatively few reports of myocarditis to date and that these cases  seem to occur:

&gt; * predominantly in adolescents and young adults,

&gt; * more often in males than females,

&gt; * more often following dose 2 than dose 1, and

&gt; * typically within 4 days after vaccination.

&gt; Most cases appear to be mild, and follow-up of cases is ongoing.

&gt; Within CDC safety monitoring systems, rates of myocarditis reports in the window following COVID-19 vaccination have not differed from expected baseline rates. However, VaST members felt that information about reports of myocarditis should be communicated to providers.

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/work-groups-vast/technical-report-2021-05-17.html

EMA (European regulator) says:

&gt; EMA is aware of cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane around the heart) mainly reported following vaccination with Comirnaty. There is no indication at the moment that these cases are due to the vaccine. However, PRAC has requested the marketing authorisation holder to provide further detailed data, including an analysis of the events according to age and gender, in the context of the next pandemic summary safety report and will consider if any other regulatory action is needed. Additionally, the PRAC has requested the marketing authorisation holder for COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna ‚Äì also an mRNA vaccine ‚Äì to monitor similar cases with their vaccine and to also provide a detailed analysis of the events in the context of the next pandemic summary safety report. EMA will communicate further when new information becomes available.

""The aim of our world-leading events research programme is to examine the risk of COVID-19 transmission at large events and explore how crowds can be welcomed back in bigger numbers safely,"" a government spokesman said.

A portion of the ""wait and see"" crowd *have* shifted, but a portion of the ""wait and see"" crowd is just saying that because they believe the interviewer wants to hear that. Your numbers don't include ""only if required"" in the ""anti-vax"" column when in principle it is the exact same thing. 

At best, real anti-vax sentiment is at least 20% and most likely closer to 25%. That jives well with the data (we will get past 70% of adults, but not much over - 75% is a logical cap, if not a bit below that).",,,1621866276,{},gz9xmxy,True,t3_njgtgg,False,True,t1_gz9v4cg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/njgtgg/us_administers_2857_million_doses_of_covid19/gz9xmxy/,1621938800,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I'm asking questions pertinent to the UK because this is a UK story. 

&gt;first question: pause the unvaccinated from games and concerts? yes, definitely until this deadly virus is no more

Ok. Why? The spread in the UK is near zero, and by the 21st of June (when games and concerts can continue in earnest), it is likely that the UK population will have reached herd immunity or something close to it.

What is the point of preventing unvaccinated people from taking part in these events if them doing so doesn't contribute to the spread of the virus? What is the public health requirement for imposing a ¬£200 fine on an 18 year old who wants to go and watch the football with their dad?

Also, it does kind of matter whether you think that these rules should apply to restaurants, pubs, theatres, sporting activities and social contact, because these are the things which have only just opened up again in the UK. Again, restricting them requires a heavy justification in terms of the public health benefit.

&gt;second : the vaccinated don't get infected and don't spread because the vaccines work like magic. 

Ok, neither of those points is true. The vaccines aren't 100% effective at all.

&gt;what to do? allow only vaccinated to go back to a normal life and impose a mask to all the unvaccinated. Simple

But you're not talking about imposing a mask on people, you're talking about restricting people from taking part in certain activities.",,,1621874092,{},gzaeonz,False,t3_njleh3,False,True,t1_gza9fe3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/njleh3/uk_sees_just_15_covid19_cases_from_events/gzaeonz/,1621949011,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This is true to an extent.  Avoiding the comparison to ducks, humans require work in a complex social structure.  A bad mom can be mitigated by other factors such as having a good dad that takes full custody, or grandparents, or in worst case scenarios where the entire family is bad the government can step in and remove kids from a harmful situation at home.

However, there are definitely limits and humans almost always need to place their children into the hands of others for care.  So schools, daycares, doctors offices, playgrounds, etc. are all factors.  

On top of that, with a virus it's pretty difficult to be 100% certain that they're safe, depending on your life circumstances.  If you live in an apartment building with some sort of shared ventilation or in a house with other relatives, you can't fully control what the other people around you are doing to be safe.

Not my job to educate you on this, and it certainly isn't because I say so, i'm just a random redditor :P History has plenty of examples for you to refer too if you wish.

&gt;What is the point of fair if it is less than optimal?

Look how entitled and upset you are about the rollout. Plenty of people feel just like you. In fact, there is no way of doing this where SOMEONE would't have their panties in a bunch, at least doing it in the way we have is defensible. Wait your turn, like everyone else. Like it or not, that's just how it is.

&gt;You don't like the idea of the rich getting it before the poor

It's got nothing to do with wealth, and everything to do with actual risk. Older/unwell first, because the virus is more deadly to this group. Simple, fair, easy to justify when people complain they didn't get one yet. Your group may be mad about things right now, and I get that, but if we did it any other way the complaints would be just as loud if not more so, and much harder to rationalize. Vaccinate the most at risk first is an easy concept to wrap your head around.

Then all you need is a few things: breakthrough case data that includes the date, the vaccine type, and the case severity, and non breakthrough case data that includes the date and case severity. Then for all cases within a certain date range where the vaccination rate is relatively stable, you find the percentage of people with a particular vaccination type that had breakthrough cases, and divide it by the percentage of unvaccinated people that had cases. 1 minus this fraction gives you the efficacy of that vaccination type in decimal form. Repeat for hospitalizations and deaths, and repeat across all vaccination types.

That should give you good, solid, real world data, though with some limitations since it's not a tightly controlled study. I could see the argument that the case efficacy might be bad data as vaccinated people might be less likely to get tested, so I could see the need for a placebo group with that. However, I think this method would at least give good data for the hospitalizations and deaths at least.

However, from what I can find, the CDC is not releasing the composition of breakthrough cases by vaccination type. They are also only releasing all breakthrough cases ever recorded, instead of breakthrough cases by week or month.

[],,vitorgrs,,,[],,,,text,t2_pjahg,False,False,[],"&gt; A primitive virus, present in humans for thousands of years, may be being activated by coronavirus and causing increased deaths in critically ill patients. The hypothesis is part of a study coordinated by Funda√ß√£o Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz) that may help to understand why some critically ill patients undergoing mechanical ventilation are able to leave the ICU, while others do not survive the Covid-19.  

&gt; The research indicates that the presence of human endogenous retrovirus family K (HERV-K) is associated not only with worsening of the disease but also with early mortality. From March to December 2020, the study ""Activation of Human Endogenous Retrovirus K in the Lower Respiratory Tract of Patients with Severe Covid-19 Associated with Early Mortality"" followed 25 people in critical condition who required mechanical ventilation. With a mean age of 57 years, they were admitted to Instituto D'Or and Instituto Estadual do C√©rebro Paulo Niemeyer.


&gt; ""The progression from mild to severe cases had been associated with hypoxia, uncontrolled inflammation and coagulopathy. However, the mechanisms involved with mortality in very severe cases are still not well known. For this, the study sought to understand the virome of tracheal aspirate from individuals on mechanical ventilation - that is, the viruses present in the sample. The tests showed high levels of HERV-K, compared to tests of patients with mild cases and non-infected patients"", explained Fiocruz.

&gt; The study coordinator was Thiago Moreno, from the Centre for Technological Development in Health (CDTS/Fiocruz). ""We checked the virome of a population with a very high severity, in which the mortality rate reaches 80% to see if any other virus was coinfecting this patient who is debilitated, immunosuppressed. Our surprise was to find these high levels of endogenous retrovirus K. It is the type of research that starts from a complete non-biased approach. This gives a lot of strength, a lot of credibility to the finding,"" the scientist explained.

&gt; Ancestor
&gt; According to the study, HERV-K is an endogenous retrovirus, an ancestral virus that infected the human genome when humans and chimpanzees were decoupling on the evolutionary scale. Some of these genetic elements are present in our chromosomes. Many are silent for most of our lives, but it seems that somehow Sars-CoV-2 may have reactivated this ancestral retrovirus. The death rate in severe covid-19 patients is as high as 50% among those with high levels of HERV-K.

&gt; The study also established a direct link: by infecting a healthy person's cell with Sars-CoV-2 in the laboratory, there was an increase in HERV-K levels. ""We established, in fact, that Sars-CoV-2 is the trigger for the increase in these endogenous retroviruses, to awaken the silent genes,"" Moreno said.

&gt; Along with the increased levels of HERV-K in the patients, the researchers noticed that clotting factors were more consumed, more inflammatory processes occurred, and the numbers of factors needed for immune system cell survival decreased. As HERV-K levels increased, the numbers of activated inflamed monocytes also grew. ""These HERV-K levels correlated with what was called early mortality, such as less than 28 days of hospitalisation,"" says Thiago.

&gt; Silent genes
&gt; The research is still the first evidence of the presence of this retrovirus in the respiratory tract and plasma of severe Covid-19 patients. The presence of HERV-K, which also occurs in other diseases, such as cancer and multiple sclerosis, may be used as a biomarker associated to severity in covid-19 cases. Its early detection could reinforce the use of certain strategies, such as the use of anticoagulants and anti-inflammatory drugs.

&gt; But it is still difficult to know why this occurs in some people and not in others. ""This awakening of silent genes is what can make the difference in evolutions. Maybe the signal for silencing certain endogenous retroviruses is stronger in some people than in others. It seems to be associated to the gravity this capacity of the new coronavirus to change the epigenetic profile of the host cell, activating even ancestral viruses, some of them that should be asleep in our genome"", commented the coordinator of the study.

""Long COVID has been answered a long time ago as post-viral fatigue, something that can happen with any virus combined with anxiety. Novel implies we've never seen anything like this virus. COVID is not at all unique. It is so similar to SARS that people who had SARS have natural immunity to COVID 17 years later (this is why I believe Asia did as well as it did btw). It follows the same path as every other respiratory virus (including influenza). Notice how just about no one gets the flu in the summer? That's the same logic we saw last summer (when no one was vaccinated) and now (I believe next month in the Sun Belt will be the first real test of vaccines, particularly in somewhere as vaccinated as LA).

Dude literally said they have never seen anything like this and it looks like we are at war or something. 150-200-300 bodies a day.

Although I haven't directly interacted with people from other states I have heard similar stories from friends and family there as well. Especially Gujarat, Maharashtra and UP. 

&gt;80k to 90k a day is too many to hide.

Which is why it isn't hidden. Bodies are floating on rivers, helicopters and satellites are able to see the burial / burning grounds light up at night. International news is covering this.

As for Japan, it's more than just going by age groups.  Let's say you figure out that you're going to allow 80-90 yr olds first.  The Japanese approach is that you then figure out who all the 80-90 yr olds are in your county.  Then you schedule all of then and plot it out on a calendar.  Then you want to allow 70-80 yr olds.  So you have to figure out who all they are too and get them scheduled.  You have to do this for every single age group.  Then you have to figure out exactly how much vaccine you need for each age group and work out the logistics to get it all there exactly when you need it. Now that you have every single age group mapped out and you know exactly how much vaccine you need and when then you have to find places to administer the vaccine and make all of those arrangements and deal with any staffing issues.

[],,grumble11,,,[],,,,text,t2_11opqr,False,False,[],"Alrighty, I‚Äôll try to address these points.

1. We are talking about the costs of locking down, not the costs of covid itself. The cost of covid itself is largely borne by the old, as well as some the already very unwell and to a moderate degree the middle aged. Yes, young people can and do get sick from covid but the actual disease itself is broadly far more significant for the old. Few would argue that point. Again, we‚Äôre talking lockdown costs (and perks), not covid itself. Covid reduction and avoidance benefits accrue mostly to older, more vulnerable generations. While middle aged people can get very ill and die of covid (and the tipping point for aggregate cost and benefit may reside somewhere in that group), the risk is exponential as you get older and most ICU admissions and deaths are in people of retirement age.

2. Older people do not universally have high financial assets, and some old people may in fact be suffering financially from this. I did not make the claim that this is universal, and trying to portray my argument as such is dishonest. I make the claim that many older people who are no longer working and are living off their financial assets have benefited from the lockdown. If you‚Äôre an older homeowner with some stocks and bonds, you likely had a windfall as central banks cut rates to zero and injected massive QE into markets, spiking asset prices. Young people are the ones who pay for this as they are not asset rich, and the price of those assets (and their expected future return) have gotten bad. This is very serious and it is my belief it will damage the entire economic trajectory of that generation.

3. Older people who have finished their careers are not impacted by the interruption to work and schooling that has happened - not in the workforce, so nothing to interrupt there, and not being educated, so nothing there either. Many will probably not really experience the impact that this has socially - a less educated and productive workforce weakens a nation, but that is a slow effect they may not live to see. Young people will absolutely feel that, both socially and personally as so many have had their careers and education directly compromised.

4. You know full well that my ‚Äòno old people in society‚Äô comment was a thought experiment and your criticism as if it wasn‚Äôt was disingenuous. It is simply there to demonstrate that in the absence of a large older population to whom the covid avoidance benefits of a lockdown are well worth the costs, there would not have been one as the other groups are in aggregate harmed more by lockdowns than they benefit from covid avoidance. 

I understand that this is an issue that you have a lot of emotional investment in due to your sick child, and I‚Äôm glad that the lockdowns helped protect them - I‚Äôm not sure that ignoring the aggregate reality that young people bore the brunt of the lockdown costs and old people got the vast majority of the benefit is necessary to still be personally happy (due to your situation) that lockdowns happened.",,,1621870130,{},gza5wsw,False,t3_njleh3,False,False,t1_gz9lg02,/r/Coronavirus/comments/njleh3/uk_sees_just_15_covid19_cases_from_events/gza5wsw/,1621943635,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

What matters the most is that my parents just had their first shot.

She told me you have to take whatever you are offered no matter what it is.

I felt I would be better personally to go without than to get the wrong type (I'm not against it in general and would be happy to take an mrna one) but she didn't want to hear it.

In the US there have been over 500,000 deaths related to COVID-19, but fewer than 300 of those have been kids under 18. There have also been studies showing that while kids are less affected when they are infected, they become infected, and transmit COVID-19 at much lower rates than adults.

We are well beyond the point where it is too dangerous for kids to be back in school.

Gonna start dropping vaccine projections for NJ in case anyone is interested. Only have 4 days worth of data so may be a little premature and numbers will likely fluctuate over the next three days due to that and not the actual uptake rate. I used estimates from the CDC including population numbers that are close to 10 years old and about 5 percent low. So for the most part each percent estimate is about 4-5 percent higher than it should be but for sake of consistency I will stick with the 2010 census estimate the CDC uses. 

5.199 million NJ residents with 1st dose - 58.5% 

(5.182 million - 58.3% yesterday)

5.020 million 18+ with 1st dose - 72.3%

(5.009 million - 72.1% yesterday)

89.3% of 65+ have first dose (89.3% yesterday)

At this rate, the first dose shots will reach these percentages on these dates. 

Total Population Numbers(58.5 % Now)

60% - 5/29

65% - 6/14

70% - 6/29

18+ Numbers (72.3% Now)

75% - 6/3

80% - 6/22

85% - 7/10

65+ Numbers (89.3% Now)

90% - 7/17

95% - 8/28

On May 9, Laos saw its first Covid death in a 53-year-old Vietnamese female karaoke worker and recorded its second fatality on May 14 when a 29-year-old man fell victim to the virus.",,,1621856197,{},gz9gd4i,False,t3_njvhjs,False,False,t3_njvhjs,/r/Coronavirus/comments/njvhjs/laos_countrys_perfect_covid19_record_ends_as_it/gz9gd4i/,1621929170,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Personally, I view the Vox video as pure propaganda and J&amp;J definitely seems worse than the mRNA vaccines. We can compare efficacy as we already do - to 50% to see if a vaccine is good enough.

However, J&amp;J is a great vaccine. As one person put it, it's an A tier vaccine while the mRNA ones are S tier. Part of what this means is that delaying even a few weeks to wait for an mRNA one can be worse than just getting the J&amp;J. My family and I were in the same situation as your mom, and we all got the J&amp;J even with me believing that most of the pro J&amp;J stuff we keep hearing is propaganda. It is so much better than nothing that I would not be upset with your mom, she was probably right to get it and is so much safer than she was. Additionally, the one argument I agree with that all the propaganda videos are ignoring is that the efficacy seems to increase. The CDC says that you are fully vaccinated after 2 weeks but the data indicates you are far safer at 8 weeks. If you are really concerned for her, then I would recommend you advise her to act as if she is not fully vaccinated until 8 weeks afterwards.

On the other hand, what is really upsetting me is that due to all the pro J&amp;J propaganda, I can't get the info that I need to figure out how we should handle things going forwards. Should we be masking up when other vaccinated people aren't? Will we need an mRNA booster before visiting other countries that aren't vaccinated? My wife is from South Africa and wants to visit her family so that is an important question for us. Unfortunately, I can't figure this out as no one is giving info on how J&amp;J is doing in the real world, such as posting the breakthrough cases and which vaccine they are from. All I can figure is that the CDC is too afraid to scare people away from the vaccine if they give raw info about breakthrough cases, which to me feels like they are twisting the data to fit the messaging they want to, which I strongly disagree with.

You want my reasoning? It's unnecessary. Proper Healthcare is without a doubt the best way to fight covid. I take care of myself, I'm on a vitamin D regimine, I cut out sugars which are a massive factor in compromising your immune system etc etc.
I already had covid, I have the antibodies. The vaccine doesn't prevent you from getting covid. It lessens your symptoms. Plus there are incredibly effective treatment methods for covid. The FDA may say there aren't but hey, by law a vaccine can't be approved if there are proven methods of treatment. And given they are the same people who told us oxycontin was totally safe and virtually impossible to overdose on or get addicted to, well they sort of lost my vote of confidence. This isn't some conspiracy theory bullshit, it's proven science. I have a doctor and 3 nurses in my family, all of whom have worked in NYC the entire pandemic. I trust the people who have been surrounded by covid more than the govt agency which can't make up its mind.

The variant has been circulating for weeks now and case numbers in the US continue to decline.  And more studies come out every day confirming the protection our vaccines are providing against the known variants.

The news out of the UK that we've seen has been good: B.1.617.2 cases are definitely doubling there weekly, and they've given more total doses than the US.

2.	19 of 28 airport workers were vaccinated, so 9 of them weren‚Äôt and were most likely the ones who spread it.
3.	None of the cases have resulted in serious illness or death.

It‚Äôs known that vaccinated people can carry the virus (and test positive) but the amount of virus is so small that it doesn‚Äôt result in even symptoms a lot of the time.  The small viral load is also why spread from vaccinated individuals is very unlikely.  

I keep seeing this Singapore airport along with the New York Yankees breakthrough cases stories being brought up to stir up alarm.  But again, both of these examples show that while carrying the virus is possible, if you don‚Äôt get sick and don‚Äôt spread it does it really matter??

Finally, I don‚Äôt get why some people can put so much attention to these kinds of isolated stories (which again, show the vaccines work) and seem to ignore the fact that the population as a whole is doing amazing right now because of vaccines.

Think about it, with the amount of people vaccinated, if the chance of catching and becoming seriously ill from COVID were even .1%, there would be 1,290 cases of severe COVID among the vaccinated out there.  

I haven‚Äôt even heard of one, and you know the media would jump on it.  

The fact is that the crazy efficacy of the vaccines from clinical trials is being shown to happen in the real world.  95% against hospitalization (remember that‚Äôs 95% less hospitalization than the control group, it doesn‚Äôt mean 5% chance of being hospitalized) and 100% against death.

There are some special considerations for teenagers 14-18 undergoing major procedures or being hospitalized. But for basic healthcare you even get full privacy protections from your parents. At 14, I could have gone to the doctor and gotten any necessary vaccinations without my parents' knowledge. If I had a disease I didn't want my parents to know about, I could see a doctor and get a prescription without any reference to my parents. My parents were very pro modern medicine and I didn't have anything embarassing going on so it didn't come up much. But I did enjoy the freedom and flexibility of not having to bother with permission slips and being able to go to the doctor alone.

Obviously this is a lot easier in a place with universal healthcare. I just presented my medicare card (or number and expiry date) and the government paid the clinic. My parents' job or ability to pay was totally irrelevant. But it always surprises me when laws seem to treat 17yo the same as babies. An older teenager may lack some of the life experience, maturity and judgment to make all their own decisions, but they have some significant abilities and agency and the law should respect that.

So combine that, and you are at something like 80-85% decreased chance of somebody with a vaccine catching covid and passing it on, compared to an unvaccinated person. 

With an R0 of about 3 for COVID, you need a population-wide 67% reduction in chance of catching and spreading an infection to stop the growth of an outbreak. This would be achieved at 80-85% vaccination rate, with these numbers.

That is an achievable threshold. Eapecially once you consider some existing population immunity from previous infection.

UK, for instance, is over 95% vaccine uptake (first dose) in the older age groups that have been eligible for a while, and likely to track to 90% uptake in the younger groups.

Taiwan's TSMC is world-leading in producing semiconductors, both in terms of technological edge and market share.

These semiconductors are a vital part of pretty much all electronics: computers, phones, consoles, cars - you name it. The pandemic has however lead to a world-wide shortage of these semiconductors. The reasons are many, but include increased demand due to WFH and economic turmoil leading to cancelled and then re-added orders from car manufacturers (creating huge backlogs). TSMC is also facing other problems like droughts. New factories are being built but will take years to complete.

But what does this have to do with covid? Well, Taiwan has done very well during this whole pandemic by being able to keep the virus out of its borders. But recently there has been a surge in cases, and vaccines are a scarcity outside of the US, UK, EU, Canada and a few other countries.

Not really, seems the long term effect is a strong resistance to infection by Covid-19, although newer variants show some breakthrough compared to effectiveness on the original Wuhan strain.

I think one of the big differences is when kids are home, you'll get some who claim tech issues to get out of work, or they have made very simple mistakes that can be solved in 5 seconds by anyone who knows where they should be going/what they should be doing.  Most of those parents won't know it's a lie or how to take care of something simple and we swap the device just to find the one that came back was perfectly fine.  Most teachers deal with that stuff when kids are in person and these things don't ever make it to us.

We also got a few kids where parents kept telling us there was something wrong with the device because they were getting videos coming up all the time.  No, your kid spends most of their time deliberately looking up Minecraft videos and I have the filter logs to prove it.  In person, when a teacher is hovering around a room, this is a non-issue.

We are also rural and a few of our towns have lousy internet service.  We provided hotspots, but in many situations homes are in areas with very weak cell coverage so they aren't a great option either.  That was an obstacle for them to join classes and see/hear their teacher and classmates.

To top that off, we had a huge amount of social media issues (bullying, etc.) that administration dealt with when kids came back.  This happens all the time, but never at this scale.  I believe it was so much worse because kids weren't seeing each other in person and had nothing but those outlets.

The USA is holding back raw materials that are urgently needed for vaccine production, criticizes Ingmar Hoerr. He considers the demand to waive patent rights to be ‚Äúpurely populist‚Äù.

Q: Mr. Hoerr, you have chosen strong words in the debate on patent protection for vaccines.

Hoerr: You get a ‚Äúmess‚Äù when you use the patents of Biontech, Curevac or Moderna without knowing the exact assembly instructions. 

Q: You even warn of a health risk in a post on Linkedin. What do you mean by that exactly?

Hoerr: With patents, at best, you have a rough recipe with which you can somehow try to cook something. That is what I mean by a ""mess"". To do this, you have to understand the company's patent strategy: Since knowledge is disclosed with every patent, every company takes care to keep certain things secret and not to patent them. That then remains internal knowledge. I therefore consider the demand to release patents to be purely populist.

Q: By copying the ‚Äúrough recipe‚Äù a new vaccine would be created that would then need to be approved.

Hoerr: Exactly. It is a mystery to me how that could work in the near future. The necessary clinical trials always take a long time. 

Q: Does the demand to waive patent rights mean perhaps something else altogether different? Could it mean that not only the patent rights should be waived but that the entire production know-how should be disclosed?

Hoerr: Yes, probably. But you can't force a company to simply disclose all of the knowledge that has been painstakingly acquired over decades. That would have fatal consequences for all of science and medicine: Who would invest in researching new drugs and therapies in the future when all the knowledge has to be given away anyway? 

A completely different problem is that the USA is currently holding back raw materials that we urgently need for vaccine production, which, with reference to the national emergency, are not allowed to be exported.

Q: Are you saying that the fact that the Curevac vaccine is not yet on the market has to do with the lack of supplies from the United States?

Hoerr: No. The vaccines for the ongoing trials - the prerequisites for approval - have already been produced. But producing hundreds of millions more doses of vaccine is a big challenge.

Q: What exactly are we talking about here?

Hoerr: Among other things, there is a lack of chemicals without which it is impossible to produce RNA. Many raw materials come from the USA.

Q: Can the problem be resolved before the Curevac vaccine is approved?

Hoerr: I hope so. The German government and the EU Commission are apparently involved, as far as I have heard. I hope that this can be resolved politically.

Q: The intention to help the whole world was a guideline of Curevac, also in the interests of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is involved in Curevac. Isn't that a contradiction if the knowledge is not passed on?

Hoerr: On the one hand, Curevac passes on the knowledge, not indiscriminately, but specifically to qualified cooperation partners. On the other hand, Curevac is developing a vaccine that requires an extremely low dose. This also keeps the production costs and ultimately the price for the individual shots down. This also benefits people in poor countries. The problem is availability. How are you supposed to vaccinate the world this year when the supply chain is disrupted because national interests are being pursued? That is my main criticism.

&gt;The analysis, carried out between 5 April and 16 May, found the Pfizer vaccine was 88% effective against symptomatic disease from the India variant two weeks after a second dose, compared with 93% effectiveness against the Kent strain. For its part, the AstraZeneca jab was 60% effective, compared with 66% against the Kent variant over the same period.

In the 16 months since COVID-19 really started spreading in China, the Pfizer vaccine has gone from a 93% efficacy against the initial strain to an 88% efficacy against the mutations. You're grossly overstating the risk of variants.

The Blackfeet Tribe, 150 kilometres south of Lethbridge, began offering shots of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna at the Carway border crossing a month ago. Initially it was being offered to members of the Blackfoot Confederacy, but it was later opened up to anyone who wanted it.  
  
The proposal received approval from the tribal administration and both the Canadian and United States governments to set up the mobile clinic on the U.S. side of the border.  
  
Canadians who attended the clinic were given exemptions from having to quarantine for 14 days. They lined up in their cars, drove through a loop, received their shots through the window, were monitored for 15 minutes and went home.  
  
But an official with the Blackfeet Tribe in Browning, Mont., told The Canadian Press late Saturday that the clinics have come to an end.  
  
‚ÄúI am very sad and disappointed to report that we are not to able to continue our border vaccine clinics because of government bureaucracy on both sides. Apparently crossing the border to receive a vaccine is non-essential. Go figure,‚Äù said James McNeely.  
  
U.S. Customs and Border Protection said last week Canadians attempting to drive across the American border solely for a COVID-19 vaccination, even with a doctor‚Äôs referral, would be denied entry.  
  
The Public Health Agency of Canada also clarified that any Canadians travelling to the United States for the purpose of getting the vaccine are not exempted from a 14 day quarantine on their return and that vaccines are now ‚Äúwidely available‚Äù here.  
  
McNeely said 1,350 doses were given in three clinics the tribe held in the past month. Another clinic this week to give people their second shots has now been cancelled.  
  
‚ÄúThis was such an excellent program and it is saving human lives. Isn‚Äôt that what it‚Äôs all about? We‚Äôve had an over abundance of vaccinates and as our health director said it would be a sin to waste vaccines,‚Äù McNeely said.  
  
‚ÄúThis was becoming an international trend along the northern states to help get folks vaccinated. I implore our governments to reconsider the border vaccine clinics across the northern U.S. in order to help saving lives and vaccinating our Canadian neighbours,‚Äù he added.  
  
The popularity of the Alberta border clinics led to lineups up to two kilometres long.

Certain narratives emerged early in the pandemic that stuck and haven't been reassessed or updated. I recall vividly the debates in March 2020, it was an awful month. I live in Sweden and the media narrative that we were on the path to disaster, that we were an open air experiment was omnipresent. But the thing is there was incredible amounts of uncertainty. I remember reading with horror model that predicted 96.000 people would die in Sweden by June 2020 with the current restrictions [\[1\]](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20062133v1). This turned out to be wrong, they overestimated the deaths by about 17 times. 

There were many statements that were made in June about how we could beat COVID, from testing and tracing to everyone wearing N95 masks. The thing is that many countries implemented this and still had a much worse second wave than the first wave. It is like we forgot that natural disasters like this occur, that depending on the preparedness, and the general profile of a society, full suppression was never possible after March 15th. I feel like the actual room to maneuver and push down the virus is smaller than we as humans actually like to admit, but people still speak with certainty ""if we did xyz then we could have 'beat' this thing"". The discourse online and in the media, which many public health officials participated in, encouraged a type of thinking where we could predict what would happen. Those predictions sort of became the narrative. Even though the virus started rapidly spreading in October it was still seen as Thanksgiving surge. Scandalous photos of people in celebrating fourth of July lead to predictions of overflowing hospitals, when they didn't materialize nothing was followed up on. [The lifting of mask mandates had a similar narrative, and when it didn't pan out, nobody went back and corrected the narrative.](https://twitter.com/youyanggu/status/1392179091839848448) The problem is that these predictions when wrong and without communicating the uncertainty decreases peoples trust in institutions.  Instead of saying 'we don't know what will happen but we think this will help' people said 'if we do this we can end this' even though it was unknown if it was achievable. 

I just wish people had more humility. There is so much we don't know and still don't know and I think some people are engaging in motivated reasoning to fit what actually happened to their priors developed in March 2020.

pregnancies were reported through the data cut-off date of November 14, 2020 (12 vaccine, 11
placebo). Study vaccination occurred prior to the last menstrual period (LMP) in 5 participants (4
vaccine, 2 placebo), within 30 days after LMP in 8 participants (4 vaccine, 6 placebo), &gt;30 days
after LMP in 1 participant (0 vaccine, 2 placebo), and date of LMP not known in 5 participants (4
vaccine, 1 placebo). Unsolicited AEs related to pregnancy include spontaneous abortion and
retained products of conception, both in the placebo group. Pregnancy outcomes are otherwise unknown.

And this is what the [FDA document for the J&amp;J vaccine](https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download) says (page 52):

&gt; Study participants of childbearing potential were screened for pregnancy prior to vaccination.
Participants were excluded if they were pregnant or planned to become pregnant within 3
months of vaccine administration. The study is collecting outcomes for all reported pregnancies
in study participants.
Eight pregnancies were reported through January 22, 2021 (4 vaccine, 4 placebo). In 7
participants (3 vaccine, 4 placebo) vaccination was within 30 days after last menstrual period
(LMP) and in 1 vaccine recipient vaccination was prior to LMP. Unsolicited AEs related to
pregnancy include spontaneous abortion (1 vaccine, 0 placebo), incomplete abortion (0 vaccine,
1 placebo), elective abortion (0 vaccine, 2 placebo) and ectopic pregnancy (1 vaccine, 0
placebo). Among participants in the vaccine group, two pregnancies are ongoing with outcomes
unknown at this time.

&gt; A combined developmental and perinatal/postnatal reproductive toxicity study of Ad26.COV2.S
in rabbits was submitted to FDA on January 19, 2021. FDA review of this study concluded that
Ad26.COV.S given prior to mating and during gestation periods at dose of 1x1011 vp (2 times
the human dose) did not have any adverse effects on female reproduction, fetal/embryonal
development, or postnatal development.

It seems no adverse events were reported in the Pfizer or Moderna trials for the vaccinated group, and it seems only two adverse events occurred within the J&amp;J group. I found an article that looks at the available data from several safety surveillance systems in the US, to see if there are any complications occurring within vaccinated pregnant women, and it seems they did not see any obvious safety concerns occurring with the mRNA vaccines.

From the [article](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983) summary:

&gt; Although not directly comparable, calculated proportions of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in persons vaccinated against Covid-19 who had a completed pregnancy were similar to incidences reported in studies involving pregnant women that were conducted before the Covid-19 pandemic.

Take off your nationalist hat. That contract with between AZ and the EU. It isn't the UK's fault that the EU signed months after AZ were already committed to making vaccines for the UK, and that the EU didn't (and still doesn't) understand ""best efforts"". Sorry, that is all on the EU. The UK were not part of the EU/AZ contract (wrong again, aren't you getting bored of being wrong about everything?). The individual nations should have done their own contracts for vaccines perhaps? In fact, it sounds like some did.

But the height of absolute stupidity was that because the EU screwed up their contract with AZ, they were threatening to block pfizer/bion exports (a different company from AZ) to the UK (who were not involved in the AZ-EU contract). I mean, just think about how stupid that actually is. The most farcical thing I have seen for a long time.

Then if 80% of the adult population is vaccinated, then 75%*80%=60% of the population vaccinated, and 90% of those - 54% of the general population - will be resistant from vaccination.  And, of the 40% un-vaccinated population, a quarter - 10% of the general population - will be resistant from recovering.

Vaccines that have arrived at local vaccination sites are wasted if they go unused. 

The debate the researcher is trying to encourage is over policy level decisions. Even with the newer variants, children are notably less likely to contract or transmit COVID. By virtue of their age, they are starting off with an immune response equivalent to that of an adult who has been given a hypothetical, moderately effective vaccine. Given that, it‚Äôs reasonable to argue that, while the vaccine would further reduce the risk to children, their risk is already low enough (especially if most of the adults around them are vaccinated) that we can safely redirect vaccines to high risk populations abroad without throwing our children under the bus.

This paper says that fully vaccinated people are 94% less likely to be hospitalised by covid. This is about a 20x reduction (which is still great).

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html

This source shows that the hospitalisation risk of the elderly (all unvaccinated) is about 10-15x higher than 18-29 year olds. The fatality rate is a few hundred x higher.

So in that case, I was wrong, a vaccinated elderly person has a lower hospitalisation rate than an unvaccinated young adult. You can see that the difference isn't extreme though, plus if you include deaths it gets more extreme

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00947-8/fulltext

This paper lists the effectiveness (Table 2) of the pfizer vaccine at reducing infection, hospitalisation and death, by age. The TLDR is all the numbers are 90something% effective at all ages for infection,hospitalisation and death reduction.

The simple answer is the vaccines DO NOT make you invincible and based on the numbers, bring the average 75+ year old's risk to approximately that of a mid 20's unvaccinated adult. This is my logic for why elderly vaccinated people shouldn't be let loose while unvaccinated people (who haven't even been given the opportunity to be vaccinated) aren't allowed the same freedoms.",,,1621885294,{},gzb4u87,False,t3_njleh3,False,True,t1_gz9r6ob,/r/Coronavirus/comments/njleh3/uk_sees_just_15_covid19_cases_from_events/gzb4u87/,1621965767,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,
[],,wk_end,,,[],,,,text,t2_iceb7,False,False,[],"I know the research you‚Äôre talking about, and there are two things at play here.

The first is that, as a sibling comment mentions, it could be totally natural and still have been brought to Wuhan by coronavirus researchers there and then leaked from their lab. Researchers at the WIV in particular were going to bat caves in southern China and hunting for coronavirus samples there, and indeed that‚Äôs where the closest known natural relative to SARS-CoV-2 came from.

The other is that...well, that research *wasn‚Äôt very good*. It basically presumed one particular way the virus could‚Äôve been constructed if it were non-natural and argued that because there were no signs of that particular method, the virus must be natural. But this doesn‚Äôt account for things like ‚Äúno-see-um‚Äù techniques to undetectably alter viruses, or gain-of-function through serial passage, which is wholly natural - just guided evolution in action.

There‚Äôs an article about all this in The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists that covers all this and more that‚Äôs worth seeking out, but here are the money quotes:

&gt; True, some older methods of cutting and pasting viral genomes retain tell-tale signs of manipulation. But newer methods, called ‚Äúno-see-um‚Äù or ‚Äúseamless‚Äù approaches, leave no defining marks. Nor do other methods for manipulating viruses such as serial passage, the repeated transfer of viruses from one culture of cells to another. If a virus has been manipulated, whether with a seamless method or by serial passage, there is no way of knowing that this is the case.

[...]

&gt; First, they say that the spike protein of SARS2 binds very well to its target, the human ACE2 receptor, but does so in a different way from that which physical calculations suggest would be the best fit. Therefore the virus must have arisen by natural selection, not manipulation.

&gt; If this argument seems hard to grasp, it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs so strained. The authors‚Äô basic assumption, not spelt out, is that anyone trying to make a bat virus bind to human cells could do so in only one way. First they would calculate the strongest possible fit between the human ACE2 receptor and the spike protein with which the virus latches onto it. They would then design the spike protein accordingly (by selecting the right string of amino acid units that compose it). Since the SARS2 spike protein is not of this calculated best design, the Andersen paper says, therefore it can‚Äôt have been manipulated.

&gt; But this ignores the way that virologists do in fact get spike proteins to bind to chosen targets, which is not by calculation but by splicing in spike protein genes from other viruses or by serial passage. With serial passage, each time the virus‚Äôs progeny are transferred to new cell cultures or animals, the more successful are selected until one emerges that makes a really tight bind to human cells. Natural selection has done all the heavy lifting. The Andersen paper‚Äôs speculation about designing a viral spike protein through calculation has no bearing on whether or not the virus was manipulated by one of the other two methods.

&gt; The authors‚Äô second argument against manipulation is even more contrived. Although most living things use DNA as their hereditary material, a number of viruses use RNA, DNA‚Äôs close chemical cousin. But RNA is difficult to manipulate, so researchers working on coronaviruses, which are RNA-based, will first convert the RNA genome to DNA. They manipulate the DNA version, whether by adding or altering genes, and then arrange for the manipulated DNA genome to be converted back into infectious RNA.

&gt; Only a certain number of these DNA backbones have been described in the scientific literature. Anyone manipulating the SARS2 virus ‚Äúwould probably‚Äù have used one of these known backbones, the Andersen group writes, and since SARS2 is not derived from any of them, therefore it was not manipulated. But the argument is conspicuously inconclusive. DNA backbones are quite easy to make, so it‚Äôs obviously possible that SARS2 was manipulated using an unpublished DNA backbone.

 &gt; And that‚Äôs it. These are the two arguments made by the Andersen group in support of their declaration that the SARS2 virus was clearly not manipulated. And this conclusion, grounded in nothing but two inconclusive speculations, convinced the world‚Äôs press that SARS2 could not have escaped from a lab.",,,1621885289,{},gzb4tvo,False,t3_nk3vlk,False,False,t1_gzawc5j,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nk3vlk/dr_fauci_says_hes_not_convinced_covid19_developed/gzb4tvo/,1621965761,15,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

‚Äú Barring that, if we want to talk about the morality of vaccinating all elderly and at-risk globally first, then let‚Äôs consider all of those at less risk (including low risk people in their 20s, 30s, even 40s possibly) waiting.

No first world country is going to delay vaccinating just their kids when it‚Äôs known to be safe to vaccinate them.

The time to have this discussion was before we started vaccinating low risk adults of all ages.

Or really, before any vaccines were finalized and sold.

Edit: vaccinating the elderly and high risk in (largely high density) poorer areas won‚Äôt reduce the chance of mutations. They aren‚Äôt the ones contributing to the spread much. Plus you could vaccinate everyone 45+ in India and that would still only be ~ 17% of the population vaccinated.

The Post adjusted covid-19 rates for cases, deaths and hospitalization over time by combining Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data on cases, hospitalization and vaccinations. The Post used a rolling seven-day average of daily cases, deaths and hospitalization. For vaccination, The Post used the number of people who had received at least one shot as of each date.  
For events like covid-19 infection, rates are usually calculated by dividing the number of cases by the number of people in the population. For example, if there are 12 cases among a population of 100 people, the rate would be 12 people per 100. The Post reduced the denominator to exclude most vaccinated people. So if 20 people got vaccinated, that would mean there were 12 cases out of the remaining 80 unvaccinated people, for an adjusted rate of 15 cases per 100 people.  
Vaccination is not perfect in preventing infections, however, so The Post did not subtract the entire population of vaccinated people. Data shows vaccines are about 90 percent effective in preventing cases among people who have received the shot. Cases among vaccinated people are called breakthrough cases. To be conservative, The Post estimated that up to 15 percent of the vaccinated population could still be infected.  
So, in the example above, instead of removing all 20 vaccinated people, The Post removed 17. That would leave 12 cases among 83 people, for an adjusted rate of 14.5 cases per 100 people.

&gt;removing the mask mandate prematurely (not even attempting to do his national mask mandate he campaigned on), desperately trying to push a return to normalcy

States were always in control of shut downs and most mask mandates (Trump never ordered states to shut down), so you can't blame Biden on the lack or presence of shut downs. You can try to blame him for not trying to convince states to shut down more or for not putting a federally mandated mask law, but you're missing a critical piece of the puzzle: vaccines. Vaccines only began to be distributed at the very end of Trump's term so they basically didn't exist. You can't compare one person wanting normal with no real way to stop the spread of the virus versus having a vaccine that has already been given to the most at risk (elderly, pre-existing conditions, medical field, etc) so even if people get infected, deaths and hospitalizations are way down. That's a big deal. 

&gt;ramping up the anti China manufactured virus allegations

Here we demonstrate that in patients who experienced mild infections (n=77), serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibodies decline rapidly in the first 4&amp;nbsp;months after infection and then more gradually over the following 7&amp;nbsp;months, remaining detectable at least 11&amp;nbsp;months after infection.

We demonstrate that S-binding BMPCs are quiescent, indicating that they are part of a long-lived compartment.

Why propose a waiver of IP rights, which is very controversial, while throttling the global supply chain for vaccine materials, which makes it hard for non-US producers to make vaccines? 

There is no evidence to show that Pfizer or Moderna will be starved of supplies if the US were to allow exports. Both Moderna and Pfizer have their existing supply chain established which won't be affected. Continuing the DPA now amounts to starving the world of vaccines in order to give US companies a competitive advantage.

If CureVac doesn't start vaccine production now, it won't be able to supply vaccines when it is approved in June. As I understand it, CureVac has been producing a few million doses but needs more supplies to ramp up production. They wouldn't do that if they thought they wouldn't get approved. 

The first vaccine isn't necessarily the best vaccine. There is no reason to limit the supply to two mRNA vaccine makers. It's only by enlarging the field that competition will drive down the price and improve the product.

We will *not* be back at square 1. The spike protein can only change so much for the virus to behave in the way that it does, and the vaccines target that protein.  So, in all likelihood, when new variants emerge, if they stymie the vaccine, it will be a gradual thing, where the efficacy is reduced, but not to zero.  This is what we have seen so far.  The idea that a new variant is going to pop up, and be so different as to reduce the efficacy of all of our vaccines to zero, is hyperbolic and absolutely not grounded in science.

Additionally, we are now really good at designing, producing, and distributing mRNA vaccines.  The FDA has said that they will follow an expedited approval process for boosters for variants, and the US has shown the capability to distribute 4-5 million doses per day.  That means that we could distribute boosters to all who want/need them over 1-2 months.  Very doable.

I think that this is just more disingenuous framing. In reality, there is a difference between ""medical advice"" and ""actionable public policy."" Most people that I see taking issue with the CDC *aren't* disagreeing with the medical science or medical expertise of the CDC. Instead, they are raising issues related to how best to apply the known medical science to create rational public policy.

Now, obviously, if people are saying that they know more *strictly from the standpoint of demonstrable medical science than the CDC,* then they should be dismissed *regardless* of how smart they are if they can't back up there claims with scientific facts and evidence.

That has nothing to do with the CDC or their expertise though. That's just basic science. The best evidence should carry the day, regardless of how ""smart"" the person is that is presenting the evidence. Better evidence shouldn't be dismissed just because you don't like/respect the credentials of the person that showed it to you.

&gt;The CDC has more Covid research than anyone else on the planet.

As to your last paragraph, you still don‚Äôt get it - the arguments weren‚Äôt about if lockdowns in isolation sucked outright for everyone - I‚Äôd argue that many of the older more asset rich are actually going to outright benefit from lockdowns, but most people across age groups felt some standalone pain - the argument was about the benefits of avoiding wider covid spread versus the cost of lockdowns by group. Broadly speaking my position is that older people did net benefit, wildly so. Younger people generally did not. Hence younger people broadly  personally sacrificed to lock down (negative net personal benefit, aka covid risk low, lockdown cost huge) to benefit the old (positive net benefit, aka covid risk high, lockdown cost lower). Maybe that is fine, a generation or two took one for the team and I haven‚Äôt really assigned a value judgment to it, but it remains the case.

What's the scenario here though?  A mad scientist goes off the rails and releases the virus to the public, against the knowledge and consent of the Chinese government?  If so then that person or the group of people involved would be criminals and that would be the end of it.

On the other hand, it seems less plausible that China would intentionally release a virus in their own country that would kill or harm a lot of their own people, which would later spread globally and result in the global economy suffering and China losing out on a lot of business.  The worst scenario against China seems extremely implausible in this case.  You stated the goal could have been this:

&gt; If this was released intentionally, they now know how to do it and make it work while being able to keep their population relatively secure.

I could come up with a more intelligent scenario for them to do this kind of unethical ""test"".  Don't forget that China has done a lot of work with poor countries by building them roads, putting factories in, etc.  Among this is medical facilities as well.  So if I were China and wanting to act evil, I could do such a test in some third world nation that I have some level of control in.  Even better would be if it were a remote island nation that would be more easily cut off from the world.  That way you never risk your own people.

WASHINGTON‚ÄîThree researchers from China‚Äôs Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick enough in November 2019 that they sought hospital care, according to a previously undisclosed U.S. intelligence report that could add weight to growing calls for a fuller probe of whether the Covid-19 virus may have escaped from the laboratory.
The details of the reporting go beyond a State Department fact sheet, issued during the final days of the Trump administration, which said that several researchers at the lab, a center for the study of coronaviruses and other pathogens, became sick in autumn 2019 ‚Äúwith symptoms consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illness.‚Äù


The disclosure of the number of researchers, the timing of their illnesses and their hospital visits come on the eve of a meeting of the World Health Organization‚Äôs decision-making body, which is expected to discuss the next phase of an investigation into Covid-19‚Äôs origins.
Current and former officials familiar with the intelligence about the lab researchers expressed differing views about the strength of the supporting evidence for the assessment. One person said that it was provided by an international partner and was potentially significant but still in need of further investigation and additional corroboration.


Another person described the intelligence as stronger. ‚ÄúThe information that we had coming from the various sources was of exquisite quality. It was very precise. What it didn‚Äôt tell you was exactly why they got sick,‚Äù he said, referring to the researchers.


November 2019 is roughly when many epidemiologists and virologists believe SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the pandemic, first began circulating around the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where Beijing says that the first confirmed case was a man who fell ill on Dec. 8, 2019.
The Wuhan Institute hasn‚Äôt shared raw data, safety logs and lab records on its extensive work with coronaviruses in bats, which many consider the most likely source of the virus.


China has repeatedly denied that the virus escaped from one of its labs. On Sunday, China‚Äôs foreign ministry cited a WHO-led team‚Äôs conclusion, after a visit to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, or WIV, in February, that a lab leak was extremely unlikely. ‚ÄúThe U.S. continues to hype the lab leak theory,‚Äù the foreign ministry said in response to a request for comment by The Wall Street Journal. ‚ÄúIs it actually concerned about tracing the source or trying to divert attention?‚Äù
The Biden administration declined to comment on the intelligence but said that all technically credible theories on the origin of the pandemic should be investigated by the WHO and international experts.


‚ÄúWe continue to have serious questions about the earliest days of the Covid-19 pandemic, including its origins within the People‚Äôs Republic of China,‚Äù said a spokeswoman for the National Security Council.


‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to make pronouncements that prejudge an ongoing WHO study into the source of SARS-CoV-2,‚Äù the spokeswoman said. ‚ÄúAs a matter of policy we never comment on intelligence issues.‚Äù


Beijing has also asserted that the virus could have originated outside China, including at a lab at the Fort Detrick military base in Maryland, and called for the WHO to investigate early Covid outbreaks in other countries.


Most scientists say they have seen nothing to corroborate the idea that the virus came from a U.S. military lab, and the White House has said there are no credible reasons to investigate it.
China‚Äôs National Health Commission and the WIV didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment. Shi Zhengli, the top bat coronavirus expert at WIV, has said the virus didn‚Äôt leak from her laboratories. She told the WHO-led team that traveled to Wuhan earlier this year to investigate the origins of the virus that all staff had tested negative for Covid-19 antibodies and there had been no turnover of staff on the coronavirus team.


Marion Koopmans, a Dutch virologist on that team told NBC News in March that some WIV staff did fall sick in the autumn of 2019, but she attributed that to regular, seasonal sickness.
‚ÄúThere were occasional illnesses because that‚Äôs normal. There was nothing that stood out,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMaybe one or two. It‚Äôs certainly not a big, big thing.‚Äù


It isn‚Äôt unusual for people in China to go straight to the hospital when they fall sick, either because they get better care there or lack access to a general practitioner. Covid-19 and the flu, while very different illnesses, share some of the same symptoms, such as fever, aches and a cough. Still, it could be significant if members of the same team working with coronaviruses went to hospital with similar symptoms shortly before the pandemic was first identified.


David Asher, a former U.S. official who led a State Department task force on the origins of the virus for then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, told a Hudson Institute seminar in March that he doubted that the lab researchers became sick because of the ordinary flu.


‚ÄúI‚Äôm very doubtful that three people in highly protected circumstances in a level three laboratory working on coronaviruses would all get sick with influenza that put them in the hospital or in severe conditions all in the same week, and it didn‚Äôt have anything to do with the coronavirus,‚Äù he said, adding that the researchers‚Äô illness may represent ‚Äúthe first known cluster‚Äù of Covid-19 cases.


Long characterized by skeptics as a conspiracy theory, the hypothesis that the pandemic could have begun with a lab accident has attracted more interest from scientists who have complained about the lack of transparency by Chinese authorities or conclusive proof for the alternate hypothesis: that the virus was contracted by humans from a bat or other infected animal outside a lab.


Many proponents of the lab hypothesis say that a virus that was carried by an infected bat might have been brought to the lab so that researchers could work on potential vaccines‚Äîonly to escape.


While the lab hypothesis is being taken more seriously, including by Biden administration officials, the debate is still colored by political tensions, including over how much evidence is needed to sustain the hypothesis.


The State Department fact sheet issued during the Trump administration, which drew on classified intelligence, said that the ‚ÄúU.S. government has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both Covid-19 and seasonal illnesses.‚Äù


The Jan. 15 fact sheet added that this fact ‚Äúraises questions about the credibility‚Äù of Dr. Shi and criticized Beijing for its ‚Äúdeceit and disinformation‚Äù while acknowledging that the U.S. government hasn‚Äôt determined exactly how the pandemic began.


The Biden administration hasn‚Äôt disputed any of the assertions in the fact sheet, which current and former officials say was vetted by U.S. intelligence agencies. The fact sheet also covered research activities at the WIV, its alleged cooperation on some projects with the Chinese military and accidents at other Chinese labs.


But one Biden administration official said that by highlighting data that pointed to the lab leak hypothesis, Trump administration officials had sought ‚Äúto put spin on the ball.‚Äù Several U.S. officials described the intelligence as ‚Äúcircumstantial,‚Äù worthy of further exploration but not conclusive on its own.


Asked about the Jan. 15 statement, State Department spokesman Ned Price said: ‚ÄúA fact sheet issued by the previous administration on January 15 did not draw any conclusions regarding the origins of the coronavirus. Rather, it focused on the lack of transparency surrounding the origins.‚Äù
Though the first known case was Dec. 8, several analyses of the virus‚Äôs rate of mutation concluded that it likely began spreading several weeks earlier.


The WHO-led team that visited Wuhan concluded in a joint report with Chinese experts in March that the virus most likely spread from bats to humans via another animal, and that a laboratory leak was ‚Äúextremely unlikely.‚Äù


However, team members said they didn‚Äôt view raw data or original lab, safety and other records. On the same day the report came out, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the team hadn‚Äôt adequately examined the lab leak hypothesis, and called for a fuller probe of the idea.
The U.S., European Union and several other governments have also called for a more transparent investigation of Covid-19‚Äôs origins, without explicitly demanding a lab probe. They have called in particular for better access to data and samples from potential early Covid-19 cases.


Members of the WHO-led team said Chinese counterparts had identified 92 potential Covid-19 cases among some 76,000 people who fell sick between October and early December 2019, but turned down requests to share raw data on the larger group. That data would help the WHO-led team understand why China sought to only test those 92 people for antibodies.


Team members also said they asked for access to a Wuhan blood bank to test samples from before December 2019 for antibodies. Chinese authorities declined at first, citing privacy concerns, then agreed, but have yet to provide that access, team members say.",,,1621884524,{},gzb346p,False,t3_njflft,False,True,t3_njflft,/r/Coronavirus/comments/njflft/intelligence_on_sick_staff_at_wuhan_lab_fuels/gzb346p/,1621964695,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
