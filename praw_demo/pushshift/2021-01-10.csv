I certainly agree that the trend lines are all the same - that's my point.  The trend lines are all the same despite differences in changes in mobility.

Again, no idea how you can look at those and conclude what you're concluding.  If an 18% decrease in mobility over baseline is sufficient to trigger the collapse in cases we've seen in North Dakota (80% decrease in 6 weeks), why did the states in your graph that had greater than 18% decreases in the mobility all summer/fall see massive spikes?  It just doesn't foot.  If an 18% change in mobility is sufficient to reduce R0 far enough below 1 to trigger these kinds of reductions, a state that averaged a 25% reduction in mobility over the summer should never have seen a surge.

That's not what I said. (Speaking of forcing data to fit a narrative....) I said that they weren't necessarily a ""drain"" on the economy.

As my own relatives have gotten older and I've become involved in some different hobbies, I've been hanging around a lot more people in the 65+ age group and have been paying more attention to them. It was a real eye-opener to see how many of them still worked (even if part-time) and how much they spent on their hobbies. For example, when I started going on birding field trips, I couldn't help but notice that the people who'd spent thousands of dollars on spotting scopes and long-distance birding trips tended to be retired. Also found out that a surprising number of old people ski on weekdays; I took some lessons from ladies who were in their 70s.

It is not 'BS'.. The data is right there in the peer-reviewed p3 trial. It's public and accessible. The first dose of pfizer confers ~90% protection when measured using like-for-like efficacy metric.  The primary reason of second dose in prime boost regimen is generating more durable, longer lasting immunity. It's important but the first dose always does the heavy lifting. 

You probably heard some story about 52% protection right? That stems from mainstream media who don't understand how the primary efficacy endpoint was calculated and go on to communicate that concretely to the public.   For pfizer the final efficacy number that found 95% is that's calculated by looking at PCR confirmed symptomatic cases anytime after 7 days after dose 2. Any infection that occured in the past 28 days from the point of dose 1 is ignored. 

Whereas that 52% number counts every infection from the point of dose 1. The data on cumulative incidence and antibody titre clearly shows the vaccine does not kick in till 12 days. It doesn't deviate from placebo. 
That's why the 52% figure sounds artificiailly low and the 95% is artificiailly high, because they're measured with separate metrics and most infections occur in the first date. 

The data is right there for Moderna too. See the trial. See the FDA briefing. The data shows ~92% one dose.

That's just one reason various governments have gone with the decision to give second dose more than 21 days apart (21 days, by the way was chosen because it was the minimum time pfizer could use for the trial given the urgency time constraints and NOT because it's an optimal dose interval) because it works ok
CDC/AICP usually set 4 week delay minimum between any vaccine in US 
 some places aren't going to tweak it. Other countries have more pressing issues with supply constraints and rising cases. 

Also not everyone in the pfizer trial even got their second dose within the 21 day planned window.. some got theirs (not by design) up to six weeks later.. that's why denmark, WHO says six week delay is fine.

I never made such an assumption, and I never claimed that their climate played a significant role for them. I asked how anyone could know that it didn't? 

My entire point of my post was that there are so many variables that goes into the success or failure of each country that it's impossible to say for sure that country X succeeded because of reason Y. And this leads to a situation where everyone just interprets the data to confirm the beliefs they already hold.

&gt; Haidt rejects rational thinking entirely. Indeed, he goes so far as to label those who engage in systematic rational thinking as ""autistic"" (pg 136). He labels modern, civilized countries as WEIRD (an insulting acronym he made up). He also has no interest in individual rights, such as America's Bill of Rights. Rather, he finds solace in the ignorance of impoverished villagers in northeast Brazil and primitive people of India who wipe their butts with their hands (really! see pg 122). He praises studies which show that ignorant people prefer collectivism and use their intuitions (prejudices/biases) when making moral decisions. Critical thinking? Rights? To Haidt, they're irrelevant. He's openly hostile to critical thinking.

Modern prostitution and sex slavery operates in a world that sane people can’t comprehend or stomach. In my career I’ve come across cases that have elicited physical illness from veteran law enforcement—some hardened detectives have killed themselves over things they’ve uncovered.

I can understand the desire and basic argument for legalization.

Given these statistics, I believe shielding should be prioritized for those at risk, whether due to age and/or underlying conditions, while allowing the rest of the population to live normally.

I mentioned what the root of the problem is and provided a potential solution. You mentioned the outcome of the problem and suggested a way to alleviate the outcomes cascading from that problem so you’re not offering anything of substance to begin with.

&gt; We need people to do work

That’s an understandable but ultimately meaningless point of view without contextualizing it and defining work or value or if you consider “endless growth” to be the ultimate object.

We need a happy and healthy society to function within the confines of what the economic structures allow and demand. One of the many components is work, however what many have termed work and demand of the workers is changing at a fast pace, and those changes demand a new economic and political system. The changes that are central and most powerful, in the face of the lumbering giant of automation, is democratic socialism and universal basic income.

&gt; If you pay them to not work, then they won't work, because the incentive is gone.

That hasn’t proven to be true in studies with UBI. In fact people tend to be happy and healthier and begin seeking alternatives to the types of work they were shoehorned into prior to the study.

1. Why would you prefer being 0% protected to being 90+% protected for a few weeks, with some unknown level of protection thereafter?

2. If you do refuse, it just means I get a dose (or two) sooner. First doses first is only being considered because demand is vastly in excess of supply.

Firstly, the chance of catching the virus is proportional to the number of people who are currently ill and who can spread the disease. As more people are vaccinated, this group will grow smaller, and you will be less at risk.

Secondly, it is probably not practical to allow people who are already vaccinated more freedom. Trying to distinguish them is not workable. So everybody will have to follow the same rules, vaccinated or not. At least fir a little while.

Mind you, the goal of the vaccinations is  not to protect you from the virus. The goal is to reduce infections so all of us can be safe again. It's a subtle difference but it's important.

New York for example has 3700 POD's (points of dispensing) planned for the state, when they first started about 50 were active and currently about 650 are. So that's a 5-6x increase.

Other states are using stadiums, hotels, and large public spaces to give 1000-2000 shots per day and those are just coming online now.

The constraint currently is vaccine supply for example New York is getting 300k per week.  But there are reports that the federal government has been holding back supply in case there is a manufacturing disruption and Biden intends on reversing that. Also the manufacturing seems to be going well and the pharma companies have been upping their projected numbers.

Roughly 10% 3 weeks later. Roughly 10% 3 weeks earlier So what makes you think we're not near 50% total infected? I'm not following your reasoning.

Again, I'm taking the total number of people that were positive over the entire period of time.  I'm not looking at a single day.  I'm taking all cases that tested positive from midway in August to today and multiplying that by the 3x factor.  The maximum that are positive in a day is 18.5% so I'm applying that to the entire time period.  That works against my lowest possible calculation because if the number is lower (say the 10% rate), then the number of people tested to come out with the positivity rate would be even higher.  So, instead of saying, ""Oh, this is 10% here and 10% there,"" I'm saying, ""For the sake of argument, lets make it the maximum that it possibly could be and say it was 18.5% for the entire period to give the MINIMUM number of people that would need to be tested to come back with that positivity rate.""  

&gt;Also I looked around that site and it says there are 4 ways positivity rates are being calculated and it varies state-to-state. How do you know which way ND's using?

It's not how ND is calculating it.  It's how JHU is calculating it.  Which they state:

""The Coronavirus Resource Center’s current approach to calculating positivity throughout our site is Approach 4, for the following reasons:""  

Approach 4 is ""The number of people who test positive is divided by either **unique** people, encounters, or tests"" 

I really have no idea why so many people have some sort of hang up and want to cling to this belief that ND has reached herd immunity when we know that this virus comes in waves.  ND basically didn't have a first wave and, like the rest of the country, had a very small second wave.  Then they had a third large wave just like the rest of the country is experiencing.  Should we go back to places that had large first waves and retroactively claim that they reached herd immunity even though they didn't?  Because this is essentially the claim that people are trying to make about North Dakota.  

We can just look at the serology testing for North Dakota found here:  https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases

1442 detected out of 13395 total.  That's 10.7%.  Compare that to a place like Manaus Brazil that had 44-66% positive on the serology testing from March to August.  Guess what happened there after a brief period of respite and declining numbers?  That's right...another surge that kicked off mid September.

That would be the Sinovac one, which should explain why not. Political challenges aside, vaccine hesitancy might increase somewhat when the vaccine says ""Wuhan Institute of Virology"" on the label.

There's also Novavax, which if we are lucky, will arrive before the sun collapses into a white dwarf. Their stage 3 trial just got started.

They are also difficult to make because you have to first breed the virus and then kill it just enough so it doesn't replicate but not so much that it becomes unrecognisable. This is not easy to scale up.

Moreover, the swine flu vaccine that caused narcolepsy was an inactivated virus vaccine and that was the reason it caused narcolepsy. If it was an mRNA vaccine, it would be fine. The narcolepsy came with the virus _shell_.

AstraZeneca and Gameleya use vector viruses, which is also a well known method. The crappy performance of the adenovirus based AstraZeneca vaccine points to the problem with this technique: you can easily become immune to the vector and then the vaccine never works for you again, which is a bit of a problem once the virus mutates. Gameleya picked cold viruses as carrier, so better hope you didn't get that particular cold strain before.

During the large wave, North Dakota tested 25% of their population (unique individuals) on average 2 times.  The positivity rate for unique tests never exceeded 18.5%.  That's a maximum.  During the wave period approximately 80,000 people tested positive.  If that number were 7.2x higher, that would be 576,000 cases that were not accounted for.  Given the 18.5% maximum positivity rate, they would need to have a minimum population size of 3.1 million people, exceeding the population of the state by 2.3 million.  Again, this is a minimum and again, 25% of the state was tested on average twice during the wave period.  

Not to mention, the ongoing serology study in North Dakota only shows 10.7% of the state as having antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.  https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases (scroll down to serology testing)  Compare that to Manaus Brazil that had a seroprevalence of 44-66% by September and still experienced another wave of cases and is now at 76% seroprevalence by December.  

In other words, there's no herd immunity here.  It's a mathematical impossibility, isn't supported by serological testing data, and simply defies common sense.  What there was, however, was an 18% decline in mobility as cases rose.  Which over the Christmas/New Years holidays rose back up briefly, which is leading to another spike as seen in North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Montana, etc...every place that underwent the September-December wave period.

Let me explain in terms of an equation:

Chance of getting long term covid complication = (chance of getting covid) x (chance of long term complications from covid)

Chance of getting long term vaccine complication = 100% x (chance of getting long term vaccine complication)

You see how there is two variables to the first equation and only one to second (since chance of getting vaccine if you get vaccinated is 100%) That’s the only point I’m making, that it’s illogical to compare only the two long term risk variables when there are more than one variables involved when calculating covid risk.

&gt;We can make sense of mutations using six distinct categories. The first and most common type is substitution. Where an A should go, for example, a G somehow ends up instead. Unlike most RNA viruses, human coronaviruses come equipped with corrective machinery that can normally fix substitutions. This so-called proofreading mechanism is why SARS-CoV-2 has thus far yielded a rate of error much lower than RNA viruses like HIV and influenza. But what this virus lacks in its capacity for variation, it makes up for in the large number of people it infects—meaning that when a variant does catch on, it can spread like wildfire.



&gt;The second type is deletion. Deletions occur when the polymerase skips, leaving a gap in the genetic code. The nasty thing about deletions is that the virus cannot correct them retroactively. Though more likely to disrupt function than a substitution, and just as capable of killing the virus altogether, some deletions, both small and large, still allow the virus to grow. The mutations of this sort that are most advantageous to the virus—and of most concern to us—alter the virus in significant ways.

&gt;Two kinds of deletions exist—in frame, and out of frame. So long as deletions appear in multiples of three, they remain in frame, unobtrusive to the protein as a whole. However, deletions that occur singly or doubly—out of frame—disrupt the entire protein, not unlike the misplaced letter in a run-on sentence that causes the reader to stop and stumble.

&gt;The third type is insertion, a mutation that has been observed occasionally amongst the hundreds of thousands of genomic sequences stored in GISAID, an open-access sequence repository. Insertions describe the extra bits of genetic information, whether it’s one nucleotide or an entire segment, that end up in a given genome by chance.

&gt;The fourth type is inversion, which happens when a segment of the genome is flipped on its head, reversing the order of its nucleotides.

&gt;When the polymerase stutters and spits out the same bit of information over again, a duplicate is created—hence the fifth type, duplication.

&gt;The sixth and final type is recombination. Literally, parts of two separate viruses become conjoined. When two different viral genomes find themselves in the same cell, their bits and pieces can shuffle from one to the other, unwittingly settling into new forms in the process. The way SARS-CoV-2 produces its proteins encourages recombination. Even a region as crucial as the S protein could be up for grabs.

&gt;The existing literature on coronaviruses already tells us they can recombine, at least in bats. In fact, this process is likely how SARS-CoV-2 came to be born, possibly in the ant-eating mammals known as pangolins. There are unpublished reports that recombination among SARS-CoV-2 variants occurs. In a dense crowd, one person might be infected simultaneously by two different people, or reinfected when subgenomic remnants of their first infection still linger on in their system. SARS-CoV-2 can also infect animals that live closely with us, and as such recombination events combining SARS-CoV-2 with animal genes might also occur, changing the virus in unknown and possibly dangerous ways.

&gt;Given the high prevalence of both SARS-CoV-2 and other cold-causing viruses at this time, I suspect all the events above have either already occurred or inevitably ill. At first glance, none of these mutations, taken in isolation, would appear capable of kickstarting a new variant of disease. Calculated and conceived at scale, however, a more swarming and certainly more startling impression begins to emerge.

&gt;Take substitution. On average, in a viral genome 30,000 units long, substitution alters one unit of every 10,000. We can’t say for sure how many viruses are teeming at any moment within one person infected with Covid-19, but we do know that every milliliter of contagious nasal fluid contains something like 10^8 (one hundred million) to 10^9 (one billion) viral particles.

&gt;One billion viruses, per our one per 10,000 average, means three billion substitutions—and that’s just in one drop of mucus. Multiply that by the actual volume of active virus in a single body, then the number of active Covid-19 infections in a given populace, and before long you’ll find yourself well into the quintillions.

[],,Mageris,,,[],,,,text,t2_4d8dgdwd,False,False,[],"I will get a vaccine when I have all my questions properly answered and when it becomes more readily accessible. I have a lot of questions and confusion on the issue, and no one seems to have any good credible sources of information to help me make my decision. I mean I don't know anything about any of the companies manufacturing it. I don't know the differences between all the ones they're testing and how they work. I don't even know what mRNA is. However, seeing people in the medical field being hesitant is concerning and leaves alot of confusion for people like me. So this is why I am where I am. Read on, if you want to know my personal reasons for where I stand.

 At this time, I am hesitant due to some of the unknowns that others here have mentioned, in addition to simply being decently afraid as I suffer from GAD, anemia, CFS, and seemingly have become more prone to infections within my body towards the end of 2020. (I have had a total of 3 different types in the past 5 months). None that were serious, just alarming at the sudden increase despite not leaving my house or working for half that time period. These infections are gone now except one that I'm currently dealing with. 

As for my fear, it's a bit more to do with my anxiety disorder relating to my other issues and less to do with the unknown. I'm not afraid of needles as I use to be a clinical trial patient for quite a few studies some years ago. However, I struggle to take new medications when recommended, even with a new higher dose, I'll inevitably fall into an anxiety attack which causes me to get angina if I have one long enough. This is concerning as my heart does have a slight arrhythmia and given my long list of family history with many heart health issues especially in my more immediate family, I cannot afford to take any risk lightly. This past September, I ended up nearly having to go to urgent care because my heart would not stop squeezing/spasming irregularly in my chest for a half hour. It did eventually return to normal and while I should've went anyways to get checked out (I'm uninsured), I felt inclined to take a wait and see approach. It has not happened again since that day. 

 During the beginning of the past year, I will admit I was very adamantly against getting it as I simply believed that I was young, in decent enough health, and therefore didn't need to get it. I did not downplay who could get it or that it was just a flu. I simply looked at the numbers and went with the statistics. Same with why I do not get regular flu shots and haven't for the last 14 years. I'm not opposed to people getting it or am Anti-Vax in any way, I simply want to know all I can before diving into putting a substance in my body given all I've listed above. 

  And yes, maybe even a bit of paranoia is at play because I do not believe the media is always honest with the general public. I'm never gonna change my mind on that. I can be honest about my feelings without fear-mongering or using pseudo-science to ""prove my point"". In addition to moderate distrust to most of the higher end of the pharmaceutical industry and the American government with its own shady dealings, which I still have, even now but I'm taking time to think about it as more accurate information is available to me. After my mom got sick (her covid test was inconclusive) and her ending up in the ER, it's made me reconsider my stance and I'm now looking into more information to make a better informed decision to get a vaccine in time. Just not sure which is the best option when they're accessible to everyone.

I'm a big fan of learning about behavioural economics and how human decision making (driven by our personalities and experiences) is irrational, not rational as is believed in traditional economics.

Behaviour is fascinating and our brains work the way they do because generally it was advantageous to think that way once upon a time.

So when I am presented with a different opinion to mine, I try to determine the truth. I care less about being right than I do about knowing the truth.

My opinions will ultimately drive my children through their experiences, so I think it's important to know what is true.

In 1947, NYC started a mass vaccination program overnight and got over 6 million people vaccinated in 3 weeks.

Over 70 years later, NYC started vaccinating people after multiple months of notice. They got 520k doses delivered to the city, and in three weeks have vaccinated 200k.

What is it that stops them from using at least half their doses today exactly? Have we forgotten how to vaccinate people since the mid-century, to the point that we can vaccinate 10 times less people? Because if you can't provide any reason, your glib dismissal of this example is itself to be dismissed.

They've *already spent* $12.6~15.84 *billion* USD, and are projected to spend as much as twice that to actually hold the event. Talk about [sunk investments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect).

On the one hand, it sounds almost as likely that hosting the event will break the bank, but the plan is to recoup those losses (as much as possible) through ticket sales, sponsorship deals etc. I don't think they ever planned to make a *profit* off the games, but to host them at a minimal loss.

I think they are also holding on to a nostalgia for the 1964 Olympics, which led to direct investment in Tokyo's infrastructure and was followed by an economic boom: the government believes it can revive that magic.

Note: My point is not to defend holding the games to prop up the economy as actually a good idea, but to illustrate the thinking most everyone I've spoken to about it in Japan uses to justify holding the games to prop up the economy.",,,1610338624,{},giu8weg,False,t3_kuftn8,False,True,t1_giu2w2e,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kuftn8/80_of_people_in_japan_want_olympics_cancelled_or/giu8weg/,1610387951,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There are more benefits if you join as a member but they also have a message board called [Widowed Village](https://soaringspirits.org/programs/widowed-village/) which is free, but you have to sign up because they will screen to make sure that only verified widows join so they are protected from potential scammers. There are a lot of specific message boards you can sign up for depending on how old you are, if you have kids, lgbtq couples, your religious affiliation, etc. There is a lot of raw grief there but you will definitely not feel alone.

The [Modern Widows Club](https://modernwidowsclub.com/) is specifically for women and offers regional chapters (currently meeting over Zoom), Facebook, Youtube, and a podcast called Healthy Widow Healthy Woman.

[Sunny Care Services](https://sunnycareservices.com/) has some helpful free checklists they can email you, such as their After Loss Checklist. You can also pay them to help you do some of these things if you're overwhelmed.

It might take some time before you can consider reading some “grief” books, but Megan Devine’s **It’s OK That You’re Not OK** really understands all the emotions involved. If you prefer more of a research-based approach, [The Other Side of Sadness](https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/george-a-bonanno/the-other-side-of-sadness/9781541699427/) by George Bonanno, head of Columbia University's [Loss, Trauma and Emotion Lab](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/ltelab/), uses cross-cultural comparisons to talk about the science of resiliency.

[],,arrd3n,,,[],,,,text,t2_16b1fm,False,False,[],"&gt; On the one hand, govt should stay out of our personal health choices and should NOT be allowed to decide which businesses succeed or fail. On the OTHER hand, people should not be allowed to hurt other people, right? Even if that young person doesn't get symptoms, they can pass it along to everyone else in the community. 

IMO, this grossly simplifies the debate and harm caused by the current approach, and also dismisses the argument against the morality.  I've thought about this long and hard and have increasingly become sympathetic to the critics stance, but from a different angle.

Like you said, the government should really NOT be allowed to decide who fails and who succeeds and subsequently which lives are more important than other lives. And in the emergency case where this must be decided by those in power for the public good, there's a moral obligation for them to also in good faith make things whole for those that are getting their lives destroyed through no fault of their own.  Instead, we have actively observing governments and those in power actively choosing whole sectors to destroy while also leaving them high and dry.  They have prioritized one's life over someone else's.  Think of all the businesses and real people whose lives had been invested in them that are absolutely destroyed and they may never recover from.  I'd make the argument that this is at least just as bad of an outcome as being infected, but even worse because it was actively decided by the government for which people had zero control over.  

Ideally, we could shut down the highest risk activities in accordance with the science and data we have with full transparency.  This has clearly not been done (e.g. outdoor dining shut down while other riskier businesses get the arbitrary ""essential"" designation and thus remain unchecked despite proven widespread transmission, ICU capacity has been zero for weeks while high profit margin elective surgeries have been allowed to continue).  Effectively, those in power have decided to protect one group and shift that entire burden onto another group rather than take that burden on themselves or alleviate the burden from the harmed group.  

To make things worse, some how the public has been convinced that this is a deserved or morally acceptable burden.  IMO, if the government couldn't or was unwilling to follow the science/data and they were not prepared to protect those livelihoods that they were mandating be destroyed, then then unfortunately it would have been morally better for them to do nothing.  The government could've given those most at risk the means to stay safe and sustain being at home.  Instead they didn't do that either.  So instead somehow we've been convinced to accept this ridiculous standard that nothing else could have been done when in reality this was a massive government failure to both protect the health as well as the livelihoods during these times.  It's wrong to place that burden of the uncontrolled outbreak and deaths on those struggling to survive themselves specifically because of the government's mandates that are out of their control.  Not to mention this horrible policy is also fueled government mistrust, further contributing to why so many people no longer care and no longer believe the government has the competence or priority to make the best decisions to protect the public health and well being.",,,1610396361,{},gix78w0,False,t3_kukz3t,False,True,t1_givrfxw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kukz3t/north_dakota_sees_no_new_deaths_due_to_covid19/gix78w0/,1610449379,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Those 10-15 figures made sense back in spring, when testing was very limited.

But nowadays, even in the US, there can't be that many unreported cases. Let's pick a value of 10 for argument's sake. That would mean on any given day since November, there would have been 1-2M real infections. Over a period of ~70 days, we're talking about 70-140M infections for the entire US and that's besides the infections prior to November. We'd already be in herd immunity territory if that were the case. For ND only, there has been 82k confirmed cases since September, if the value of 10 was correct, that means there would have been more infections than the state population just during the last 4 months...

&gt; This may be playing out in other parts of the country too. I think the asymptomatic % is something that hasn't been measured enough and really should be.

I think there has been sufficient studies to have a pretty good idea on the rate of asymptomatics per age group.

It’s really unfortunate that you have to face negative reactions for expressing fears.

For what it’s worth: I’m putting my money where my mouth is, so to speak. I advised both my parents to get it (and they did indeed get both doses), I have advised my grandparents to get it (and they fully intend to), and I have advised my other loved ones and family to get it (and they fully intend to). And when I was offered the vaccine roughly two weeks ago, I quite literally *screamed* in happiness and signed up for the very first appointment I could get.

I’m very conscious of side effects of drugs and risks of medications (as my justifiably frustrated primary care doc would tell you), and I still have no hesitation here.

I’m only saying that this headline reads like he is jumping the gun by giving any definitive projection towards getting “back to normal” and getting people excited for a due date he can not assure them.

This is not an issue of fauci disagreeing with any analysis I’ve personally made. I’m only saying that headlines like this downplay where we are at RIGHT NOW with this virus, and I fear it undermines safety efforts made right now, which may impact the ability to stick to this projection date.

The nation’s seven-day average of coronavirus-related deaths has broken past 3,000 a day, reaching 3,249 on Sunday. And the cumulative total of virus deaths surpassed 375,000 on Monday, according to a New York Times database.

&gt;California alone reported more than 3,300 virus deaths in the week ended Sunday. No state except New York has recorded more than that in a single week.

&gt;The dire statistics follow a surge in new cases and hospitalizations that has extended to every part of the country. On average, 254,866 new cases a day have been reported over the past week, 38 percent more than two weeks earlier. As of Monday morning, a total of more than 22.4 million people in the United States have tested positive.

&gt;Health care facilities that have been scrambling to treat patients are also struggling to vaccinate people, amid widespread frustration and confusion across the country. With states and counties left largely to sort out the logistics by themselves, the vaccination program has gone anything but smoothly.

&gt;As of Monday, nearly nine million people had received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, far short of the federal goal of 20 million people or more by Dec. 31.

&gt;The federal government said Friday that it had delivered more than 22.1 million vaccine doses to states, territories and federal agencies. The same day, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said he would release nearly all available doses of the vaccine to states as soon as he is inaugurated. Federal officials have been holding back millions of vials to ensure that second doses will be available to those who received the first.

&gt;States have also begun broadening access to the shots faster than planned, amid tremendous public demand. Some states, including New York, Florida, Louisiana and Texas, have already expanded who is eligible to get a vaccine now, even though many people in the first priority group recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the nation’s 21 million health care workers and three million residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities — have yet to receive a shot.

&gt;Mr. Biden received his own second injection on Monday. His team said he would invoke the Defense Production Act if necessary to ensure that second doses can be given on schedule.

&gt;In an interview with NPR last week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said the high death toll was likely to continue, and was probably a reflection of increased travel and gatherings over the holidays.

&gt;”We believe things will get worse as we get into January,” he said.

&gt;But he stressed that it was still possible to “blunt that acceleration” by strictly adhering to public health measures like social distancing and mask wearing, practices that he said must continue even as people begin to get vaccinated.

That would not have helped. COVID-19 is clearly seasonal to some degree, as evidenced by the fact that nearly all of North America and Europe are seeing cases soar despite ever tightening restrictions, while cases were far lower during the summer months with fewer restrictions. 

Before you play the ""Australia and NZ beat Covid with a harsh real lockdown"" card, you should consider the immensely different geography of those countries to that of the US as well as said seasonality, not to mention the unfeasability of 4+ month harsh lockdowns to bring cases to 0 like the Australian state of Victoria did.

Abstract

Study objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread shortages of

personal protective equipment, including N95 respirators. Although basic surgical

facemasks are more commonly available, their efficacy is limited due primarily to their

poor face seal. This pilot study examined the impact of a rubber band mask brace on a

basic surgical mask, as determined by quantitative fit testing.

Methods: Subjects wearing a basic surgical facemask and the rubber band mask brace

underwent quantitative fit testing using machinery designed to certify N95 mask fit.

Subjects were tested with the brace anchored behind their ears, with a paperclip

behind the head, and on the side knobs of their face shields. The primary outcome mea-

sure was whether the subject passed the quantitative fit test at or above the Occupa-

tional Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)-verified standard for N95 masks.

Results: Subjects (n = 11) were 54.5% female, with a median height of 70 inches

(interquartile range \[IQR\] = 68–74), weight of 170 pounds (IQR = 145–215), and body

mass index (BMI) of 24.6 (IQR = 22.2–27.2), and encompassing 5 distinct N95 mask fit

types. We found that 45%, 100%, and 100% of subjects passed the quantitative fit test

when the brace was anchored behind the ears, with a paperclip and on a face shield,

respectively.

Conclusion: Of the 11 subjects included in the analysis, across a range of body habitus

and N95 mask fit types, all passed the quantitative fit test when the mask brace was

anchored on either face shield or with a paperclip. This data suggests that although the

brace does not create an N95 equivalent in terms of filtration, it would offer improved

protection from airborne viruses when worn with a basic surgical mask.",,,1610398334,{},gixbko4,True,t3_kvbsev,False,False,t3_kvbsev,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kvbsev/the_double_eights_mask_brace_improves_the_fit_and/gixbko4/,1610451790,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

However, I read some of [the discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kukz3t/north_dakota_sees_no_new_deaths_due_to_covid19/giu15q4/?context=3) you had with /u/hate_actually and I'm still unclear how the 3x rate wouldn't make sense.

Using the [Approach 4 data from the CDC](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/differences-in-positivity-rates), ND has a positivity rate of 6.94% (let's say 7%). If we applied a 3x rate for the entire pandemic, that would be 21% (I'm aware it should be a little higher because the rate was definitely more than 3x early on).

With the 1.4M tests done by ND (including antigen tests I presume), that would give 294k infected individual.

I don't see why we should take the peak % and apply it over the entire wave because a higher % could mean a better detection rate (lower than 3x). Or it could mean a detection rate that's identical, but there simply are more infections occurring at the peak, and if we apply the peak % for an extended period of time, then we overestimate the real number of infections.

I believe most of your argumentation relies on the number of individuals that would need to be tested to produce such numbers. Well, we know from the website you provided that people have been tested on average 4 times. BUT this creates a distortion towards people who don't get exposed to the virus. If a large share of infected are reported positive after 1 or 2 tests only, then the remainder (those who are apparently dodging the virus) get tested on average 5 or 6 times instead of 4.

And that approach also doesn't consider when the tests are done. Hypothetically, if the number of tests were constant between - say - May to December, you would get a very large share of the tested population that could have tested negative 1-2 times before the wave, and then caught the virus and not have been tested afterwards.

I disagree, because I think paid labor is the best way to incentivize people to do things at the moment. UBI would undermine that. I'm not offering any revolutionary idea like UBI, I'm just saying you're wrong.

&gt;That’s an understandable but ultimately meaningless point of view without contextualizing it and defining work or value or if you consider “endless growth” to be the ultimate object.

This is a straw man. I don't think endless growth is the ultimate object. It is not meaningless to say that capitalism motivates people to do work. Is it the best way to provide for everyone's needs? That is questionable. But I think human nature is to not do anything unless it has to be done.

&gt;That hasn’t proven to be true in studies with UBI. In fact people tend to be happy and healthier and begin seeking alternatives to the types of work they were shoehorned into prior to the study.

There is a lot of bullshit work out there, this is true. But some of that bullshit work actually needs to be done. How will you get someone to mop your office building except by paying them?

Capitalism is only as bad as society lets it be. We have a consumerist society/world because that's what people want. It's the lowest common denominator, and the most efficient way to provide everyone's wants and needs. If we want a carefully curated, sustainable, ethical way of life, a capitalist economy can provide that. But people are essentially lazy, and only want to spend the least amount of money on everything.

Automation will pose interesting challenges. It is only for automation that I think we can even have a serious argument for UBI. And until things are very automated, we will have to pay people who *must* work way more than anyone receiving a UBI.

By Antony Sguazzin

Johnson &amp; Johnson’s preliminary data from the South African arm of a phase 3 Covid-19 vaccine trial will be ready for submission to U.S. regulators by Jan. 21, according to the head of the country’s Medical Research Council.

The timing ties in with the U.S. drug giant’s statement that interim data from the late-stage trial it is conducting in a number of countries is expected by the end of this month. If the data show the one-dose vaccine to be safe and effective, J&amp;J will approach U.S. regulators for an emergency use authorization in February, and “other health regulatory applications around the world will be made in parallel,” according to the company.

Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientific adviser to the U.S. Operation Warp Speed program, has said the emergency clearance could be granted by U.S. regulators by early February.

J&amp;J is one of four vaccine developers running late-stage trials in South Africa. Business Day, a Johannesburg-based newspaper, reported the planned timing of the data submission earlier. It was confirmed by Glenda Gray, president of the research council and co-chair of the local study.

J&amp;J has signed an agreement under which Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. will manufacture 300 million doses a year in South Africa if the vaccine is approved.

&gt; Ivermectin acts by inhibiting the host importin alpha/beta-1 nuclear transport proteins, which are part of a key intracellular transport process that viruses hijack to enhance infection by suppressing the host antiviral response. Ivermectin is therefore a host-directed agent, which is likely the basis for its broad-spectrum activity in vitro against the viruses that cause dengue, Zika, HIV, and yellow fever.

Remember that ""in vitro"" (literally ""in glass"") means ""in a petri dish in the lab"".

But there's a big gotcha a little farther down:

&gt; Ivermectin has been shown to inhibit the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in cell cultures. However, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies suggest that achieving the plasma concentrations necessary for the antiviral efficacy detected in vitro would require administration of doses up to 100-fold higher than those approved for use in humans.

I'd like to see the studies you're referring to because all I can find is studies that show a strong correlation between mobility patterns and case counts.  

&gt;Case counts have fallen way more than 18% in ND. They're literally down 80% of the peak. I'd love to see the mobility data you cite, but can't believe it looks anything like ND's case graph.

You don't need to have a large drop in mobility to trigger a large drop in case counts...  Any time you remove people from the population, you remove a potential transmission vector.  

&gt;Cases in ND look like the entire rest of the Midwest. It takes an incredibly suspension of disbelief to think that mobility data in states as different as Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and Colorado all tracks and is different than California, Texas and Florida.

Here's the graphs for Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Wisconsin and Colorado.  Trend lines are all the same.  Smooth arch.  Period of viral seeding before exponential growth is hit then lag coming down. https://imgur.com/AVOTPT1

Compared to Florida where the trend line continues to rise.  https://imgur.com/Eie796a  

And California https://imgur.com/ycVFSar where they don't decrease mobility until nearly a month after North Dakota and the rest of the Midwest region.  And if you look at their cases, their peak was a month after North Dakota with what appears to be two outlier peaks for Christmas and New Years.  https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/california/  https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/north-dakota/

If we imagine this is true, then the ""max"" COVID deaths in the US would only be 575,000 (maybe as high as 700,000 if we imagine R0 is higher elsewhere, so herd immunity is reached later). In that case, we ripped society wide open and didn't even accomplish much. It *could* actually be a case of ""cure worse than the disease,"" but only because the cure was extremely ineffective. Obviously we had to keep hospitals above water, but this could have been done over the summer with a ""herd immunity"" strategy. In California, where cases were never high, they saw a massive surge in the winter. 

On the other hand, SD and ND might not be done. We've seen waves come and go, and not necessarily in line with restrictions. Places like NY, NJ, and MA are experiencing winter surges despite considerable death (which could correspond to considerable immunity), though, notably, these surges are smaller than in CA despite fewer restrictions. Immunity may be playing a significant role already, but perhaps it's waning in places that were hit early, leading to smaller surges. Alternatively, parts of ND and SD may have simply been spared, far enough from the hot spots that COVID has yet to really penetrate those communities. Though their nearly perfectly matched deaths/capita puts a wrench in this. Further, serology studies would tend to corroborate this, but we also know that antibodies are far from perfect and may wane long before immunity does. 

Clearly, there is a lot about this virus we don't yet understand.

It's going to be quite a bit lower, not just a ""bit.""  It's not randomized testing.  Those that are most likely to be tested are those with symptoms.  

&gt;I'm not talking about taking multiple tests on a given day. I'm talking about people taking multiple tests from mid-August to now.

Positivity rate is a single day measurement.  People taking multiple tests from mid-August to now would increase the number of tests (because it's unique tests as the denominator) which would lower the positivity rate.  I'm trying to give everybody the benefit of the doubt here and use maximum positivity rate numbers here.  You're actually lowering the positivity rate.

&gt;I just don't see how it's far-fetched that near 50% of ND has been infected looking at that graph you showed me.

Because of math.  It just doesn't work out.  And again, the serology testing doesn't show anywhere near 50% of the population as having had SARS-CoV-2.  The serology testing measures the number of people that have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 meaning they were previously infected.  If 50% of the population was previously infected, the serology testing should be around 50%.  It's nowhere near that.

&gt;On a day where 18.5% of COVID tests are positive (7-day average), what percentage of the population would you estimate currently has COVID?

You cannot tell based on that.  Positivity rate is skewed toward those that are symptomatic or had contact with an infected person.  The percent of the population that's actually infected is most likely going to be less than the positivity rate.",,,1610345841,{},giuk71m,False,t3_kukz3t,False,True,t1_giugic4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kukz3t/north_dakota_sees_no_new_deaths_due_to_covid19/giuk71m/,1610396060,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The trend lines are all the same despite differences in changes in mobility.

Those are mobility trend lines...  The mobility trend lines are the same.  The case waves are the same...  Florida and California have different mobility trend lines and the waves are different than any of the above states.  

&gt;Again, no idea how you can look at those and conclude what you're concluding. 

By literally using my eyes.  I can't figure out why you can't see that similar mobility trends correlate with the same wave and different mobility trend lines correlate with different wave patterns.  Honestly astonished.

&gt;If an 18% decrease in mobility over baseline is sufficient to trigger the collapse in cases we've seen in North Dakota (80% decrease in 6 weeks), why did the states in your graph that had greater than 18% decreases in the mobility all summer/fall see massive spikes?

Which states?  California?  Florida?  There were no massive spikes in mobility during the second wave because of the massive drop in mobility from the lockdowns.  Again, this disease comes in waves.  The waves last around 2-3 months.  But, one wave can seed the next wave which is what we have seen all over the United States which lead to the massive third wave that we're seeing now.  Everybody saw that the second wave was small and assumed that we could just go about our lives like normal despite nearly every freakin' scientist out there warning that a third wave was coming and going to hit hard.  

&gt;If an 18% change in mobility is sufficient to reduce R0 far enough below 1 to trigger these kinds of reductions, a state that averaged a 25% reduction in mobility over the summer should never have seen a surge.

Are you talking about from pre-virus baseline?  Because baseline isn't where you need to be going from.  You need to go based on the trend line.  The decrease from pre-virus baseline only tends to decrease the overall impact.  It doesn't stop the wave because the when people start moving, the virus moves with them.  Any change in decent change in mobility is going to have an impact on virus spread.  That decrease from the pre-virus ""baseline"" doesn't particularly matter because a new ""baseline"" is established during the period of viral seeding.  This isn't some new concept here...  

&gt;It looks to me like you're simply conflating correlation and causation.

Correlation does not rule out causation...  

&gt;Obviously people reduce mobility as cases increase.

Except in places like Florida...and guess what?  Cases are increasing still.  Which is what the mobility trend line shows and what the case count shows.

Most folk are actually generally following the guidelines and restrictions.

That said, I disagree with you (but downvoting, according to rediquette, is not for disagreeing - it's for posts that are off-topic, etc).

On the one hand, govt should stay out of our personal health choices and should NOT be allowed to decide which businesses succeed or fail.  On the OTHER hand, people should not be allowed to hurt other people, right?  Even if that young person doesn't get symptoms, they can pass it along to everyone else in the community.

So if a pack of people who didn't believe in the dangers of the virus could isolate themselves in a pro-covid community where no-one was allowed to leave til this was all over, I would be thrilled.  Have at it.  Catch it all you want.  Eat, drink, and be merry.  But you can only rely on the medical help of the folks INSIDE your barriers that were willing to stay.  And they can't call for Fed assistance because this is the fate they chose.

Honestly, that would be an awesome experiment.  Maybe your whole community would just get a few cases that would be no worse than a bad cold, then everyone would be immune and you guys would have a rocking time.  Or, maybe you'd all get terribly sick and have long-lasting side effects.  Who knows.  I'd be willing to watch that reality show and support your freedom to go drinking inside your isolated community.

Buuuut, don't you realize that unless such barriers exist, every one that comes in contact with it can be passing it on to folks who didn't volunteer to be part of your party?

It's like seat belts and no smoking signs.  The restrictions aren't always about limiting your freedoms - sometimes they're about protecting everyone else's.   I don't care if you don't want to wear a helmet on your Harley.  Frankly, the more idiots who die, the better the gene pool.  But I care that emergency workers have to spend more time scooping you off the highway because of ""freedom"" and now they can't help that family of four who did nothing wrong but we're hit by a drunk.  Or now the local brain surgeon has to work 35 hours on making sure you can walk again when you could be been fine if you'd worn a helmet.  Or now our community (taxes) have to pay for your 500k surgery and years of rehab and support because you can't walk or perform your job any more. 

If you are rich and can pay for all of the costs incurred by selfish choices - great, have at it, as long as that still means those rescuers are available to help all of the innocent victims, too.

So, do you think it's fair to make choices that can/will negatively (and directly) impact everyone else in your community?  Doesn't that strike you as selfish, at all?",,,1610374245,{'gid_2': 1},givrfxw,False,t3_kukz3t,False,False,t1_givfkcu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kukz3t/north_dakota_sees_no_new_deaths_due_to_covid19/givrfxw/,1610421105,45,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,

If you think about it, the virus has been spreading nearly unchecked for a year and has gone exponential. The law of large numbers says that it will just burn itself out eventually.

I think it is also interesting that fatalities have not grown nearly as fast as cases in the past 4-5 months. New York is at about 20% of their peak in fatalities in April while cases are at 200% of that same peak. Basically the recent cases are 10x less fatal.

Uhh... Is this a problem?  If they're adjusting their plan based on the issues and poor stats, that's a good thing, no?

New Jersey is interesting to me.  The governor is saying they don't have the doses, but if you check Bloomberg you see they haven't administered even a third of what they have.

I'm starting to wonder if ""delivered"" doesn't really mean delivered.  Like I could imagine this being the case in the Trump CDC: OWS tells Pfizer to send this many doses to this state.  They then mark them as delivered.  It then takes a day or two for Pfizer to get those doses packaged up and sent out and then it's on a truck for a day or two.  Maybe in some warehouse somewhere for a day, and then several days later it finally gets to the hospital or pharmacy.  So even though it's been marked as ""delivered"" by the CDC, it's not really delivered for like 5 or 6 days.  Just a theory right now, but [from this site](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)  I see this:

&gt;**Doses distributed** are cumulative counts of COVID-19 vaccine doses recorded as **shipped** in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Vaccine Tracking System (VTrckS) since December 13, 2020.

And that would seem to indicate that the numbers that we think states have might not actually be what we think they are.  Because to me ""distributed"" and ""shipped"" aren't really synonomous.  Distributed to me, implies it's at the PoC.  Shipped just means it's left the production facility.",,,1610377844,{},givzigv,False,t3_kuqjej,False,True,t1_givnoov,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kuqjej/gottlieb_says_vaccine_strategy_not_working_and_us/givzigv/,1610425615,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

TLDR: yes the likelihood is greater from covid for certain clinical manifestations like Stroke. But, it’s like 1.6x more likely to occur compared to the flu. Have you ever worried about a stroke following the flu? Probably not. Is 1.6x that worry a big deal? Probably not.

**The new pandemic law is in force from today.** **Here are four common questions - and the answers.** 

## What new law, are the laws we already have not enough?

So far, the government has had few laws to enact to limit the spread of infection, above all the Public Order Act and the Alcohol Act have been used. The problem is that they are not intended for pandemic management and they can only regulate certain activities.

What is new now is, among other things, that the government, or the authorities, [can decide on infection control rules](https://www.dn.se/sverige/skarpta-smittregler-for-gym-och-butiker/) in such activities that have not been covered before. These can be gyms, shops, party rooms, public transport and sports facilities, to name a few.

The law is flexible in the sense that it does not say ""a maximum of five people may stay together"" already now, instead the law means that the government can come up with more specific restrictions, if the infection situation requires it.

In practical terms, it can be about limited opening hours or the number of visitors that are allowed in different contexts. The government will also be able to decide how many people may gather in a public place.

## Am I not allowed to move the way I want anymore? We live in a free country, right?

Yes and no. It is not about a total closure or a travel ban like some other countries in Europe. To change the freedom of movement, which is constitutionally protected, two Riksdag decisions are required with a parliamentary election in between. That is not what has been decided now.

The Pandemic Act provides the opportunity to ""be able to close down activities and restrict crowds in places to which the public has access."" If, for example, you violate matters concerning access to a public place, there may be a fine.

## What happens if I break the law then?

Of course, it depends on the individual situation. But with the new law, it is possible to issue a fine to anyone who, for example, violates regulations on access to public places. The same applies to companies that do not follow the rules.

## How long does this pandemic law apply?

The original idea was March 2022, but what has now been hammered through is September this year. Should the social situation continue to be serious even as autumn approaches, it is not too qualified a guess that an extension can become a reality. Everything seems to depend on the future spread of infection.

## Facts: The temporary covid-19 law

The purpose of the temporary law is to give the government and other authorities increased opportunities to introduce measures, without restricting activities that can be carried out infection-proof.

The government can decide on limited opening hours or how many people can stay in a room or place. In very serious cases, businesses can be completely shut down or shut down.

**Activities covered by the law are:**

● theater, cinema, football matches and other public gatherings and public events

● gyms, campsites, zoos, museums and other places for leisure or cultural activities

● shops, shopping centers and the like

● public transport and domestic air transport

● premises, such as party rooms, and places for private gatherings

● public places, such as parks and bathing areas

**The government can also** introduce a ban on gathering in a company of a certain size in a public place. Anyone who violates the ban on staying in a public place can be fined. County administrative boards and municipalities have the right to make local decisions to limit the spread of infection.

The Government must allow the Riksdag to review the decision within one week of the decision on the ban or closure.

**From the beginning, it was proposed that the** law enter into force on 15 March 2021 and apply until the end of March 2022. After criticism, it is now proposed that the law be introduced as early as 10 January and that it expire on the last day of September 2021.

In a dense city herd immunity would have to be a lot higher than somewhere like ND. In a low population/low density area you just dont come in contact with as many people, so the chances of catching it are already lower. Hence why the growth curve was so much flatter for them. In a place like NYC you can see exponential growth of a virus in a couple weeks. In ND it took months for it to get out of control.  


Also, herd immunity isn't some magic number, its a sliding scale. To maximize herd immunity you may need 50 or 60 or 70 or 80%, but obviously the more people who get a virus the less likely it is to spread as quickly.  


So even if only 30% of people got it, thats 30% fewer people who can spread it. Then when it gets to 40% its that much harder for it to spread. Then you get close to 50% and so on... It takes longer and longer for the virus to spread the closer you get to herd immunity. And again this will depend on where you are. If you're in a huge city and 50% of people have had it, but you still come into contact with thousands of people a day, it wouldn't take many to infect hundreds more. If you're in a small town and only see a couple dozen people a day and half of them have already had it that only leaves a few people who can still get it and pass it onto others.

some variants/strains may have reduced efficacy, but it's unlikely that a new strain is completely unaffected by the vaccine.

Even the flu which mutates quickly has some cross-immunity between various strains.

In very broken English she tries to sell me some small packages wrapped in aluminum foil. I, being from the rural northeast assumed they were burritos and told her (in my best Spanish which I'm sure was sub par) that I had already eaten breakfast and wasn't hungry, but thank you.

She nodded and walked off.

I told some of my friends in class about it and every single one of them chuckled or outright laughed, and told me that I had passed on probably the greatest Mexican food I'd ever eat. That ""Literally nobody cooks tamales better than Mexican grandmas"".

[Forbes- what the CDC says about immunity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/08/15/how-long-are-you-immune-after-covid-19-coronavirus-here-is-what-cdc-now-suggests/)

[BBC Health](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52446965)

[NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/07/23/894670842/how-long-will-immunity-to-the-coronavirus-last)

This is what I found with a quick Google search.
Consider following up with sources yourself next time to avoid looking like an obtuse asshole. 

Key points to note:
CDC is advising that prior infection is not a reason to not get vaccinated. Still get vaccinated. 

BBC quoted a study from China of 175 people that found 30% had very low levels of neutralising antibodies.

BBC also pointed out regarding the six other common coronavirus strains, ""Four produce the symptoms of the common cold and immunity is short-lived. Studies showed some patients could be re-infected within a year.""

Also from BBC, ""Scientists from Hong Kong recently reported on the case of a young, healthy man who recovered from a bout of Covid-19 only to be re-infected more than four months later. Using genome sequencing of the virus, they could prove he caught it twice because the virus strains were different.""

So what I was recalling is not incorrect, but neither are you. Right now, they are only confident immunity lasts for 3 months, some limited studies are indicating the immunity could falter before a year is up, but what we know about viruses that cause a very strong immune response is that immunity usually remains for years or even decades. That's why scientists are saying they expect natural immunity to be generally long lived. 

However, with the majority of cases being mild or even asymptomatic, long term immunity cannot be the default assumption. We also know that more strains are popping up now, and with more exposure to more people, viruses become more likely to mutate. Differences in the genomes between strains has been shown to be a limitation on immunity.

There is not enough information and certainly not enough time has passed to get it, so the best advice is to be conservative with your expectations and proceed with caution. Our best hope is to produce strong and consistent immune responses with the vaccine and limit viral mutations via exposure.",,,1610348867,{},giuo2q6,False,t3_kubeqj,False,True,t1_giufi90,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kubeqj/us_coronavirus_more_than_2_million_people_have/giuo2q6/,1610398837,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That’s basic knowledge. Then we were told to wear whatever we could find including socks on our faces. This is when I began to get angry. Then we were given different emergency use medications. Then they were pulled for causing more harm then good. Then the emergency use vaccine came to be. A lot of nurses are females who are child bearing age.

We love all the vaccines that have been studied for 10+ years and have been proven to be very safe.

Nope! Turns out it was an anecdotal interview with ONE ER doctor who was talking about CT scans of those who were sick enough with covid to be hospitalized.

Importantly there were **zero** hospitalizations or severe cases in the dosing group 21 days after the first dose. The Oxford vaccine also showed evidence of a reduction in asymptomatic infection after a single dose.  And the safety data was great.

Also, I suspect that if you opened all the restaurants it would just increase the amount of contact going on in the population; people who aren't eating out now would be going, and a good portion of those having private gatherings would now start going to restaurants as well as having people over.

We're in by far the worst shape of the whole pandemic right now in Canada; right now we need to do something to get this under control, because the more it gets out of control the worse the consequences will eventually be.  We should have taken hard action in the fall to cut off the second wave before it got this bad, and we probably could've controlled it pretty fast; now we'd need weeks or months of lockdown to achieve the same thing.

Additionally, it's also a country historically opposed to vaccination as the government can be sued for vaccines that have side-effects due to their healthcare system.

1. We don't know how effective the current vaccines, geared for the current major strain, will be against the new variants.  Yes, new variants plural.
2. RNA-based replication, by its very nature, is already highly mutagenic.  Every single replication has the opportunity for transcription errors (aka, mutations).  Every single person infected will contribute countless new copies of the virus, and at least some non-zero number will have mutations.
3. Most mutations are good for us.  Weaker, less contagious, less lethal.  The bad mutations generate strains like 1.1.7.B.
4. Many people are unable to receive some/any vaccines due to allergiesand/or pre-existing medical conditions.  Herd immunity helps protect those.  Reckless behavior puts them and others at risk.
5. Our medical providers only have so many resources, whether those are people, beds, breathing apparatuses, or medicines.  Once you eclipse the weakest link, you invoke triage.  People will die.

&amp;#x200B;

Get vaccinated.  Do your part to stay healthy.  Do your part to minimize the risk to others.  Stay home unless necessary.  Wear a mask.  Wash your hands.

1) There are unreported cases because some people do not get tested (example: if a spouse tests positive and you're also sick) or cannot get tested (which was especially true early on). Anecdotally, I know several people who have had COVID, have had blood tests to prove they have antibodies for COVID, but were unable to get a test when they were actually sick. How that has improved now vs then that testing is (mostly) readily available is unknown. Likewise, half this country thinks COVID is ""just the flu"". Do you think they're getting tested when they're sick? I don't.

If anecdotal is not good enough, studies have also been done. Here's two (warning, they have big words): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239078/ and https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18272-4

2) The very nature of asymptomatic cases is that you have no symptoms. People are testing positive with no symptoms because they have to get tests via their line of work or because of contact tracing / exposure. Therefore, if people who are getting tested without symptoms are testing positive, it logically stands that others are positive and are NOT getting tested too. Getting a handle on the true scale of this is practically impossible.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. How did we get these vaccines so quickly? Did we skimp on safety to do it?

The administration did a great job promoting vaccine development. (I will gladly give credit where credit is due.) They did this by funding vaccine research and manufacturing. It normally takes 10-20 years and $1 billion to bring a vaccine to market. Our government subsidized the money. Our scientists pivoted from other vaccines they were working on to make coronavirus vaccines. We were lucky that they picked the right protein (the spike protein) and that the spike protein does not seem to mutate in a way that would make the vaccine ineffective. They rushed through the early phases where they normally give the vaccine to a few hundred people and watch for side effects and got quickly to the point where they gave it to large numbers of volunteers. We all owe these volunteers a huge “thank you!” because they were accepting a risk. That is where the rushing stopped. This is at the point that we call “phase 3” trials. These trials are being conducted at the highest level to provide the best available kind of data: randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. They have independent review boards who are evaluating every case of coronavirus in the volunteers and every case of possible side effects. In a good news / bad news kind of way, the phase 3 trials have gone faster than expected because the virus is so out of control in our country right now. This means that it is easier for the volunteers to catch the virus, and the review board can determine if the people who caught the virus were in the group that got the vaccine or the group that got the placebo. We have to wait until 2 months after most of the volunteers received their booster dose to be able to look at safety data. All known serious side effects of vaccines already on the market so far have come within 2 months of receiving a vaccine, so I do think that waiting 2 months is an adequate amount of time.

2.  What vaccines are out there right now?

We currently have 5 vaccines who are major players in the US (in or about to start phase 3 trials). Four of them use technology which no current standard US vaccine on the market uses, but that vaccine developers have been working on for a long time. Let’s break them down:
a.  mRNA vaccines (commonly called the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines): these have mRNA genetic code which are surrounded by lipids. The lipid particles enter your muscle cells, then the mRNA goes to the ribosomes in those cells where the mRNA is translated into a part of the coronavirus spike protein. Your body then recognizes the spike protein as foreign and forms an immune response against it
b.  adenovirus vector vaccines (commonly called the Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines): these use an uncommon form of a common virus which has been modified in two ways: the virus cannot make copies of itself; the viral DNA contains the code for the coronavirus spike protein. This works by injecting billions of copies of the adenovirus into your muscle. The adenovirus then infects your muscle cell and uses your cell’s organelles to make its own proteins (including the spike protein). Your body then recognizes the spike protein as foreign and forms an immune response against it.
c.  Protein vaccines (commonly called Novavax vaccine): This uses the same technology used in the current HBV and HPV vaccines, which are extremely safe and effective vaccines. The vaccine is an injection of the spike protein itself (which is made by yeast cells in a lab) plus something called an adjuvant (which is a chemical that prompts your body to form an immune response).

3.  What are the pros / cons of these vaccines?

The pros of the mRNA vaccines are that they seem to have good efficacy and safety (final data is not available for any vaccine right now) and can be manufactured relatively easily (which is why we are hearing about them first). The cons of these vaccines are that they are difficult to store and transport as they require cold temperatures, and it’s a new technology. The pros of the adenovirus vaccines are that they are relatively easy to manufacture and transport, and the J&amp;J vaccine seems to only require one dose. The cons are that they are the ones whose trials have been stopped for possible serious side effects and since you are injecting a virus into people, can more commonly cause less serious (but still annoying) side effects like fever. We will need to see the final safety data on all of the vaccines, but especially the adenovirus ones. The pro of the Novavax vaccine is that it uses tried and true vaccine technology. The cons are that it takes longer to manufacture, and we really have no safety or efficacy data yet since they are just starting phase 3 trials.

4.  What about the recent news on efficacy from Pfizer and Moderna?

I am very excited to hear the efficacy news coming out. For one, it means that scientists were probably correct to focus on the spike protein, which means all of the vaccines in development have a better chance of working. Also, if it is 95% effective, that is way higher than experts were predicting. Fewer people will need to be immunized to achieve herd immunity.

5.  Do I think these vaccines are safe? Would I get the vaccine right now?

I trust the FDA approval process as it is set up right now. If the FDA approves the vaccine, I will get the first vaccine offered to me. Not knowing about final data, if right now you placed all five vaccines in front of me and said, “which one would you pick?” I’d probably pick the Novavax, then Moderna, then Pfizer, then J&amp;J, then AstraZeneca. The upcoming months are going to provide so much more information on this though and I completely reserve the right to change my mind. When I decide whether or not to get a vaccine, I am asking myself, “does the benefit of this vaccine outweigh the risk?” Even when we get the data from the phase 3 trials we will not know if there is a very small risk of severe side effects with these vaccines. A famous vaccine developer once said, “I never breathe a sigh of relief until the first 3 million doses have been given.” I do know that there is a real risk of long-term side effects from catching coronavirus, so at this point I would say that (assuming safety data is what we are predicting, and the FDA approves a vaccine) the benefit outweighs the risk, even if the vaccine carries serious but extremely rare side effects.

6.  What is the timeline for these vaccines? When do we get “back to normal”?

To be honest, I expect manufacture and distribution of these vaccines in the next 6 months to be a complete nightmare. We know that the following people will have priority: essential workers (a category which includes different people depending on who you ask), age &gt; 65 years, high risk medical condition (a category which includes different diagnoses depending on who you ask). If you take a broad view of these categories (for example, including obese adults who make up 30% of the population), then we are talking about 150 million Americans who should get it first. Even with our increased efforts, we are nowhere close to having enough vaccine and the distribution capability to vaccinate that many people quickly. I anticipate healthcare workers and first responders to be vaccinated December – February, and other high-risk adults to be vaccinated March – summer. That would have low risk adults being vaccinated summer 2021 and kids being vaccinated fall 2021 (they are just now starting small trials in some children 12 and over). This current prediction means experts will be recommending other health measures like physical distancing, avoiding crowds and wearing masks through fall 2021. I do feel optimistic that this will be our only holiday season with these public health restrictions.",,,1610372638,{},givo5ks,False,t3_kug3zu,False,True,t1_givlywi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kug3zu/im_not_an_antivaxxer_but_us_health_workers/givo5ks/,1610419224,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

A 50 percent more transmissible virus, Lipsitch says, means “we need to cut our contacts down by another third compared to the already strong restrictions [already in place] in order to get back to the same place where we were.” That could mean closing down businesses that have partially opened back up, closing down schools, and other such lockdown measures.

If communities do nothing in the face of a more contagious variant, the numbers could add up very quickly. Bill Hanage, another Harvard epidemiologist, walked me through the following thought experiment.

Hi, I'm a little bit conflicted right now, we've been talking about getting the COVID vaccine as soon as we can, and my girlfriend says that she doesn't want to get it yet. She's healthy and young, so maybe it's not the biggest deal right now, and that's why she'd rather wait a bit. I, on the other hand, will get one as soon as it's my turn.

I don't have the best argumentation skills, so it's actually pretty difficult for me to lay the points down confidently. My points, even to me sound quite simplistic, so I'd like to bring up some better ones with your help.

* Even if she's worried about unforeseen side effects, it's probably a much better chance than with Covid, even if she's healthy. - I don't have a rebuttal against ""How can you know if it's going to be safe 1 or 2 years down the line?"". My logic tells me that it's unlikely to develop any weird side effects after such a long time, but where can I read up on this?
* She's from Russia, where from what I gather the general opinion is a little against vaccines for whatever reason. From tiny bits of looking into this, their flu shots are like a small dose of flu to teach body to fight against it, or at least that's what I've heard people say. (I know this isn't what COVID vaccine is, and by the looks of it, that isn't how flu shots work in UK where we are). I realise how ignorant this sounds, I don't know the proper names or methods, but that's also where my trouble of convincing her comes from. So she's had some bad experience with flu shots when she was a child, like being ill after each one of them, so she hasn't had a flu shot since she was 13.
* It doesn't help that 2 of her friends in Russia, told her that their parents are doing whatever they can to avoid mandatory vaccination in hospitals for themselves",,,1610375358,{},givtv21,False,t3_kuyacf,False,True,t3_kuyacf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kuyacf/daily_discussion_thread_january_11_2021/givtv21/,1610422456,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Potential?  Sure.  But I feel like people only look at one side of the coin.  I'll get back to that.

&gt;Why is there such a strong defense of the bureaucratic nightmare that's been set up versus just getting it in people's arms?

Because ""just getting it in people's arms"" doesn't save very many lives.

This virus has a VERY skewed death and damage effects.  100 vaccines in nursing home residents and workers does WAY more to ease the burden of this pandemic than 100 doses in the arms of healthy 30 year olds working from home.  Shit, it does WAY more than even 1000 doses in the arms of healthy 30 year olds who WFH.

We don't have the vaccines to make a difference in terms of herd immunity so opening the gates just yet ain't the deal.

[We can also see how it's a shitshow in Florida still even with ample population to dose.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/us/coronavirus-vaccine-florida.html)  So obviously it's not **just** that we are having this strict phases that is causing problems.

They've ""opened the floodgates"" and their numbers aren't top of the line.  They're better than average, but if the only issue was these oppressive tier categories, we should have seen [them rocket to the the top over the last week](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/), but they still lag behind several states.

So I defend the beauracratic nightmare that's been set up because I have evidence that it isn't just that bureacratic nightmare that is causing a slow rollout.

So, now back to the doses thrown out.  We can look at the [3 or 4 doses thrown out in New York](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/10/health/covid-19-vaccine-unused/index.html) and screech about how they should have gone in arms and how Cuomo is killing people with his $1M fines.

But we can't ignore that in the absence of these laws, people do [jump the line](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kq7w08/health_officials_give_vaccine_to_close_contacts/gi3upgg/?context=3).  It isn't hard to mix extra doses that will ""go to waste"" and then call up those close to you.

So how do you balance the two things?  It's tough to say the least because 1 shot in the arm of an over 75 or a nursing home patient does more WAY more good than 1 shot in the arm of a healthy 35 year old.


Here's my belief:  Much of the issues stem from the federal government, but people want states to fix the issues on their own.  They can't.  Most of them don't have the money, they don't have the resources, and they don't have the complete picture of what is going on.

We can look at the larger cities to gauge where we're at for herd immunity as disease is more likely to spread in populated areas than in less dense areas.  We can look at Cass county where Fargo is located and see that they had 20,366 total cases for a population of 181,923.  That's around 11.2%.  We can also look at less dense areas like Slope County.  They had 30 cases with a population of 742 which is 4%.  I think most of the counties on the rural end of things drop off like that.  Just randomly picking counties, I'm seeing highs of maybe 14-15%.

Originally estimated as high as 3-5% the CDC and WHO and other studies are saying closer to 0.25%.

I'd like to see a study that puts the US's IFR at 0.25%.  Our own calculations show it between 0.67-1.24 (95% CI).  And this is well in line with most other IFRs calculated for the US.

&gt;The upshot is that for every sick person that presents as a case there are many people that are not cases but instead are asymptomatic or only mildly ill such that they do not see a doctor.

Again, the number of people that remain asymptomatic is fairly small.  It's not just one study that shows this.  The other meta analysis study that had 20,000 follow ups showed 17%.  

&gt;Are you suggesting that the number of infections is only 20% higher than the number of cases? I just don't see how that can be the case.

Why can't you see that being the case?  It's a lot easier for that to be the case than to imagine that herd immunity has somehow kicked in in North Dakota when the seroprevalence is only showing 10.7%.  We can look at Manaus Brazil as an example.  The seroprevalence there was 44-66% by September and it was held up as a model of the first place to achieve herd immunity by natural infection.  Guess what happened right after the paper hit biorxiv?  Another large spike in cases.  Yet, somehow, we're supposed to play make believe and assume that North Dakota, with its 10.7% seroprevalence, must be feeling the effects of herd immunity when a place with 44-66% seroprevalence didn't manage to achieve herd immunity?  

I'll tell you what happened in North Dakota and what's going to happen.  When cases began to spike, the mobility shifted downward by 18%.  This caused cases to drop and the wave to subside.  The waves for basically every place last for between 2-3 months because we see similar patterns in the population...  Cases increase, people start to worry, reduce mobility, cases go down.  Toward the end of the year, we had Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years.  These increased mobility which will lead to another increase in cases but, this time will be less impactful (because mobility went back to decreased levels shortly after) and they are beginning vaccination.  We're already starting to see an uptick in cases in North Dakota over the past few weeks (from ~90 low point to ~300 currently).  Same thing we see in South Dakota, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Montana.  We can expect to see the next wave when mobility increases and stays level at an increased rate (unless vaccine distribution picks up).",,,1610384157,{},giwfd2s,False,t3_kukz3t,False,False,t1_giw7s0o,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kukz3t/north_dakota_sees_no_new_deaths_due_to_covid19/giwfd2s/,1610434421,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

## Abstract

Background: Lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir-interferon (IFN)-beta-1a and hydroxychloroquine efficacy for COVID-19 have been evaluated, but detailed evaluation is lacking. Objective: To determine the efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-beta-1a, hydroxychloroquine or remdesivir for improving the clinical, virological outcomes in COVID-19 inpatients. Design: Open-label, randomized, adaptive, controlled trial. Setting: Multi-center trial with patients from France. Participants: 583 COVID-19 inpatients requiring oxygen and/or ventilatory support Intervention: Standard of care (SoC, control), SoC plus lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg lopinavir and 100 mg ritonavir every 12h for 14 days), SoC plus lopinavir/ritonavir plus IFN-beta-1a (44 micrograms of subcutaneous IFN-beta-1a on days 1, 3, and 6), SoC plus hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice on day 1 then 400 mg once daily for 9 days) or SoC plus remdesivir (200 mg intravenously on day 1 then 100 mg once-daily for hospitalization duration or 10 days). Measurements: The primary outcome was the clinical status at day 15, measured by the WHO 7-point ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 quantification in respiratory specimens and safety analyses. Results: Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) for the WHO 7-point ordinal scale were not in favor of investigational treatments: lopinavir/ritonavir versus control, aOR 0.83, 95%CI, 0.55 to 1.26, P=0.39; lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-beta-1a versus control, aOR 0.69, 95%CI, 0.45 to 1.04, P=0.08; hydroxychloroquine versus control, aOR 0.93, 95%CI, 0.62 to 1.41, P=0.75. No significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance in respiratory tract was evidenced. Lopinavir/ritonavir-containing treatments were significantly associated with more SAE. Limitations: Not a placebo-controlled, no anti-inflammatory agents tested. Conclusion: No improvement of the clinical status at day 15 nor SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance in respiratory tract specimens by studied drugs. This comforts the recent Solidarity findings.

## Abstract

**Background:** Few specific medications have been proven effective for the treatment of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we tested whether high-dose vitamin C infusion was effective for severe COVID-19.

**Methods:** This randomized, controlled, clinical trial was performed at 3 hospitals in Hubei, China. Patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the ICU were randomly assigned in as 1:1 ratio to either the high-dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) or the placebo. HDIVC group received 12 g of vitamin C/50 ml every 12 h for 7 days at a rate of 12 ml/hour, and the placebo group received bacteriostatic water for injection in the same way within 48 h of arrival to ICU. The primary outcome was invasive mechanical ventilation-free days in 28 days (IMVFD28). Secondary outcomes were 28-day mortality, organ failure (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score), and inflammation progression (interleukin-6).

**Results:** Only 56 critical COVID-19 patients were ultimately recruited due to the early control of the outbreak. There was no difference in IMVFD28 between two groups (26.0 \[9.0-28.0\] in HDIVC vs 22.0 \[8.50-28.0\] in control, p = 0.57). HDIVC failed to reduce 28-day mortality (P = 0.27). During the 7-day treatment period, patients in the HDIVC group had a steady rise in the PaO2/FiO2 (day 7: 229 vs. 151 mmHg, 95% CI 33 to 122, P = 0.01), which was not observed in the control group. IL-6 in the HDIVC group was lower than that in the control group (19.42 vs. 158.00; 95% CI -301.72 to -29.79; P = 0.04) on day 7.

**Conclusion:** This pilot trial showed that HDIVC failed to improve IMVFD28, but might show a potential signal of benefit in oxygenation for critically ill patients with COVID-19 improving PaO2/FiO2 even though.

First of all, millions of people are receiving the vaccine at the same time. Insanely rare, one-in-a-million things happen all the time, people die, people get sick, etc. Medscape says that ITP occurs in 66 people per million, per year. Divide by 12 and that's 5 and a half people per month. Roughly 5 million people have received the vaccination in roughly the past month, so one report of one person developing ITP after the vaccine seems very likely to be sheer coincidence based on how many vaccines have been given out. 

The fact that an investigation is being done does not mean that they necessarily think there is a link, but more that safety is being prioritized and every possible adverse event is being taken seriously, even if the likelihood of it being the cause is very low. 

Secondly, even if we place statistics aside and assume that *every single* ""post-vaccine incident"" is directly caused by the vaccine, you're looking at a single-digit handful per million of poor outcomes.

“The hope was that it would help patients recover faster … it would help them get better faster or prevent their disease from progressing,” said Dr. Tim Jenkins, an infectious disease doctor at Denver Health whose job is to evaluate potential therapies for COVID-19 patients. “None of these recent studies have shown that.” 

None of the nearly 40 patients who have received convalescent plasma at Denver Health since April had a dramatic turnaround because of it, Jenkins said. And no real benefits were found in an observational study of hospitalized patients who were given convalescent plasma at Denver Health and UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora beginning last spring.

Similarly, a [study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2031304) published in the New England Journal of Medicine in November found “no significant differences” in mortality rates between more than 200 patients in Argentina who were given either convalescent plasma or a placebo. 

Still, a handful of large-scale studies are ongoing and researchers are trying to pinpoint whether the plasma helps a specific subset of patients — most likely patients who are at the beginning of their illness and not already hospitalized.   
A [study published this week](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2033700), for example, found that older adults who received a plasma transfusion within three days of getting coronavirus symptoms were less likely to get as severely ill as those who did not.

As long as it is being closely tracked which first dose is received by any given person.  We don't want to be in a situation where the booster is from a different manufacturer.

This is a race against the infection rate.  Suffice to say after all these months it is absolutely clear that not enough people are exercising the required measures of social distancing, masking, and travel to stop infection rate from increasing exponentially.  If hospitals collapse anything requiring critical care would then be fatal.  

Not storing the 2nd doses is not without risk.   If anything happens to slow down vaccine production the train goes off the rails.  

Realistically though Pfizer is sure they will be able to meet their production demands and more vaccine will enter the chain from more manufacturers.  It is highly unlikely over the course of 21 days, that it will not be possible to secure a 2nd dose for a person known to need a booster by a particular date.  Hopefully the booster appointments are being made at time of vaccination as part of standard procedure. That won't a hard logistical problem to solve.  This will call for vaccine  supply to be tracked on a National level, something I am confident will happen when adults are in the room on the 20th.

Worse case any shortage in supply will just lead to new vaccination dates being pushed back rather than boosters being pushed back.

Secondly, shortages are less and less likely if you look at the populations of the most priority groups vs. the amount of vaccine they will actually require.  

It is easy to get lost in an idea of ""300 mil people needing to get vaccinated"".  But of those 300 mil, maybe 210 million take it.  Of that same population 300 mil say 12% are 70 or older.  That is 3.6 million people.  Tip of the iceberg, but what is accounting for a large part of hospitalizations and deaths.

We need to get these smaller early phase groups vaccinated as quickly as possible, so hospitals can get out of the danger zone as soon as possible.   After that we can consider holding aside doses as the threat of a supply disruption becomes more of a threat.  Honestly though, that  isn't very likely until way into the vaccine being open to the general public and by that time, if we stop stalling out on phase 1a and 1b, the situation in hospitals should be a lot better.

Only certain airlines are allowed to fly, each once/twice per week to their respective destinations. There is a circuit breaker rule in place: if the inbound flight results in X number of cases, the whole route will be suspended for Y days.

On top of that: all passengers must present a valid green code before boarding. You get that by testing negative on both the PCR and IGm tests, submitted to the  local embassy and verified by its staff. Tests must have been conducted within 48 hours of leaving. Oh, and the code must be issued by the embassy of the country from the last leg of your flight... so basically no transfer flights.

On top of that, once you arrive you must complete a state-run quarantine. Basically you get off the flight, your visa/passport get processed, you get a PCR test, and then they shuttle you off to a quarantine hotel. You have no choice of where you will be placed. You will be separated from your family (except for kids - these can stay with one of the parents). You may not leave the room for any reason - just open the door to get food delivery or put out the trash. If you do leave and attempt to see a family member, both of your quarantine periods will restart. You get tested at least four times (PCR) and you’re required to submit your body temperature readings twice a day.

From a Healthcare provider's perspective, please consider that some have already had COVID and should have immunity.  Some are eligible but have allergic reactions that contraindicated the vaccine.  Some have seen their coworkers go on 5 day bedrest and know that their unit cannot support everyone being out at once.  Some know that their PPE and sanitizing procedures have kept them safe for almost a year at this point... Any of them would probably give their vaccine allocation to someone else at higher risk if they could, as long as the hospital PPE is well-stocked.

It essentially is if you're looking at the total number of people that test positive per number of tests performed in a given time frame.

If you use lower positivity rates, then the population that would need to get tested to achieve the number of positive increases.  For example, for a positivity rate of 14%, over the same time frame, 1.72 million people would need to be tested.

From the linked article: “Democracies have a higher probability of increased human-trafficking inflows than non-democratic countries. There is a 13.4% higher probability of receiving higher inflows in a democratic country than otherwise.”

“While trafficking inflows may be lower where prostitution is criminalized, there may be severe repercussions for those working in the industry. For example, criminalizing prostitution penalizes sex workers rather than the people who earn most of the profits (pimps and traffickers).”

““The likely negative consequences of legalised prostitution on a country’s inflows of human trafficking might be seen to support those who argue in favour of banning prostitution, thereby reducing the flows of trafficking,” the researchers state. “However, such a line of argumentation overlooks potential benefits that the legalisation of prostitution might have on those employed in the industry. Working conditions could be substantially improved for prostitutes — at least those legally employed — if prostitution is legalised. Prohibiting prostitution also raises tricky ‘freedom of choice’ issues concerning both the potential suppliers and clients of prostitution services.”

The answer to you weebs is that Japan is fucked just like the rest of us. The only difference is the Japanese government just doesn't have the willingness to test its people. There's no reason China has the capability to test [11 MILLION PEOPLE daily](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/11-million-locked-down-in-chinas-hebei-province-to-prevent-spread-of-new-coronavirus-outbreak/ar-BB1cBQ9F) in a single province MULTIPLE TIMES over a period of like 12 days and Japan [still has only performed over 100k daily tests *one time*](https://covid19japan.com/) and consistently performs 15-60k tests/day nationally, for a country of 127m. Japan has yet to perform 6m covid tests. That is fucking disgusting for any advanced economy like Japan in the worst pandemic in 100 years.

So say what you want about the US, but Japan has done only 5.5 million tests (see above link), while the US has done **over 268 million**, per [this](https://covidtracking.com/data/national). The US consistently has a [positivity rate of about 5%](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states), while Japan's positivity rate ranges from 5-16%+, eyeballing it from [here](https://covid19japan.com/) and from the past two weeks' daily reports on this sub.

So Japan has barely 1/48 of the US' testing capacity with a population roughly 1/2 of the US, and a higher positivity rate than the US. And to all the weebs on this sub, Japan is doing ""good"".

I watched the announcements and science around masks closely from the beginning and I agree it has been very mixed. Fauci himself did not recommend wearing a mask early on. The WHO and CDC have still not, to this day, confirmed that the virus is transmitted airborne. They keep changing their publications but all are to the tune of ""there are theories"" and ""further study is required"". Wearing masks has become like a religious topic to many but there is still no real proof that they work or help, and my view is that distracts people from other ways that the virus can be spread.

There was an ER doc on the front lines in NYC that was so convinced that he did not think that airborne transmission was happening that he put out a YouTube video about it which got millions of views.

I also agree with you that people are so ready to label someone as an ""anti-vaxxer"" if they don't immediately embrace the vaccine. I personally will take it but I can see why people don't want to take a brand new medicine especially if they are not at much risk. The risk of Covid is highly concentrated in the elderly with pre-existing conditions. Healthy 18-50 year olds are simply not at lot of risk. If it were me and I was in health care and dealing with sick people all day I would definitely take it but I can see how it is debatable.

&gt; ""The overall noninstitutionalized IFR was 0.26%.""

Tested until April...  The first known death at the time was February and deaths that were from COVID were still being counted as influenza deaths.  

&gt;https://www.who.int/bulletin/online_first/BLT.20.265892.pdf

&gt;""Across 51 locations, the median COVID-19 infection fatality rate was 0.27% (corrected 0.23%)""

Read the paper more carefully.  

""the rate was
0.09% in locations with COVID-19 population mortality rates less than the global average
(&lt; 118 deaths/million), 0.20% in locations with 118–500 COVID-19 deaths/million people
and **0.57% in locations with &gt; 500 COVID-19 deaths/million people.**""  US is in this category.  

&gt;Primarily because of study after study since the beginning has shown that infections exceed cases, and the results almost always fall in the same range of 5 to 20 times. Here is another:

&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18272-4

""We estimate the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in each U.S. state from February 28 to April 18, 2020""  Again, this is back to when we didn't have readily available testing.  And again, North Dakota did not have a large first wave.  They had a wave during a period where testing was readily available.  During that wave, they tested 25% of their population on average 2 times.  They've ran a total of 1.4 million tests, twice their population.  And since the beginning of the pandemic, they've tested roughly 50% of their total population.

&gt;And also in how it unfolded and how the numbers were reported once testing began. At first every case was a severe case because nobody knew what was going on, so the number of cases was small and the fatality rate was very high.

North Dakota didn't have a large first wave so most of the rest of this paragraph is moot as it relates to what we're actually talking about here.

&gt;Combine this with antibody test results which show the same 5-15 times number of people have antibodies in a region than are reported cases and I think the argument is further supported. And also the IFR studies I cited.

Again, North Dakota's antibody testing results (i.e. serological testing) shows 10.7% of the population has antibodies.  That's LESS than the number of cases.  Your argument is not supported by the evidence that comes directly from North Dakota.  

&gt;I don't think we can conclude that they have reached any herd immunity threshold but I think the infection rate is far higher than the case count.

There's just no data that supports it being significantly higher.  Not the positivity rate, not the math of it, and not the serological testing.  

&gt;Testing is done by testing a specific population or by people self-selecting to get tested and so is inherently biased. 

It's biased toward those that may have had a contact or are experiencing symptoms.  That increases the chance of there being a positive case, not decreases it.  You're going the wrong way from what you want your argument to be.

&gt; In one area they might be testing health care workers and in another it could be a ramp-up of drive-by testing of the general population.

Again, during this wave, North Dakota tested 25% of their population.  Those are ""unique"" individuals.  It's hard to make an argument that there's a ton more cases out there when 25% of the population got tested on average twice during the surge.  

&gt;I absolutely agree with the thrust of that 538 article that take a case count without any context is somewhere between meaningless and complicated.

Which is why I've put it into context by using the absolute minimum size of the population and why I've brought serological testing into the picture which shows that nowhere near 3x the population has antibodies against the virus.  And even their antibody testing is biased toward people that believe they had SARS-CoV-2 at some point in time.  

All in all, it just makes no sense to claim without any evidence to support it, that North Dakota has had anywhere from 3-7.2x more cases than they have had.  I'm giving you data from the state itself.  I'm running numbers based on the state's data.  I'm not going by some abstract ""Oh, we're going to apply this factor because that's how it was early on when we didn't have testing.""  I'm looking at the period of time between September to now.  What applied in February, March, and April does not apply now that testing is readily available and North Dakota has most certainly taken advantage of that testing given how much of their population they've tested.",,,1610392971,{},giwzs1g,False,t3_kukz3t,False,True,t1_giwvenh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kukz3t/north_dakota_sees_no_new_deaths_due_to_covid19/giwzs1g/,1610445349,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Point me to something I said that was factually incorrect.  I'll wait.

You have differing opinions than me on things, therefore you think it's BS.  It's not.  They are opinions.  You literally said factually incorrect things ""They are starting to throw out.""  No, they aren't, no one has started to throw out anything because it's been sitting on the shelf for too long.

&gt; The fact that the vaccine needs to be targeted is moot

It's not.  We send 1000 doses to a hospital.  Only 500 of the people there want it.  We now need to move it to the next set of people and/or let the next set of people know they need to come.

Oh, and we didn't actually know how many leftover doses we'd have until 2-3 weeks later because we didn't want to knock out 1/3 of our staff all in the same week with side effects because we are being walloped by a pandemic.

Again, you're going based on the pre-virus baseline.  You need to go by the newly established baseline which would be the months leading up to the outbreak.

I have seen studies in the 5-15 times range, that last one as high as 80. There were antibody studies in certain states that showed 4-6 times as many infections as cases.

It makes sense because a lot of people are asymptomatic and a vast majority do not get sick. There are also studies that show that the antibodies last 4-8 months. So the antibody studies may actually underestimate the actual number of infections.

&gt;When people describe prostitution as being something that is glamorous, elegant, like in the story of Pretty Woman, well that doesn't come close to it. A prostitute might sleep with five strangers a day. Across a year, that's more than 1,800 men she's having sexual intercourse or oral sex with. These are not relationships, no-one's bringing me any flowers here, trust me on that. They're using my body like a toilet.

&gt;And the johns - the clients - are violent. I've been shot five times, stabbed 13 times. I don't know why those men attacked me, all I know is that society made it comfortable for them to do so. They brought their anger or mental illness or whatever it was and they decided to wreak havoc on a prostitute, knowing I couldn't go to the police and if I did I wouldn't be taken seriously. [link](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33113238)

Also, about calling it ""sex work""...

&gt;The most effective way to brush over a terrible human rights abuse is to rename it. A pro-slavery strategist in the West Indies once suggested that instead of ‘slaves’, the ‘negroes’ should be called ‘assistant planters’. Then, he said, ‘we shall not then hear such violent outcries against the slave trade by pious divines, tender-hearted poetesses and short-sighted politicians’. The term ‘sex worker’ is just such a convenient gloss.

&gt;It was Barack Obama who said that human trafficking should be renamed ‘modern slavery’, so as to highlight the appalling conditions people were living in. [link](https://archive.is/BoPxJ)

Needs of Prostituted Women

&gt;Eighty-nine percent of 854 people in prostitution from nine countries told us that they wanted to escape prostitution, but 75% needed a home or safe place, 76% needed job training, 61% needed health care, 56% needed individual counseling, 51% needed peer support, 51% needed legal assistance, and 47% needed drug/alcohol treatment.

&gt;When you say you want to offer us assistance, we say, 'We want real jobs, not blowjobs.' Housing, better welfare rates, more job training, education opportunities without the risk of being cut off welfare. We want more detox beds and real opportunities for the women still out there. We need better exiting programs. Not a brothel so the millionaire white men who come for 2010 Olympics can have better access to violence against women.

A team of experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) will be present in China starting Thursday, January 14, in order to investigate the origin of the coronavirus.  This was reported by the Beijing National Health Commission, exactly one year after the news of the first death in China due to Covid-19.

 The National Health Commission itself has made it known, in a statement, that the WHO international team will be composed of 10 experts who ""will conduct joint research in cooperation on the origins of Covid-19 together with Chinese scientists"".  The mission will be composed of scientists of different nationalities (Denmark, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Australia, Russia, Vietnam, Germany, United States, Qatar and Japan) recognized in their countries and in the various fields of expertise.  They should travel to Wuhan, where the first Covid victim was announced on 11 January 2020 and the first city in the world to be quarantined on 23 January 2020. The investigation and research by experts should last from five to five.  six weeks.
 The agreements on the investigation
 This mission, agency sources explain, had already been planned for a long time, so much so that it was expected in the middle of last week, but surprisingly, the definitive go-ahead had not arrived from Beijing, despite some WHO experts were traveling  they had even already landed in China, so much so that the WHO director, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, had expressed himself quite critically, saying he was ""very disappointed"" by the evolution of events.  In response, the local foreign ministry reported that the delays in the operation were not ""just a matter of visas"".  The talks, spokeswoman Hua Chunying reported, were continuing ""on the specific date and specific organization of the expert group's visit"".  The question of finding the origin of the coronavirus ""is incredibly complicated"", Hua stressed, explaining that ""to ensure that the work of the team of international experts in China goes smoothly, we must carry out the necessary procedures and make relevant agreements"".  Last Saturday, the number two of the National Health Commission, Zeng Yixin, had then reiterated Beijing's full cooperation, guaranteeing the willingness to host the WHO team of experts, saying during a press conference that the parties were defining the latest  details for the start of the mission and specifying that he had had ""four meetings"" on the subject, through talks that took place via video link.
 The latest data from China
 Meanwhile, China, just yesterday, recorded 103 new cases of Covid-19, signaling triple-digit growth for the first time in over five months.

[Here, for example, is the case of Newcastle, UK](https://i.imgur.com/AbT8yTS.png), showing the sum of cases for the trailing 7 days, by age group. In Newcastle, university students at Newcastle and Northumbria Universities  make up somewhere around 1/3 of the 15-19 age category during term time (University starts at age 19. Tested positive COVID cases in this age category peaked at 8400 / 100,000 **per week** shortly after universities opened in the fall and all the students went back.  Total rate of 13,616 cases / 100,000 people (13.6% of the people in that age group tested positive) for the first three weeks of October. As a comparison point, the total (tested positive) COVID cases in the USA as a whole **for the entire pandemic** is only 6900 / 100,000.   


We can assume the majority of those positive cases were of university students moving into close-packed living arrangements in university residences on the basis of time correlation, the fact that there were no other spikes for age groups over 25, and by university data of self-reported COVID test results to the university (Newcastle University for instance had 2000 reported student cases during these three weeks, and this self-reporting likely misses some positive tests). This would basically imply that around 30-40% of the 18-19 year old university students in the two universities tested positive during those three weeks. And given that there are usually 1-2 untested COVID cases for every positive test results (asymptomatic people or low-symptom people who didn't get tested), it's actually likely that something more like 60 - 100% of the 18-19 year old students at these two universities caught COVID during those three weeks.

The upshot is that for every sick person that presents as a case there are many people that are not cases but instead are asymptomatic or only mildly ill such that they do not see a doctor.

Well, yeah  O:-)  I don't remember which MaxFun show it was, but there was one live performance, some years back, of one of the myriad McElroy Bros podcasts, maybe it was MBMBaM. The MC introduced each of the McElroy bros, and the crowd cheered. And they introduced the other two McElroy wives, Rachel and Theresa, and the crowd cheered. And at some point they introduced Sydnee, and I swear she drew the loudest cheers, louder even than the three brothers

I wasn't very into Sawbones at that point, but after I heard that live show, I was like ""**who** was this rockstar of the bunch?"" And then I went back and started listening to most if not all of the Sawbones back catalog. And what I heard is this warm, friendly medical professional doling out this very informed perspective in a highly sensible manner

I mean, clearly Sydnee has a great mind, because hello, medical degree. but she also has a great heart, given that she fell for a silly billy like Justin, years before he garnered fame &amp; fortune in the podcasting world. She saw who he could be, and helped him get there

anyway, I'm just a big fan. not least of which the way that Syd and Justin weave in their perspective living in semi-rural WV. often medical pros work from (and assume) a big-city perspective with near-limitless resources. and Dr. Syd is over at Sawbones going ""mmmmm, yeah, now lemme tell ya how that works for us out in the hinterlands""",,,1610381100,{},giw7hag,False,t3_kuosm9,False,True,t1_givw0c3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/kuosm9/why_west_virginias_winning_the_race_to_get/giw7hag/,1610429992,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
