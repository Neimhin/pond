Because people don't think about these, they don't realise that COVID19 is no different.

People have realized the value of masks for preventing lots of diseases - flu cases have plummeted last winter for example - and how this helps to prevent 10,000+ (in the UK) flu deaths each year, so they may well become more common in crowded conditions such as public transport. Certainly many people will voluntarily wear them.

The far more likely outcome is a recommended yearly booster shot to better protect yourself against whatever new variants are around at that time. Everyone will have moved on aside from those unvaccinated, and in their case they might face serious problems if and when they get infected. And they likely will eventually get it because of how transmissible the disease is - and at that point their fate is up in the air.

First, there is no need to trust the government (I personally consider them my enemy) to know that Sputnik is safe enough and works, there is enough independent evidence from vaccinated people in Russia and from other countries like Argentina. It is not a jank vaccine. My own case is not evidence, but I checked the antibodies level after vaccination, and both I and my family members developed a very high level of antibodies. Second, the risks of COVID are so high that vaccinating with anything should be an obvious choice when there's no alternative. At worst, vaccines are useless.

Well, as I say, looks like we're about to run the experiment so we'll see.

But, again as I keep saying but seems to be difficult to get through, it isn't 'everyone'.  I'm sure there's a great many people who will quite happily be back in crowded bars helping us up to out 200,000 daily infections just fine. Indeed that's what I'm counting on for this scenario.

The issue is if the percentage of people of people who will not return to 'hospitality' when infections are running at 200,000 a day is greater than the profit margin of 'hospitality'.  If you order 10 barrels of beer because you expect we're returning to normal and you only sell 8 before the expiry date because **just** 20% of your customers stayed away you made a loss.

Maybe you're not used to business, but the first x from y customers don't give you x/y profit, they cover fixed costs - or don't, it's the last y-x which make your profit.

But there are still likely to be many red countries and they may change regularly with seasons and variants.

That's the situation likely to still exist for another 3-5 years.  

NZ has not yet decided what strategy we will follow once the vaccination campaign is done.  It may be mitigation as used for flu, or it may be elimination, as used for measles.

Of the ones you listed only Spain has said it will vaccinate 12-17 year olds. Unless all those countries change their minds and vaccinate the 12-17 group they will have to vaccinate a higher proportion of their 18-59 group to compensate.  

How much more?

Coronavirus isn't going to disappear, but at some point we have to accept this as yet another endemic infectious disease that is largely just dangerous to those who still refused to get a vaccine (let's set aside the developing countries who don't yet have access to a vaccine for now). 

The flu causes thousands and thousands of deaths in a normal year, and yet nobody bats an eye at it or suggests that we need to impose lockdowns to control spread.

The Centre is due to open in December 2021.

Expansion and acceleration of theconstruction of the¬†Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre¬†for the mass production of vaccines. Under construction in Oxfordshire and due to open soon, this will have facilities to produce and package a range of different vaccine types.

Establishing an interim¬†rapid deployment manufacturing facility¬†in Oxford Biomedica‚Äôs labs, which was approved for vaccine production in October 2020.

A joint investment with the biotech company Valneva to¬†upgrade and expand an existing facility¬†in West Lothian. The facility is due to produce up to 200 m doses of inactivated whole virus vaccines in 2021.

Securing capacity¬†with Thermo Fisher in Swindon and Wockhardt in Wrexham, to carry out ‚Äòfill and finish‚Äô, which involves dispensing the vaccine into vials ready for distribution.

Developing¬†‚ÄòCentres for Advanced Therapies Training and Skills‚Äô: facilities and online training to provide industry-standard skills, including in vaccine manufacture.

Funding the¬†Centre of Process Innovation¬†in Darlington to develop facilities for producing vaccines using new RNA-based technology (see ‚ÄòRNA-based vaccines‚Äô below) that comply with¬†good manufacturing practice.

Not only that, but there is growing evidence, beyond just this one article, that vaccine efficacy is lower agains the Delta variant than previously thought.

Even though the data from Israel is considered ""preliminary"" it is in fact the latest data we have. Even prior to this coming out, efficacy was proven to be below 90% for symptomatic covid, and Israel's data is real world data from a county that has fully re-opened. 

Dr. Fauci and other public health experts and doctors (and even organizations like the WHO) advise wearing masks even if you are vaccinated due to the risks associated with the Delta variant.

I'm lukewarm on that prediction and could probably be convinced otherwise, but my take is...

Contrary to what you'll often see posted on here regarding ""cases don't matter"", there will always be a conversion ratio between cases and hospitalizations/deaths. Vaccines drive that ratio down, but don't eliminate it altogether. There's no situation where tracking (and where appropriate, managing) the leading indicator is inappropriate.

The million dollar question here is *to what degree* the current state of the vaccination campaign in the UK has pushed that ratio down. For example, if the old ratio of hospitalizations to cases was 1:10 and vaccines have changed that to 1:100, this gamble will pay off and reward people with a couple months of additional freedom. On the other hand, if vaccinations have pushed the ratio to 1:20 or 1:30, that won't be enough to counter the increased R value of the delta variant absent public health measures, and you'll see another hospital crunch.

I completely agree with Boris that at some point, we just have to live with COVID as a society. The issue is that dropping all restrictions while the vaccination campaign is still far from complete while cases are soaring in the face of a much more infectious variant is not an opportune time.

Based on poor messaging and constant flip flopping by the CDC, I have chosen to rely less on what the CDC Director says in interviews and more on the fine print on their website and on ongoing research studies. 

The CDC's focus right now seems to be to make sure hospitals aren't overwhelmed, so their messaging is going to be focused on whatever needs to be said to get more people vaccinated. They aren't concerned about nuances regarding vaccine efficacy or the fact that some people may get the vaccine and still be hospitalized given that this is rare. And they are even *less* concerned about long haul covid or any post covid health issues right now. 

If you look at what experts have been saying, it seems like long covid isn't being tracked well among the unvaccinated, and definitely not among the vaccinated.

Now it seems that the asymptomatic infection rate may not be negligible even for the fully vaccinated people when there are delta outbreaks. This is in my opinion as to why Israel is reconsidering its indoor mask mandate.

In the US the infection rate is still very low. There are reports of localized outbreaks in MO and some other parts of the country. But in general the life is almost back to normal.

I wonder if the delta variant would indeed cause a strong surge in some parts of the country where the vaccination rate is low. If so, I wonder what the state and federal government would do to remedy the situation. Hopefully any safety measures will be more appropriate and timely than what we all witnessed last year.

[],,amoebaD,,,[],,,,text,t2_56w0o,False,False,[],"&gt; A mild COVID-19 case with prior vaccination is not the same thing as a mild COVID-19 case without prior vaccination. So the rough odds there are very likely nowhere near where they actually are post full vaccination.

Agreed, I just think my crude calculation accounted for this (mostly). Using the 64% protection number significantly decreased the odds of getting COVID of any severity, and thus lowered that 72% number when multiplying probabilities (also, I used a conservative study - another showed only 51% fully recovered their sense of smell after a month). Granted, 64% may not be the right number to use. We know Pfizer protects very well against death/hospitalizations from Delta, and perhaps we should think of long covid as a ""medium"" outcome, between death/hospitalization and mild disease. This is all speculation but maybe using the average of those two estimates would make more sense this instance. We're kind of flying blind here until we learn: a) what the disease severity data is for breakthrough cases (more granulated than hospitalized vs. not) and b) whether breakthrough cases of *identical short-term severity* to non-vaxxed cases progress differently when it comes specifically to long covid. 

1/1000 isn't ""vanishingly small odds"" in my opinion. That may be a good estimate (research on long term anosmia is very lacking so far, but I'm sure it's a much smaller number than the ""medium term"" anosmia numbers available), but it's hard to say. I likely had a low probability of experiencing it before, and a lower one now with the protection of the vaccine. But with many accounts of this symptom with mild disease, and now many accounts of mild breakthrough cases (yes, including fever, shortness of breath and all the nastiness of mild covid), It's not an infinitesimal risk. 

Don't get me wrong, I'd LOVE if the vaccines protected against long-covid just as well as they protect against death/hospitalization. But I haven't seen any evidence to that point and my understanding of long covid's pathophysiology makes me think protection against it (relative to the baseline low % of long covid in unvaxxed) will be closer to the vaccine's protection % against infection and mild covid.

Getting sick sucks. Losing your sense of smell sucks. Even if I have a &lt;20% of getting more than the sniffles if exposed to Delta, why not protect myself? Wearing a mask while I'm shopping at Costco doesn't lower my quality of life at all. On the other hand, wearing a mask while hanging out with friends at my house would. So I don't. It's lower risk since I know the vax status of who I'm with, and I know that they're healthy. Is it no risk? No, but the small risk in these instances isn't worth the nuisance of a mask. Every situation is different. And I also keep up with case #s in my area because that changes the calculation as well. 

Not sure why you brought up international travel. I'm not disapproving if that's what you think. International travel always has been and always will be a risk for communicable diseases, but the individual risk isn't any different than being in a comparable indoor space (unless you decide to travel to a hot zone lol). I've gone on a couple flights since being vaxxed and felt very safe. Definitely looking forward to more trips in my future as well. There's a lot of ""mitigations"" that are incredibly disruptive and for most people aren't worth it once they have the protection of the vax. But for me at least, wearing a mask in public isn't one of them. And given the small but not insignificant risk of mild, symptomatic covid (and the smaller risk of long term complications), it's an easy call for me.",,,1625531953,{},h46p8l5,False,t3_oe46gq,False,True,t1_h46dhzz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oe46gq/israel_sees_decline_in_pfizer_vaccine_efficacy/h46p8l5/,1625741459,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Nobody ever said zero covid. But there is such a thing as: a) waiting until kids get vaccinated, b) increasing vaccination % to get closer to herd immunity, c) ensuring vaccines are as effective as possible and d)more research on long covid post vaccination.

The **initial goal was to reduce hospital capacity. That doesn't mean that is the only goal. We also didn't know until recently the impact of long covid and that was therefore not the focus until this year. Obviously, deaths are a priority. That doesn't mean that chronic long term health effects should be ignored.**

What I am sensing from you is that you are very uneducated about how prevalent and serious long haul covid is. You may be one of the types of people that actually needs to experience it yourself to understand. I know someone that went through it (as is still suffering) after a very mild case. 

**Keep in mind: you are not God.** Your opinion does not trump anyone else's. And NOBODY knows *anything* for sure right now. Research on nearly *everything* is ongoing and there is a lot we still need to learn.

There are many public health experts and organizations warning that a vaccine is not quite the end all be all to this and that we still need to be cautious, *especially* in areas where vaccination rates are low or where this higher spread of covid. **You seem to believe that you just know better than all of these experts, including Dr. Fauci and others.

No it doesn't and no it isn't. You have precisely zero guarantee that even a small viral load won't get your kid sick, and if it's small enough that their immune system cleans it up immediately before the virus can start to replicate it probably won't leave any immunity.

And vaccines in the past were made by killing or deactivating viruses (=taking away their ability to replicate), not by just giving you a small amount of them.  
If all it took was to inoculate you a small enough amount of virus it would take days to make a vaccine, not months or years.

[],,Odd_Science,,,[],,,,text,t2_1cljtskv,False,False,[],"I still completely fail to see how advocating (or even mandating) masks has any negative effect at all on vaccination. Those are completely complementary and independent measures. It's also likely much easier to get vaccinated people to wear masks than getting unvaccinated people vaccinated (because in the US to be in the latter category you have to be an idiot and an asshole, in Europe and the rest of the world it just means you're still waiting).

Also, it's much easier to enforce a mask mandate if it applies to everyone. In fact, if vaccinated people are exempt it becomes basically impossible to enforce.

I'm in favour of mandating the vaccine, but that's a completely independent issue. Whether mandating the vaccine is legally and socially possible has nothing to do with mask wearing.

And all that talk about ""if I still have to wear a mask why would I even get the vaccine"": is it really not enough motivation to avoid getting a terrible disease and possibly killing your grandma?

Sure, the great majority of breakthrough infections in the vaccinated result in mild cases. But Long Covid and other health complications are not limited to severe cases, many people with only mild symptoms develop it too. If there's only a weak association between the severity of the illness and risk of Long Covid, why should we assume that breakthrough infections in the vaccinated won't produce Long Covid?

Of the new cases, 27 were domestic transmissions and two were imported. It was the lowest daily total recorded in Taiwan since May 14, CECC data showed.

Among the domestic cases, 14 were recorded in Taipei, 11 in New Taipei, and one each in Pingtung and Changhua counties, according to the data.

The new Delta variant case in Pingtung County, meanwhile, brought the number of infections in the cluster in southern Taiwan to 17, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (Èô≥ÊôÇ‰∏≠) said at a CECC press briefing.

The new patient most likely contracted the disease while having tea on June 20 with an unlicensed taxi driver, who was the first confirmed domestic case in the Pingtung cluster, Chen said.

The Delta variant outbreak started with two imported cases -- a woman and her grandson who had returned to Taiwan from Peru on June 6, according to the CECC.

Meanwhile, Chen said, genome sequencing carried out in outbreaks at markets in Taipei's Wanhua District has confirmed that those cases were caused by the Alpha variant and therefore not related to the Pingtung cluster
Among Tuesday's tally, the sources of infection have been identified in 17 cases, while 10 are under investigation, the CECC said.

The two imported cases were Taiwanese nationals who recently returned from the United States and Indonesia, it said.

The deaths reported were 14 men and three women, who passed away between June 28 and July 5, the CECC said.

To date, 706 people in Taiwan have died of COVID-19, including 694 since May 15.

Japan will send 1.13 million more doses to Taiwan on Thursday, Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi told reporters at a regular press conference, after previously delivering 1.24 million doses last month.

A further 1 million doses each will be sent to Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam this week, following earlier donations to Indonesia and Malaysia, Motegi said.

""True friends always lend a hand when they need each other the most,"" Taiwanese Premier Su Tseng-chang wrote on his Facebook page.

In further good news for Taiwan's vaccine programme, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung told reporters in Taipei that 620,000 additional AstraZeneca doses would arrive on Wednesday, part of the government's direct order from the company.

Around 10% of Taiwan's 23.5 million people have received at least one of the two-shot vaccines. President Tsai Ing-wen said on Tuesday officials hope to get that to up to 25% by the end of this month.

Japan has arranged to buy 120 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine, with most of that supply produced by domestic companies. Regulators approved the shot in May, but amid lingering concerns about blood clots, health authorities have relied on the mRNA-type vaccines made by Pfizer Inc¬†(PFE.N)¬†and Moderna Inc¬†(MRNA.O)¬†in Japan's inoculation push.

Japan has pledged $1 billion and 30 million doses to the global vaccine sharing scheme COVAX, but so far its donations have been outside of that programme.

AstraZeneca doses produced in Japan have not yet been approved by the World Health Organisation for use in COVAX, Motegi said, so the country has turned to bilateral deals to respond to ""urgent requests for vaccine supplies.""

Japan's first shipments through the COVAX facility are expected in the middle of this month, with some 11 million doses bound for nations in south Asia and the Pacific islands, Motegi said.

[],,polit1337,,,[],,,,text,t2_7wkp1,False,False,[],"&gt; It's also likely much easier to get vaccinated people to wear masks than getting unvaccinated people vaccinated (because in the US to be in the latter category you have to be an idiot and an asshole, in Europe and the rest of the world it just means you're still waiting).

Again, getting vaccinated people to wear masks only has a very small effect on controlling the spread, for the reason that I stated.  The vaccines have already almost taken vaccinated people out of the equation.

&gt; Also, it's much easier to enforce a mask mandate if it applies to everyone. In fact, if vaccinated people are exempt it becomes basically impossible to enforce.

I also stated above that I can (and do) support this until kids, at least, have had the opportunity to get the vaccine.

&gt; And all that talk about ""if I still have to wear a mask why would I even get the vaccine"": is it really not enough motivation to avoid getting a terrible disease and possibly killing your grandma? What kind of sociopath do you have to be to say ""I don't care about reducing transmission of a deadly disease and I will only contribute if you pay me by removing the minor nuisance of having to wear a light piece of cloth""?

I never said any of this, so don't strawman me.  I got vaccinated the day I was eligible, months ago, and still haven't taken my mask off.

However, once basically everyone is eligible for the shot, I am in favor of removing the mask mandate and making it a personal choice.  Over 99% of deaths at this point are people who are making the choice to *not* get vaccinated.  They are doing much more to put the vulnerable at risk than a vaccinated person ever will.

I don't have a link, and am not OP, but I don't think it sounds wrong. You just have to consider the numbers in context.  Here are the back-of-the-envelope calculations.

The vaccines are estimated (by Public Health England) to be ~90% effective against symptomatic disease from the delta variant.

That leaves 10% for breakthrough infections.  If 30% of that 10% ends up in the hospital, that gives the vaccine a 97% efficacy rate against hospitalization, which is actually a little *better* than what it is presumed to be for the delta variant.

People go into lockdown whole a vaccine is being researched now. It cuts the growth rates in half.  
Now, both viruses are declining in population, but unknown virus V is declining more rapidly.   

Then the vaccine is deployed, and it cuts the rate of spread of virus A in half, but has no effect on virus B. Due to the vaccination effort, restrictions are totally eased!  
Now virus A has a growth rate of 0.75, and virus B has a growth rate of 1.1, meaning virus B will become dominant eventually.

Israel data which is a massive dataset:

‚ÄúSimilarly, the overall estimated level of protection from prior SARS-CoV-2 infection for documented infection is 94¬∑8% (CI:[94¬∑4, 95¬∑1]); hospitalization 94¬∑1% (CI:[91¬∑9, 95¬∑7]); and severe illness 96¬∑4% (CI:[92¬∑5, 98¬∑3]). Our results question the need to vaccinate previously-infected individuals.‚Äù

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.20.21255670v1

Cleveland Clinic study:

‚ÄúConclusions:

Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who have not been infected before.‚Äù

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176v2.full.pdf

Siren Study released in April:

‚Äúprevious infection reduced the incidence of infection by at least 90% (aIRR 0¬∑07, 95% CI 0¬∑06 to 0¬∑10) and even when we included all possible and probable reinfections reduced the incidence of reinfection by at least 84% (aIRR 0¬∑159, 0¬∑13‚Äì0¬∑19).‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have shown in this analysis that immunity from previous infection is protective against reinfection with the B.1.1.7 variant.‚Äù

All data  points to long term immunity, study published in Nature, Peer Reviewed:

‚ÄúOverall, our results indicate that mild infection with SARS-CoV-2 induces robust antigen-specific, long-lived humoral immune memory in humans.‚Äù

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03647-4

Immunity is long lasting potentially improved by Vaccination:

‚ÄúIn the absence of vaccination antibody reactivity to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, neutralizing activity and the number of RBD-specific memory B cells remain relatively stable from 6 to 12 months. ‚Äú

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.07.443175v1.abstract

Variants still neutralized by natural or vaccine induced T Cell reactivity:

‚ÄúOverall, the results demonstrate that CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in convalescent COVID-19 subjects or COVID-19 mRNA vaccinees are not substantially affected by mutations found in the SARS-CoV-2 variants.‚Äù

No problem.

&gt; I still think an interval of 57% to 85% protection against hospitalization could mean 43% of all people with only one dose in hospitals.

The important thing to remember is that this doesn‚Äôt mean 15-43% of single-dosed people will end up in hospital ‚Äì it means that there will be a *reduction* of 57-85% from whatever the baseline rate is. 

By July 19th, second doses should be close to done for the over 40s, so we‚Äôll mainly be looking at the younger age groups (who have a much lower hospitalisation risk). The hospitalisation risk **if diagnosed with COVID-19** is approximately as follows:

Age|Hospitalisation risk (male)|Hospitalisation risk (female)
:-:|:-:|:-:
20|0.9%|0.6%
30|2.7%|1.7%
40|4.8%|3.1%

[Source for those numbers](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/covid-pandemic-mortality-risk-estimator).

After a vaccine that was 57-85% effective against hospitalisation, those numbers would come down to:

Age|Hospitalisation risk (male)|Hospitalisation risk (female)
:-:|:-:|:-:
20|0.14‚Äî0.39%|0.09‚Äî0.26%
30|0.41‚Äî1.16%|0.26‚Äî0.73%
40|0.72‚Äî2.06%|0.46‚Äî1.33%

A possible caveat on this is that [Delta may cause 1.85x the hospitalisations per case](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(21\)01358-1/fulltext) as the Alpha variant. But considering that many of these people won't even catch the virus in the first place (at least not in the 8-week window before they're due for their 2nd dose), it seems that only a small minority of young 1-dosed individuals are likely to be hospitalised.

Unless a country vaccinates literally everyone, which, let's face it, nowhere including NZ will achieve that, you are going to have a high enough prevalence of the virus in basically every country that a wave will eventually hit NZ unless they keep up quarantine for everyone. 

It only takes one vaccinated, but infectious, person to show up in a country with around 20% unvaccinated for Delta, or similar future variants with that level of transmissibility, to rip through the community. As you say, if that happens, under current plans NZ is hamstrung to have to close the border, lock down until community transmission is 0 again, then debate opening up the border again.

Essentially, most experts seem to think covid will be circulating in most places forever now, just not causing much worse illness than a bad cold in most people due to vaccination. I'm at a loss how a country that has committed to ""zero"" covid is going to maintain that whilst reengaging with the rest of the world, without the virus magically disappearing any time soon.

Obviously it's highly state-dependent, but my point is that at a national level UK Tories are today overwhelmingly in favour of all of the above, and their US counterparts for the most part really aren't. Of course we can identify outliers like good old Arnie, but the general worldview in the US is substantially more conservative just on the basis of the above. Maybe that's a superficial popular impression, but at the very least I think many would agree with me, even if it's more nuanced than we think.

Could antivaxxers in the US still cause some parts in the country to be a breeding ground? Yeah, to a degree. But nothing compared to the likes of India, Brazil, etc since those countries are densely populated and don't have high vaccination rates, thus meaning the sickness flowing around more easily, thus giving it more opportunities to create variants.

The FDA takes time to make a full approval, and even when it does, I doubt it will change many minds as some will believe that it's just a ""conspiracy."" We could try to do things like taking away health insurance from those who don't want to get the vaccine and don't have a valid medical reason to, but that also could lead into some major problems if one person has a terrible reaction to the vaccine but survives and is disabled, and takes the country to court.

 polio was dropping mainly from proper sanitation; which we all know. But if you look at the numbers was it really such an endemic when less then 1% ( 0.04% ) resulted in paralysis. 99% had full recovery. There's also a major correlation between DDT use &amp; polio. 

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/polio.html

Do Google scearch on - reclassified disease polio-
 You see right on the top ( I can't believe this hasn't been censored yet) that 90% of cases were eradicated , just by changing the definition and how you were diagnosed. The ineffective vaccines it clearly states : this data comes from thebmj. 
Also read how 80% of smallpox cases came from vaccinated people. This report doesn't touch on the fact that the vaccinated people were shedding smallpox as well as the polio vaccinated. I can provide link when I have more time

Then scearch- the cutter incident- how the polio vaccine gave polio to tens of thousands. Let's speculate for a moment at how many of those cases we just lumped into wild polio to keep the need for a vaccine. But this starts the idea that what we've been told isn't all true.

Then scearch- polio has been renamed-  you'll find Guillain Barre, transverse myelitis &amp; MS; just to name a few.
Yes you'll see conflicting websites saying this isn't true but that data come from medical  journals.

I believe 1979 was the last case of wild polio in the Americas but how can we take that seriously when we can see how the parameters were changed. 
More people get polio from the vaccine then wild polio, around 50K a year. Acute flaccid paralysis it's called but it can't be polio since you were vaccinated even though it has the same symptoms and since there wasn't any polio cultures in the stools it's not considered polio. -- if it quacks like a duck --

We need to start asking ourselves if diseases like polio have a 99% recovery rate, along with measles ,covid and many more. Are these really deadly or should we look at what was wrong with the 1% who died?! 

We all like to believe vaccinations are totally safe , but let's be aware that no vaccine is study for there nonspecific effect, (at least not by the pharmaceutical industry who holds all the cards). Independent &amp; observational research is demonstrating major health issues. 

The only way she was allowed to share this data was by praising the polio vaccine, which after a little reading you'll see is false, if you're interested keep digging and change key words 'you'll be amazed at the results.

But the vaccines weren't really created to stop any infection, that's a bonus. 

And, variants aside, efficacy against infection is probably harder to measure than efficacy against severe disease, since whether you get infected depends so much on how many precautions the people around you are taking.

There are other studies that show different results from the Israeli MoH, but I think we need at least to be prepared for the idea that herd immunity will remain a moving target and we need to shift to arguing how much spread we're willing to tolerate if most of the cases (but never all) aren't severe.

If there's a bright side to this, it may help expose why holding out for the ""best"" vaccine is futile.

The world has seen disease before and this certainly isn't the first time its hit the world is a bad way. We have gotten past things before and I am sure this is no exception. So I can see people wanting to move on with life and stop wanting to take so many precautions. Its hard to change our way of living as a society so drastically in a short amount of time.

On the other hand I can see why many people wouldn't want to just ""Live with it"". Many people have died from this horrible disease and many others now live with the side of effect of getting the disease and recovering (My husband still has lung problems from catching the virus). Its hard to move past something that has done so much destruction. 

Honestly I think people are torn between the two sides of the subject and that's something that probably wont change any time soon. Having access to the internet and being able to see everything live makes it very easy for everyone to have an opinion on the subject. 

My hope is that we can find a solid middle ground that will make people happy. Tragedy always leaves its mark on things and we always add new ""rules"" to try and make sure it doesn't happen again.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a health crisis with unprecedented repercussions for human rights and economic development globally, including in human trafficking. COVID-19 generated conditions that increased the number of people who experienced vulnerabilities to human trafficking and interrupted existing and planned anti-trafficking interventions. Governments across the world diverted resources toward the pandemic, often at the expense of anti-trafficking efforts, resulting in decreased protection measures and service provision for victims, reduction of preventative efforts, and hindrances to investigations and prosecutions of traffickers. At the same time, human traffickers quickly adapted to capitalize on the vulnerabilities exposed and exacerbated by the pandemic.

Despite the significant disruptions to efforts to combat this crime, the anti-trafficking community found ways to adapt and forged new relationships to overcome the challenges. Some governments and organizations conducted in-depth assessments to identify the changing trends. Others leveraged technology to drive innovative solutions. Many aligned policies and practices to current realities. Nonetheless, the challenges uncovered by COVID-19 are monumental and may be long lasting, requiring sustained collaboration among governments, civil society organizations, private sector leaders, survivor leaders, and other anti-trafficking actors to adjust and respond aptly to overcome these challenges. As a result, this year‚Äôs TIP Report introduction highlights human trafficking issues related to COVID-19, with special focus on how anti-trafficking stakeholders adapted in rapidly changing environments. It reflects on the lessons learned from practitioners and offers considerations to rebuild momentum through coordinated anti-trafficking strategies. The introduction also illustrates collaborative ways to reimagine anti-trafficking efforts with an emphasis on preparedness to prevent compounding effects of future crises on trafficking victims and vulnerable individuals, as well as efforts to combat the most recent emerging human trafficking trends.

**CHANGING HUMAN TRAFFICKING TRENDS AMID THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC**

*A Growing Number of People Experiencing Economic and Social Vulnerabilities*

The economic and social distress generated by the pandemic and related mitigation efforts exacerbated risks for vulnerable and marginalized populations. These included women and children, people affected by travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders, communities in areas of food insecurity, and survivors of trafficking, as well as persons directly and indirectly affected by the disruption of economic activities and reduced livelihood options. Due to school closures, some children lacked access to education, shelter, and/or food. Survivors of trafficking faced an increased risk of potential re-victimization due to financial and emotional hardships during the crisis. A survey by the Office of Security and Co-operation in Europe‚Äôs OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and UN Women highlights that almost 70 percent of trafficking survivors from 35 countries reported that their financial well-being was heavily impacted by COVID-19, and more than two-thirds attributed a decline in their mental health to government-imposed lockdowns triggering memories of exploitative situations. Many survivors had to close shops or leave jobs due to lockdowns and some were pressured by former traffickers when other employment options dried up. Some survivors had to sell their cell phones to purchase food, further isolating them from potential assistance from case workers. Additionally, COVID-19 mitigation efforts, such as stay-at-home orders and travel limitations, increased rates of gender-based violence and substance abuse, both of which put individuals at a higher risk of human traffickers exploiting them. Individuals in underserved communities faced barriers to accessing healthcare, while foreigners were stigmatized as carriers and spreaders of the virus, placing them at higher risk for exploitation and violence. Substantial changes in financial situations, such as the reduction of wages and work hours, closure of workplaces, rising unemployment, and reduced remittances, coupled with the rise in costs of living and disruptions to social safety networks, created newly precarious situations for those not previously vulnerable and even more precarious situations for those who were already at risk of exploitation.

Low-wage and migrant workers and those in the informal economy faced riskier employment conditions, including restricted movement, minimal oversight mechanisms, withheld wages, and increasing debts‚Äîall indicators or flags for human trafficking. During stay-at-home orders, workers who lived at their worksites became particularly vulnerable to sex trafficking and forced labor while being restricted in their ability to seek assistance or leave their situation of exploitation. With minimal oversight mechanisms, many of these worksites remained unmonitored, resulting in fewer opportunities for victim identification. In the Gulf States, an IST Research survey of 6,000 migrant workers concluded employers were 36 percent more likely to confine migrant domestic workers to their workplace and were 240 percent more likely to force those workers to work on rest days than any other migrant workers. In the same survey, more than 50 percent of migrant workers reported bearing new debts because of the pandemic. According to UNODC, migrant workers whose plans were disrupted by COVID-19 travel restrictions, either to travel home or to the workplace, were likely to have already paid recruitment fees or travel costs, placing them at risk of debt bondage. Similarly, a study by the Government of the Philippines also found many overseas Filipino workers were stranded with their savings exhausted during 2020. Sinking demand also led major global retailers to cancel orders and, in many cases, refuse to pay for products their supplier factories had already produced. Pennsylvania State University‚Äôs Center for Global Worker Rights and the Worker Rights Consortium reported that this resulted in shutdowns of thousands of factories in producing countries that sent home millions of factory workers, often without legally mandated pay.

**Traffickers Quickly Adapt and Exploit COVID-19-related Risks**

As COVID-19 caused a global economic downturn and increased the number of individuals vulnerable to human trafficking, traffickers adapted their existing tactics to take advantage of the unique circumstances of the pandemic. Human traffickers targeted the growing number of people unable to mitigate, adapt to, or build resilience against the worsening economic and social effects; they also exploited situations where screening and identification of victims became even more difficult. This included individuals confined to their homes or workplaces, households in dire need of financial support, and workers in the informal sector. Traffickers targeted families experiencing financial difficulties and offered false promises and fraudulent job offers to recruit their children, while other families exploited or sold their children to traffickers to financially support themselves. Business owners and landlords pressured individuals to take out loans in exchange for cheap labor or commercial sexual exploitation. Additionally, traffickers sought to re-exploit survivors who became financially unstable and vulnerable to revictimization.

Some examples include:

-In India and Nepal, young girls from poor and rural areas were often expected to leave school to help support their families during the economic hardship‚Äîsome were forced into marriage in exchange for money, while others were forced to work to supplement lost income.

-Reports from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Uruguay illustrate that landlords forced their tenants (often women) to have sex with them when the tenant could not pay rent.

- During lockdown, traffickers in the Amazon in Brazil changed their patterns by sending child sex trafficking victims to the perpetrators‚Äô private quarters or specific locations instead of the usual places where children were sold to perpetrators.

- In Haiti, Niger, and Mali, gangs operating in IDP camps took advantage of reduced security and limited protection to force residents at the camp to perform commercial sex acts.

- In Burma, families experienced drastic declines in household incomes, with 94 percent of households surveyed reporting a reduction of incomes, 81 percent reporting at least one family member losing a job, and 69 percent reporting having to take loans making these families vulnerable to trafficking.

While the number of individuals at risk of trafficking grew during the pandemic, so did the conditions under which traffickers thrive. Traffickers capitalized on the reduced capacity and shifting priorities of law enforcement resulting in greater anonymity and impunity to pursue their crimes. Disruptions to public justice systems and diversion of resources from anti-trafficking efforts during the pandemic increased impunity for traffickers and lowered the odds of their arrest.

""We have arrested doctors,"" he added. ""They were using a hospital which was producing the fake certificates, vials, syringes.""  
So far, 14 people have been arrested on suspicion of cheating, attempts at culpable homicide, criminal conspiracy, and other charges. More arrests may come as police continue investigating other people involved in the scam, Thakur said.  
India was ravaged by a second wave of coronavirus between April and early June, which infected millions and killed tens of thousands nationwide. After peaking in May, daily cases have slowly declined, easing the pressure on the strained medical system -- and allowing authorities to step up their vaccination program during the country's recovery.  
In June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a centralized vaccine drive, in which a significant proportion of doses would be provided by the central government to states for free. Soon after, the country administered a record 8 million shots in a day -- a ""gladdening"" sign of the program's acceleration, said Modi. So far, more than 62 million people -- about 4.5% of the country's population -- have been fully vaccinated, according to data by Johns Hopkins University.  
The fake vaccination drives took place between late May and early June, according to CNN affiliate CNN-News18. Authorities began investigating after some of the scam victims, suspicious of the vaccination certificates they received, reported it to police.  
One of the fake drives took place at a housing society -- but ""none of our members got any symptoms and also we had to pay in cash,"" said one resident there, according to CNN-News18. ""At that point of time, we doubted it.""  
As police began investigating, others took legal action of their own. Siddharth Chandrashekhar, a lawyer in Mumbai, filed a public interest lawsuit on June 24 -- by which point the public prosecutor had already confirmed more than 2,000 victims of the scams. The allegations are ""really shocking,"" said the Bombay High Court in the filing, urging state and local authorities to take action ""so that innocent individuals are not duped in future.""",,,1625582761,{},h48qcgq,True,t3_oewdc4,False,True,t3_oewdc4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oewdc4/thousands_thought_they_were_getting_the_covid/h48qcgq/,1625783028,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In a statement, Medigen, whose COVID-19 vaccine completed Phase 2 trials on June 9 and has since applied for emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Taiwanese authorities, said it filed the request with Paraguay's National Health Surveillance Authority (DINAVISA) early Monday.

The Phase 3 clinical trials will be conducted in cooperation with the Faculty of Medical Sciences at the National University of Asunci√≥n in the Paraguayan capital through immunobridging to compare the Medigen vaccine's overall level of protection with that of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, according to the company's statement.

In doing so, Medigen said it is hoping to collect Phase 3 clinical trial result data in Paraguay so that its vaccine can be used in Paraguay and potentially the whole of Latin America in the future.

Medigen said it is also in talks with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other international health regulatory authorities and is planning to conduct Phase 3 clinical trials in other countries.

Medigen did not provide a timetable for completion of the Phase 3 clinical trial in Paraguay.

Medigen announced on June 15 that it had filed an application with the Taiwan Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) for emergency approval of its COVID-19 vaccine, less than a week after the company unblinded the results of its Phase 2 clinical trials.

The company said the results raised no major safety concerns, and the data for generating neutralizing antibodies was generally well-received.

Taiwan FDA previously estimated that the EUA review for the Medigen vaccine could begin in early July. However, the date has been pushed back to late July the earliest due to a lack of required documentation.

Taiwan's government has signed contracts to purchase vaccines from two Taiwanese drug makers -- 5 million doses of the Medigen vaccine and another 5 million doses from United Biomedical Inc., (UBI) Asia.

UBI Asia announced late last month that it is also seeking an EUA in Taiwan for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, UB-612, after unveiling the interim results of its Phase 2 clinical trials.

The company said it will soon begin a Phase 2/3 efficacy trial in India involving 11,000 people.
UBI Asia also said its U.S. affiliate, Vaxxinity, has signed a contract with Paraguay to provide 1 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine once it receives EUA from the Taiwan.

Wanting to ""get back to normal"" isn't a good reason to stop doing something useful. Now is a great time to reevaluate what kind of habits we want to have moving forward. I'm not advocating for everyone wearing a mask all of the time, but there are certain circumstances that make a lot of sense. Are you feeling ill, but can't stay home; wear a mask. Interacting with a vulnerable population; wear a mask. Are you traveling through a busy airport and potentially spreading diseases from abroad; wear a mask.

Variants don't just pop-up spontaneously, they are the result of viral replication. Giving viruses more hosts to replicate in, even if those infections aren't life threatening, still increases the likelihood that new variants will arise. This isn't just a covid thing, it's true for all viruses. The next deadly iteration of influenza, or a type of novel corona virus, or many many other types of viruses could be avoided or at least delayed if we as a species do a better job of limiting the chances for infections. It isn't just masks, it's isolating when ill, washing hands regularly, encouraging vaccination and scientific literacy, and changing the way we deal with livestock.

My understanding is that severe Covid cases are more likely to lead to long term complications. This makes sense, and yes thankfully the vaccines protect really well against severe Covid. But I‚Äôve also heard lots of reports of very mild Covid cases leading to long/medium term loss of smell. This isn‚Äôt something I want to suffer. It would significantly hinder my mental health, and physical too potentially since I already deal somewhat chronic loss of appetite. I haven‚Äôt been able to find good data on long term anosmia but it is an incredibly common covid symptom. A study from last year found that 72% recovered their sense of smell after a month. 

So going by some *very* rough odds, if exposed to the Delta variant I could have 36% chance of contracting it, then a 60% chance of developing anosmia, and a 38% chance of it persisting more than a month. 

That‚Äôs about 8%. Probably less than that if you want to talk about multiple months (or longer) of anosmia. More research is necessary. 

So yeah, low probability, but I‚Äôd guess not ‚Äúvanishingly low,‚Äù at least for this specific (but also most common) long Covid symptom. 

IMO it comes down to your personal risk tolerance. For me, wearing mask in high risk situations isn‚Äôt a bother, and totally worth it.

Fwiw, I support the vaccine. I think as many people as possible should get it. But in *most* every country in the world, the vaccine is not available to all. Which is obviously the biggest issue. 

Also, you‚Äôre probably not gonna like hearing this, but when people feel they are attacked and misconstrued at the start (esp. from an obviously generic comment), they are less likely to meaningfully engage with you.

True.

This lines up with the latest data I've seen as well.

Anddddd...we just jumped off the deep end of the *How to Lie with Statistics* pool. C'mon man. I know based on your posting history that you understand efficacy is measured against the base rate of the population and not against assured illness. 

Furthermore, the ~80% number is efficacy against any symptomatic illness. Only very small percentage of people in this already tiny group experience the long term damage you're describing.

And it wasn't really give Canada some.   We are just being allowed to have shipments of Pfizer from the US now.   The united states was not allowing that before.  Until the first second week of May all Pfizer shipments for Canada came from their European factory.   All of the Moderna still comes from Europe and not from the US factories still (except for 1 million doses donated).     And you make it sound like the US did us a favour.  We had contracts with every major manufacturer to buy plenty of doses.   So this is our agreement with the companies that make it not the USA itself.  The USA just controlled what could be exported.   As for the border.   Well if you didn't have a shit show of a pandemic response before vaccinations maybe the border would be open now. 

So basically the US has really only given Canada 1 million doses.    1 million was received in June as part of the 80 million spread around to different countries.   This was Moderna.    And earlier this year they loaned (yep that is correct) 1.5 million doses of AZ after they decided to stop using it.    So essentially you didn't need it and wasn't going to use it so you loaned it to us.  That wasn't given but loaned to be replaced or paid for later.   So I don't see how the USA has given Canada many millions unless you are counting the vaccine we have purchased from Pfizer and is being shipped from the USA factory instead of the European one.    

Finally as part of our agreements the USA has said they are initially going to donate 500 million doses of the vaccine to countries worldwide.   That 1 million Canada got was part of that first 80 million.   Canada has said they will donate 100 million also which if you adjust for population means that Canada has said it will donate about 2 times more vaccine then the USA when based on population.

Also, that's not how odds work. It's not even close to even, let me try to explain to you. You would have to multiply the odds of an unvaccinated person catching covid on any given day by vaccine efficacy, then multiply by transmission rate, then by vaccinated transmission reduction rate. Once you're done with that you've got the odds of catching it and spreading it to someone else (obviously a very rough calculation, there are plenty of other variables)

Just to give an estimate that's about .001% or about 1/100,000.

I don‚Äôt think you know anything about Japan, they‚Äôre not a model minority. My best friend is Korean, currently living in Japan. There‚Äôs so much wrong with the society. They have high cases, no vaccinations. And their bureaucracy of old out of touch men is starting to catch up with them. On top of that they‚Äôve decided to go ahead with the olympics, of which thousands of volunteers have quit. They‚Äôre not the beacon that you think they are. And like many of their politeness, it‚Äôs incredibly performative at times. and on mask, unless you‚Äôre wearing something like an N-95, the mask isn‚Äôt that useful if the wider population isn‚Äôt wearing them. The science and the data is different. I‚Äôve always been looking at the data, for 18 months now. My industry in the uk (theatre and film is on the edge and has been for some time, 5 jobs and. 22k of work cancelled) A lot of people didn‚Äôt  have cushy home jobs throughout the pandemic.

I mostly agree with your points, but ""the vaccines have already almost taken vaccinated people out of the equation"" is unfortunately still debatable (I'm afraid it's not really the case) and that changes the conclusions considerably.

Of course ""\[unvaccinated\] are doing much more to put the vulnerable at risk than a vaccinated person ever will"" and I agree that we don't ""owe them mask-wearing"". But I don't consider a mask mandate to be *for them*, it's for all the innocent victims (those who can't get vaccinated, those who are insufficiently protected by the vaccine, etc.).

1. It‚Äôs in the middle of summer.

2. It will be the week most schools close for summer (6 weeks off).

&gt; As fully vaccinated citizens in our country and around the globe begin to dip their toes in the waters of a post-vaccination world, the following groups deserve greater consideration: immunosuppressed and immunocompromised people.


&gt; This is not a small number of people. **Estimates are that about 6.2 percent of adults ages 18-64 in the U.S. are living with weakened immune function, along with about 2.6 percent of children**, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. **The prevalence of immunosuppression appears to be on the rise, as many people are living longer with cancer, HIV, organ transplants, or with chronic therapy that make people more vulnerable to infections**.

&gt; These people live in communities all around the U.S. They are your neighbors, your sister‚Äôs friend, the person next to you in line at the grocery store.

&gt; **We have about 15 million people in the U.S. in this immunosuppressed group who are unlikely to mount strong immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines**. They need some extra help from all of us to stay safe.

‚Ä¶

&gt; Excluding immunosuppressed patients from the initial Phase III trials was the correct and necessary decision.

&gt; Unfortunately, however, we did not initiate concurrent parallel clinical trials in immunocompromised patients. That left this next round of trials for the vaccine makers or other philanthropic or government entities to ‚Äúpick up‚Äù and conduct.

&gt; This lack of foresight has impaired our knowledge of the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines among immunocompromised people. It brings us to the current state, in which the information we have on vaccination in organ transplant and cancer patients is an anecdotal collection of small studies showing that vaccines seem to be safe but, as predicted, elicit reduced levels of immune responses.
