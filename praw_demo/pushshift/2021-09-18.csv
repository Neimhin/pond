I'm not saying that bad side effects are likely or anything like that, but there is a risk to putting anything in your body so I can't demand a stranger take that risk for my benefit.

I may wish that everyone that should get vaccinated does, but I don't personally know everyone's reasoning and experience, and especially for those that are themselves low risk and are low risk for ending up in hospitals, I can't call them murderers, or shame them, or harbor animosity toward them as a group.

One more example. I have a friend whose dad had received a vaccine within the last year or so (I think it was a shingles vax but I'm not totally sure), and had a horrible allergic reaction to it. He ended up in the hospital and almost died. She was very nervous about getting the Covid vaccine. She didn't know if whatever reaction he had might be hereditary, and it wasn't clear what it was about that vaccine he reacted to. If she decided not to get the Covid vax because of that, even though her doctor says it would likely be fine, I would never hold it against her for not taking that risk for someone else's benefit. And I'm sure if she had decided not to get it, and she ended up in the hospital, she would have said she wished she got it (she did in fact get vaccinated without issue). Even if this wasn't a friend and was a stranger's story, I wouldn't think that they deserve to die or that I don't feel bad for them. I don't know everyone's story and since the majority of those I know that are not vaccinated have reasons like what I originally posted, I don't agree with the vitriol aimed at all those that choose not to get vaccinated.

[],False,,DillyOh,,,,,,"Depends on what you're looking for. Antibodies circulate in the Blood and Lymph (even tissue/mucosa) and have several ways of interacting with foreign stuff to make it harmless / neutralize it. So Antibodies prevent an Infection in the first place, but can be overwhelmed by sheer numbers of the inoculum (the pathogen load you receive upon first infection)

T- and B-cells are what produce Antibodies in the first place. B cells produce what is known as  soluable antibodies while T cells carry these antibodies around on their surface and can interact e.g with infected cells to kill them (they provide intracellular security while antibodies provide extracellular security).

So while Antibodies will prevent an infection (or, to some extent, prevent an infection from spreading), B- and T-cells will a) produce more Antibodies (from memory cells if you've been vaccinated or previously infected, else it takes 7-8 days for the B- and T-cell reaction to kick in) and b) seek out and destroy infected cells, leading to a clearing of the infection in most cases.

In an ideal scenario, Antibodies are ""more important"" (but keep in mind, no antibodies without B-cells) because they prevent infection. But since Delta and its dramatically increased viral load, some antibody counts are overwhelmed and thats where B- and T-cells come into play. (I believe the increased viral load of Delta is responsible for increased hospitalization rates, not some inherent change of virulence.

[],,,Synonyms26,,,,,,"HCM CITY ‚Äì The HCM City Department of Health has directed the People‚Äôs Committees of districts and Th·ªß ƒê·ª©c City to submit lists of the number of people aged 18 and over who have not received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.  
  
The lists will help the health department reserve and distribute the appropriate number of vaccine doses to specific areas. The department has asked local authorities to submit the information before Saturday (September 18).   
  
According to the HCM City Centre for Disease Control, as of September 15, the city had given 8,452,609 vaccine shots, including 6.6 million first shots and 1.7 million second shots. As many as 969,451 people aged 65 and over and people with underlying diseases have been vaccinated.  
  
The rate of first-shot coverage in the city has reached 92.5 per cent. Only districts 11 and 12 have given at least one vaccine dose to 100 per cent of its residents aged 18 and over.  
  
The city has been giving around 200,000 doses daily in the last few days.  
  
Health experts said that vaccine coverage is one of the most important conditions for the city to return to normal life and re-open economic and social activities in the future.  
  
Deputy Director of the city Health Department Nguy·ªÖn Ho√†i Nam said the city was seeking approval from the Health Ministry to reduce the time between two AstraZeneca COVID-19 shots from the usual eight to 12 weeks down to six weeks to speed up immunisation.  
  
According to Nam, the rate of infections found by testing has dropped, from 3.6 percent during the first testing round in high-risk areas to 2.7 percent in the second round and 1.1 percent in the third round.  
  
To discover all infections in the community, mass testing will continue at a faster rate.

Widespread testing  
  
HCM City‚Äôs steering board for COVID-19 prevention and control has asked the city‚Äôs health authority and districts to continue to take COVID-19 test samples from locals until the end of September, when the city will consider relaxing strict social distancing measures.  
  
City districts and Th·ªß ƒê·ª©c City have been asked to focus on widespread testing to quickly isolate and treat positive cases.  
  
In the city‚Äôs red (very high risk) and orange (high risk) zones, all family households will be pool-tested three times within seven days, either by antigen rapid testing or RT-PCR testing.  
  
The former method will require up to three members per household per test pool, while the latter will pool samples from all household members per test.  
  
For green and yellow zones (low risk and at-risk), representatives of households will be tested by RT-PCR, with 10 samples pooled for green zones and five for yellow zones.  
  
Households with five or more members must provide two members for testing. They will also have to offer different members for different testing rounds, and should prioritise members who have yet to be vaccinated or who have had frequent contact with many other people.  
  
Positive test pools will lead to all household members in the pools being tested individually once every five to seven days.  
  
Based on the test results, HCM City will reclassify its colour-coded zones to reflect new pandemic risk levels for future testing rounds.  
  
Locals are encouraged to take samples themselves with the help of local authorities. The city‚Äôs Department of Health will instruct relevant units to ensure there are sufficient testing kits and other necessary equipment.  
  
HCM City, Vi·ªát Nam‚Äôs COVID-19 epicentre, has recorded over 315,000 positive cases since late April.  
  
Since August 23, the city has gone through at least two rounds of widespread COVID-19 tests in the community. Some areas are carrying out their third or fourth testing round. The number of positive cases found from testing has been gradually decreasing, according to the city‚Äôs Department of Health. ‚Äì VNS",,,,,,,,,1632060899,,,{},hdgqugj,True,t3_pr8psz,False,True,t3_pr8psz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pr8psz/vietnam_hcm_city_tallies_up_locals_without_first/hdgqugj/,,1,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],text,t2_10wdsu,False,False,,[],1632167356.0

The data available for review is from the developers ‚Äì Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology JSC in HCM City with the support in administration and medical monitoring from the Military Medical University in H√† N·ªôi ‚Äì up until September 2 this year, as the final phase of clinical trials is ongoing for the recombinant DNA vaccine.  
  
Regarding the vaccine safety, Nano Covax is deemed to be safe in the short term based on reports of phase 3 trials (during the monitoring of the volunteers‚Äô health seven days after administration of the first dose for 11,430 volunteers, seven days after the administration of second doses for 5,785 volunteers).  
  
Regarding immunogenicity, Nano Covax is deemed to be able to elicit immune responses, based on ongoing phase 3 results ‚Äì anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test results on 924 samples 42 days after first jab; results of neutralising antibodies tests on 761 samples 42 days after first jab; plaque-reduction neutralisation test 42 days after the first jab on 107 samples with the original Wuhan strain of coronavirus, 41 samples with Delta variant, 39 samples with Alpha variant.  
  
The council‚Äôs statement stressed that to date they haven‚Äôt had the data to ‚Äúdirectly"" evaluate the protective efficacy, or the ability of a vaccine to prevent infection or symptomatic infections (based on of the number of people infected with COVID-19 after getting the shots), and said more study is needed for assessment of this ""most important criteria to determine the vaccine's quality.""  
  
The currently available estimation of Nano Covax‚Äôs protective efficacy extrapolated from its immunogenicity, or the level of antibodies in the vaccinated, however, has ‚Äúenough scientific grounds‚Äù for the council to send the vaccine documents to the Experts from the Advisory Council for the Registration of Circulation of Drugs and Medicinal Ingredients for reviews.  
  
Regarding the proposal to grant Nano Covax conditional approval for emergency use, the ethics committee said they reached ‚Äòconsensus‚Äô in the use of mid-term phase 3 trials for the drugs advisory body to deliberate.  
  
But it asked the vaccine candidate‚Äôs developers to supplement their reports as per the conclusions of the meeting and continue with the trials of the vaccine based on the approved outline to complete trials in March 2022, and give timely updates to the relevant committees and health authorities.  
  
Experts from the drugs registration advisory body, who will take up the case and make decisions on whether to give the emergency approval for the vaccine to be used in Vi·ªát Nam, were also present at the meeting, the press statement reads.  
  
Currently, 13,000 volunteers in phase 3 trials of Nano Covax ‚Äì which started on July and is set to wrap up by 2022 February ‚Äì have been given the second shots of the vaccine with dosage set at 25mcg.

The first cases of COVID-19, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2, were reported in December 2019. The vertiginous worldwide expansion of SARS-CoV-2 caused the collapse of health systems in several countries due to the high severity of the COVID-19. In addition to the vaccines, the search for active compounds capable of preventing and/or fighting the infection has been the main direction of research. Since the beginning of this pandemic, some evidence has highlighted the importance of a phenolic-rich diet as a strategy to reduce the progression of this disease, including the severity of the symptoms. Some of these compounds (e.g., curcumin, gallic acid or quercetin) already showed capacity to limit the infection of viruses by inhibiting entry into the cell through its binding to protein Spike, regulating the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, disrupting the replication in cells by inhibition of viral proteases, and/or suppressing and modulating the host‚Äôs immune response.

&gt;By Aug. 20, 51 students in the city‚Äôs small school district had tested positive for the coronavirus. Nearly 1,000 others had been flagged as close contacts and had to quarantine at home for seven to 10 days.

&gt;‚ÄùThat‚Äôs a lot of school, especially for children that are recovering from 18 months in a pandemic where they missed a lot of school or had to transition to virtual,‚Äù said Grant Rivera, the superintendent of Marietta City Schools.

&gt;Last week, the district changed tack. Students who are identified as close contacts can now continue attending school as long as they have no symptoms and test negative for the virus every day for seven days.

&gt;An increasing number of school districts are turning to testing to keep more children in the classroom and avoid disrupting the work lives of their parents. The resource-intensive approach ‚Äî sometimes known as ‚Äútest to stay‚Äù or modified quarantine ‚Äî allows students who have been exposed to the virus to stay in school as long as they take frequent Covid tests, which are typically provided by the school, and adhere to other precautions.

It's always a problem, right. The problem always exists. However this is a time where we are literally ALL affected to an intense degree that cannot be handwaved like we would with the flu. Humanity has always worked that way. In an ideal world, the flu vaccine would also be taken without question because people care about their fellow man and the consequences of their illness, but we don't live in that world. Ethically, I support the flu vaccine as well. You bet after this is over a subsection of people will be more privy to taking the flu vaccine.


The flu has not reached the scale of COVID's disaster. Not even close. Swine flu in recent years did not become this bad. [Here is an article. ](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20201218/covid-19-is-far-more-lethal-damaging-than-flu-data-shows)

The last pandemic that became this bad at this scale was 1918, which we also had antimaskers back then. They were just as stupid as they are now, but back then they at least had the excuse of it being genuinely new technology and even new *ideologically*. It was not overwhelmingly widespread and accepted as it is now with academia.


Edit: not getting vaccinated is equivalent to attempted murder when you directly cause others to get sick, yes. For example, being infectious and not telling others about it who may be vulnerable because of your own shitty pride. It's only the nonvaccinated you see doing this in large quantities. Science denial has become a badge of honor.

We are now at the point where vaccinated people are dying of treatable illnesses because of the sheer amount of science deniers taking the resources away from them willingly. You forget that our resources are strained and can only focus on some people at a time. So yes, it's equivalent to indirect murder at a certain point. Manslaughter. Ethically, you should take the flu vaccine as well. Ethically, it is the same. In practice, they are not equivalent because of the circumstances being widely different as well as the scale.

- The country has gradually been opening up throughout the summer. This lead to a moderate increase in July (when Delta hit), but since then numbers were stable despite more re-opening. The past month numbers have dropped significantly despite all restrictions now being dropped. While we may not have seen the final effect of the last restrictions getting removed (on September 10th), most restrictions were lifted earlier.

- Denmark has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world (~75% of the entire population fully vaccinated with Pfizer/Moderna). While the country initially didn't vaccinate as quick as countries like Israel, US and UK it was still the fastest vaccination pace in the EU.

- Denmark has one of the most thorough testing regimes in the world. Tests are free and available immediately (both PCR and quick-tests). Results from PCR are almost always available within 24 hours. Variant tracking is very thorough. Like most other countries the Delta variant has been dominant for the past couple of months.

- Compliance with government guidelines has been quite good compared to many other countries. We have certainly had our share of crazy antivaxxers, but they have remained fairly insular and it's not been tied to any broader political ideology.

- Full reopening includes nightlife and [big concerts](https://old.reddit.com/r/Denmark/comments/pmi12q/the_minds_of_99_har_lige_afholdt_koncert_for/) now. So far the numbers have kept going down.

Obviously the herd immunity claim is only the interpretation/opinion of a single scientist. While not clear from the quotes, I believe he isn't claiming complete 100% herd *immunity*, but a 'herd immunity'-effect keeping the spread of the virus in check.

**Edit:** I didn't mean for this to come of as self-congratulatory. We've made plenty of mistakes and there's a lot of our polices I think have been wrong and/or shortsighted. If this turns out to actually be a herd immunity effect I think it will have caught a lot of people here by surprise.",d0eb400e9c06546de82a7199a97fe62a320abe2e,True,False,,,,,0.0,1632078383,,0.0,{},hdhxi3p,True,t3_prdze6,False,False,t1_hdhvpm5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/prdze6/professor_about_the_low_positivepercentages_in/hdhxi3p/,1632152814.0,23,False,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,1,[],1632100751.0,[],text,t2_58sm5,False,False,,,

[],False,,Tamer_,,,,,,"&gt; I'm talking about production

You can't vaccinate 35M+ people for 3 months straight without having a 35M+ production rate.

&gt; my understanding was we would not even come close to ~16 billion doses for a while 

Please refer to what I already pointed out on that topic: ""Remove the children that aren't eligible for a vaccine dose and the anti-vaxxers"".

Even if we magically made 16 billion doses appear along with a billion workers to administer them, we wouldn't administer anywhere close to 16 billion doses. Nearly every country trickles in vaccination doses once they reach ~70% of total population, a very low production rate is able to sustain the rate after that.

So that's roughly 11 billion doses that we need ASAP for the entire world, there's roughly 5.85 billions already administered, so if we face no logistical issues and countries can financially procure the doses: we should be able to produce enough to vaccinate everyone willing and able within 5 months. 

But sure, there's an issue with booster shots. However, Western countries already have a pretty significant supply of doses. For example, [the US has over 60M doses on hand right now](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/?srnd=premium), [Canada has 9M](https://covid19tracker.ca/vaccinationtracker.html).

[],False,,Tamer_,,,,,,"Highly transmissible variants like delta can't remain endemic in a given population, they spread too fast to get a chance to ""circle around"". That's even more true when there's a large portion of the population that's vaccinated: herd immunity is reached even faster.

The potential problem is the constant flow of mutations that make previous immunity ineffective. But we haven't experienced that yet, since very few countries have reached any sort of herd immunity. I think Peru is the first, considering how much of its population died from it. [You can see how gradual the curve of new cases gets starting in spring](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/peru/): the delta variant didn't cause any kind of wave over there (unless their winter wave was related to delta? That's seems impossibly early)

However, with worldwide vaccinations picking up the pace, I think there's a very real chance that mutations get stymied. There would need to be super-variant that's resistant to vaccines AND easily infects people that already had the virus. Otherwise, this delta variant will prepare enough unvaccinated people that any similar variant will be fought off relatively easily.

edit: I've done a bit of math [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/pqfwdj/denmark_lifts_all_covid19_restrictions_due_to/hdei03f/) and with a R0=6 and 75% of the population vaccinated 3 times, then herd immunity is reached at ~44% of the population infected. That happens to be nearly as much as the UK *right now*.

If R0=7 with everything else remaining the same, then herd immunity is reached only when the infected population reaches 52.6%.

Increase the vaccination to 80% of the population though, and herd immunity is attainable again at 44% of the population infected.",a20511e42d5264795adea75d9cda208750ba94c7,True,False,,,,,0.0,1632004718,,0.0,{},hde123a,False,t3_pqfwdj,False,True,t1_hddw4cr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pqfwdj/denmark_lifts_all_covid19_restrictions_due_to/hde123a/,1632159282.0,1,False,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],1632020734.0,[],text,t2_421y4,False,False,,,

1. Antibody treatments need to be administered very early (before the symptom onset). This makes them almost impossible to use for ""normal"" people

2. ""Efficacy"" is not well established and it seems near certain that it's well below vaccines' efficacy

3. Time range of protection is definitely below vaccine's

4. Treatment is actually more invasive: until very recently it was only done with IV! Now it can be done with 4 injections in 4 different places of the body e.g https://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/covid19/assets/cov-antibody-treatment.pdf

The UK report contains total cases, &lt;50 and &gt;=50.   Let 's look at the age bands separately; I'm ignoring the half-vaccinated groups:

age &gt;= 50: 

8551 unvaccinated cases, 590 deaths: CFR 6.9%

71991 vaccinated cases, 1565 deaths: CFR 2.2%

age &lt; 50:

248803 unvaccinated cases, 132 deaths: CFR 0.05%

85407 vaccinated cases, 48 deaths: CFR 0.06%

[],False,,Tamer_,,,,,,"&gt; Most experts agree covid is here to stay we aren't getting rid of it anytime soon especially with Delta.

All experts failed miserably at making any good projections until [data scientists took the matter in their own hands](https://covid19-projections.com/historical-performance/). 

Actually, it's going to be easier with delta because so many people will get hit so quickly. It won't be lingering endlessly like the first strain. That quick spread is part of the reason why the UK is seeing a drop in cases now: not because of the *whooping* 5.4% of the population that got their 1st dose since July 1 (well, of course it helps, but I'm sure you get the point). 

Keep in mind that the infection also provides immunization once a person recovers, but also: the immune system response is even better when someone is infected + vaccinated. I already agree that with the current full vaccination rate of 65%, it would take a very long time for the UK to reach herd immunity. 

Assuming a 90% protection against infection from the vaccine, same from infection, and the current full vaccination rate of 65% of the population: the UK would need roughly 83% of the population infected to reach 90% total population immunity. Not realistic at all, I agree. 

However, 90% immunity in the population corresponds to a R0 of 10 and estimates for the delta variant range from 5 to 8. Even if we take a high value, say 7.5, and we do the math for a country with a reasonably high vaccination rate like Denmark (let's round it to 75%), the share of infections needed is quite a bit lower lower: 64% in fact. Here's basic arithmetic:

* 75% * 64% = population with near 100% immunity =&gt; 48%
* 75% * 36% = population with only vaccine immunity =&gt; 27% * 90% protection = 24.3%
* 25% * 64% = population with only infection immunity =&gt; 16% * 90% protection = 14.4%

There you have it, 86.6% effective protection in the population. But then you might point out that 64% of the population infected is huge, that it's very far away. Well, assuming that the tally of 135k deaths is reliable, that means there's been roughly 27M infections so far, give or take a couple millions. That represents 40% of the population already infected with SARS-Cov-2. So, yes, the UK would still be far away from herd immunity even if it increased vaccination to 75%.

But remember we picked a very high R0. If we drop it to just 6, still pretty high, then we're looking at 52.8% of the population infected to reach herd immunity.

And if we provide a booster shot which gives [up to 95% infection protection](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/coronavirus-in-israel-9891-new-cases-second-day-in-a-row-nearing-10k-677664), then we're talking about 43.9% of the population that requires infection to reach herd immunity.

&gt; Israel has vaccinated adults and teens but still have seen a rise.

And Israel is a reference why? Because they were the most vaccinated 6 months ago? Even the UK has higher vaccination rate right now...

&gt; Long term yes sure but for that we need the rest of the world vaccinated as well. Till the rest of the world is vaccinated we can forget herd immunity. 

There would be reintroduction of SARS-Cov-2 in a country that reached herd immunity, and small pockets of infections yes, but this new pocket would die out relatively quickly. 

&gt; I mean Africa is still like at below 20% vaccinated in some countries.

Most of them were at 0% in June, with a few of them with less than 5% and Morrocco the big exception at 15%. It's not much better right now at 3.8% fully vaccinated, but you know what's much better? Very little international movement with Africa.

But I agree they will need to get vaccinated and hopefully we deploy enough workers to assist them with it.

&gt; Its the whole reason we got Delta variant because low vaccinations around rest of the world. And low vaccinations across Africa etc=more possible variants.

Since the delta has started spreading, nearly 30% of the world got fully vaccinated. And there's likely going to be another 30% by the end of the year with India, Brazil, Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam and Pakistan currently leading the charge.

Along with how many people got infected already, the rate of mutations is going to slow down dramatically.",c4f707ca19a1181ac2951271f59e077f9dc3a966,True,False,,,,,0.0,1632012291,,0.0,{},hdei03f,False,t3_pqfwdj,False,True,t1_hddqi5y,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pqfwdj/denmark_lifts_all_covid19_restrictions_due_to/hdei03f/,1632158524.0,0,False,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],1632013199.0,[],text,t2_421y4,False,False,,,

For Pfizer and Moderna at least (didn't check others). They **were** tested for symptomatic infection alone. It looks like  e.g. Moderna was stated as 94.1% effective during phase 3 and CDC follow up study of HCW estimated around 90%.  Pfizer was similar based on a quick review. 


/End of edit

Not terribly concerning regarding efficacy. Of course preventing infection (sterilizing immunity) is the holy Grail, but they weren't all tested to that metric or touted as such but to severe disease and death, which they're all very effective at. It's an extra win that it does somewhat provide that for most people - I think if I recall something like a 60-70% reduction in risk of infection. But the 30-40% is still a lot of people by number when there's substantial community spread like now.  And groupings are inevitable since e.g. families might share genetic risk factors and of course possible shared environmental exposure if living together or interacting frequently.  

Someone correct my math: but assuming truly random distribution of infections and testing and half of people being vaccinated, with 100k infections per day,  at 60-70% you'd still expect I think~23K-28K vaccinated infections per day. 

And there's the bias on the internet and in life that everyone will tell you about them or someone they know being vaccinated and having a breakthrough case, but generally we don't go on about how we're vaccinated and didn't catch COVID this week. In which case, I'll say I've been vaccinated for ~5 months and haven't caught COVID in any of them.

Maybe I'm a bad person, but I'm kind of angry with them.  They are the adults in the room, and taking a firmer stance earlier might have helped shaped the pandemic in a dramatically different direction.  Two examples come to mind.

First, to hell with HIPAA.  Take pictures of the shit going on in the hospitals and post it everywhere.  If people could see they wouldn't behave the same way.  Same has been true in past health crises.  The pictures are what changes the public.  I understand the consequences might be high, but a few hundred thousand extra people not dying is where the Hippocratic oath is at.

Second, they really should have refused to treat unvaccinated patients months ago.  That would have frozen the anti-vax movement in their tracks.  The ""ethics"" the doctors are currently following are killing many, many people, just not by their own hand, and somehow that is morally superior?  Bullshit.  

My family has plenty of doctors in it, I'm not ignorant of their situation, I just think they played their hand very poorly, and I don't shy away from letting them know.  It's ridiculous how far we let the most extreme elements of society go in controlling the rest of us.

Earlier on in the pandemic, measuring exposure time, and thus what was considered to be close-contact, was done in a window of 24 hours.... as in, contact with someone for 10 minutes at one point during a day and then 5 minutes with someone else later during that day would count as 15 minutes total exposure time.  
I'm assuming that there isn't anything particularly concrete about having a 24 hour window specifically, but am imagining that the CDC used this as a guideline based upon it's study of the prison guard who contracted the virus, and was imagined to be a simple idea that could resonate to the general public. I'm wondering about the aspects of it that are specifically rooted in science, however. Is there something to the idea that an exposure to a non-infectious amount of virus at a certain time will be cleared by the immune system 24 hours later? Are there thoughts that it would actually generally be longer... or possibly shorter? Or is it just impossible to say with a serious degree of accuracy?

What Israel started seeing the last couple months is what Canada will see soon. Canada was slow to roll out. So was Spain. 

Way back in April, Israel had reached essentially the same vaccination rate it had before it started the boosters this month. Look where Spain and Canada were in April and look how long it took them to get to where they are now:

Do you see that? Canada's vaccination rate didn't even begin to level off until September. Canada has a few months to go before the majority of its vaxxed people see their antibodies and immunity wane. 

Last: The Provincetown cluster was 75% vaccinated people. You can pick around for details that made this cluster unique, but nothing is going to explain why 75% were vaccinated other than that the vaccines weren't extremely effective at preventing infection in the US northeast even back in July.

[],False,,Tamer_,,,,,,"&gt; It is clear that the vaccines do not offer a 100% effective sterilising immunity.

I'm aware, I assumed 90% protection from infection for 2 doses vaccination and 95% protection with 3 doses (called the booster shot). You can read the details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/pqfwdj/denmark_lifts_all_covid19_restrictions_due_to/hdei03f/).

&gt; When you also have a significant amount of the population who are not eligible or refusing vaccination, it is just not realistic.

80% is realistic in most countries, some have already reached it. But I agree it would take a lot of effort to even approach 75% in countries like the US or UK. At that level of vaccination, and with R0=7, we're looking at 60% of the population being infected. 

Surprisingly, that level of infection is realistic for the US since they have close to 44% of the population already infected with another 0.8-0.9% per week (which places the US at 60% total infected some time during next winter). [Up until May 2021 inclusively, the CDC estimated that 120M Americans had been infected.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html) Since then [there's been another 8.4M cases officially](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=), which means somewhere between 22M and 25M cases. Potentially more since infected people that got vaccinated are less likely to display symptoms and get tested.

&gt; There is not a single scientist who believes elimination is possible at this point

Really? [Here's what Gypsyamber D‚ÄôSouza and David Dowdy from JHU had to say about this last week""](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2021/what-is-herd-immunity-and-how-can-we-achieve-it-with-covid-19)

&gt; Is herd immunity still an achievable goal for COVID-19?

&gt; Yes‚Äîbut ‚Äúherd immunity to COVID-19‚Äù does not mean that we will soon achieve a level of immunity in the population, like what we see with measles, and coronavirus will be ‚Äúover.‚Äù 

[Here's what Amir Khan had to say in August](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2021/8/11/as-new-covid-variants-emerge-is-herd-immunity-impossible):

&gt; It can be achieved through the following:


&gt; Natural infection: when enough of a population has caught the infection and built up naturally acquired antibodies to the disease that protect against infection in the future
&gt; Vaccines: when enough people in a population have been vaccinated against a disease, allowing them to build up protective antibodies, without the need for infection, that are effective in protecting against serious infection in the future

[One more for the road, Jan-C√©dric Hansen explained in early September how herd immunity is achievable](https://www.france24.com/en/video/20210902-covid-19-pandemic-in-eu-dr-hansen-explains-why-herd-immunity-remains-elusive):

&gt; Now that the EU has reached the threshold of 70 percent, is herd immunity, and the pandemic's end, now in sight? [...] while we should be ""grateful"" for this crucial milestone, we must remember what we're still missing: there needs to be a uniform EU policy to battle the virus as well as a mass vaccination effort that will ""protect the population as a whole."" 

&gt; Dr. Hansen points out that ""we have tremendous amounts of youth who are not vaccinated so far."" This could effectively trigger, Dr. Hansen warns, ""a reservoir for the virus to spread, and it is most likely that the virus will adapt to the population that it can touch and contaminate."" 

&gt; But for Dr. Hansen, the biggest obstacle to achieving herd immunity is that ""this family (of virus) does not trigger naturally neutralizing antibodies, which means that this family of virus does not trigger herd immunity naturally."" So vaccination is key, concludes Dr. Hansen, ""It is not appropriate to believe that natural infection will provide a herd immunity. That's why we need a new generation of vaccines in order to elicit the herd immunity that we're looking for.""",04ee26dbbf4cfa43154be61e66a46a8d2766bfa1,True,False,,,,,0.0,1632023898,,0.0,{},hdf7s18,False,t3_pqfwdj,False,True,t1_hdemyph,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pqfwdj/denmark_lifts_all_covid19_restrictions_due_to/hdf7s18/,1632157361.0,0,False,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,[],text,t2_421y4,False,False,,,

[],False,,jacobolus,,,,,,"This is a misunderstanding. Usually a larger-than-average demographic cohort leads to another larger-than-average cohort about 1 generation later (the timing of which is based on the average age of mothers giving birth, which is now about 30).

The baby boom was a special circumstance because a large number people delayed having children or could not afford to have children during the great depression and then WWII, and then afterward there was an economic boom in which many families had the means to have many children, leading to a notable increase in birth rates circa 1940‚Äì1965 compared to the 2 decades before or any time since. Chart: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/US_Birth_Rates.svg

Since then though, birth rates have steadily fallen. There were no other similar ‚Äúbooms‚Äù in the sense of very high birth rates.

Instead, US demographics for the past 80 years have been driven by a 1-generation-long cycle where the cohorts about an integer number of generations after the baby boom were larger than average, while the half-integer-generation cohorts were smaller than average. (There are of course new immigrants, some people who have children especially young or old, etc., so each subsequent ripple is less pronounced than the original bubble.)

We should currently still be in a larger-than-average cohort (the tail end of 2 generations post baby boom ‚Äì the current relatively larger cohort of parents is in the 25‚Äì29 age range, which is about the median age for having kids), but birth rates have been falling faster than would be expected due to demographics alone; compared to a few years ago, fewer people of the same age are deciding to have children.",b0a7d29fcdeda8859f2fb788fa78b3670aabf27d,True,False,,,,,0.0,1632030747,,0.0,{},hdfj7w7,False,t3_pqw6ex,False,False,t1_hdf404i,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pqw6ex/covidstricken_alabama_had_more_deaths_than_births/hdfj7w7/,1632156841.0,45,False,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],1632031498.0,[],text,t2_2ztg,False,False,,,

&gt;Their argument is basically this: I haven't contracted COVID yet so far and if I do, chances are very small that I would be hospitalized (there is about a 2% chance of hospitalization after contracting Covid, and since that's not adjusted for age/co-morbidities, it would be even lower for those young and healthy). Since I could still spread it even if I would be vaccinated, I just don't see the point of getting a vaccine we don't know the long term effects of, when my chances of getting Covid severe enough to even be hospitalized are so low.

I'm disabled, my only community has been online gaming. Many of my friends are across the globe.

Almost half of them are gone, I have confirmed at least 5 dead, 1 because his school is in Texas and they refused to implement or enforce a mask policy there. One was a heart attack, he suffered a congenital disease, the only friend my age (in his 40s), only because they didn't have room in the hospital.

The other two were in cancer treatment and had complications. One died in transport because the nearest hospital was full, the other died again because of lacking room, both in their 20s.

This was over the last year, these were humans who had no choice, nothing they did could have improved their chances. It was all caused by antivaxxers and maskless freaks. The rest of my silent friends I have no idea, they could be dead or mourning their own losses, but a few are young and live with antivaxxer parents.

I am the foulmouthed auntie of the crew, many of these were eSports hopefuls, others trying to be entertainers, I was the one who gave them servers to play on and connected them with my own fans. Their lives are over, they're gone, cut short, ruined.

After you are vaccinated your immune system is actively trying to find and kill covid-19 viruses. After a while that converts to long term immunity. The difference between the two is how much of a head start a new covid-19 infection can get going before the immune system nukes it.

Delta because it's more infectious gets more of a head start than early strains.

The other things to keep in mind is PCR tests are exquisitely sensitive. They can pick up the slightest infections. Ones that may not be meaningful from a clinical or public health perspective. Meaning the infection is asymptomatic and non-infectious.

My take being vaccinated is not to over worry. But also avoid unvaccinated people.

&gt;Today, many Americans are once again willing, even eager, to suffer a little for the reward of immunity from a virus that has turned the world upside down.   
**Roughly half** of those vaccinated with the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, and in particular women, experience unpleasantness ‚Äî from hot, sore arms to chills, headache, fever and exhaustion. Some boast about the symptoms. They often welcome them.   
Suspicion about what was in the shots grew in the mind of Patricia Mandatori, an Argentine immigrant in Los Angeles, when she hardly felt the needle going in after her first dose of the Moderna vaccine at a March appointment.   
A day later, though, with satisfaction she says it ""felt like a truck hit me. When I started to feel rotten I says, 'Yay, I got the vaccination.' I was happy. I felt relieved.""

This whole thing is so far beyond disappointed/anger and in disbelief that so many would imagine something nefarious about this vaccine and the virus isn't real. When did we stop believing science? 

I work on an ICU, and it's scary to me that I have so many friends who are quitting, or are wanting to because we just don't have any compassion for a person that could have avoided getting intubated.  I have 17 people currently on my ICU, which is normally a 12 bed room. We had to double our rooms because we have so many paralyzed/sedated and on a vent. It's freaking insane you guys. NOT ONE VENTED PERSON WAS VACCINATED.This was where we were 16 months ago.  We were doing pretty dang good, 40ish people ill from covid by maybe March or so(dates are pretty hard can't remember exact time but the numbers are pretty accurate).. now we have about 340.  The peak during the last big rush of ill people we topped out at I believe 450+.  Can't even help people the way they need it because we're so inundated.  I guess.. I'll make my paycheck at this point cleaning up the idiots that refused the medicine behind the vaccine and are now getting every freaking drug you can imagine. Paralytic, sedated, tube feed, rectal tube to keep their back side from backing up and potentially causing blockage. Arterial line to keep a close eye on their heart, after a while meds to keep your blood pressure up as well as your heart rate because those two usually give out second, first being the lungs. Can't absorb oxygen to the point basically a super charger gets set up to their lungs (that process is scarily violent, but you have to be quick getting that tube in). Vent pushing multiple times the regular pressure of our atmosphere into your lungs, occasionally a lung bursting because the lung gets so stiff from scarring up, as the disease does to you. I could go on for some time but I'll shut up and leave it at this 

.. I'm upset. My whole crew is. This really sucks, that the tinfoil hat crew has to ruin the health of this country. I'll keep you alive, but you're fault fruit everything happening. A shot would have made this not happen.  I got covid just about a month ago and I was extremely sick. I'm vaccinated.  But you know what?

3- very large child population and unemployment, more than 40% of our population is under 18, the age group that is hardest to vaccinate.

[],False,,adeveloper2,,,,,,"I would suggest flagging this article as clickbait or vaccine misinformation for the following reasons:

1. This article pushes the narrative that Sinovac ""does not work"" and that there is no antibodies generated in Regina Ip's system. However, it actually did produce antibodies shortly after administration and hence this is an issue with antibody decay rather than the vaccine not facilitating antibody production. This article from HK01 (local news) has mentioned a crucial detail that is conveniently omitted in this HKFP article:

&gt;  
&gt;Translation: Regina Ip mentioned on Facebook that she took the first Sinovac shot on Feb 22, second shot on May 28. At that time, the antibody level was 182.6, which was within acceptable limit. However, the blood test on this week showed negative on antibody, which indicates there is no more antibody.

Many animals that are susceptible to COVID are endangered or worse and are part of global repopulation programs. Letting them potentially die or be crippled by a COVID infection is counter to that.

Considering the sheer amount of anti-maskers I saw at the zoo who refused to wear a mask around the monkeys and big cats, the animals really need to be vaccinated. For example, I went to a zoo where masks were required ""unless you had a medical exemption"" AKA ""If you're not wearing a mask we won't press it because surely you have a medical issue"". BUT, this zoo did have signs up saying that masks were absolutely required no matter what around the outdoor monkey and big cat exhibits. Well, nobody respected that obviously.

At the time I had only heard a few things about it and had no idea what it was, if I had realized it was already going through the area I would have been terrified, so I'm glad I didn't. I got tested for COVID antibodies later on and with how I described it, they told me that I had it.

It was a terrible 2 weeks, the worst illness I've ever had, and my sense of smell took almost another 2 weeks to come back. I had coughing fits for about a month after.

I got my second Pfizer shot in May and tested positive for COVID again when my friends (they're vaccinated too by the way) and I all started feeling sick in mid-August. I assume with Delta.

My one friend's co-worker had apparently been complaining about ""having a cold,"" but still came into work and gave it to everyone. My friend had a mask on but most people there were vaccinated and didn't care to wear one.

I self-quarantined for 2 weeks to be safe, but I was really only seriously sick for about 3-4 days. I did still have a bit of coughing for about a week after.

&gt;The variant caused caseloads to surge in Britain and India this spring and summer, and in both countries outbreaks resurfaced after cases had seemed to be on the decline. The Delta variant has been fueling outbreaks in the United States throughout the summer, its contagiousness taking advantage of the number of people who have resisted Covid-19 vaccinations.

&gt;The data on Delta‚Äôs prevalence, contained in the C.D.C.‚Äôs latest biweekly report of virus sequencing, shows it climbing from just over a quarter of cases in mid-June to near total dominance in September.

&gt;‚ÄùIt‚Äôs not unexpected, because it‚Äôs more transmissible, but it is also a strong reminder that we need to have continuous vigilance,‚Äù said Dr. Saskia Popescu, an epidemiologist and assistant professor at George Mason University.

&gt;The C.D.C.‚Äôs COVID Data Tracker, reporting results for the two-week period ending on Sept. 11, put the B.1.617.2 lineage of Delta at 99.4 percent among variants of concern, with two other Delta lineages tracked at 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent, the Mu variant ‚Äî first detected in January in Colombia ‚Äî at 0.1 percent and several other, unidentified variants at 0.2 percent. That data is based on thousands of sequences provided every week through the C.D.C.‚Äôs national genomic surveillance efforts, according to the agency‚Äôs website.

&gt;The country recently experienced a rise in hospitalizations, despite the availability of highly protective vaccines, and the Delta variant has been cited as the cause.

&gt;‚ÄùWe‚Äôre seeing more children in the hospital now because the Delta variant is more readily transmissible among everybody, adults and children,‚Äù Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation‚Äôs top infectious disease doctor, told The New York Times on Sept. 9.

&gt;Dr. Popescu said the rise of Delta should help Americans and health officials realize the coronavirus remains a serious public health threat.

&gt;‚ÄùThe biggest piece is, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt let your guard down.‚Äô We need continuous surveillance, genomic sequencing, access to testing and public health interventions,‚Äù Dr. Popescu said.

&gt;Vaccination and wearing masks can help, she said.

&gt;‚ÄùWe have transmission occurring with very limited exposure, and that means that, for example, times without a mask, when you are out and around others, become much more of a risk,‚Äù Dr. Popescu said.

[],,,T0c2qDsd,,,,,,"I understand that ethical principles there, but the reality is that if you‚Äôre in the states, supply is high enough that getting a booster in some form isn‚Äôt meaning someone else is going unvaccinated.  It just means existing supply is getting used (which is not going abroad).

(Practically, I think the US absolutely should have not enforced its trademarks on the mRNA vaccines and instead helped other nations build manufacturing capacity as aggressively as possible.  Or aggressively shipped vaccines overseas as vaccination rates waned here.  But that‚Äôs neither here nor there, and not in my control.)

Anecdotally‚ÄîI got the J&amp;J shot, and I made the decision (after talking it through w/my spouse &amp; several doctors, who made it clear they weren‚Äôt giving me medical advice but said it‚Äôs what they‚Äôd probably do in my position) to get a booster of Moderna w/o FDA approval for it, because I didn‚Äôt like the foot-dragging being done around that or the lack of tracing of breakthrough cases or booster research.  My reasoning was‚ÄîI‚Äôd probably survive COVID-19 with J&amp;J alone on board, but if getting an extra shot reduces the chance of me being a /vector/ to others and/or developing a serious breakthrough case, that‚Äôs a net good for both my community (and me).  In short‚ÄîI decided the ethical imperative for ‚Äúmore vaccinated people‚Äù (which I can‚Äôt affect by not getting a booster, with doses going unused in my area) was outweighed by any theoretical reducing in my likelihood to spread COVID-19 (and where the primary harm from that choice would likely fall primarily on me instead of others).

I do not understand your logic/ethics. Is the death of those from deadly viruses only a problem when it is at the death rate of COVID-19? 

Hundreds of thousands are hospitalized and tens of thousands die every year from influenza ([CDC Source](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/past-seasons.html)). 

&gt;because our hospitals are not overflowing

Just 3 years ago, hospitals were overflowed with influenza cases ([Source](https://time.com/5107984/hospitals-handling-burden-flu-patients/)).

&gt;I would also support a flu mandate.

Why has the CDC not mandated it then? Year after year, and no mandate.

&gt;You can somehow find a way to justify running into pedestrians with your car and claim it is your freedom to do so but you're still a horrible murderer if you do.

Then let's make your logic clear: Are you saying not getting vaccinated is murder?

It differs only in degree and all points in the same direction.  

Somewhere between 5-7 months post vaccination, effectiveness drops by a fairly significant amount.  Yes, the vaccines are still very effective at preventing infection and extremely effective at preventing hospitalization and death.  But there is a real drop in both categories.

If they want to argue that hospitalization and death prevention is the primary goal, then they should be explicit about that.  They also should be explicit that this is a change in direction from earlier in the year when the goal was very much the prevention of infection.  Decreased effectiveness in preventing infection means reduced effectiveness in preventing SPREAD as well.

*""The only explanation I can see is that we have achieved herd immunity.""*

Eskild Petersen, professor emeritus at the clinical department at Aarhus University, told Ritzau about Friday's low infection rate.

*""I can't see any other reason when we have completely opened up society and at the same time experience such low infection rates""*, he says.

In the past 24 hours, 324 new coronary cases were registered on the basis of 46,389 PCR samples.

This means that the rate of infected is 0.70 percent. This is the lowest level since 11 July this year, when the so-called positive rate was 0.62.

**Translation (DeepL):**

A professor points out that herd immunity may be the reason for the relatively low and stable infection rates.

*""The only explanation I can see is that we have achieved herd immunity.""*

*""I can't see any other reason when we have completely opened up society and at the same time experience such low infection rates""*, says Eskild Petersen, Professor Emeritus at the Clinical Institute at Aarhus University.

The last COVID restrictions were removed on 10 September.

*""About 75 percent are now vaccinated. We always thought that we would have to get above 85 percent before we would see that there is so much immunity in the population that the virus has difficulty coping""*, says Eskild Petersen.

The professor points out that this may be because the numbers we have had for how infectious the virus variants have been have been too high.

A professor points out that herd immunity may be the reason for the relatively low and stable infection rates.

*""The only explanation I can see is that we have achieved herd immunity.""*

*""I can't see any other reason when we have completely opened up society and at the same time experience such low infection rates""*, says Eskild Petersen, Professor Emeritus at the Clinical Institute at Aarhus University.

The last COVID restrictions were removed on 10 September.

*""About 75 percent are now vaccinated. We always thought that we would have to get above 85 percent before we would see that there is so much immunity in the population that the virus has difficulty coping""*, says Eskild Petersen.

The professor points out that this may be because the figures we have had for how infectious the virus variants have been have been too high.

They are young and healthy and not in a high risk demographic. I just don't understand the argument that getting vaccinated is about caring about other people, when you can still spread it if you are vaccinated.

Their argument is basically this: I haven't contracted COVID yet so far and if I do, chances are very small that I would be hospitalized (there is about a 2% chance of hospitalization after contracting Covid, and since that's not adjusted for age/co-morbidities, it would be even lower for those young and healthy). Since I could still spread it even if I would be vaccinated, I just don't see the point of getting a vaccine we don't know the long term effects of, when my chances of getting Covid severe enough to even be hospitalized are so low.

I don't have a great argument against that. And because of that, I couldn't call them traitors or murderers.

I know people whose reason for not being vaccinated is because the government put something in the vaccine that will kill everyone that gets it in two years. Or other conspiracy crap. That stuff pisses me off and to me is totally different than others who have the reasoning I listed above.

[],False,,vcwalden,,,,,,"Well I don't know about that. That's rather confusing to say the least.... Two people I know didn't take the vaccine (they both said they were very healthy men and they would beat the covid-19 flu if they even got it)! They both got Covid-19 and survived! Again, they decided they wouldn't get the vaccine because they just knew they were now better protected from ever getting Covid-19 again, in fact, they were better protected than if they took the vaccine! 10 days ago both came down with Covid-19, again! One died 3 days after getting it again! The second just passed away yesterday! How does this make sense on their part? The only thing I am 100% sure of is they will never get it again and they have left huge hospital and funeral bills for their families to pay! How sweet of them to do this for their loved ones...

So why should the insurance companies take on debt because of this kind of rational? Or why should our hospitals and doctors incure debt from those who have to receive medical care for their illnesses? And what about our funeral homes who have to take care of them after they pass? If any one of these businesses belonged to you I'm sure you would have a different view. Businesses are in the business of making money! It doesn't matter if they are the mom and pop variety or big business. 

So there have been 3 people who have passed away from the vaccine(s). To their loved ones I'm sorry for your loss! Yup, there have been the cases of people getting sick from the vaccine that have ranged from a sore arm to a fever and other symptoms. Lots of individuals had no symptoms at all. Congratulations you survived! I, personally, would rather endure the mild symptoms I experienced (sore arm to the touch and being tired for about a day and a half) even if my health care provider told me I will have to take a booster every month just to stay as healthy as I can from NOT getting Covid-19 and dieing!

The FDA Advisory Board believes there's no evidence that boosters are for anyone other than the immunocompromised, those 65 or older, or those who are of high risk.

In Israel, they started their vaccinations early, like we did, and didn't space out the doses that much, like we did. Now they're struggling with Delta. And they have about 60% vaccinated, apparently? While we have about 50% fully vaccinated, and roughly 70% with just one dose. So, their situation is pretty similar to ours. They even can't vaccinate those under 12 yet, just like us.

So....how is that not evidence that boosters are gonna be needed for everyone? Why are the experts so divided about this? For some reason, it seems like a bunch of these scientists who up until now knew their shit are inexplicably extremely against boosters.

On average a person admitted to a nursing home has 3 serious health conditions (heart disease, cancer, diabetes, dementia, etc) and lives less than a year. Another way to say this is that about 1-2% of nursing home residents die every day. If they die after getting the vaccine that can just be a coincidence i.e. correlation is not causation.

He said the rate of fatality after vaccination was 411 in 100,000 and yet 40% of covid fatalities are in nursing homes, I don't see how you can conclude that the vaccine does not protect people.

He also said that myocarditis can happen 1 in 1000 cases. Studies have shown that it's in the 100-150 per million range. And myocarditis is not always fatal, it's a condition that can be treated etc.

If he is bringing this up in the spirit of things that the FDA should look into before committing to a booster program for everyone than this makes sense -- he is not drawing conclusions but raising concerns.

Do people in new england not mask where possible?  I guess I think people should mask (properly, over nose, mouth, and chin) where possible, but that vaccinated people should be able to dine-in, etc. (where masking is not possible) if they want to.

&gt; until this is over.

I also question what this means, as the nature of exponential growth means that cases will explode and we will be back to where we are today if masking/distancing stops without adequate population level immunity.  We get that immunity from vaccinations and from infections.  With the ""Russian flu"" (also a coronavirus) which spread unchecked in the late 1890s, this took ~3 years and resulted in a large amount of death.  Today, we have the vaccines as an option, but if people refuse them, I am willing to accept them getting immunity through infection as a means to get more immunity.

A big part of the nursing shortage is because traveling nurses are paid so much more than nurses that are on staff at hospitals. And a shortage means the nurses who stay are stretched even more thin and burn out faster. I have not seen anything that says the primary or even major reason for the nursing shortage is because of emotional fatigue due to the unvaccinated.

When I mentioned diabetes, I specifically referred to someone who was hospitalized because they knowingly made choices that resulted in hospitalization (ex. Didn't bother taking their medication as they were supposed to). I certainly do not mean every diabetic person. All I was trying to do was point out that there are many reasons a person could be hospitalized that were preventable. So not carrying about or holding contempt for the hospitalized unvaccinated should logically carry over to every person currently hospitalized that is there because they knowingly took a risk (ex. They were doing drugs, not wearing a seatbelt, not taking their meds, etc), and I am not willing to hate everyone that is sick for a preventable reason.

The [science](https://investors.modernatx.com/static-files/c43de312-8273-4394-9a58-a7fc7d5ed098) shows that a 6-month booster increases immunity dramatically over what the second shot (prior to any waning) gave.  It brings neutralization against Delta up higher than it was against wildtype after the second dose (when we know efficacy against infection was at 95% and breakthroughs were a non-issue).

The only arguments against boosters are based on supply and timing.  We're 50-100 days from a worldwide excess of vaccine doses.  We're several months away from most Americans being at their 6-month mark since second dose.  And we'd really like to use that time to get more data, since the research on this so far is very limited (but overwhelmingly positive).

[],,,lydiav59-2,,,,,,"After I hit save I realized that wasn't the best choice of words, but honestly couldn't think of anything else that conveyed my feelings quite as well.

I was talking to a woman at the tail end of last year before vaccines were available. Her husband was being treated for cancer at the time. She was telling me how high her stress level was with the addition of covid to worry about. She was telling me how she often she was starting to run into unmasked people in the few stores she had to go to.

It got to the point that she started ordering her groceries, and whatever else she could, for delivery. I told her about my pharmacy that offers free delivery. If there's an emergency of some type, their pharmacists will go in and fill a prescription in the middle of the night and deliver it. She told me she was going to immediately change all of their prescriptions over to them.

As someone who's husband had terminal cancer in 2018, I can't imagine the anxiety levels that woman, and others in the same situation, were and are going through. I know how high my anxiety was trying to keep my husband safe from communicable ""things"" when he was sick.

About 3 months before my husband died, we had a big outbreak of chicken pox in our area. It started at a local private, religious school who allowed parents to opt out of vaccinations for their kids on religious exemptions. I started wearing disposable gloves on the rare occasions I had to go to the store during that time. People looked at me like I was bat shit crazy. I did not care one bit. I'd be like a crazy woman washing my hands every 5 minutes when I got home. I'd take a shower, change my clothes ... pretty unhinged.

I don't think a day goes by now that I don't think of, and worry about all of the people who even though vaccinated, are weakened enough that they probably wouldn't survive a breakthrough infection. I truly have come to the point that I despise anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers. I'm in the U.S. south and pretty much surrounded by them in my area. There is only 1 couple I know that are vaxxed and take everything seriously, but how often can I bend their ears with my outrage before they don't want to talk to me anymore?

Ooof ... I'm sorry for the long rant. Since my husband died, I'm pretty much on my own. No kids, what family members that are left are over 1000 miles away. Although they are masked and vaxxed, they don't watch the news and prefer to live in a state of ""ignorance is bliss"". So I don't really have anyone to talk to , and I really needed to get that off of my chest. If you read this, thank you so much for listening. :) I actually feel better getting that off my chest.",,,,,,,,,1632080153,,,{},hdi2298,False,t3_pr6ipc,False,True,t1_hdhh8lg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pr6ipc/antivaxxers_remove_covid_patient_from_hospital/hdi2298/,,1,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],text,t2_2jfhmy7p,False,False,,[],1632193206.0

Here, an older fellow was convinced that he should leave, against medical advice, by someone who knew, or should have known, the risks. The older man, even if sound of mind (which I lean towards since the staff showed him to make the decision) did not choose to leave on his own, he had to be convinced and assisted. Thus there was an active role the anti-vax idiot played. He should be held accountable as his advice was not medically accurate, medicsl advice not by a medical professional, harmful, and against current best practices.

[],,,chrisfarleyraejepsen,,,,,,"This comment is a perfect example of how bad commenting works to misinform the reader. Before I continue, I encourage everyone to read the article linked, as I do not recommend getting one's news from the comment section alone. 

Having said that, the comment above is highly misleading. There are plenty of examples of horse owners in the article who have been faced with the price tripling, or unable to find ivermectin at all. Yes, supply and demand is a thing, no one is debating the world's most basic economic system. However, the comment above fails to consider that the *reason* supply is down and demand is up is because of people who consider ivermectin to be a legitimate way to treat or prevent COVID-19, and the lack of supply and increased prices affect those with a legitimate need (horse owners). 

I'm going to ask anyone reading this comment to take a look at the link placed above and take special care to see the phrase *""Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings""*, which the commenter above me ignored in order to push his narrative that ""huh, all of a sudden we went from 'this needs to be studied more' to 'unproven horse dewormer is crazy talk'"" for literally no reason. This makes no sense for a couple reasons. First, as far as I know, there still hasn't been any scientific conclusion to this study. The biggest issue, however, is that there's a world of difference between a carefully controlled study happening in March 2020 and crazies screaming ""IVERMECTIN IS THE CURE!"" from the rooftops without even bothering to consider dosage, use cases, or any other piece that's normally considered when you're prescribed a drug from a legitimate source. If we were talking about cancer rather than COVID, this would quite literally be the difference between going under a prescribed regimen of chemotherapy carefully controlled by your doctor and oncologist, and taking a flight to Ukraine to skirt around the edges of Chernobyl in hopes the radiation will knock out those tumors. 

I haven't even mentioned the fact that most of these people are looking for Ivermectin because they don't trust what's in the vaccine in the first place, as if somehow the dosing advice they found on an internet forum should be any more trustworthy, but whatever.",,,,,,,,,1632057950,,,{},hdgktpo,False,t3_pr3j7k,False,False,t1_hdgfpmk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pr3j7k/horse_owners_cant_find_ivermectin_as_americans/hdgktpo/,,7,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],text,t2_4r9l605u,False,False,,[],1632163961.0

We have a high deductible plan. the surgeon originally said it should come out at the end of 2018 but since she was able to easily manage the occasional flare-ups, we delayed to the start of 2019 since no matter when we'd do it, we'd be paying thousands due to the deductible.

It was an outpatient procedure (check in, surgery, some recovery, go home same day for those unfamiliar). Total time in hospital was maybe 8 hours from walking in the door for check in to getting loaded into the car to go home. The ""negotiated"" bills for all services (anesthesiologist, surgeon, and hospital) was nearly $25k.

Our out-of-pocket max was just shy of $7k. Since we had postponed from the end of 2018, we had taken the time to get the money ready since we know roughly what we would owe. Sold some underperforming employee stock purchase from a decade prior and pulled some from savings so that when the bills came in, we were ready to pay. First bill to arrive was the hospital and that was over $10k. Insurance paid everything over our max so we owed just a little over $6k (we'd already had a couple medical claims before the surgery so had already paid some on our deductible).

Since we had the money ready, we called the hospital to see how we could pay the bill. That's when we found out about the ""pay in full discount"". They took 25% off for us being willing to pay the entire balance immediately - a $1500 savings. Since the discount was from the hospital and not part of the negotiated insurance rate, we still got full credit towards our deductible.

The bonus was that for the rest of the year, ALL our medical expenses were 100% covered. Kind of liberating to be able to tell a medical provider ""Whatever test you want to do, go ahead, it's free to me...""  :-)",,,,,,,,,1632057005,,,{},hdgj2a6,False,t3_pqxx4d,False,False,t1_hdg2i08,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pqxx4d/the_days_of_full_covid_coverage_are_over_insurers/hdgj2a6/,,8,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],text,t2_4jdqv,False,False,,[],1632162961.0

This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions. However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

Then they compare heart attacks after vaccination to unvaccinated people, but of course vaccinated people are decades older on average so heart attacks (and mortality in general) is dozens or hundreds of times more likely in this group.

They don't reference the exact studies, which makes it hard to refute anything directly, but also makes it quite likely that the studies simply do not exist.  Using VAERS data to argue against vaccination is active misinformation.

Excess mortality is available for the full US [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm).  It corresponds very closely to COVID waves, with essentially negative values in between waves.

Shots fired.

I was downvoted into oblivion yesterday for criticizing the recommendation as being based on factors like vaccine equity rather than science.  What's interesting is that one of the two dissenting votes came from Dr Peter Marks who is the head of CBER at the FDA, the group that actually decides on the booster.  They can choose to completely ignore Friday's recommendation and approve the booster for all.  Actually wouldn't surprise me if they did just that, would be the second time the FDA has done that so far this year (first being that Alzheimer drug).",,,,,,,,,1632079709,,,{},hdi0wuo,False,t3_pr34g7,False,False,t3_pr34g7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pr34g7/daily_discussion_thread_september_19_2021/hdi0wuo/,,12,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],text,t2_r3xju,False,False,,[],1632192610.0

Yes, everyone paying attention knew that it was possible! Officials never said otherwise either.  (and, no-plans-for-boosters Is accurate enough)

However, ""possible"" is not the same as ""certain"". Timeline is also critical: a booster every 6 months is very much different from you-just-need-a-3rd-vaccination. Should officials stress all things which could happen?  Some ""possible"" things: virus quickly  mutating to avoid vaccines or, far worse, mutating so that vaccines trigger ADE?

After months of pleading with my decades long anti vaxx at risk parents to get the vaccine, they DID get the infusion. It took almost a full week of delta covid symptoms for them to do it, but it helped them a lot.

What terrifies me is they would never even have known about it if I hadn‚Äôt been following coronavirus developments on their behalf, and told them. Then hounded them from the moment of positive testing to get the process started to get the antibodies. It took myself and several other siblings, as well as what amounts to a miracle of scheduling, for them to get the antibody treatment. 

Our relationship will never be the same. But they are alive and seem to be recovering well. My uncle who refused the antibody treatment is currently hospitalized with covid pneumonia. 

Best of luck with your parents, I hope they recover. It is such a painful path we have to walk, just know you are not alone. ‚ù§Ô∏è",90b2c1dfa76e1cd480ead4e0d41bc1c6a744d5fa,True,False,,,,,0.0,1632079179,,0.0,{},hdhzj5c,False,t3_pr6ipc,False,True,t1_hdgufcq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pr6ipc/antivaxxers_remove_covid_patient_from_hospital/hdhzj5c/,1632152728.0,1,False,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],1632079534.0,[],text,t2_wrdnl,False,False,,,

Immunity to infection wanes. It does not disappear, but it indisputably wanes. Wanes is the perfectly accurate word for it. 

People who require not to get infected need to know this so that they can take appropriate measures: whether that means to monitor their antibodies and boost, or to avoid high-risk contacts if they do not want to take the chances implicit in that course of action, which has no controlled studies behind it, and of course never will. That is the established standard of care for veterinarians at high risk for rabies.

Someday it might be established that regular covid boosters at certain intervals can be administered safely, at which point titers will not be necessary, as the booster will be cheaper than the blood test, and proven safe no matter how often it is given, with certain intervals. That is the established standard of care for the elderly and tetanus.

There simply isn't enough safety information available for some national regulatory bodies to make the decision in favor of population-level boosters yet.

[],False,,redgreenyellowblu,,,,,,"I agree. This isn't a TV show set in a hospital where the doctor gets involved in the story of each patient's life. 

Your second statement assumes the hospital has the capabilities of offering the best care. My local hospital didn't have a monoclonal antibody outpatient clinic set up until this week, and they had a poor set up for prescribing it for patients showing up at their doors. My friend went to the hospital with low blood oxygen, and was told his case was so mild he didn't qualify for the antibodies. He thought he had pneumonia but the hospital wouldn't do an X-ray because the physical exam didn't show clear signs of it. He came back to the hospital two days later and was diagnosed with pneumonia, and when he asked about monoclonal antibodies, they said he had passed the treatment window the day before. So I imagine it would be frustrating being a doctor working under those conditions where you can't just order an x-ray or prescribe antibody treatment because the hospital can't handle demand, and then it would be easy to just start blaming the patients. 

I know a doctor working the ICU at the same hospital and that's her attitude. Everytime I talk to her she bitches about all the unvaccinated patients in the hospital, but they only just now thought to set up a monoclonal outpatient treatment clinic to help keep people out of the hospital, this after another hospital on the other side of the island has been advertising one for a couple months.

Where it gets creepy is when the conservative mindset, of needing a hierarchy in place where some people deserve to do well and any disruption to that hierarchy is a zero sum game has to be resisted, comes into play. 

It starts as complaints about only the disabled and elderly being vulnerable to the virus, so why is everyone else suffering constraints? Keep them isolated, and if they die, well that's a bummer, but grannie should want to die to keep the economy open, right?

Then when you talk about comorbidities, the framing gets darker, usually focused on obesity. The subtext turns into ""well it's those fatties fault."" 

A lot of these people with more authoritarian leanings are relishing the idea that a virus will purge the undesirables from society without them having to lift a finger. Or at the very least show how THEY are special for surviving. 

The most sinister of them see that minorites tend to be hit harder but the virus in the United States for various systemic reasons. 

So when we as a society take action to protect people they don't like AND it inconveniences them they go batshit crazy.

This attitude is becoming more and more common and I can assume it is because of how the unvaccinated have been portrayed in the media, which I think is a small minority. And it leads to mocking them if they do get sick and going as far to hope they die. That isn't helpful for anyone - not helpful when they are trying to urge more people to get vaccinated, and not helpful for their own mental health.

Only a handful of states have a smaller percentage of Republicans.  All of those states are doing extremely well with covid.  It's not a coincidence that states with the highest percentage of the party that cared to listen to science are doing better and have healthier populations.  I am not political and do not care about either party, but if someone asked me which party cared the most about it's voters, I would point to these facts.  The answer is obvious.  Republicans are literally killing off their voters.
